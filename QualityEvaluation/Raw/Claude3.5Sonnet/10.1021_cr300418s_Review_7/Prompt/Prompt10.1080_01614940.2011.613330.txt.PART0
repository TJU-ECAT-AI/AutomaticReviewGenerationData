Li/MgO is one of the most frequently investigated catalysts for the oxidative coupling
of methane. Besides catalytic testing, it is also a suitable system to perform surface
science experiments and quantum chemical calculations, which is not possible for many
other active catalysts. However, the real structure of Li/MgO, the nature of the active
center and the structure - activity relationship remain unclear, despite all the research
that has been done. The aim of this review is to summarize the available knowledge
on Li/MgO to structure and accelerate and improve the ongoing work on this catalytic
system.

1. INTRODUCTION
The resources of natural gas rival those of crude oil. The composition of nat-
ural gas depends on its origin, but the main component is always methane.
Therefore, there is a large economical interest in making methane available as
a carbon source for the chemical industry.

Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 425
A direct way for the conversion of methane into value added products is the
oxidative coupling (OCM) to ethane or ethylene. The overall pathway is shown
in Reaction 1. This reaction has attracted a lot of attention since the funda-
mental work of Keller and Bhasin and Hinsen and Baerns (1, 2). However,
until now no economically viable process has been put into practice despite all
efforts (36).

rH(800 C) = 139 kJ/mol
rG(800 C) = 153 kJ/mol
The coupling of methane without an oxidant is a highly endothermic
reaction and due to thermodynamic constraint the conversion is limited.
By introducing an oxidizing agent, the process becomes exothermic and the
thermodynamic restrictions can be overcome. However, from a thermody-
namic point of view, the partial oxidation (Reaction 2) and the total oxidation
(Reaction 3) are thermodynamically much more favored than the oxidative
coupling of methane.

To obtain reasonable yields of C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 and C2H4), the reac-
tion must be controlled kinetically. For this, suitable catalysts are necessary.
However, the known catalysts are not very active at low temperatures; thus,
the reaction requires temperatures between 700900 C, which leads to low
yields (due to consecutive COx formation) and severe catalyst deactivation (due
to decomposition or sintering, caused by the high reaction temperatures).
In the past, the research strategy was often characterized by random test-
ing of catalysts with a focus on maximization of the C2 yield. This strategy has

not led to a final breakthrough with respect to high selectivity and yield of C2
hydrocarbons. Thus, studying only one catalytic system to understand the rea-
sons for these limitations in detail is necessary. The outcome of this research
may be the basis for further efforts in optimizing catalyst formulations and
maximizing catalyst performance. At a later stage, high throughput testing of
numerous different catalysts may be of advantage. A combinatorial approach
could also be a suitable strategy to establish a structure activity relationship,
as recently reported (7).
In the search for better catalysts, hundreds of materials have been
tested. Li-doped MgO showed higher performance than most other materials.
Lunsford et al. were among the first to publish extensive details about this
catalytic system (810). Li-doped MgO was and still is the object of intensive
studies for several research groups. Studies on MgO doped with other alkali
metals did not lead to better catalysts (1116).
In spite of all the research that has been done, many aspects remain
unclear. As it will be outlined in this review, the active center, the maximum
solubility of Li in the MgO lattice, the position and nature of Li in the MgO,
the stability of the catalyst, and many other questions are still not answered,
despite the substantial amount of literature published on this topic. Therefore,
identifying the points that need further investigation is not easy. The aim of
this article is to summarize the existing knowledge on Li/MgO and point out
problems and unclarities that need further investigation.
Moreover, it is possible to perform quantum chemical studies and surface
science experiments on Li-doped MgO, which is a rather difficult task for many
other catalysts. Such studies will identify the role and importance of different
surface species within the catalytic reaction pathway. This information will
be used for the design of catalysts with better performance. A very important
question is the presence of species that contribute to unselective reactions, that
should be avoided.
This publication focuses on Li/MgO and where necessary on MgO. Further
additives on Li/MgO are only discussed in Section 6. Engineering aspects are
not within the scope of this publication, although a variety of reports exist
dealing with the engineering aspects of Li/MgO (1727).

PREPARATION OF LI/MGO CATALYSTS
The preparation of the Li/MgO catalyst is crucial for its performance and many
different methods have been used as described below.
2.1.
Wet Impregnation
In the first publications from the Lunsford group (810), a suspension
of Li2CO3 in deionized H2O was added to MgO. The slurry was stirred and
Downloaded by [University of Wyoming Libraries] at 01:49 27 September 2013 
Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 427
heated until a thick paste remained, which was dried overnight at 140 C.
The obtained material was calcined for one to several hours at temperatures
between 450 and 465 C under flow of O2.
Korf et al. synthesized Li/MgO via wet impregnation of MgO with an aque-
ous solution of LiOH (28). The procedure was done under a stream of CO2 for
some samples. Afterwards, the samples were dried at 140 C, calcined in air at
various temperatures, and then crushed and sieved.
Matsuura et al. prepared Li/MgO via adding Li2O to a suspension of ultra
fine crystalline MgO in C2H5OH, followed by drying at 78 C and calcination
at 740 C for 4 h. The use of ultra fine crystalline MgO resulted in a catalyst
with an exceptionally high activity for the OCM (29).
Choudhary and co-workers reported a highly stable Li/MgO, which showed
no deactivation for 15 h on stream (temperature: 750 C; feed gas composi-
tion: CH4:O2 = 4:1; flow rate: 85 ml/min) (30). This Li/MgO was prepared
by impregnation of Mg(CH3COO)2 with aqueous Li(CH3COO) and subsequent
calcination. The stability was attributed to the high content of CO2, which
reduced the loss of Li and improved the resistance against sintering of the
catalyst.
The Li precursor was reported to play an important role in the nature of
the surface species and the development of the specific surface of the Li/MgO
catalyst (3133). Also the precursors for MgO (which was either obtained by
thermal decomposition of hydroxy carbonates or the precipitation of nitrates)
had an influence on the Li/MgO, indicating a memory effect of the catalyst
with regard to the MgO precursor.
Choudhary et al. studied the influence of the precursors for Li2O and MgO
for the surface and catalytic properties of Li/MgO in more detail (34). They
prepared the catalysts by thorough mixing of the precursor powders in deion-
ized H2O. The precursors for Li were nitrate, ethanoate, and carbonate. For
MgO, the precursors were nitrate, ethanoate, carbonate, oxide, and hydroxides
(MgO from Mg(OH)2 was prepared using different Mg salts and precipitation
agents). The amount of added water was just sufficient to form a thick paste.
Subsequent drying at 120 C for 4 h and calcination at 750 C for 6 h followed.
The CH4 conversion, the C2 yield (C2H6 + C2H4), and the C2+ yield (C2H6 +
C2H4 + higher hydrocarbons), comprising the formation of C2H6 and C2H4 for
C2 and the formation of all hydrocarbons in the case of C2+, were reported
for different temperatures, feed gas compositions, and gas flows. In Figure 1
the reported data as described in Tables 4 and 6 of reference (34) are plotted.
The precursors for Li2O and MgO had a strong effect on the surface area, the
basicity, the CO2 content, and the catalytic performance, but a strong vari-
ation of the catalytic results was not observed. However, a direct relationship
between these factors could not be observed. In agreement with other groups, it
was found that catalysts with a high CO2 content showed a better performance
in the OCM.

and a gas flow of 8.6 ml/min. The green circles were obtained at 650 C, the red squares at
750 C. The selectivity was calculated from the formula SC2+ = YC2+/XCH4. The plotted data are
derived from Table 4 of (34). Variations cannot be observed. Right Part: The applied reaction
conditions were 100 mg catalyst, temperature of 750 C, and a gas flow of 17.1 ml/min. The
blue diamonds were obtained at a CH4 to O2 ratio of 3.0 and the black triangles at a CH4 to
O2 ratio of 8.0. The selectivity was calculated from the formula SC2+ = YC2+/XCH4. The plotted
data are taken from Table 6 of (34). Strong variations of the results can also not be observed
(color figure available online).
Kuo and co-workers tried to increase the specific surface area of the
Li/MgO via adding charcoal during the preparation (using a wet impreg-
nation procedure of MgO with Li2CO3) and subsequent burning off during
the calcination (35). Indeed, the result was that the addition of charcoal did
increase the surface area and it also modified the morphology of the Li/MgO;
however, no major improvement in terms of the yield was achieved.
2.2.
Molecular Mixing
Lpez et al. prepared Li-doped MgO via a sol-gel method. They studied
the effect of the pH value on the surface hydroxylation and characterized
the prepared MgO (36). It was found that Li/MgO catalysts prepared via the
sol-gel method had comparable activities to Li/MgO catalysts prepared by
wet impregnation of commercial MgO, but significantly higher C2 selectivities
(37, 38).
Trionfetti and co-workers showed that via sol-gel synthesis a high surface-
area, nano-scale Li/MgO could be prepared, with low Li loadings (39, 40). This
procedure limited the formation of separate Li phases, therefore, suppressing
sintering and loss of surface area during thermal treatment. Furthermore, the

application of high temperatures to incorporate Li into the MgO lattice could
be avoided. It was reported that it had a strongly improved activity for the
oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of C3H8 compared to Li/MgO prepared via
wet impregnation.
A co-precipitation procedure was described by Roussy and co-workers (41).
To an aqueous solution of Mg(NO3)2 and LiOH, oxalic acid was added until
a pH of 2.2 was reached. The precipitate was obtained and dried at 120 C
and calcined at 750 C under argon for 24 h. The catalytic performance was
compared for the cases of classical and micro-wave heating, showing a high
improvement of the selectivity in the case of micro-wave heating.
Chevalier et al. applied a surface organo-metallic approach for the prepara-
tion of Li/MgO (42). The Li is introduced to the MgO surface via Li-neopentyl,
as shown in Reaction 4.

(4)
In contrast to Lunsford, the applied preparation procedure led to a pre-
cursor catalyst, which did not contain anions such as carbonate species. The
prepared catalyst was more active but less selective towards the formation of
C2 products than the Lunsford catalyst.
The group of Dreiss applied a single source precursors approach. They pre-
pared magnesium alkoxide clusters, which were thermally decomposed. The
substitution of a Mg atom for a Li atom in one corner of the cubane, led to
the formation of Li/MgO (43, 44). A reaction scheme of the cubane synthe-
sis is shown in Figure 2. The prepared material was characterized in detail;
however, its catalytic performance is presently under investigation.
2.3.
Other Methods
Berger et al. applied chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the preparation
of Li-doped MgO nanoparticles (45).
The addition of SiO2 to Li/MgO via hydrothermal treatment led to basic
magnesium hydrosilicates. If the added amount of silica was not too large

430 S. Arndt et al.
(Si/MgO ratio of 0.0 to 1.2), the catalyst became more active and selective
towards C2H4, however, the overall C2+ selectivity remained unchanged. The
addition of SiO2 reduced the evaporation of Li and increased the specific
surface area, which resulted in a more stable catalyst (46).
Sarkas and co-workers prepared unsupported nanocrystalline Li/MgO
using an inert gas condensation-based smoke source and applied it in the
oxidative coupling of methane (47). One sample showed total oxidation activ-
ity already at 300 C, a temperature where conventional catalysts are still not
active.
Choudhary et al. synthesized Li/MgO supported on commonly used sup-
ports, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, HfO2, SiC, and SiO2 containing materials (48).
Conversion and selectivity were approximately reduced by a factor of 3,
compared to unsupported Li/MgO. This observation was attributed to the
reduction of the surface basicity, which could be an effect of a strong interac-
tion of the supported material with the support. With Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2,
the formation of mixed oxides containing Li or MgO was found, indicating that
these materials are not suitable as inert carriers.
The gel-combustion technique, which was reported for Pt nanoparticles
(49), was recently applied for the synthesis of Li-doped MgO (50). A series of
different Li loadings was prepared by thermal ignition of the metal nitrates in
a mixture of glycerol and ethanol, with subsequent calcination in argon or air
at 800 C for 2 h. Detailed catalytic data was not reported, since the study was
focused on the structure and morphology.
2.4.
Summary
A variety of preparation procedures, including wet impregnation, sol-
gel, and organometallic approaches, have been reported so far. The wet
impregnation is by far the most applied procedure, used in more than 80%
of the publications. Compared to this, other important procedures like co-
precipitation, solid state reactions, mixed milling, or combustion synthesis are
comparably underrepresented in the literature. Unfortunately, a direct com-
parison of the catalytic performance of the differently synthesized materials is
very difficult due to vastly varying testing conditions.
In studies on the active center, many publications follow the suggestions
of Driscoll et al. that the active center is [Li+O] (10) (see also Section 5.4).
However, the main preparative route in these publications has been wet
impregnation. In this approach, it is necessary to calcine at high temperatures
to enable the Li to diffuse into the MgO. But this also accelerates side reactions,
like evaporation of Li or carbonate formation and decomposition. Moreover,
some publications applied rather low calcination temperatures. It remains
unclear if these temperatures are sufficient for the diffusion of Li into the MgO.

Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 431
Other preparative routes, although they are more intricated and more
sophisticated, should be more suitable for the preparation Li/MgO solid solu-
tions and, therefore, of [Li+O]. Moreover, the molecular mixing should result
in a catalyst that is less pronounced to a phase separation of Li- and Mg-
containing phases. However, these preparation procedures have hardly been
applied.
For wet impregnation, it was shown that the properties of the obtained
catalyst (surface basicity, surface area, CO2 content, etc.) depend on the used
precursors. A strong variation of the catalytic results was not observed and a
correlation between the properties and the catalytic performance was not fond.
The realized studies on the preparation of Li/MgO could not reveal the
essential factors determining the catalytic performance so far. A comparative
study of differently prepared Li/MgO materials, applying the same reaction
conditions for the catalytic tests, could therefore be useful.

STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION
3.1.
Basicity and Acidity
The effect of the basicity and acidity on the OCM has already been the
subject of discussion, including not only Li/MgO (51, 52) but also other OCM
catalysts. However, as the following review shows, no consensus has been
reached how basicitiy and acidity influence OCM performance, since there
are different kinds of basic sites with different strength and there is no
unambiguous correlation between the C2 selectivity and the basicity.
3.1.1.
Pure MgO
Davydov and co-workers studied basic sites of various oxides used as cat-
alysts in the oxidative coupling of methane via infrared spectroscopy (IR) of
adsorbed molecules such as CO2 (53, 54). It was demonstrated that the basic
sites can be titrated with CO2. The correlation between the spectral behavior
of the carbonates and the strength allowed a discrimination between the dif-
ferent sites. The presence and concentration of the strongest basic sites were
reported to determine the catalytic activity.
Ku
s et al. observed that both the presence or absence of impurities, such as
Ca or Na, and the gas atmosphere during calcination also influenced surface
basicity (55, 56).
Bailly and co-workers studied the nature of possible active sites of
MgO by investigating the relationship between the thermodynamic Brnsted
basicity and reactivity of basic sites (CH3OH deprotonation and conversion
of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (MBOH)) (57). The relative distribution of low coor-
dinated O2was varied via different preparative routes and measured via

photoluminescence. Moreover, the hydroxylation of clean MgO surfaces and its
influence on the Brnsted basicity were studied. Hydroxylated surfaces were
found to be more reactive, although they had a lower deprotonation ability
than clean surfaces. The specific reactivity of OH groups, compared to low
coordinated O2, was found to be determined by the variable stability of the
resulting alcoholate intermediates. As OH groups are poor Brnsted bases,
the number of alcoholate species is lower on clean surfaces, however, these
intermediates were less stabilized and therefore more reactive.
Chizallet et al. used 1H Mas NMR (MASmagic angle spinning; NMR
nuclear magnetic resonance) to distinguish between different OH groups that
can exist on a defective MgO surface (58, 59). They found a clear correla-
tion between the area of NMR signals below 0.7 ppm chemical shift and the
conversion of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol (MBOH) to acetone and acetylene as test
reaction. As these NMR signals 0.7 ppm could be identified as hydroxyl
groups coordinated to surface Mg2+ ions, these OLC-H sites (LClow coordi-
nation), with L = 1, 2, were reported as active sites. DFT (Density Functional
Theory) calculations showed that nucleophilicity of the OLC groups rather than
basicity of the surface oxygen ions determines reactivity towards MBOH con-
version. No statement was made whether the same holds for reactivity and/or
selectivity in methane oxidative coupling.
3.1.2.
Li/MgO
The surface basicity and acidity of MgO promoted with alkali metals (Li,
Na, K, Rb, and Cs), prepared via impregnation, was compared with the cat-
alytic performance of these materials (16). The surface properties strongly
depended on the promoter and on the calcination temperature. The follow-
ing order was found for the BET surface area after preparation: Li/MgO 
Na/MgO Rb/MgO K/MgO Cs/MgO. Acidic sites of different strengths
were found, and basic sites were found to be broadly distributed and strongly
influenced by the promoter. A correlation between the density of the strongly
basic sites and the formation of C2 products per unit surface area was observed.
In another study using other dopants (Li2O, Na2O, PbO, La2O3, MgCl2,
CaCl2), the result was a significant increase in surface basicity, without sig-
nificant correlation between basicity and C2 yield (60). This was considered
as an indication that further factors play an important role for the catalytic
performance.
The acid-base properties and the base-catalyzed elimination reaction of
2-propanol, giving either acetone or propylene, was studied for MgO and alkali-
doped MgO by Dez et al. (61). The basic properties depended on the relative
concentration of certain surface species (OH groups, for instance). The addi-
tion of alkali metals, prepared via impregnation, increased the density of basic
sites and also modified the strength. Dopants with a higher electron-donating

strength led to the formation of stronger basic sites. The activity in the test
reaction also increased with an increasing base strength.
3.2.
Structure and Properties
The known literature about the morphological aspects of OCM catalysts,
among them Li/MgO, is summarized in detail in a book chapter of Martin
and Mirodatos (62). The loss of Li, the phase organization of Li/MgO, and the
influence of the surface area and the structure on the OCM is discussed. In the
present review, the aspects are discussed in the following sections.
3.2.1.
Pure MgO
Spoto and co-workers reviewed the research on the adsorption of CO on
MgO, in the form of single crystals, films, and powders (63). CO was chosen as
a test molecule because it can react with both Mg2+ and O2. Results obtained
via IR and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were
considered in particular. However, the results of other techniques are described
as well. It was shown that the gap between surface science experiments and
powders, as typically used in catalysis, can be progressively bridged.
Choudhary and co-workers reported that the thermal decomposition of
MgCO3 leads to MgO, which was highly active in the OCM (64). They found
a strong influence of the preparation conditions on the thermal decomposition
and the surface properties (surface area, total basicity, base strength distri-
bution) (65, 66). That the surface properties of MgO, prepared from Mg(OH)2,
also depends on the preparation and calcination conditions had been shown
before (67).
Ardizzone et al. applied X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study
different precursors for MgO (68, 69). Different defects were characterized and
considered to be responsible for the activation step of CH4 in the OCM. From
the experimental data obtained at different temperatures, it had been shown
that the chemical state and the basicity of MgO is a result of the competition
of O2, hydrocarbon, and H2O for the different reactive surface sites.
Mellor and co-workers investigated the impact of the MgO structure on
the heterolytic oxygen exchange with the surface (70). Either the particle size
or the termination plane was varied. The exchange was independent of the
particle size (particles with a (100) termination plane were used). The activity
order of different planes was (111) or (110) mean surface planes > (100) >
(111), indicating that low coordinated Mg2+O2pairs play a beneficial role.
3.2.2.
Li/MgO
Kimble and Kolts showed in thermogravimetric studies with different
phases of Li/MgO that Li is present as LiOH, if prepared from LiNO3 or as
Li2CO3, if prepared from Li2CO3 (71). They reported, that the LiOH exposed

434 S. Arndt et al.
to the reaction gas at 700 C was converted to Li2CO3. Treating MgO with the
same conditions, it did not gain weight, suggesting that no change took place.
If treated at 775 C in a N2 atmosphere, Li2CO3/MgO showed a partial decom-
position of the carbonate. The decomposition was completed at 900 C. Being
exposed to the reaction mixture at 700 C, it was converted back to Li2CO3.
If H2O was added at 700 C, the quantity of carbonate seemed to decrease.
Kimble and Kolts assumed that in return the amount of hydroxides increased.
Cycles of carbonate formation and decomposition did not effect the activity as
a catalyst. It was assumed that in the presence of a mixture of CO2 and H2O
an equilibrium will be established, with carbonate as the predominant species
(72). A loss of Li during the calcination of the Li/MgO was reported. The loss
of Li from the catalyst at high temperatures under reaction conditions was
also reported by Kimble and Kolts (73). Moreover, it was reported that the
Li content was stabilized at approximately 1% when supported on CaO. That a
limit for the maximum concentration of Li could exist, was underlined by these
authors.
The chemistry of Li in Li/MgO during the OCM was investigated by Korf
et al. (74). Their conlcusions were:
1.
Behavior of Li/MgO was found to depend strongly on the preparation
procedure.
2.
Passing CO2 through the solution while impregnating MgO led to higher
amounts of Li2CO3 and segregation of Li to the surface of the catalyst.
3.
The optimum loading of Li in the fresh catalyst was reported to be 24 wt%.
4.
The active site was formed on the surface by a gradual decomposition of
Li2CO3 in the presence of O2. The absence of O2 had an adverse effect on
the activity.
5.
The active sites were found to be unstable. The deactivation was due to a
loss of Li, via evaporating of the volatile LiOH or the formation of Li2SiO3,
from Li and the quartz glass material of the reactor. H2O in the feed had,
therefore, an adverse effect.
6.
In hot spot areas, the loss of Li was reported to occur most rapidly.

CO2 in the feed was found to lead to:
a. reversible poisoning of the active site,
b. but also to stabilization of the active site against deactivation.

Measures for a stable catalyst points out that:

b. periodic reversal of the flow direction improves the stability,
c. application of an Al2O3 instead of a quartz glass reactor can improve
the stability.
While investigating the reaction of CO2 during the oxidative coupling of
methane, Galuszka found that a substantial amount of Li formed a carbonate,
which was stable up to 800 C (75). The carbonate formation started at 400 C,
as shown via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), temperature
programmed reaction (TPR), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD).
Interestingly, several hours of calcination at 800 C were necessary to remove
the CO2 from the catalyst. There was no CO2 on pure MgO above 600 C, there-
fore, chemisorbed CO2 on Li/MgO above 600 C had to be attributed to the Li.
Furthermore, different types of carbonates can be assumed, and they should
have different properties and activities. However, the identification of surface
species by IR has proven to be difficult (76, 77).
In the publication of Ito et al., the optimum loading of Li was reported
to be 7 wt% (9). In a later discussion, it was noted that for achieving a
monolayer of Li+ on MgO ca. 0.2 wt% Li is required, which is a relatively
low loading (78). Therefore, Hutchings and co-workers reinvestigated the
optimum loading of Li on MgO (79). They found that a sub-monolayer loading,
i.e., the above-mentioned 0.2 wt% Li, enhances the activation of CH4 and the
selectivity towards coupling products, indicating that the optimum loading of
Li is much lower than reported in previous publications, e.g., 7 wt% reported
by Ito et al. (9).
Hargreaves and co-workers investigated the morphology of Li/MgO and
its relationship to catalytic performance (8083). For pure MgO, it was
demonstrated that the morphology is an important factor for the catalytic per-
formance in the oxidative coupling of methane. The addition of Li to MgO
led to changes due to grain growth. It was concluded that corner and edge
sites did not significantly contribute to the catalytic activity. A special bot-
tom step site was suggested to be the active center. For Li/MgO, immobile
dislocations were detected in the bulk of these grains. It was suggested that
pinning of these dislocations by Li led to the formation of [Li+O], a fre-
quently suggested candidate for the role of the active sites, as outlined in
Section 5.4.
The results of Hargreaves et al. (8083) were confirmed via atomistic sim-
ulation techniques by Lewis group (84). They also showed that the presence of
Li increased the concentration of oxygen defects (in the form of [Li+O]) and
promoted their segregation to surface sites. [Li+O] centers were reported to
be trapped in low coordinated surface sites, which should lead to a modified
activity. They assumed that the activity of pure, undoped MgO was the result
of more complex surface defects.

The relationship between surface morphology and reactivity was investi-
gated by testing several differently prepared and well-characterized MgO and
Li/MgO catalysts by the group of Lunsford (85). The comparison of the results
showed that the surface area and the morphology did not have a significant
impact on the OCM. However, small structural effects, which could have a
strong catalytic impact, might have remained undetected.
Berger et al. observed the changes of the surface properties of MgO when
small amounts of Li were introduced (45). It was found that the addition of only
0.2 at% Li to pure MgO decreased already the thermal stability of the resulting
material. After the Li segregated to the surface, it changed the spectroscopic
properties significantly (e.g., IR fingerprint of active hydroxyls and hydrides,
surface-trapped electrons, and adsorbed oxygen radicals). It was concluded
that Li preferentially moves to surface sites associated with low coordinated
ions and higher surface reactivity.
Choudhary et al. investigated MgO, Li/MgO, and MgO doped with other
additives as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane (86). The doping
with Li led to a severe sintering of the MgO and, therefore, to lower specific
surface areas. The selectivity obtained with the doped material increased sig-
nificantly. It was found that the C2 selectivity increased nearly linearly with
the decrease of the specific surface area. The involvement of lattice oxygen of
the catalysts was investigated in a pulsed micro-reactor (87). It was found that
with increasing pulse number, in each pulse only CH4 was dosed to the reac-
tor, the conversion of CH4 decreased sharply, and the C2 selectivity increased.
It was concluded that lattice oxygen was involved. The re-oxidation of the cat-
alysts after the pulses, led to a decrease of the C2 selectivity as compared with
fresh catalyst. The reason could be the formation of active chemisorbed species
and/or restructuring of the catalyst surface.
Sinev et al. studied the redox properties of differing catalyst, among them
Li/MgO (88). Based on the results, a new mechanism for the catalyst re-
oxidation was suggested, viz. that under steady state, the re-oxidation can
proceed via the oxidative dehydrogenation of surface OH groups.
Taniewski and co-workers oxidized C2H4 over Li/MgO without co-feeding
of O2, to obtain information on the oxidation properties of Li/MgO (89). Since
large amounts of CO and H2 were found, it was clearly demonstrated that
Li/MgO exhibits a high oxygen mobility. After the reduction of the catalyst, it
was possible to restore the activity by its re-oxidation with air. The results on
the oxidation of C2H4 can also be used to draw conclusions about the fate of
C2H4 in the post-catalytic zone, being still in the reactor.
Anderson and Norby analyzed the liquid phases in Li/MgO by means
of thermoanalytical and electrical conductivity measurements and electron
microscopy (90). The results indicated that the solubility of Li in MgO
increases with increasing oxygen activity, which is also predicted by defect

theory. At 700 C and in a CO2-rich, oxidizing atmosphere, the solubility of Li
in MgO was estimated to be in the order of magnitude of 0.1 mol%, respectively
0.02 wt%.
Pure MgO is a poor electronic conductor at low temperatures, however,
doping with Li leads to p-type semiconductivity (91, 92). Norby and Anderson
studied the electrical conductivity of sintered Li/MgO at different temper-
atures (1200 C) and under different O2 partial pressures. The effect of
H2O and CO2 was also investigated. It was found that Li dissolves in MgO,
such that an Mg2+ is being substituted by Li+, forming a negative defect and
increasing p-type conductivity, which was dominating at near atmospheric
O2 partial pressures and high temperatures. Surface and/or grain boundary
conductivity became important at intermediate temperatures (700
C),
which was also probably mainly due to p-type conductivity. It was observed
that Li readily evaporated from the surface at high temperatures and that Si
containing impurities reacted with Li/MgO forming non-conducting silicate
phases. Under ambient pressures of H2O or H2, proton defects seemed to play
a minor role (93).
When measuring the direct current (DC) conductivity of Li/MgO as a func-
tion of H2O vapor and O2 partial pressure, Balint and Aika observed that
proton species dominated the conductivity at low temperatures (400 C) (94),
p-type conductivity dominated at high temperatures (800900 C), correspond-
ing to the results of Norby and Anderson, which indicated a mixed conduction
mechanism at intermediate temperatures (500700 C). A mechanism was
proposed in which doping with Li leads to the formation of oxygen vacan-
cies, which play an important role in the generation of Osites. These oxygen
vacancies were believed to be blocked by hydrogen defects at low temperatures.
Balint and Aika investigated the defect sites formed when MgO was doped
with Li or Ti (95). Pure MgO and Li/MgO always exhibited p-type conductivity,
whereas Ti/MgO showed n-type conductivity. Doping with Li favored the for-
mation of oxygen vacancies, while doping with Ti had the inverse effect. That
showed that the defect structure of MgO can be controlled via doping. Tardo
and co-workers also determined p-type semiconductor properties of Li/MgO
single crystals (96).
For MgO and Li/MgO, the dependency of DC conductivity on the partial
pressures of O2 and H2O was investigated at OCM temperature (97, 98). The
DC conductivity of Li/MgO increased with increasing O2 pressures, indicat-
ing a p-type conductivity of this material. The effect of H2O was stronger
on MgO than on Li/MgO. A model for the defect generation due to H2O
inclusion was proposed. Two different activation energies for DC conductivity
were found, one at low temperatures (400600 C) the other at high tempera-
tures (700900 C). Based on the pressure dependencies, different conductivity
mechanisms were proposed. For the low temperature, an OH-vehicle mech-
anism and at high temperature a p-type mechanism due to Odefects was

proposed. TPD experiments showed the release of H2 above 600 C. Therefore,
a mechanism with O-H bond rapture for the formation of Odefects in the
high temperature region was proposed.
That the electronic semiconductor properties could be very important fea-
tures of catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane, has also been discussed
in a review of Zhang and co-workers [5].
In 1971, Abraham and co-workers reported a variation of the carbon arc-
fusion technique, which allowed them to grow highly pure MgO and CaO
single crystals. This method was successfully applied for doping single crys-
tals of MgO with a variety of different metals, Li for instance (99). Electron
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) experiments with a variety of
different alkali earth metals with alkaline doping indicated the formation
of [Li+O] centers. Schirmer provided evidence using EPR, that the Li sub-
stitutes an Mg in the MgO lattice (100). Electron nuclear double resonance
(ENDOR) experiments supported this finding (101, 102). The formation of
[Li+O] centers is favored by heavy electron irradiation and high tempera-
ture quenching, which were stable at room temperature. However, γ -radiation
resulted in the formation of these centers, but they were not stable at room
temperature. EPR and ENDOR experiments revealed that the defects pro-
duced via different ways had the same local configuration (101, 103). The
irradiation with neutrons did not lead to stable [Li+O] centers (104). At high
temperatures, a Li2O precipitate led to the formation of a so called micro-
galaxy, i.e., a localized [Li+O]-rich environment in the neighborhood of the
precipitate. Diffusion in the MgO crystal and replacement of Mg2+ or formation
of vacancies followed (105). The formation of stable [Li+O] centers strongly
depended on the surrounding atmosphere, the presence of O2 was inevitable
for the thermal generation of the defects. The [Li+O] centers formed at higher
temperatures were stable, however, the cooling procedure effected the sta-
bility. When a slow cooling took place, the Li, which had diffused into the
MgO crystal, diffused back into the more stable Li-precipitates (106). Since
impurities, such as Fe and Cr, could not be avoided, the formation of [Li+O]
centers was partly accompanied by a valence change of these metals (107).
Interestingly, the [Li+O] centers were also found in CaO (108). From the
investigation of current-voltage characteristics, it was concluded, that at oxi-
dizing temperatures the crystals of Li/MgO had a significant effect on the
[Li+O] concentration and the electrical conductivity, thermal aging did not
seem to have a significant effect on these features (109). For further informa-
tion, the review of Chen and Abraham on trapped hole centers in alkali earth
oxides is recommended (110).
The solubility of hydrogen or deuterium was reported to be much higher
in Li/MgO than in pure MgO (104, 111). The mimimum temperature for a
diffusion of deuterium in pure MgO was reported to be 1477 C, for Li/MgO
the mimimum temperature was reported to be 527 C, the higher diffusivity

Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 439
was attributed to the presence of Li2O precipitates (111, 112). Furthermore, it
was observed that D2O adsorbs dissociatively on Li/MgO.
Matsuura et al. prepared Li/MgO using ultra fine crystaline MgO. A good
correlation between the intensity of the photoluminescence signal (at λ =
450 nm) and the activity was found, also indicating that lower coordinated
surface sites, which were formed through the incorporation of Li into the (111)
plane of MgO, are playing a significant role (29, 113).
Padr et al. studied Li/MgO with different Li loadings with x-ray diffrac-
tion (XRD), XPS, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to char-
acterize the surface and the catalytic behavior (114). It was found that the
catalytic behavior and the surface composition depend strongly on the Li load-
ing. Furthermore, it was concluded that di-oxygen species, e.g., O
2 could be
present at the surface and that a complex equilibrium between the surface
oxygen species and the Ocenters exists.
Aritani and co-workers characterized Li/MgO by means of XRD, XPS, Mg
K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and SEM techniques
(115, 116). It was found that for low Li loadings (2.5 wt%), Li ions tended to
stay in the near surface region. Furthermore, the surface Li tended to form
separate phases, without a strong effect on the surface MgO structure. For
higher Li loadings (7.5 wt%), the Li was also found in the bulk. An effect of
Li incorporation in the bulk was the reduction of the MgO crystallinity. The
Li-atomsbeing located in the near surface region and in the bulkhad an
effect on the activity in the OCM. It was assumed that the near surface defects
had a strong positive influence on the CH4 conversion, while the bulk defects
positively influenced the C2 selectivity.
The surface morphology of Li/MgO was investigated via low temperature
infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO by Trionfetti et al. (117). These authors
demonstrated that the morphology and the defect structure was of great impor-
tance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8. Step sites were unselective
sites and the major feature on the surface of pure MgO. When the MgO was
doped with Li, it tended to occupy the surface step sites and to replace Mg2+
(cf Figure 9). When the loading of Li was increased, the step sites were dec-
orated with Li+ and oxygen vacancies, leading to a higher reactivity. Li/MgO
prepared via sol gel, had higher amounts of incorporated Li and they showed
a higher selectivity in the ODH of C3H8 and the cracking of propane.
Myrach and co-workers recently tried to elucidate the role of Li in MgO, by
investigating two model systems: a MgO filmwith and without Li-doping
on Mo(001) and powder samples prepared via calcination of the respective
precursors in an O2-atmosphere (118). Their study mainly focused on the phys-
ical properties. It was found, that at low concentrations of Li, it most probably
incorporates into the MgO together with oxygen vacancies, changing the opti-
cal properties of the system. Above 427 C, the segregation of Li towards the
surface and the formation of irregular Li-enriched areas was observed. Above

777 C, Li desorbed from the MgO surface, leaving behind distinct defects. The
Li was not completely removed by heating, very small amounts dissolve in
the MgO, as indicated by different optical properties. The change of the optical
properties is shown in Figure 3. The principle possibility to detect [Li+O] with
EPR was demonstrated on Li/MgO single crystals from Oak Ridge National
Laboratories. EPR signals that could be assigned to the [Li+O] center, pro-
posed by Lunsford (10), which is often considered as the active center of this
material (as outlined in Section 5.4), were found neither on the Li/MgO films
nor in the powder samples. The possible reasons are absence, low concentra-
tion, or electron tunneling from the Mo(001) support into the hole centers.
However, the results do not exclude the general possibility of the formation
of [Li+O].
Recently, the preparation of Li/MgO from gel-combustion was reported
(50). Combined studies with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and SEM
were applied to characterize the structure and morphology. A hierarchical
pore structure was found for samples with low loadings of Li. Calcination at
800 C changed the morphology from cubic via truncated octahedral to platelet
morphologies, depending on the Li-loading. Indications were found that the
Li enhances this transformation. Modifications in the primary morphology of
the particles caused severe changes in the secondary structure. Edge-and-step
structures and protrusions on flat terraces were found to be the two kinds
of high-energy structures found in the micro-structure of the primary parti-
cles. It was reported that a relation between the transformation from cubic to
complex terminated particles and the catalytic function for the OCM existed.

Summary
MgO itself is a basic material with various basic, low coordinated and
defect sites. Doping with Li leads to a variety of modifications in the MgO
structure, partly depending on the added amount of Li. Surface defects are
induced, the surface area is reduced, and the spectroscopic properties and the
morphology changes upon Li addition.
In Li/MgO single crystals, it was found that Li can replace an Mg in the
MgO lattice, forming a [Li+O] defect, which was studied in detail by Abraham
et al. However, other suggestions were also made. In the mechanism proposed
by Balint and Aika, for instance, the Li is involved in the formation of oxygen
vacancies, which play a role in the formation of O. A complex equilibrium
between the different surface oxygen species exists, which is not yet fully
understood.
However, the Li was found to be instable in the Li/MgO catalyst. The
publications on the optimal Li-loading report very different amounts. There
seems to be an agreement that Li tends to form separate phases or at least
Li-enriched regions within the lattice.
The strong dependence of the presence of the different surface species
on preparation and operation conditions results in a complex picture of the
mechanism of OCM and the difficulty to derive clear structure-reactivity
relation.

CATALYTIC PERFORMANCE OF LI/MGO-BASED CATALYSTS
4.1.
Stability of Li/MgO-Based Catalysts
Ito et al. prepared Li/MgO catalysts with Li loadings of 1 to 26 wt%. All
these prepared materials showed a catalytic activity. They found that CH4 con-
version and C2+ selectivity increased with increasing reaction temperature up
to approximately 700 C (8, 9). After the catalytic tests, the specific surface
area of Li/MgO was considerably lower than the specific surface area of pure
MgO. A separate experiment with high and low surface area MgO (34 m2/g
and 8 m2/g), respectively, showed comparable conversions of 16%, but different
selectivities (5% and 29%). A deactivation experiment at 700 C with 7 wt %
Li/MgO was conducted. The catalyst was stable, after approximately 15 to
32 h time on stream. However, the reaction conditions applied for this test
were 1 g catalyst, 700 C, flow rate of 49.8 ml/min, and a feed gas composition
of CH4:O2:He = 3:1:21.3, being highly diluted. Ito et al. proposed that C2H6
forms via the coupling of two CH3· radicals. It was also found that C2H4 was
formed via the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6.
Mirodatos et al. studied the deactivation of MgO and Li/MgO in detail,
together with chemical and morphological changes (119). Two kinds of

442 S. Arndt et al.
sintering phenomena were found. At 727 C (the melting point of Li2CO3 is
720 C), the deactivation coincided with sintering of the solid, a loss of BET
surface area (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) and of Li. Nevertheless, at 634 C,
the deactivation coincided only with a reduction of the BET surface area, a
loss of Li was not found. The stability of the surface area depended on the
temperature treatment (the surface collapsed above 727 C) and on the gas
phase. In an O2 atmosphere, the surface was observed to be stable up to
634 C, it started sintering when it was in contact with the reaction gas mix-
ture. The formation of Li2CO3 significantly reduced the stability of the MgO
surface area, this was also shown for other dopants and other supports (120,
121). Li2CO3 was held responsible for the formation of COx (122); the increase
of the C2 selectivity with time on stream was, therefore, explained with the
decomposition of Li2CO3.
Choudhary and co-workers reported a highly stable Li/MgO, which showed
no deactivation for 15 h on stream (temperature: 750 C, 0.5 g catalyst, feed gas
composition: CH4:O2 = 4:1, flow: 85.6 ml/min) (30). The catalyst was prepared
via impregnation of Mg(CH3CO2)2 with aqueous Li(CH3CO2) and subsequent
calcination. The stability was attributed to the high content of CO2 (deter-
mined via heating the catalyst in a N2 flow), which reduced the loss of Li and
improved the resistance against sintering of the catalyst.
In their study on the nature of the active site of Li/MgO, van Kasteren and
co-workers compared the activity and deactivation of Li/MgO and Li2CO3 sup-
ported on ZrO2 (123). In terms of activity, for a 7 wt% home made Li/MgO,
an increase in O2 conversion and CH4 conversion is observed, until 16 h time
on stream, followed by a steady deactivation. The Li content decreased con-
tinuously throughout the experiment. For 0.2 wt% Li/MgO, deactivation and
loss of Li were observed from the beginning. However, Li2CO3/ZrO2 suffered
from a comparatively fast deactivation to nearly zero activity after approxi-
mately 15 h time on stream. The working principle of the catalysts derived
from these experiments is discussed in detail in Section 5.1. However, the
increase in activity in the first hours times on stream has not been reported by
other research groups, but the deactivation of the activity of Li/MgO has been
reported.
The catalyst deactivated due to a loss of Li as volatile LiOH or as Li2SiO3,
due to the fact that the laboratory reactors are made of quartz glass (123).
This result was confirmed by Korf and co-workers (28, 74). A consequence is,
that the use of experimental equipment made of quartz glass had a negative
effect on the stability of Li/MgO. Figure 4 shows the result of a deactivation
experiment with and without quartz dilution. It is evident that without quartz,
the deactivation process is strongly retarded. After the experiment done by
Korf et al. (28), the Li content had fallen to 0.1 wt%, which is significantly
lower than previously described by other authors (73, 119). The reason could
be the higher reaction temperature.

Rapid deactivation of Li/MgO was observed by Korf et al. (124). They also
showed that, if Li was still available, the catalyst could be regenerated by treat-
ment with CO2 under reaction conditions. The deactivation could be avoided if
CO2 was added to the reaction mixture in low concentrations. Furthermore,
they concluded that CO2 temporarily poisoned the active site and simulta-
neously stabilized it against deactivation; the selectivity was not affected by
the CO2 addition (28, 124). The selectivity did not change much in their long-
term experiments, therefore, the conclusion was that the nature of the active
site had not changed much, but their number decreased. For Li/Nb/MgO, the
prevention of deactivation by adding CO2 could not be observed (125).
Aigler and Lunsford studied the oxidative coupling of methane over MgO
and Li/MgO monoliths (126). Pure MgO was more active but less selective for
the formation of C2 products, than Li/MgO. This high activity of pure MgO
was at least partly attributed to Ca2+ impurities, which were concentrated at
the surface.
The addition of silica to Li/MgO via hydrothermal treatment led to basic
magnesium hydrosilicates. If the added amount of silica was not too large, the
catalyst became more active and selective towards C2H4, however, the overall
C2+ selectivity remained unchanged. Furthermore, silica addition reduced the
evaporation of Li and it increased the specific surface area, resulting in a more
stable catalyst (46).
Roos and co-workers tested a series of different catalysts, MgO, Li/MgO
(3.8% and 5.3% Li), Cu/MgO, Na/Al2O3, Ca/Al2O3, Bi/Al2O3, Mn/Al2O3,
Pb/Al2O3, Na/Pb/Al2O3, Fe/Cr/Al2O3, Bi2Sn2O7, and SiC (127). The Li- and

Pb-containing materials seemed to have a superior catalytic performance
compared to the other tested materials; and Li/MgO was found to be more
stable than the Pb-containing ones.
Galuszka showed that carbonate-free Li/MgO initially showed a good
activity, but it decreased after 20 min on stream. The deactivation, the appear-
ance of CO2, and the disappearance of C2H4 coincided. Furthermore, he found
that a substantial amount of Li formed carbonate, which was stable until
800 C (75).
Hutchings et al. compared O2 and O3 as an oxygen source for the OCM
over Li/MgO (128). In their study, they observed that the catalysts steadily
lost their activity because of sintering and recrystallization.
Perrichon and Durupty investigated the thermal stability of Li, Na, and K
deposited on MgO, SiO2, Al2O3, and Cr2O3 (121). It was found that on SiO2,
Al2O3, and Cr2O3 the alkali metals are rather stable, however, on MgO a loss
of alkali metal was observed at calcination temperatures higher than 500 C.
This effect increased from Li to K at 800 C, showing that the loss of alkali met-
als is not limited to Li. A reason for this could be that MgO is not able to form
stable compounds, unlike SiO2, Al2O3, and Cr2O3, which can form silicates,
aluminates, and chromates. Supports impregnated with alkali metals always
had a lower surface area; the temperature had no influence on this. This effect
was explained with the formation of a conglomerate of alkali metal salt and
support. Furthermore, it was assumed that the alkali metal phase, which
was present at the interface between the support particles, underwent trans-
formations, especially fusion during sintering. Therefore, it induced partial
dissolution of the support and, thus, the growth of larger crystals.
Choudhary et al. observed the effect of doping MgO and Li/MgO with Mn,
Cd, and Zn on the catalytic activity in the OCM. The addition of the dopants
caused a severe sintering of the MgO, resulting in a decreased specific sur-
face area, but the selectivity also significantly increased. It was found that the
C2 selectivity increased nearly linearly with the decrease of the specific sur-
face area. After 12 h time on stream, the conversion of CH4 of Li/MgO was
approximately 35% (reaction conditions: feed gas composition CH4:O2:N2 =
2.3:1:10.4, temperature 780 C, flow 60 ml/min, and 0.2 ml catalyst). Doping
with Mn, Cd, and Zn led to a generally lower conversion, in the range of
2530%. However, the Li-promoted catalysts suffered from heavy sintering and
deactivation during the catalytic experiments (86).
Al-Zahrani and co-workers studied the effect of CO2, steam and liquid
water treatment, and the process conditions on the oxidative coupling of
methane over Li/MgO (129131). It was shown that CO2 has not only a poi-
soning effect on the formation rate of CO, CO2, and C2 products. However, the
C2 selectivity remained unaffected. H2O in the feed enhanced the deactiva-
tion rate. This is accelerated with increasing partial pressure of H2O. Small
amounts of CO2 decreased the deactivation. The addition of liquid H2O into

the catalyst bed increased the CH4 conversion. Due to the water treatment,
it was reported that the Li content decreased and the specific surface area
increased. It was also shown that the catalyst lost Li, by deposition on the
reactor walls.
Taniewski and co-workers did research on the effective utilization of the
catalyst bed, which deactivated during the reaction (26). It was reported that a
hot-spot area was the only working region of the bed and the place of catalyst
aging. In a scaled-up laboratory reactor, it was shown that the deactivation
could be attributed to a significant loss of Li, which led to the decrease of C2
selectivity. Changing the feed inlet locations made it possible to involve suc-
cessive layers of catalyst in the reaction. Furthermore, transformations of the
bed, prepared from fresh and deactivated Li/MgO, led to the transport of Li
from the fresh catalyst (deactivation) to the deactivated catalyst (regenera-
tion). However, other researchers reported that the highly mobile Li caused
severe corrosion and loss of physical integrity in their reactors made from
different materials (21, 22).
4.2.
Comparison of Catalytic Performance of Several Li/MgO
Catalysts
In Table 1, the different reaction conditions and catalytic results taken
from different publications are presented. The applied reaction conditions vary
significantly, often a large amount of inert dilutent was applied in the feed
gas. The strong differences in the reaction conditions hinder a comparison
of results, obtained by different research groups (132); no correlation can be
observed in the obtained results due to the strong variation.
4.3.
Influence of Process Parameters
The required minimum temperature for CH4 conversion is concordantly
reported to be at approximately 600 C. The CH4 conversion and the C2 yield
increase with increasing reaction temperature, reaching a maximum at ca.
750 to 800 C. However, since some authors reported Li/MgO to be an instable
catalyst, the catalytic performance of different Li/MgO catalysts after several
hours time on stream is questionable. Studies on this subject have not been
published yet.
In 1994, Machocki showed that the OCM at temperatures below 700 C
could be applied without the loss of effectiveness, via applying a much
longer contact time. He showed that the required contact times were much
longer than previously reported in the majority of publications. Therefore,
an extended contact time could lead to lower reaction temperatures, i.e.,
600 to 650 C, even for catalysts that are regarded to be suitable for the high
temperature range (137).

Table 1: Overview of the reaction conditions and catalytic performance taken from selected publications. Usually the C2
selectivity is reported, meaning the combined selectivity towards C2H6 and C2H4. However, in few publications the C2+ selectivity,
which also takes higher hydrocarbons into account, is reported. The difference between C2 and C2+, which is usually small, has
been neglected and reported as C2. The space time yield for the C2 products (STY) was calculated according to the formula STY
= np/mcatalyst; if the catalyst was given as a volume, then this has been used.

Asami and co-workers observed that the non-catalytic oxidative coupling
of CH4 was considerably enhanced under pressures up to 16 bar and in a
temperature range between 650 and 800 C (138).
Ekstrom et al. investigated the effect of pressure (range of 16 bar) on the
OCM reaction (139). They found that with increasing pressure the importance
of the uncatalyzed reaction also increased significantly. This is in agreement
with the results of Lane and Wolf (140). The pressure dependency of the cat-
alyzed and uncatalyzed reactions were different; at high pressures and low
flow rates the uncatalyzed reactions were predominant. Moreover, they found
that at high flow rates the C2+ selectivity decreased with increasing pressure.
Pinabiau-Carlier et al. also investigated the effect of the pressure on the OCM,
but not with a Li/MgO catalyst (141).
Edwards and co-workers studied the OCM in a fixed-bed and a fluidized-
bed reactor (20). They found that increasing the pressure in the fixed-bed
reactor led to an increase in CH4 conversion, but in a reduced C2 selectivity.
Chen et al. studied the effect of pressure (up to 10 bar) on the oxida-
tive coupling of methane in the absence of a catalyst (142). The conversion
of CH4 and O2 increased with pressure at constant temperature and residence
time. Increasing pressure favored the oxidative route from C2H6 to C2H4 com-
pared to the pyrolytic route. The methyl and the hydrogen peroxy radicals were
reported to be the most abundant radicals, however, this was concluded on the
basis of a model (142, 143).
Parida and Rao found that the key factor of the OCM was a low specific
surface area, however, there should be an optimal surface area. Furthermore,
it was found that the C2 selectivity increased with an increasing basicity (144).
Iwamatsu et al. studied different alkali-doped MgO for the oxidative cou-
pling of methane (12, 13, 120). They found that a low surface area was a
very important factor for a high C2 yield. Also, other researchers found that
a low surface area was rather beneficial than detrimental for a high yield, for
instance, Lunsford et al. (85). In an investigation with a series of metal oxides
supported on SrCO3, Aika and co-workers found that a decrease in catalyst
surface led to an increase in the C2 formation, concomitantly suppressing the
total oxidation (145).
Rynkowski et al. reported on the influence of the calcination temperature
on the surface area of SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO, comparing this with the results
obtained when these oxides were promoted with Li (146). The addition of Li led
to a significant decrease in the BET surface area after calcination, compared
to the undoped sample.
Kuo et al. showed that the reduction of surface area, which is induced by
the incorporation of Li, could be compensated by addition of activated charcoal
at the start of the preparation procedure (35). The charcoal was burned off
in the calcination step. The surface area increased and the morphology was
modified. The effect of the charcoal addition could be avoiding the formation

of large MgO crystals. The conversion and selectivity of the catalysts (per unit
surface area) was found to be nearly independent of the specific surface area.
Therefore, Kuo and co-workers concluded that the effect of the BET surface
area on the activity, reported in earlier studies, was probably influenced by the
residence time and it is not a pure effect of the BET surface area. However, a
correlation was found between the CH4 conversion, the total surface area in
the reactor, and an inverse correlation between catalyst density and specific
surface area of the catalyst. The variation of the BET surface area in these
experiments was only between approximately 0.5 m2/g and 3.0 m2/g.
The results of experiments with different catalysts indicate the idea that
an optimal surface area, which is not too high, exists for the OCM (62).
However, the authors also argued that more detailed work is necessary to
substantiate this idea, as it cannot be excluded that the OCM is a structure
sensitive reaction. For such a case, a heat treatment of the catalysts would not
only lead to a reduced surface area, but also to a different surface morphology.

Summary
Deactivation of Li/MgO is due to a loss of Li as LiOH, which is formed
from Li-compounds with the reaction product H2O. Deactivation is partly sup-
pressed by CO2 transforming Li2O into the more stable Li2CO3. There seems
to be a general trend that high carbonate-containing materials are more stable
and more selective towards C2 formation than such with small carbonate con-
tent. The role of the LiOH vapor in the gas phase has not yet been investigated,
although this problem has been mentioned by Martin and Mirodatos (62).
The rate of deactivation, in particular of sintering, depends on the gas
composition around the catalyst. High CH4 conversions, and, therefore, high
partial pressures of H2O, lead to a high deactivation. High amounts of dilutent
in the feed gas seem to supress deactivation. Both are detrimental to an indus-
trial application. Supporting Li/MgO on SiO2, Al2O3, and Cr2O3 did not lead
to any significant improvement with respect to catalyst stability.
Catalyst selectivity towards C2 of Li/MgO increased by doping Li/MgO
with certain dopants like Mn, Cd, and Zn; however, activity was negatively
affected. Operating conditions and the dimensions of the reactor also influence
selectivity. Usually, temperatures in the range of 700 to 800 C lead to the best
selectivities, while at lower as well as higher temperatures, selectivity dete-
riorates due to total oxidation. High ratios of partial pressures of CH4 to O2
results in better selectivity than in the reversed case. Furthermore, the abso-
lute pressure of O2 is also a selectivity-determining factor: higher O2 partial
pressures favor total oxidation. Any excessive hotspots within the reactor as
well as transport limitations should be avoided since selectivity is negatively
affected.

At higher pressures, non-catalytic gas phase oxidation reactions can occur
leading also to some C2 formation, even though small in comparison to COx.
Even though under typical OCM conditions, mixtures are outside flammability
limits at atmospheric pressure, it cannot be excluded that gas phase reactions
also play an important role there, as radicals released of the catalyst might
initiate gas phase radical chain processes.

MECHANISTIC STUDIES
5.1.
General Mechanistic Studies
Ito et al. conducted experiments with a series of differently doped Li/MgO
catalysts. It was reported that their 7 wt% Li/MgO prepared catalyst reached
a steady state after 15 h time on stream and remained a stable performance
until the end of the experiment, 32 h time on stream (9). The reaction condi-
tions were 700 C, 1 g of catalyst, feed gas composition: CH4:O2:He = 3:1:21.3,
flow: 50 ml/min, which are typical laboratory conditions. It was proposed that
the coupling of two CH3· radicals lead to the formation of C2H6 and that C2H4
is formed via the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6. The measured EPR sig-
nals were in agreement with the ones Abraham and co-workers assigned to
[Li+O] (147), suggesting the presence of this defect. Later, the EPR technique
was used to observe the formation of methyl radicals, when CH4 was passed
over pure MgO at 500 C (10, 148). Depending on the kind of pretreatment, sig-
nificant differences in the initial activity were observed. Vacuum pretreatment
did not lead to an increase in activity, while pretreatment in O2 did increase
the initial activity, observed as an improved formation of methyl radicals. The
formation of [Li+O] centers in single crystals of MgO doped with Li at temper-
atures between 1000 to 1300 C was reported and extensively studied before
by Abraham et al. (101), Chen et al. (103), Lacey et al. (106), Boldu et al. (107),
Olson et al. (108), Chen et al. (109), and Abraham et al. (147). It was shown
that these centers also formed at temperatures between 5001000 C in an O2
atmosphere, even if the intensity differed (10).
Yates and Zlotin observed that the uncatalyzed thermal reaction, in an
empty reactor, contributed significantly to the oxidative coupling of methane
(149). The results obtained at 700 and 720 C are shown in Table 2. It is evident
that in the applied reactor system, the blank reaction contributed significantly
to the CH4 conversion, however, the total oxidation was dominant. Moreover,
the main contribution of the catalysts was the oxidation of CO to CO2. Only
Li/MgO showed an increase in C2H4 selectivity. Ito and Lunsford et al. (8),
Ito et al. (9), and Liu et al. (150) had reported in their earlier studies that only
0.2% conversion in the blanc reactor were observed. Yates and Zlotin explained
the difference to their observed values with a difference in the reactor geom-
etry (149). Remarkably, the obtained values for the reactor with catalysts did

not differ so significantly. The authors concluded that the function of Li/MgO
in the OCM is extremely complex and that homogeneous and heterogeneous
reaction is important.
In the ensuing discussion, Hatano and co-workers argued that the varia-
tions in the results could be explained with differences in residence time (151).
The residence time in the experiments of Ito and Lunsford et al. (8), Ito et al.
(9), and Liu et al. (150) was shown to be less than 5 sec, whereas the set-up
of Yates and Zlotin had a residence of above 20 sec (149). Furthermore, it was
emphasized that the extent of the homogeneous reactions was also strongly
influenced by the free volume, a factor which was also different in the works
of Lunsford and Yates. Different CH4 conversions were reported in case of
an empty reactor or a reactor filled with fused-quartz rings and the ques-
tion was raised, why Yates and Zlotin (149), but also Lane and Wolf (140), did
not observe differences for such experiments. Regarding the O2 conversion, it
was argued that under the conditions Yates and Zlotin applied, most of the O2
had already been consumed before reaching the catalyst bed. Lunsford and co-
workers concluded summarizingly, that in their experiments the homogeneous
contribution was not significant and that it seemed unlikely that C2 yield could
be achieved purely by homogeneous reactions (151).
Yates and Zlotin (152) replied that they published a Li2B4O7, which did
not have any combustion activity and, therefore, did not produce significantly
more CO2 than the empty reactor (153). It was critized that Lunsford and co-
workers did not cite this work. They also argued that the O2 conversion in their
work and that of Lunsford did not differ as significantly as argued by Lunsford,
since the same reaction conditions were applied. This debate shows that sev-
eral research groups can obtain different results, alone due to differences in the
reactor set-up. Further detailed experiments under controlled and comparable
conditions will be necessary to unreveal structure activity correlations.
It is reported that the contribution of the gas phase depends on the
exact operating conditions (partial pressures of all compounds, temperature,

residence time, and free reactor volume) (154). Yates and Zlotin and other
researchers did observe significant contributions of gas phase reactions for the
OCM. Therefore, it can be concluded that Lunsford et al. underestimated the
importance of gas phase reactions, maybe due to their small scale experimental
set-up and the applied reaction conditions.
Hutchings and co-workers studied the partial oxidation of CH4 at 5.85 kPa
at higher temperatures, ca. 700800 C with and without the presence of a cat-
alyst (155). The product yields were similar in the presence and absence of the
catalyst, which indicated that a suitable catalyst is of secondary importance at
this temperature, in agreement with the results of Yates and Zlotin (149).
Hutchings et al. compared the selectivities of Li/MgO and MgO in order
to study the role of Li. Since Li/MgO showed higher selectivities for C2H6,
they assumed that the role of Li could be the inhibition of the oxidative
dehydrogenation activity of the MgO (156).
Korf and co-workers showed that the active sites were formed as a result
of the loss of carbonate species and that they were unstable under the reaction
conditions of the OCM, namely reducing conditions. Catalysts with a high con-
centration of carbonate species produced more C2 products than catalysts with
a lower concentration of these species. Because calcination at lower tempera-
tures led to a higher residual CO2 content of the catalysts, it also led to a higher
catalytic activity. Furthermore, the formation of the active sites was suggested
to be a direct result of the loss of carbonate species, which were unstable under
the reaction conditions of the OCM, namely reducing conditions (28).
Roos and co-workers investigated the reaction pathway of the OCM over
Li/MgO (157). A recycle system was applied that behaves like a gradientless
reactor with respect to the gas phase concentrations; a description can be found
in (158). It was found that at 720 C the reaction followed a sequential reaction
scheme, as shown in Reaction 5. Furthermore, they found that the presence of
alkali carbonates and an excess of CH4 decelerated the total oxidation of C2H6
and C2H4.

Van Kasteren and co-workers investigated the nature of the active com-
pound of Li/MgO via comparison of the activity and the deactivation of Li/MgO
catalysts and Li2CO3 supported on ZrO2 (123). The O2 conversion of their
7 wt% Li/MgO increased during the first 16 h, nearly to full conversion, fol-
lowed by a steady deactivation. It was also shown that the Li content decreased
during the whole time on stream. For 0.2 wt% Li/MgO, deactivation and loss
of Li were observed from the beginning. However, the initial values of con-
version were the same for both catalysts. It was concluded that only a small
amount of the Li was responsible for the activity. Li2CO3 alone supported on
the inert carrier ZrO2 revealed that Li2CO3 was also an active OCM catalyst,

Figure 5: The working hypothesis of the Li/MgO catalysts, as proposed by van der Wiele et al.
In the presence of O2, Li2CO3 decomposes to form the active site, which reacts with CH4. The
deactivation proceeds through evaporation, reaction with H2O to LiOH, or the formation of
Li2SiO3, reaction with SiO2 from the quartz of the reactor material, which is being almost inert.

with a performance identical to Li/MgO, except for lower activity due to the
lower specific surface area. The activity lasted as long as Li2CO3 was present.
It was shown that Li2ZrO3, which was also an active catalyst, was not the
active phase here, as it was not present. From this information, a working
hypothesis of Li/MgO was developed, as shown in Figure 5. These results are
in agreement with results published by Mirodatos and co-workers (119, 122).
Lunsford and co-workers studied the Reaction 6 over (LiCl+NaCl)/MgO
(159). With a matrix isolation system, methyl radicals were observed.
CH4 + C2H4 C3H6

However, vinyl radicals could not be detected. With isotopic experiments it was
shown that the methyl group, which was added to the alkene, was derived from
the CH4.
Chen et al. studied the OCM with a co-feed of C2H6 in the presence and
absence of Li/Sn/MgO as catalyst (19). They found an increase in the feed con-
version in the absence of catalyst. It was concluded that this was due to an
increase in the concentration of radicals. Co-feeding in the presence of the cat-
alysts resulted in a small increase in O2 conversion and a decrease in the CH4
conversion. The later one probably occurred due to a competition with C2H6 for
the active site. The rate determining step was determined to be the regenera-
tion of the active center. However, a beneficial effect of co-feeding C2H6 in the
presence of the catalyst was not found. Based on this result, it was concluded
that for the upgrade of natural gas the C2H6 should be separated beforehand.
Many of the above-described results were obtained by steady state exper-
iments. However, transient experiments can also significantly contribute to a
mechanistic understanding of a reaction. Many of the results in the follow-
ing paragraphs and sections were obtained by transient experiments. In an

excellent review article from Schuurman and Mirodatos, the use of transient
kinetic experiments for methane activation, including the OCM, has been
summarized and discussed (160).
5.2.
Reactant Activation
5.2.1.
Oxygen Activation
Nibbelke et al. showed that O2 interacts strongly with the catalyst.
It reversibly adsorbed dissociatively and an exchange between the surface and
the bulk oxygen took place (161). Doping with Li, even more with Sn, increased
the oxygen diffusion coefficient, therefore, increasing the exchangeable amount
of oxygen on the catalyst. CO2 interacted with the catalyst, in the absence of
the reactants, only in the presence of Li.
Peil and co-workers used steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analy-
sis (SSITKA) to investigate surface phenomena in the OCM over MgO and
Li/MgO at temperatures up to 645 C (162164). They found that the MgO
and the Li/MgO catalysts could be divided into three regions:
1.
physical surface where the oxygen exchange between gas phase and solid
phase takes place,
2.
several layers of subsurface oxygen atoms that are readily available for
exchanges, and
3.
the bulk oxide.
The subsurface oxygen and the bulk oxygen were significant additional oxy-
gen sources. The investigation of the pathway of CO2 suggested a multi-step
oxidation pathway. Active sites that were involved in the coupling process
were found to have a lower activity than active sites involved in the selective
processes (162164).
Dahl et al. conducted characterization studies of Li/MgO in a pulse reac-
tor, exposing the catalyst to pulses of air, CH4, and air-CH4 mixtures (165).
The results indicated that the catalyst was active even with small amounts of
Li2CO3, and O2 may reversibly adsorb on the surface. Additionally, Li/MgO
could act as an oxygen reservoir.
Contradictory results to Peil and Nibbelke have been published by
Choudhary et al. (166). With pulse of CH4, C2H6, and C2H4 in the presence
and absence of gas phase O2 over Li-, La-, and Sm-promoted MgO, it was shown
that the lattice oxygen of these catalysts did not have a significant role in the
OCM and the presence of free O2 is necessary for the OCM. The lattice oxygen
is involved in the conversion of C2H6 and C2H4, however, the importance for
the oxidation of C2H4 seemed to be more significant than for the oxidation of

Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 457
C2H6. Similar results were found for Li/MgO with additives (87) and for the
oxidation of C2H4 over Li/MgO (89).
Keulks and co-workers studied the oxygen species with temperature pro-
grammed reactions in the oxidative coupling of methane over various catalysts,
among them: Li/MgO (167). Their results suggested that simple adsorbed oxy-
gen species were not active for coupling, but for total oxidation. For simple
oxide catalysts, such as Li/MgO, gas phase O2 was necessary for the generation
of the oxygen species active for the coupling reaction. Nevertheless, for multi-
component catalysts, the lattice oxygen regenerates the active oxygen species.
The results of Bhumkar and Lobban also suggested that gas phase O2 was
involved in the regeneration of the active sites and in the CO2 formation (168).
5.2.2.
Alternative Oxygen Sources
Nakamura and co-workers studied the decomposition of N2O on Li/MgO
investigating the adsorbed oxygen species being formed (169). It was demon-
strated that a substantial amount of adsorbed oxygen species were formed.
Moreover, the formed amount increased by doping MgO with Li. Experiments
with molecular oxygen resulted in a much lower formation of adsorbed oxy-
gen species. TPD experiments revealed two types of adsorbed oxygen species
on Li/MgO, the α-species desorbing between 400420 C and the β-species at
480495 C. In contrast, for pure MgO only a weak α-oxygen species was found.
It was suggested that the α-oxygen species was present on higher index faces
of MgO, whereas the β-oxygen species was present at oxygen vacancies in the
neighborhood of places where Li substituted Mg. The hydrolysis of the oxygen
species, by soaking the samples in a solution of H2SO4, resulted in consider-
able amounts of H2O2, suggesting that they were mainly present as surface
peroxides.
The use of different oxygen sources for the oxidative coupling of methane
has been reviewed by Hutchings et al. (170, 171). Only publications that refer
to Li/MgO as a catalyst will be discussed in detail here.
Hutchings and co-workers investigated the role of surface Oin the selec-
tive oxidation of CH4 using N2O as oxygen source (135, 172). They showed that
O
(s) has two roles:
1.
at low temperatures: hydrogen abstraction
2.
at high temperatures: non-selective oxidation
Using O2 as an oxygen source, the CH4 conversion was an order of magnitude
higher than with N2O. However, at comparable conversions, N2O led to higher
selectivities than O2.
In contrast to this, while studying the decomposition of N2O and the activa-
tion of CH4 with O2 and N2O over Li/MgO and MgO doped with alkaline earth

458 S. Arndt et al.
oxides, Cunningham and McNamara found that O2 was the more effective oxy-
gen source; generally resulting in higher conversion and higher selectivities
(173).
Later, Hutchings et al. studied the OCM over Li/MgO in the presence of
NO (174). They found that in the presence of NO, Li/MgO showed at least
two different oxidizing species or oxidizing sites, which were significant. In the
OCM over MgO and Li/MgO in the presence of different nitric oxides, different
trends were observed for these two catalysts, therefore, indicating different
reaction mechanisms for MgO and Li/MgO (175).
In 1988, the same group did a comparative study of O2, O3, and N2O as
oxygen source for the OCM over Li/MgO, MgO, and γ -Al2O3 (128, 176). Below
400 C, O3 was more active and selective than O2. The products under these
conditions were only H2, CO2, and CO. H2O could not be detected. The addition
of H2O did not affect the product selectivity. O2 and O3 showed a similar per-
formance at higher temperatures, while at low temperatures (200300 C) O3
showed higher performance. Nitrous oxides appeared to enhance the partial
oxidation at low temperatures (550 C), while at higher temperatures (720 C),
it increased the formation of total oxidation products. However, deactivation of
the catalyst was observed.
The kinetic isotope effect during the oxidative coupling of methane over
Li/MgO was studied by Shi and co-workers (177). When using O2 as the oxygen
source, it was found that a single rate limiting step did not exist. For N2O, the
rate limiting step was the incorporation of the oxygen into the crystal lattice
of the Li/MgO.
Yamamoto et al. studied the OCM over Li/MgO with N2O as the oxygen
source (178). The rate of oxygen incorporation into the catalyst was slower
with N2O than with O2. However, at the same CH4 conversion levels, N2O
led to higher selectivities than O2, probably due to a decrease of surface reac-
tions, which led to COx. Applying N2O as oxidant, pure MgO exhibits a much
higher CH4 conversion in comparison to Li/MgO, however, its C2 selectivity
was rather low.
5.2.3.
Methane Activation
Davydov et al. investigated the character of the primary CH4 activation on
MgO (179). They observed that the CH4 activation on MgO formed CH3 groups.
The effect of CO2 on the selectivity of OCM and ODH of C2H6 over Li/MgO
at temperatures below 650 C was investigated by Wang and co-workers. It was
found that secondary reactions of the methyl radicals on the catalyst surface
are inhibited by CO2 (180). In this publication, it was also commented that
Korf et al. did not observe an effect of CO2 on the C2 selectivity (28). The reason
could be that the reaction temperature in Korfs experiments was 780800 C
and the selectivity of 78%, was already high. The main source of CO2 at this

Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 459
temperature was the total oxidation of C2H6 and C2H4 in the gas phase (181).
Thus, the importance of surface phenomena, like secondary reactions of the
methyl radicals, decreased, however, the formation of methyl radical still took
place (180).
The effect of CO2 on the activation energy for the CH3· formation and the
overall CH4 consumption in the OCM over Li/MgO was investigated by Xu
et al. [182]. They found that in the gas phase, CO2 increased the intrinsic acti-
vation energy for the CH3· formation by 100% with increasing partial pressure
of CO2. The activation energy approached a limiting value of 209 kJ/mol at
CO2 partial pressures higher than 0.001 bar, a value which is definitely being
achieved under typical reaction conditions for the OCM. CO2 acted as a cata-
lyst poison, because it adsorbed at the basic oxygen ions, which were believed
to be responsible for the activation of CH4. At lower temperatures, more active
sites were poisoned than at higher temperatures.
Coulter and Goodman showed that the rate-limiting step of the OCM
depended on the CO2 coverage of the catalyst. Their results indicated that
at low partial pressures of CO2, the C-H bond cleavage is the rate determining
step, while at high partial pressures of CO2 the desorption of CO2 is the rate
determining step (183).
Cant et al. observed that the rate of conversion of CH4 over Li/MgO is
1.5 times larger than the rate of CD4, indicating that the C-H bond breaking is
the rate determining step (184). The influence of a possible rearrangement of
OH, respectively, OD sites on the catalyst were excluded via experiments with
D2O addition.
Lapszewicz and Jiang studied the relationship between activity, selectivity,
and basicity and the ability of C-H and O-O bond scission of γ -Al2O3, MgO and
monoclinic or cubic Sm2O3 (185). Isotopic exchange rates were measured to
determine the ability of these materials to activate the reactants of the OCM.
Since a correlation was not found, it was concluded that the formation of the
methyl radical cannot be explained simply by a one-step mechanism.
5.3.
Reaction Network
5.3.1.
Reaction Intermediates
Bhumkar and Lobban observed in situ the surface features of Li/MgO
and its interactions with adsorbates at steady state and transient conditions,
applying diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS)
(168). Under reaction conditions, adsorbed CO2 strongly bonded to OH groups
and carbonate was found. CO2 in the gas phase reduced the catalytic activ-
ity due to adsorption and reaction to carbonate. However, H2O had a positive
effect on the carbonate decomposition.

460 S. Arndt et al.
The presence of carbene during the OCM reaction was shown by Martin
and Mirodatos (186). They introduced C2H4 into the reactor, which was
transformed into cyclopropane. Later this was confuted by Mims and co-
workers (187).
Martin et al. studied the heterogeneous and homogeneous processes
involved in the OCM over Li/MgO (188). They compared the conversion,
selectivities, and yields of CH4/O2 and C2H6/O2 mixtures. The observed dif-
ferences were likely to be due to the much shorter lifetime of the C2H5·
radical, preventing subsequent heterogeneous deep oxidation. CH4 mixed with
other hydrocarbons led to cross coupling products, if the C-H bond strength
is relatively small (for example propene and toluene in contrast to benzene).
Cross-coupling of CH4 and C2H4 was also observed by Lunsford et al. (159).
Nibbelke et al. investigated the heterogeneous steps of the OCM over
Li/MgO and Li/Sn/MgO. As mentioned above, for a fully satisfying explana-
tion of the obtained results, a methoxy species was postulated, which was the
only carbon containing intermediate leading to the formation of CO2 (161).
5.3.2.
Product Formation
Geerts and co-workers investigated the individual reaction steps in the
oxidative coupling of methane over Li/MgO, studying the oxidation of C2H6,
C2H4, and CO separately (189). It was found, that the conversion of C2H6 to
C2H4 was faster than the total oxidation of C2H6, irrespective of the catalyst.
The conversion of C2H6 proceeded much faster than the conversion of CH4. The
combustion proceeds mainly via C2H4, which would be a serious constraint for
the maximal achievable yield.
Campbell and Lunsford investigated the contribution of the gas phase
radical coupling in the oxidative coupling of methane. They found a good agree-
ment between the yield and the methyl radical formation. The CO2 partial
pressure was also found to be an important variable (190).
Van Kasteren et al. used low pressure experiments to discriminate
between the homogeneous and the heterogeneous reactions (191). The Li/MgO
in the OCM was proposed to activate CH4 and to produce methyl radicals,
which couple in the gas phase, in case a sufficient amount of third bodies are
available. Furthermore, it was shown that Li/MgO was involved in the total
oxidation of C2H6, C2H4, and CO.
This is in agreement with the work of Campbell et al. (192), concluding that
at least 4045% of the C2 molecules were the product of gas phase coupling.
That no significant hydrogen exchange was observed, indicates that the C-H
breaking is an irreversible step.
In studies of the OCM with Li/MgO with a reactant mixture of CH4, CD4,
and O2 (193195), no significant hydrogen exchange between CH4 and CD4
was detected. The only detected reaction products were:

b. CH3CD3
c. C2D6
2.
Unsaturated products:
a. C2H4
b. CH2CD2
c. C2D4.
Depending on the concentration of the reactants, the relative concentra-
tion of the different products could be predicted. Based on these results, it
was proposed that the formation of C2H6 occurred via the gas phase cou-
pling of methyl radicals, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the
gas phase was the source of C2H4. However, the absence of hydrogen exchange
is remarkable, because over pure MgO it has been reported to take place for C2
hydrocarbons at 300 C and for CH4 at 400 C (196), and the activation energy
was determined to be 193 kJ/mol  14 kJ/mol (197). Even so, taking place at
elevated temperatures, other researchers also reported the exchange between
CH4 and D2 over MgO (185, 198). Balint and Aika could observe an isotopic
exchange between CD4 and the hydroxyl groups of the 1 wt% Li/MgO at room
temperature (199).
Mims et al. also investigated the oxidative coupling of methane with
CH4/CD4 mixtures (187). The results were in agreement with Nelson et al.
(193195). The OCM reaction mechanism via methylene, which was proposed
by Martin and Mirodatos (186), could be excluded, because the only products
formed are C2H6, CH3CD3, and C2D6.
A close relationship between the formation rate of C2H6 per unit surface
area and the density of strong basic sites on the surface was observed by
Choudhary et al. (16).
Hargreaves et al. observed at low O2 conversions (10%) high selectivities

products.
However, at an O2 conversion of approximately 10%, a selectivity switch
was observed. The selectivity towards H2CO was negligible, while the C2
approached 30%. The presence of H2 was also observed, despite incomplete O2
conversion (200).
5.3.3.
Consecutive Reaction: Ethane to Ethylene
C2H6 is the primary C2 product in OCM, but already below the tempera-
ture required for the C2H6 formation the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6
to C2H4 proceeds. Therefore, it is important not only to consider the coupling

462 S. Arndt et al.
of methyl radicals to C2H6, but also the ODH of C2H6, to produce the desired
product C2H6.
Morales and Lunsford reported that 3 wt% Li/MgO was an effective cat-
alyst for the ODH of C2H6 (181). They also showed that COx species were
produced from the total oxidation of C2H6 as well as C2H4. They could fur-
ther show that above temperatures of 675 C the gas phase reactions became
predominant. It was assumed that even the ODH of C2H6 reaction involved
the generation of radicals, C2H5· radicals in case of the ODH of C2H6.
Chevalier and co-workers also observed that under reaction conditions of
the OCM (800 C), C2H6 was non-oxidatively dehydrogenated to C2H4 (42).
The importance of consecutive reactions was studied over the Li/MgO cat-
alyst by van Kasteren et al. (201). The experiments were carried out at low
pressures (0.00010.015 bar). It was found that C2H6 was converted 4 times
faster than CH4, mostly to C2H4. C2H4 was still oxidized 2.6 times faster than
CH4. The conclusion was that there should be an upper limit of the C2+ yield,
which can be achieved with Li/MgO.
5.3.4.
Consecutive Reaction: Total Oxidation
Reviewing the study of the single steps of the OCM reactions, Geerts et al.
found that the main reaction pathway for the combustion proceeded via C2H4
(189). In the absence of a catalyst, the main combustion product was CO, while
in the presence of a catalyst, CO2 dominated. Similar results were observed by
Mirodatos and co-workers. C2H6 was oxidized to CO already at 600 C in the
gas phase. At this temperature, the oxidative coupling was still very limited.
This was identified as one of the biggest problems of the oxidative coupling of
methane (202).
Roos and co-workers also compared the reaction pathways of C2H6 and
C2H4 over Li/MgO and Ca/Sm2O3 (203). None of the molecules were found
to be stable under reaction conditions. The total oxidation of C2H6 and C2H4
contributed significantly to the overall reaction network. Since Ca/Sm2O3 was
the most active catalyst, its total oxidation activity for C2H6 and C2H4 was at
least partially responsible for its lower selectivity compared to Li/MgO.
Nelson and co-workers and Cant and co-workers studied the kinetic iso-
tope effect and the contribution of the oxidation of the C2 products to the CO2
formation with isotopic tracer experiments over Li/MgO with isotopic reac-
tant mixtures (184, 193195, 204, 205). They could show that above 740 C
3080% of the CO2 derived from the oxidation of the C2 hydrocarbons, while
below 700 C, were responsible for less than 10% of the CO2 formation. Two
pathways for the C2 oxidation were possible:
1.
competition of the C2 products with CH4 for O2 in surface promoted
reaction, and
2.
competition for CH3· by abstraction and combination, leading to the
formation of COx.

Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 463
Furthermore, their experiments showed that an exchangeable pool of CO2
existed in the catalyst, indicating that Li2CO3 is present during the reac-
tion. Besides, it was also found that the first step of activation was the bond
breaking of a C-H bond.
In 1994, Mims and co-workers traced the secondary reactions of C2H4 with
computer models and isotopic experiments (206). The oxidation of C2H4 had
only little effects on the CH4 conversion, even at comparable partial pressures.
From the comparison with computer models, the surface was seen to quantita-
tively quench much of the oxidative gas phase radical chemistry. The C3 and C4
yield and the isotopic distributions agreed well with the described gas phase
pathways.
The origin of CO2 in the OCM was investigated with isotope experiments
by Shi et al. (207). The results showed that the rate of COx formation from
C2 products was several times larger than the COx formation from CH4, even
for Li/MgO at temperatures below 700 C. The rate constants for the forma-
tion of COx from CH4 and from C2H4 depended on several factors like type of
catalyst, reaction temperature, CH4 to O2 ratio, and type of oxidant. Under
the studied reaction conditions, the ratio of COx formed from CH4 and from
C2H4, the C2 selectivity and the C2 yield tended to increase with increasing
temperature. This suggested that the amount of CH4 being converted to COx
decreased.

Consecutive Reaction: Formation of Hydrogen, Reforming, and Water
Gas Shift Reaction
Hargreaves and co-wokers studied the formation of H2 in the OCM over
MgO (208). H2 had an unexpectedly high selectivity in the OCM reaction. The
source was the water gas shift reaction but also thermal cracking of C2H6.
However, the partial oxidation became more dominant at higher flow rates
and low oxygen conversions.
Kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the ODH of C2H6 on Li/MgO were stud-
ied by Swaan et al. (209). The results indicated that H2 and CO are unlikely
to be the product of steam reforming, CO2 reforming of C2H6, or the water gas
shift reaction. H2 and CO are most likely produced by the decomposition of
ethoxy species on the surface.
Balint and Aika investigated the water gas shift reaction and the methane
steam reforming over 1% Li/MgO with temperature programmed reactions
and isotope labeled compounds (199). The experimental results suggested, that
the contribution of water gas shift reaction to the amounts of CO2 and H2
formed in the oxidative coupling of methane was important, which is in con-
tradiction to the results of Swaan et al. (209). Steam reforming of methane
could not be observed. However, an isotopic exchange between CD4 and the
OH groups of the Li/MgO was observed at room temperature.

Debate About the Active Center
5.4.1.
Defect Sites with Lithium and Oxygen
In their EPR experiments, Lunsford et al. found an EPR signal, which
was in agreement with the signal Abraham et al. assigned to [Li+O] (147).
The methyl radical formation was correlated with the relative intensity of
EPR signals, which were assigned to the concentration of the [Li+O] centers,
shown in Figure 6. Depending on this correlation it was concluded that the
active center is [Li+O] (10). They suggest that methyl radicals are formed
via a hydrogen abstraction from CH4 by the [Li+O] centers. The mechanism
proposed by Lunsford et al. is shown in Figure 7. An alternative pathway for
the regeneration may also be possible, with an electron trapped in an oxygen
ion vacancy (9).
However, no direct proof, e.g., by ENDOR, was given that the observed
signal at g = 2.054 was indeed caused by [Li+O]. Furthermore, the signal was
never detected directly upon quenching from OCM conditions but only upon
quenching after heating in air or pure O2. It is, therefore, highly questionable
whether the correlation observed in Figure 7 is indicative of the mechanism
suggested by Lunsford et al.

Figure 7: The mechanism of the CH4 activation over Li/MgO and the regeneration of the
active center as proposed by Lunsford and co-workers.
In 1986, the [Li+O] centers in Li/MgO were characterized by Wang and
Lunsford (210). They found indications that these centers were formed at iso-
lated substitutional Li+ ions. These defects were believed to be responsible
for the activation of CH4. Later, Lunsford slightly modified his suggestion to
Oδor O
3 to take into account that the CH4 activation is rate limiting for the
OCM, whereas the activation by Owas shown to be relatively rapid at low
temperatures (85).
Peng and co-workers investigated the surface composition and the reac-
tivity of Li/MgO with kinetic and XPS measurements (134). Under reaction
conditions, they observed two Li containing phases in Li/MgO, namely [Li+O]
and Li2CO3. The O(1s) XPS peaks were assigned to the surface [Li+O] and its
concentration. Due to the correlation of the CH4 conversion and the concen-
tration of surface [Li+O], it was demonstrated that the [Li+O] species is the
active center. Moreover, they determined that the concentration of the [Li+O]
species seemed to be saturated at a Li loading of 0.2 wt%. They presumed that
Li in excess to this, evaporated from the surface and/or diffused into the MgO.
This value is in agreement with the discussion on the optimal loading of Li
(78) and the experiments for the re-appraisal of the Li loading of Hutchings
and co-workers (79).
However, Myrach et al. could not detect EPR signal compatible with
[Li+O] (118).
5.4.2.
F-Center
Wu et al. investigated the OCM over model catalysts of MgO and Li/MgO
with combined surface science techniques under ultra high vacuum (UHV)
conditions and kinetic measurements at elevated pressures. Their results indi-
cated that the [Li+O] centers were not responsible for the activation of CH4,
but in fact the formation of F-type centers in the near surface region (211214).
The formation of C2H6 could be correlated with the F-type defects, determined
by spectroscopic methods (213, 215). The effect of the pretreatment on the

active site of MgO and Li/MgO was also investigated (216). The C2 prod-
uct formation over MgO increased with increasing pretreatment temperature
indicating that the active site for the CH4 activation was most probably an
F-type defect. This was in agreement with the thin film model (215). The for-
mation of these defects was postulated as the rate determining step. However,
for Li/MgO the rate determining step depended on the reactant gas mixture,
namely whether O2 was present or absent. Li is considered to be a promoter
for the F-type defects, which could explain that in Li/MgO the rate determin-
ing step was different compared to MgO. It was suggested that in the presence
of O2, the decomposition of Li2CO3 was the rate determining step and in the
absence of O2 it was the H abstraction from CH4 (216).
Nelson and Tench studied the chemisorption of O2 on MgO. The experi-
ments showed that in an O2 atmosphere, the F-centers disappeared at 350 C
(217). However, statistical thermodynamics predict that at higher tempera-
tures, more F-centers should be formed. If the F-centers are stable under OCM,
conditions are unknown.
5.4.3.
Mobile Lithium Carbonate Film
The deactivation of the Li/MgO catalysts was investigated in detail by
Mirodatos and co-workers (119). It was found that a tight interface between
Li2CO3 and MgO phases enabled an optimal catalytic performance. This was
the case after a treatment, which allowed the liquefaction of the alkali salt.
However, the static model of Li substitution, proposed by Ito et al. (9), Driscoll
et al. (10), and Lin and co-workers (218), does not agree exactly with the model
of the mobile Li2CO3-film coating the MgO (119). The role and the fate of
the surface active site of Li/MgO was also studied (122). Uncarbonated MgO
was reported to have a very poor activity for coupling and total oxidation.
However, for Li/MgO, the total oxidation activity was reported to depend on
the accessible surface area of Li2CO3, and the coupling activity was suggested
to require an association of Li and Mg phases being enhanced after high tem-
perature treatment. Under reaction conditions, the total oxidation selectivity
was reported to decrease, due to the decomposition of Li2CO3.
5.5.
Pure MgO
Aika and Lunsford investigated the dehydrogenation of alkanes by Oon
MgO, with EPR and catalytic experiments (219). The formation of alkenes was
observed at 25 C, the maximum was reached at 300 C. For the reaction with
alkanes, an alkoxide intermediate was proposed. For CH4, a methoxide group
was proposed, which decomposed at 450 C, to form mainly H2.
Iwamoto and Lunsford studied the oxidation of alkanes and alkenes by O
2
on MgO, using EPR and catalytic experiments (220). Stochiometric reactions
were observed with simple hydrocarbons at 175 C, resulting in oxygenates,

hydrocarbons, and CO2. It was proposed that the first step for the reaction
of hydrocarbons with O
2 is the abstraction of a hydrogen atom. Garrone and
co-workers discussed in a note the formation of O
2 on MgO in more detail
(221).
Takita and Lunsford investigated the oxidation of alkanes by O
3 on MgO,
using EPR and catalytic experiments (222). The evidence suggested a direct
reaction of the O
3 with the hydrocarbons, rather than a dissociation of the O
3
with subsequent reaction.
Ito et al. observed the activation of CH4 on MgO at lower temperatures
by means of TPD and ESR (electron spin resonance) experiments (223). It was
found that the C-H bond was easily activated on the MgO surface, even below
room temperature. Furthermore, the nature of the active site was discussed
and it was shown that on MgO in low coordinated states the CH4 adsorbs in
the heterolytically dissociated state.
Hargreaves and co-workers reported the structural effects of the oxida-
tive coupling of methane on two samples of MgO (80). MgO obtained via the
thermal decomposition of carbonates was found to show higher C2 selectivities
than MgO obtained via burning Mg. The two MgO samples had different mor-
phologies, which demonstrated that the morphology of MgO was an important
factor for the OCM.
Zhen et al. characterized and studied the catalytic properties of MgO
obtained from different preparation procedures (224). The used MgO mate-
rials were pure commercial MgO prepared via decomposition of MgCO3 and
the decomposition of Mg(NO3)2. The structural data and the catalytic perfor-
mance were correlated and the important factors for the catalytic performance,
namely temperature and specific surface area, were discussed.
Aika and Karasuda scrutinized MgO and its active site (225227). It was
proposed that the active site in MgO was an electron-deficient oxygen source,
Ofor instance (225). Oxygen exchange experiments confirmed this (226).
Later, they proposed that the adsorption of H2O could be responsible for the
generation of the active site (227). Figure 8 shows a model for the flux of oxygen
atoms for different types of oxygen in MgO-based catalysts.
Hutchings and co-workers studied the oxidative coupling of methane in
the presence of nitric oxides over MgO and Li/MgO (175). Since different
trends for these two catalysts were observed, it was suggested that the reaction
mechanism for the OCM over MgO and Li/MgO is different.

conditions followed by rapid thermal quenching. The need of oxidizing con-
ditions for the formation of these [Li+O] defects can be easily rationalized by
writing down the formation equation in the Krger Vink notation (see Reaction
7). Due to the monovalent nature of Li+ compared to Mg2+, excess gas phase
O2 is required for charge compensation.

As a matter of fact, the EPR signal at g = 2.054 (9, 10, 210), that Lunsford
attributed to [Li+O] according to the work of Abraham et al. was only
observed when the Li/MgO catalysts were calcined for an extended period of
time in air or O2 followed by quenching in liquid O2 or liquid N2. Typical OCM
conditions, on the other hand, are very reducing (CH4/O2 between 4 and 20,
H2 as reaction product) and indeed, a detection of the signal at g = 2.054 after
quenching from reaction conditions was never reported. Furthermore, it was
never proven, e.g., by ENDOR, that the paramagnetic center at g = 2.054 is
really neighbored by a Li ion.
Also the apparent correlation between the amount of CH3· radicals formed
under OCM reaction conditions over Li/MgO materials and the concentration
of [Li+O] centers measured after post-reaction calcination for 2 h at 700 C in
air followed by quenching in liquid N2 (Fig. 6) does not prove that CH3· radicals
are being formed at these centers and released in the gas phase. At OCM tem-
peratures, no catalyst is required for OCM at all as C2H6 and C2H4 are already
formed in significant amounts in an empty reactor tube as shown, for example,
by Yates and Zlotin (Table 2). Therefore, it is not surprising that CH3· radicals
can be detected at the end of a glowing reactor tube by a technique as sensitive
as EPR. Even though there is no doubt that Li/MgO and also other materials
Downloaded by [University of Wyoming Libraries] at 01:49 27 September 2013 
Li/MgO-Based Catalysts in the OCM 469
catalyzing OCM improve C2 selectivity compared to pure gas phase chemistry
(Table 2) the question remains how the catalyst does that. Several scenarios
can be considered whether the reviewed material can prove or disprove one or
the other:
1.
Reactions occur in the gas phase (via radicals) and at the surface of the
catalyst and both networks are coupled by the usual transport of species
and heat. In this case, any solid surface (catalyst, support, reactor wall,
etc.) can quench radicals from the gas phase possibly suppressing unselec-
tive oxidation pathways leading to the observed increase in C2 selectivity
as compared to undisturbed gas phase chemistry (Table 2).
2.
Radicals are actively produced at the catalyst surface and released in the
gas phase where they participate in gas phase radical chain reactions.
In this case, the catalyst would act as sort of an initiator of gas phase
radical reactions. The released radicals must not necessarily be CH3·, but
could also be OH· or other reactive species.
3.
Coupling to C2 occurs primarily at the catalyst surface followed by deep
oxidation either at the surface or in the gas phase.
4.
The catalyst dehydrogenates the primary reaction product C2H6 regard-
less of whether it is formed in the gas phase or at the catalyst surface
effectively to C2H4, which is less prone to further oxidation to COx.
From their non-steady state experiments, Dahl (165) and Choudhary (166)
consistently reported that lattice oxygen from the catalyst contributes to the
conversion of CH4. This fact is in contradiction to the discussed F-centers and
the mobile Li2CO3 film. However, it was not unambiguously proven that the
oxygen does derive from the bulk. Furthermore, it generally remains unclear
how these results can be related to other mechanistic assumptions.
Isotope labeling experiments with CH4/CD4 mixtures conducted by Mims
et al. and others and the exclusive observation of symmetrically labeled C2
products, point indeed to CH3· radicals as precursors for C2 formation while
the carbene mechanism as suggested by Martin and Mirodatos did not find
any further experimental or theoretical substantiation. The positive kinetic
isotope effect reported by Cant et al. points to cleavage of the first C-H bond
as rate limiting step. Again, taking into account that only symmetrically sub-
stituted C2 products were observed by Mims et al. and others, this first C-H
bond breaking step seems to be irreversible, whereas other publications report
an easy H,D scrambling on MgO. The only way to combine these conflicting
results is that the first C-H breaking occurs in the gas phase and not at the
surface of Li/MgO. Attributing most of the OCM chemistry to reactions in the
gas phase could explain also why hundreds of chemically different materials

catalyze OCM with similar performance at temperatures of 750 C but not why
Li/MgO and other materials enhance C2 selectivity.

Effect of Metal Oxides on Li/MgO
Li/MgO has been treated with different dopants; a general overview is
shown in Table 3. The main idea of doping Li/MgO was to prevent the loss of Li,
either by modification of the solid phase or by change the reaction conditions
towards milder conditions.
In an earlier study, Bi et al. investigated the OCM reaction over a series
of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides, prepared by an impreg-
nation method. SiO2, Al2O3, and several different MgO materials were used
as support material. MgO was found to be the most promising support and
Li/Ce/MgO to be the most promising catalyst (136).
Korf et al. observed the effect of additives, various oxides of transition
metal oxides and rare earth oxides, on Li/MgO in the oxidative coupling of
methane (229). A number of dopants, for instance, Sn, Dy, Ti, and Tb, did
