Defects such as oxygen vacancies dominate the electronic and chemical properties of ceria. However,
fundamental understanding of such defects, especially clusters of vacancies, is sparse. In this work, we use
density-functional theory with the addition of the Hubbard U term to investigate various oxygen vacancies,
including the vacancy monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer, in which subsurface vacancies can also be
involved. We show that the individual surface and subsurface vacancies have very similar stabilities; the
vacancy dimer consisting of two surface vacancies, which is not reported experimentally, is stable in theory;
between the two vacancy trimers observed in experiments, the triangular surface vacancy cluster is more stable
than the double linear surface vacancy cluster containing a subsurface vacancy, which agrees with some
experiments but disagrees with some others; and the linear vacancy tetramer emerges as the most stable among
the possible tetramers containing subsurface vacancies, although it is less stable than those containing no
subsurface vacancies. These findings are rationalized in terms of the electronic change upon the removal of
oxygen, namely, the localization of resulting excess electrons on Ce f orbitals. We identify a correlation
between the energy levels of the occupied f states of reduced Ce ions and their coordination numbers, which
proves pivotal in interpreting formation energy and stability of various vacancies. Comparisons are made with
experiments and apparent discrepancies are discussed. Results for gold adsorption on the vacancy clusters are
presented, and the implications these have in catalysis are briefly discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The rare-earth oxide ceria CeO2 has recently emerged as
one of the most interesting oxides both technologically and
scientifically. Materials based on CeO2 are finding novel use
in a variety of processes such as automotive exhaust cataly-
sis, water-gas shift WGS reactions, fuel cells, and produc-
tion and purification of hydrogen.1,2 These applications of
CeO2 are largely attributed to its remarkable oxygen-storage
capability, i.e., the ability to undergo rapid redox cycles by
releasing and storing oxygen.3 Consequently, oxygen va-
cancy defects can play a central role: surface lattice oxygen
may act as an oxidant for adsorbates, thus creating oxygen
vacancies i.e., Marsvan Krevelen mechanism4; and vacan-
cies may serve as binding sites for catalytically active spe-
cies, thus promoting activity of the catalyst e.g., in the WGS
reaction catalyzed by Au/CeO2.5,6 To elucidate the roles of
ceria played in those applications, it is therefore of great
importance to understand the nature of oxygen vacancies.
With scanning tunneling microscopy STM and dynamic
force microscopy DFM, structures of O vacancies at the
reduced CeO2111 surfaces have been investigated.712 In
the first atomically resolved images produced by Nrenberg
and Briggs,7 oxygen vacancy clusters denoted as VCs here-
after were observed at the topmost layer of the surface, and
the dominant type of VC was of triangular shape containing
three O vacancies, schematically shown in Fig. 1. In contrast,
Namai et al.9 suggested that linear alignments of O vacan-
cies, consisting of two or more vacancies, are the major mul-
tiple defects, which appear in three different orientations re-
flecting the threefold symmetry of the 111 surface. The
discrepancy between these experiments was attributed to
different sample treatments.9 More detailed structures of O
vacancies were recently shown by Esch et al.11 With STM
and STM simulations, they found that for the slightly re-
duced CeO2111 surface, both SV and SSV were present
with similar concentrations. Upon prolonged annealing, VCs
appeared, with linear surface vacancy clusters LSVCs be-
ing the most dominant and triangular SVTs being the next
most abundant. The authors also proposed that VCs with
more than two vacancies exclusively expose reduced Ce ions
Fig. 1, and that to satisfy this interesting trend, each LSVC
must incorporate a subsurface oxygen vacancy. In a more
recent DFM study by Torbrgge et al.,12 explicit evidence of
isolated SSV buried at the third layer of the CeO2111 sur-
face was found. Furthermore, SSVs themselves exhibited in-
teresting structures: at high concentrations, SSVs appear in
ordered arrays with a tendency to form linear patterns, leav-
ing defect-free spacing of two lattice constants in between.
The discovery of VCs in ceria is of great significance. As
pointed out by Campbell and Peden,13 the groups of exposed
Ce3+ ions in the VCs would become a potentially potent
surface site for catalysis, as adsorbed gases or reaction inter-
mediates could interact simultaneously with several Ce3+
ions. Such VCs may even direct adsorbed metal nanopar-
ticles into specific shapes that may have advantages in ca-
talysis. However, images of VCs, particularly the shapes of
VCs, are not consistent in previous studies.7,9,11 There is also
a notable lack of theoretical understanding of VCs in ceria,
and most studies have so far concentrated on an isolated
vacancy.1416 In the present work, we have therefore under-
taken a detailed theoretical investigation on a series of oxy-
gen vacancies on CeO2111, including vacancy monomer,
dimer, trimer, and tetramer. We focus here on two fundamen-
tal aspects: i the energy required to form the oxygen defects

and ii the electronic structure of the reduced systems, as
highlighted in a recent review paper on O vacancies in
transition-metal and rare-earth oxides.17 In particular, owing
to the strong fCe electron localization effect, reduction of
the ceria surface leads to a change of valence from Ce4+ to
Ce3+, which differs from situations on many other oxide sur-
faces where either F center or electron delocalization would
occur upon reduction.17 This rather unique electron localiza-
tion feature therefore holds the key to understanding the in-
triguing nature of the vacancies on ceria and their implica-
tions in catalysis.
The present paper is organized as follows. Calculation
details are given in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we introduce all types
of vacancies considered and report vacancy formation ener-
gies. Following that, we discuss electronic structures and il-
lustrate the physical origin of the relative stabilities of those
vacancies in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, we make comparisons with
available experimental data and discuss the discrepancies
that have been found. In Sec. VI, we present some results of
Au adsorption on VCs which are likely to be relevant to and
have implications for catalysis. Our conclusions are summa-
rized in Sec. VII.
II. METHODOLOGY
We carry out spin-polarized calculations within the
density-functional theory DFT framework, as implemented
in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Program VASP, a plane-
wave
pseudopotential
DFT
package.1820
We
use
the
projector-augmented wave method to describe the effect of
the core electrons on the valence electrons in the system.21,22
The Ce 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f, and 6s electrons; the O 2s and 2p
electrons; and the Au 5d, 6s, and 6p electrons are treated as
valence electrons. For the electron exchange-correlation
functional the generalized gradient approximation GGA of
Perdew23 and Wang is used.
We choose the DFT+U methodology,24,25 which has
proven to be essential in descriptions of reduced ceria
systems.17 In this approach, the Hubbard parameter U is in-
troduced to account for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion
among the localized Ce 4f electrons. In practice, however,
the choice of this parameter is often empirical, which is to
say that the U value is adjusted to reproduce properties
known from experiments. There are a host of papers devoted
to the discussion of appropriate U values.14,15,2630 In study-
ing reduced ceria, Nolan et al.14 suggested U=5.0 eV for
GGA+U, as for U5.0 eV significant delocalization still
persists. Fabris et al.15 derived U=5.3 eV for local-density
approximation LDA and U=4.5 eV for GGA+U when us-
ing the maximally localized Wannier orbital as the projector
function. Andersson et al.29 showed that U6.0 eV for
LDA+U and U5.0 eV for GGA+U provide a consistent
description of pure CeO2 and Ce2O3 plus vacancies in CeO2.
Castleton et al.30 also suggested that the best overall choice
is U6.0 eV for LDA+U and U5.5 eV for GGA+U.
We note that although suggestions of U values vary, the op-
timal ones appear to be around 5.0 eV for GGA+U and 6.0
eV for LDA+U. We therefore use GGA+U U=5.0 eV in
the current work. We also carry out tests with GGA+U
U=4.5 or 5.5 eV and LDA+U U=6.0 eV, and our con-
clusions are not qualitatively affected by these choices.
The 111 face of ceria features termination of stoichio-
metric O-Ce-O trilayers stacked along the 111 direction
Fig. 1, and is the thermodynamically most stable facet. In
order to accommodate VCs as well as to minimize the inter-
action between VCs, a large 44 unit cell is chosen. In
some cases e.g., vacancy tetramers, tests with an even
larger 46 cell are performed, and no significant differ-
ence is found: the formation energy of vacancy tetramers
differs by only 0.03 eV from the calculations in the two cells.
The slabs employed in our calculations have nine atomic
layers, which is a common choice in studying ceria
surfaces.1416 The vacuum regions for the slabs are generally
around 12 Å. During structure optimizations atoms are al-
lowed to relax until the forces are smaller than 0.03 eV/Å,
except those in the lowest three layers that are constrained to
the equilibrium positions calculated for the defect-free super-
cell. We note that in the cases involving subsurface O vacan-
cies and the reduction of inner Ce ions, further relaxation of
the inner atoms might be necessary. Therefore, calculations
are also performed with slabs containing 12 atomic layers
including up to 192 atoms for vacancy dimers and trimers.
However, we find that characteristic electronic features, va-

cancy formation energies, and relative stabilities are very
similar between calculations from the 9-layer and the 12-
layer slabs. To reduce the computational cost, we therefore
use the 9-layer slab for the calculations of vacancy tetramers.
The sampling of the Brillouin zone was performed with a
221 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. The number of
plane waves, used to expand the Kohn-Sham orbitals, is con-
trolled by a cutoff energy of 400 eV, which is sufficient to
obtain well-converged results.31
It is well known that upon creation of an O vacancy, the
two excess electrons left behind by the removed O would
localize on the two neighboring Ce ions, leading to the re-
duction of Ce4+ to Ce3+.17 As will be shown shortly, the
location of the Ce3+ ions is vital in interpreting the stability
of reduced surfaces. Thus, for each vacancy or VC, we
have examined different starting spin configurations i.e., dif-
ferent locations of Ce3+, in order to identify the most stable
configuration. We find that the energy differences between
different spin configurations obtained for each vacancy or
VC are almost negligible. For example, for the surface with
SV, both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states
are found,15,32 but the antiferromagnetic arrangement is only
0.02 eV more stable. For the surface with SSV, the antifer-
romagnetic state is marginally more stable by 0.01 eV than
the ferromagnetic one. Therefore, we report below only the
most stable configurations, without overinterpreting the
alignment of neighboring spins.
III. VARIOUS VACANCIES AND VACANCY FORMATION
ENERGIES
We first consider single-oxygen vacancies by removing
either a topmost surface O atom or a subsurface O atom at
the third layer from the stoichiometric surface, as shown in
Fig. 2. Also shown are electron densities of the spin states
i.e., the occupied f states of Ce3+ ions, which will be de-
tailed in Sec. IV. To illustrate stability of these vacancies, we
list in Table I the formation energy per vacancy Ev

sponding to the f states at the

where Eslab
n , Eslab
stoi, and EO2 are energies of a surface with n O
vacancies, the perfect stoichiometric surface, and an O2 mol-
ecule, respectively. As can be seen, the two reduced surfaces
have similar energies: the surface with SSV is slightly more
stable by 0.06 eV than that with SV. We note that previous
GGA+U calculation also slightly preferred SSV to SV by
0.26 or 0.14 eV, but previous LDA+U calculation predicted
SV to be more stable by 0.03 or 0.15 eV, when using the
atomic orbitals or the localized Wannier orbitals as the pro-
jector functions, respectively, in the expression of the U
term.15 Although the relative stability of these defects ap-
pears to depend on the methodology, we consider that the
energy differences are insignificant since the vacancy forma-
tion energy is large 
2.2 eV in Table I. Moreover, the
similar energies of the two defects calculated in the present
work agree with the experiment finding that SVs and SSVs
have
similar
concentrations
on
the
slightly
reduced
surfaces.11
There are in principle two possible dimer vacancies Fig.
3, which could consist of either one SV plus one SSV
dimer I or two SVs dimer II, although Esch et al.11
claimed dimer I to be the only vacancy dimer that has been
observed. Our calculations find that both dimers I and II are
stable, with the former being 0.05 eV lower in energy than
the latter, as can be seen from Table I. In addition to Ev
a, we
also list in Table I the energy for the nth vacancy formation

where Eslab
n
and Eslab
n1 are the energies of surfaces with n and
n1 O vacancies. With respect to the most stable single va-
cancy i.e., SSV, we calculate the formation energies for the
second vacancy Ev
2 to be 2.53 and 2.58 eV for dimers I
and II, respectively, which are somewhat higher than Ev
1.
Moving to the vacancy trimer, we investigate the triangu-
lar SVT and the DLSVC,711 both of which were observed in
experiments, although conclusions vary as to which of these
is dominant. As shown in Fig. 4, SVT contains three surface
vacancies, whereas DLSVC contains two surface vacancies
and one subsurface vacancy. A common feature of the two
VCs is that both are exposed to six Ce neighbors, which are
just enough to accommodate the six excess electrons left
behind by the three released O atoms. Our calculations show
that SVT is 0.97 eV more stable than DLSVC: with respect
to the most stable dimer i.e., dimer I, the energies in form-
ing the third O vacancy in SVT and DLSVC are 2.30 and
3.28 eV, respectively. This result agrees with the experiment
of Nrenberg and Briggs,7 who stated that the defects first
appear as triangular ones and form linear defects only at
higher temperatures, but disagree with experiments of Namai
et al.9 and Esch et al.,11 who stated that the linear defects are
the main type.
The vacancy tetramers are created by removing a further
O atom from either DLSVC or SVT. Starting from DLSVC,
we can create three distinct yet stable vacancy tetramers by
removing one of the following O atoms, i.e., OI, OII, and OIII
Fig. 4, which are neighboring a sixfold, a fivefold, and a
fourfold Ce3+ ion, respectively.33 The resultant tetramers are
denoted as tetramers I, II, and III in Fig. 5. Starting from
trimer SVT, we can create two more tetramers by removing a
surface O neighboring a fivefold Ce3+ or a surface O neigh-
boring a sixfold Ce3+, which are denoted as tetramers IV and
V, respectively, in Fig. 6. In each of tetramers IV, the two
excess electrons left behind by the newly released O would
find two adjacent Ce ions, so the trend that the VCs exclu-
sively expose Ce3+ ions is preserved.
From values of Ev
a in Table I, tetramers IV and V are
clearly more stable by at least 0.9 eV than tetramers IIII,
i.e., analogous to the relative stability between trimer SVT
and DLSVC. With respect to the most stable trimer i.e.,
SVT, the formation energies of the fourth O vacancy Ev
4
in tetramers IV and V are 
2.3 eV, which is close to Ev
3
for trimer SVT or Ev
1 for monomers. The values of Ev
4 in
tetramers IIII would obviously be much higher if the same
