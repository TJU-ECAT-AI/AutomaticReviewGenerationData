Abstract
Temperaturechemical environmentoxidation state diagrams are proposed as an alternative way of reporting on the redox
behaviour of ceria-based catalytic materials. In these diagrams, the changes occurred in the reduction degree of the investigated
materials are plotted against temperature for different chemical atmospheres (5%O2/He, He, 5%H2/Ar, and 5%CO/He). Compared
to more conventional parameters like oxygen storage capacity, these diagrams allow us to gain a much wider view of the redox
response of the investigated system. As an example, the diagrams are used to discuss the redox properties of two different ceria-terbia
mixed oxide samples.

1. Introduction
As deduced from some recent monographs [1,2], ceria
and ceria-based mixed oxides are being intensively inves-
tigated. A major reason for this interest is the relevance
of their catalytic applications, in most of cases closely re-
lated to their ability for exchanging oxygen with their
chemical environment [37].
A variety of techniques has been applied to the redox
characterisation of these materials [810]. Among them,
oxygen storage capacity (OSC) is one of the most com-
monly used [10]. Complete (OSCC), also referred to as
ultimate or total, and dynamic (OSCD) oxygen storage
capacity measurements are usually distinguished [10,11].
OSCC estimates the top limit amount of oxygen ex-
changed by the material under certain pre-established
conditions [12,13]; OSCD being aimed at evaluating
the most readily available oxygen species [10,1416].
The so-called oxygen buffering capacity (OBC) tech-
nique [1719] may also be included in the OSCD cate-
gory.
OBC, in
effect,
allows
us
to
quantitatively
measure the capability of a redox material to attenuate
the oxygen partial pressure oscillations occurring in a
gaseous stream. These oscillations are induced by fast
pulsing of O2 over flowing He. Compared to the typical
OSCD techniques, in which CO [6,7,10] or H2 [11,15,16]
are used as reducing agents; in the case of OBC experi-
ments, the reducing conditions are created by an inert
gas atmosphere [17].
The experimental conditions under which the OSC
values are determined, however, are far from standardi-
sation [15]. Key experimental variables like the nature
and partial pressure of the reducing agent, or the reduc-
tion time and temperature, often differ from one lab-
oratory to the other, thus very much complicating
the correlation of OSC values from different sources.

Moreover, secondary processes other than that implic-
itly assumed to be involved in the oxidising part of the
OSC cycle, i.e. titration of oxygen vacancies, may signif-
icantly contribute to the OSC values. Such is the case of
hydrogen spillover, which has been shown to play a key
role in determining the high OSCD values recorded,
even at room temperature, on a Pt/Ce0.68Zr0.32O2 cata-
lyst [15].
This work reports on an alternative way of depicting
the redox properties of these materials. By following this
approach, a rather broad picture of the redox response of
a certain material under a wide range of experimental con-
ditions (temperature and chemical environment) may be
summarised in a single plot. As shown in this work, these
temperaturechemical environmentoxidation state dia-
grams constitute an easily readable way of providing
much, very useful, information about the investigated
systems.
2. Experimental
In this work, two different ceria-terbia mixed oxides:
Ce0.80Tb0.20O2  x and Ce0.90Tb0.10O2  y, hereafter re-
ferred to as CT-80/20 and CT-90/10, respectively, will
be studied. They were prepared by co-precipitation with
ammonia from an aqueous solution containing the
appropriate molar ratio of Ce(NO3)3 and Tb(NO3)3.
The precipitates were repeatedly washed with distilled
water, dried in air at 383 K, and calcined at 873 K, for
4 h. To stabilise the surface area of the resulting oxides,
they were reduced under flowing H2, at 1223 K, for 4 h,
then flushed with He at 1223 K, for 1 h, cooled under
flowing He to room temperature, and finally re-oxidised
by heating them in a flow of 5%O2/He up to 873 K, 1 h,
and cooled under the same atmosphere to 298 K. The
BET surface area of the resulting oxide samples was
found to be the same: 4 m2 g1. Prior to all the experi-
ments, the samples were heated in a flow of 5%O2/He
up to 873 K, then, they were kept for 1 h at this temper-
ature, and finally, they were slowly cooled to 398 K, al-
ways under flowing 5%O2/He. At this temperature, the
gas flow was switched to He and the oxides were cooled
down to 298 K. By applying this pre-treatment, a repro-
ducible starting redox state for the oxides could be
achieved. The experimental protocol applied in this
work may be summarised as follows: 200 mg of the
oxide samples pre-treated as indicated above, were
heated step by step at increasing temperatures from
573 up to 1223 K in flow of either 5%O2/He, He,
5%H2/Ar, or 5%CO/He. The gas flow was always
60 cm3 min1, and the heating rate: 10 K min1. The
sample was maintained at each of the pre-established
temperatures until an apparent redox equilibrium was
reached. Then, the heating program started again and
a new step was recorded. The redox changes undergone
by the sample throughout the whole experiment (Heat-
ing ramp and isothermal part of the step) were continu-
ously monitored by analysing the gas flow downstream
the reactor. For experiments carried out under flowing
He, 5%H2/Ar, or 5%CO/He, the analytical device con-
sisted of a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS). For
runs performed in a flow of 5%O2/He, a thermal con-
ductivity detector (TCD) ought to be used, because of
the low sensitivity of the MS device to the changes
occurred in the chemical composition of gaseous stream.
The redox state of the oxide samples was tracked by
analysing, respectively, O2 (m/e: 32), in the case of exper-
iments performed under flowing 5%O2/He, and He; H2O
(m/e: 18) for those run in a flow of 5%H2/Ar, and CO2
(m/e: 44) when the chemically active atmosphere con-
sisted of 5%CO/He. In the latter case, secondary reac-
tions other than the oxygen vacancy creation process
were checked not to contribute to the CO2 formation
significantly. The quantitative calibrations were per-
formed by using well characterized oxide samples: a ter-
bium oxide [20], for oxygen, an aged-in-air lanthanum
oxide [21], for CO2, and copper (II) oxide for H2O.
The reference quantitative data were obtained from par-
allel TG experiments.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Temperaturechemical environmentoxidation state
diagrams
The Ce-Tb mixed oxides pre-treated under the oxidis-
ing conditions reported in Section 2 are better described
as partly reduced fluorite phases, CenTb1  nO2  x. In
these oxygen deficient samples, cerium mainly consists
of Ce4+ species, whereas a significant concentration of
both Tb3+ and Tb4+ ions coexist [22,23]. Since the exper-
iments to be reported below induce a progressive reduc-
tion of the investigated oxides, they will lead to phases
which may be formulated as CenTb1  nO(2  x)  d.
As an example, Fig. 1 summarises the results ob-
tained in one of the stepwise reduction experiments
carried out on the CT-80/20 mixed oxide sample. In
particular, it corresponds to its thermal evolution under
flowing He. Upon integration of the oxygen traces re-
corded at each of the steps, Fig. 1(a), the amount of
evolved oxygen, and, therefore, the change (d) occurred
in the stoichiometry of the oxide, could be determined.
From these results, the corresponding temperature-oxi-
dation state (oxide stoichiometry) plot, under flowing
He, could be built up, Fig. 1(b). By following the same
procedure under flowing 5%O2/He, 5%H2/Ar, and
5%CO/He, similar temperatureoxidation state plots
could be depicted for sample CT-80/20, Fig. 2. A rather
similar study could also be performed on the CT-90/10
sample, see for a detail Fig. 3(b).

For any of these plots, the successive heating steps im-
ply a progressive reduction of the oxide, the extent of
which (Dd) depending on the nature of the flowing gas
and the specific temperature step: Ce0.8Tb0.2O(2  x)  d1
! Ce0.8Tb0.2O(2  x)  d2 (Dd = d2  d1). For all the dia-
grams in Fig. 2, the common origin in the stoichiometry
axis (d-axis), d = 0, would correspond to the most
oxidised state of the mixed oxide sample, i.e. the state
resulting from the application of the standardised pre-
treatment under flowing 5%O2/He.
Upon analysing the temperaturechemical environ-
mentoxidation state diagram in Fig. 2, much, very use-
ful, redox information may be drawn from it. Thus, the
classic OSCC data, for the different reduction tempera-
tures and flowing gases may be easily deduced from
the corresponding di, j values (reduction temperature Ti
on the plot recorded under the flowing gas Gj). In addi-
tion, the diagram allows us to determine the change
occurring in the oxidation state, Dd = di2, j2  di1, j1
(Ti2 > Ti1; Gj2 more reducible environment than that cre-
ated by Gj1), of a certain sample upon varying either the
temperature under the same gas flow (j2 = j1), the nature
of the flowing gas at constant temperature (i2 = i1), or
both, temperature and chemical environment.
There is some other qualitative information which
may be deduced from these diagrams. Thus, the com-
parison of the low-temperature region, at Ti = 573 K,
of 5%CO/He, 5%H2/Ar, He, and 5%O2/He plots in
Fig. 2, strongly suggests that the reduction of the CT-
80/20 sample is kinetically controlled under both hydro-
gen and helium flows, the reduction degree reached by
the oxide being much lower than expected from the
extrapolation
of
the
results
obtained
at
higher
temperatures.
Likewise, the diagrams may help to rationalise some
aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which
at a first sight might appear as striking. Thus, Fig. 3 re-
ports on the evolution of the OBC behaviour of the
CT-90/10 sample as a function of the temperature. As de-
duced from this figure, upon increasing the temperature,

the capability of the oxide to attenuate the oscillations in
the partial pressure of oxygen goes though a maximum
at T = 873 K, and then it decreases. If analysed the evo-
lution with T of the He and O2/He plots in Fig. 3(b), the
high-temperature loss of redox efficiency in this sample
may reasonably be interpreted as due to thermodynamic
reasons, i.e. the progressive decrease of Dd = di1, j2 
di1, j1 (j2: He; j1: 5%O2/He) upon increasing the temper-
ature above 873 K.
To summarize, by running a rather limited number of
simple experiments, the proposed approach allows us to
gain a view of the redox behaviour of ceria-based cata-
lytic materials over a wide range of temperatures and
chemical environments, thus becoming a useful tool
for characterising this sort of materials.
