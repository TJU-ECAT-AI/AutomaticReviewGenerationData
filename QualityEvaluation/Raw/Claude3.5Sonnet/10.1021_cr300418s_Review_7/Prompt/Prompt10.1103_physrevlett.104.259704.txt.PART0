I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Yim, Pang, and Thornton Reply: The Comment of
Wendt et al. [1] on our Letter [2] primarily claims that
the electron beam method that we use in our experiment to
vary the density of bridging oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on
rutile TiO2110 also leads to damage of the near-surface
region. Contrary to this assertion, in a two-photon photo-
emission spectroscopy study of TiO2110, Onda et al. [3]
demonstrate that the defects created on the nearly perfect
TiO2110 surface after exposure to a 500 eV electron
dose are completely healed by a submonolayer coverage of
O2 at 100 K. This indicates that the defects are located at
the surface. In contrast, defects formed by thermal anneal-
ing can only be partially quenched by O2 exposure, sug-
gesting an additional contribution from the subsurface
region. The electrons in our experiment are less energetic
(75 eV) than those employed by Onda et al. [3]. On this
basis, it is clear that we do not expect to induce any
significant damage in the near-surface region (as opposed
to the surface plane) with our electron beam.
The evidence presented to support the claim of a subsur-
face change produced by the electron beam is the supposed
nonlinearity of the Ob vac density dependence on the
electron irradiation time compared with the variation of
the band gap photoemission intensity. However, this de-
viation from a perfect straight line is the scatter that might
be expected where there is a small variation in Ob vac
density across the surface. This will be reflected in the
STM measurement because only a nanoscale area is mea-
sured, while the photoemission data are macroscopically
averaged.
Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2)
were designed to measure the connection between the
band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way. It relies on
the known creation of OHb by the reaction of H2O with Ob
vac [4,5] and the unchanged intensity of the band-gap state
when an Ob vac is converted to OHb [6]. The data, which
are shown in Fig. 1, are very clear in showing that the band-
gap state scales linearly with the density of OHb species
created by reacting water with the Ob vac [the values are
plotted in Fig. 4(b) in Ref. [2]]. Part of this data set shows
the effect on the band-gap state of oxidizing h-TiO2, with a
reduction to 15% of its original intensity. Electron beam
irradiation for 10 s and rehydroxylation restores the band-
gap state and the OHb density to their original values. This
is all consistent with a dominating Ob vac contribution to
the band-gap state. It is worth noting that the reduction of
the band-gap state to 15% on oxidation compares with a
figure of 60%70% quoted in Refs. [1,7]. The latter values
were used to associate Ti interstitials with the band-gap
state. A likely cause of this discrepancy is the ex situ nature
of the earlier measurements, which rely on the repeatabil-
ity of sample preparation procedures. In contrast, our STM
and photoemission measurements were carried out on
identical surfaces in situ.

STM images (125  125

hydroxylated TiO2110 (h-TiO2), (b) the oxidized TiO2110
(o-TiO2) surface, and (c)(e) the surface in (b) after electron
bombardment (75 eV) for 2, 5, and 10 s, respectively. All STM
images were collected with a tunneling current 0:2 nA and a
sample bias voltage of 1.3 V at 78 K. Symbols indicate OHb
(circles) and OxHy (hexagons). (f) Corresponding ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy He I spectra recorded at 300 K
of h-TiO2 (red), o-TiO2 (blue), and o-TiO2 following electron
bombardment for 2 s (green), 5 s (orange), and 10 s (black), all
recorded under identical conditions. Only the region near the
band-gap state [0:9 eV below the Fermi level (EF)] is shown in
the spectra. The data points are shown as squares, and the curves
are the best fit to a Gaussian and polynomial background. The
spectra in (f) corresponding to each surface are colored the same
as the color borders in (a)(e). Of the spectra shown, the one
showing the second highest peak corresponds to (a), the lowest
corresponds to (b), the second lowest corresponds to (c), the
median corresponds to (d), and the highest corresponds to (e).

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
