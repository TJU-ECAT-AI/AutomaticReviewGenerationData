DFT + U calculations of Cu-doped bulk ceria are presented. The first oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria
forms almost spontaneously and the second vacancy is also easily created. Whether zero, one or two oxy-
gen vacancies, the Cu dopant is in the form Cu(+II), and prefers to be 4-coordinated in a close to planar
structure. Charge compensation, structural relaxation and available CuO states all play roles in lowering
the O vacancy formation energies, but to different degrees when the first and second oxygen vacancies
are formed. The Cu-doped ceria(1 1 1) surface system behaves in a similar fashion.

1. Introduction
Several studies in the literature have shown that copperceria
systems (CuCeO2) are efficient catalysts for the watergas shift
(WGS) reaction (see, for example, Ref. [1]), the reduction of SO2
by CO [2], and the selective hydrogen combustion reaction [3].
CuCeO2 systems are also interesting in the context of solid oxide
fuel cell (SOFC) technology [4] due to the excellent electronic con-
ductivity of Cu and the high catalytic activity of CeO2 for CH bond
breaking in CH4, especially when mixed with particular noble met-
als dopants [5].
In the present Letter we discuss Cu-doped ceria. For the WGS
and the SOFC applications, the literature suggests that it is copper
metal at the Cu/ceria interface that is particularly active. In other
cases, however, Cu-doped ceria surfaces are believed to be the ac-
tive catalysts, as in the case of SO2 reduction by CO referred to
above. On the whole, it should be noted that the exact form of
Cu in CuCeO catalysts is still a matter of debate and depends
much on the particular preparation protocol used. For example,
Avgouropoulos et al. [6] concluded that either finely dispersed cop-
per oxide, or a solid solution, or alternatively, a combination of
these two, may be formed on the surface of ceria in the CuO
CeO2 catalysts. Djinovic et al. [7] reported both nanosized and
bulk-like CuO species on the ceria surfaces of their CuCeO cata-
lysts, but in addition presented evidence for strong metal oxide-
support interactions (SMSI) with CuO partly integrated into CeO2,
forming a solid solution.
Controlled experiments reported in the literature give some
information about the structure and dynamics of Cu-doped ceria
solid solutions. Electrical conductivity measurements have shown
that a CuxCe1xO2d (0 6 x 6 0.10) solid solution exhibits good
oxide-ion conductivity [8]. As for structure, Bera et al. [9] pre-
sented a comprehensive experimental study of Cu-doped ceria
samples using a range of methods; their EXAFS analyses for
CuxCe1xO2d samples with x equal to 0.03, 0.05 and 0.10 sug-
gested that Cu has three oxygen atoms in its first coordination
shell, located at a distance of 1.96 Å. Wang et al. [10] performed
synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EXAFS measure-
ments for CuxCe1 - xO2 samples with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 as well
as quantummechanical calculations). Their EXAFS fits indicated a
CuO coordination number of 56 (while their quantummechan-
ical calculations suggested that the Cu atom in bulk ceria has four
oxygen atom neighbors at a distance of 1.921.95 Å). Moreover, in
their experiments they also found that the Cu dopants always gave
rise to a corresponding number of O vacancies, i.e. that vacancy for-
mation is very much facilitated by Cu doping and the oxygen storage
capacity remarkably enhanced [10]. Here, we will explore exactly
that property by means of quantummechanical calculations.
Only a few quantummechanical studies of the structure and
electronic properties of the CuCeO2 systems have appeared in
the literature. To the best of our knowledge all these studies ex-
plored unreduced samples, i.e. without O vacancies. As mentioned,
Wang et al. studied bulk CeO2, CuO, Cu2O, Cu0.25Ce0.75O2 and
Cu0.125Ce0.875O2 [10], while Shapovalov and Metiu [11] reported

on top of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface (this gave a Cu(+I) ion) and the
weaker adsorption above an O vacancy (gave a negative Cu ion)
as part of a study of CO and CO2 interacting with the CuCeO2 sys-
tem. Branda et al. [13] also studied a Cu atom on top of an O-ter-
minated CeO2(1 1 1) (with a variety of LDA + U and GGA + U
flavors) in a study of Cu, Ag and Ag on ceria(1 1 1). They found
Cu symmetrically surrounded by three O atoms to be the most
favorable adsorption site with all the different methods they tried,
as we also did in Ref. [12], and as us, they found that Cu oxidizes to
Cu(+I). In Ref. [12], we also studied the Cu-doped ceria(1 1 1)
surface.
In the present density functional theory (DFT) study we continue
to study the effect of Cu-doping, this time for bulk ceria. We will
find that the first oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria is formed al-
most spontaneously and the formation of a second vacancy is also
facile. We will also find that charge compensation, structural relax-
ation and available d- and f-electron levels all play a role here, but to
different degrees when the first and second oxygen vacancies are
formed. We end the Letter by making some comparisons between
bulk and surface of Cu-doped ceria and in the conclusion section
we give some general remarks about the effect of aliovalent transi-
tion metal dopants on the O vacancy formation in ceria.
2. Computational details
2.1. Electronic structure calculations
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vien-
na ab initio simulation package (VASP) package [14,15] with the
projector augmented wave (PAW) method [16] and the Perdew
BurkeErnzerhof (PBE) functional [17]. The cerium 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f,
6s, the oxygen 2s, 2p and the copper 3d, 4s electrons were treated
as valence electrons.
Based on the discussion in Ref. [18] and some references there-
in, the PBE + U method [19] was applied to accurately describe the
strong on-site Coulomb repulsion of the Ce4f electrons. Here an
effective U value of 5.0 eV was chosen to give a balanced and ade-
quate description of the atomic and electronic structures for both
stoichiometric
(CeO2)
and
partially
reduced
ceria
(CeO2x)
[18,20]. In all of our calculations, plane waves were used as the ba-
sis set, with an energy cutoff of 30 Ry. The structure optimizations
were performed until the force on each atom was smaller than
0.02 eV/Å. An atomic charge analysis was performed according to
the Bader scheme [21].
2.2. Model systems and the definition of the O vacancy formation
energy
Crystalline CeO2 bulk has the fluorite structure where one Ce
atom is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms (similar to the framed
region in Figure 1a). The current calculations for stoichiometric
ceria give an equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.480 Å; the experi-
mental room-temperature value is 5.411 Å [22].
For Cu-doped bulk, a supercell containing 96 atoms was built
from the conventional 12-atom cubic unit cell of CeO2 with a
2  2  2 replication and one Ce atom was replaced by a Cu atom.
This corresponds to a dopant concentration of 3% and is denoted
as Ce0.97Cu0.03O2. The structure was optimized using either a 3 k-
point grid (corresponding to a 3  3  3 MonkhorstPack grid
[23]) or only one k point (the gamma point). The total energy was
found to be the same within 0.01 eV and the local structure around
the Cu defect was almost identical. Here we then subsequently used
one k point for all bulk systems (unreduced and reduced), and a
GAUSSIAN smearing parameter Sigma of 0.01 eV. The doped system
was assumed to keep the cubic structure and therefore forced to do
so, and the cell parameter and atomic positions were optimized,
resulting in a cell change of less than 0.05%, compared to the un-
doped case. Thus for all of the systems studied in this Letter, the cell
parameters were fixed at the corresponding undoped values.
Oxygen vacancies were created in various positions with
respective the Cu dopant; details are given in the Results and dis-
cussion section. The O vacancy formation energy (Evac) was calcu-
lated after optimization of the atomic positions for each system
according to
First Evac  Ecell with one O vacancy  1=2 EO2
 Ecell without an O vacancy
1
Second Evac  Ecell with two O vacancies  1=2 EO2
 Ecell with one O vacancy
2
E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an optimized
oxygen molecule in the gas phase. A positive value of Evac means
that energy is needed to create a vacancy.
As an alternative to using the oxygen molecule as a reference
state in the formulas above, and in an attempt to avoid the DFT er-
ror connected to the description of the O2 molecule, one might pre-
fer to use the O atom as the reference state instead. The difference
between these definitions of Evac is exactly half the binding energy
for O2. Our calculated value for the binding energy is 6.18 eV. Here
we only report the Evac value with respect to the PBE-calculated O2
molecule.

3. Results and discussion
Table 1 lists quantities related to the interaction between the Cu
dopant and bulk ceria, namely, Evac, R(CuO) and the net (Bader)
charge that the Cu atom acquires in the various systems. The opti-
mized structures and the details of the electronic structure such as
the total density of states (TDOS) and the corresponding electron
densities are shown in the figures. Results for the ceria(1 1 1) sur-
face are given in Table 1 for comparison and are discussed in
Section 3.3.
3.1. Cu-doped bulk ceria
A Ce atom was replaced by a Cu atom in bulk CeO2 in the 96-
atom supercell. The Cu dopant was thus initially placed at the cen-
ter of one of the cubes formed by the 8 oxygen atoms surrounding
the Ce atom in ceria. The optimization brought the Cu atom (al-
most) all the way down to the face of the O cube. At this new posi-
tion, the Cu atom is 4-coordinated in a close-to-planar structure
(Figure 1a) similar to the Cu coordination in CuO bulk (Figure 1b).
The Cu ion is seen to distort the ceria lattice by contracting the O
square surrounding it and pushing away those O atoms which lost
their cation neighbor when Cu moved away. The Cu-dopant loses
about 1.20 electrons according to the Bader charge analysis when
incorporated in the ceria lattice, and thus becomes Cu+1.20. This is
even a little more than the Cu charge in pure CuO bulk (Cu+1.02),
mainly due to the O-rich environment in ceria. The Cu dopant
has only a small effect on the Ce charges but some of the O ions be-
come less negative (by in total about 2 electrons), compared to un-
doped CeO2.
An O vacancy was introduced as a nearest-neighbor (NN) to the
Cu dopant, the structure was reoptimized, and Evac was calculated
to 0.98 eV, which is much smaller than for undoped ceria (3.28 eV
in our calculations). The Cu dopant is here coordinated by three O
neighbors (Figure 2a, Table 1) and the three Ce cations surround-
ing the vacancy are all (nominally) Ce4+, contrary to the situation
for undoped ceria where an O vacancy gives rise to two Ce4+ and
two Ce3+ ions (nominal charges) next to the O vacancy. If instead
an O atom which is a next-nearest neighbor (NNN) to the Cu dop-
ant is removed (Figure 2b, Table 1), we find that it is even easier
to create an O vacancy: now Evac is only 0.30 eV. The coordination
around Cu is here 4-fold, with CuO bond lengths similar to those
in the CuO crystal structure [24], where Cu2+ has four O neighbors
within 1.902.00 Å and the next-nearest O neighbors reside 0.8
0.9 Å further away. The three Ce cations surrounding the vacancy
are (nominally) Ce4+ and their Bader charges differ very little
from pure CeO2 (or unreduced Cu-doped CeO2), mainly because
the O vacancy reinstates the charge balance in the system and
remedies the shortage of electrons caused by the lower valence
of Cu (2+) compared to Ce (4+), i.e. makes the O ions more
negative again.
The Bader charge of the nominal Cu2+ ion is +0.98 and +1.06 for
the NN and NNN reduced cases, respectively. The Cu ion thus con-
tinues to be a Cu(+II) ion (cf. the Bader charge of +1.02 for Cu in
CuO) even after the O vacancy is formed close to it.
Since we find that the first O vacancy is essentially a spontane-
ous defect in Cu-doped ceria (especially at the NNN position), the
second O vacancy becomes particularly interesting in the context
of this materials catalytic functionality. We created an O vacancy
dimer by removing the O atom neighboring the first (NNN) oxygen
vacancy, as shown in Figure 3. Evac for the second O vacancy is
2.39 eV, which is still smaller than Evac in stoichiometric ceria bulk.

The local 4-fold CuO coordination persists (Figure 3, Table 1) and
the Cu charge is +1.03, i.e. very similar to the charge for one va-
cancy only. Two of the nominal Ce4+ cations neighboring the O va-
cancy are reduced to Ce3+ (denoted as # in Figure 3) and develop
spin moments of about 1.0 lB each. The magnetic spin moment is
0.46 lB for the Cu dopant, resulting in a total spin moment of
2.83 lB for the supercell.
3.2. The mechanisms facilitating the O vacancy formation with a Cu
dopant
It has been suggested in the literature that Evac depends almost
linearly on the ionic radius of the dopant ions for tetravalent ele-
ments doped into bulk ceria [25]. This suggests that structural
relaxation is the main factor governing the reduction of the Evac.
What can be expected for the Cu dopant, an aliovalent dopant with
lower valence (Cu2+) as compared with the host cations (Ce4+)? Is
structural relaxation or electronic effects the main factor responsi-
ble for the lowering of Evac?
To help answer this question we use a somewhat simplistic
model and divide Evac into an elastic and an electronic part. More
details about the procedure can be found in Ref. [26]. It involves
calculating the total energies for all the unrelaxed reduced sys-
tems. For the first O vacancy (in the NNN position), two addi-
tional
single-point
calculations
were
therefore
performed,
namely, for the unrelaxed CeO1.97 and Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.97 bulk sys-
tems. This allowed us to calculate the energy cost to rigidly re-
move an O atom from the optimized CeO2 and Ce0.97Cu0.03O2
crystals, respectively. Subsequent relaxations of the two struc-
tures yielded energy gains of 1.40 eV for CeO1.97 and 2.79 eV for
Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.97. Thus the energy gain due to the relaxation of
Cu-doped ceria bulk is 1.39 eV larger than for undoped ceria bulk
(namely, 2.79 eV versus 1.40 eV). These energy gains are already
included in the final Evac values of 3.28 and 0.30 eV for undoped
and Cu-doped ceria bulk.
Thus, out of the total dopant-induced lowering of Evac by 2.98 eV,
we find that 1.39 eV is due to the additional relaxation taking place
Figure 3. Relaxed structure for partially reduced Cu-doped ceria bulk with two O
vacancies. (For interpretation of the references in color in this figure, the reader is

in the presence of the dopant. This contribution to the lowering of
the vacancy formation energy is mainly due to the different radii
of the dopant (0.74 Å for Cu2+) and the host cation (0.92 Å for Ce4+)
[27]. The remainder (1.59 eV) must be attributed to the changes in
electronic structure induced by the Cu2+ dopant. Wang et al. [10] as-
cribe the easy formation of O vacancies in Cu-doped bulk ceria to a
large strain in the ceria lattice introduced by the Cu dopant.
The second Evac value (2.39 eV) for the Cu-doped system is
0.89 eV smaller than the first Evac value for undoped ceria bulk.
We will find that this decrease is dominated by dopant-induced
electronic structure changes. Also here additional calculations
were performed to pinpoint the respective contributions from
strain and electronic effects. An O atom was removed rigidly (no
relaxation was allowed) from the optimized Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.97 sys-
tem, creating Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.94, which was subsequently allowed
to relax. The relaxation energy was found to be 1.05 eV, i.e.
0.35 eV smaller than that accompanying the formation of the first
vacancy of undoped ceria (1.40 eV). Since the total lowering of Evac
for the second vacancy in Cu-doped ceria is 0.89 eV relative to the
first vacancy in undoped ceria (cf. Table 1), we conclude that dop-
ant-induced changes in the electronic structure decrease Evac by
1.24 eV (0.35 + 0.89 eV).
In summary, both the first and second Evac energies in our Cu-
doped bulk ceria samples are smaller than Evac for undoped ceria
(3.28 eV). For the first vacancy, the lowering is as large as 2.98 eV
and our analysis shows that about half of this decrease can be
attributed to electronic effects and half to large structural relaxa-
tion when the Cu dopant is present. For the second vacancy, the
Evac lowering is 0.89 eV compared to the same undoped ceria value
(3.28 eV). Here the electronic effects are responsible for 100% of the
decrease, since the smaller relaxation energy actually increases the
Evac value compared to undoped ceria.
