The reduction of CeO, by hydrogen has been studied from 300-1200 K by several complementary techniques: 
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements, Fourier-transform infra- 
red (FTIR), UV-VIS diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy. Two CeO, samples were used 
with B.E.T. surface areas of 115 and 5 m2 
g-' , respectively. The concentration of Ce3+ 
was determined 
in 
situ by 
measuring the magnetic susceptibility and the Ce"' photoemission line. The reduction began at 473 K, irrespec- 
tive of the initial surface area of the ceria. In the case of the low-surface-area sample, an intermediate reduction 
step was observed between 573 and 623 K, corresponding to the reduction of the surface. This intermediate step 
was less easily observed in the case of the high-surface-area ceria. In both cases, the reduction led to a 
stabilised state with the formal composition C
e
O
,
.
,
,
 
. Temperatures higher than 923 K were required to reduce 
the ceria further. The surface Ce"' content determined by XPS was close to that determined by magnetic sus- 
ceptibility measurements. The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band in the UV-VIS reflectance spectrum also varied 
with the degree of reduction. Finally, the evolution of the surface species observed by IR spectroscopy was in 
good agreement with the results from the other techniques. The IR results indicated large changes in the con- 
centration and nature of both the hydroxyl and the polydentate carbonate species during the reduction process. 
The adsorption of oxygen on samples previously reduced to the composition CeO,.,, 
led to almost complete 
reoxidation at room temperature. The state of the initial B.E.T. surface did not influence the oxidation process. A 
slight excess adsorption of oxygen was evident on the surface. This was thermodesorbed at 380 K under 
vacuum 
. 
When heated to high temperatures or treated in reducing 
atmospheres, cerium dioxide is known to show large devi- 
ations from 
its CeO, 
stoichiometric composition. '-' 
However, subsequent treatment with oxygen leads to rapid 
re-establishment of its normal stoichiometry. These redox 
properties of CeO, are utilised in catalytic devices developed 
for the automotive post-combustion process, since the cerium 
oxide is a regulator of the oxygen partial pressure over the 
atalyst.'. 
Several experimental techniques have been used 
to study the interaction of reducing agents such as hydrogen 
or carbon monoxide with CeO,: gravimetry, TPR, FTIR, 
H-NMR, EPR e t  .  ,  -   
However, there is a need for more 
quantitative 
results 
concerning 
the 
extent 
of 
non- 
stoichiometry on well characterised samples. For example, in 
the TPR experiments, some artifacts can interfere in the inter- 
pretation of the measurements, e.g. the effect of the hydro- 
genation of carbonates on the H, consumption. Also some 
techniques 
require 
certain 
experimental 
conditions 
(temperature, atmosphere) which make it impossible to char- 
acterise the Ce4+-Ce3 
+ valence changes under the reaction 
conditions. Finally, although the extent of the B.E.T. surface 
area has been recognised to be an important parameter in the 
H, reduction proceses,' 
the discrimination between the 
surface and the bulk reduction is still not fully understood. 
This work is a comprehensive study of CeO, reduction by 
H, using several complementary techniques. The magnetic 
susceptibility method is particularly suitable in monitoring 
the reduction since it allows one to follow the valence 
changes of the cerium ion in situ. The method utilises the fact 
that the Ce4+ ion is diamagnetic whereas Ce3+ is paramag- 
netic, the latter having a 4f unpaired electron with a magnetic 
moment close to 2.5 pB. 
The UV-VIS diffuse reflectance method is also an appro- 
priate technique since it is able to detect any changes in the 
bulk. FTIR and XP spectroscopies, however, are more sensi- 
tive to changes in the surface species. In particular, XPS is a 
semi-quantitative method for determining the oxidation state 
changes by curve fitting of the photoemission spectra. 
Experimental 
Materials 
The two CeO, samples were obtained from Rh8ne Poulenc. 
The first (Ce0,-400) was prepared at 673 K and had a B.E.T. 
surface area of 115 m2 g-' with a high proportion of micro- 
porous area (surface = 
61 m2 g-'). By calcination of this 
high-surface-area sample at 1123 K, a second sample 
(Ce0,-850) was obtained, with a B.E.T. surface area of 5 m2 
8-l. The purity was 99.5%, with La,O, as the main impurity 
(0.3%). Before each run, after being heated at a rate of 5 K 
min- ', 
the samples were standardised for 1 h at 673 K under

a flow of oxygen and then treated for 1 h at the same tem- 
perature either under vacuum or under rare gas before 
cooling to room temperature. 
After this standardisation treatment at 673 K, no water 
remained in the solid, as shown by vacuum thermodesorption 
up to 1073 K. However, residual carbonate species were still 
present and could be thermodesorbed as CO, with a 
maximum at 810 K. The total weight loss of CO, was 42 
pmol g- '. 
TPR 
The apparatus is described in ref. 10. The H, consumption 
was measured by means of a catharometric detector. The 
reactants (1% H, in Ar) were passed over the catalyst (200 
mg) with a 1.1 dm3 h-' flow rate. The water produced by the 
reduction was trapped on a molecular sieve. The heating rate 
was 8 K min-'. 
FTIR and UV Spectroscopy 
IR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 60 SX spectrometer 
using the absorbance mode. The UV-VIS diffuse reflectance 
spectra were recorded on a Beckmann 5240 spectrometer 
equipped with an integrating sphere. 
Gravimetric and Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements 
These were performed in a Faraday microbalance built in the 
laboratory" and connected to a 50 dm3 s-' ion pump which 
allowed pressures < 
10- ' 
Torr.7 The magnetic susceptibility 
x was obtained using the Faraday method in the range 294- 
lo00 
K. 
The 
calibration 
was 
carried 
out 
using 
(NH,),Fe(SO,), 
- 6H,O as a standard and corrections for the 
sample holder and ferromagnetic impurities were made as 
explained in ref. 12. A quadrupole mass spectrometer (MQ 63 
Riber) was used to analyse the gases during the thermode- 
sorption experiments. The sample (100-150 mg) was depos- 
ited in the sample holder on a quartz wool bed. The 
reduction experiments were performed under a flow of puri- 
fied hydrogen (4 dm3 h- '). 
The magnetic susceptibility of the initial sample under 
vacuum, -0.03 
emu g-' 
(to be multiplied by 
12.56 x lop3 
to obtain the SI units in m3 kg-I), correspond- 
ed to a slightly diamagnetic sample, which is to be expected 
for Ce4+ 
ions. It was not changed by the standardisation nor 
by a treatment at 1073 K at 
Torr. Thus, even though 
there may be a slight initial Ce3+ content, it is clear that the 
dehydroxylation or the decarbonation of the ceria does not 
result in the formation of Ce3+ ions to any significant extent. 
Note also that the ferromagnetic impurity content was low 
(3-6 ppm) and did not vary significantly during the reduction 
treatments. 
XPS 
Spectra were recorded on a VG spectrometer using Al-Ka 
radiation, the power of the X-ray source being 200 W. The 
base pressure during analysis was lo-' Torr. 
The samples were pressed into pellets (at 10 kg ern-,) after 
the standardization treatment and were mounted on a nickel 
sample holder that allowed reduction treatments up to 1173 
K. Unless otherwise stated, the samples were treated with H, 
(purity 99.99%) at 1 atml for 4 h in a preparation chamber 
directly connected to the analysis chamber. Samples were 
cooled to room temperature before evacuating the hydrogen. 
1 Torr = 101 325/760 Pa. 
1 
1 atm = 101 
325 Pa. 
Since CeO, is a strong insulator, spectra were recorded both 
with and without a flood gun to compensate for the positive 
charge created by the photoelectron emission process. It was 
established that a broadening of the spectra occurs and that 
some supplementary reduction also occurs (as 
determined by 
the curve-fitting analysis) when spectra were recorded 
without a flood gun. Thus all spectra were recorded with 
flood gun compensation. It was also established that no 
reduction of cerium occurs when the sample is submitted to 
the X-ray flux up to 4 h. 
The binding energies corresponded to the 3d3/2 4f V" 
(V = 
valence state) state, denoted by u"', at 916.7 eV. 
After subtraction of the background contribution due to 
inelastic processes, the Ce 3d photoemission lines were deter- 
mined using a curve-fitting procedure. The experimental 
curve was approximated by a Gaussian curve and also by a 
Lorentzian curve (due to the finite life time of the core hole). 
The 
experimental 
curve 
accounted 
for 
the 
non- 
monochromatised nature of the A1-Ka emission and the 
broadening due to the electron detector. The peak was at 1.1 
eV as measured from the broadening of the 4f7/2 line of gold 
foil. The lifetime of the core hole was taken as 0.9 eV and 1.0 
eV for the 3d,,, and 3d3/, states of cerium respetively.' 
The 
background contribution B(E) was obtained by a Shirley 
function : 
B(E) = 
K 
F(E) dE 
(1) 
Jr: 
where K 
is a constant. 
The spectra were resolved using a fitting procedure with 
the different CeIV and Ce"' states as shown in Fig. 8 (later). 
The agreement between the calculated and the experimental 
spectra is satisfactory when cerium is in the IV state but 
when the cerium is reduced to the I11 state a clear discrep- 
ancy appears at the trough (890-895 eV) between the two 
main contributions. This discrepancy and further details on 
the limitations of the Ce 3d photoemission curve-fitting pro- 
cedure are discussed elsewhere.', An estimation of the 
amount of Ce'" can be obtained from the intensity of the vo 
(uo) and v' (u') lines, according to: 
Errors are estimated to be ca. f5% in the pure Ce" state 
and ca. +7% at higher reduction states [Ce"'(%) > 30%]. 
Results 
TPR 
Fig. 1 shows the hydrogen TPR curves obtained with 
Ce0,-400 and Ce0,-850 after standardisation at 673 K 
under 0, 
and cooling under argon. For Ce0,-400 [Fig. l(a)], 
after a small shoulder at 600 K, a large peak was noted at 
820 K, followed by a negative peak at 890 K, and then again 
the positive slope of another peak at T > 1100 K. For 
Ce0,-850 [Fig. l(b)], the hydrogen consumption is compara- 
tively lower. There was a small shoulder at 820 K and a 
broad peak with a maximum at T > 1100 K. 
In a separate experiment, the reaction products were 
analysed by gas chromatography using similar conditions 
(10% H2 in He, 2 K min-I). The negative peak at 890 K 
must be related to a release of CO which could result from 
the reduction of carbonates present in the bulk of the ceria 
and not eliminated by the standardisation treatment at 673 
K. This was confirmed below by the IR study. 
The peak at 820 K depends upon the B.E.T. surface area 
since the peak almost disappeared in the case of Ce0,-850 (5

FTIR 
The IR spectrum of the residual species on the standardised 
Ce0,-400 sample is shown in Fig. 2(a)-1. Hydroxyl and car- 
bonate species remained on the surface. Comparing the 
results with those obtained on Tho, l 5  and by comparing the 
peaks with those assigned to methoxy groups,I6 it is sug- 
gested that the v(0H) high-frequency band, split into two 
components at 3650 and 3634 cm-', corresponds to type I1 
species

Ce / * h c e  
and that the band at 3500 cm-' is due to tridentate OH 
groups 
H 
I 
Ce 
Type I OH groups were characterised by a band at 3710 
cm-'; they were less stable than the type I groups which 
prevented their observation when activation was performed 
at 473 K or more, as already observed on thoria." 
Below 1600 cm-', weak absorbances were noted at 1490 
(shoulder), 1468, 1380, 1356, 1073, 1013, 954, 852 and 838 
cm-'. Li et a1." observed some of these by adsorbing CO or 
CO, on CeO, activated at loo0 K. They assigned them to 
bridged, bidentate and monodentate carbonates. In our case, 
the high thermal stability and the relatively low value of the 
Av3 splitting favour polydentate carbonate formation,'8 fol- 
lowed by bulk carbonate formation, as already proposed on 
Tho,. 
The spectrum of the standardised Ce0,-850 sample [Fig. 
2(b)-1] showed bands due to type I1 OH groups only. Car- 
bonate species lead to the appearance of a weak band at 1068 
1603 
cm-' and another band close to 1330 cm-' which was diff- 
cult to detect due to the strong absorption variation of the 
sample in the 22o(r1000 cm- ' 
range. 
Standardised samples were reduced by heating for 1 h 
under pure hydrogen (P = 100 Torr), in static conditions, at 
different temperatures, followed by evacuation at the same 
temperature. Almost no change occurred up to 473 K [Fig. 
2(a)-2]. Reducing the Ce0,-400 sample at higher tem- 
peratures shifted the v(0H) bands due to type I1 OH groups 
to higher frequencies: they were situated at 3670 and 3636 
cm - ' 
(very weak) or at 3680 and 3642 cm - ' 
when reducing 
at 573 or 673 K respectively. Reduction at higher tem- 
peratures also created a broad band near 3450 cm-' super- 
imposed on that due to the tridentate OH groups; its 
intensity increased with the reduction temperature up to 673 
K [Fig. 2(a)-3]. 
Similar results were obtained on Ce0,-850 by treatment 
with H, up to 673 K [Fig. 2(b)-3]. After reducing at 873 K 
only one sharp v(0H) band appeared at 3658 cm-' 
whereas 
that at 3450 cm-' was less intense but broadened towards 
lower wavenumbers down to 3200 cm-' [Fig. 2(b)-4]. The 
latter band partly persisted after reducing at 1073 K, in con- 
trast to the sharp band which disappeared [Fig. 2(b)-5]. 
Treatment at such a high temperature led to the appearance 
of a new broad, strong band, at ca. 3620 cm-' [Fig. 2(b)-5]. 
Shifts in the wavenumber of the type I1 OH groups showed 
that changes in the ceria surface state occur when reducing at 
T 2 
473 K, which corresponded to the beginning of the 
reduction, as observed from magnetic susceptibility measure- 
ments (see below). At temperatures > 
473 K, the hydrogen 
dissociated and led to the formation of supplementary OH 
groups characterised by the broad band at 3450 cm-'. This 
could be assigned either to hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl 
groups as shown by Li et uZ.,' 
or to water formation. H,O 
adsorption on CeO, shows that molecularly adsorbed water 
is desorbed at temperatures < 473 K. Under our experimen- 
tal conditions, it was therefore impossible to detect water 
itself since after reduction, the samples had been evacuated at 
the reduction temperature. We therefore assign the 3450 
cm- ' band to hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups resulting 
from H, dissociation. The observation of these groups even 
after treatment at 873 K or higher suggests that some of them 
could be internal groups. 
The broad, strong band at 3620 cm-' observed when 
reducing Ce0,-850 by H, at 1073 K does not correspond to 
hydroxyl groups since it is not sensitive to the change of H, 
into D, . Moreover, it persists after evacuation at 1073 K. We 
assign this band to an electronic transition, as already pro- 
posed on ZnO.,' Such an assignment is confirmed by the 
effect of the introduction of 0, at room temperature; as soon 
as 0, is introduced on the sample reduced at 1073 K, the 
3620 cm- ' 
band disappears. 
Bands due to the carbonate species were slightly modified 
by reduction by H,. For instance, those near 1490, 1375 and 
855 cm-' tended to increase in intensity when the reduction 
temperature is >473 K. This was due to a change in the state 
of the environment of the polydentate carbonate species. Of 
more significance was the appearance of a band at 2127 
cm 
- ', 
observed on Ce0,-850 after reducing at temperatures 
> 
873 K [Fig. 2(b)-4 
and 5). Introduction of 0, at room tem- 
perature on such samples caused the 2127 cm-' band to dis- 
appear while bands due to polydentate carbonates increased 
in intensity [Fig. 2(b)-6]. This allowed the establishment of a 
relation between the 2127 cm-' band and the carbonate 
species. 
The 2127 cm-' band was assigned to occluded CO, 
resulting from a partial reduction of the carbonates. On 
Ce0,-850, reduced at high temperature, the 2127 cm- ' 
band

showing that CO desorption then occurred. This was in 
agreement with the TPR results which showed CO desorp- 
tion at 890 K on CeO2-400 whereas CO desorption did not 
occur on Ce0,-850. 
UV-VIS Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy 
Allen et  1 .  '  
reported the appearance of a band at 17000 
cm-' due to a Ce@)-Ce(Iv) 
interaction when ceria was 
reduced by H, . 
Fig. 3 shows that it occurred when CeO, was 
heated under H, at temperatures >473 K. Its intensity 
notably increased at 573 K and 673 K in the case of 
CeO2-400 [Fig. 3(a)]. However, the band was hardly notice- 
able on Ce0,-850 at such reduction temperatures, heating at 
973 K under H, being necessary to make it strong in this 
case. However, its intensity depended on the reduction time 
as shown in Fig. 3(b). The addition of oxygen at room tem- 
perature completely eliminated the band, in both ceria 
samples. 
The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band appeared to vary 
with the reduction state of the ceria since the results are com- 
pletely in agreement with those reported below, obtained 
from magnetic susceptibility measurements.

Gravimetric and magnetic Susceptibility Measurements 
Reduction ofCe0,-400 by Hydrogen 
When the standardised sample was put under hydrogen flow 
at room temperature, a slight increase of mass was detected 
and due to buoyancy and flow effects, it was difficult to 
deduce the actual quantity of H, adsorbed on the sample. In 
the susceptibility experiments, no change was observed even 
after 20 h. 
The CeO, sample was heated in a stream of hydrogen up 
to 673 K with incremental steps of 50 K. The heating rate 
was 4 K min-'. At each temperature, the sample was held for 
2 h before being cooled to 294 K for measurement of the 
magnetic susceptibility, this always being carried out under 
H,. The maximum temperature was kept to 673 K in order 
to avoid textural modifications. A mass loss was observed for 
temperatures higher than 473-523 K, in agreement with the 
results of Fierro et aL3 This was due to the elimination of 
water molecules resulting from the reduction of ceria accord- 
ing to the reaction: 
(3) 
Thus, the reduction percentages could be deduced from the 
values of the mass losses. However the calculations were 
erroneous since some of the hydroxyl groups remain attached 
to the solid at the reduction temperature. For example, after 
2 h of reduction at 623 K, 230 pmol (H,O) g-' were 
desorbed from the sample by heating under vacuum at 673 
K. FTIR spectroscopy has also shown the high thermal sta- 
bility of some hydroxyls [v(OH) = 3450 cm- '1. Furthermore, 
at higher temperatures, the mass losses include the reduction 
of the carbonates species, as verified by the analysis of CH, 
and CO in the reaction products. It was concluded that 
gravimetric measurements alone cannot give a correct esti- 
mate of the degree of reduction and therefore, the Ce3+ ion 
content. 
In the magnetic susceptibility experiments, no change 
occurred below 423 K. The first increase was observed after 
the treatment at 473 K. After the reduction at 673 K, the 
value of x at 294 K was 2.36 x lop6 
emu g-'. To calculate 
the corresponding percentage reduction according to eqn. (3), 
we assumed that Ce203 
was paramagnetic and obeyed the 
Curie-Weiss law:

where x is the specific susceptibility, C is the Curie constant, 
p is the magnetic moment of the Ce3+ ion, i.e. 2.5 pB, M is 
the molecular mass of CeO,., and 6 is the Weiss temperature. 
The latter was determined experimentally on two different 
ceria samples reduced, at 673 and 10oO K, respectively by 
plotting the reciprocal susceptibility against temperature. The 
plots were nearly linear and 6 was found to be ca. -160. 
Thus the susceptibility of Ce203 can be expressed by 
x = 
4.8 x 10-3/(T + 160). 
This expression was used to calcu- 
late the reduction percentages from the susceptibility data 
obtained at the actual reduction temperature. Fig. 4(a) 
shows 
the variation of reduction percentage with temperature. The 
reduction began at 473 K and increased with temperature. It 
reached a plateau at around 700 K, the reduction level being 
close to 25%. The degrees of reduction calculated from the 
values of x at 294 K and after cooling the sample to room 
temperature differed from the previous one only by a few 
percent. This verifies the validity of the susceptibility equa- 
tion used. It also indicates that, in the reaction conditions, 
the reduction state of ceria is not greatly modified by cooling 
the sample under H, .

 Ce0,-850 by Hydrogen 
The results obtained on Ce0,-850 are shown in Fig. 4(b). 
The 
reduction process began at 473 K, as for Ce0,-400 but with 
a slow rate (2.8% reduction at 673 K). A sharp increase was 
noted at ca. 750 K, followed by a plateau at ca. 900 K for 
3536% reduction. The corresponding formal composition is 
CeO1.82

Influence o
f
 the Isothermal Reduction Time 
By calculating the number of ions present at the surface using 
a cubic model,' one can estimate that a reduction limited 
only to the surface would lead to a 20% reduction extent for 
Ce0,-400 (1 
15 m2 g- ', 
including microporosity) and 1 
YO 
for 
Ce0,-850 (5 m2 g-'). These values are not very different 
from those obtained at 650 K, i.e. 25 and 3%, respectively. 
This may suggest that at this temperature, the reduction is 
limited to the surface without major bulk reduction. To verify 
this, we studied the reduction process on CeO2-400 as before, 
but holding each intermediate temperature for 20 h. The 
results are given in Fig. 4(c). We observe that the extent of the 
reduction exceeds that of the surface without an inflexion 
point in the curve. There is a plateau at 673 K (32%) which 
corresponds to the composition CeO,.,, . 
These results indi- 
cate that for this high-surface-area ceria, there is not a clear

Study o
f
 the Reduced Phase by Thermodesorption under 
Vacuum 
Ce0,-400 reduced at 673 K (CeO,.,,) was put under vacuum 
at 673 K and then thermodesorbed up to 1030 K (8 K 
min- '). As shown in Fig. 5 the analysed products were H,O, 
H, and CO, with maxima at 780, 840 and 850 K, respec- 
tively. The mass loss was 1.2 mg g- ', 
which corresponded to 
26 pmol (CO) g-', 26 pmol (H,O) g-' and ca. 3 pmol (H,) 
g-', This quantity of hydrogen is low but detectable. Note 
that 42 pmol (CO,) g-' were desorbed from standardised 
Ce0,-400 at ca. 810 K. Thus we can assume that some of the 
polydentate carbonate species were partially hydrogenated 
during the reduction at 673 K, to give intermediates which 
further decomposed into CO and H,O. 
Oxygen Adsorption on the Reduced Samples 
Oxygen adsorption was carried out at room temperature on 
Ce0,-400 reduced to the formal CeO,.,, 
composition as 
determined by magnetic susceptibility. Increasing pressures of 
oxygen were introduced and the susceptibility was measured 
for each equilibrium value of the adsorbed oxygen. Most of 
the oxygen was adsorbed at low pressure 
lo-' Torr). 
The saturation was observed for pressures around 10 Torr 
and the adsorbed mass corresponded to 360 pmol (0,) 
g-', 
the value being 350 pmol (0,) 
for complete reoxidation. At 
294 K, no desorption was detected when the sample was put 
under vacuum. 
Fig. 6 shows the variation of the susceptibility us. the num- 
ber of 0, chemisorbed molecules. The variation is linear. The 
corresponding slope is -6.4 x 
emu mol-' 0,. This 
value is slightly lower than the theoretical one (-7.3 x 
obtained for the chemisorption of one oxygen atom per two 
Ce3+ ions. It could indicate that some excess oxygen was 
adsorbed. 
This excess oxygen was confirmed by a thermodesorption 
experiment under vacuum up to 673 K (Fig. 7). The main 
peak was CO,, with two additional peaks of 0, (383 K) and 
H,O (583 K). The excess oxygen was also revealed by a small 
reduction peak at 408 K detected during a TPR on a reoxi- 
dized Ce0,-400 sample. This could correspond to a para- 
magnetic superoxide species 0; as shown by EPR23*24 
or

more probably to peroxide species 0;- 
which were observed 
recently by FTIR after adsorption on partially reduced 
ceria.' 
These species are diamagnetic. Their desorption 
would result in no significant change of the magnetic suscep- 
tibility, which was effectively observed in our conditions. 
However, the IR study was unable to detect this species on 
our samples. Compared with the initial Ce02-400 
sample, the 
maximum for the CO, peak at 653 K indicates that the 
reduction-reoxidation processes lead to less stable carbonate 
species. The origin of the water desorption at 583 K is less 
certain. One may suppose that it comes from the oxidation of 
hydrogen retained in the ceria, as shown above. 
In the case of Ce0,-850. reduced at 970 K to CeO,.,,, the 
adsorption of oxygen at room temperature also results in 
complete oxidation of the Ce3+ ions. That means that the 
reoxidation process does not depend on the texture of the 
initial ceria.

Fig. 8 Ce 3d photoemission of a mixture of Ce" and Ce"' peaks. 
Peaks denoted by the subscripts v and u are assigned to 3d,,, and

states, respectively. The fitting procedure (

exhibits 
both CeIV 
(v, v", vm,

assignment of these lines, see text 
v n - 2  and 3d9 4f V"- CeIV 
final states and v"' to the 3d9 4f" 
V" Ce"' final state. V" represents the full valence band which 
corresponds here to 0 2p6. The occurrence of 4f1 V"-' and 
4f? VNp2 
final states was due to a lowering of the f states to 
screen the core hole created during the photoemission 
process. As clearly seen at the end of the reduction process, 
the appearance of vo (poorly resolved from the v line) and v' 
lines is associated with Ce''' states. They were assigned to 3d9 
4f2 V"-' and 3d9 4f' V" Ce"' final states, respectively, as with 
the Ce" states, the creation of a 3d9 core hole results in a 
lowering of the binding energy of the more localized 4f states. 
When they were assigned to the 3d&, 4f" V" Ce"' state at 
916.7 eV, the binding energies of the Ce 3d,/2 lines, as deter- 
mined by the curve-fitting procedure, were 880.6 & 0.5, 
882.3 f 
0.2, 885.2 & 0.3; 888.6 & 0.3 and 898.1 & 0.2 eV for 
the vo, v, v', v" and v'" states, respectively, which are in good 
agreement with reported literature data.3
