We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts. We studied in
detail titania doped with Au and used CO oxidation as a test of the oxidizing power of the system. We show that doping with Au,
Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts.
These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts.

1. Introduction
Recent experiments suggest that doped oxides may be
a new class of oxidation catalysts. Fu et al. [1,2] examined
the watergas shift reaction,CO  H2O $ CO2  H2,
catalyzed by Au or Pt supported on ceria (CeO2), and
presented evidence that catalysis is performed by Au or Pt
positive ions, not the Au or Pt nanoparticles. Other
papers show that a catalyst consisting of Au ions on ceria
[3,4], magnesia [5], alumina [6], or iron oxide [7], oxidize
CO more efficiently than the neutral metal clusters on the
same supports. Experiments [811] also show that the
perovskite LaFe0.95Pd0.05O3 is a better automotive
catalyst
than
the
Pdmetal
clusters
supported
on
alumina. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measure-
ments indicate that, under oxidative conditions, Pd is
present only as Pd2+ and Pd3+
. Several other doped
perovskites were shown to have good catalytic activity.
X-ray scattering measurements suggest [2,4,811] that
the active catalyst is a doped oxide with the chemical
formulaM1xNxOy, where M and N are cations. If this is
a general feature, these metal-doped oxides may provide
a new class of promising catalysts. First, they contain
less metal than catalysts consisting of supported metal
clusters; when expensive metals are used, this is a con-
siderable advantage. Second, in some cases, the catalyst
resists sintering better than the supported metallic par-
ticles [811]. Finally, a catalytic center consisting of one
ion is likely to be more sensitive to its environment than
a metal cluster containing thousands of atoms; it is
therefore more likely that its activity can be tuned by
changing M and N.
Given the complexity of these systems the experi-
mental observations are not absolutely conclusive, even
though taken together they provide strong circumstan-
tial evidence. It is therefore useful to use theory to
examine the possibility that doped oxides are good
oxidation catalysts and to understand the mechanism
through which such catalysis proceeds.
We use density functional theory (DFT) to show that
doping weakens greatly the bond of surface oxygen to
the oxide, making it more reactive. We have examined
rutile TiO2(110) doped with Au, Cu, Ag, Pt, Pd, and Ni
and CeO2(111) doped with gold. We present here the
results forAuxTi1xO2, as a model oxide and CO oxi-
dation as a test reaction. CO oxidation by neutral Au
particles supported on various oxides was studied
extensively both experimentally and theoretically [12
15]. However, we are not aware of any theoretical study
of CO oxidation by a doped oxide. We have selected
TiO2(110) because it is a widely used support and we
wanted to see if the experimental observations made on
ceria are valid for other oxides.
2. Computational details
We have performed periodic spin-unrestricted DFT
calculations by using a generalized gradient approxi-
mation [16,17] and the VASP program [1821]. The
ionic cores were described by scalar relativistic ultrasoft
pseudopotentials [22] allowing 6, 10 and 11 valence
electrons for O, Ti, and Au atoms, respectively. The
cutoffin the plane wave expansion was 396 eV. We
sampled the Brillouin zone at the G-point only and
allowed fractional occupancy of the bands using the
Gaussian smearing method and a window of 0.05 eV.

Monopole, dipole and quadrupole corrections to the
energy were taken into account using a modified version
of the method proposed by Makov and Payne [23]. The
pure and doped TiO2(110) surface were modeled by a
[3  2] supercell and a vacuum space of 17 A
 . All the
structures were completely relaxed except the bottom
triple-layer of TiO2(110), which was kept fix to the bulk
position. Many starting structures, corresponding to the
adsorption of O2, CO, and CO2 on a stoichiometric and
on a reduced doped rutile TiO2(110) surface, have been
fully optimized without symmetry constraints by using a
conjugated gradient algorithm [24]. The transition states
were located using the nudged elastic band method [25].
3. Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction measurements, performed on the
gold-doped ceria, have shown that the CeO2 lattice is
slightly expanded, which suggest that Au substitutes a Ce
ion [1,2,4]. The same observation holds for Pd-doped
LaFeO3 perovskite [11]. Given this information, we
decided to study a system in which a Au atom substitutes
a Ti one.
We have calculated the energy of a series of 15 layers
(5 triple-layers) TiO2(110) slabs with Au substituting a
five-coordinated (5c-Ti) or a six-coordinated Ti (6c-Ti)
atom in the first, second or third atomic layer. The slab
in which Au substitutes a 5c-Ti atom in the surface layer
(figure 1a) has the lowest energy; the energy of the
others is higher by at least 1.4 eV. Because of this, we
have studied only the catalytic activity of the slab in
which Au substitutes a 5c-Ti atom in the surface layer of
a 12 layers (4 triple-layers) TiO2(110) slab [26].
To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a
better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calcu-
lated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the
oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer
and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase. The
oxygen atoms 1 and 2 are bridging oxygens and 3 to 6
are in-plane oxygens (see figure 1a). For the Au-doped
surface,
the
values
of
Evf
are
1.57 eV(O1),
1.92 eV(O2), 2.05 eV(O3), 2.43 eV(O4), 2.58 eV(O5),
and 2.62 eV(O6). For the stoichiometric, undoped
rutile TiO2(110), Evf of the bridging oxygen is 3.7 eV
and that of the in-plane oxygen is 4.8 eV. Doping
weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to
the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au
in the slab sub layer (not shown). We obtained very
similar results forAuxCe1xO2 [27]. Moreover, doping
TiO2 with Pt, Pd, Cu, Ni and Ag weakens the bond of
the surface oxygen to the oxide even more than
doping with Au (see table 1).
It may seem strange that Cu or Ni are capable of
weakening the bond of the surface oxygen to the oxide,
more than Au, even though the Cu and Ni oxides are
more stable than those of Au (Cu and Ni have higher
affinity for oxygen than Au). This happens for several
reasons. First, Cu and Ni are not capable of making
compounds with the formal charge of 4+ and the
oxygen surrounding them (when they are dopants) see
an electron deficit, which weakens their ability to bond.
In addition, the dopantoxygen coordination is that of
TiO2 and this is different from that in Ni, Cu or Au
oxides. This is likely to affect strongly the manner in
which the dopant bonds to the oxygen. Finally, an
additional cause for change in the binding energy is the
change in the size of the ion, as compared to that of Ti.
Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a
stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a
neutral Au cluster on it. On the pure TiO2(110) surface,
Evf is larger than the exothermicity of the CO2 forma-
tionCO  1=2O2 ! CO2
and
the
clean
TiO2(110)
surface does not oxidize CO at low temperature [28]. On
the other hand, CO oxidation by using any one of the four
oxygen atoms of theAuxTi1xO2 surface is exothermic; on
this surface CO oxidation is thermodynamically favored.
On the AuxTi1xO2(110), CO binds most strongly to
the oxygen atoms most weakened by the presence of
gold, and forms an adsorbed CO2 molecule (see fig-
ure 1b). The desorption energies of the CO2 formed by
CO binding to the oxygens O1, O2, and O3, are 0.2, 0.3,
and 0.1 eV, respectively.
While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce
the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because
it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have
a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the
oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption. Because of
this, we examine oxygen chemistry on the Au-doped
TiO2 next. There are a lot of similarities between the
adsorption of O2 on a pure and Au-doped TiO2(110)
surface. In both cases, O2 adsorbs only on the reduced
surface (i.e., having oxygen vacancies), prefers to bind at
the location of a missing bridging oxygen (see figure 1d),
and its dissociation (after adsorption) is endothermic.
However, O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen
vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a
pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV).
After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with
gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a
very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This
complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind
an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the
surface to its initial state, which means that this set of
reactions is catalytic.
Some experiments find that the doped oxide catalyst
is reduced by CO to form neutral gold. Others find that
the system is stable [1,2]. The stability of the doped
oxide depends on the method of preparation and the
composition of the reacting gases [1,2]. Our calculations
shed some light on the possible mechanism of Au
reduction
during
the
reaction.
After
the
surface
oxygen 1 is removed, the surface oxygen 2 can react with
CO, to form a CO2 molecule, which desorbs from the

tien and H. Metiu/Density functional study of the CO oxidation

surface,
leaving
behind
a
second
bridging-oxygen
vacancy. The latter process is exothermic by 0.79 eV.
We propose that removing two oxygen atoms from the
surface facilitates the conversion of the ion to a neutral
Au atom. Since the neutral atoms on oxide surfaces are
mobile, it is likely that they will migrate on the surface
and form gold clusters. This suggests that stability is
achieved if the annihilation (the oxidation) of the
vacancy formed by the removal of oxygen one is faster
than the formation of a vacancy by removal of oxygen 2.
Experiments show that this balance is achieved when the
watergas shift reaction [1,2] or CO oxidation [4] is
performed on Au-doped ceria.
Table 1 shows that doping titania with copper pro-
duces the greatest weakening of the oxygenoxide bond.
This does not necessarily mean that CuxTi1xO2 is the
best oxidation catalyst. A good catalyst in this class
must strike a balance between the ability to donate an
oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxy-
gen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy
formed by the oxidation reaction. One may presume
that a dopant that makes it very easy to remove oxygen,

energies, DE, are computed relative to the sum of the energies of AuxTi1xO2, one O2 and two CO molecules. Nudge-elastic band calculations [25]
indicate that the desorption energy of CO2 is the only contribution to the activation energies reported here.

tien and H. Metiu/Density functional study of the CO oxidation

will slow down the annihilation of the oxygen vacancy.
Moreover, a too rapid removal of the oxygen atoms will
compromise the stability of the catalyst, by formation of
neutral dopant atoms. A good oxidation catalyst in this
class of compounds requires a fine balance between the
rate of oxide reduction and oxidation.
We conclude with a note of caution regarding the
accuracy of GGA-DFT calculations for oxide chemis-
try. The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism
proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of
the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface
layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen
vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen
vacancy site. It is well known that density functional
theory does not describe correctly the electronic struc-
ture of transition metal and rare-earth oxides. Theory
predicts that these compounds are metals, while exper-
iments
show
them
to
be
antiferromagnetic
Mott
insulators. The error is caused by the electron self-
interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of
the electron in the d- or f-bands where the electron
should be localized on individual atoms. When an
oxygen vacancy is created, two electrons that used to be
tied up up in the metaloxygen bond are left behind in
the vacancy. If the Kohn-Sham states created by
vacancy formation consist of hybrids involving narrow
d- or f-bands, it is likely that DFT will spread the
electrons left behind around the vacancy, rather than
localize them on the metal ion to diminish its charge
(e.g., to turn two Ti4+ ions into Ti3+). A similar effect is
suspected when we replace an ion of the host oxide with
an ion of different charge. In the case when the dopant
has a lower charge than the ions of the host (e.g., Au3+
replacing Ti4+ in TiO2) the oxygen atoms surrounding
the dopant see an electron deficit (a hole). DFT will
tend to spread this hole among several atoms, while a
correct theory might tend to localize it on one of the
oxygen atoms (forming a system that a chemist would
formally describe as Au3  O). A thorough analysis
of a similar situation can be found in an excellent paper
by Pacchioni et al.[29]. At this time it is not clear whe-
ther these errors in the nature of the Kohn-Sham states
cause substantial errors in binding energies. After all,
these states are only supposed to provide the correct
density and, strictly speaking, were not meant to
describe the electronic structure. There are many
examples in which the Kohn-Sham states give the wrong
band gap but describe, nevertheless, adsorbate binding
energies correctly. As far as the present study is con-
cerned, we note that our qualitative conclusions will not
change even if the numerical values provided by DFT
are offby 0.5 eV or more. In spite of the uncertainty
surrounding the GGA method, we believe that three of
our qualitative conclusions are fairly safe: (1) Doped
oxides are an interesting class of oxidation catalyst,
worth exploring by experiments; (2) The oxidation takes
place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism; (3) Conclu-
sions based on energy differences (such as a TiO2 doped
with Cu is easier to reduce than when doped with Au)
are likely to be correct. While the accuracy of the DFT
for the processes described here deserves further study,
we believe that GGA-DFT results can be used for ask-
ing qualitative questions that do not rely on obtaining
accurate values for the energies.
