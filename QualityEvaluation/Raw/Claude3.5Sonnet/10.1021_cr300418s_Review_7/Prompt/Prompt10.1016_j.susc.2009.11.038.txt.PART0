There is a general desire to improve the configuration of industrial catalysts to take advantage of the
intrinsic properties of metal oxides. In recent years, a series of studies has been published examining
the growth of oxide nanoparticles on metal substrates. These studies have revealed structures for the
supported oxide which are different from those found in bulk phases. In addition, the oxide M metal
interactions can alter the electronic states of the oxide producing new chemical properties. On an inverse
oxide/metal catalyst, the reactants can interact with defect sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites,
and the metaloxide interface. In these systems, one can couple the special reactivity of the oxide nano-
particles to the reactivity of the metal to obtain high catalytic activity. Furthermore, an oxide/metal sys-
tem is also an attractive model for fundamental studies. It can be used to investigate the role of the oxide
in a catalytic process, and how the stability of different reaction intermediates depends on the nature of
the oxide.

Studies of metal oxide catalysts have widely increased in recent
years due to the important role that these materials play in indus-
trial catalytic processes for the conversion of hydrocarbons, the
control of environmental pollution and the synthesis of fuels [1].
Furthermore, a very large number of industrial catalysts consist
of metal particles dispersed over an oxide support [2,3]. In these
systems, the oxide can behave as simple template for the disper-
sion of the metal or it can participate directly into the catalytic pro-
cess [13]. There is a general desire to improve the configuration of
industrial catalysts to take advantage of the intrinsic properties of
metal oxides and achieve a better performance [1,4]. Oxide nano-
particles can exhibit unique physical and chemical properties due
to their size and a high density of defects and corner or edge sur-
face sites [5]. What happens when nanoparticles of a given metal
oxide are deposited on the surface of a metal? Recently, inverse
model catalysts of CeOx nanoparticles supported over Au(1 1 1)
or Cu(1 1 1) have shown a high catalytic performance in the
watergas shift reaction (H2O + CO ? H2 + CO2), up to the point
that a CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) system is more active than Cu/CeO2(1 1 1)
and Cu/ZnO(000
1) surfaces [6,7]. As shown in Fig. 1, an inverse
oxide/metal catalyst exposes oxide nanoparticles to the reactants.
Defect sites present in the oxide are not covered by metal particles,
as in the case of a traditional metal/oxide catalyst [8]. On the in-
verse oxide/metal catalyst, the reactants can interact with defect
sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites, and the metaloxide
interface. The oxide/metal system is an attractive model to inves-
tigate the role of the oxide in a catalytic process, and also can be
used to study reaction mechanisms in detail.
Oxide/metal systems have been around in surface science for a
long time [9,10]. The application of surface science techniques are
limited when working with oxide single crystals [8]. Since oxides
can be insulators, the possibility of sample charging puts serious
constraints on the application of electron- and ion-based charac-
terization techniques. This problem is less critical for ultra-thin
films grown on conductive single crystal substrates [8,11,12]. Thus,
many studies have been published investigating the growth of
Al2O3, SiO2, MgO, TiO2, V2O3, Cr2O3, Fe3O4, FeO, CoO, NiO, MoO3
and CeO2 on metal substrates [5,8,1113]. In several cases, these
studies have revealed structures for the supported oxide which
are different from those found in bulk phases [5,7,8,11,1316]. Fur-
thermore, the oxide M metal interactions can alter the electronic
states of the oxide producing new chemical properties [12]. As
we will see below, the special properties of an oxide/metal inter-
face can be used to improve or tune the activity of a catalyst.
Due to its ability to undergo a facile conversion between 4+
and 3+ oxidation states, ceria has unique applications in the field
of heterogeneous catalysis [17,18]. The deposition of ceria nano-
particles and films has been studied on close packed metal surfaces
of Ni [19], Cu [7,20,21], Rh [14,22], Ru [19,23,24], Pd [25], Re [26],
Pt [15,27,28], and Au [6,16]. Well-ordered films were characterized
at the atomic scale with STM in the cases of Cu(1 1 1) [7,21],
Ru(0 0 0 1) [24], Rh(1 1 1) [14,22], Pt(1 1 1) [27,28], and Au(1 1 1)
[6,16]. Substantial differences between the lattice constants of

the closed packed surfaces of ceria and the metals listed above
seem to play a minor role in the growth of the ordered oxide over-
layer. At the submonolayer level, the morphology, composition and
reactivity of the ceria nanoparticles depends on the experimental
conditions used for their preparation: oxidation of Ce overlayers
or surface alloys, codeposition of Ce and O2, and reaction of Ce with
multilayers of H2O or NO2 supported on a metal [6,7,1416,19,
24,27].
Fig. 2 shows STM images obtained after depositing ceria nano-
particles on Au(1 1 1) using two different procedures [6,16]. In pa-
nel 2A, the oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by exposing a Ce/
Au(1 1 1) alloy surface to O2 gas at 450 K. There is a random distri-
bution of the ceria nanoparticles on the terraces of the gold
substrate which maintains its characteristic herringbone recon-
struction [16]. The particles occupy specific sites with respect to
the dislocation ridges of the reconstruction [6,16]. One can see large
elongated particles with an aspect ratio (mean length/mean width)
of >3. The surface of these ceria nanoparticles is quite rough. In
panel 2B, Ce atoms were vapor-deposited under an atmosphere of
O2 at 550 K. This led to an exclusive decoration of steps (see arrows
in Fig. 2B) by individual crystalline islands of distorted hexagonal
shape that are flat and about 30 nm across [16]. The islands seem
to grow from the lower step edges; although they are locally
embedded in steps their interaction with gold is not strong since
the herringbone pattern on the terraces is preserved. The first layer
may be a double layer [OCeO  OCeO/Au] of CeO2 with a
typical 0.31 nm distance between equivalent layers of (1 1 1)
planes. However, additional layers grow in increments of 0.23 nm
instead of 0.31 nm and this discrepancy may reflect the electronic
structure differences between the metallic gold step height used
as topographical reference and the height of the oxide islands
[16]. Atomically resolved images showed an oxygen-terminated
surface of CeO2(1 1 1) with oxygen vacancies [6,16].
STM images indicate that ceria also grows on Rh(1 1 1) forming
ordered CeO2(1 1 1) islands, with their (1 1 1) faces parallel and
orientationally aligned to the main azimuthal directions of the sub-
strate [14]. Strain caused by the mismatch between the lattices of
the oxide and metal facilitated the formation of O vacancies in cer-
ia [22]. A similar phenomenon probably occurs in the CeO2/
Au(1 1 1) and CeO2/Cu(1 1 1) systems [6,7]. After dosing Ce
Cu(1 1 1) under an atmosphere of O2 [7], the copper is oxidized
to Cu2O and, on top of this oxide, one sees two types of ceria fea-
tures (Fig. 3). Small islands of ceria (25 nm in size, CeOx-I) appear
on the terraces of the copper substrate, whereas large islands of
ceria (3050 nm in size, triangular shape, CeOx-II) are embedded
in the substrate step edges. Inside the large ceria islands, one can
see a moir pattern with a separation of 5 nm in between the
depressions [7]. The large ceria islands have a structure different
from that seen for the two most stable surfaces of bulk ceria:
CeO2(1 1 1) and CeO2(1 1 0). The oxide nanoparticles in ceria/
Cu(1 1 1) display a morphology quite different from that found
for the growth of ceria nanoparticles on a Au(1 1 1) substrate using
the same deposition methodology [6]. The interactions of the cop-
per substrate with the ceria nanoparticles are much stronger
allowing the existence of small oxide nanoparticles on terraces of
the surface (CeOx-I) and forcing a unique morphology on the large
oxide particles (CeOx-II).
CeO2 nanoparticles deposited on Rh(1 1 1) [22], Pt(1 1 1) [15],
Cu(1 1 1) [7] and Au(1 1 1) [6] are much easier to reduce than ex-
tended surfaces of bulk CeO2. Oxygen vacancies can be produced
by annealing the supported ceria nanoparticles in vacuum at ele-
vated temperatures [22,15] or by direct reaction with CO or H2
[6,7]. Nanoparticles of TiO2, Cr2O3, MoO3, and NiO supported on
metals are also easier to reduce than the corresponding bulk
phases of the oxides [5,6,11,13,29]. The reducibility of the oxide/
metal systems can be an important property since many bulk oxi-
des exhibit a low reactivity and become chemically active only
after the generation of O vacancies [30]. Thus, in the oxide/metal
systems one could couple the special reactivity of the oxide nano-
particles to the reactivity of the metal to obtain highly active
catalysts.
Au(1 1 1) cannot dissociate water and, therefore, is not able to
catalyze the watergas shift (WGS) reaction [6,31]. Density-func-
tional (DF) calculations predict a very high barrier (>1 eV) for the
dissociation of water on Au(1 1 1) [31]. Once the OH groups are
formed, subsequent steps for the WGS process occur readily on
the gold substrate [31,32]. Fig. 4 displays XPS spectra obtained
after adsorbing water at 300 K on a ceria/gold system that con-
tained fully oxidized ceria nanoparticles (Ce4+) and on a system
which contained a substantial amount of Ce3+ [33]. The CeO2/

Au(1 1 1) surface was not able to dissociate water. In this respect,
it behaved like a bulk CeO2(1 1 1) surface [34]. But the CeO2/
Au(1 1 1) system can be easily reduced with CO gas [6], and in
the presence of Ce3+ cations there is a fast dissociation of water
[6,31].
Eventually,
the

nanoparticles
on
Au(1 1 1) produces an excellent WGS catalysts [6]. The same occurs
after depositing nanoparticles of TiO2 [6]. In TiO2x/Au(1 1 1) and
CeO2x/Au(1 1 1), water dissociates on O vacancies of the oxide
nanoparticles, CO adsorbs on Au sites located nearby, and subse-
quent reaction steps take place at the metaloxide interface. In
these inverse catalysts, the moderate chemical activity of bulk gold
is coupled to that of a more reactive oxide [6].
Cu(1 1 1) has become a benchmark surface for studying the
WGS reaction [3538]. Specific rates, activation energies, and reac-
tion orders are consistent with data reported for ZnO-supported Cu
catalysts [35,36]. As in the case of Au(1 1 1), the rate limiting step
for WGS on Cu(1 1 1) is the dissociation of water [3537,39]. DF
calculations indicate that the reaction is endothermic (DE = 0.2
0.6 eV) with a large activation energy (Ea = 0.91.4 eV) [37,39].
The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the
dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV)
with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV [7]. Fig. 5 shows
the WGS activities of Cu(1 1 1) and a CeOx /Cu(1 1 1) system in
which approximately 20% of the copper surface was covered by
ceria [7]. For comparison, we include results obtained under the
same conditions for Cu(1 0 0) and 0.5 ML of Cu deposited on
CeO2(1 1 1) [34]. The data were collected at temperatures of 575,
600, 625 and 650 K to construct Arrhenius plots. The CeOx nano-
particles supported on Cu(1 1 1) generated a catalyst which was
8 (at 650 K) to 23 times (at 575 K) more active than the clean
Cu(1 1 1) substrate. The WGS on Cu(1 1 1) has an apparent activa-
tion energy of 0.78 eV, which is 0.10.2 eV larger than that found
on Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(1 1 0) [35,36]. In contrast, the apparent activa-
tion energy for the WGS on CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) is only 0.31 eV. This va-
lue is also smaller than the corresponding value found for Cu
nanoparticles supported on CeO2(1 1 1), 0.39 eV [34]. Thus, CeOx/
Cu seems to be the best catalyst in terms of activity or apparent
activation energy. This is a consequence of the special chemical
properties of the ceria nanoparticles and the configuration of the
catalyst. Post-reaction surface analysis indicated that the dominant
oxidation state of cerium in the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) catalyst was 3+.
This was not the case for the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst [34], where
there were only a few O vacancies in the ceria support.
When working with conventional metal/oxide catalysts, the
major emphasis is usually in controlling the oxidation state and
morphology of the metal in the catalytic system. The oxide in many
cases is seen as an inert support. Inverse oxide/metal systems can
be used to test this hypothesis [6,7,4042]. In the case of active
oxide supports, the inverse oxide/metal systems can be a valuable
tool to study the effects of the oxide on the reaction mechanism
[6,43], and how the stability of different reaction intermediates de-
pends on the nature of the oxide. A comparison of the WGS activ-
ities of CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) [7] and Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) [34] in Fig. 5 shows
that an optimization of the physical and chemical properties of
the oxide component in a catalyst is as important as the optimiza-
tion of the properties of the metal component. For practical appli-
