An  Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst

 of  CO,  and  the effects  of
 the  formed

 were  studied  by  a pulse  calorimetry.
 A  volcano-like

 between
the

 The  presence
 of  oxygen  vacancy
is
 favorable
 for  CO  oxidation,
 with  the  best  activity  when
 1.5%  amount
 of
 oxygen  vacancy  is
 obtained.
However,
 the activity  decreases
 with  further  increase
 of oxygen
 vacancy.
 A
 quantitative
 analysis
 of  the
reaction
 process  suggests
 that the
 increase
 of  oxygen
 vacancy
 promotes
 the  buildup  of  strongly
 adsorbed
carbonates,
 leading
 to  the  prohibition
 of  the  adsorption
 and  activation
 of
 CO
 but  not  O2. The  reduced
supply
 of  adsorbed
 CO  to react  with  oxygen
 species  may  result  in  the  decreasing
 activity  with more
oxygen
 vacancy.

 Introduction
CO
 oxidation
 on
 ceria-based
 catalysts
 has
 been
 extensively
 stud-
ied
 during
 the
 past
 decades,
 due
 to
 the
 high
 capacity
 of
 ceria
 to
 store
and
 release
 oxygen
 as
 a
 reducible
 support
 [14].
 Recently,
 a
 debate
about
 the
 role
 of
 ceria
 in
 CO
 oxidation
 is
 ongoing.
 The
 reversible
 for-
mation
 of
 oxygen
 vacancy
 (Ov)
 on
 the
 activated
 ceria
 was
 thought
to
 operate
 in
 its
 catalytic
 cycle.
 The
 catalysts
 with
 noble
 metal
 (NM)
encapsulated
 by
 ceria
 can
 still
 behave
 a
 high
 activity
 even
 without
the
 direct
 participation
 of
 the
 NM
 [59].
 It
 has
 been
 proposed
 that
the
 addition
 of
 NM
 weakened
 the
 surface
 CeO
 bond
 strength
 and
promoted
 the
 formation
 of
 Ov,
 which
 became
 the
 active
 sites.
Reactive
 oxygen
 removal
 from
 ceria
 with
 formation
 of
 Ov
 is
 a
well
 known
 step
 during
 CO
 oxidation,
 concomitant
 with
 the
 tran-
sient
 CO2 formation
 [1012].  The
 presence
 of
 Ov
 was
 generally
helpful
 for
 the
 activation
 of
 O2 [13,14]. It
 was
 suggested
 that
 CO
can
 react
 with
 these
 active
 oxygen
 species
 to
 produce
 carbonates,
which
 would
 affect
 CO
 oxidation,
 either
 as
 a
 reaction-intermediate
or
 as
 a
 spectator
 staying
 steady
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 Ov
 [1518].
However,
 there
 were
 few
 studies
 to
 quantify
 the
 amount
 of
 Ov
 of
ceria-based
 catalysts
 and
 further
 correlate
 it
 with
 the
 activity
 of
 CO

 [19].
 That
 is,
 little
 attention
 was
 paid
 to
 find
 the
 optimum
Ov
 content
 of
 the
 catalyst
 in
 its
 active
 state.
Our
 previous
 work
 has
 suggested
 that
 CO
 oxidation
 progressed
on
 the
 activated
 ceria
 of
 an
 Ir-in-CeO2 sample
 (most
 of
 iridium
encapsulated
 by
 ceria)
 and
 reductive
 pretreatment
 increased
 its
activity,
 indicating
 the
 important
 role
 of
 Ov
 [9,20].
 In
 this
 study,
 we
investigated
 the
 influence
 of
 CO
 pretreatment
 on
 this
 Ir-in-CeO2
sample.
 With
 pretreatment
 by
 pulses
 of
 CO,
 different
 amounts
 of
Ov
 and
 carbonates
 were
 obtained
 and
 their
 effects
 on
 CO
 oxidation
were
 in
 turn
 studied.
 A
 volcano-like
 relationship
 between
 Ov
 and
the
 activity
 of
 CO
 oxidation
 was
 established,
 the
 reasons
 of
 which
were
 then
 investigated
 by
 analysis
 of
 the
 transient
 process
 during
CO
 oxidation.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
The
 Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst
 was
 prepared
 by
 a
 redox
 co-precipitation
method,
 as
 described
 previously
 [9].  An
 aqueous
 solution
 of
 H2IrCl6
and
 Ce(NO3)3 was
 added
 to
 a
 heated
 NaOH
 solution
 (353
 K)
 to
form
 a
 black
 precipitate.
 After
 aging
 for
 2
 h,
 the
 suspension
 was
suction
 filtered
 and
 washed
 with
 deionized
 water
 several
 times
until
 no
 Clwas
 detected
 by
 AgNO3.
 Thereafter,
 the
 solid
 mate-
rial
 was
 dried
 at
 333
 K
 overnight
 and
 finally
 calcined
 at
 673
 K
 for
2
 h.
 The
 powder
 sample
 was
 pressed,
 crushed,
 sieved
 with
 a
 size
of
 2040
 mesh
 for
 characterization.

Temperature
 programmed

 of
 CO
 (CO-TPR)
 was
 per-
formed
 in
 a
 quartz
 microreactor,
 and
 about
 100
 mg  of
 a
 sample
 was
used
 in
 each
 measurement.
 The
 calcined
 sample
 was
 pretreated
under
 He
 flow
 at
 393
 K
 for
 2
 h
 and
 then
 cooled
 down
 to
 313
 K.
The
 flow
 of
 5%
 CO
 in
 He
 (50
 mL  min1)
 was
 then
 switched
 into
the
 system
 and
 the
 sample
 was
 heated
 up
 to
 1023
 K
 at
 a
 rate
 of
3
 K
 min1.
 CO,
 CO2,
 and
 H2 in
 the
 outlet
 gas
 were
 measured
 by
 a
mass
 spectrometer
 (MS)
 OminiStar
 equipped
 with
 the
 software
quadstar
 32-bit.
 CO
 and
 H2 signals
 were
 calibrated
 by
 using
 5%
CO/He
 and
 10%
 H2/Ar,
 respectively.
 CO2 signal
 was
 calibrated
 by
a
 pulse
 of
 pure
 CO2 with
 a
 ten-port
 pulsing
 valve.
 The
 signals
 of
 CO,
H2,
 and
 CO2 evolved
 during
 the
 measurement
 were
 determined
from
 the
 MS
 and
 the
 flow
 rate
 of
 reducing
 agent.
Temperature

 of
 O2 (TPO)
 was

 The

 at
673
 K
 and
 then

 The

 at
 a
