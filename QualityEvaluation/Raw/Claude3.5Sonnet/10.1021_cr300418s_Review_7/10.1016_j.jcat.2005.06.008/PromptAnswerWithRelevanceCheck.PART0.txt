[1] "It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "Therefore an understanding of the structure and relative stability of the surfaces of CeO2 can provide useful insights closely related to catalytic reactions that normally take place on these surfaces."

[3] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cyclic process of surface reduction and oxidation. For CO oxidation on ceria, this involves:

1. CO reacting with surface oxygen, reducing the ceria surface and forming an oxygen vacancy
2. The oxygen vacancy being replenished by gas-phase oxygen, re-oxidizing the surface

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. Lower ΔEv makes it easier to form oxygen vacancies, increasing reactivity
2. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values, with {110} and {100} planes having lower ΔEv than {111} planes
3. Surfaces with lower ΔEv (e.g. {110} and {100}) are more reactive for CO oxidation
4. The relative stability and ΔEv of different surface planes follows the order: {111} > {110} > {100}

Thus, the exposure of more reactive planes with lower ΔEv values (like {100}) can enhance the catalytic activity of ceria for CO oxidation by facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and the overall redox cycle.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过表面还原和氧化的循环过程运作。对于二氧化铈上的CO氧化，这涉及：

1. CO与表面氧反应，还原二氧化铈表面并形成氧空位
2. 气相氧补充氧空位，重新氧化表面

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为：

1. 较低的ΔEv使氧空位更容易形成，从而提高反应活性
2. 不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值，其中{110}和{100}面的ΔEv低于{111}面
3. ΔEv较低的表面（如{110}和{100}）对CO氧化的反应性更强
4. 不同表面平面的相对稳定性和ΔEv遵循以下顺序：{111} > {110} > {100}

因此，暴露ΔEv值较低的更具反应性的平面（如{100}）可以通过促进氧空位的形成和整个氧化还原循环，增强二氧化铈对CO氧化的催化活性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves alternating reduction and oxidation of the oxide surface. The key steps are:

1. Formation of surface oxygen vacancies through reaction with the reducing agent (e.g. CO)
2. Replenishment of these vacancies by gas-phase oxygen

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values lead to easier vacancy formation and thus higher activity. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values, with less stable planes like {110} and {100} having lower ΔEv compared to more stable {111} planes. This makes the less stable planes more reactive for oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv is that it determines how easily the oxide can participate in the redox cycle. Lower ΔEv allows for more facile oxygen transfer from the lattice to adsorbed species, enhancing catalytic activity. It also influences the oxide's oxidizing power, as surfaces with lower ΔEv can more readily release oxygen to oxidize adsorbed molecules.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作涉及氧化物表面的交替还原和氧化。关键步骤包括：

1. 通过与还原剂（如CO）反应形成表面氧空位
2. 通过气相氧补充这些空位

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值导致更容易形成空位，从而提高活性。不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值，不稳定的面如{110}和{100}比稳定的{111}面具有更低的ΔEv。这使得不稳定的面在氧化反应中更具反应性。

ΔEv的重要性在于它决定了氧化物参与氧化还原循环的难易程度。较低的ΔEv允许晶格氧更容易转移到吸附物种上，从而增强催化活性。它还影响氧化物的氧化能力，因为具有较低ΔEv的表面可以更容易地释放氧来氧化吸附分子。

1. CO reacts with surface oxygen from the ceria, reducing the surface and forming an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then filled by gas-phase oxygen, re-oxidizing the surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values indicate:

1. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies
2. Higher catalytic activity
3. Greater oxidizing ability of the surface

Different crystal planes of ceria have varying ΔEv values, with {110} and {100} surfaces having lower ΔEv compared to {111}. This makes {110} and {100} surfaces more reactive for CO oxidation, as they can more easily form and accommodate oxygen vacancies.
