[1] "It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Mars–van Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."

[3] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cyclic process of surface reduction and oxidation. For CO oxidation on ceria:

1. CO reacts with surface oxygen from the ceria, reducing the surface and forming an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then filled by gas-phase oxygen, re-oxidizing the surface.
3. CO2 forms and desorbs, completing the cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values indicate:

1. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies
2. Higher catalytic activity
3. Greater oxidizing ability of the surface

Different crystal planes of ceria have varying ΔEv values, with {110} and {100} surfaces having lower ΔEv compared to {111}. This makes {110} and {100} surfaces more reactive for CO oxidation, as they can more easily form and accommodate oxygen vacancies.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过表面还原和氧化的循环过程来运作。对于在氧化铈上的CO氧化：

1. CO与氧化铈表面的氧反应，还原表面并形成氧空位。
2. 气相氧then填补氧空位，重新氧化表面。
3. CO2形成并脱附，完成循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对决定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表示：

1. 更容易形成氧空位
2. 更高的催化活性
3. 表面更强的氧化能力

氧化铈的不同晶面具有不同的ΔEv值，其中{110}和{100}表面比{111}具有更低的ΔEv。这使得{110}和{100}表面对CO氧化更具反应性，因为它们可以更容易地形成和容纳氧空位。
