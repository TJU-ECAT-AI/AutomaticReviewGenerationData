[1] "It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves alternating reduction and oxidation of the oxide surface. For CO oxidation on ceria, this occurs through:

1. Reaction of CO with surface oxygen, forming an oxygen vacancy
2. Replenishment of the vacancy by gas-phase oxygen

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is critical in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values correspond to easier vacancy formation and higher reactivity. For ceria, the {110} and {100} surfaces have lower ΔEv than {111} surfaces, making them more catalytically active for CO oxidation. This highlights how surface structure influences reactivity by affecting the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面的交替还原和氧化。对于二氧化铈上的CO氧化，这个过程包括：

1. CO与表面氧反应，形成氧空位
2. 气相氧填补空位

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对决定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值对应于更容易形成空位和更高的反应活性。对于二氧化铈，{110}和{100}表面的ΔEv低于{111}表面，使它们在CO氧化反应中具有更高的催化活性。这突出表明了表面结构如何通过影响Mars-van Krevelen机理中氧空位形成的能量学来影响反应活性。
