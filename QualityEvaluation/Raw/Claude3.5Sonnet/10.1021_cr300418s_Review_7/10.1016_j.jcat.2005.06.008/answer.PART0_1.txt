[1] "It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves alternating reduction and oxidation of the oxide surface. The key steps are:

1. Formation of surface oxygen vacancies through reaction with the reducing agent (e.g. CO)
2. Replenishment of these vacancies by gas-phase oxygen

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values lead to easier vacancy formation and thus higher activity. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values, with less stable planes like {110} and {100} having lower ΔEv compared to more stable {111} planes. This makes the less stable planes more reactive for oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv is that it determines how easily the oxide can participate in the redox cycle. Lower ΔEv allows for more facile oxygen transfer from the lattice to adsorbed species, enhancing catalytic activity. It also influences the oxide's oxidizing power, as surfaces with lower ΔEv can more readily release oxygen to oxidize adsorbed molecules.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作涉及氧化物表面的交替还原和氧化。关键步骤包括：

1. 通过与还原剂（如CO）反应形成表面氧空位
2. 通过气相氧补充这些空位

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值导致更容易形成空位，从而提高活性。不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值，不稳定的面如{110}和{100}比稳定的{111}面具有更低的ΔEv。这使得不稳定的面在氧化反应中更具反应性。

ΔEv的重要性在于它决定了氧化物参与氧化还原循环的难易程度。较低的ΔEv允许晶格氧更容易转移到吸附物种上，从而增强催化活性。它还影响氧化物的氧化能力，因为具有较低ΔEv的表面可以更容易地释放氧来氧化吸附分子。
