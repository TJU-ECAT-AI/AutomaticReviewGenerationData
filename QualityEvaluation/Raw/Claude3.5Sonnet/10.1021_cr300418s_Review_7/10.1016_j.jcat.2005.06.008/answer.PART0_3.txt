[1] "It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "It is generally accepted that the compact {111} surfaces are the most stable (and are therefore less reactive), followed by {110}, {100}, and {211}"

[3] "The different reactivity of CO with exposed surfaces of ceria is also the result of the different stabilities of exposed planes. It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."

[4] "Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of reduction and oxidation of the catalyst surface. For CO oxidation on ceria, this involves:

1. Reaction of CO with surface oxygen, reducing the ceria surface and forming an oxygen vacancy
2. Replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen, re-oxidizing the surface

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. Lower ΔEv makes it easier to form oxygen vacancies, increasing reactivity
2. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values, with {110} and {100} surfaces having lower ΔEv than {111} surfaces
3. Surfaces with lower ΔEv (like {110} and {100}) are more reactive for CO oxidation
4. The relative stability/reactivity of surfaces follows the order: {111} > {110} > {100}

Thus, ΔEv directly influences which surfaces are most catalytically active, with lower ΔEv corresponding to higher activity but lower stability. This explains why exposing more {100} and {110} surfaces can enhance the catalytic performance of ceria for CO oxidation.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过催化剂表面的还原和氧化循环来运作。对于二氧化铈上的CO氧化，这包括：

1. CO与表面氧反应，还原二氧化铈表面并形成氧空位
2. 气相氧补充氧空位，重新氧化表面

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为：

1. 较低的ΔEv使氧空位更容易形成，从而提高反应活性
2. 不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值，{110}和{100}表面的ΔEv低于{111}表面
3. ΔEv较低的表面（如{110}和{100}）对CO氧化的反应性更高
4. 表面的相对稳定性/反应性顺序为：{111} > {110} > {100}

因此，ΔEv直接影响哪些表面最具催化活性，较低的ΔEv对应于较高的活性但较低的稳定性。这解释了为什么暴露更多的{100}和{110}表面可以增强二氧化铈对CO氧化的催化性能。
