<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and energy of oxygen vacancy formation are not directly discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on quantum DFT+U calculations of oxygen vacancies on the CeO2(1 1 1) surface and adsorption of O2 on these vacancies, but does not mention the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or discuss catalytic oxidation reactions in those terms. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not explicitly calculated or discussed in relation to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

The given scientific literature does not discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The document focuses on quantum modeling of surface anion vacancies and oxygen adsorption on cerium oxide (CeO2) surfaces, but does not cover the specific aspects asked about in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in the given text.

<quotes>
[1] "Cerium oxide is an important ingredient in redox catalysts active in chemical reactions such as combustion of organics, car exhaust gas cleaning, water gas shift (WGS), CO preferential oxidation (PROX), intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells or sulfur removal in FCC units [1]."

[2] "Its high redox activity is to a large extent due to its ability to easily release and retake oxygen with concomitant change of cerium from the Ce4+ redox state to the Ce3+ state and back."

[3] "From this point of view it was interesting to observe, during an atomistic simulation work [8], that anion vacancies had apparently a tendency to associate on the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2, that was predicted to be the most stable one, but not in the (1 1 0) surface, second in stability."

[4] "Computing the total energies of the most stable of these solutions, the defect-free surface and an isolated O2 molecule allows to obtain an energy balance for the vacancy formation process
Ce24O48 0V → Ce24O47 1V + 1/2O2
ΔE ≈ 2.45 eV"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide some relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation and catalytic properties of cerium oxide:

Cerium oxide is an important redox catalyst used in various oxidation reactions. Its high redox activity stems from its ability to easily release and reabsorb oxygen, switching between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states. 

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is calculated to be approximately 2.45 eV for the CeO2(111) surface. This energy is related to the ease of oxygen release, which is a key step in oxidation catalysis.

While the literature doesn't directly address how ΔEv affects catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, it suggests that the relatively low energy for vacancy formation contributes to cerium oxide's effectiveness as a redox catalyst. The ability to readily form and heal oxygen vacancies likely facilitates the oxidation-reduction cycles involved in catalytic reactions.

The text also mentions that oxygen vacancies may tend to associate on the (111) surface, which could potentially affect the catalytic properties, though this is not explicitly stated.

该文献并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文本确实提供了一些关于氧空位形成和氧化铈催化性质的相关信息：

氧化铈是一种重要的氧化还原催化剂，用于各种氧化反应。其高度的氧化还原活性源于其易于释放和重新吸收氧的能力，在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间切换。

对于CeO2(111)表面，氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)计算约为2.45 eV。这个能量与氧释放的容易程度有关，而氧释放是氧化催化的关键步骤。

虽然文献没有直接阐述ΔEv如何影响催化活性和氧化能力，但它暗示了相对较低的空位形成能有助于氧化铈成为有效的氧化还原催化剂。容易形成和愈合氧空位的能力可能有助于催化反应中涉及的氧化还原循环。

文本还提到氧空位可能倾向于在(111)表面上聚集，这可能会影响催化性质，尽管这一点并未明确说明。
