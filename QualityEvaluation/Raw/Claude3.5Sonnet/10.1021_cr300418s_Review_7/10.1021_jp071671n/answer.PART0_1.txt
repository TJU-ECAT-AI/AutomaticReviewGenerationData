[1] "In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide."

[3] "The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through two main steps:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms on the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.

2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen, healing the vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It serves as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of an oxide. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is a better oxidant, more willing to give up oxygen to create vacancies.

2. It reflects how easily the oxide can participate in the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Lower ΔEv means the oxide can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction.

3. It indirectly influences the second step of the mechanism, as the ability to form vacancies affects the subsequent adsorption and activation of gas-phase oxygen.

In essence, ΔEv is a key indicator of an oxide's potential performance as an oxidation catalyst, with lower values generally suggesting higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过两个主要步骤运作：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。

2. 随后，还原的氧化物通过与气相氧反应重新被氧化，修复氧空位。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它作为判断氧化物氧化能力的标准。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，更容易释放氧以创造空位。

2. 它反映了氧化物参与Mars-van Krevelen机制第一步的难易程度。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物能更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。

3. 它间接影响机制的第二步，因为形成空位的能力影响随后气相氧的吸附和活化。

本质上，ΔEv是氧化物作为氧化催化剂潜在性能的关键指标，较低的值通常表明更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。
