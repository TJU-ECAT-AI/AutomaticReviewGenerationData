[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[2] "The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

[3] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

[4] "We take this to mean that one of the oxygen atoms near the dopant is much more reactive than the oxygen atoms of the pure oxide. This suggests that the doped oxides will perform oxidation reactions at lower temperatures than the undoped ones."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms at the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.
2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It serves as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.
2. Lower OVFE indicates that oxygen atoms are more reactive and can be more easily removed from the surface.
3. A lower OVFE suggests that the oxide can perform oxidation reactions at lower temperatures, indicating higher catalytic activity.
4. OVFE can be used to compare the oxidizing ability of different oxides or doped oxides, with lower values generally indicating better oxidizing ability.

By manipulating the OVFE through doping or other means, researchers can potentially enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces for various industrial applications.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过两个步骤进行：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。
2. 还原后的氧化物随后与气相氧反应重新氧化。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv或OVFE）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它作为晶格氧参与Mars-van Krevelen机理难易程度的衡量标准。
2. 较低的OVFE表明氧原子更具反应性，可以更容易地从表面移除。
3. 较低的OVFE意味着氧化物可以在较低温度下进行氧化反应，表明具有更高的催化活性。
4. OVFE可用于比较不同氧化物或掺杂氧化物的氧化能力，通常较低值表示具有更好的氧化能力。

通过掺杂或其他方法操纵OVFE，研究人员可以潜在地增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，以应用于各种工业应用。
