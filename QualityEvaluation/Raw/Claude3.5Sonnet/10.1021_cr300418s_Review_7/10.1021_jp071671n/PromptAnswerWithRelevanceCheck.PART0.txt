[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[2] "The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

[3] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

[4] "We take this to mean that one of the oxygen atoms near the dopant is much more reactive than the oxygen atoms of the pure oxide. This suggests that the doped oxides will perform oxidation reactions at lower temperatures than the undoped ones."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms at the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.
2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It serves as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.
2. Lower OVFE indicates that oxygen atoms are more reactive and can be more easily removed from the surface.
3. A lower OVFE suggests that the oxide can perform oxidation reactions at lower temperatures, indicating higher catalytic activity.
4. OVFE can be used to compare the oxidizing ability of different oxides or doped oxides, with lower values generally indicating better oxidizing ability.

By manipulating the OVFE through doping or other means, researchers can potentially enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces for various industrial applications.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过两个步骤进行：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。
2. 还原后的氧化物随后与气相氧反应重新氧化。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv或OVFE）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它作为晶格氧参与Mars-van Krevelen机理难易程度的衡量标准。
2. 较低的OVFE表明氧原子更具反应性，可以更容易地从表面移除。
3. 较低的OVFE意味着氧化物可以在较低温度下进行氧化反应，表明具有更高的催化活性。
4. OVFE可用于比较不同氧化物或掺杂氧化物的氧化能力，通常较低值表示具有更好的氧化能力。

通过掺杂或其他方法操纵OVFE，研究人员可以潜在地增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，以应用于各种工业应用。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through two main steps:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms on the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.

2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen, healing the vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It serves as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of an oxide. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is a better oxidant, more willing to give up oxygen to create vacancies.

2. It reflects how easily the oxide can participate in the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Lower ΔEv means the oxide can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction.

3. It indirectly influences the second step of the mechanism, as the ability to form vacancies affects the subsequent adsorption and activation of gas-phase oxygen.

In essence, ΔEv is a key indicator of an oxide's potential performance as an oxidation catalyst, with lower values generally suggesting higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过两个主要步骤运作：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。

2. 随后，还原的氧化物通过与气相氧反应重新被氧化，修复氧空位。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它作为判断氧化物氧化能力的标准。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，更容易释放氧以创造空位。

2. 它反映了氧化物参与Mars-van Krevelen机制第一步的难易程度。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物能更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。

3. 它间接影响机制的第二步，因为形成空位的能力影响随后气相氧的吸附和活化。

本质上，ΔEv是氧化物作为氧化催化剂潜在性能的关键指标，较低的值通常表明更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. The reactant species interacts with oxygen atoms on the oxide surface, removing them and creating oxygen vacancies. This step requires the oxide to be a good oxidant, readily giving up its surface oxygen.

2. The reduced oxide surface then adsorbs oxygen molecules from the gas phase. These adsorbed oxygen molecules are activated, with one oxygen atom going to oxidize another reactant molecule and the other healing the oxygen vacancy on the surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower OVFE indicates that surface oxygen atoms are more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant and potentially more active catalyst. The OVFE serves as a measure of how readily the lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, with lower values suggesting easier participation and potentially higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两个步骤进行：

1. 反应物与氧化物表面的氧原子相互作用，移除这些氧原子并产生氧空位。这一步要求氧化物是一个良好的氧化剂，能够容易地释放表面氧。

2. 还原后的氧化物表面随后吸附气相中的氧分子。这些吸附的氧分子被活化，其中一个氧原子用于氧化另一个反应分子，另一个氧原子则修复表面的氧空位。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv或OVFE）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面非常重要。较低的OVFE表明表面氧原子更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂和可能更活跃的催化剂。OVFE作为晶格氧参与Mars-van Krevelen机理容易程度的衡量标准，较低的值表明更容易参与，可能导致氧化反应的更高催化活性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates in two main steps:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide catalyst, creating oxygen vacancies on the surface.

2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen, restoring the catalyst.

2. It is used as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide. Lower OVFE generally correlates with higher oxidative power and potentially better catalytic performance.

3. It helps in comparing the effects of different dopants on the oxide's catalytic properties. Researchers classify dopants based on how they affect the OVFE, which provides insights into potential improvements in catalytic activity.

4. It influences the temperature at which the oxide can effectively catalyze oxidation reactions. Lower OVFE may allow reactions to proceed at lower temperatures, potentially improving energy efficiency and selectivity.

By studying how various dopants affect the OVFE of oxide catalysts, researchers can potentially design more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidation reactions.

3. It indirectly influences the second step of the mechanism, as the ease of vacancy formation affects the ability to adsorb and activate gas-phase oxygen for re-oxidation.

In summary, a lower OVFE generally indicates a more active catalyst for oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, as it facilitates both the removal of lattice oxygen and the subsequent re-oxidation of the catalyst surface.

3. 它间接影响机理的第二步，因为空位形成的容易程度影响了吸附和活化气相氧进行再氧化的能力。

总之，较低的OVFE通常表明催化剂在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中更活跃，因为它既促进了晶格氧的移除，又有利于催化剂表面的随后再氧化。
