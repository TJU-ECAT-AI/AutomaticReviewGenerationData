[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide."

[3] "To present our results we divide the dopants into five classes. This division is not rigorous and is based on the magnitude of the effect of the dopant on the OVFE."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates in two main steps:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide catalyst, creating oxygen vacancies on the surface.

2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen, restoring the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It serves as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the oxidation reaction. A lower OVFE indicates that surface oxygen is more reactive and can be more easily removed to oxidize the reactant.

2. It is used as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide. Lower OVFE generally correlates with higher oxidative power and potentially better catalytic performance.

3. It helps in comparing the effects of different dopants on the oxide's catalytic properties. Researchers classify dopants based on how they affect the OVFE, which provides insights into potential improvements in catalytic activity.

4. It influences the temperature at which the oxide can effectively catalyze oxidation reactions. Lower OVFE may allow reactions to proceed at lower temperatures, potentially improving energy efficiency and selectivity.

By studying how various dopants affect the OVFE of oxide catalysts, researchers can potentially design more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两个主要步骤运作：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子反应，在表面创造氧空位。

2. 还原后的氧化物随后与气相氧反应重新氧化，从而恢复催化剂。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或OVFE）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它作为晶格氧参与氧化反应容易程度的衡量标准。较低的OVFE表明表面氧更具反应性，可以更容易地被移除以氧化反应物。

2. 它被用作判断掺杂氧化物氧化能力的标准。较低的OVFE通常与更高的氧化能力相关，可能带来更好的催化性能。

3. 它有助于比较不同掺杂剂对氧化物催化性能的影响。研究人员根据掺杂剂如何影响OVFE来对其进行分类，这为潜在的催化活性改进提供了见解。

4. 它影响氧化物能够有效催化氧化反应的温度。较低的OVFE可能允许反应在较低温度下进行，潜在地提高能源效率和选择性。

通过研究各种掺杂剂如何影响氧化物催化剂的OVFE，研究人员可以潜在地设计出更高效和更具选择性的氧化反应催化剂。
