[1] "In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

[3] "The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through two key steps:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms on the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.

2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen, healing the vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It measures how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the oxidation reaction. A lower OVFE indicates that surface oxygen is more readily available for reaction.

2. It reflects the oxide's ability to act as a good oxidant. An oxide with lower OVFE is more willing to give up oxygen to create vacancies, which is essential for the first step of the mechanism.

3. It indirectly influences the second step of the mechanism, as the ease of vacancy formation affects the ability to adsorb and activate gas-phase oxygen for re-oxidation.

In summary, a lower OVFE generally indicates a more active catalyst for oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, as it facilitates both the removal of lattice oxygen and the subsequent re-oxidation of the catalyst surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两个关键步骤运作：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，形成氧空位。

2. 还原后的氧化物随后与气相氧反应重新氧化，修复空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或OVFE）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要，原因如下：

1. 它衡量了晶格氧参与氧化反应的难易程度。较低的OVFE表明表面氧更容易参与反应。

2. 它反映了氧化物作为良好氧化剂的能力。OVFE较低的氧化物更容易释放氧以创造空位，这对机理的第一步至关重要。

3. 它间接影响机理的第二步，因为空位形成的容易程度影响了吸附和活化气相氧进行再氧化的能力。

总之，较低的OVFE通常表明催化剂在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中更活跃，因为它既促进了晶格氧的移除，又有利于催化剂表面的随后再氧化。
