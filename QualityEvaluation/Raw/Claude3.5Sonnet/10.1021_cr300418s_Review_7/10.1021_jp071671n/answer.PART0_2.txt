[1] "In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

[3] "The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. The reactant species interacts with oxygen atoms on the oxide surface, removing them and creating oxygen vacancies. This step requires the oxide to be a good oxidant, readily giving up its surface oxygen.

2. The reduced oxide surface then adsorbs oxygen molecules from the gas phase. These adsorbed oxygen molecules are activated, with one oxygen atom going to oxidize another reactant molecule and the other healing the oxygen vacancy on the surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower OVFE indicates that surface oxygen atoms are more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant and potentially more active catalyst. The OVFE serves as a measure of how readily the lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, with lower values suggesting easier participation and potentially higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两个步骤进行：

1. 反应物与氧化物表面的氧原子相互作用，移除这些氧原子并产生氧空位。这一步要求氧化物是一个良好的氧化剂，能够容易地释放表面氧。

2. 还原后的氧化物表面随后吸附气相中的氧分子。这些吸附的氧分子被活化，其中一个氧原子用于氧化另一个反应分子，另一个氧原子则修复表面的氧空位。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv或OVFE）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面非常重要。较低的OVFE表明表面氧原子更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂和可能更活跃的催化剂。OVFE作为晶格氧参与Mars-van Krevelen机理容易程度的衡量标准，较低的值表明更容易参与，可能导致氧化反应的更高催化活性。
