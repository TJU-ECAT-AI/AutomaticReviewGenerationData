          [1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

          [2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

          A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the oxidation process. The oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the reaction, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the oxide holds its oxygen more tightly, which may result in lower catalytic activity but potentially stronger oxidizing ability when oxygen is finally removed.

          The oxidizing ability of the surface is related to how strongly it can pull electrons from the species being oxidized, which is influenced by the strength of the metal-oxygen bonds in the oxide. An oxide with a higher ΔEv may have stronger metal-oxygen bonds, potentially leading to a stronger oxidizing ability.

          The significance of ΔEv lies in its use as a predictor of the oxide's ability to perform oxidation reactions, allowing researchers to estimate catalytic performance. Understanding and manipulating ΔEv, such as through doping (replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations), allows researchers to tune the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces for specific reactions and applications, optimizing both activity and selectivity.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

          较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许更容易形成氧空位，而氧空位对氧化过程至关重要。氧化物可以更容易地提供晶格氧用于反应，可能导致更高的催化活性。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧化物对其氧的结合更紧密，这可能导致较低的催化活性，但当氧最终被移除时，可能具有更强的氧化能力。

          表面的氧化能力与它从被氧化物种中拉取电子的能力有关，这受到氧化物中金属-氧键强度的影响。ΔEv较高的氧化物可能具有更强的金属-氧键，可能导致更强的氧化能力。

          ΔEv的重要性在于它可以用作预测氧化物进行氧化反应能力的指标，使研究人员能够估计催化性能。理解和操纵ΔEv，例如通过掺杂（将氧化物中的一些阳离子替换为其他阳离子），允许研究人员为特定反应和应用调整氧化物表面的催化性质，优化活性和选择性。
