[1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

[2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in this process as it determines how easily the lattice oxygen can be removed and participate in the reaction. 

ΔEv is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more readily release its lattice oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the oxide holds onto its oxygen more tightly, which may result in lower oxidizing ability.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is directly related to how easily it can give up oxygen to the reactants. Therefore, oxides with lower ΔEv values are often considered to be more active oxidation catalysts. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may be unstable under reaction conditions.

Importantly, ΔEv can be manipulated through doping, which involves replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations. This provides a way to tune the catalytic properties of oxide materials for specific oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在这个过程中至关重要，因为它决定了晶格氧能够多容易被移除并参与反应。

ΔEv在决定催化活性和氧化物表面的氧化能力方面都具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地释放其晶格氧，可能导致更高的氧化反应催化活性。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧化物更紧密地保持其氧，这可能导致较低的氧化能力。

表面的氧化能力直接与它能多容易地将氧给予反应物有关。因此，具有较低ΔEv值的氧化物通常被认为是更活跃的氧化催化剂。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能在反应条件下不稳定。

重要的是，ΔEv可以通过掺杂来操纵，这涉及将氧化物中的一些阳离子替换为其他阳离子。这提供了一种方法来调整氧化物材料的催化性能，以适应特定的氧化反应。
