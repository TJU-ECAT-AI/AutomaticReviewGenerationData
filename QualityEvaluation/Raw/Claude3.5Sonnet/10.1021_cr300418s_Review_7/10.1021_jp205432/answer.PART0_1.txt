[1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

[2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the oxidation process. The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv, as it reflects how readily the oxide can release oxygen for the reaction. The significance of ΔEv lies in its use as a predictor of the oxide's ability to perform oxidation reactions, allowing researchers to estimate catalytic performance. Additionally, ΔEv can be manipulated through doping, providing a method to tune the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces for specific applications.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面氧空位的形成和补充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许更容易形成氧空位，而氧空位对氧化过程至关重要。表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv相关，因为它反映了氧化物释放氧以进行反应的能力。ΔEv的重要性在于它可以用作预测氧化物进行氧化反应能力的指标，使研究人员能够估计催化性能。此外，ΔEv可以通过掺杂进行操控，为特定应用调整氧化物表面的催化性能提供了方法。
