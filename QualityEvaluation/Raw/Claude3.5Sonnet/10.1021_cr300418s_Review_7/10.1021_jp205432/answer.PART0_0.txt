[1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

[2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and refilling of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies, which are active sites for the oxidation reaction. The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv, as it reflects how easily the oxide can release oxygen to participate in the reaction. By manipulating ΔEv through methods such as doping, researchers can tune the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces for specific oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面氧空位的形成和再填充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它有利于氧空位的创建，而氧空位是氧化反应的活性位点。表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关，因为它反映了氧化物释放氧参与反应的难易程度。通过诸如掺杂等方法操纵ΔEv，研究人员可以调节氧化物表面的催化性质，以适应特定的氧化反应。
