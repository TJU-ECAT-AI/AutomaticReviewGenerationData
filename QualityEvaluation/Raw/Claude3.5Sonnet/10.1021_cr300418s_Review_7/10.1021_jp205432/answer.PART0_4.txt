[1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

[2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in this process as it determines how easily the lattice oxygen can be removed and participate in the reaction.

ΔEv is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the oxide holds its oxygen more tightly, which may result in lower catalytic activity but potentially stronger oxidizing ability.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is related to how strongly it can pull electrons from the species being oxidized, which is influenced by the strength of the metal-oxygen bonds in the oxide. An oxide with a higher ΔEv may have stronger metal-oxygen bonds, potentially leading to a stronger oxidizing ability when oxygen is finally removed.

By manipulating ΔEv through methods such as doping, researchers can tune the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces, optimizing them for specific oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到来自氧化物催化剂的晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在这个过程中至关重要，因为它决定了晶格氧能够多容易被移除并参与反应。

ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地提供晶格氧用于氧化反应，可能导致更高的催化活性。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧化物对其氧的结合更紧密，这可能导致较低的催化活性，但可能具有更强的氧化能力。

表面的氧化能力与它从被氧化物种中拉取电子的能力有关，这受到氧化物中金属-氧键强度的影响。ΔEv较高的氧化物可能具有更强的金属-氧键，当氧最终被移除时，可能导致更强的氧化能力。

通过诸如掺杂等方法操纵ΔEv，研究人员可以调节氧化物表面的催化性质，为特定的氧化反应进行优化。
