[1] "The catalytic properties of CeO2 for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions have implications for a variety of applications. Surface reduction and methane activation are key processes in the overall oxidation reaction, and are examined herein for pure CeO2 (111), (110) and (100) surfaces and surfaces with Zr or Pd substituted in Ce lattice positions."

[2] "Oxygen vacancy formation is more exothermic for Zr and Pd substituted ceria surfaces than for pure ceria, with Pd-substituted surfaces being significantly more reducible."

[3] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment."

[4] "We report the energies of oxygen vacancy formation for each surface, the preferred adsorption mode and sites for methane adsorption, and the dissociative methane adsorption energy."

[5] "Thus, dissociative methane adsorption is a surface reduction process, and is less exothermic on surfaces which are prereduced due to the formation of oxygen vacancies."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity. Surfaces that can more easily form oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) are typically more active for oxidation reactions. This is because the easier formation of vacancies facilitates the reaction between lattice oxygen and adsorbed species.

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv is also indicative of the oxide's oxidizing power. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more readily release its oxygen, making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become over-reduced and lose its catalytic activity.

3. Surface reducibility: The study shows that Zr and Pd substitution in ceria surfaces lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increasing the surface reducibility. This enhanced reducibility correlates with improved catalytic activity for methane oxidation.

4. Reaction energetics: The energy of dissociative methane adsorption, a key step in methane oxidation, correlates with the vacancy formation energy. Surfaces with lower ΔEv (more easily reducible) show more exothermic methane adsorption.

5. Activation barriers: The activation barrier for methane dissociation is also linked to surface reducibility. More reducible surfaces (lower ΔEv) tend to have lower activation barriers for methane activation.

In summary, ΔEv serves as a descriptor for the catalyst's ability to participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, influencing both its activity in oxidation reactions and its oxidizing power. Balancing the ease of vacancy formation with the ability to re-oxidize the surface is key to designing effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及催化剂晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，晶格氧与吸附物种反应，在催化剂表面创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧重新填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的催化活性。更容易形成氧空位（较低ΔEv）的表面通常对氧化反应更活跃。这是因为空位的更容易形成促进了晶格氧与吸附物种之间的反应。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv也表示氧化物的氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易释放其氧，使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其催化活性。

3. 表面还原性：研究表明，在氧化铈表面替代Zr和Pd降低了氧空位形成的能量，增加了表面还原性。这种增强的还原性与甲烷氧化的催化活性改善相关。

4. 反应能量学：甲烷解离吸附的能量，作为甲烷氧化的关键步骤，与空位形成能量相关。ΔEv较低（更易还原）的表面显示出更放热的甲烷吸附。

5. 活化能垒：甲烷解离的活化能垒也与表面还原性相关。更易还原的表面（较低ΔEv）倾向于具有较低的甲烷活化能垒。

总之，ΔEv作为催化剂参与Mars-van Krevelen机制能力的描述符，影响其在氧化反应中的活性和氧化能力。平衡空位形成的容易程度与再氧化表面的能力是设计有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应的关键。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide insights into the relationship between oxygen vacancy formation and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy correlates with increased surface reducibility, which in turn leads to more exothermic methane adsorption and lower activation barriers for dissociative methane adsorption.

The study shows that incorporating metals like Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption. This suggests that modifying the surface composition can enhance the catalytic activity for methane oxidation.

The literature also indicates that dissociative methane adsorption is less exothermic on pre-reduced (vacant) surfaces compared to intact surfaces, highlighting the importance of surface oxidation state in the catalytic process.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly addressed, these findings are consistent with its principles, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction and is subsequently replenished from the gas phase.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但它确实提供了关于氧空位形成与CeO2基材料甲烷氧化催化活性之间关系的见解。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义。较低的氧空位形成能与表面还原性增强相关，这反过来导致甲烷吸附更加放热，并降低了甲烷解离吸附的活化能垒。

研究表明，在表面的铈氧化物晶格中掺入Zr或Pd等金属可以降低氧空位形成的能量，以及甲烷吸附的反应能和能垒。这表明改变表面组成可以提高甲烷氧化的催化活性。

文献还指出，与完整表面相比，在预还原（有空位）表面上的解离性甲烷吸附放热性较低，这突出了表面氧化态在催化过程中的重要性。

虽然没有直接提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但这些发现与其原理是一致的，即晶格氧参与氧化反应，随后从气相中补充。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, followed by re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. This is because the vacancies created can more readily participate in the oxidation of adsorbed species. The study shows that substituting Zr or Pd into CeO2 lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the surface's reducibility and catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. A surface with a lower ΔEv can more easily give up oxygen to oxidize adsorbates, but it may also be less effective at re-oxidizing itself with gas-phase oxygen. This balance is crucial for sustained catalytic activity.

The study demonstrates a correlation between surface reducibility (related to ΔEv) and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials. This relationship highlights the significance of ΔEv in understanding and predicting catalytic behavior in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后由气相氧重新氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表示更容易形成氧空位，这与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。这是因为所创造的空位可以更容易地参与吸附物种的氧化。研究表明，将Zr或Pd替代进CeO2中可以降低氧空位形成的能量，从而增强表面的可还原性和催化活性。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地释放氧来氧化吸附物，但它可能也不太有效地用气相氧重新氧化自身。这种平衡对于持续的催化活性至关重要。

该研究证明了CeO2基材料上表面可还原性（与ΔEv相关）与甲烷氧化催化活性之间的相关性。这种关系突出了ΔEv在理解和预测氧化物催化氧化反应中催化行为方面的重要性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its correlation with the surface reducibility and reactivity. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more easily reducible, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity. This is because a more reducible surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction and subsequently replenish the oxygen vacancy.

The study shows a clear correlation between oxygen vacancy formation energy and methane adsorption energy across different surface compositions of ceria. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies (more reducible) exhibited more exothermic methane adsorption, suggesting higher reactivity. This relationship demonstrates that the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is closely tied to its reducibility, as determined by ΔEv.

Furthermore, the incorporation of certain metals (like Zr or Pd) into the ceria lattice was found to lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption. This illustrates how modifying the oxide composition can tune its reducibility and, consequently, its catalytic activity in oxidation reactions.

In summary, ΔEv serves as a key descriptor for understanding and predicting the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in Mars-van Krevelen type oxidation reactions, linking the fundamental property of surface reducibility to practical catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与表面还原性和反应性的相关性。较低的ΔEv表明表面更容易被还原，这通常会导致更高的催化活性。这是因为更容易还原的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，并随后补充氧空位。

研究表明，在不同的氧化铈表面组成中，氧空位形成能与甲烷吸附能之间存在明显的相关性。具有较低空位形成能（更易还原）的表面表现出更放热的甲烷吸附，这表明反应性更高。这种关系表明，氧化物表面的氧化能力与其还原性密切相关，而还原性由ΔEv决定。

此外，研究发现，将某些金属（如Zr或Pd）掺入氧化铈晶格可以降低氧空位形成的能量，以及甲烷吸附的反应能和能垒。这说明了如何通过修改氧化物组成来调节其还原性，从而影响其在氧化反应中的催化活性。

总之，ΔEv作为一个关键描述符，有助于理解和预测氧化物表面在Mars-van Krevelen型氧化反应中的催化行为，将表面还原性这一基本性质与实际催化性能联系起来。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity. This is because a lower energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen, which can then participate in the oxidation of reactants. The study shows that incorporating metals like Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, thus potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv is directly related to the oxide's oxidizing power. A lower ΔEv means that the oxide can more readily give up its oxygen, making it a stronger oxidizing agent. Conversely, a higher ΔEv indicates that the oxide holds onto its oxygen more tightly, resulting in weaker oxidizing ability.

The study demonstrates a correlation between surface reducibility (measured by oxygen vacancy formation energy) and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials. The authors found that both oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are surface reduction processes, and the reaction energy for methane oxidation correlates with surface reducibility.

Furthermore, the activation barrier for methane dissociation also correlates with the surface reducibility. This suggests that modifying the oxide surface to lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy can enhance both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the oxidation reaction.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism highlights the importance of ΔEv in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. By understanding and manipulating this parameter, researchers can design more effective catalysts for various oxidation processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及晶格氧从氧化物催化剂中参与反应。在这个机理中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在催化剂表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧补充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性。这是因为氧空位形成的能量障碍较低，使得晶格氧更容易被移除，从而参与反应物的氧化。研究表明，将锆或钯等金属掺入氧化铈晶格可以降低氧空位形成的能量，从而可能提高催化活性。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv与氧化物的氧化能力直接相关。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物更容易释放其氧，使其成为更强的氧化剂。相反，较高的ΔEv表示氧化物更紧密地保持其氧，导致较弱的氧化能力。

该研究证明了基于CeO2材料的甲烷氧化催化活性与表面还原性（通过氧空位形成能测量）之间的相关性。作者发现，氧空位形成和甲烷吸附都是表面还原过程，甲烷氧化的反应能与表面还原性相关。

此外，甲烷解离的活化能也与表面还原性相关。这表明，通过修改氧化物表面以降低氧空位形成能，可以同时提高氧化反应的热力学和动力学性能。

总之，Mars-van Krevelen机理突出了ΔEv在氧化物催化氧化反应中的重要性。通过理解和操纵这个参数，研究人员可以为各种氧化过程设计更有效的催化剂。
