The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, followed by re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. This is because the vacancies created can more readily participate in the oxidation of adsorbed species. The study shows that substituting Zr or Pd into CeO2 lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the surface's reducibility and catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. A surface with a lower ΔEv can more easily give up oxygen to oxidize adsorbates, but it may also be less effective at re-oxidizing itself with gas-phase oxygen. This balance is crucial for sustained catalytic activity.

The study demonstrates a correlation between surface reducibility (related to ΔEv) and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials. This relationship highlights the significance of ΔEv in understanding and predicting catalytic behavior in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后由气相氧重新氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表示更容易形成氧空位，这与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。这是因为所创造的空位可以更容易地参与吸附物种的氧化。研究表明，将Zr或Pd替代进CeO2中可以降低氧空位形成的能量，从而增强表面的可还原性和催化活性。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地释放氧来氧化吸附物，但它可能也不太有效地用气相氧重新氧化自身。这种平衡对于持续的催化活性至关重要。

该研究证明了CeO2基材料上表面可还原性（与ΔEv相关）与甲烷氧化催化活性之间的相关性。这种关系突出了ΔEv在理解和预测氧化物催化氧化反应中催化行为方面的重要性。
