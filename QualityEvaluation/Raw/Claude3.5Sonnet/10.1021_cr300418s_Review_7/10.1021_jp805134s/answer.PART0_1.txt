[1] "Oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are both reduction processes on ceria, specifically causing the reduction of surface metal atoms."

[2] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation were determined using the DFT+U method. We do not address the preference for Pd or Zr to occupy Ce surface sites, a topic which will be addressed in subsequent studies."

[3] "The dissociative adsorption of methane was also considered on vacant, Zr or Pd substituted surfaces. In each case, adsorption was less exothermic than for intact surfaces due to the prereduced nature of surface metal atoms."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide insights into the relationship between oxygen vacancy formation and catalytic activity for methane oxidation on CeO2-based materials.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy correlates with increased surface reducibility, which in turn leads to more exothermic methane adsorption and lower activation barriers for dissociative methane adsorption.

The study shows that incorporating metals like Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption. This suggests that modifying the surface composition can enhance the catalytic activity for methane oxidation.

The literature also indicates that dissociative methane adsorption is less exothermic on pre-reduced (vacant) surfaces compared to intact surfaces, highlighting the importance of surface oxidation state in the catalytic process.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly addressed, these findings are consistent with its principles, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction and is subsequently replenished from the gas phase.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但它确实提供了关于氧空位形成与CeO2基材料甲烷氧化催化活性之间关系的见解。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义。较低的氧空位形成能与表面还原性增强相关，这反过来导致甲烷吸附更加放热，并降低了甲烷解离吸附的活化能垒。

研究表明，在表面的铈氧化物晶格中掺入Zr或Pd等金属可以降低氧空位形成的能量，以及甲烷吸附的反应能和能垒。这表明改变表面组成可以提高甲烷氧化的催化活性。

文献还指出，与完整表面相比，在预还原（有空位）表面上的解离性甲烷吸附放热性较低，这突出了表面氧化态在催化过程中的重要性。

虽然没有直接提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但这些发现与其原理是一致的，即晶格氧参与氧化反应，随后从气相中补充。
