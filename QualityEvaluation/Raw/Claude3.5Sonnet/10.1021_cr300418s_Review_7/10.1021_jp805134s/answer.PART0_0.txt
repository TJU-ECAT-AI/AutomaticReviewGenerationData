[1] "The catalytic properties of CeO2 for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions have implications for a variety of applications. Surface reduction and methane activation are key processes in the overall oxidation reaction, and are examined herein for pure CeO2 (111), (110) and (100) surfaces and surfaces with Zr or Pd substituted in Ce lattice positions."

[2] "Oxygen vacancy formation is more exothermic for Zr and Pd substituted ceria surfaces than for pure ceria, with Pd-substituted surfaces being significantly more reducible."

[3] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment."

[4] "We report the energies of oxygen vacancy formation for each surface, the preferred adsorption mode and sites for methane adsorption, and the dissociative methane adsorption energy."

[5] "Thus, dissociative methane adsorption is a surface reduction process, and is less exothermic on surfaces which are prereduced due to the formation of oxygen vacancies."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity. Surfaces that can more easily form oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) are typically more active for oxidation reactions. This is because the easier formation of vacancies facilitates the reaction between lattice oxygen and adsorbed species.

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv is also indicative of the oxide's oxidizing power. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more readily release its oxygen, making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become over-reduced and lose its catalytic activity.

3. Surface reducibility: The study shows that Zr and Pd substitution in ceria surfaces lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increasing the surface reducibility. This enhanced reducibility correlates with improved catalytic activity for methane oxidation.

4. Reaction energetics: The energy of dissociative methane adsorption, a key step in methane oxidation, correlates with the vacancy formation energy. Surfaces with lower ΔEv (more easily reducible) show more exothermic methane adsorption.

5. Activation barriers: The activation barrier for methane dissociation is also linked to surface reducibility. More reducible surfaces (lower ΔEv) tend to have lower activation barriers for methane activation.

In summary, ΔEv serves as a descriptor for the catalyst's ability to participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, influencing both its activity in oxidation reactions and its oxidizing power. Balancing the ease of vacancy formation with the ability to re-oxidize the surface is key to designing effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及催化剂晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，晶格氧与吸附物种反应，在催化剂表面创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧重新填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的催化活性。更容易形成氧空位（较低ΔEv）的表面通常对氧化反应更活跃。这是因为空位的更容易形成促进了晶格氧与吸附物种之间的反应。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv也表示氧化物的氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易释放其氧，使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其催化活性。

3. 表面还原性：研究表明，在氧化铈表面替代Zr和Pd降低了氧空位形成的能量，增加了表面还原性。这种增强的还原性与甲烷氧化的催化活性改善相关。

4. 反应能量学：甲烷解离吸附的能量，作为甲烷氧化的关键步骤，与空位形成能量相关。ΔEv较低（更易还原）的表面显示出更放热的甲烷吸附。

5. 活化能垒：甲烷解离的活化能垒也与表面还原性相关。更易还原的表面（较低ΔEv）倾向于具有较低的甲烷活化能垒。

总之，ΔEv作为催化剂参与Mars-van Krevelen机制能力的描述符，影响其在氧化反应中的活性和氧化能力。平衡空位形成的容易程度与再氧化表面的能力是设计有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应的关键。
