[1] "Oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are both reduction processes on ceria, specifically causing the reduction of surface metal atoms."

[2] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption over pure and Zr or Pd substituted ceria (111), (110) and (100) surfaces were determined using the DFT+U method."

[3] "Figure 7 shows the dissociative adsorption energy of methane plotted versus vacancy formation energy for each surface investigated."

[4] "The general trend between the energetics of vacancy formation and methane adsorption, however, suggests that the energy of methane adsorption on ceria surfaces is dependent on surface reducibility."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its correlation with the surface reducibility and reactivity. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more easily reducible, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity. This is because a more reducible surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction and subsequently replenish the oxygen vacancy.

The study shows a clear correlation between oxygen vacancy formation energy and methane adsorption energy across different surface compositions of ceria. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies (more reducible) exhibited more exothermic methane adsorption, suggesting higher reactivity. This relationship demonstrates that the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is closely tied to its reducibility, as determined by ΔEv.

Furthermore, the incorporation of certain metals (like Zr or Pd) into the ceria lattice was found to lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption. This illustrates how modifying the oxide composition can tune its reducibility and, consequently, its catalytic activity in oxidation reactions.

In summary, ΔEv serves as a key descriptor for understanding and predicting the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in Mars-van Krevelen type oxidation reactions, linking the fundamental property of surface reducibility to practical catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与表面还原性和反应性的相关性。较低的ΔEv表明表面更容易被还原，这通常会导致更高的催化活性。这是因为更容易还原的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，并随后补充氧空位。

研究表明，在不同的氧化铈表面组成中，氧空位形成能与甲烷吸附能之间存在明显的相关性。具有较低空位形成能（更易还原）的表面表现出更放热的甲烷吸附，这表明反应性更高。这种关系表明，氧化物表面的氧化能力与其还原性密切相关，而还原性由ΔEv决定。

此外，研究发现，将某些金属（如Zr或Pd）掺入氧化铈晶格可以降低氧空位形成的能量，以及甲烷吸附的反应能和能垒。这说明了如何通过修改氧化物组成来调节其还原性，从而影响其在氧化反应中的催化活性。

总之，ΔEv作为一个关键描述符，有助于理解和预测氧化物表面在Mars-van Krevelen型氧化反应中的催化行为，将表面还原性这一基本性质与实际催化性能联系起来。
