<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or its role in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The paper focuses on oxygen vacancy formation in Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions, but does not relate this to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or catalytic oxidation reactions. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

However, the paper does discuss the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVf) in determining the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of Ce1-xZrxO2 materials. While not directly addressing catalytic activity or oxidizing ability, this information is related to the material's ability to release and store oxygen, which is relevant to its potential use in catalytic systems.

给定的文献并没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或其在氧化物催化氧化反应中的作用。该论文主要关注Ce1-xZrxO2固溶体中的氧空位形成，但并未将其与Mars-van Krevelen机制或催化氧化反应联系起来。因此，基于所提供的文本无法回答这个具体问题。

然而，该论文确实讨论了氧空位形成能(EVf)在决定Ce1-xZrxO2材料的氧储存容量(OSC)方面的重要性。虽然没有直接涉及催化活性或氧化能力，但这些信息与材料释放和储存氧的能力有关，这与其在催化系统中的潜在应用相关。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on oxygen vacancy formation in Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions, but does not specifically address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or catalytic oxidation reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

However, the paper does discuss the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy in determining the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of Ce1-xZrxO2 materials, which is related to their ability to release and store oxygen. This property is crucial for applications in catalysis, particularly in automotive exhaust control. The study shows that the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is lowest for Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, which explains why this composition exhibits the best OSC performance.

While not directly addressing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, this information suggests that the ease of oxygen vacancy formation (related to lower ΔEv) is indeed important for the material's ability to participate in oxidation-reduction cycles, which is a key aspect of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

本文献没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理和氧空位形成能(ΔEv)的重要性。文章主要集中在Ce1-xZrxO2固溶体中的氧空位形成，但并未具体涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理或催化氧化反应。因此，仅根据本文提供的信息无法完全回答这个问题。

然而，文章确实讨论了氧空位形成能在决定Ce1-xZrxO2材料的氧储存能力(OSC)方面的重要性，这与它们释放和储存氧的能力有关。这一性质对于催化应用至关重要，尤其是在汽车尾气控制方面。研究表明，Ce0.5Zr0.5O2的氧空位形成能最低，这解释了为什么这种组成表现出最佳的OSC性能。

虽然没有直接提到Mars-van Krevelen机理，但这些信息表明，氧空位形成的容易程度（与较低的ΔEv相关）确实对材料参与氧化还原循环的能力很重要，而这是氧化物催化氧化反应的一个关键方面。
