[1] "It is widely accepted that the reactivity of TiO2(110), as that of many other oxide surfaces, is dominated by defect sites, particularly surface oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf), Evf=Etot(def)+1/2Etot(O2)-Etot(perf), where Etot(def), Etot(perf) are total energies for the defective and stoichiometric surfaces, respectively, and Etot(O2) is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "We find that no O2 adsorption takes place on the stoichiometric surface, whereas on the defective surface two preferential molecular and one dissociated adsorbed configurations are identified."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in this literature. However, the paper does provide insights into oxygen vacancy formation and reactivity on oxide surfaces, which are key aspects of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The literature emphasizes that surface oxygen vacancies dominate the reactivity of TiO2(110) and other oxide surfaces. These vacancies play a crucial role in catalytic reactions, as they provide active sites for adsorption and reaction.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is calculated as the difference between the energies of the defective surface, half an O2 molecule, and the perfect surface. This value is significant because it determines how easily oxygen can be removed from the surface, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The paper demonstrates that O2 adsorption only occurs on the defective surface with oxygen vacancies, not on the stoichiometric surface. This indicates that the presence of vacancies is essential for the catalytic activity of the oxide surface.

While the paper doesn't directly address the oxidizing ability of the surface, it can be inferred that a lower ΔEv would lead to easier vacancy formation and potentially higher oxidizing ability. Conversely, a higher ΔEv would make vacancy formation more difficult, potentially reducing the oxide's oxidizing ability.

In summary, although the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed, the paper's focus on oxygen vacancies, their formation energy, and their role in O2 adsorption provides valuable insights into the factors that influence catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

虽然这篇文献没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但它确实提供了有关氧空位形成和氧化物表面反应性的见解，这些是Mars-van Krevelen机制的关键方面。

文献强调，表面氧空位主导了TiO2(110)和其他氧化物表面的反应性。这些空位在催化反应中起着关键作用，因为它们为吸附和反应提供了活性位点。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）被计算为缺陷表面能量、半个O2分子能量和完整表面能量之间的差值。这个值很重要，因为它决定了从表面移除氧的难易程度，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的关键步骤。

该论文表明，O2吸附只发生在有氧空位的缺陷表面上，而不发生在化学计量比表面上。这表明空位的存在对氧化物表面的催化活性至关重要。

虽然论文没有直接讨论表面的氧化能力，但可以推断，较低的ΔEv会导致更容易形成空位，可能会提高氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv会使空位形成更加困难，可能会降低氧化物的氧化能力。

总之，尽管没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但该论文对氧空位、其形成能以及它们在O2吸附中的作用的关注，为影响氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的因素提供了有价值的见解。
