[1] "It is widely accepted that the reactivity of TiO2(110), as that of many other oxide surfaces, is dominated by defect sites, particularly surface oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf), Evf=Etot(def)+1/2Etot(O2)-Etot(perf), where Etot(def), Etot(perf) are total energies for the defective and stoichiometric surfaces, respectively, and Etot(O2) is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "We find that no O2 adsorption takes place on the stoichiometric surface, whereas on the defective surface two preferential molecular and one dissociated adsorbed configurations are identified."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the document provides some relevant information about oxygen vacancies and their role in surface reactivity of metal oxides like TiO2.

The literature indicates that surface oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining the reactivity of oxide surfaces like TiO2(110). These vacancies act as defect sites that dominate the surface reactivity. 

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is calculated as the difference between the total energies of the defective and stoichiometric surfaces, plus half the energy of an O2 molecule. This energy is important because it relates to how easily oxygen vacancies can form on the surface.

The significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability is implied by the observation that O2 adsorption only occurs on the defective (reduced) surface with oxygen vacancies, not on the stoichiometric surface. This suggests that the presence of oxygen vacancies, which is related to ΔEv, is critical for the surface to interact with and activate oxygen molecules - a key step in oxidation reactions.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly described, these findings about oxygen vacancies and O2 adsorption align with the general principles of that mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction and is then replenished from the gas phase.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在给定的文献中并没有被明确讨论。然而，该文献提供了一些关于氧空位及其在金属氧化物（如TiO2）表面反应性中的作用的相关信息。

文献指出，表面氧空位在决定像TiO2(110)这样的氧化物表面的反应性方面起着至关重要的作用。这些空位作为缺陷位点主导了表面反应性。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）被计算为有缺陷表面和化学计量表面总能量之差，加上O2分子能量的一半。这个能量很重要，因为它与表面上氧空位形成的容易程度有关。

ΔEv在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性可以从以下观察中推断出来：O2吸附只发生在有氧空位的有缺陷（还原）表面上，而不是在化学计量表面上。这表明氧空位的存在（与ΔEv相关）对于表面与氧分子相互作用和活化氧分子至关重要——这是氧化反应的关键步骤。

虽然Mars-van Krevelen机理没有被明确描述，但这些关于氧空位和O2吸附的发现与该机理的一般原理相符，即晶格氧参与反应，然后从气相中补充。
