[1] "It is widely accepted that the reactivity of TiO2(110), as that of many other oxide surfaces, is dominated by defect sites, particularly surface oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf), Evf=Etot(def)+1/2Etot(O2)-Etot(perf), where Etot(def), Etot(perf) are total energies for the defective and stoichiometric surfaces, respectively, and Etot(O2) is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "We find that no O2 adsorption takes place on the stoichiometric surface, whereas on the defective surface two preferential molecular and one dissociated adsorbed configurations are identified."

The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or its significance in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The text focuses on oxygen vacancy formation and O2 adsorption on TiO2(110) surfaces, but does not explicitly relate this to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or catalytic activity.

However, the literature does provide some relevant information about oxygen vacancies and their role in surface reactivity:

1. Surface oxygen vacancies are important defect sites that dominate the reactivity of TiO2(110) and other oxide surfaces.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (Evf) is calculated and reported for the TiO2(110) surface.

3. O2 adsorption occurs on the defective (partially reduced) surface with oxygen vacancies, but not on the stoichiometric surface.

While these points are related to the reactivity of oxide surfaces, the text does not directly address how they determine catalytic activity or oxidizing ability in the context of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

提供的文献并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或其在氧化物催化氧化反应中的重要性。文本主要关注TiO2(110)表面的氧空位形成和O2吸附，但没有明确将其与Mars-van Krevelen机制或催化活性联系起来。

然而，文献确实提供了一些关于氧空位及其在表面反应性中作用的相关信息：

1. 表面氧空位是重要的缺陷位点，主导了TiO2(110)和其他氧化物表面的反应性。

2. 计算并报告了TiO2(110)表面所需的氧空位形成能(Evf)。

3. O2吸附发生在具有氧空位的缺陷（部分还原）表面上，而不是在化学计量比表面上。

虽然这些点与氧化物表面的反应性有关，但文本并未直接说明它们如何在Mars-van Krevelen机制的背景下决定催化活性或氧化能力。
