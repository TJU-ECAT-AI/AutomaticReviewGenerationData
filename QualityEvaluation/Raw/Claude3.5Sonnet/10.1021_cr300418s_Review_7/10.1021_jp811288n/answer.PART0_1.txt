The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides some relevant information about oxygen vacancies and their role in catalysis on oxide surfaces, particularly for TiO2. 

Surface oxygen vacancies are important active sites for adsorption and dissociation of molecules in catalytic reactions. These vacancies can be formed through processes like ion bombardment or thermal annealing. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies is believed to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2 by creating reactive sites for molecule adsorption.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) varies depending on the surface orientation of TiO2. The literature reports that vacancy formation energies follow the trend ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101). This suggests that oxygen vacancies form more easily on some surfaces than others, which could influence the catalytic activity of different TiO2 crystal facets.

While not directly addressing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or oxidizing ability, these findings imply that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies may be more catalytically active due to the greater ease of creating reactive sites. The variation in vacancy formation energies across different surfaces also suggests that the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface may differ depending on its crystallographic orientation.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了一些关于氧空位及其在氧化物表面催化中作用的相关信息，特别是对于TiO2。

表面氧空位是催化反应中分子吸附和解离的重要活性位点。这些空位可以通过离子轰击或热退火等过程形成。形成氧空位的容易程度被认为有助于TiO2的催化行为，因为它创造了分子吸附的反应位点。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）因TiO2的表面取向而异。文献报道空位形成能遵循ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)的趋势。这表明在某些表面上比其他表面更容易形成氧空位，这可能会影响不同TiO2晶面的催化活性。

虽然没有直接涉及Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧化能力，但这些发现暗示空位形成能较低的表面可能具有更高的催化活性，因为更容易创造反应位点。不同表面之间空位形成能的变化也表明，氧化物表面的氧化能力可能因其晶体学取向而异。
