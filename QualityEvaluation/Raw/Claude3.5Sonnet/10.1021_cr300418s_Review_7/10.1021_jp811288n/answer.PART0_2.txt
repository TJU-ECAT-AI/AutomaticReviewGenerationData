[1] "Formation of surface oxygen vacancies is easily achieved through ion bombardment or controlled thermal annealing and quenching. (17, 27-30) The ease with which oxygen vacancies can be formed is thought to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2, since this creates reactive sites into which molecules can adsorb."

[2] "Vacancy formation energies have been calculated according to
(1)
where KrgerVink notation has been used. Here the lattice site occupied is indicated by the subscript, and the superscript shows the electric charge of the species relative to that of the site it occupies in the stoichiometric crystal:"

[3] "Surface energies increase as Esurf(110) < Esurf(100) < Esurf(101) < Esurf(001), while vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101), demonstrating only weak correlation between surface stability and oxygen lability."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given text. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some relevant points about oxygen vacancy formation and its significance in catalytic activity:

1. Oxygen vacancies on oxide surfaces create reactive sites for molecule adsorption, which is important for catalytic activity.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) varies depending on the surface orientation of the oxide (in this case, TiO2).

3. There is only a weak correlation between surface stability and oxygen lability (ease of oxygen removal), suggesting that the most stable surfaces are not necessarily the most catalytically active.

4. The variation in vacancy formation energies across different surface orientations implies that different surfaces may have varying catalytic activities and oxidizing abilities.

5. The ease of oxygen vacancy formation contributes to the catalytic behavior of the oxide surface.

While the text does not directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or provide a comprehensive explanation of how ΔEv determines catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, it does suggest that the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation is an important factor in understanding the surface reactivity of oxide catalysts.

虽然给定的文本中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于氧空位形成及其对催化活性重要性的相关要点：

1. 氧化物表面上的氧空位为分子吸附创造了反应位点，这对催化活性很重要。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）因氧化物的表面取向而异（在本例中为TiO2）。

3. 表面稳定性和氧的活动性（氧易被移除的程度）之间只有微弱的相关性，这表明最稳定的表面不一定是催化活性最高的表面。

4. 不同表面取向的空位形成能量的变化意味着不同表面可能具有不同的催化活性和氧化能力。

5. 氧空位形成的容易程度有助于氧化物表面的催化行为。

虽然文本没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，也没有全面解释ΔEv如何决定催化活性和氧化能力，但它确实表明氧空位形成所需的能量是理解氧化物催化剂表面反应性的一个重要因素。
