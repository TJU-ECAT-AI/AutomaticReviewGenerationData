[1] "TiO2 has potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, (3-5) gas sensor devices, (6) and photocatalysis, (7-10) where surface defects are active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of molecules."

(17, 27-30) The ease with which oxygen vacancies can be formed is thought to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2, since this creates reactive sites into which molecules can adsorb."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides relevant information about oxygen vacancies in TiO2 that relates to this mechanism. 

In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The formation of oxygen vacancies is crucial for this process. The literature mentions that surface defects, including oxygen vacancies, are active sites for adsorption and dissociation of molecules in catalytic applications of TiO2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower vacancy formation energies generally indicate easier creation of active sites, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. The text provides vacancy formation energies for different TiO2 surfaces, showing that they vary depending on the surface orientation.

The ease of forming oxygen vacancies is noted to contribute to TiO2's catalytic behavior by creating reactive sites for molecule adsorption. This suggests that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies might exhibit higher catalytic activity in Mars-van Krevelen type reactions.

However, the oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by the strength of the metal-oxygen bond. While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that higher vacancy formation energies might correspond to stronger metal-oxygen bonds, potentially leading to higher oxidizing ability but lower vacancy concentration.

The variation in vacancy formation energies across different TiO2 surfaces implies that catalytic activity and oxidizing ability may differ depending on which crystal faces are exposed, potentially allowing for tuning of catalytic properties by controlling surface expression.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了与此机制相关的TiO2氧空位信息。

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位的形成对这个过程至关重要。文献提到，表面缺陷（包括氧空位）是TiO2催化应用中分子吸附和解离的活性位点。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的空位形成能通常表示更容易创建活性位点，可能导致更高的催化活性。文本提供了不同TiO2表面的空位形成能，显示它们因表面取向而异。

文献指出，容易形成氧空位有助于TiO2的催化行为，因为它创造了分子吸附的反应位点。这表明空位形成能较低的表面可能在Mars-van Krevelen型反应中表现出更高的催化活性。

然而，表面的氧化能力也受金属-氧键强度的影响。虽然没有明确说明，但可以推断，较高的空位形成能可能对应于更强的金属-氧键，潜在地导致更高的氧化能力，但空位浓度较低。

不同TiO2表面的空位形成能变化意味着催化活性和氧化能力可能因暴露的晶面而异，这可能允许通过控制表面表达来调节催化性质。
