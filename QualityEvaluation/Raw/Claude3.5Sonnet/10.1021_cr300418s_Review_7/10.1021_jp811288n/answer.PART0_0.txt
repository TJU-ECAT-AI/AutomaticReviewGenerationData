[1] "Formation of surface oxygen vacancies is easily achieved through ion bombardment or controlled thermal annealing and quenching. The ease with which oxygen vacancies can be formed is thought to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2, since this creates reactive sites into which molecules can adsorb."

[2] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."

[3] "Since O-deficient surfaces possess an electron excess, these defect states constitute frontier orbitals, and are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity as these vacancies create reactive sites for molecule adsorption. The ease of vacancy formation contributes to the material's ability to participate in redox reactions with adsorbed molecules.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies may be more reactive but potentially less stable, while those with higher ΔEv values might be more stable but less reactive. The study shows that vacancy formation energies vary across different TiO2 surfaces, suggesting that different crystal faces may exhibit varying catalytic behaviors.

The presence of oxygen vacancies creates electron-rich defect states that can participate in redox reactions, further affecting the surface's oxidizing ability. These variations in electronic structure and reactivity across different surfaces highlight the importance of understanding and controlling surface structure in catalyst design and optimization.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面上氧空位的形成和补充。氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易形成，这可能导致更高的催化活性，因为这些空位为分子吸附创造了反应位点。空位形成的容易程度有助于材料参与与吸附分子的氧化还原反应的能力。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。空位形成能较低的表面可能更具反应性但可能不太稳定，而ΔEv值较高的表面可能更稳定但反应性较低。研究表明，不同TiO2表面的空位形成能各不相同，这表明不同的晶面可能表现出不同的催化行为。

氧空位的存在会产生富电子的缺陷态，这些缺陷态可以参与氧化还原反应，进一步影响表面的氧化能力。不同表面之间电子结构和反应性的这些变化突出了在催化剂设计和优化中理解和控制表面结构的重要性。
