[1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

[2] "Obviously, it may help to recall the morphology of these ceria materials. Figure 6(a) shows a HRTEM image of the CeO2 nanoparticles. The dominant lattice fringes are from {111}, which are observed when the particles are oriented along the [110] direction."

[3] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. The reactant (e.g. CO) reduces the metal oxide surface by removing an oxygen atom, creating an oxygen vacancy.

2. Gaseous oxygen then fills this vacancy, dissociating into reactive atomic oxygen on the surface.

3. This reactive oxygen then participates in oxidizing another reactant molecule.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. Lower ΔEv makes it easier to create vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's ability to participate in the redox cycle.

2. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values. More stable planes like {111} have higher ΔEv and are less reactive, while less stable planes like {001} and {110} have lower ΔEv and are more reactive.

3. Catalysts exposing planes with lower ΔEv (e.g. CeO2 nanorods with {001} and {110} planes) tend to be more active than those exposing higher ΔEv planes (e.g. CeO2 nanoparticles with predominantly {111} planes).

4. Lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen exchange between the catalyst and gas phase, enhancing the oxidizing ability of the surface.

Thus, ΔEv serves as a key indicator of a catalyst's potential activity and oxidizing power in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制包括以下步骤：

1. 反应物（如CO）通过移除一个氧原子来还原金属氧化物表面，从而创造一个氧空位。

2. 气态氧然后填充这个空位，在表面上解离成反应性原子氧。

3. 这种反应性氧然后参与氧化另一个反应物分子。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要，原因如下：

1. 较低的ΔEv使得创造空位更容易，增强了催化剂参与氧化还原循环的能力。

2. 不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值。更稳定的晶面如{111}具有较高的ΔEv，反应性较低，而较不稳定的晶面如{001}和{110}具有较低的ΔEv，反应性较高。

3. 暴露低ΔEv晶面的催化剂（如具有{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒）往往比暴露高ΔEv晶面的催化剂（如主要暴露{111}晶面的CeO2纳米颗粒）更活跃。

4. 较低的ΔEv促进了催化剂与气相之间更容易的氧交换，增强了表面的氧化能力。

因此，在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，ΔEv作为催化剂潜在活性和氧化能力的关键指标。
