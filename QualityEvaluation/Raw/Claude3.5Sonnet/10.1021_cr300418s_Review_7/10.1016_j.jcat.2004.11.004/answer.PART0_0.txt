[1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

[2] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the reoxidation of the surface by O2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values correspond to more easily formed vacancies, leading to higher reactivity. The stability of crystal planes affects ΔEv, with less stable planes like {001} and {110} having lower ΔEv than more stable planes like {111}. This explains why CeO2 nanorods exposing {001} and {110} planes show higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to nanoparticles predominantly exposing {111} planes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及反应物（如CO）对氧化物表面的还原，形成氧空位，随后O2再次氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值对应于更容易形成的空位，导致更高的反应性。晶面的稳定性影响ΔEv，较不稳定的晶面如{001}和{110}比更稳定的晶面如{111}具有更低的ΔEv。这解释了为什么暴露{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒在CO氧化反应中表现出比主要暴露{111}晶面的纳米颗粒更高的催化活性。
