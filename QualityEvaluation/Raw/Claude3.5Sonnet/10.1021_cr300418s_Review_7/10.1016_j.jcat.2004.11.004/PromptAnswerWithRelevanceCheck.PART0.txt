[1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

[2] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the reoxidation of the surface by O2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values correspond to more easily formed vacancies, leading to higher reactivity. The stability of crystal planes affects ΔEv, with less stable planes like {001} and {110} having lower ΔEv than more stable planes like {111}. This explains why CeO2 nanorods exposing {001} and {110} planes show higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to nanoparticles predominantly exposing {111} planes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及反应物（如CO）对氧化物表面的还原，形成氧空位，随后O2再次氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值对应于更容易形成的空位，导致更高的反应性。晶面的稳定性影响ΔEv，较不稳定的晶面如{001}和{110}比更稳定的晶面如{111}具有更低的ΔEv。这解释了为什么暴露{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒在CO氧化反应中表现出比主要暴露{111}晶面的纳米颗粒更高的催化活性。

[1] "In general, high-surface-area nanocatalytic materials exhibiting numerous crystal faces, edges, and corners, which are conventionally considered active sites for the adsorption of reactants [4,5,28], should generate better catalytic performance."

[2] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen [30,31]."

[3] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive [1921]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the reoxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

Lower ΔEv values generally correspond to higher catalytic activity, as it is easier to create oxygen vacancies and maintain the redox cycle. Surfaces with lower stability, such as the {001} and {110} planes in CeO2, typically have lower ΔEv and are more reactive. Conversely, more stable surfaces like the {111} plane in CeO2 have higher ΔEv and are less reactive.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. Surfaces with lower ΔEv can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction, but if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become over-reduced and lose its catalytic activity. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv is necessary to balance reactivity and stability for effective catalysis.

In the context of the study, CeO2 nanorods exposing the more reactive {001} and {110} planes showed higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to nanoparticles predominantly exposing the stable {111} planes, demonstrating the significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及反应物（如CO）还原氧化物表面，创造氧空位，然后气相氧重新氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv值通常对应于更高的催化活性，因为更容易创造氧空位并维持氧化还原循环。稳定性较低的表面，如CeO2中的{001}和{110}平面，通常具有较低的ΔEv并且更具反应性。相反，更稳定的表面如CeO2中的{111}平面具有较高的ΔEv，反应性较低。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv影响。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，但如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其催化活性。因此，需要最佳的ΔEv来平衡反应性和稳定性，以实现有效的催化。

在这项研究中，暴露出更具反应性的{001}和{110}平面的CeO2纳米棒与主要暴露稳定{111}平面的纳米颗粒相比，显示出更高的CO氧化催化活性，这证明了ΔEv在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

[2] "Obviously, it may help to recall the morphology of these ceria materials. Figure 6(a) shows a HRTEM image of the CeO2 nanoparticles. The dominant lattice fringes are from {111}, which are observed when the particles are oriented along the [110] direction."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. The reactant (e.g. CO) reduces the metal oxide surface by removing an oxygen atom, creating an oxygen vacancy.

2. Gaseous oxygen then fills this vacancy, dissociating into reactive atomic oxygen on the surface.

3. This reactive oxygen then participates in oxidizing another reactant molecule.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. Lower ΔEv makes it easier to create vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's ability to participate in the redox cycle.

2. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values. More stable planes like {111} have higher ΔEv and are less reactive, while less stable planes like {001} and {110} have lower ΔEv and are more reactive.

3. Catalysts exposing planes with lower ΔEv (e.g. CeO2 nanorods with {001} and {110} planes) tend to be more active than those exposing higher ΔEv planes (e.g. CeO2 nanoparticles with predominantly {111} planes).

4. Lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen exchange between the catalyst and gas phase, enhancing the oxidizing ability of the surface.

Thus, ΔEv serves as a key indicator of a catalyst's potential activity and oxidizing power in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制包括以下步骤：

1. 反应物（如CO）通过移除一个氧原子来还原金属氧化物表面，从而创造一个氧空位。

2. 气态氧然后填充这个空位，在表面上解离成反应性原子氧。

3. 这种反应性氧然后参与氧化另一个反应物分子。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要，原因如下：

1. 较低的ΔEv使得创造空位更容易，增强了催化剂参与氧化还原循环的能力。

2. 不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值。更稳定的晶面如{111}具有较高的ΔEv，反应性较低，而较不稳定的晶面如{001}和{110}具有较低的ΔEv，反应性较高。

3. 暴露低ΔEv晶面的催化剂（如具有{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒）往往比暴露高ΔEv晶面的催化剂（如主要暴露{111}晶面的CeO2纳米颗粒）更活跃。

4. 较低的ΔEv促进了催化剂与气相之间更容易的氧交换，增强了表面的氧化能力。

因此，在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，ΔEv作为催化剂潜在活性和氧化能力的关键指标。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves a cycle where the oxide surface is reduced by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values correspond to more reactive surfaces that can more easily form oxygen vacancies, facilitating the redox cycle. This is demonstrated by the higher reactivity of CeO2 nanorods exposing {001} and {110} planes compared to nanoparticles with predominantly {111} planes. The more stable {111} planes have higher ΔEv, making them less reactive. The ability to maintain a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycle, as seen in the nanorods, is key to sustained catalytic performance. Thus, ΔEv serves as an indicator of how easily the catalyst can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, directly impacting its oxidizing ability and overall catalytic activity.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及一个循环过程，其中氧化物表面被反应物（如CO）还原，产生氧空位，随后表面被气相氧重新氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv值对应于更容易形成氧空位的更活性表面，有利于氧化还原循环。这一点从暴露{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒比主要暴露{111}晶面的纳米颗粒具有更高反应性得到了证实。更稳定的{111}晶面具有更高的ΔEv，使其反应性较低。保持稳定的Ce4+/Ce3+氧化还原循环的能力，如在纳米棒中所观察到的，是维持催化性能的关键。因此，ΔEv作为催化剂参与Mars-van Krevelen机理容易程度的指标，直接影响其氧化能力和整体催化活性。
