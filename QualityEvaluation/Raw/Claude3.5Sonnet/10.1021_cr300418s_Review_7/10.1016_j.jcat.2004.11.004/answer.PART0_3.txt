[1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

[2] "It is well known that there are three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure, namely the very stable and neutral {111} plane, the less stable {110} plane, and the higher-energy {001} plane [22]. Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the reoxidation of the surface by O2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values generally correspond to higher reactivity, as it is easier to create oxygen vacancies and maintain the redox cycle. The crystal planes of the oxide play a significant role, with less stable planes like {001} and {110} typically having lower ΔEv and thus higher reactivity compared to more stable planes like {111}. This explains why CeO2 nanorods exposing more {001} and {110} planes show higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to nanoparticles predominantly exposing {111} planes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及反应物（如CO）对氧化物表面的还原，创造氧空位，随后O2对表面的再氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对决定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值通常对应于更高的反应活性，因为更容易创造氧空位并维持氧化还原循环。氧化物的晶面结构起着重要作用，像{001}和{110}这样不太稳定的晶面通常具有较低的ΔEv，因此比{111}等更稳定的晶面具有更高的反应活性。这解释了为什么暴露更多{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒在CO氧化反应中表现出比主要暴露{111}晶面的纳米颗粒更高的催化活性。
