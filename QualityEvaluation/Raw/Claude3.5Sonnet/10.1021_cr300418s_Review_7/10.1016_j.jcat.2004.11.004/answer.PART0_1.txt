[1] "In general, high-surface-area nanocatalytic materials exhibiting numerous crystal faces, edges, and corners, which are conventionally considered active sites for the adsorption of reactants [4,5,28], should generate better catalytic performance."

[2] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen [30,31]."

[3] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive [1921]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the reoxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

Lower ΔEv values generally correspond to higher catalytic activity, as it is easier to create oxygen vacancies and maintain the redox cycle. Surfaces with lower stability, such as the {001} and {110} planes in CeO2, typically have lower ΔEv and are more reactive. Conversely, more stable surfaces like the {111} plane in CeO2 have higher ΔEv and are less reactive.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. Surfaces with lower ΔEv can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction, but if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become over-reduced and lose its catalytic activity. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv is necessary to balance reactivity and stability for effective catalysis.

In the context of the study, CeO2 nanorods exposing the more reactive {001} and {110} planes showed higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to nanoparticles predominantly exposing the stable {111} planes, demonstrating the significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及反应物（如CO）还原氧化物表面，创造氧空位，然后气相氧重新氧化表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv值通常对应于更高的催化活性，因为更容易创造氧空位并维持氧化还原循环。稳定性较低的表面，如CeO2中的{001}和{110}平面，通常具有较低的ΔEv并且更具反应性。相反，更稳定的表面如CeO2中的{111}平面具有较高的ΔEv，反应性较低。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv影响。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，但如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其催化活性。因此，需要最佳的ΔEv来平衡反应性和稳定性，以实现有效的催化。

在这项研究中，暴露出更具反应性的{001}和{110}平面的CeO2纳米棒与主要暴露稳定{111}平面的纳米颗粒相比，显示出更高的CO氧化催化活性，这证明了ΔEv在决定催化性能方面的重要性。
