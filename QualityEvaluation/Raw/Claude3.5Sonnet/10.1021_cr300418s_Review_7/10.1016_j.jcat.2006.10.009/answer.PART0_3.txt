[1] "An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[3] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive. In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there. One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxygen vacancy in the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of surface oxygen removal and replenishment. The process begins with a surface oxygen atom reacting with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy then adsorbs oxygen from the gas phase, which becomes activated and ready to participate in further oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a more reactive surface, as it means the oxygen atoms are more easily removed from the surface to participate in oxidation reactions. This is why doping oxides can enhance their catalytic activity - dopants often weaken the bond between oxygen and the oxide, lowering the ΔEv.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv can increase the oxidizing ability of the surface, it doesn't necessarily translate directly to higher catalytic activity. The overall catalytic performance depends on a balance between two factors: the ease of oxygen removal (related to ΔEv) and the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen. An optimal catalyst needs to strike a balance between these two processes to maintain a continuous catalytic cycle.

Therefore, while ΔEv is a useful measure of the oxide's oxidizing capacity, it should not be considered the sole determinant of catalytic activity. The ability to heal vacancies and maintain the catalytic cycle is equally important for sustained catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过表面氧的移除和补充循环来运作。该过程始于表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物并在表面创造氧空位。这个空位随后吸附气相氧，使其被激活并准备参与进一步的氧化反应。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示表面更具反应性，因为这意味着氧原子更容易从表面移除以参与氧化反应。这就是为什么掺杂氧化物可以提高其催化活性 - 掺杂剂通常会削弱氧与氧化物之间的键合，从而降低ΔEv。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv可以增加表面的氧化能力，但它并不一定直接转化为更高的催化活性。整体催化性能取决于两个因素之间的平衡：氧的易移除性（与ΔEv相关）和通过吸附和激活气相氧来修复空位的能力。最佳催化剂需要在这两个过程之间取得平衡，以维持持续的催化循环。

因此，虽然ΔEv是衡量氧化物氧化能力的有用指标，但不应将其视为决定催化活性的唯一因素。修复空位和维持催化循环的能力对于持续的催化性能同样重要。
