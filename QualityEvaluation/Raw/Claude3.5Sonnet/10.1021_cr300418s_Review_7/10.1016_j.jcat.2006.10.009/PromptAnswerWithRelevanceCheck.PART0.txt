[1] "An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."

[3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[4] "In this scenario, doping improves the catalytic properties of the surface if it satisfies two conflicting requirements. On the one hand, it must weaken the bond of the oxygen atoms to the oxide surface to allow the oxidation of the gas-phase reactant; on the other hand, this weakening must not be so pronounced that the vacancy can not be healed by reaction with gas-phase oxygen."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves two key steps:

1. A surface oxygen atom reacts with a gas-phase reducing agent to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface.

2. The oxygen vacancy is then healed by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Oxidizing ability: A lower ΔEv indicates a weaker bond between oxygen and the oxide, which increases the oxide's oxidizing capacity. This allows oxidation reactions to occur at lower temperatures.

2. Catalytic activity: However, ΔEv alone does not determine catalytic activity. While a lower ΔEv facilitates the first step of the mechanism, the catalyst must also be able to efficiently heal the vacancy by reacting with gas-phase oxygen.

The ideal catalyst strikes a balance between these two requirements: it must weaken the oxygen-oxide bond enough to allow oxidation of gas-phase reactants, but not so much that the vacancy cannot be healed by gas-phase oxygen. This balance is crucial for maintaining sustained catalytic activity.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及两个关键步骤：

1. 表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面氧空位。

2. 氧空位随后通过吸附和活化气相氧而被修复。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都很重要：

1. 氧化能力：较低的ΔEv表示氧与氧化物之间的键合较弱，这增加了氧化物的氧化能力。这允许氧化反应在较低的温度下进行。

2. 催化活性：然而，ΔEv alone并不决定催化活性。虽然较低的ΔEv有助于机制的第一步，但催化剂还必须能够通过与气相氧反应有效地修复空位。

理想的催化剂在这两个要求之间取得平衡：它必须足够削弱氧-氧化物键以允许气相反应物的氧化，但不能削弱到空位无法被气相氧修复的程度。这种平衡对于维持持续的催化活性至关重要。

1. A surface oxygen atom reacts with a gas-phase reducing agent to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface.

2. The oxygen vacancy is then healed by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for the following reasons:

1. Oxidizing ability: A lower ΔEv indicates that the bond between oxygen and the oxide surface is weaker, making it easier for the surface oxygen to participate in oxidation reactions. This can be used as a measure of the oxide's oxidizing capacity.

2. Catalytic activity: While a lower ΔEv generally enhances the oxide's ability to oxidize gas-phase reactants, it does not directly correlate with overall catalytic activity. This is because the catalyst must also be able to efficiently heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen.

3. Temperature dependence: The high energy typically required for oxygen vacancy formation is one reason why oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions often occur at high temperatures. Lowering ΔEv can potentially reduce the temperature at which these reactions take place.

4. Balancing act: An effective oxide catalyst must strike a balance between having a low enough ΔEv to allow for facile oxidation of gas-phase reactants, but not so low that it hinders the healing of oxygen vacancies by gas-phase oxygen.

In summary, while ΔEv is a crucial factor in determining an oxide's oxidizing ability, its relationship with overall catalytic activity is more complex and depends on the balance between vacancy formation and healing processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理包含两个关键步骤：

1. 表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面氧空位。

2. 氧空位随后通过吸附和活化气相氧来修复。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 氧化能力：较低的ΔEv表明氧与氧化物表面之间的键合较弱，使表面氧更容易参与氧化反应。这可以用作衡量氧化物氧化能力的指标。

2. 催化活性：虽然较低的ΔEv通常会增强氧化物氧化气相反应物的能力，但它与整体催化活性并不直接相关。这是因为催化剂还必须能够通过吸附和活化气相氧有效地修复空位。

3. 温度依赖性：氧空位形成通常需要高能量，这是氧化物催化氧化反应常常在高温下进行的原因之一。降低ΔEv可能会降低这些反应发生的温度。

4. 平衡act：有效的氧化物催化剂必须在ΔEv足够低以允许气相反应物容易氧化，但又不至于低到阻碍气相氧修复氧空位之间取得平衡。

总之，虽然ΔEv是决定氧化物氧化能力的关键因素，但它与整体催化活性的关系更为复杂，取决于空位形成和修复过程之间的平衡。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the oxide surface and subsequent vacancy healing. The process begins when a surface oxygen atom reacts with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy then adsorbs oxygen from the gas phase, which becomes activated in the electron-rich environment of the vacancy. The activated oxygen can then oxidize another gas-phase molecule, while the remaining oxygen atom heals the vacancy.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing capacity of the oxide, as it suggests that surface oxygen atoms are more easily removed and thus more reactive. This is why doping oxides can enhance their catalytic activity - dopants often weaken the bond between oxygen and the oxide, lowering the ΔEv.

However, it's crucial to note that ΔEv alone does not determine catalytic activity. While a lower ΔEv can facilitate the initial oxidation step, the overall catalytic efficiency also depends on the ability of the surface to heal its vacancies by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen. An optimal catalyst must balance these two aspects: it must have surface oxygen that is reactive enough to participate in oxidation reactions, but not so reactive that it hinders the healing of oxygen vacancies. This balance is key to maintaining the catalytic cycle and ensuring efficient oxidation reactions at lower temperatures.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过氧从氧化物表面移除和随后的空位愈合的循环过程来运作。该过程始于表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物并在表面创造氧空位。然后，这个空位吸附气相氧，在空位的富电子环境中被活化。活化的氧可以氧化另一个气相分子，而剩余的氧原子则愈合空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物具有更高的氧化能力，因为它意味着表面氧原子更容易被移除，因此更具反应性。这就是为什么掺杂氧化物可以增强其催化活性 - 掺杂剂通常会削弱氧与氧化物之间的键，降低ΔEv。

然而，需要注意的是，ΔEv alone并不决定催化活性。虽然较低的ΔEv可以促进初始氧化步骤，但整体催化效率还取决于表面通过吸附和活化气相氧来愈合其空位的能力。最佳催化剂必须平衡这两个方面：它必须具有足够反应性的表面氧以参与氧化反应，但又不能过于反应以至于阻碍氧空位的愈合。这种平衡对于维持催化循环和确保在较低温度下进行高效氧化反应至关重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of surface oxygen removal and replenishment. The process begins with a surface oxygen atom reacting with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy then adsorbs oxygen from the gas phase, which becomes activated and ready to participate in further oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a more reactive surface, as it means the oxygen atoms are more easily removed from the surface to participate in oxidation reactions. This is why doping oxides can enhance their catalytic activity - dopants often weaken the bond between oxygen and the oxide, lowering the ΔEv.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv can increase the oxidizing ability of the surface, it doesn't necessarily translate directly to higher catalytic activity. The overall catalytic performance depends on a balance between two factors: the ease of oxygen removal (related to ΔEv) and the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen. An optimal catalyst needs to strike a balance between these two processes to maintain a continuous catalytic cycle.

Therefore, while ΔEv is a useful measure of the oxide's oxidizing capacity, it should not be considered the sole determinant of catalytic activity. The ability to heal vacancies and maintain the catalytic cycle is equally important for sustained catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过表面氧的移除和补充循环来运作。该过程始于表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物并在表面创造氧空位。这个空位随后吸附气相氧，使其被激活并准备参与进一步的氧化反应。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示表面更具反应性，因为这意味着氧原子更容易从表面移除以参与氧化反应。这就是为什么掺杂氧化物可以提高其催化活性 - 掺杂剂通常会削弱氧与氧化物之间的键合，从而降低ΔEv。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv可以增加表面的氧化能力，但它并不一定直接转化为更高的催化活性。整体催化性能取决于两个因素之间的平衡：氧的易移除性（与ΔEv相关）和通过吸附和激活气相氧来修复空位的能力。最佳催化剂需要在这两个过程之间取得平衡，以维持持续的催化循环。

因此，虽然ΔEv是衡量氧化物氧化能力的有用指标，但不应将其视为决定催化活性的唯一因素。修复空位和维持催化循环的能力对于持续的催化性能同样重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It indicates the ease of removing oxygen from the surface, which is a key step in the oxidation process. A lower ΔEv suggests that the surface oxygen is more reactive and can more easily participate in oxidation reactions.

2. ΔEv is related to the temperature at which oxidation reactions occur. A high ΔEv is one reason why some oxides only perform oxidation reactions at high temperatures. Lowering ΔEv, for example by doping, can potentially lower the reaction temperature.

3. ΔEv can be used as a measure of the oxidizing capacity of an oxide. However, it's important to note that ΔEv alone does not determine catalytic activity, as the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen is also crucial.

4. In doped oxides, the dopant typically weakens the bond between the oxide and surface oxygen atoms, effectively lowering ΔEv and making the surface oxygen more reactive.

However, there's a balance to be struck. While a lower ΔEv can make oxygen removal easier, if it's too low, it might hinder the ability of the surface to heal vacancies with gas-phase oxygen. Therefore, an effective catalyst needs to optimize both oxygen removal and vacancy healing processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面氧原子与气相还原剂的反应，形成氧化产物和表面氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它表明从表面去除氧的难易程度，这是氧化过程的关键步骤。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更具反应性，更容易参与氧化反应。

2. ΔEv与氧化反应发生的温度有关。高ΔEv是某些氧化物只在高温下进行氧化反应的原因之一。降低ΔEv，例如通过掺杂，可能会降低反应温度。

3. ΔEv可用作衡量氧化物氧化能力的指标。然而，重要的是要注意，ΔEv本身并不决定催化活性，因为吸附和激活气相氧以修复空位的能力也至关重要。

4. 在掺杂的氧化物中，掺杂剂通常会削弱氧化物与表面氧原子之间的键合，有效降低ΔEv并使表面氧更具反应性。

然而，需要取得平衡。虽然较低的ΔEv可以使氧的去除更容易，但如果它太低，可能会阻碍表面利用气相氧修复空位的能力。因此，有效的催化剂需要优化氧去除和空位修复这两个过程。
