[1] "An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."

[3] "However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[4] "In this scenario, doping improves the catalytic properties of the surface if it satisfies two conflicting requirements. On the one hand, it must weaken the bond of the oxygen atoms to the oxide surface to allow the oxidation of the gas-phase reactant; on the other hand, this weakening must not be so pronounced that the vacancy can not be healed by reaction with gas-phase oxygen."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves two key steps:

1. A surface oxygen atom reacts with a gas-phase reducing agent to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface.

2. The oxygen vacancy is then healed by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Oxidizing ability: A lower ΔEv indicates a weaker bond between oxygen and the oxide, which increases the oxide's oxidizing capacity. This allows oxidation reactions to occur at lower temperatures.

2. Catalytic activity: However, ΔEv alone does not determine catalytic activity. While a lower ΔEv facilitates the first step of the mechanism, the catalyst must also be able to efficiently heal the vacancy by reacting with gas-phase oxygen.

The ideal catalyst strikes a balance between these two requirements: it must weaken the oxygen-oxide bond enough to allow oxidation of gas-phase reactants, but not so much that the vacancy cannot be healed by gas-phase oxygen. This balance is crucial for maintaining sustained catalytic activity.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及两个关键步骤：

1. 表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面氧空位。

2. 氧空位随后通过吸附和活化气相氧而被修复。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都很重要：

1. 氧化能力：较低的ΔEv表示氧与氧化物之间的键合较弱，这增加了氧化物的氧化能力。这允许氧化反应在较低的温度下进行。

2. 催化活性：然而，ΔEv alone并不决定催化活性。虽然较低的ΔEv有助于机制的第一步，但催化剂还必须能够通过与气相氧反应有效地修复空位。

理想的催化剂在这两个要求之间取得平衡：它必须足够削弱氧-氧化物键以允许气相反应物的氧化，但不能削弱到空位无法被气相氧修复的程度。这种平衡对于维持持续的催化活性至关重要。
