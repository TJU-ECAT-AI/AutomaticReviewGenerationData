[1] "An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

[2] "The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature. We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide."

[3] "Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[4] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive. In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there. One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxygen vacancy in the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It indicates the ease of removing oxygen from the surface, which is a key step in the oxidation process. A lower ΔEv suggests that the surface oxygen is more reactive and can more easily participate in oxidation reactions.

2. ΔEv is related to the temperature at which oxidation reactions occur. A high ΔEv is one reason why some oxides only perform oxidation reactions at high temperatures. Lowering ΔEv, for example by doping, can potentially lower the reaction temperature.

3. ΔEv can be used as a measure of the oxidizing capacity of an oxide. However, it's important to note that ΔEv alone does not determine catalytic activity, as the ability to heal the vacancy by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen is also crucial.

4. In doped oxides, the dopant typically weakens the bond between the oxide and surface oxygen atoms, effectively lowering ΔEv and making the surface oxygen more reactive.

However, there's a balance to be struck. While a lower ΔEv can make oxygen removal easier, if it's too low, it might hinder the ability of the surface to heal vacancies with gas-phase oxygen. Therefore, an effective catalyst needs to optimize both oxygen removal and vacancy healing processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面氧原子与气相还原剂的反应，形成氧化产物和表面氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它表明从表面去除氧的难易程度，这是氧化过程的关键步骤。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更具反应性，更容易参与氧化反应。

2. ΔEv与氧化反应发生的温度有关。高ΔEv是某些氧化物只在高温下进行氧化反应的原因之一。降低ΔEv，例如通过掺杂，可能会降低反应温度。

3. ΔEv可用作衡量氧化物氧化能力的指标。然而，重要的是要注意，ΔEv本身并不决定催化活性，因为吸附和激活气相氧以修复空位的能力也至关重要。

4. 在掺杂的氧化物中，掺杂剂通常会削弱氧化物与表面氧原子之间的键合，有效降低ΔEv并使表面氧更具反应性。

然而，需要取得平衡。虽然较低的ΔEv可以使氧的去除更容易，但如果它太低，可能会阻碍表面利用气相氧修复空位的能力。因此，有效的催化剂需要优化氧去除和空位修复这两个过程。
