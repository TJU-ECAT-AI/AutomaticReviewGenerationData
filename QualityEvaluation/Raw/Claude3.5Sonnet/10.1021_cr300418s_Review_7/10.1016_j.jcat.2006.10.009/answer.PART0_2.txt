[1] "An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

[2] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

[3] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive. In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there. One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxygen vacancy in the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the oxide surface and subsequent vacancy healing. The process begins when a surface oxygen atom reacts with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy then adsorbs oxygen from the gas phase, which becomes activated in the electron-rich environment of the vacancy. The activated oxygen can then oxidize another gas-phase molecule, while the remaining oxygen atom heals the vacancy.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing capacity of the oxide, as it suggests that surface oxygen atoms are more easily removed and thus more reactive. This is why doping oxides can enhance their catalytic activity - dopants often weaken the bond between oxygen and the oxide, lowering the ΔEv.

However, it's crucial to note that ΔEv alone does not determine catalytic activity. While a lower ΔEv can facilitate the initial oxidation step, the overall catalytic efficiency also depends on the ability of the surface to heal its vacancies by adsorbing and activating gas-phase oxygen. An optimal catalyst must balance these two aspects: it must have surface oxygen that is reactive enough to participate in oxidation reactions, but not so reactive that it hinders the healing of oxygen vacancies. This balance is key to maintaining the catalytic cycle and ensuring efficient oxidation reactions at lower temperatures.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过氧从氧化物表面移除和随后的空位愈合的循环过程来运作。该过程始于表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物并在表面创造氧空位。然后，这个空位吸附气相氧，在空位的富电子环境中被活化。活化的氧可以氧化另一个气相分子，而剩余的氧原子则愈合空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物具有更高的氧化能力，因为它意味着表面氧原子更容易被移除，因此更具反应性。这就是为什么掺杂氧化物可以增强其催化活性 - 掺杂剂通常会削弱氧与氧化物之间的键，降低ΔEv。

然而，需要注意的是，ΔEv alone并不决定催化活性。虽然较低的ΔEv可以促进初始氧化步骤，但整体催化效率还取决于表面通过吸附和活化气相氧来愈合其空位的能力。最佳催化剂必须平衡这两个方面：它必须具有足够反应性的表面氧以参与氧化反应，但又不能过于反应以至于阻碍氧空位的愈合。这种平衡对于维持催化循环和确保在较低温度下进行高效氧化反应至关重要。
