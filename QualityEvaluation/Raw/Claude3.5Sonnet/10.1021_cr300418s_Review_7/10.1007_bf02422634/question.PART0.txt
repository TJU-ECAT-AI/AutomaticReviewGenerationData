An analysis of the electron spin resonance spectrum of smoky quartz shows that the 
paramagnetic center is formed by a defect electron, trapped at one of the four oxygen ligands 
around a substitutional 
aluminum 
impurity ion. According to the C2-symmetry of a metal site 
in -SiO2, two of these oxygen sites form slightly deeper traps for the hole. If trapped at one of 
the remaining 
two ligands, the hole is in an excited state, z]E  0.030 eV. Thermally activated 
hopping of the hole among these oxygen sites accounts for the disappearance of the ESR- 
spectrum, above 170 
as well as for the occurrence of dielectric loss in smoky quartz. The 
electronic structure of the trapped hole center is discussed by crystal field theory, appropriate 
for an O--ion, which also accounts adequately for the experimental g-shift data.

1. Introduction 
It is well known that quartz crystals (Si02) can be readily darkened by exposure 
to ionizing radiation. Such "smoky" quartz crystals also occur frequently in 
nature. Obviously, a defect center must be involved for producing this charac- 
teristic coloration. It has been observed that already soft X-rays may produce the 
color centers. Therefore, it appears to be rather likely, that the color centers are

Fig. 1. Arrangement of silicon and oxygen atoms in the a-quartz lattice, as projected on the 
plane perpendicular to the c-axis: right-handed levorotary modification, P3121. There are 
three different metal sites, each being surrounded by two sets of oxygen atoms. Therefore, two 
sets of six equivalent oxygen sites can be distinguished 
formed by ionisation of defects, which were present in the lattice already before 
irradiation. 
O'Brien [1] has presented strong evidence that the coloration of smoky quartz 
is due to aluminum impurity ions which occupy substitutional silicon sites in the 
Si02 lattice, see Fig. 1. Her eonlusions were mainly based on the results of an 
analysis of the characteristic electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of smoky 
quartz, which was first reported by Griffiths, Owen and Ward [2]. According to 
O'Brien, the paramagnetic color center is formed when a radiation-induced defect 
electron (hole) has become trapped at the oxygen ligands around the aluminum 
impurity site. The hole prefers to stay localized at the oxygen ligands, because the 
ionisation of an A13+ ion would require more than 100 eV. Of course, this argument 
implies the -- reasonable -- assumption that the bond character of quartz is 
dominantly ionic. 
Later work has shown that the kinetics of the creation of the color centers in 
smoky quartz are not that simple. Before irradiation, we are dealing with sub- 
stitutional trivalent aluminum ions which are charge deficient with respect to the 
silicon atoms of the host lattice. Charge compensation of these defects may be 
achieved by association of the substitutional aluminum ions with interstitial mono- 
valent impurity ions, as Li 
+ and Na +, and also with protons, H+. Although being 
charge-compensated, these associate defect centers still have the ability to trap a 
hole, which will be again localized at the oxygen ligands around the impurity site. 
This was shown by Mackey's ESg-analysis [3] of quartz crystals X-irradiated not 
at room temperature, but at 77  
Whereas the presence of AV 
7 in the para- 
magnetic centers was unambiguously demonstrated by a ligand hyperfine structure, 
the presence of the monovalent charge-compensators, H +, Li 
+ or Na+, could only

be indirectly detected, viz. by their different influence on the g-tensor and on the 
A127 hypcrfine structure. However, as the crystals were annealed at 300  -- and 
subsequently re-measured at 77  
-- these spectra faded and the ESR-spectrum 
of the "normal", unassociated aluminum color center recovered. Mackey's observa- 
tions show that these interstitial ions are still mobile in the lattice below room 
temperature. They diffuse away, after their charge compensating role has been 
taken over by the umpaired defect electron, which is more tightly bound at the 
aluminum impurity site. 
Because of their considerable mobility, which increases further strongly with 
temperature, interstitial alkali ions can be entirely removed from the SiO2 crystal 
by electrolysis, at temperatures above 1000 
The alkali ions will then be de- 
posited at the cathode and, for reasons of charge-neutrality, holes will be injected 
into the crystal from the anode, which will subsequently be trapped at the alu- 
minum impurity sites. In this way, the smoky coloration of quartz can also be 
generated electrolytically [4]. 
The role of interstitial alkali ions as charge-compensators has also been rather 
convincingly demonstrated by ESR-investigations of germanium-doped quartz 
[3, 5]. Tetravalent germanium ions represent isoelectronic impurity ions in the 
SiO2 lattice. Nevertheless, they still have the ability to trap an electron and they 
are then present as paramagnetic, 2S1/2-state Ge 
3+ ions, 4s 
1, which are no longer 
charge-compensated. If these Ge 
3+ ions are generated by X-it'radiation at 77  
they stay locally charge-uncompensated. However, as the temperature is increased, 
interstitial alkali ions become sufficiently mobile and will subsequently be bound 
at the Ge 
3+ impurity sites. 
Charge-compensation by association with interstitial alkali ions has also been 
observed by ESR for the trivalent impurity ions Ti 
3+, 3d 1, and Fe 
8+, 3d 5, in 
quartz [6, 7]. 
In this paper, the results of a more detailed analysis of the ESI and optical 
spectra of the unassociated aluminum color center in smoky quartz will be pres- 
ented. In particular, it will be shown that the unpaired hole can be trapped at two 
different types of oxygen ligands around the aluminum impurity ion. This can be 
understood by closer inspection of the local symmetry around a metal site in the 
-Si02 lattice, which corresponds to that of a slightly distorted tetrahedron, C2. 
Consequently, there are two equivalent oxygen ligands which are slightly closer to 
the central metal ion than the remaining two oxygen ligands [8]. If trapped at 
these closer oxygen ligands, the hole is in its ground state, in the following labeled 
as GS. Since there are three metal sites in the unit cell of a-quartz, six different GS 
centers can be distinguished by ESR. These are the well known smoky quartz color 
centers, first observed by Griffiths, Owen and Ward [2], at 77  
However, a rather 
small energy, 0.03 eV, is required to lift the hole to the two equivalent, slightly 
more distant oxygen ligands of the metal ion, which represent an excited state, 
ES, for the unpaired hole. In addition to the six GS centers, we could therefore 
detect six ES centers by ESR. 
At 77 
more than 98 of the trapped holes are localized at those oxygen 
ligands which represent the ground state, whereas at 300 
already 25% of the 
holes occupy the more distant oxygen sites which represent the excited state of the 
aluminum color center in smoky quartz. 
22 
R. Sehnadt and J. Schneider: 
At elevated temperature, a thermally activated hopping of the hole among these 
four oxygen sites, around one particular metal site, occurs. This hopping of the 
holes must be made responsible for part of the dielectric and aneleastic loss 
occurring in X-irradiated quartz. 
Survey ESR-measurements were also performed on X-irradiated gallium- 
doped quartz. Here, a gallium color center was observed, which seems to be 
analogous to that occuring in aluminum-doped quartz. 
2. Crystal Preparation and Crystallography of -Quartz 
We have investigated a large number of natural and synthetic smoky quartz 
crystals. Part of the synthetic samples had been purposely doped with aluminum 
during the hydrothermal growth. The maximum, spectrographically determined 
aluminum content in these samples was about 150 ppm. The crystals were colored 
by irradiation with 50 keV X-rays, up to 106 tad, at room temperature. Some of 
the samples had also been colored electrolytically. 
At this occassion, some crystallographic data for -quartz should be compiled 
which will be needed later for the discussion of the structure of the color center. 
Low, or -quartz is the stable lattice modification of Si02 at temperatures below 
573  
The lattice type of -quartz is trigonal and belongs to the point group 32 
(1)3). Symmetry elements are one threefold axis (optical or c-axis) and, perpendi- 
cular to this, three twofold, piezoelectric axes (a-axes). There are three silicon 
atoms and six oxygen atoms per unit cell. Each silicon atom lies on one of the 
three twofold axes, whereas the six oxygen sites do not contain symmetry elements, 
see Fig. I. Each silicon atom is surrounded by a slightly distorted terahedron of 
oxygen ligands having C2-symmetry. Each oxygen atom forms an almost isosceles 
triangle with its two silicon ligands, the bond angle being about 144 
 
e-quartz crystallizes in two enantiomorphous space groups, P 3121 (D) and 
P 3221 (Dar which, because of their optical activity, are called levo- and dextro- 
rotary quartz, whereas their structural hands are right and left. These two struc- 
tures cannot be distinguished by ESR. This is also true for crystals with optical or 
Brazil twinning. In contrast, twinning according to the Dauphin6 twin law can be 
detected by ESR, provided the paramagnctic center in question has a sufficiently 
low symmetry, as c.g. the color centers in smoky quartz. In this case, twelve 
different magnetic sites occur. However, none of the crystals investigated showed 
Dauphin6 twinning. 
3. Experimental Results 
3.1 Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) 
ESR-spectra of smoky quartz were recorded on the Varian V-4502 spectro- 
meter system operating at 9 GHz and at 35 GHz. The spectra can be observed at 
liquid nitrogen temperature. However, it is found that the ESR-lines rapidly 
broaden beyond detection as the temperature is raised above 170  
The fading 
of the ESR-spectrum is not caused by thermal destruction of the paramagnetic 
center in question. As will he discussed later, the disappearance of the ESI%- 
spectrum at temperatures above 170  is caused by the rapid, thermally activated 
hopping of the unpaired spin between the oxygen ligands around the aluminum 
impurity site.

3.1.1 Analysis of the Ground State Center 
At 9 GHz, the ESR-spectrum of smoky quartz is of considerable complexity. 
For an arbitrary orientation of the crystal in the magnetic field, six magnetically 
inequivalent sites for the paramagnetic centers can be distinguished -- ff the 
unpaired spins are in their ground state. These six sites become magnetically 
identical for H//c. However, instead of a regular sextet hyperfine pattern which 
might be expected from the interaction of the unpaired spin with the nuclear 
spin I = 5/2 of the A127 impurity ligand, a rather complicated hyperfine pattern 
consisting of 21 lines is observed, see Fig. 2. Note, that the spectrum shown in 
Fig. 2 was recorded at 20  
where the width of an individual line has already 
decreased to its low temperature limit (about 0.2 gauss in several samples in- 
vestigated). 
The large number of lines in an individual hyperfine pattern is probably caused 
by a strong nuclear quadrupole interaction. In this case, forbidden hyperfine 
transitions zJm -- =J= 1,  2 are expected to appear in the ESR-spectrum. The 
intensity of these forbidden transitions was found to be considerably reduced if the 
ESR-spcctra were recorded at 35 GHz. At this frequency, rather regular, almost 
isotropic sextet hyperfinc patterns were observed for each individual magnetic 
site. Therefore, if not stated otherwise, all ESR-data to be reported were taken at 
35 GHz. Unfortunately, the 35 GHz spectrometer which was at our disposal did 
not permit measurements at temperatures below 77  
As mentioned above, the paramagnetic center has sixfold site degeneracy and 
six different ESR-signals are consequently observed, for an arbitrary orientation of 
the crystal in the magnetic field. As shown in Fig. 3, these signals coincide by 
symmetry for H//c. For H//a and H//b three magnetically different sites for the 
paramagnetic center are predicted by symmetry, but only two ESR-signals are

detected, see Fig. 3. Apparently, the high field signal in the spectrum H//a and 
the low field signal for H//b have accidental fourfold degeneracy. 
The angular dependence of the six ESl%-signals of the aluminum color center in 
its ground state upon rotating the crystal around the three principal axes b, c, a is 
shown in Fig. 4. Note that the twofold degeneracy of each branch in the angular 
dependence diagram b--> c is required by symmetry, whereas in the diagram 
a - b it is only accidental. The principal values of the g-tensor were determined 
by a computer least square fit 1 of the angular dependence data2: 
gl = 2.0614  0.0003 
g2 = 2.0091 = 0.0003 
g3 = 2.0024 = 0.0003 
In this analysis, only the experimental points in the angular dependence c - a 
were used to determine the g-tensor components and their orientation. From these 
parameters, the solid curves in Fig. 4 have been calculated, also for the angular 
dependence a--> b and b- c. These curves are seen to give a good fit to the 
experimental points. 
In the analysis above, field positions of the signals were measured by proton 
NMR, whereas the microwave frequency was determined by means of a ZnS : Mn2+ 
powder sample, which was simultaneously introduced into the microwave cavity. 
The g-factor and the Mn 
55 hyperfine splitting of the Mn 
2+ ion in this host had been 
previously determined with high accuracy [9]. 
The experimental data for the g-tensor components, as listed above, fall within 
the range of experimental error of data previously reported by Griffiths, Owen 
and Ward [2] and by Weawer and Schindler [10]. However, these authors worked 
mainly at 9 GHz and, consequently, their data include a larger experimental error. 
Similarly, the orientations of the principal axes of the g-tensor were deter- 
mined. They were described by the angles Ol and l, where  measures the tilting 
away from the c-axis and i measures the tilting away from an a-axis, in the plane 
perpendicular to c. We obtain:

The maximum uncertainty of these angles is about 0.2

The above given angles of orientation are those for the g-tensor of the centers 
in the position labeled 1 1 in Fig. 4. The orientation for the five other positions of

No attempt was made to determine the parameters of the A127

rotating the crystal around the principal axes b, c and a. The indices refer to the six diffe- 
rent sites of the color centers, see Sect. 3.3.1 
Fig. 2, weak satellite lines can be detected. These arise from an additional hyperfinc 
interaction of the unpaired spin with the nuclear spin I -- 1/2 ofa Si 
29 ligand. The 
natural abundance of this isotope is only 4.7/o . For H//c 
the total Si 
29 hyperfine 
splitting amounts to 11.4 gauss. Similarly, Si 
29 satellite lines have been observed 
in the ESR-spectrum of the excited state center to be described in the next Section. 
3.1.2 Analysis of the Excited State Center 
Closer inspection of the ESR-spectra recorded at 100  
as shown in Fig. 3, 
reveals the presence of additional very weak sextet signals with a hyperfine 
splitting comparable to that of the ground state center. The angular dependence 
of these satellite signals is shown in Fig. 5. The paramagnetic center responsible 
is seen to have again sixfold site degeneracy. However, one notes that in the present 
ease there are no longer accidental degeneracies upon rotating the crystal around 
the c-axis. Here, the principal values of the g-tensor were determined as 
g* = 2.0568 • 0.0003 
g2* = 2.0091  0.0003 
g* = 2.0026 -4- 0.0003

distant oxygen ligands around a substitutional aluminum ion. At these sites, the

N*/N 
= e -E/T , 
where N is the number of spins in the ground state, represented by the two nearer 
oxygen ligands. The encrgetical separation of the excited state from the ground 
state, dE, could be determined from the ratio of the absolute intensities of the 
excited and ground state center ESR-signals. At 100 
this ratio was N*/N 
0.031, yielding 
2E = 30  6 meV. 
With this value, the population of the excited state, N*/N, is plotted as a function 
of temperature in Fig. 6. At room temperature already about 25% of the centers 
are in their excited state. The decrease of the intensity of the satellite lines, i.e. the 
thermal freeze-out of the excited state could be monitored down to 30  
at 9 GHz. 
Experimental values, as obtained for N*/1V in this temperature range, have also 
been included in Fig. 6. These data are somewhat less reliable than the measure- 
ment performed at 100

to an angle of about 60

originate from holes trapped at the same aluminum impurity site. This assignment 
was rendered possible as we had at our disposal a smoky quartz sample which 
exhibited a pronounced pleochroism 4. 
In the ESR-spectrum of this pleoehroitie sample, only two dominant sets of 
GS A127 hyperfine patterns can be detected, see Fig. 7. The remaining four GS 
signals can also be recognized in the spectrum, but their intensity is seen to be 
greatly reduced. Closer inspection of the spectrum also reveals the presence of only 
two dominant signals arising from centers in the excited state. The angular depen- 
dence of the two dominant GS centers, upon rotating this crystal around the 
three different b-axes is shown in Fig. 8. 
We can therefore conclude that in this pleochroitic sample only one of the three 
silicon lattice sites is noticably occupied by an aluminum impurity ion. The 
occupation numbers are about 28 : 1.7 : 1, as estimated from the relative intensities 
of the ESR-signals originating from the three different aluminum sites. Such 
samples are no longer optically uniaxial -- they exhibit a pronounced pleo- 
ehroism [12]. 
From the ESR-analysis of pleochroitie smoky quartz, a very direct assignment 
of the different branches in the angular dependence diagrams, as shown in Figs. 4

hedral coordination. As already mentioned in Section 1, there are two equivalent 
oxygen ligands which are slightly closer to the central metal ion than the remaining 
two oxygen ligands [8]. This will also be true if a silicon atom is replaced by an 
aluminum impurity. Consequently, if a hole is trapped at one of the four oxygen 
ligands around a given aluminum impurity, two types of paramagnetic centers can 
he expected to occur. The reason is that the hole can be localized either at one of 
the two nearer oxygen sites, or at one of the two more distant oxygen sites. We 
want to assign these two possible types of centers to the GS and ES centers, 
respectively. A justification for this assignment will be given in Sect. 4.2. 
All together, there are six GS sites and six ES sites in the Si02 lattice. These 
are labeled in Fig. 9. According to the ESR-spectrum of our pleochroitic smoky 
30 
R. Schnadt and J. Schneider: 
quartz sample, as shown in Fig. 7, only one silicon site is dominantly occupied by 
an aluminum impurity ion. The corresponding oxygen ligand sites are 1 2, 2 1 for 
the GS centers and 1 1, 2 3 for the ES centers. This assignment, introduced in 
Fig. 9, had already been used in Figs. 4 and 5. 
Concerning the pleochroitic quartz, the observed site selectivity exhibited by 
the aluminum impurity ions must result from special conditions of crystalline 
growth. The reason is that the three metal sites in the quartz lattice -- although 
being energetically equivalent in the bulk crystal -- may be energetically different 
during the growth of the crystal 5. Subsequent thermal anneal at 600 for one 
hour rendered the crystal dichroitic again; this indicates that at these temperatures 
the mobility of the aluminum ions is sufficient to reestablish equal population in 
the three lattice sites [12]. 
We have seen that there are two equivalent GS oxygen ligand sites at which the 
unpaired spin can be trapped. Therefore, hopping of the spin between these two 
sites should occur. This has been observed by Taylor and Farneli [14] by two 
rather convincing experiments: 
1. By means of a microwave double resonance technique, it was observed that 
saturation of the ESR signal originating from a given GS oxygen site also saturates 
selectively one, and only one, of the remaining five GS signals. 
2. The thermal equilibrium of spins situated at equivalent adjacent GS oxygen 
sites can be changed by an externally applied electric field; the electrically induced 
change of the spin population was monitored by ESR. 
It was possible from both types of experiments, to assign in the angular 
dependence diagrams definitely one pair of branches to two GS oxygen sites 
bridged by a common aluminum ion. Tiffs assignment, as given by Taylor and 
Farnell [14], is identical to that given in the present paper. 
The thermally activated hopping of the spin between the two equivalent 
oxygen sites must also account for the rapid increase of the ESR-linewidth with 
temperature. At elevated temperatures, jumps between the GS and ES sites must 
also be considered. Attempts to rediscover a motionally averaged ESR-spectrum 
at more elevated temperatures, up to 520  
remained unsuccessful, at 9 GItz. 
Apparently, there is a high probability that the spin loses its phase memory during 
a hopping process. 
3.l.4 Gallium-Doped Quartz 
As will be shown later in the discussion, Section 4, the influence of the A1 
a+ 
impurity ion on the electronic structure of the color center in smoky quartz is of 
secondary importance; its main role being to provide the excess charge required to 
stabilize the unpaix'ed hole at an oxygen ligand. Therefore, this role should possibly 
also be taken over by another group-III impurity ion, as Ga 
a+, resulting in an 
almost quantitatively analogous color center. 
For this, we have investigated a gallium-doped quartz crystal, kindly provided 
to us by Sawyer Research Products. The sample had a spectrographic indication of 
45 ppm gallium. The crystal was X-irradiated at room temperature under the same 
5 Such situations had already been previously observed by ESR; e.g. in the case 
of Gd 
3+ 
ions in A12Oa, see Ref. [13]. 
The Electronic Structure of the Trapped-Hole Center in Smoky Quartz

conditions as aluminum-doped quartz. Again, no dominant ESR-spectrum could 
be detected at room temperature. At 77 
however, a novel ESR-speetrum 
appeared which we would like to assign to a gallium center, analogous to the 
aluminum center. As for the aluminum center there are 6 magnetically inequivalent 
sites of the gallium center for an arbitrary orientation of the crystal in the magnetic 
field. An exact analysis of the angular dependence of the ESR-spectra of this 
gallium center was rendered difficult for the following reasons: 
1. The samples investigated also exhibited the ESR-spectrum of the aluminum 
center which strongly overlapped with that of the gallium center, even at 35 GItz. 
The intensity of the aluminum spectrum was about one third of that of the 
gallium spectrum. 
2. Because of strong quadrupolar interaction, the hyperfine structure pattern 
does, even at 35 GHz, not show the familiar quartet pattern to be expected for the 
two stable I  3/2 gallium isotopes, Ga 
69 and Ga 
7i. Consequently, it was rather 
ambiguous to fix the center of the hyperfine pattern, from which the g-factor is 
determined. The total spread of the gallium hyperfine structure was about 
40 gauss and was found to be slightly angular dependent. 
For these reasons, quantitative values for the g-tensor components of the 
gallium center u,l ,-A*

spectra of the two centers suggests that their g-tensor components are very 
similar. For the gl-component of the galhum center we can predict a value of 
gl - 2.07 :L 0.01. In view of these findings, one can say that the electronic 
structure of the color center in gallium-doped quartz appears to be very similar to 
that of the aluminum center. Because of the complexity of the spectra it was 
impossible to identify the galhum ES centers. 
3.2 The Optical Absorption Spectrum o/ Smoky Quartz 
Polarized optical absorption spectra of several smoky quartz samples were 
recorded at 300  
77  and at 6  
between 300 nm and 1000 nm. For clarity 
only the results at 77 
and 6 
are shown in Fig. 10. One notes a broad, 
structureless absorption band which still extends rather far into the ultraviolet 
region. The cut-off at longer wavelenghts is more pronounced. Iqo zero-phonon 
line could be detected on the low energy wing of this absorption band, even at 
6  
The shape of the absorption band does not greatly change after cooling the 
crystal from 300 
to 77 
Our results on the optical absorption spectra of 
smoky quartz at 300  and at 77  
are in agreement with those obtained pre- 
viously by other workers [15]. 
4. Discussion 
4.1 Model 
The discussion of the structure of the paramagnetic color center in smoky 
quartz will heavily depend on the analysis of the experimental data obtained by 
ESI. This method appears to be best suited to gain insight into the chemical 
origin, the crystalline symmetry and the electronic structure of the paramagnetic 
lattice defect.

Fig. ii. Ligand field geometry for the aluminum color center. The O--ion is located at the 
origin. The z-axis lies perpendicular to the plane and is identical to the -axis. For further 
explanations see text 
We start the discussion by remembering that the paramagnetie center is 
created, when a defect electron, or hole, becomes trapped at one of the oxygen 
ligands around a substitutional aluminum impurity ion. In a good approximation, 
the paramagnetism of the color center can therefore be attributed to a singly 
negatively charged oxygen ion, 2s22:p 
5, surrounded by an aluminum and a silicon 
metal ligand, both having the configuration 2822p 6. It will turn out that such a 
"localized ion" accounts adequately for most of the experimental data. The 
reason is that metal-oxygen bonds in Si02 are dominantly ionic. 
Thus, the basic structure of the color center in smoky quartz is characterized 
by an O--ion, 2p5, L = 1, S  1/2, which is subject to a Stark effect from the 
non-cubic crystalline fields arising from the aluminum and silicon metal ligand. 
These field gradients split the threefold orbital degeneracy of the 2P-state into 
three orbital singlet states. In order to calculate this splitting, in the spirit of 
crystal field theory, we consider the ligand geometry shown in Fig. 11. The 
paramagnetic O--ion is at the center of the coordinate system, el and e2 represent 
the effective electric charges of the aluminum and silicon ligand, respectively. In 
the limit of an ideally ionic bond, we have el/e2 = 3/4. The ligand geometry shown 
in Fig. 11, with R1 < R2, corresponds to that of a GS center. For a ES center, the 
The Electronic Structure of the Trapped-Hole Center in Smoky Quartz 
33 
roles of R1 and R2 must be interchanged. The hole is then in an oxygen site slightly 
more distant from the aluminum impurity, where it experiences a slightly weaker 
Coulomb attraction. At an undisturbed oxygen site in the SiO2 lattice, where 
el = e2, we have R1/R2 - 0.99 and 2 = 144.0  [8] 
6. 
An expansion of the crystalhne electric ligand potential, active at the oxygen 
site, yields the following expression: 
V (x, y, z) = elR1 -4- e2/ R 
-- (e2/R 2 -- el/R 2) sin v

 (1/4)(el/R + e2/R)" (3z 
2 -- r2). 
Note, that the term linear in x and the mixed term xy are practically zero at 
an undisturbed oxygen site in the Si02 lattice, where el = e2. There, the local 
symmetry at the oxygen site is C2v, to a very good approximation, whereas it is 
lowered to Cs if one of the two silicon ligands is substituted by an aluminum 
impurity ion. This will no longer be true if the, admittedly much weaker, con- 
tributions to V (x, y, z) arising from more distant oxygen and silicon ligands are 
taken into account. In this case, the local symmetry at an oxygen site is only C1, 
already in the undisturbed Si02 lattice. 
The threefold orbital degeneracy of the 2P-state of the O--ion will be lifted by 
the bilinear terms in the crystal potential expansion, as given by Eq. (1). The 
resulting 3 X 3 energy matrix is most conveniently diagonalized by transformation 
to a new coordinate system, $, , $ in which the mixed term xy of the field gradient 
vanishes. This can be achieved by rotating the coordinate system x, y, z around 
the z-axis by the "tilting" angle  which is determined by the relation 
e2/ 
R] -- el/ R 
tg 2 7: = e2/ R] -}- el/ R " tg 2 v 
 . 
(2) 
In the new coordinate system, the field gradients are written as 
V(, /, ) -- -- b20(3 2 -- 2) + b22(2 __ V2), 
(3a) 
where 
b20 = + (1/4)(el/Ral + e2/Ra2), 
cos 2  
(3 b) 
b22 =

" 
Now, the energy matrix is diagonal for the three basis functions 2p, 2p, and 2pg. 
The eigenvalues are 
E -- -]- 2flb2o, 
E, = -- fl(b20 -- b22), 
E = -- fi(b20 - b22). 
(4) 
6 There are two recent determinations of the Si-O bond distances in -quartz [8]. Following 
Smith and Alexander [8a] we have /1 = 1.597 4- 0.003 l, _R2 = 1.617 4- 0.003/, giving 
R1/R2  0.988 4- 0.004. On the other hand, Young and Post [8b] obtain R1 = 1.603 4- 0.003 -, 
R2 = 1.611 4- 0.002/,, leading to .R1/R2 = 0.995 4- 0.004. These values were determined at 
room temperature. Smith [8 c] has shown that the tetrahedra in r 
cannot be regular, 
but he cannot exclude by his analysis the possibility of equal Si-O bond distances. Never- 
theless, he believes that the measured differences in the Si-O bond distances are real.

(5) 
For the ligand geometry representative both for a GS and ES center, it is 
readily seen that E lies lowest and that E$  E v  E. Consequently, since we 
have to accomodate five 2p-electrons in the level scheme, the unpaired spin will 
be in the state E. Its wavefunction, 2p, lies therefore normal to the plane of the 
triangle aluminum-oxygen-silicon. 
In our discussion, we had sofar neglected the terms linear in x and y occuring 
in the crystal potential expansion, as given by Eq. (1). These terms will admix 
states of opposite parity, dominantly 2s-states, to the 2p-states of the O--iota 
This way the O--ion becomes 2s2p-hybridized. We want to discuss this con- 
figurational interaction in the Cv-approximation, where the differences in the 
electric charges of the two metal ligands are neglected. In this case, the term linear 
in x in the crystal potential expansion, Eq. (1), vanishes and only the 2py-state 
will acquire some 2s-character. Now, the oxygen eigenfunctions hybridized 
according to C2v-symmctry are

In the C2v-approximation, where we assume that el ----

B = e (e2/R) (1 + 3 cos 2 v 
) (115) (r2}2p 
Ao = E2 -- E2s 9 
An order of magnitude estimate of this parameter can be readily obtained. For 
this, we take e2 = 4e, R2 = 1.61 A, 28 = 144 
 and E2p- E2s = 15.0 eV or 
121000 cm-1. The latter value was obtained by an extrapolation from isoelectronic 
2p5 ions, taldng E2p -- E2s equal to the energetical difference of the configurations 
2s12p6 and 2s2p 5. The matrix elements (2slYi2pu} 
and (r2}2p have been 
calculated for the case of Slater-type radial wavefunctions of the O--ion [16] as 
(2s]y]2py} = 0.687 a.u. and (r2}2p = 1.70 a.u. With these values we then 
obtain :r = 0.296. Thus, the 2s-admixture to the 2py-state of the O--ion appears 
to be almost negligibly small since cr 
2 = 0.088. 
In the C2v-approximation, which is representative for an undisturbed oxygen 
ion in the Si02 lattice, the 2 Px and 2 Pz functions remain non-hybridized. However, 
at an oxygen ion nearest to an aluminum impurity, the local symmetry is approxi- 
mately Cs, and 2 s-admixture to the 2 px-state must also be considered. Admittedly, 
The Electronic Structure of the Trapped-Hole Center in Smoky Quartz 
35 
these contributions will be much smMler, since they depend only on the difference 
el -- e2 of the effective charges of the two metal ligands, see Eq. (1). 
Because of the 2s-admixture to the 2py and 2px-orbitals of the O--ion in the 
color center, electric dipole transitions from the 2p2p2p ground state to both 
2 
1 
2 
excited states, 2plx2p2p2z and 2px2py2pz , become allowed. In an individual color 
center, these transitions will be polarized parallel to the axis of the non-hybridized 
2pz-orbital, in which the unpaired spin is accomodated. A discussion of the optical 
absorption spectrum of smoky quartz will be given in Section 4.3. 
If some covalent bonding of the oxygen ion with its two metal ligands is ad- 
mitted, the states A(11), B2 and A(12) 
turn out to be engaged in lower lying bonding 
molecular orbital states, with A(12) being almost non-bonding, whereas the 2pz- 
state B1 forms a truly non-bonding state. 
However, the -- dominantly isotropic -- hyperfine interaction of the unpaired 
spin with the adjacent A12 
and Si 
29 ligand nuclei turns out to be so small that only 
a fractional part of the unpaired spins wavefunction can be localized at the metal 
ligands. This is seen by the following argument : For an unpaired spin fully localized 
at a metal ligand, e.g. in the 3s-orbital of A12+ or Si 
3+, the isotropic part of the 
hyperfine interaction would amount to 1420 gauss and 1820 gauss, respectively7. 
Experimentally [2, 10], the corresponding mean values are 5 ... 6 gauss for A127 
and about 11 gauss for Si 
29. Thus, also on the basis of the ligand hyperfine structure 
data, the assumption of a dominantly ionic model for the color center in smoky 
quartz appears to be justified, at least for its 2p2p2p ground state. 
Further direct evidence for the pronounced localisation of the unpaired spin 
at the oxygen site would be available ff the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear 
spin, I = 5/2, of the 017 isotope had been observed. Attempts to detect these weak 
hyperfine structure satellites in the ESR-spectrum remained unsuccessful, because 
of the very low natural abundance of the 017 isotope, 0.037 %. A further discussion 
of the A127 and Si 
29 ligand hyperfine structure data is not straightforward and will 
not be attempted in this paper. 
4.2 g- Tensor 
The deviations of the g-tensor components g from the free-spin value of 2.0023 
result from the spin-orbit interaction which admixes excited states to the ground 
state wavefunction. For the case of the 2P-state of the O--ion, split by the crystal 
field potential V($, 7, ), as described by Eq. (3), the first-order g-shifts are given 
by the simple relations 
Ag 
= 
0 
At,, = -- 2 /(E -- Ec) 
(S) 
Ag = -- 2 /(E, -- Ec). 
The energy denominators are defined by Eqs. (4), and  is the spin-orbit coupling 
constant of the O--ion. Note, that also the g-tensor is diagonal in the tilted coor- 
dinate system , 7, .

R. Schnadt and J. Schneider: 
Comparison is invited with the experimental g-shift data, as compiled in 
Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. For this, we have first to express the Agi, m the micro- 
scopic coordinate system x, y, z, as defined in Fig. 11. It then turns out that the 
axis of the smallest g-value, g3, must be taken approximately along the z-axis. 
This is to be expected on the basis of the ligand field scheme shown in Fig. 11. 
There is still a small tilting of the g3-axis from the z-axis, about 2  for the GS center 
and 3  for the ES center. This can be explained by the fact that because of the 
influence of the more distant ligands the true symmetry of the center is only C1. 
We then have for a GS center 
Aga = Agr162 
= 0.0001 
Ag2 = Agn = 0.0068 
Agl = Ag = 0.0591, 
with (GS) = -- (7.8 • 0.5)  and similarly, for a ES center 
Ag3 = zJgr162 
= 0.0003 
Ag2 = zJg = 0.0068 
Agl = Ag = 0.0545, 
with T(ES) = (9.8 4- 0.5)  The mean error in the Ag is 4- 0.0003. 
From Eqs. (2), (3) and (4) we can establish the following simple relation for the 
g-shifts 
Agi 
E -- Er _ $g (0 -- 7). fg (0 -- z). 
(9) 
Ag, -- En-- Er 
In this equation, we can insert the experimental values for the g-shifts and for the 
tilting angle z and solve for the angle aluminum-oxygen-silicon, 20. For a GS 
center, we then obtain 20 = 139.8 4- 1.1  and for a ES center 20 = 137.1  1.2  
We remember that at an undisturbed oxygen site in the Si02 lattice the angle 
silicon-oxygen-silicon amounts to 20 ---- 
144  [8]. 
From the above g-shift data, an estimate of the energy differences Er -- E n 
and Er -- E can be obtained, on the basis of Eqs. (8). For the spin-orbit coupling 
constant of the 0--ion we take A = -- 132 cm -1 s, and obtain for a GS center 
Er 
n= 
4470cm -1 
Er -- E = 38 800 cm 
-1 
and similarly, for a ES center 
Er 
v= 
4840cm-1 
Er -- E = 38 800 cm 
-1 . 
We want to attempt an ab initio numerical estimate of the above energy differences, 
on the basis of Eqs. (3), (4) and (5). For this, we take el = 3e, eg. = 4e, R1 = R2 
= 1.61 A, and for 20 the mean values representative for the aluminum color 
center, as determined above, 20 = 138.5  4- 2.0  The matrix element <r2>2p has 
been calculated with Slater4ype radial wavefuncfions of the 0--ion [16], which 
8 This value was obtained by an extrapolation from isoelectronic 2p 
5 atoms and ions, 
taking 2 equal to two-thirds the difference between the 2O3[ 
2 and 2P1[2 state. 
The Electronic Structure of the Trapped-Hole Center in Smoky Quartz 
37 
were already used above in the calculation of the mixing parameter , as given 
by Eq. (7)9. The result is (r2>2p ---- 1.70 a.u., and we then obtain for the energy 
differences 
E -- E n = ( 6 800 :[: 1300) cm 
-1 , 
E -- E = (48600 : 1300) cm -1 . 
The relative uncertainty in E -- E v is rather great, because this energy results 
from a difference of two energy terms which have comparable magnitude, see Eqs. 
(3b) and (4). The energy Er -- E can be scaled down to the value predicted by 
the experimental g-shift data, as determined above, by assuming that the effective 
charges of the two metal ligands are reduced to 80 per cent of their ideally ionic 
values. However, the accuracy of such ab initio crystal field calculations should not 
be overestimated. 
Within the crystal field approximation, we can establish a relation which cor- 
relates the tilting angle of the GS center to that of the ES center, 
tg2T(GS) 
[ 
ele2 
q-- tg2(ES) -- -- \1--128z- 
2 , 
(10) 
e 2 -- 
e 1 ] 
where 8 is defined by R2 ---- 
R1 (1 -$- 8). The above relation holds in the limit of small 
values of 8. It predicts tbaS She GS and ES centers are tilted in an opposite sense, 
and that the tilting of the ES center is slightly greater. Taking el ---- 
3e, e2-- 
4e and 
for 8 the value resulting from the crystallographic analysis reported by Smith and 
Alexander [8a], 8=0.013• 
Eq. (10) predicts q=--(0.73=]=0.08). On the 
other hand, taking 8 from the analysis of Young and Post [8b], 8 = 0.005 J= 0.004, 
we arrive at q = -- (0.90 • 0.08). 
Experimentally, we had 
found 
"c(GS) 
-- -- (7.8  q- 0.5  and v(ES) = -F (9-8 
 :k 0.5 
giving q -- -- (0.78 q- 0.05). 
We finally come to an estimate of the energy difference zJE between the ground 
state of the GS center and the ground state of the ES center, which on the basis of 
Eq. (1) amounts to 
AE = e(e2 -- el) (1/R1 -- 1/R2). 
(11) 
The experimental value was dE ---- 
(30 • 6) meV, or 240 em 
-1. Because of the 
uncertainty of the measured Si-O bond distances, only an order of magnitude 
estimate of AE can be attempted: Taking el -- 3e and e2  4e, and for the bond 
lenghts the values of Smith and Alexander [8 a], we obtain AE ---- (110 :k 30) meV, 
whereas the values of Young and Post [8b] yield AE ---- (45 q- 30) meV. However, 
a further uncertainty arises because of the inevitable lattice distortion around the 
aluminum impurity ion. In addition, iS should also be considered that these 
crystallographic data were obtained at room temperature. 
9 From restricted Hartree-Fock radial wavefunctions of 0-, as compiled by Clementi [17], 
a much greater value of <r>2p is obtained, <r2>2p = 3.03 a.u. The reason is that the Hartree- 
Fock 2p-function of the O--ion have a considerably greater radial extension, as compared to 
the corresponding Slater function. However, in an ionic solid, we have to demand a cut-off of 
the wavefunction at a radial distance corresponding to the radius of the ion in question. 
Therefore, we believe that Slater-type radial wavefunctions yield more realistic values for 
matrix elements of the type <r2>.

4.3 Optical Absorption Spectra 
Within the framework of the crystal field approximation of the aluminum color 
center, as outlined in Section 4.1, two transitions should be expected to occur in 
the optical absorption spectrum of smoky quartz. These correspond to the excita- 
tion of an electron from the filled 2py or 2p-state to the 2pz-state of the O--ion. 
The transitions will exhibit electric dipole character, because the color center lacks 
inversion symmetry, dominantly with respect to the y-axis, but also to a lesser 
extent with respect to the x-axis, see Fig. 11. 
An estimate of the energies of these excitations was obtained in the preceeding 
Section, on the basis of an evaluation of the optical absorption bands, one occuring 
in the near infrared region, approximately at 4500 cm 
-i, the other in the ultra- 
violet region, at 39 000 cm 
-1. Similar energies were predicted on the basis of the 
crystal field calculations outlined in Section 4.2. 
Disappointingly enough, "smoky" quartz has deserved its name because of the 
very fact that it absorbes light in the visible part of the optical spectrum, see 
Fig. 10. The absorption is seen to set in at about 11000 cm 
-i, then strongly in- 
creasing towards shorter wavelengths. 
Strong optical absorption is still present at 39000 cm 
-1 where the 2p2p2plz 
1

2 
--> 2px2pu2pz transition is expected to occur. This part of the spectrum is not 
shown in Fig. 10. However, no pronounced absorption peak can be recognized at

this photon energy. On the other hand, a search for the 2pz2py2pz->2px2pu2pz 
transition of the color center, which is expected to occur iu the near infrared region, 
was inconclusive because of the strong vibrational bands occuring in this spectral 
region [18]. 
We must therefore admit that the coloration of smoky quartz in the visible part 
of the optical spectrum cannot be explained within the framework of our crystal 
field approximation, notwithstanding the fact that several authors have reported 
a correlation between the aluminum content in quartz and the absorption in the 
visible [2, 11, 15]. 
There may still be the possibility that "charge-transfer" transitions account 
for the coloration of smoky quartz in the visible part of the spectrum. These 
transitions would correspond to an electron transfer from the second nearest 
oxygen ligands, around the aluminum impurity ion, to fill the 2pz 
1 state of the 
nearest oxygen ligand. 
d.4 Motional E]/ects 
We had seen that around a given aluminum impurity in the Si02-1attice, the 
trapped hole has the choice between two equivalent GS or ES oxygen sites. At 
temperatures below 77  
the two ES sites are practically no longer thermally 
populated. If localized at one given GS oxygen site, the hole should still have the 
freedom to spend some time at the neighboring GS oxygen site. 
At the first glance, the two GS sites are energetically equivalent. The wave- 
function of the unpaired hole should then be constructed as a linear superposition 
of the two 2pz-orbitals, to be labeled in the following as Zi and 9/2, 
v- 
= (l/V2) (xi -4- g2). 
(12) 
The Electronic Structure of the Trapped-Hole Center in Smoky Quartz 
39 
The situation is quite analogous to that encountered for the H + molecular ion 
or for the amonia molecule. Because oi the inevitable exchange of the hole between 
the two oxygen sites, the twofold site degeneracy of the 2pz ground state will be 
split, according to 
E: = :J= V, 
(13) 
where ? is the exchange integral. 
This splitting can be estimated to be rather small, of the order of a few cm 
-1, 
because of the small overlap of the 2 pz-orbitals centered at the two oxygen sites in 
question 10. 
However, a drastic reduction of this exchange splitting, 27, is expected to 
occur if we consider effects resulting from the polarization of the lattice. If thought 
to be localized at either one of the two equivalent oxygen sites, the defect charge 
of the hole will polarize its lattice environment. During the "tunneling" process to 
the adjacent oxygen site, this lattice polarization will follow the tunneling hole, 
since the exchange interaction 2 ?, as estimated above, is much smaller than the 
mean energy representative for the lattice vibrations in quartz. Therefore, we 
expect that the effective mass of the tunneling hole is strongly increased, because 
of its accompanying "phonon cloud". 
The situation is seen to be quite analogous to that encountered for narrow-band 
semiconductors, where such "polaronic" effects are rather prominent [19]. Con- 
sequently the effective exchange splitting, to be labeled 27", will be strongly 
reduced. De Vos [20] has determined this quantity by means of dielectric relaxation 
measurements at low temperatures. Typical values as low as 2?*  5 • 10 
-4 meV, 
corresponding to 4X 10 
-3 cm 
-1, were observed. Now, the effective exchange 
splitting 2?* turns out to be so small, that the effects resulting from random 
electric fields, F, which arise from imperfections and crystalline strains present in 
the piezoelectric host, can no longer be neglected. These random electric fields will 
be strong enough to enforce an almost complete loealisaion of the spin at either 
one of the two GS oxygen sites adjacent to r 
aluminum impurity ion. 
This can be seen from the following considerations: In the presence of an 
electric field F, there will be a further Stark-splitting of the two exchange-split 
states of our "two-well" system. Eq. (13) should now be generalized to read 
E•177 
?V-('F)

(14) 
Here, bt is the permanent electric dipole moment of the site-degenerate center, in 
the limit of strong localisation. 
It will be directed along the internuclear axis connecting the two GS oxygen 
sites, and its absolute value should be of the order of 
I[I = (1/2). edo-o  6.2 Debye, 
where d0-0  2.6/l is the internuclear spacing of two oxygen sites [8] 11. Again 
the situation resembles that encountered for the Stark effect of the ammonia 
molecule. 
10 According to O'Brien [1], 27 = 4.6 cm 
-1. 
11 Experimentally de Vos [20] quotes 1[] = (8.5  1.5) Debye, without applying an 
internal field correction.

R. Schnadt and J. Schneider: 
The essential point to note, is that in the presence of a sufficiently strong electric 
field, i. e. for ] $a 9 
F] > y*, the hole will be enforced to be almost entirely localized 
at one of the two GS oxygen sites. This localisation can be estimated from the 
wavefunctions of the two-level system which, in the high-field limit, develop as 
follows

That part of the random electric fields F which arises from charge-deficient 
impurity ions and lattice defects will be of the order of 
Z.e (43

N<,) 
, 
(16) 
where Z 9 
e is the effective charge of the defect, and s  4.5 is the mean dielectric 
constant of the Si02 host. For a typical defect concentration of Nd = 10 
is cm 
-8 
in SiO2, we deal already with random internal fields of the order of 
IF[ Z" 80000 V/cm 
and, consequently, 2. (in. F) = I 
I F I 
z. s era-1 >> 2 v*. The magnitude 
of this defect-induced Stark-splitting falls within the range of experimental data, 
which have been obtained by de Vos [20] on samples with typical defect con- 
centrations of 10 
is cm-a. From his dielectric loss measurements on smoky quartz, 
values ranging between 1.5 and 6 em 
-1 were observed for this random Stark- 
splitting 2 9 
(ta 9 
F) in typical samples. That part of the random internal fields 
which arises from piezoelectric strains in the Si02-1attice cannot so easily be 
estimated. 
In either case, we can safely assume that the random electric fields are strong 
enough to enforce almost complete localisation of the hole at one of the two 
equivalent GS oxygen sites. 
On the other hand, one should reahze that the magnitude of this random 
Stark-splitting is very small with respect to the crystal field differences Er 
Ee 
and Er -- Ev, as introduced in Eq. (4). It can be estimated that these random 
fields may contribute to some extent to the inhomogeneous width of an individual 
ESl-hne, which is about 0.2 gauss at sufficiently low temperatures. It should also 
be noted that the random Stark-splitting is still considerably smaller than the 
energy difference AE = 30 meV between a GS and a ES oxygen site. 
A schematic energy diagram of the GS two-well system which illustrates the 
various interactions discussed above is shown in Fig. 12. 
We are now ready to give a comment on the experiment of Taylor and Farnell 
[14], which demonstrates rather convincingly the thermal overflow of the spin to 
the adjacent GS oxygen site, under the influence of an external perturbation. As 
already mentioned in Section 3.1.3, Taylor and Farnell applied a static electric 
field to a smoky quartz sample, while the crystal was in the ES1%speetrometer, 
and observed changes in the thermal population of adjacent GS oxygen sites. 
If an external electric field, Fext, is applied to the crystal, the thermal popula- 
tion of the two GS oxygen sites, n and n*, will be changed, according to 
n*ln = exp{-- 2Vy*2 q- [(F q- Fext)" br 
]cT} 
exp{-- 2 y.. (F + Fext)/kT}.

Fig. 12. Interactions between the two GS centers, belonging to the same aluminum impurity. 
A Neglecting exchange there is a twofold site degeneracy for the unpaired hole, because 
of the two equivalent GS oxygen sites around a given aluminum. 
B This site degeneracy is removed by exchange, resulting in a splitting of about 5 cm 
-1 [1]. 
C The exchange splitting is strongly reduced by polaronic effects, which are specific for 
the lattice. De Vos [20] determined experimentally a splitting of about 5 • 10 
-4 cm 
-1. 
D By the combined action of strain and of defect induced electric fields the double well 
becomes asymmetric, resulting in a strongly 
enhancedsplitting and in a localisationof the hole 
in one well. These effects depend on lattice perfection and on the concentration and the kind of 
the defects. 
E The application of a magnetic field lifts the twofold spin degeneracy. Because of the 
anisotropic g-tensor the Zeeman-splitting depends slightly on 
the orientation of 
the magnetic field 
Here, local field corrections, as the Lorentz factor, are already included in Fext. 
At very low temperatures, the Mgher lying GS oxygen site is thermally 
frozen out, and the external field Fext can enforce no change in population, as long 
as - F >>  9 
Fext. In the high temperature limit, however, the system responds 
to the external electric field Fext as if no strain-induced fields F were present. 
In Section 3.1.3, we had already mentioned that the thermally activated 
hopping of the spin among the two GS sites results in a strong broadening of the 
ESR-hnes, at temperatures above 120 
Above 170 
the ESR-spectrum has 
disappeared entirely. Attempts to discover a motionally averaged ESR-spectrum, 
at temperatures up to 520  
remained unsuccessful. Obviously, there is a high 
probability tha the spin loses its phase memory during the hopping process. 
Such effects are not expected to occur for the analogous aluminum colour 
center in amorphous quartz, i.e. in silica glass. Here, the twofold site degeneracy 
of a GS or ES center is absent because of the irregular arrangement of the oxygen 
ligands. Consequently, around a given aluminum impurity, the defect electron 
will be permanently localized at only one of the four oxygen ligands -- and 
motional effects should practically not occur. 
On the basis of these considerations, it was therefore not surprising that ESR 
of the aluminum color center in silica glass could be detected already at 300 
42 R. Schnadt et al. : The Electronic Structure of the Trapped-Hole Center in Smoky Quartz 
and above. The ESR-spectrum observed is admittedly rather unspecific, but it 
still reveals an indication of the A127 
hypcrfine structure. At 9GHz, the total spread 
of the glass spectrum is about 45 gauss. Considering a total A127 hyperfine splitting 
of about 30 gauss, the spectrum extends from g ---- 
2.002 to g ----- 
2.009. 
The suppression of motional effects for the aluminum color center in silica 
glass is also demonstrated by the fact, that certain dielectric loss relaxation bands, 
which are characteristic for X-irradiated crystalline quartz, do not show up in 
silica glass [20, 22].
