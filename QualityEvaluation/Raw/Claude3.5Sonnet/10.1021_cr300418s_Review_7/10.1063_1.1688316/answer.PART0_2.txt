[1] "The formation and migration of oxygen vacancies in ceria is closely related to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria in TWC, as mentioned in the Introduction."

[2] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En=E(CeO2-n) + 1/2 E(O2) - E(CeO2), where E(CeO2-n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[4] "Our surface En values in Table II are all lower than our bulk value. This is in agreement with earlier empirical interaction model calculations, which suggested that a vacancy defect is more stable at the surface than within the bulk."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a crucial aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is referred to as En in this text. It is calculated as the difference in energy between the oxide with and without an oxygen vacancy, plus half the energy of an oxygen molecule. A lower En value indicates that it is easier to create an oxygen vacancy.

The significance of ΔEv (or En) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability can be inferred from the following points:

1. It is directly related to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, which is important for its catalytic applications.

2. The formation energy is lower at the surface than in the bulk, suggesting that surface vacancies are more readily formed. This would likely lead to higher catalytic activity at the surface.

3. The preferred location of oxygen vacancies depends on the surface structure, with different surfaces (e.g., (111) vs (110)) having different preferred vacancy locations. This implies that different crystal facets may have varying catalytic activities.

4. Lower formation energies generally indicate easier vacancy formation, which would likely correlate with higher catalytic activity and potentially stronger oxidizing ability of the surface.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or catalytic oxidation reactions, the information about oxygen vacancy formation energies provides insight into the potential catalytic behavior of ceria surfaces.

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个关键方面。

文本中将氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）称为En。它被计算为有和没有氧空位的氧化物之间的能量差，加上氧分子能量的一半。较低的En值表示更容易形成氧空位。

ΔEv（或En）在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性可以从以下几点推断：

1. 它与氧化铈的储氧能力直接相关，这对其催化应用很重要。

2. 表面的形成能比体相低，表明表面空位更容易形成。这可能会导致表面有更高的催化活性。

3. 氧空位的优先位置取决于表面结构，不同的表面（如(111)和(110)）有不同的优先空位位置。这意味着不同的晶面可能具有不同的催化活性。

4. 较低的形成能通常表示更容易形成空位，这可能与更高的催化活性和潜在的更强的表面氧化能力相关。

虽然文本没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或催化氧化反应，但关于氧空位形成能的信息为理解氧化铈表面的潜在催化行为提供了洞见。
