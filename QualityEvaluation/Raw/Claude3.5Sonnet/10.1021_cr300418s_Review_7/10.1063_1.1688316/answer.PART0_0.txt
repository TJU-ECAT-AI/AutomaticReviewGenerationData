[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by
En=ECeO2n!1 1
2 EO2!2ECeO2!,"

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[4] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is closely related to the concepts presented.

The formation energy (En) of an oxygen vacancy is a key factor in determining the ease of creating vacancies on oxide surfaces. A lower En value indicates that less energy is needed to create a vacancy, which can potentially lead to higher catalytic activity. The literature shows that the formation energy varies depending on the surface structure and orientation of the oxide.

For CeO2, the (110) surface has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to the (111) surface, suggesting that it may be more catalytically active. The creation of oxygen vacancies modifies the electronic structure of the surface, partially occupying the Ce 4f states. This change in electronic structure is expected to alter the conductivity and chemical properties of the oxide surface.

While the literature does not directly address the oxidizing ability of the surface, the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the resulting changes in electronic structure are likely to influence the oxide's ability to participate in oxidation reactions. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies may be more prone to releasing oxygen for oxidation reactions, but may also be less stable under oxidizing conditions.

In summary, although the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned, the oxygen vacancy formation energy plays a crucial role in determining the potential catalytic activity of oxide surfaces by influencing the ease of oxygen release and the electronic structure of the surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在给定的文献中没有被明确讨论。然而，形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）与文中提出的概念密切相关。

氧空位的形成能（En）是决定氧化物表面上形成空位难易程度的关键因素。较低的En值表明形成空位所需的能量较少，这可能导致更高的催化活性。文献表明，形成能因氧化物表面的结构和方向而异。

对于CeO2，(110)表面的氧空位形成能比(111)表面低，这表明它可能具有更高的催化活性。氧空位的形成改变了表面的电子结构，部分占据了Ce 4f态。这种电子结构的变化预计会改变氧化物表面的导电性和化学性质。

虽然文献没有直接讨论表面的氧化能力，但氧空位形成的容易程度和由此导致的电子结构变化很可能会影响氧化物参与氧化反应的能力。具有较低空位形成能的表面可能更容易释放氧以进行氧化反应，但在氧化条件下可能也不太稳定。

总之，尽管没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面潜在催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用，因为它影响了氧释放的难易程度和表面的电子结构。
