          [1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En=ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively."

[4] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

[5] "For the reduced surfaces, the Ce 4f states are partially occupied. The conductivity and chemical properties are expected to be modified by the creation of O vacancies."

[6] "These defective surfaces with significant changes in surface structure are expected to be more active towards foreign incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces."

[7] "Our surface En values in Table II are all lower than our bulk value. This is in agreement with earlier empirical interaction model calculations, which suggested that a vacancy defect is more stable at the surface than within the bulk."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv), referred to as En in the text, is crucial for understanding this mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The formation energy (En) of an oxygen vacancy is a key factor in determining the ease of creating vacancies on oxide surfaces. A lower En value indicates that less energy is needed to create a vacancy, which can potentially lead to higher catalytic activity. The literature shows that the formation energy varies depending on the surface structure and orientation of the oxide.

For CeO2, the (110) surface has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to the (111) surface, suggesting that it may be more catalytically active. The creation of oxygen vacancies modifies the electronic structure of the surface, partially occupying the Ce 4f states. This change in electronic structure is expected to alter the conductivity and chemical properties of the oxide surface.

The study found that oxygen vacancy formation is easier on the surface than in the bulk, indicating that surface vacancies are more readily formed. This would likely lead to higher catalytic activity at the surface. The defective surfaces with oxygen vacancies are expected to be more active towards incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces.

The significance of ΔEv (or En) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability can be inferred from these points:
1. It is directly related to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, which is important for its catalytic applications.
2. Lower formation energies generally indicate easier vacancy formation, which would likely correlate with higher catalytic activity and potentially stronger oxidizing ability of the surface.
3. The preferred location of oxygen vacancies depends on the surface structure, implying that different crystal facets may have varying catalytic activities.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly mentioned, the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the resulting increased surface reactivity are consistent with this mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction and is then replenished from the gas phase.

          虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本中提到的氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv，在文中称为En）对理解氧化物催化的氧化反应中的这种机制至关重要。

氧空位的形成能（En）是决定氧化物表面上形成空位难易程度的关键因素。较低的En值表明形成空位所需的能量较少，这可能导致更高的催化活性。文献表明，形成能因氧化物表面的结构和方向而异。

对于CeO2，(110)表面的氧空位形成能比(111)表面低，这表明它可能具有更高的催化活性。氧空位的形成改变了表面的电子结构，部分占据了Ce 4f态。这种电子结构的变化预计会改变氧化物表面的导电性和化学性质。

研究发现，在表面形成氧空位比在体相中更容易，表明表面空位更容易形成。这可能会导致表面有更高的催化活性。具有氧空位的缺陷表面预计对入射原子和分子的活性比干净完美的表面更高。

ΔEv（或En）在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性可以从以下几点推断：
1. 它与氧化铈的储氧能力直接相关，这对其催化应用很重要。
2. 较低的形成能通常表示更容易形成空位，这可能与更高的催化活性和潜在的更强的表面氧化能力相关。
3. 氧空位的优先位置取决于表面结构，这意味着不同的晶面可能具有不同的催化活性。

虽然没有直接提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但氧空位形成的容易程度和由此产生的表面反应性增加与该机制是一致的。在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，晶格氧参与氧化反应，然后从气相中补充。
