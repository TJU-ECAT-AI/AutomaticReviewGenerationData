[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by

2 EO2!2ECeO2!,"

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively."

[4] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

[5] "For the reduced surfaces, the Ce 4f states are partially occupied. The conductivity and chemical properties are expected to be modified by the creation of O vacancies."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is closely related to the concepts presented.

The formation energy (En) of an oxygen vacancy is a key factor in determining the ease of creating vacancies on oxide surfaces. A lower En value indicates that less energy is needed to create a vacancy, which can potentially lead to higher catalytic activity. The literature shows that the formation energy varies depending on the surface structure and orientation of the oxide.

For CeO2, the (110) surface has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to the (111) surface, suggesting that it may be more catalytically active. The creation of oxygen vacancies modifies the electronic structure of the surface, partially occupying the Ce 4f states. This change in electronic structure is expected to alter the conductivity and chemical properties of the oxide surface.

While the literature does not directly address the oxidizing ability of the surface, the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the resulting changes in electronic structure are likely to influence the oxide's ability to participate in oxidation reactions. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies may be more prone to releasing oxygen for oxidation reactions, but may also be less stable under oxidizing conditions.

In summary, although the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned, the oxygen vacancy formation energy plays a crucial role in determining the potential catalytic activity of oxide surfaces by influencing the ease of oxygen release and the electronic structure of the surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在给定的文献中没有被明确讨论。然而，形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）与文中提出的概念密切相关。

氧空位的形成能（En）是决定氧化物表面上形成空位难易程度的关键因素。较低的En值表明形成空位所需的能量较少，这可能导致更高的催化活性。文献表明，形成能因氧化物表面的结构和方向而异。

对于CeO2，(110)表面的氧空位形成能比(111)表面低，这表明它可能具有更高的催化活性。氧空位的形成改变了表面的电子结构，部分占据了Ce 4f态。这种电子结构的变化预计会改变氧化物表面的导电性和化学性质。

虽然文献没有直接讨论表面的氧化能力，但氧空位形成的容易程度和由此导致的电子结构变化很可能会影响氧化物参与氧化反应的能力。具有较低空位形成能的表面可能更容易释放氧以进行氧化反应，但在氧化条件下可能也不太稳定。

总之，尽管没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面潜在催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用，因为它影响了氧释放的难易程度和表面的电子结构。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in cerium oxide surfaces, which is crucial for understanding catalytic oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature describes this as En, the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy. A lower En value indicates that it is easier to create a vacancy, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity.

The study found that oxygen vacancy formation is easier on the CeO2(110) surface compared to the CeO2(111) surface, suggesting that the (110) surface may be more catalytically active. Furthermore, the formation of oxygen vacancies leads to significant changes in surface structure, making these defective surfaces more active towards incoming atoms and molecules.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly mentioned, the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the resulting increased surface reactivity are consistent with this mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction and is then replenished from the gas phase.

文献中并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文本提供了有关氧化铈表面氧空位形成的相关信息，这对理解催化氧化反应至关重要。

氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。文献将其描述为En，即氧空位的形成能。较低的En值表示更容易形成空位，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。

研究发现，在CeO2(110)表面形成氧空位比在CeO2(111)表面更容易，这表明(110)表面可能具有更高的催化活性。此外，氧空位的形成导致表面结构发生显著变化，使这些缺陷表面对入射原子和分子更加活跃。

虽然没有直接提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但氧空位形成的容易程度和由此产生的表面反应性增加与该机制是一致的。在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，晶格氧参与氧化反应，然后从气相中补充。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a crucial aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is referred to as En in this text. It is calculated as the difference in energy between the oxide with and without an oxygen vacancy, plus half the energy of an oxygen molecule. A lower En value indicates that it is easier to create an oxygen vacancy.

The significance of ΔEv (or En) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability can be inferred from the following points:

1. It is directly related to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, which is important for its catalytic applications.

2. The formation energy is lower at the surface than in the bulk, suggesting that surface vacancies are more readily formed. This would likely lead to higher catalytic activity at the surface.

3. The preferred location of oxygen vacancies depends on the surface structure, with different surfaces (e.g., (111) vs (110)) having different preferred vacancy locations. This implies that different crystal facets may have varying catalytic activities.

4. Lower formation energies generally indicate easier vacancy formation, which would likely correlate with higher catalytic activity and potentially stronger oxidizing ability of the surface.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or catalytic oxidation reactions, the information about oxygen vacancy formation energies provides insight into the potential catalytic behavior of ceria surfaces.

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个关键方面。

文本中将氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）称为En。它被计算为有和没有氧空位的氧化物之间的能量差，加上氧分子能量的一半。较低的En值表示更容易形成氧空位。

ΔEv（或En）在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性可以从以下几点推断：

1. 它与氧化铈的储氧能力直接相关，这对其催化应用很重要。

2. 表面的形成能比体相低，表明表面空位更容易形成。这可能会导致表面有更高的催化活性。

3. 氧空位的优先位置取决于表面结构，不同的表面（如(111)和(110)）有不同的优先空位位置。这意味着不同的晶面可能具有不同的催化活性。

4. 较低的形成能通常表示更容易形成空位，这可能与更高的催化活性和潜在的更强的表面氧化能力相关。

虽然文本没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或催化氧化反应，但关于氧空位形成能的信息为理解氧化铈表面的潜在催化行为提供了洞见。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly discussed in the given literature. However, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is closely related to this mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The literature discusses the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (En) on CeO2 surfaces. This energy is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower formation energy indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The study shows that the formation energy varies depending on the crystal face and the location of the vacancy. For instance, it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the CeO2(110) surface than on the CeO2(111) surface. This suggests that the (110) surface might be more catalytically active in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The ability to easily form and heal oxygen vacancies is key to the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies can more readily participate in oxidation reactions by providing lattice oxygen to reactants and then replenishing the vacancy with oxygen from the gas phase.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the detailed analysis of oxygen vacancy formation energies provides valuable insights into the potential catalytic behavior of different CeO2 surfaces in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在本文献中并未直接讨论。然而，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与氧化物催化氧化反应中的这种机理密切相关。

文献讨论了CeO2表面上氧空位的形成能（En）。这种能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的形成能表示更容易创建氧空位，这对Mars-van Krevelen机理至关重要。

研究表明，形成能因晶面和空位位置而异。例如，在CeO2(110)表面上创建氧空位比在CeO2(111)表面上更容易。这表明(110)表面在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中可能具有更高的催化活性。

容易形成和修复氧空位的能力是氧化物表面氧化能力的关键。具有较低空位形成能的表面可以更容易地参与氧化反应，通过向反应物提供晶格氧，然后用气相中的氧补充空位。

虽然该文没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但对氧空位形成能的详细分析为不同CeO2表面在氧化反应中的潜在催化行为提供了有价值的见解。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

Lower ΔEv values indicate that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the surface, which is favorable for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The study shows that oxygen vacancies form more easily on the surface than in the bulk of ceria, suggesting higher catalytic activity at the surface.

The formation of oxygen vacancies leads to significant structural changes on the surface, making it more reactive towards incoming atoms and molecules. This increased reactivity is key to the catalytic activity in oxidation reactions.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A lower ΔEv means that lattice oxygen is more readily available for oxidation reactions, enhancing the oxide's ability to oxidize reactants.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism's effectiveness is closely tied to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation. Lower ΔEv values generally indicate higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability of the oxide surface in oxidation reactions.
