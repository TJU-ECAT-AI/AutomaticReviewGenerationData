[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En=ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "Our surface En values in Table II are all lower than our bulk value. This is in agreement with earlier empirical interaction model calculations,10 which suggested that a vacancy defect is more stable at the surface than within the bulk."

[4] "These defective surfaces with significant changes in surface structure are expected to be more active towards foreign incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

Lower ΔEv values indicate that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the surface, which is favorable for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The study shows that oxygen vacancies form more easily on the surface than in the bulk of ceria, suggesting higher catalytic activity at the surface.

The formation of oxygen vacancies leads to significant structural changes on the surface, making it more reactive towards incoming atoms and molecules. This increased reactivity is key to the catalytic activity in oxidation reactions.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A lower ΔEv means that lattice oxygen is more readily available for oxidation reactions, enhancing the oxide's ability to oxidize reactants.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism's effectiveness is closely tied to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation. Lower ΔEv values generally indicate higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability of the oxide surface in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

较低的ΔEv值表明在表面上更容易创造氧空位，这有利于Mars-van Krevelen机制的进行。研究表明，在氧化铈的表面比在体相中更容易形成氧空位，这意味着表面具有更高的催化活性。

氧空位的形成导致表面结构发生显著变化，使其对incoming原子和分子的反应性增强。这种反应性的增加是氧化反应中催化活性的关键。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。较低的ΔEv意味着晶格氧更容易用于氧化反应，增强了氧化物氧化反应物的能力。

总之，Mars-van Krevelen机制的有效性与氧空位形成的难易程度密切相关。在氧化反应中，较低的ΔEv值通常表示氧化物表面具有更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。
