[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En = E(CeO2−n) + 1⁄2 E(O2) − E(CeO2), where E(CeO2−n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

[4] "These defective surfaces with significant changes in surface structure are expected to be more active towards foreign incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in cerium oxide surfaces, which is crucial for understanding catalytic oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature describes this as En, the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy. A lower En value indicates that it is easier to create a vacancy, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity.

The study found that oxygen vacancy formation is easier on the CeO2(110) surface compared to the CeO2(111) surface, suggesting that the (110) surface may be more catalytically active. Furthermore, the formation of oxygen vacancies leads to significant changes in surface structure, making these defective surfaces more active towards incoming atoms and molecules.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly mentioned, the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the resulting increased surface reactivity are consistent with this mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction and is then replenished from the gas phase.

文献中并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文本提供了有关氧化铈表面氧空位形成的相关信息，这对理解催化氧化反应至关重要。

氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。文献将其描述为En，即氧空位的形成能。较低的En值表示更容易形成空位，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。

研究发现，在CeO2(110)表面形成氧空位比在CeO2(111)表面更容易，这表明(110)表面可能具有更高的催化活性。此外，氧空位的形成导致表面结构发生显著变化，使这些缺陷表面对入射原子和分子更加活跃。

虽然没有直接提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但氧空位形成的容易程度和由此产生的表面反应性增加与该机制是一致的。在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，晶格氧参与氧化反应，然后从气相中补充。
