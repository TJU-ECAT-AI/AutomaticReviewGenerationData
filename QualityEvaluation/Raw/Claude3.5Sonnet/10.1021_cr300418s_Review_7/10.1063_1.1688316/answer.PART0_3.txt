[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En = E(CeO2−n) + 1/2E(O2) − E(CeO2), where E(CeO2−n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "For the CeO2(110) p(1×2) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively. By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the (111) and (110) surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly discussed in the given literature. However, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is closely related to this mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The literature discusses the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (En) on CeO2 surfaces. This energy is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower formation energy indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The study shows that the formation energy varies depending on the crystal face and the location of the vacancy. For instance, it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the CeO2(110) surface than on the CeO2(111) surface. This suggests that the (110) surface might be more catalytically active in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The ability to easily form and heal oxygen vacancies is key to the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies can more readily participate in oxidation reactions by providing lattice oxygen to reactants and then replenishing the vacancy with oxygen from the gas phase.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the detailed analysis of oxygen vacancy formation energies provides valuable insights into the potential catalytic behavior of different CeO2 surfaces in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在本文献中并未直接讨论。然而，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与氧化物催化氧化反应中的这种机理密切相关。

文献讨论了CeO2表面上氧空位的形成能（En）。这种能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的形成能表示更容易创建氧空位，这对Mars-van Krevelen机理至关重要。

研究表明，形成能因晶面和空位位置而异。例如，在CeO2(110)表面上创建氧空位比在CeO2(111)表面上更容易。这表明(110)表面在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中可能具有更高的催化活性。

容易形成和修复氧空位的能力是氧化物表面氧化能力的关键。具有较低空位形成能的表面可以更容易地参与氧化反应，通过向反应物提供晶格氧，然后用气相中的氧补充空位。

虽然该文没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但对氧空位形成能的详细分析为不同CeO2表面在氧化反应中的潜在催化行为提供了有价值的见解。
