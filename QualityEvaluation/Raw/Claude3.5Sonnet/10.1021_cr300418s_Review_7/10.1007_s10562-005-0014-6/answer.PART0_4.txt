[1] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[2] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

[3] "We have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[4] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

[5] "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the catalyst surface and subsequent replenishment. Initially, an oxygen atom from the oxide surface reacts with the gas-phase reactant (e.g., CO) to form the product (e.g., CO2). This creates an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The catalytic cycle is completed when gas-phase oxygen fills this vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which generally translates to higher oxidizing power and potentially better catalytic activity. Doping the oxide (e.g., with Au in TiO2) can significantly reduce ΔEv, weakening the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide. This makes the doped oxide a stronger oxidant compared to the pure oxide.

However, it's important to note that an optimal balance is required. If ΔEv is too low, it might lead to rapid removal of surface oxygen, potentially compromising the stability of the catalyst. The ideal catalyst should strike a balance between the ability to donate oxygen atoms during oxidation and the ability to heal oxygen vacancies with gas-phase oxygen.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过催化剂表面氧的移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，氧化物表面的氧原子与气相反应物（如CO）反应形成产物（如CO2）。这在表面上创造了一个氧空位。当气相氧填充这个空位时，催化循环完成，表面恢复到初始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示从表面移除氧更容易，这通常意味着更高的氧化能力和潜在的更好的催化活性。掺杂氧化物（例如在TiO2中掺杂Au）可以显著降低ΔEv，削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键。这使得掺杂的氧化物比纯氧化物具有更强的氧化能力。

然而，需要注意的是，需要一个最佳平衡。如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致表面氧的快速移除，可能会影响催化剂的稳定性。理想的催化剂应在氧化过程中提供氧原子的能力和用气相氧修复氧空位的能力之间取得平衡。
