[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[4] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the oxide surface and subsequent replenishment. Initially, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the gas-phase reactant (e.g., CO), forming the oxidized product (e.g., CO2) and leaving an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, restoring the catalyst to its original state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that surface oxygen is more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant. This is why doping with elements like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni dramatically reduces the bond strength of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, enhancing their oxidation catalysis capabilities.

However, an optimal balance is necessary. If ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or have difficulty replenishing its oxygen. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the oxide won't readily give up its oxygen for oxidation reactions. Therefore, ΔEv serves as a key indicator of an oxide's potential as an oxidation catalyst, with an ideal value allowing for both efficient oxidation and catalyst regeneration.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧化物表面氧的移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧原子与气相反应物（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在表面留下氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，使催化剂恢复到原始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这就是为什么用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等元素掺杂可以显著降低表面氧与二氧化钛或二氧化铈的键强度，从而增强它们的氧化催化能力。

然而，需要一个最佳平衡。如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或难以补充氧。相反，如果ΔEv太高，氧化物就不会轻易释放氧进行氧化反应。因此，ΔEv作为氧化物作为氧化催化剂潜力的关键指标，其理想值应允许高效的氧化和催化剂再生。
