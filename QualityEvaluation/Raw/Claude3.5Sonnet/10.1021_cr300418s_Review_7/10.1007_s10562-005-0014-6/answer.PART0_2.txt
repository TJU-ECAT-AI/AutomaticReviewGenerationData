[1] "We conclude with a note of caution regarding the accuracy of GGA-DFT calculations for oxide chemistry. The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."

[2] "To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[3] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

[4] "We have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[5] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the oxide surface and subsequent replenishment. Initially, the surface oxygen reacts with the molecule to be oxidized (e.g., CO), forming the oxidized product (e.g., CO2) and leaving an oxygen vacancy on the surface. Then, gas-phase oxygen fills this vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state and completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which generally correlates with higher oxidizing ability and potentially better catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may lead to catalyst instability or difficulty in re-oxidizing the surface.

Doping the oxide can significantly reduce ΔEv, weakening the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide. This weakening makes the surface oxygen more reactive, potentially enhancing the catalyst's oxidizing ability. However, an optimal balance must be struck between easy oxygen removal and the ability to heal oxygen vacancies, as this balance is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity and stability.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧化物表面的氧气移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧与待氧化分子（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在表面留下氧空位。然后，气相氧填充这个空位，使表面恢复到初始状态，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示从表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的氧化能力和潜在的更好的催化活性相关。但是，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致催化剂不稳定或表面再氧化困难。

掺杂氧化物可以显著降低ΔEv，削弱表面氧原子与氧化物之间的键合。这种削弱使表面氧更具反应性，可能增强催化剂的氧化能力。然而，必须在容易移除氧和能够修复氧空位之间取得最佳平衡，因为这种平衡对于维持催化活性和稳定性至关重要。
