[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[4] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the oxide surface and subsequent replenishment. Initially, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the gas-phase reactant (e.g., CO), forming the oxidized product (e.g., CO2) and leaving an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, restoring the catalyst to its original state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that surface oxygen is more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant. This is why doping with elements like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, and Ni dramatically reduces the bond strength of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, enhancing their oxidation catalysis capabilities.

However, an optimal balance is necessary. If ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or have difficulty replenishing its oxygen. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the oxide won't readily give up its oxygen for oxidation reactions. Therefore, ΔEv serves as a key indicator of an oxide's potential as an oxidation catalyst, with an ideal value allowing for both efficient oxidation and catalyst regeneration.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧化物表面氧的移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧原子与气相反应物（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在表面留下氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，使催化剂恢复到原始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这就是为什么用Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd和Ni等元素掺杂可以显著降低表面氧与二氧化钛或二氧化铈的键强度，从而增强它们的氧化催化能力。

然而，需要一个最佳平衡。如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或难以补充氧。相反，如果ΔEv太高，氧化物就不会轻易释放氧进行氧化反应。因此，ΔEv作为氧化物作为氧化催化剂潜力的关键指标，其理想值应允许高效的氧化和催化剂再生。

Initially, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the molecule to be oxidized (e.g., CO), forming the oxidized product (e.g., CO2) and leaving behind an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. Then, gas-phase oxygen fills this vacancy, restoring the catalyst to its original state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that surface oxygen is more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant. This enhances its ability to oxidize reactant molecules. However, the ΔEv should not be too low, as this could lead to rapid removal of multiple oxygen atoms, potentially destabilizing the catalyst.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in balancing the catalyst's ability to donate oxygen for oxidation reactions and its capacity to replenish that oxygen from the gas phase. An optimal catalyst strikes a balance between these two processes, ensuring efficient oxidation while maintaining catalyst stability and allowing for the completion of the catalytic cycle.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过催化剂表面氧的移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧原子与待氧化分子（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在催化剂表面留下氧空位。然后，气相氧填补这个空位，使催化剂恢复到原始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这增强了其氧化反应物分子的能力。然而，ΔEv不应过低，因为这可能导致多个氧原子的快速移除，潜在地不稳定催化剂。

ΔEv的重要性在于其在平衡催化剂为氧化反应提供氧的能力和从气相补充氧的能力之间的作用。最佳催化剂在这两个过程之间取得平衡，确保高效氧化的同时保持催化剂稳定性，并允许催化循环的完成。

[1] "We conclude with a note of caution regarding the accuracy of GGA-DFT calculations for oxide chemistry. The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."

[2] "To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

However, if ΔEv is too low, it may lead to catalyst instability or difficulty in re-oxidizing the surface.

Doping the oxide can significantly reduce ΔEv, weakening the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide. This weakening makes the surface oxygen more reactive, potentially enhancing the catalyst's oxidizing ability. However, an optimal balance must be struck between easy oxygen removal and the ability to heal oxygen vacancies, as this balance is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity and stability.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧化物表面的氧气移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧与待氧化分子（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在表面留下氧空位。然后，气相氧填充这个空位，使表面恢复到初始状态，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示从表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的氧化能力和潜在的更好的催化活性相关。但是，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致催化剂不稳定或表面再氧化困难。

掺杂氧化物可以显著降低ΔEv，削弱表面氧原子与氧化物之间的键合。这种削弱使表面氧更具反应性，可能增强催化剂的氧化能力。然而，必须在容易移除氧和能够修复氧空位之间取得最佳平衡，因为这种平衡对于维持催化活性和稳定性至关重要。

Doping the oxide with certain metals (like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni) can significantly reduce ΔEv, enhancing the oxide's oxidizing power and catalytic activity. This effect is due to the weakening of the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide lattice in the presence of the dopant.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the catalyst surface and subsequent replenishment. Initially, an oxygen atom from the oxide surface reacts with the gas-phase reactant (e.g., CO) to form the product (e.g., CO2). This creates an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The catalytic cycle is completed when gas-phase oxygen fills this vacancy, restoring the surface to its initial state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which generally translates to higher oxidizing power and potentially better catalytic activity. Doping the oxide (e.g., with Au in TiO2) can significantly reduce ΔEv, weakening the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide. This makes the doped oxide a stronger oxidant compared to the pure oxide.

However, it's important to note that an optimal balance is required. If ΔEv is too low, it might lead to rapid removal of surface oxygen, potentially compromising the stability of the catalyst. The ideal catalyst should strike a balance between the ability to donate oxygen atoms during oxidation and the ability to heal oxygen vacancies with gas-phase oxygen.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过催化剂表面氧的移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，氧化物表面的氧原子与气相反应物（如CO）反应形成产物（如CO2）。这在表面上创造了一个氧空位。当气相氧填充这个空位时，催化循环完成，表面恢复到初始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示从表面移除氧更容易，这通常意味着更高的氧化能力和潜在的更好的催化活性。掺杂氧化物（例如在TiO2中掺杂Au）可以显著降低ΔEv，削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键。这使得掺杂的氧化物比纯氧化物具有更强的氧化能力。

然而，需要注意的是，需要一个最佳平衡。如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致表面氧的快速移除，可能会影响催化剂的稳定性。理想的催化剂应在氧化过程中提供氧原子的能力和用气相氧修复氧空位的能力之间取得平衡。
