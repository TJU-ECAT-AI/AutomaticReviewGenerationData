[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[4] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of oxygen removal from the catalyst surface and subsequent replenishment. Initially, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the molecule to be oxidized (e.g., CO), forming the oxidized product (e.g., CO2) and leaving behind an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. Then, gas-phase oxygen fills this vacancy, restoring the catalyst to its original state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that surface oxygen is more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant. This enhances its ability to oxidize reactant molecules. However, the ΔEv should not be too low, as this could lead to rapid removal of multiple oxygen atoms, potentially destabilizing the catalyst.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in balancing the catalyst's ability to donate oxygen for oxidation reactions and its capacity to replenish that oxygen from the gas phase. An optimal catalyst strikes a balance between these two processes, ensuring efficient oxidation while maintaining catalyst stability and allowing for the completion of the catalytic cycle.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过催化剂表面氧的移除和随后的补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧原子与待氧化分子（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在催化剂表面留下氧空位。然后，气相氧填补这个空位，使催化剂恢复到原始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这增强了其氧化反应物分子的能力。然而，ΔEv不应过低，因为这可能导致多个氧原子的快速移除，潜在地不稳定催化剂。

ΔEv的重要性在于其在平衡催化剂为氧化反应提供氧的能力和从气相补充氧的能力之间的作用。最佳催化剂在这两个过程之间取得平衡，确保高效氧化的同时保持催化剂稳定性，并允许催化循环的完成。
