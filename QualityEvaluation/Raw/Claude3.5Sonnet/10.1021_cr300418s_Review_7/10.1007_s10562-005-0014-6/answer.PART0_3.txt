[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[4] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle of surface oxygen removal and replenishment. Initially, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the molecule to be oxidized (e.g., CO), forming the oxidized product (e.g., CO2) and leaving behind an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface. Subsequently, gas-phase oxygen fills this vacancy, restoring the catalyst to its original state.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that surface oxygen is more easily removed, making the oxide a better oxidant and potentially a more active catalyst. However, the optimal catalyst requires a balance - if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or struggle to replenish its oxygen from the gas phase.

Doping the oxide with certain metals (like Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni) can significantly reduce ΔEv, enhancing the oxide's oxidizing power and catalytic activity. This effect is due to the weakening of the bond between surface oxygen atoms and the oxide lattice in the presence of the dopant.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过表面氧的移除和补充循环来运作。首先，表面氧原子与待氧化分子（如CO）反应，形成氧化产物（如CO2），并在氧化物表面留下氧空位。随后，气相氧填补这个空位，使催化剂恢复到原始状态。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，可能成为更活跃的催化剂。然而，最佳催化剂需要一个平衡 - 如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或难以从气相补充氧。

用某些金属（如Au、Ag、Cu、Pt、Pd、Ni）掺杂氧化物可以显著降低ΔEv，增强氧化物的氧化能力和催化活性。这种效果是由于掺杂剂的存在使表面氧原子与氧化物晶格之间的键合减弱。
