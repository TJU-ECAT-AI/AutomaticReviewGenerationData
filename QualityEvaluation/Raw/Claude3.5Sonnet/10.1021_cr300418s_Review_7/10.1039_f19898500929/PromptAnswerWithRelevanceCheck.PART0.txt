The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on CO and CO2 adsorption on cerium oxide (CeO2) surfaces studied by infrared spectroscopy. It does not provide specific information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

However, the document does mention that CO oxidation occurs on the CeO2 surface at room temperature, forming carbonate and carboxylate species. This implies that the CeO2 surface can be partially reduced by CO, which is consistent with the general concept of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism where lattice oxygen participates in oxidation reactions. The text suggests that surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions, rather than bulk lattice oxide ions, are responsible for this room temperature oxidation of CO on CeO2.

Mars-van Krevelen机制和氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）并未在给定的文献中直接讨论。该文本主要关注通过红外光谱研究的一氧化碳和二氧化碳在二氧化铈（CeO2）表面上的吸附。它没有提供关于Mars-van Krevelen机制或ΔEv在决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性的具体信息。

然而，文档确实提到一氧化碂在室温下在CeO2表面发生氧化，形成碳酸盐和羧酸盐物种。这意味着CeO2表面可以被CO部分还原，这与Mars-van Krevelen机制的一般概念一致，即晶格氧参与氧化反应。文本表明，表面氧物种和帽状氧离子，而不是体相晶格氧化物离子，负责CeO2上CO在室温下的这种氧化。

[1] "The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of CeO, is partially reduced by CO."

[2] "It is assumed that CO reacts directly with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form bidentate carbonate species, and then the bidentate carbonate species as an intermediate are converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species"

[3] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in this literature. However, the text does describe a similar process for CO oxidation on CeO2 surfaces. The mechanism involves CO reacting with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form carbonate species, which indicates partial reduction of the CeO2 surface. This process is similar to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not directly mentioned. However, the literature suggests that surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are more easily reduced than lattice oxide ions, implying a lower energy barrier for their removal. This difference in reducibility affects the catalytic activity, as evidenced by the formation of carbonate species even at room temperature.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is related to the ease of oxygen removal. The text indicates that surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are more readily available for oxidation reactions compared to bulk lattice oxygen, which requires higher temperatures (770 K and 1020 K) for reduction. This suggests that the surface's oxidizing ability is influenced by the type and location of oxygen species present.

这篇文献并没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文中确实描述了CeO2表面上CO氧化的类似过程。该机制涉及CO与表面氧物种和顶层氧离子反应形成碳酸盐物种，这表明CeO2表面被部分还原。这个过程类似于Mars-van Krevelen机制，其中晶格氧参与氧化反应。

文献中没有直接提到氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，文献表明表面氧物种和顶层氧离子比晶格氧离子更容易被还原，这意味着移除它们的能量障碍较低。这种还原性的差异影响了催化活性，这从即使在室温下也能形成碳酸盐物种的现象中可以看出。

氧化物表面的氧化能力与氧的易移除性有关。文中指出，与体相晶格氧相比，表面氧物种和顶层氧离子更容易参与氧化反应，而体相晶格氧需要更高的温度（770 K和1020 K）才能被还原。这表明表面的氧化能力受到存在的氧物种类型和位置的影响。

[1] "CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et aZ.20*2r Their results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain CO oxidation on CeO,."

[2] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively; another t.p.r. peak was due to oxygen species which could be converted into the capping and bulk oxygen ions."

[3] "The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, but the more important reason for CO oxidation at room temperature should be the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO to be oxidized easily."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does describe a related cyclic reduction/oxidation mechanism for CO oxidation on CeO2 surfaces, which involves the participation of lattice oxide ions. This is similar to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not directly mentioned in the text. However, the literature discusses the reduction of different types of oxygen species on CeO2 at different temperatures, which is related to the energy required to remove these oxygen atoms from the lattice. The text mentions that surface-capping oxygen ions are reduced at lower temperatures (770 K) compared to bulk oxygen ions (1020 K), suggesting that surface oxygen species require less energy to be removed and are thus more reactive.

The catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface are influenced by both the availability of reactive oxygen species and the presence of surface-active sites. The text emphasizes that while surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and carboxylate species, the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO is more important for CO oxidation at room temperature. This suggests that both the ease of oxygen removal (related to ΔEv) and the surface structure play crucial roles in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在给定的文献中没有明确讨论。然而，文本确实描述了CeO2表面上CO氧化的相关循环还原/氧化机制，其中涉及晶格氧离子的参与。这与Mars-van Krevelen机制类似。

文本中没有直接提到氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。但是，文献讨论了CeO2上不同类型的氧物种在不同温度下的还原，这与从晶格中移除这些氧原子所需的能量有关。文本提到表面覆盖氧离子在较低温度（770 K）下还原，而体相氧离子在较高温度（1020 K）下还原，这表明表面氧物种需要较少的能量就能被移除，因此更具反应性。

氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力受到活性氧物种的可用性和表面活性位点存在的影响。文本强调，虽然表面氧物种和覆盖氧离子对形成碳酸盐和羧酸盐物种是必要的，但对于室温下的CO氧化，能够活化CO的表面活性位点的存在更为重要。这表明，氧的易移除性（与ΔEv相关）和表面结构都在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
