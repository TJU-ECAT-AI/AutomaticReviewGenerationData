[1] "The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of CeO, is partially reduced by CO."

[2] "It is assumed that CO reacts directly with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form bidentate carbonate species, and then the bidentate carbonate species as an intermediate are converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species"

[3] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in this literature. However, the text does describe a similar process for CO oxidation on CeO2 surfaces. The mechanism involves CO reacting with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form carbonate species, which indicates partial reduction of the CeO2 surface. This process is similar to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not directly mentioned. However, the literature suggests that surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are more easily reduced than lattice oxide ions, implying a lower energy barrier for their removal. This difference in reducibility affects the catalytic activity, as evidenced by the formation of carbonate species even at room temperature.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is related to the ease of oxygen removal. The text indicates that surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are more readily available for oxidation reactions compared to bulk lattice oxygen, which requires higher temperatures (770 K and 1020 K) for reduction. This suggests that the surface's oxidizing ability is influenced by the type and location of oxygen species present.

这篇文献并没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文中确实描述了CeO2表面上CO氧化的类似过程。该机制涉及CO与表面氧物种和顶层氧离子反应形成碳酸盐物种，这表明CeO2表面被部分还原。这个过程类似于Mars-van Krevelen机制，其中晶格氧参与氧化反应。

文献中没有直接提到氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，文献表明表面氧物种和顶层氧离子比晶格氧离子更容易被还原，这意味着移除它们的能量障碍较低。这种还原性的差异影响了催化活性，这从即使在室温下也能形成碳酸盐物种的现象中可以看出。

氧化物表面的氧化能力与氧的易移除性有关。文中指出，与体相晶格氧相比，表面氧物种和顶层氧离子更容易参与氧化反应，而体相晶格氧需要更高的温度（770 K和1020 K）才能被还原。这表明表面的氧化能力受到存在的氧物种类型和位置的影响。
