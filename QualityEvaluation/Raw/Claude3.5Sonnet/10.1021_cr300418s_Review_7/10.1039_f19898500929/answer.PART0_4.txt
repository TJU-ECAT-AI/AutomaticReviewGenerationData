[1] "CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et aZ.20*2r Their results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain CO oxidation on CeO,."

[2] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively; another t.p.r. peak was due to oxygen species which could be converted into the capping and bulk oxygen ions."

[3] "The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, but the more important reason for CO oxidation at room temperature should be the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO to be oxidized easily."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does describe a related cyclic reduction/oxidation mechanism for CO oxidation on CeO2 surfaces, which involves the participation of lattice oxide ions. This is similar to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not directly mentioned in the text. However, the literature discusses the reduction of different types of oxygen species on CeO2 at different temperatures, which is related to the energy required to remove these oxygen atoms from the lattice. The text mentions that surface-capping oxygen ions are reduced at lower temperatures (770 K) compared to bulk oxygen ions (1020 K), suggesting that surface oxygen species require less energy to be removed and are thus more reactive.

The catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface are influenced by both the availability of reactive oxygen species and the presence of surface-active sites. The text emphasizes that while surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and carboxylate species, the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO is more important for CO oxidation at room temperature. This suggests that both the ease of oxygen removal (related to ΔEv) and the surface structure play crucial roles in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在给定的文献中没有明确讨论。然而，文本确实描述了CeO2表面上CO氧化的相关循环还原/氧化机制，其中涉及晶格氧离子的参与。这与Mars-van Krevelen机制类似。

文本中没有直接提到氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。但是，文献讨论了CeO2上不同类型的氧物种在不同温度下的还原，这与从晶格中移除这些氧原子所需的能量有关。文本提到表面覆盖氧离子在较低温度（770 K）下还原，而体相氧离子在较高温度（1020 K）下还原，这表明表面氧物种需要较少的能量就能被移除，因此更具反应性。

氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力受到活性氧物种的可用性和表面活性位点存在的影响。文本强调，虽然表面氧物种和覆盖氧离子对形成碳酸盐和羧酸盐物种是必要的，但对于室温下的CO氧化，能够活化CO的表面活性位点的存在更为重要。这表明，氧的易移除性（与ΔEv相关）和表面结构都在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
