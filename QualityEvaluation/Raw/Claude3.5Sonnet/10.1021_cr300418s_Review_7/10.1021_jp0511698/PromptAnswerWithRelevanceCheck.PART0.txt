The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on DFT+U calculations of ceria surfaces and oxygen vacancies, but does not provide information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or its relationship to catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. To properly answer this question, additional information from other sources would be required.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the electronic and atomic structures of clean and reduced ceria surfaces, but does not specifically address catalytic oxidation reactions or the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. While the text mentions oxygen vacancies and their formation energies, it does not relate these to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability in the context of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

该文献中没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制以及氧空位形成能(ΔEv)的重要性。文档主要关注纯净和还原的氧化铈表面的电子和原子结构,但没有具体讨论催化氧化反应或Mars-van Krevelen机制。虽然文中提到了氧空位及其形成能,但并没有将这些与Mars-van Krevelen机制背景下的催化活性或氧化能力联系起来。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the electronic and structural properties of ceria surfaces, particularly the (111) and (110) surfaces, and the formation of oxygen vacancies on these surfaces. It does not provide information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or how ΔEv relates to catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

However, based on the information provided about oxygen vacancies in ceria, we can infer some relevant points:

1. Oxygen vacancies tend to form more easily on surfaces than in the bulk, with the (110) surface being more favorable for vacancy formation than the (111) surface.

2. The formation of oxygen vacancies leads to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ ions, with the excess electrons localizing on two Ce atoms neighboring the vacancy.

3. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation is calculated and reported for different surfaces and methods, which could be related to the oxide's reactivity.

4. The presence of oxygen vacancies modifies the electronic structure of the surface, which could influence its catalytic properties.

While these points don't directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity, they provide insight into the behavior of oxygen vacancies in ceria, which is relevant to its catalytic properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机制以及氧空位形成能（ΔEv）的重要性在给定的文献中没有直接讨论。该文档主要关注氧化铈表面的电子和结构特性，特别是（111）和（110）表面，以及这些表面上氧空位的形成。它没有提供关于Mars-van Krevelen机制或ΔEv如何与催化活性和氧化能力相关的信息。

然而，根据文献中提供的关于氧化铈中氧空位的信息，我们可以推断出一些相关点：

1. 氧空位倾向于在表面比在体相中更容易形成，其中（110）表面比（111）表面更有利于空位形成。

2. 氧空位的形成导致Ce4+还原为Ce3+离子，多余的电子局域在邻近空位的两个Ce原子上。

3. 计算并报告了不同表面和方法下氧空位形成所需的能量，这可能与氧化物的反应性有关。

4. 氧空位的存在改变了表面的电子结构，这可能会影响其催化性质。

虽然这些点没有直接涉及Mars-van Krevelen机制或ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系，但它们提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位行为的洞察，这与其催化性质相关。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The document focuses on the electronic and structural properties of clean and reduced ceria surfaces, particularly the (111) and (110) surfaces, as studied through DFT+U calculations. It does not contain information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or its significance in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

However, the document does discuss oxygen vacancy formation energies on ceria surfaces, which are related to the concept of ΔEv. The study shows that oxygen vacancies tend to form more easily on surfaces than in the bulk, and preferentially on the (110) surface compared to the (111) surface. This suggests that the (110) surface may be more reactive or catalytically active. While not explicitly stated, this information implies that surfaces with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies might be more active in catalytic oxidation reactions.

然而，该文档确实讨论了氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能，这与ΔEv的概念相关。研究表明，氧空位在表面比在体相中更容易形成，并且在(110)表面比在(111)表面更容易形成。这表明(110)表面可能更具反应性或催化活性。虽然没有明确说明，但这些信息暗示了具有较低氧空位形成能的表面可能在催化氧化反应中更活跃。
