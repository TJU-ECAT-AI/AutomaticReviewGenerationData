[1] "Ceria is one of the most interesting oxides industrially because it can readily create oxygen vacancies and whereby Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+. This property gives ceria its high oxygen storage capacity as well as its catalytic properties;"

[2] "Knowing the local structure, clustering properties and mobility of the oxygen vacancies on surfaces of ceria is of paramount importance for understanding their catalytic roles, both in the context of supported noble metals and in relation to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria."

[3] "Daturi et al. [10] found that the deNOx activity (i.e. the ability to remove nitrogen oxides, NOx, namely NO2, NO, N2O) of oxide-based catalysts such as ceria can be correlated to the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies present at the surface."

[4] "Daturi et al. [10] proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on CeO2 surfaces, where the two oxygen atoms of two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies, thus acting as reoxidizing agents on the prereduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms combine to give rise to a N2 molecule."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, oxygen vacancies play a crucial role. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

For ceria specifically, its ability to readily create oxygen vacancies, where Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+, gives it high oxygen storage capacity and catalytic properties. The local structure, clustering properties, and mobility of these oxygen vacancies on ceria surfaces are crucial for understanding its catalytic roles.

The concentration of surface oxygen vacancies correlates with the deNOx activity (ability to remove nitrogen oxides) of oxide-based catalysts like ceria. In the proposed mechanism for NO dissociation on CeO2 surfaces, two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies. The oxygen atoms act as reoxidizing agents on the pre-reduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms combine to form N2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences how easily these vacancies can be created and filled, which in turn affects the catalyst's ability to participate in oxidation reactions. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation and healing of oxygen vacancies. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become too easily reduced, potentially limiting its oxidizing ability. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv is crucial for balancing catalytic activity and oxidizing ability in oxide catalysts like ceria.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机制中，氧空位起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。

具体到氧化铈，它容易创造氧空位的能力，即Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+，赋予了它高氧储存能力和催化特性。这些氧空位在氧化铈表面的局部结构、聚集特性和移动性对于理解其催化作用至关重要。

表面氧空位的浓度与氧化铈等氧化物基催化剂的脱硝活性（去除氮氧化物的能力）相关。在CeO2表面NO分解的提议机制中，两个NO分子填充两个相邻的氧空位。氧原子作为预还原表面的再氧化剂，而氮原子结合形成N2。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）影响这些空位的创建和填充难易程度，进而影响催化剂参与氧化反应的能力。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许更容易形成和愈合氧空位。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得太容易被还原，可能限制其氧化能力。因此，最佳的ΔEv对于平衡氧化铈等氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。
