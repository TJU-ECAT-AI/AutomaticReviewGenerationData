[1] "Ceria is one of the most interesting oxides industrially because it can readily create oxygen vacancies and whereby Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+. This property gives ceria its high oxygen storage capacity as well as its catalytic properties;"

[2] "Knowing the local structure, clustering properties and mobility of the oxygen vacancies on surfaces of ceria is of paramount importance for understanding their catalytic roles, both in the context of supported noble metals and in relation to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria."

[3] "Daturi et al. [10] proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on CeO2 surfaces, where the two oxygen atoms of two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies, thus acting as reoxidizing agents on the prereduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms combine to give rise to a N2 molecule."

[4] "The formation energy (ΔEv) for a single surface oxygen vacancy calculated using Eq. (2) is 2.10 eV"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, oxygen vacancies are created on the oxide surface as lattice oxygen is consumed in the oxidation of reactants. These vacancies are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or other oxidizing species.

For ceria specifically, its ability to readily create oxygen vacancies by reducing Ce4+ to Ce3+ is key to its catalytic properties and oxygen storage capacity. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical parameter that influences both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation and healing of oxygen vacancies. This facilitates the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and enables more efficient catalytic cycles.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ΔEv also relates to the oxide's oxidizing power. A higher ΔEv suggests stronger metal-oxygen bonds, which can translate to stronger oxidizing ability but may reduce the ease of vacancy formation.

3. Oxygen storage capacity: For ceria, its high oxygen storage capacity is directly related to its ability to form and heal oxygen vacancies. The ΔEv influences how readily this process occurs.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The ΔEv affects the likelihood of certain reaction pathways. For example, in NO dissociation on ceria, the ability to form neighboring oxygen vacancies influences the proposed mechanism where two NO molecules fill these vacancies and then combine to form N2.

5. Surface reactivity: The ease of vacancy formation, determined by ΔEv, affects the overall reactivity of the oxide surface towards various adsorbates and reactants.

In summary, the ΔEv is a crucial parameter that helps determine the balance between the oxide's ability to provide reactive oxygen species and its capacity to regenerate its active sites, both of which are essential for effective catalytic performance in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这种机制中，当晶格氧在反应物的氧化过程中被消耗时，氧化物表面会形成氧空位。这些空位随后被气相氧或其他氧化物种重新填充。

对于二氧化铈来说，其通过将Ce4+还原为Ce3+而容易形成氧空位的能力是其催化性能和氧储存能力的关键。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是一个关键参数，它影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的催化活性，因为它允许更容易形成和愈合氧空位。这促进了Mars-van Krevelen机理，并实现了更高效的催化循环。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv也与氧化物的氧化能力有关。较高的ΔEv表明金属-氧键更强，这可能转化为更强的氧化能力，但可能降低空位形成的容易程度。

3. 氧储存能力：对于二氧化铈，其高氧储存能力直接与其形成和愈合氧空位的能力有关。ΔEv影响这个过程发生的容易程度。

4. 反应机理：ΔEv影响某些反应途径的可能性。例如，在二氧化铈上的NO分解中，形成相邻氧空位的能力影响了提议的机理，即两个NO分子填充这些空位然后结合形成N2。

5. 表面反应性：由ΔEv决定的空位形成的容易程度影响氧化物表面对各种吸附物和反应物的整体反应性。

总之，ΔEv是一个关键参数，它有助于确定氧化物提供活性氧物种的能力和再生其活性位点的能力之间的平衡，这两者对于氧化反应中的有效催化性能都是至关重要的。
