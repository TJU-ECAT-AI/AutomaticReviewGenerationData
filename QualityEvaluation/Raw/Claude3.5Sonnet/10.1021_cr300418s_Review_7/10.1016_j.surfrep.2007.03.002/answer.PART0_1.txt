[1] "Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications."

[2] "Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems."

The given literature does not provide specific information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. The document mentions the importance of oxygen vacancies in technological applications and discusses the electronic structure changes upon vacancy formation, but it does not directly address the question asked.
