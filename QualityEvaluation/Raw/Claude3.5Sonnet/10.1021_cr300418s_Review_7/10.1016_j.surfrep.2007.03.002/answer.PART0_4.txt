[1] "Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications."

[2] "Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems."

The document does not provide specific information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. The literature focuses on reviewing theoretical data for structural and electronic properties related to oxygen defects in transition metal and rare earth oxide surfaces, but does not discuss the specific catalytic mechanism or the role of ΔEv in catalysis.
