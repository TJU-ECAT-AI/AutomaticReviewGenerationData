<quotes>

[1] "Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications."

[2] "Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions are not directly discussed in the given literature. The text mentions the importance of oxygen vacancies in transition metal and rare earth oxide surfaces for various applications, but does not provide specific details about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the role of ΔEv in catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. The literature focuses more on the structural and electronic properties of oxygen vacancies, as well as the theoretical methods used to study them.
