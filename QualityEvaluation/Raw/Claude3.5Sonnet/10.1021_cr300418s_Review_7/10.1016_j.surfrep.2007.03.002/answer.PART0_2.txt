[1] "Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications."

[2] "Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions are not explicitly discussed in the provided literature. The text mentions the importance of oxygen vacancies in transition metal and rare earth oxide surfaces for various technological applications, but does not go into detail about specific catalytic mechanisms or the role of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. To fully answer this question, additional information from other sources would be required.
