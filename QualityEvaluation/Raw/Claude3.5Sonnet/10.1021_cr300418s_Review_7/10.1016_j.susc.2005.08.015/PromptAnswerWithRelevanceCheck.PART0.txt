[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the oxide surface provides oxygen to oxidize adsorbed molecules, creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

For ceria specifically, its oxygen storage capability (OSC) allows it to oxidize or reduce molecules depending on the reaction conditions. Ceria can oxidize a molecule by releasing oxygen atoms, which reduces the surface. Conversely, a reduced ceria surface can promote the reduction of a molecule by taking up an oxygen atom from that molecule.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the surface can more easily release oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. However, the relationship between ΔEv and surface stability is not straightforward. The study found that vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces. For example, the (110) surface of ceria has the lowest vacancy formation energy, despite not being the least stable surface.

This finding suggests that the catalytic activity of different ceria surfaces cannot be predicted solely based on the stability of the pure surfaces. The ease of oxygen vacancy formation, as indicated by ΔEv, plays a significant role in determining the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions and its overall catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机理中，氧化物表面提供氧来氧化吸附的分子，在表面上创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧重新填充，完成催化循环。

具体对于氧化铈而言，其氧储存能力（OSC）使其能够根据反应条件氧化或还原分子。氧化铈可以通过释放氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原表面。相反，还原的氧化铈表面可以通过从分子中吸收氧原子来促进分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面可以更容易地释放氧，可能导致更高的氧化反应催化活性。然而，ΔEv和表面稳定性之间的关系并不简单。研究发现，空位形成能量不一定遵循纯表面稳定性的顺序。例如，氧化铈的（110）表面具有最低的空位形成能，尽管它不是最不稳定的表面。

这一发现表明，不同氧化铈表面的催化活性不能仅基于纯表面的稳定性来预测。氧空位形成的容易程度（由ΔEv指示）在决定表面参与氧化反应的能力和其整体催化性能方面起着重要作用。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction and re-oxidation of the catalyst surface. In this process, the catalyst's lattice oxygen participates directly in the oxidation of adsorbed molecules. For ceria specifically:

1. The surface oxygen atoms oxidize adsorbed molecules, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of the surface.

2. The reduced surface can then be re-oxidized by taking up oxygen from other molecules or from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. However, the relationship is not always straightforward, as shown by the study's findings that vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the trend of surface stabilities.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ΔEv influences the oxide's ability to release and uptake oxygen. A lower ΔEv suggests the surface can more readily release oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially increasing its oxidizing ability.

3. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC): The ΔEv is closely related to the material's OSC, which is vital for applications like automotive catalysis where the catalyst needs to operate under fluctuating conditions.

4. Surface structure: The study shows that atomic relaxation around the vacancy significantly affects the ΔEv, indicating that surface structure and reconstruction play important roles in determining catalytic properties.

Understanding these factors is crucial for designing and optimizing oxide catalysts for specific applications, as they directly influence the catalyst's performance in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及催化剂表面的还原和再氧化。在这个过程中，催化剂的晶格氧直接参与吸附分子的氧化。对于氧化铈来说：

1. 表面氧原子氧化吸附的分子，导致氧空位的形成和表面的还原。

2. 还原后的表面可以通过从其他分子或气相中吸收氧而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示氧空位形成更容易，这可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，这种关系并不总是直接的，正如研究发现，空位形成能并不一定遵循表面稳定性的趋势。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv影响氧化物释放和吸收氧的能力。较低的ΔEv表明表面可以更容易地释放氧用于氧化反应，可能增加其氧化能力。

3. 氧储存能力（OSC）：ΔEv与材料的OSC密切相关，这对于汽车催化等需要在波动条件下运行的催化剂应用至关重要。

4. 表面结构：研究表明，空位周围的原子弛豫显著影响ΔEv，表明表面结构和重构在决定催化性能方面起着重要作用。

理解这些因素对于设计和优化特定应用的氧化物催化剂至关重要，因为它们直接影响催化剂在氧化反应中的性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxidation of a molecule by oxygen from the oxide surface, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced surface by gas-phase oxygen. In this process, ceria can oxidize a molecule by losing oxygen atoms, reducing its surface. The reduced surface can then promote reduction of another molecule by taking up an oxygen atom from it.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because it relates to how easily the surface can release and uptake oxygen. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to create oxygen vacancies needed for the reaction. However, the study found that vacancy formation energies don't necessarily correlate with surface stability as previously thought. The (110) surface had the lowest vacancy formation energy despite not being the least stable surface.

This finding suggests that the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces cannot be predicted solely based on surface stability. The atomic relaxation around the vacancy plays a crucial role in determining the vacancy formation energy. This has implications for choosing surfaces for catalytic applications, as the most unstable perfect surface may not always be the most catalytically active.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面的氧气对分子的氧化，随后还原的表面被气相氧气重新氧化。在这个过程中，二氧化铈可以通过失去氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原其表面。还原后的表面可以通过从另一个分子中吸收氧原子来促进该分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定催化活性和氧化能力很重要，因为它与表面释放和吸收氧气的难易程度有关。较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为更容易创建反应所需的氧空位。然而，研究发现空位形成能并不一定与表面稳定性相关，这与之前的认知不同。(110)表面具有最低的空位形成能，尽管它不是最不稳定的表面。

这一发现表明，二氧化铈表面的催化活性和氧化能力不能仅基于表面稳定性来预测。空位周围的原子松弛在决定空位形成能方面起着关键作用。这对选择催化应用的表面有影响，因为最不稳定的完美表面可能并不总是最具催化活性的。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the catalyst surface is reduced as it provides oxygen to oxidize the reactant molecule, and is then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen. 

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may bind oxygen too weakly, reducing its oxidizing ability.

The document suggests that less stable surfaces are often considered more favorable for oxygen vacancy formation and thus more catalytically active. However, it also notes that this is not always the case, as the study found that vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the trend of surface stabilities.

The ability to accurately calculate ΔEv is crucial for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior. The study employs advanced computational methods (DFT+U) to obtain consistent and accurate descriptions of both pure and defective ceria surfaces, which is essential for meaningful computation of catalytic reaction energetics involving these surfaces.

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面可以更容易地提供晶格氧用于氧化反应，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能与氧的结合过弱，降低其氧化能力。

文档提出，不稳定的表面通常被认为更有利于氧空位的形成，因此催化活性更高。但是，研究也指出这并不总是如此，因为研究发现空位形成能并不一定遵循表面稳定性的趋势。

准确计算ΔEv的能力对于理解和预测催化行为至关重要。该研究采用先进的计算方法（DFT+U）来获得纯净和缺陷氧化铈表面的一致和准确描述，这对于有意义地计算涉及这些表面的催化反应能量至关重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cyclic process where the oxide surface provides lattice oxygen to oxidize adsorbed molecules, creating oxygen vacancies, which are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. In this mechanism, ceria can oxidize molecules by losing surface oxygen atoms, reducing the surface. The reduced surface can then promote reduction of other molecules by taking up oxygen from them.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Generally, surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are considered more favorable for forming oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active. This is because a lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, making it more readily available for oxidation reactions.

However, the study shows that the relationship between surface stability, vacancy formation energy, and catalytic activity is not always straightforward. The vacancy formation energies of different ceria surfaces do not necessarily follow the trend indicated by the stabilities of the pure surfaces. This suggests that the catalytic activity of a surface cannot be predicted solely based on the stability of its perfect form, and other factors such as atomic relaxation around the vacancy also play important roles.

The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria, which is crucial for its catalytic applications, is directly related to its ability to form and heal oxygen vacancies. A comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies is therefore vital for understanding and optimizing the catalytic performance of ceria-based materials.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过循环过程运作，其中氧化物表面提供晶格氧来氧化吸附分子，创造氧空位，然后这些空位被气相氧重新填充。在这种机制中，氧化铈可以通过失去表面氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原表面。还原后的表面随后可以通过从其他分子吸收氧来促进这些分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。通常，具有较低空位形成能的表面被认为更有利于形成氧空位，因此催化活性更高。这是因为较低的ΔEv表明从表面去除氧更容易，使其更容易参与氧化反应。

然而，该研究表明，表面稳定性、空位形成能和催化活性之间的关系并不总是直接的。不同氧化铈表面的空位形成能并不一定遵循纯表面稳定性所指示的趋势。这表明表面的催化活性不能仅基于其完美形态的稳定性来预测，其他因素如空位周围的原子松弛也起着重要作用。

氧化铈的氧储存能力（OSC）对其催化应用至关重要，直接与其形成和愈合氧空位的能力相关。因此，全面了解氧空位对于理解和优化基于氧化铈的材料的催化性能至关重要。
