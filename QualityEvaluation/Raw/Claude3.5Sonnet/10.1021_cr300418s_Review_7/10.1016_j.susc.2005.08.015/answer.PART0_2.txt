[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[3] "We find instead that the vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces do not follow the trend indicated by the stabilities of the pure surfaces."

[4] "The stability of oxygen vacancies is thus not necessarily determined by the stability of the pure surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxidation of a molecule by oxygen from the oxide surface, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced surface by gas-phase oxygen. In this process, ceria can oxidize a molecule by losing oxygen atoms, reducing its surface. The reduced surface can then promote reduction of another molecule by taking up an oxygen atom from it.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because it relates to how easily the surface can release and uptake oxygen. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to create oxygen vacancies needed for the reaction. However, the study found that vacancy formation energies don't necessarily correlate with surface stability as previously thought. The (110) surface had the lowest vacancy formation energy despite not being the least stable surface.

This finding suggests that the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces cannot be predicted solely based on surface stability. The atomic relaxation around the vacancy plays a crucial role in determining the vacancy formation energy. This has implications for choosing surfaces for catalytic applications, as the most unstable perfect surface may not always be the most catalytically active.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面的氧气对分子的氧化，随后还原的表面被气相氧气重新氧化。在这个过程中，二氧化铈可以通过失去氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原其表面。还原后的表面可以通过从另一个分子中吸收氧原子来促进该分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定催化活性和氧化能力很重要，因为它与表面释放和吸收氧气的难易程度有关。较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为更容易创建反应所需的氧空位。然而，研究发现空位形成能并不一定与表面稳定性相关，这与之前的认知不同。(110)表面具有最低的空位形成能，尽管它不是最不稳定的表面。

这一发现表明，二氧化铈表面的催化活性和氧化能力不能仅基于表面稳定性来预测。空位周围的原子松弛在决定空位形成能方面起着关键作用。这对选择催化应用的表面有影响，因为最不稳定的完美表面可能并不总是最具催化活性的。
