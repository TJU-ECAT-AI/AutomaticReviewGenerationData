[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[4] "For the calculation of the surface vacancy formation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems which contain Ce—these species need to be described by a consistent approach—and GGA-DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are correctly described by GGA-DFT."

[5] "It is generally taken to be the case that less stable surfaces will be more favourable for the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cyclic process where the oxide surface provides lattice oxygen to oxidize adsorbed molecules, creating oxygen vacancies, which are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. In this mechanism, ceria can oxidize molecules by losing surface oxygen atoms, reducing the surface. The reduced surface can then promote reduction of other molecules by taking up oxygen from them.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Generally, surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are considered more favorable for forming oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active. This is because a lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, making it more readily available for oxidation reactions.

However, the study shows that the relationship between surface stability, vacancy formation energy, and catalytic activity is not always straightforward. The vacancy formation energies of different ceria surfaces do not necessarily follow the trend indicated by the stabilities of the pure surfaces. This suggests that the catalytic activity of a surface cannot be predicted solely based on the stability of its perfect form, and other factors such as atomic relaxation around the vacancy also play important roles.

The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria, which is crucial for its catalytic applications, is directly related to its ability to form and heal oxygen vacancies. A comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies is therefore vital for understanding and optimizing the catalytic performance of ceria-based materials.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过循环过程运作，其中氧化物表面提供晶格氧来氧化吸附分子，创造氧空位，然后这些空位被气相氧重新填充。在这种机制中，氧化铈可以通过失去表面氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原表面。还原后的表面随后可以通过从其他分子吸收氧来促进这些分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。通常，具有较低空位形成能的表面被认为更有利于形成氧空位，因此催化活性更高。这是因为较低的ΔEv表明从表面去除氧更容易，使其更容易参与氧化反应。

然而，该研究表明，表面稳定性、空位形成能和催化活性之间的关系并不总是直接的。不同氧化铈表面的空位形成能并不一定遵循纯表面稳定性所指示的趋势。这表明表面的催化活性不能仅基于其完美形态的稳定性来预测，其他因素如空位周围的原子松弛也起着重要作用。

氧化铈的氧储存能力（OSC）对其催化应用至关重要，直接与其形成和愈合氧空位的能力相关。因此，全面了解氧空位对于理解和优化基于氧化铈的材料的催化性能至关重要。
