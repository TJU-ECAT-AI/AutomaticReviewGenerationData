[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[4] "To investigate an origin for this result, we have taken the surface structures in which the vacancy has been formed and carried out an electronic relaxation (without allowing the atomic positions to relax). The ordering of the vacancy formation energies follows that of the surface stability of the pure surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction and re-oxidation of the catalyst surface. In this process, the catalyst's lattice oxygen participates directly in the oxidation of adsorbed molecules. For ceria specifically:

1. The surface oxygen atoms oxidize adsorbed molecules, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of the surface.

2. The reduced surface can then be re-oxidized by taking up oxygen from other molecules or from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. However, the relationship is not always straightforward, as shown by the study's findings that vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the trend of surface stabilities.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ΔEv influences the oxide's ability to release and uptake oxygen. A lower ΔEv suggests the surface can more readily release oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially increasing its oxidizing ability.

3. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC): The ΔEv is closely related to the material's OSC, which is vital for applications like automotive catalysis where the catalyst needs to operate under fluctuating conditions.

4. Surface structure: The study shows that atomic relaxation around the vacancy significantly affects the ΔEv, indicating that surface structure and reconstruction play important roles in determining catalytic properties.

Understanding these factors is crucial for designing and optimizing oxide catalysts for specific applications, as they directly influence the catalyst's performance in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及催化剂表面的还原和再氧化。在这个过程中，催化剂的晶格氧直接参与吸附分子的氧化。对于氧化铈来说：

1. 表面氧原子氧化吸附的分子，导致氧空位的形成和表面的还原。

2. 还原后的表面可以通过从其他分子或气相中吸收氧而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示氧空位形成更容易，这可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，这种关系并不总是直接的，正如研究发现，空位形成能并不一定遵循表面稳定性的趋势。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv影响氧化物释放和吸收氧的能力。较低的ΔEv表明表面可以更容易地释放氧用于氧化反应，可能增加其氧化能力。

3. 氧储存能力（OSC）：ΔEv与材料的OSC密切相关，这对于汽车催化等需要在波动条件下运行的催化剂应用至关重要。

4. 表面结构：研究表明，空位周围的原子弛豫显著影响ΔEv，表明表面结构和重构在决定催化性能方面起着重要作用。

理解这些因素对于设计和优化特定应用的氧化物催化剂至关重要，因为它们直接影响催化剂在氧化反应中的性能。
