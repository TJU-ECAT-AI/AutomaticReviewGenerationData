[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a compre-hensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[3] "It is generally taken to be the case that less stable surfaces will be more favourable for the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus more cat-alytically active."

[4] "For the calculation of the surface vacancy for-mation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems which contain Cethese species need to be de-scribed by a consistent approachand GGA-DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are correctly described by GGA-DFT."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the catalyst surface is reduced as it provides oxygen to oxidize the reactant molecule, and is then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen. 

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may bind oxygen too weakly, reducing its oxidizing ability.

The document suggests that less stable surfaces are often considered more favorable for oxygen vacancy formation and thus more catalytically active. However, it also notes that this is not always the case, as the study found that vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the trend of surface stabilities.

The ability to accurately calculate ΔEv is crucial for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior. The study employs advanced computational methods (DFT+U) to obtain consistent and accurate descriptions of both pure and defective ceria surfaces, which is essential for meaningful computation of catalytic reaction energetics involving these surfaces.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，催化剂表面在为反应分子提供氧化所需的氧时被还原，然后被气相氧重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面可以更容易地提供晶格氧用于氧化反应，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能与氧的结合过弱，降低其氧化能力。

文档提出，不稳定的表面通常被认为更有利于氧空位的形成，因此催化活性更高。但是，研究也指出这并不总是如此，因为研究发现空位形成能并不一定遵循表面稳定性的趋势。

准确计算ΔEv的能力对于理解和预测催化行为至关重要。该研究采用先进的计算方法（DFT+U）来获得纯净和缺陷氧化铈表面的一致和准确描述，这对于有意义地计算涉及这些表面的催化反应能量至关重要。
