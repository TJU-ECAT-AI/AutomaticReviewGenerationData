Abstract
Ceria, CeO2, plays an important role in catalysis, participating directly in the conversion of environmentally sensitive
molecules. This arises from the ability of ceria to store and release oxygen depending upon the conditions present in the
exhaust gas. Obtaining a basic understanding of oxygen vacancy defects in ceria and the interaction of defective struc-
tures with such molecules is central to our understanding of the role of ceria in catalysis. In this work we examine using
first principles density functional theory (DFT), with the inclusion of on site electronic correlations (DFT + U), the
geometry and electronic structure of (111), (110) and (100) ceria surfaces that include oxygen vacancies. We find
for all surfaces that the surface (atomistic) structure is strongly perturbed and the extraction of an oxygen vacancy
is associated with a reduction of two neighbouring Ce(IV) species to Ce(III) rather than partial reduction of all Ce ions
in the simulation cell. In the electronic density of states a new gap state appears between the top of the valence band and
the bottom of the unoccupied Ce 4f states. Localisation of charge due to the gap state and excess spin density on Ce3+
sites neighbouring the vacancy is observed for all three surfaces. These DFT + U results are validated by recent exper-
imental results regarding the electronic structure of reduced ceria surfaces, in contrast to previous DFT results. We
observe an interesting result that the vacancy formation energies do not follow the same order as the stabilities of
the pure surfaces, as measured by the surface energy; thus, the (110) surface has the lowest vacancy formation energy.
The impact of this for the study of catalytic reactions on ceria surfaces is discussed.

from diesel engines, removal of organics from
wastewater, an additive for combustion catalysis
and in redox and electrochemical reactions. It has
been demonstrated that the catalytic oxidation of
CO on Pt is enhanced by the presence of a ceria sup-
port [2], while reduction of NO2 and NO on Rh is
also enhanced by using a ceria support material
[3]. However in these systems, ceria is not merely
an inactive support [13] and can itself act as a cat-
alyst for these reactions. In identifying and separat-
ing out the roles of ceria within a catalyst, it is has
become important to study the reactivity and chem-
isorptive properties of ceria surfaces.
The importance of ceria in catalysis can be
understood from its oxygen storage capability,
OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise
or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions
in the reactor stream. Ceria can oxidise a molecule,
by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the sur-
face. A reduced surface can promote reduction of
a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom
from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1. The
reduction and re-oxidation of ceria is relatively
facile, being possible in the conditions present in
e.g. the exhaust gas at the temperatures present
during operation of a motor engine. In order to
understand better this process, it is necessary to
characterise the nature of reduced ceria surfaces.
Upon formation of neutral oxygen vacancies in
the surface of the ceria support, two electrons re-
main. Using KrogerVink notation, we can write
the vacancy formation reaction as
Ox
o  2Cex
Ce ! V
o  2Ce0
Ce  1=2O2
In this picture of defect formation, two electrons
from the oxygen atom are transferred to two
cerium ions neighbouring the vacancy site, so that
these cerium ions are reduced from the +4 state to
the +3 state. After formation of the vacancies,
reactive sites are present, which can then interact
with a molecule such as NO2 or NO, allowing
the reduction of these molecules. The oxygen atom
released from the molecule causes partial reoxida-
tion of the surface. CO can be oxidised to CO2 by
extraction of oxygen from the surface, while the
surface itself is reduced.
Given their importance for the oxygen storage
capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a compre-
hensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in
this material. Some experimental work regarding
defective surfaces has been published. Recent
experimental data has demonstrated that partial
reduction of the (111) and (110) surfaces of ceria
results in the presence of a new peak in the valence
band photoemission spectrum (UPS) [46], which
is due to the formation of Ce3+ ions. The gap state
is found to be 1.50 eV above the valence band for
the (111) surface and 2.00 eV above the valence
band for the (110) surface. While similar UPS
data for vacancies on the (100) surface is lacking,
the general findings for the defective (111) and
(110) surfaces [46] are expected to be unchanged
for this surface. The nature of the reduced surface
is important, e.g. which Ce ions are reduced to the
3+ state, the two Ce ions neighbouring the va-
cancy site or is there delocalisation over the Ce
ions of the surface? The understanding is that
upon formation of the oxygen vacancy, the two
electrons remaining are localised on two Ce ions
neighbouring the vacancy site, which are reduced
to Ce3+. The localisation of the electrons on these
Ce ions can be understood from the electrical con-
ductivity [1,7]; if the electrons were not localised,
we might expect a large increase in conductivity,
consistent with delocalisation of electrons in an
electronic band over the whole structure. How-
ever, this is not observed to be the case, with low
conductivity observed for reduced ceria [1] and in
[7], the difficulty of obtaining scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) images of defects, due to the
low conductivity, has been discussed. STM and
atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been applied
to image defects in the (111) surface, e.g. with
AFM, individual defect sites have been imaged

[9]. With a high defect concentration, triangular
defect clusters have also been observed [79].
These defect structures can then aggregate to lin-
ear defects along the surface. Interatomic potential
(IP) studies have shown that clustering of multiple
defects is more favourable than isolated defects
[10,11].
Interatomic potential studies of the energetics of
oxygen vacancy formation in bulk ceria has been
presented [10,11]; however, structural changes in
the surface have not been considered. Sayle et al.
have concluded that vacancy formation in the sur-
faces is more favourable than in bulk [10], and have
further calculated that the formation energy in the
(110) surface is lower (more favourable) than that
for the (111) surface. These conclusions were
rationalised on the basis of the surface energies
and structures of the pure surfaces. Rather surpris-
ingly, there have been few subsequent IP studies of
reduced ceria surfaces.
Skorodumova et al. have studied bulk and fully
reduced ceria (Ce2O3), in which all Ce ions are re-
duced to Ce3+, using GGA-DFT [12]. In order to
obtain a reasonably consistent description of both
oxidation states, the nature of the Ce 4f states was
chosen beforehand, i.e. for bulk ceria, the 4f states
were treated as valence, while for the reduced
material, the Ce 4f states were treated as part of
the corethis causes these states to be localised.
However, this user-defined input into the calcu-
lation does not allow for a consistent and satis-
factory description of pure and defective ceria
surfaces. Yang et al. recently published a study
of defects in the (111) and (110) surfaces also
from GGA-DFT [13]. These authors treated the
Ce 4f states as valence. They obtained a descrip-
tion of surface modifications due to vacancy
formation; however, their description of the elec-
tronic structure of the reduced surfaces is com-
pletely inconsistent with experiment, in that they
find delocalisation of charge density and no gap
state between the valence band and the unoccupied
Ce 4f states. This must cast some doubt on their
computed reduction energies. Finally, this work
is inconsistent with Ref. [12]. These studies show
that a consistent treatment of pure and reduced
ceria is needed so that catalytic reactions and the
initial stages of same can be treated consistently.
In respect of this there have been recent studies
of partially reduced bulk ceria from Fabris et al.
[14] and the partially reduced (100) surface from
Nolan et al. [15]. In both studies, the DFT + U
methodology was applied. This approach corrects
for the incorrect description of highly localised
partially occupied d and f states in metal oxides
by adding a correction for on-site Coulomb inter-
actions. The work of Ref. [14] demonstrates that
DFT + U provides a consistent description of bulk
ceria, regardless of the Ce oxidation state.
However, for catalytic reactions, we need to
study surfaces of ceria and a consistent description
of the geometric and electronic properties of both
pure and defective surfaces is needed. The prelimin-
ary study of Ref. [15] is a fully consistent first prin-
ciples (ab initio) study of both pure and defective
ceria surfaces. It was demonstrated that applying
GGA-DFT to the defective (100) ceria surface pro-
duces an inconsistent description of the electronic
structure, which is similar to that of Ref. [13].
The DFT + U approach was applied to recover a
proper description of the electronic structure [15].
Furthermore the importance of self-consistent
ionic relaxations within the DFT + U approach
was demonstrated.
In this paper we will present a comprehensive
study of the geometry and electronic structure of
oxygen vacancy defects in the low index (111),
(110) and (100) surfaces of ceria. Since a number
of studies have already shown that GGA-DFT is
unable to describe oxygen vacancies in ceria [13
15], we will focus entirely on the DFT + U descrip-
tion of the electronic structure of oxygen vacancies
in the low index surfaces of ceria.
2. Methods
All calculations presented herein were carried
out with the VASP program [16]. The valence elec-
tronic states are expanded in a basis of plane
waves. The strongly oscillating wave functions of
the core electrons are represented using the projec-
tor augmented wave (PAW) approach. This is
essentially an all-electron calculation with a frozen
core [17], to describe the core-valence interaction;
we use [He] and [Xe] cores for oxygen and cerium.

The exchange correlation functional is the general-
ised gradient approximation, GGA, of Perdew and
Wang, PW91 [18].
DFT + U is chosen as our computational
approach, due to the inability of GGA-DFT to
describe the Ce 4f electronic states which result
from formation of oxygen vacancies in ceria.
GGA-DFT fails, due to use of approximate ex-
changecorrelation functionals, which means that
cancellation with the Hartree interaction for a sin-
gle electron is not guaranteed. This introduces an
electron self-interaction error (SIE), so that the
electron has a Coulomb interaction with itself.
The SIE penalizes localisation of electrons in
partially occupied d and f electronic states and
favours delocalisation of electrons in these states.
The DFT + U formalism introduces an on-site
Coulomb interaction in these states, characterised
by the parameter U, which reduces the SIE and
allows electrons to be localised in d or f electronic
states. The upshot of this is that a gap opens up
between the fully occupied states and the remain-
ing unoccupied states; the U parameter controls
this energy gap. More detailed information on
the DFT + U approach is given in [19].
In a DFT + U calculation, the U parameter is
determined empirically and we describe in [15]
the sensitivity of the results to the value of U for
the defective (100) surface and from that work
choose a value of 5 eV for U for all calculations
presented herein. This value of U shows no sensi-
tivity to the nature of the defective surface. We
also apply DFT + U to the pure surfaces, having
demonstrated in Ref. [15] the insensitivity of the
description of the pure surfaces to the DFT + U
formalism.
The surfaces are represented as slabs within the
3-D periodic boundary conditions, and are sepa-
rated from their images in the direction perpendic-
ular to the surface by a 15 A
 vacuum gap, which is
sufficient to ensure that the slabs are far enough
apart to prevent unphysical interactions between
the slab and its periodic images perpendicular to
the surface. For the (111) surface a slab 10.5 A
(12 atomic layers) thick is used, for the (110) sur-
face a thickness of 11.5 A
 (7 atomic layers) is used
and for the (100) surface, we have a 10.94 A
 (9 lay-
ers) thick slab. For the (111) and (100) surfaces,
we use a p(2 · 2) expansion of the surface unit cell
and for the (110) surface, we use a p(2 · 1) expan-
sion. Expansion of the surface unit cell in this fash-
ion contributes to a reduction in the defectdefect
interactions that are present in periodic supercell
calculations. With four oxygen atoms terminating
each surface, the introduction of one oxygen va-
cancy gives a vacancy concentration of 25%; in a
previous DFT study of reduced ceria surfaces
[13], the same vacancy concentrations are found
in the (111) and (110) surfaces. The distances be-
tween defects in periodic cells are 7.74 A
 (111),
7.74 A
 (110) and 7.65 A
 (100). A larger surface
expansion would certainly reduce the vacancy con-
centration and provide larger defectdefect dis-
tances, however, the results presented below with
the present vacancy concentration are fully consis-
tent with experimental data and this gives confi-
dence in the surface models applied in the present
study. Smaller surface unit cell expansions, in
which O vacancies are adjacent, give rise to incor-
rect delocalisation of the defect, even with DFT +
U. The cut-offenergy for the plane wave basis is
500 eV and for sampling the Brillouin zone we
use a 2 · 2 · 1 Monkhorst Pack grid ((2 · 4 · 1)
for the (110) surface); sampling along the vector
separating the slabs is not required. Oxygen vacan-
cies are generated on both sides of the slab to
ensure that the slab has no net dipole.
3. Results
3.1. Geometry
We consider the structure of ceria surfaces after
formation of oxygen vacancies. The fully relaxed
atomic structures at the DFT + U level are dis-
played in Fig. 2. All reduced surfaces show distor-
tions about the vacancy site, which is labeled with
a V in Fig. 2(d)(f), the Ce4+ ions are the small
lightly shaded spheres in Fig. 2.
For reference, in the pure (111) surface, the Ce
O distances in the surface layer are 2.36 A
 . In the
defective surface, we remove a surface oxygen
atom, which was coordinated to 3 Ce atoms; the
position of the vacancy is indicated by the V
in Fig. 2(a). When the vacancy is formed, the three
226
M. Nolan et al. / Surface Science 595 (2005) 223232
Ce ions to which the oxygen was bonded are, by
symmetry, initially equivalent. Upon full relaxa-
tion of the geometry around the vacancy, we find
that this symmetry is broken; a distorted hexagon
is formed around the vacancy site, in which two Ce
ions are now equivalent (the large spheres in
Fig. 2(a) and (d) representing the Ce3+ ions see
Section 3.2). Thus, the symmetry present when
the oxygen atom is removed is broken during the
ionic relaxation. The resulting Ce3+ cations have
a larger ionic radius than the Ce4+ cation and this
is reflected in the CeO distances we observe
around the vacancy. There is a small lengthening
of around 0.03 A
 in the CeO bonds involving
the Ce3+ ions, while the two remaining CeO dis-
tances (involving the Ce4+ ion) are shortened by
0.1 A
 , due to the oxygen atoms moving away from
the Ce3+ ions. There is also a further, although
weaker, perturbation of the subsurface layer. This
surface is the least perturbed of the three low index
surfaces considered herein as expected, since this
surface is the most stable of the three low index
ceria surfaces studied.
In the pure (110), surface the CeO distances in
the surface layer are 2.34 A
 . In the defective (110)
surface, we have again removed one of the surface
coordinated oxygen atoms, whose position is indi-
cated with the V in Fig. 2(e). This leaves a sur-
face oxygen opposite the vacancy site, which is
bonded to the two Ce3+ ions. The distance be-
tween this oxygen atom and the Ce3+ atoms has
lengthened to 2.40 A
 , an elongation of 0.06 A
 ,
again attributable to the increased ionic radius of
the Ce3+ ion pushing the oxygen atom away; we
can also understand this lengthening as a reduc-
tion of the Coulomb interaction between the cat-

227
ion and the anion. The remaining CeO distances
in the surface layer show a contraction, with the
strongest contractions found for the CeO surface
bonds opposite the vacancy site (0.07 A
 ). The
strong distortions of the surface structure are car-
ried through to the first subsurface layer, where we
observe that the subsurface oxygen ions bonded to
the surface Ce3+ ions are strongly displaced in-
wards and slightly out of this subsurface plane
(Fig. 2(b)). The resulting Ce3+O distances are
elongated by 0.012 A
 , little changed compared to
the pure surface since these oxygen atoms have
moved out of the subsurface layer, so that the dis-
tance from these oxygen atoms to the third layer
Ce4+ atoms is elongated at 2.46 A
 . Thus, the dis-
tortions caused by formation of the oxygen va-
cancy in the surface propagate into the first
subsurface layer of this surface, but the structure
in subsequent layers is much less perturbed, as is
clear in Fig. 2(b).
Comparing the geometry of the defective (100)
surface to the geometry of the pure surface, we find
for the defective surface that the Ce3+O distances
neighbouring
the
vacancy
are
shortened
by
0.014 A
 to 2.176 A
 ; the Ce3+ ions move away from
the vacancy site. There is a lengthening of the
CeO distances in the first layer of Ce ions to the
subsurface oxygen ions; the distance is 2.520 A
 ,
compared to 2.450 A
 in the pure surfaces. Oppo-
site the vacancy site, there is a small lengthening
of the CeO distances so that they are either
2.227 A
 or 2.193 A
 ; the former CeO bonds are
found opposite the vacancy site and appear to be
quite strongly affected by the vacancy formation.
Comparison of these results can be made with
the available experimental surface data. The pres-
ent study considers single vacancies as a model for
the formation of defective surfaces in ceria. Iso-
lated point defects have been observed experimen-
tally
using
AFM
[8,9],
while
formation
of
aggregates of vacancies is also observed using
STM and AFM [79]. While these experimental
studies can provide information on general fea-
tures of the defective surfaces, they cannot provide
information on individual CeO distances, which
can however, be readily obtained from the DFT
results and are an important source of atomistic
and electronic level information on the effect of
defect formation on the surface structure. For
example, in [8,9], it was observed that upon va-
cancy formation, oxygen atoms are displaced away
from their lattice sites for the pure surface, consis-
tent with the present results, which can also pro-
vide details regarding the actual CeO distances
that result from vacancy formation.
3.2. Electronic structure
We now consider the electronic structure, for
which experimental data is available. In Fig. 3
we show the Ce 4f partial electronic density of
states (PEDOS) for the three defective surfaces.
Similar to experimental observations [46], we
observe a new gap state between the top of the
valence band (region I) in Fig. 3 and the unoccu-
pied Ce 4f band (region III in Fig. 3). The gap state
(region II in Fig. 3) is well separated from these
bands. This result is entirely consistent with experi-
mental data of Refs. [46] and is in contrast to the
description
obtained
with
GGA-DFT
[13,15].
With GGA, there is no gap state found between
the top of the valence band and the bottom of
the conduction band and the Fermi level crosses
the Ce 4f states, which are partially occupied and
a metallic state is found. To reiterate, these find-
ings from GGA-DFT [13,15] are inconsistent with
experimental data, e.g. UPS and conductivity
measurements.
The offset from the valence band to the gap
state is 1.10 eV for the (111) surface, 1.00 eV for
the (110) surface and 0.90 eV for the (100) sur-
face. These are to be compared with experimental
offsets of 1.2 eV for the reduced (111) surface [46]
and 2 eV for the reduced (110) surface [46]. The
energy gaps obtained with DFT are underesti-
mated, which is known to be a common issue with
DFT see e.g. [20]; however, experimental determi-
nation of band offsets is complicated by the fact
that in the UPS spectrum, this band, while being
distinct, is quite broad. For all surfaces, the new
gap state is due to formation of Ce3+ ions. The
question of localisation of these states will be trea-
ted in the following.
For all surfaces, the band gap of 5 eV from the
valence band to the Ce 5d conduction band found
in the pure surface [13] is essentially unchanged

defective (100) surface. In this figure, the PEDOS for region I is multiplied by 5 in order to allow the detailed PEDOS in this region to

upon formation of the vacancy. The band gap
from the valence band to the unoccupied Ce 4f
band is increased to 2.1 eV, compared to the same
value for the pure surface. The opening up of this
band gap is not unexpected, since the DFT + U
formalism is applied to the Ce 4f states and one
function of U is to shift up the energy of unoccu-
pied states, i.e. the unoccupied Ce 4f states. In
principle, this shift should be U/2, but in practice
a smaller shift is observed.
The nature of the gap state and the localisation
or otherwise of the Ce3+ ions is demonstrated
through analysis of the charge density of the gap
state (Fig. 4). We can also analyse the spin density,
which is defined as the difference in the up spin
electron density and the down spin electron den-
sity. However, the resulting spin density isosur-
faces are very similar to those of the charge
density of the gap state and in what follows, we
plot only the charge density isosurfaces. With
GGA-DFT, it has been demonstrated that the
charge and spin density for defective bulk and sur-
faces are delocalised over the Ce ions of the unit
cell [13,15]. The charge density for the gap state
from the DFT + U calculation is displayed in
Fig. 4 for the three defective surfaces. In all cases,
we observe localisation of charge at the two cerium
sites neighbouring the oxygen vacancy sites, show-
ing that the gap state found in the PEDOS arises
from formation of reduced Ce3+ ions (with an elec-
tronic configuration 4f1) which are directly neigh-
bouring the oxygen vacancy sites in the surface.
Again, these findings are consistent with experi-
mental results. In the (111) surface, the localisa-
tion of charge on two Ce3+ ions also shows the
symmetry breaking initially discussed in Section
3.1. A final feature of these plots is that the charge
density isosurface takes the form of an f-function,
which is what we expect since the occupied states
are due to occupation of Ce 4f states.
3.3. Vacancy formation energies
Finally, we consider the vacancy formation
energies, defined as the energy required for the
process: CeO2 ! CeO2x + 1/2O2, which we have
computed with DFT + U, since this approach pro-
vides a properly consistent description of surfaces
containing both Ce4+ and Ce3+. For the three
defective surfaces, Table 1 presents the DFT + U
formation energies per oxygen vacancy and the
formation energies computed with IPs from Ref.
[10]. In this table, we also display the relaxed sur-
face energies for the pure surfaces, denoted by
Epure
S
, with positive values. The surface energies
provide information on the stabilities of the sur-
facesthat with the lower surface energy is the
more stable surface. From Table 1 we see that,
of the three surfaces studied, the (111) surface is
the most stable, followed by (110) and (100). This

values for the isosurfaces are 0.16 electrons/A

ordering is in agreement with many other studies
and is discussed in more detail in Ref. [15].
For the calculation of the surface vacancy for-
mation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems
which contain Cethese species need to be de-
scribed by a consistent approachand GGA-
DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are
correctly described by GGA-DFT. The vacancy
formation energies reported in the second column
of Table 1 are affected by well known errors in the
binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT [21].
This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy for-
mation energies are thus underestimated. Compar-
ison of the present results with the experimental O2
binding energy [22] shows that this error results in
an increase in the vacancy formation energy of the
order of 0.70 eV. However, this error is surface
independent and hence does not affect the surface
dependence of the vacancy formation energies
and the discussion presented below. The third col-
umn of Table 1, includes the vacancy formation
energies corrected for this error.
It is generally taken to be the case that less
stable surfaces will be more favourable for the
formation of oxygen vacancies and thus more cat-
alytically active. For example, the IP calculations
of [10] showed that for the (111) and (110) sur-
faces considered, the less stable (110) surface has
a lower vacancy formation energy than the more
stable (111) surface. In the present work, we find
instead that the vacancy formation energies of
the low index surfaces do not follow the trend indi-
cated by the stabilities of the pure surfaces. Thus,
while the (111) surface is the most stable surface
and has the largest vacancy formation energy,
the vacancy formation energy is lowest on the
(110) surface rather than on the least stable
(100) surface, so that formation of surface vacan-
cies is most favourable on the (110) surface. The
stability of oxygen vacancies is thus not necessarily
determined by the stability of the pure surfaces.
The IP calculations give rise to similar results for
the (111) and (110) surfaces, although they did
not investigate the (100) surface and hence it is
not clear if IP calculations would give rise to the
same conclusions.
To investigate an origin for this result, we have
taken the surface structures in which the vacancy
has been formed and carried out an electronic
relaxation (without allowing the atomic positions
to relax). The ordering of the vacancy formation
energies follows that of the surface stability of
the pure surfaces. Upon comparison with the fully
relaxed surfaces, we find that the determining fac-
tor for the vacancy formation energies is therefore
atomic relaxation around the vacancy.
This finding regarding the vacancy formation
energy is of interest in the choice of surface for cat-
alytic applications, so that it will not be necessarily
the case that the most unstable perfect surface will
be the most catalytically active, and we are cur-
rently undertaking the study of the conversion of
CO to CO2 and NO2 to NO over ceria surfaces
[23]. These reactions will be expected to show
surface sensitivity and it will be of interest to
demonstrate the extent of this sensitivity using a
consistent theoretical approach.
4. Conclusions
The DFT + U formalism has been used to
study oxygen vacancy defects in the (111), (110)
and (100) surfaces of ceria, in order that a consis-
tent approach to describe the electronic structure
of both pure (CeO2; Ce4+) and defective (CeO2x;
Ce3+) ceria can be applied. There is no artificial
localisation of the Ce 4f states in the core for the

defective surfaces; it appears naturally in the
DFT + U description of the defective surfaces.
Full ionic relaxation of the defective surfaces
shows a strong perturbation of the CeO distances
in both surface and subsurface layers for all
surfaces. In agreement with experimental findings,
we observe a new gap state between the top of the
valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied Ce
4f band. The partial charge density of this gap
state and the excess spin density show localisation
of charge on the two cerium atoms neighbouring
the vacancy site (Ce3+, with 4f1 occupancy), in
agreement with experimental conclusions. This ap-
proach corrects the problems with GGA-DFT,
which predicts delocalisation of the partially occu-
pied 4f states and also removes any need to force
localisation onto the 4f states of Ce3+ by making
them part of the core. Most importantly we see
that the computation of oxygen vacancy formation
energies in the three surfaces with DFT + U leads
us to conclude that the vacancy formation energies
do not necessarily follow the stabilities of the pure
surfaces. Thus, the stability of defective ceria sur-
faces and the choice of surface for catalytic appli-
cations cannot necessarily be predicted a priori
from the stabilities of the pure surfaces.
The present work now allows us to obtain a
consistent description of the energetics of adsorp-
tion of small molecules such as CO and NO2
onto ceria surfaces, where defective surfaces play
a major role and also for the meaningful compu-
tation of the energetics of catalytic reactions
involving ceria surfaces and conversion of these
molecules.
