[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[4] "We observe an interesting result that the vacancy formation energies do not follow the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces, as measured by the surface energy; thus, the (110) surface has the lowest vacancy formation energy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the oxide surface provides oxygen to oxidize adsorbed molecules, creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

For ceria specifically, its oxygen storage capability (OSC) allows it to oxidize or reduce molecules depending on the reaction conditions. Ceria can oxidize a molecule by releasing oxygen atoms, which reduces the surface. Conversely, a reduced ceria surface can promote the reduction of a molecule by taking up an oxygen atom from that molecule.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the surface can more easily release oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. However, the relationship between ΔEv and surface stability is not straightforward. The study found that vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces. For example, the (110) surface of ceria has the lowest vacancy formation energy, despite not being the least stable surface.

This finding suggests that the catalytic activity of different ceria surfaces cannot be predicted solely based on the stability of the pure surfaces. The ease of oxygen vacancy formation, as indicated by ΔEv, plays a significant role in determining the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions and its overall catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机理中，氧化物表面提供氧来氧化吸附的分子，在表面上创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧重新填充，完成催化循环。

具体对于氧化铈而言，其氧储存能力（OSC）使其能够根据反应条件氧化或还原分子。氧化铈可以通过释放氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原表面。相反，还原的氧化铈表面可以通过从分子中吸收氧原子来促进分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面可以更容易地释放氧，可能导致更高的氧化反应催化活性。然而，ΔEv和表面稳定性之间的关系并不简单。研究发现，空位形成能量不一定遵循纯表面稳定性的顺序。例如，氧化铈的（110）表面具有最低的空位形成能，尽管它不是最不稳定的表面。

这一发现表明，不同氧化铈表面的催化活性不能仅基于纯表面的稳定性来预测。氧空位形成的容易程度（由ΔEv指示）在决定表面参与氧化反应的能力和其整体催化性能方面起着重要作用。
