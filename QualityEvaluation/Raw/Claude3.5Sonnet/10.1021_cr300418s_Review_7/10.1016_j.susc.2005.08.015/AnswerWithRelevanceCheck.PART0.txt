          [1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[4] "We observe an interesting result that the vacancy formation energies do not follow the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces, as measured by the surface energy; thus, the (110) surface has the lowest vacancy formation energy."

[5] "It is generally taken to be the case that less stable surfaces will be more favourable for the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active."

[6] "For the calculation of the surface vacancy formation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems which contain Ce—these species need to be described by a consistent approach—and GGA-DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are correctly described by GGA-DFT."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the catalyst surface is reduced as it provides oxygen to oxidize the reactant molecule, and is then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen. 

For ceria specifically, its oxygen storage capability (OSC) allows it to oxidize or reduce molecules depending on the reaction conditions. Ceria can oxidize a molecule by releasing oxygen atoms, which reduces the surface. Conversely, a reduced ceria surface can promote the reduction of a molecule by taking up an oxygen atom from that molecule.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Generally, surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are considered more favorable for forming oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active. This is because a lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, making it more readily available for oxidation reactions.

However, the study shows that the relationship between surface stability, vacancy formation energy, and catalytic activity is not always straightforward. The vacancy formation energies of different ceria surfaces do not necessarily follow the trend indicated by the stabilities of the pure surfaces. For example, the (110) surface of ceria has the lowest vacancy formation energy, despite not being the least stable surface.

This finding suggests that the catalytic activity of different ceria surfaces cannot be predicted solely based on the stability of the pure surfaces. The ease of oxygen vacancy formation, as indicated by ΔEv, plays a significant role in determining the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions and its overall catalytic performance.

The ability to accurately calculate ΔEv is crucial for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior. The study employs advanced computational methods (DFT+U) to obtain consistent and accurate descriptions of both pure and defective ceria surfaces, which is essential for meaningful computation of catalytic reaction energetics involving these surfaces.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。在这种机制中，催化剂表面通过提供氧来氧化反应分子而被还原，然后被气相氧重新氧化。

具体对于氧化铈而言，其氧储存能力（OSC）使其能够根据反应条件氧化或还原分子。氧化铈可以通过释放氧原子来氧化分子，从而还原表面。相反，还原的氧化铈表面可以通过从分子中吸收氧原子来促进分子的还原。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。通常，具有较低空位形成能的表面被认为更有利于形成氧空位，因此催化活性更高。这是因为较低的ΔEv表明从表面去除氧更容易，使其更容易参与氧化反应。

然而，研究表明，表面稳定性、空位形成能和催化活性之间的关系并不总是简单直接的。不同氧化铈表面的空位形成能并不一定遵循纯表面稳定性所指示的趋势。例如，氧化铈的（110）表面具有最低的空位形成能，尽管它不是最不稳定的表面。

这一发现表明，不同氧化铈表面的催化活性不能仅基于纯表面的稳定性来预测。氧空位形成的容易程度（由ΔEv指示）在决定表面参与氧化反应的能力和其整体催化性能方面起着重要作用。

准确计算ΔEv的能力对于理解和预测催化行为至关重要。该研究采用先进的计算方法（DFT+U）来获得纯净和缺陷氧化铈表面的一致和准确描述，这对于有意义地计算涉及这些表面的催化反应能量至关重要。
