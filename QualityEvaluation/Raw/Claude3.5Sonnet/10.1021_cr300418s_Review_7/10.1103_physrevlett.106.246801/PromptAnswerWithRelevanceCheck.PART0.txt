[1] "Ceria is a widely used oxide support for several oxidation reactions, such as the water-gas shift and NOx reduction [1–3]. The outstanding performance of ceria in promoting oxidation processes relies to a large extent on its facile reducibility and the associated ability to release lattice oxygen [4]."

[2] "The vacancies are easily healed again in an O-rich ambience, which makes the oxide perfectly suited to balance the oxygen supply during a catalytic reaction."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the release of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy from the gas phase. Ceria exemplifies this process due to its facile reducibility and ability to release and replenish lattice oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier release of lattice oxygen, potentially increasing catalytic activity. However, it also implies weaker binding of oxygen to the surface, which may reduce the oxide's oxidizing power. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger oxygen binding and potentially greater oxidizing ability, but may limit the release of lattice oxygen and thus catalytic activity.

In ceria, the balance between these factors contributes to its effectiveness in oxidation reactions. Its ability to easily form and heal oxygen vacancies allows it to balance oxygen supply during catalytic reactions, making it an excellent support for various oxidation processes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及从氧化物表面释放晶格氧以氧化反应物，然后从气相中补充氧空位。氧化铈很好地例证了这一过程，因为它具有容易还原性和释放及补充晶格氧的能力。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv促进晶格氧的更容易释放，可能增加催化活性。然而，这也意味着氧与表面的结合较弱，可能降低氧化物的氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧结合更强，可能具有更大的氧化能力，但可能限制晶格氧的释放，从而限制催化活性。

在氧化铈中，这些因素之间的平衡有助于其在氧化反应中的有效性。它容易形成和修复氧空位的能力使其能够在催化反应过程中平衡氧供应，使其成为各种氧化过程的优秀支持材料。
