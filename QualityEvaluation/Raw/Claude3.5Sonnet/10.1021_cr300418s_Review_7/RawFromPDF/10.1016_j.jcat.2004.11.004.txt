Abstract
The crystal plane of ceria plays an essential role in determining its catalytic oxidation properties. In this study, single-crystalline CeO2
nanorods with well-deﬁned crystal planes have been synthesized by a facile solution-based hydrothermal method. HRTEM studies reveal
that the predominantly exposed planes are the unusually reactive {001} and {110} in the CeO2 nanorods rather than the stable {111} in the
irregular nanoparticles. Consequently, it is demonstrated that the CeO2 nanorods are more reactive for CO oxidation than their counterparts,
irregular nanoparticles. The present results indicate that catalysts with well-deﬁned reactive sites may be “designed” because of the recent
development of morphology-controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials.

1. Introduction
Designing and synthesizing a highly reactive/selective
catalyst has been an intriguing and challenging goal in het-
erogeneous catalysis [1–3]. So far high-surface-area inor-
ganic oxides are of interest because they exhibit numer-
ous edges and corners for adsorption and activation of re-
actants [4,5]. However, these materials, which are usually
composed of assorted polycrystals with different exposed
crystal planes, possess several kinds of active sites, which
exhibit different reactivities and usually lower activity. On
the other hand, catalysts with well-deﬁned reactive crystal
planes have been the focus of interest because they have
desirable properties [6–10]. A typical case may be iron cat-
alysts used for the synthesis of ammonia. It was observed
that preferentially exposed {111} planes at the surface of
iron are crucial to generating excellent activity [7,8]. For
methanol oxidation, the Pt{111}/Ru electrode was found

to be the best fuel-cell anode [9]. Recently, Choudary et
al. reported that MgO hexagonal crystals exposing the most
{100} planes were more active than nanocrystalline sam-
ples [10].
Therefore, a desirable goal for catalyst design and syn-
thesis would be to decrease the less reactive crystal planes
and increase the more reactive ones so as to optimize the de-
sired structure of the active sites. However, this has turned
out to be a very difﬁcult task for most of the practical cata-
lysts [1–3,6]. Although large single-crystal model catalysts
are characteristic of these features, the surface area of the
“effective” planes is very small and far from practical appli-
cation. Morphology-controlled synthesis of nanostructured
materials, such as single-crystalline one-dimensional (1D)
nanomaterials (wires, rods, belts, and tubes), may present an
opportunity for the synthesis of catalytic materials with such
desirable features because these novel materials nucleate and
grow in an epitaxial manner, exposing deﬁned crystal planes
[11–13]. Moreover, they are usually synthesized under un-
usual conditions, and some reactive crystal planes may be
obtained.

Ceria (CeO2) has been extensively investigated in hetero-
geneous catalysis [14–16], especially as an oxygen buffer in
three-way catalysts [17]. For this application, reactive ce-
ria is needed. Unfortunately, numbers of previous studies
have shown that ceria nanoparticles predominantly expose
their least reactive {111} planes, and the generation of more
reactive planes with deﬁned structures is very difﬁcult by
conventional methods [18–25]. Recently, through an easy
solution-based hydrothermal method, we synthesized most
of the rare earth compounds with 1D morphology [11]. This
indicates that fabrication of 1D nanostructures of CeO2 may
also be possible. Here the hydrothermal method was suc-
cessfully used to synthesize CeO2 nanorods, which are well-
deﬁned single-crystalline 1D nanostructures. An enhanced
catalytic activity has been found for CO oxidation over CeO2
nanorods compared with CeO2 nanoparticles with high spe-
ciﬁc surface area.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of CeO2 nanorods and CeO2 nanoparticles
CeO2 nanorods can be synthesized by a solution-based
hydrothermal method as follows. Ce(NO3)3 · 6H2O (1.5 g)
was dissolved in distilled water, and proper amounts of 10%
NaOH solution were rapidly added with stirring at about
200 rpm. A light yellow precipitate of amorphous CeO2 ap-
peared. After about 15 min of stirring, all of the slurry (the
volume was about 35 ml) was then transferred into a 50-ml
autoclave, which was ﬁlled with deionized water up to 80%
of the total volume (the ﬁnal NaOH concentration in the
autoclave is about 2 M), and heated at 100 ◦C under auto-
genous pressure for 10 h. The system was then allowed to
cool to room temperature. The ﬁnal product was collected by
ﬁltration, washed with deionized water to remove any pos-
sible ionic remnants, and then dried at 60 ◦C and calcined at
350 ◦C for 4 h. CeO2 nanoparticles were prepared by a tradi-
tional precipitation method: Ce(NO3)3 ·6H2O was dissolved
in distilled water, and then the pH value of the solution was
rapidly adjusted to 12 with 10% NaOH solution with stir-
ring. The precipitate was ﬁltrated, washed with deionized
water, dried at 60 ◦C for 24 h, and then calcined at 350 ◦C
for 4 h.
2.2. Catalytic activity evaluation
The catalytic activities for CO oxidation were evaluated
in a ﬁxed-bed quartz tubular reactor. The catalyst particles
(0.2 g) were placed in the reactor. The reactant gases (1.0%
CO, 16% O2, balanced with nitrogen) went through the
reactor at a rate of 100 ml/min. The composition of the
gas exiting the reactor was monitored by gas chromatogra-
phy.
2.3. Materials characterization
Powder XRD was performed with a Bruker D8 Advance
X-ray diffractometer with monochromatized Cu-Kα radia-
tion (λ = 1.5418 Å). The size and morphology of all of
the materials were measured with a Hitachi H-800 trans-
mission electron microscope and a JEOL JEM-2010F high-
resolution transmission electron microscope. XPS measure-
ments were conducted with a VG ESCA LAB 220 i-XL
system with Al-Kα radiation under UHV (5 × 10−9 Pa), cal-
ibrated internally by carbon deposit C (1s) binding energy
(BE) at 284.6 eV. The BET surface area of catalysts was
measured by N2 adsorption with the single-point method.
Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was
conducted with a conventional apparatus equipped with a
TCD detector. Before the TPR analysis, the samples were
treated in pure oxygen at 450 ◦C for 45 min. A molecular
sieve trap was placed before the detector to adsorb the wa-
ter produced. TPR was performed by heating of the sample
(50 mg) at 10 ◦C/min to 950 ◦C in a 5% H2–N2 mixture
ﬂowing at 40 ml/min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. TEM, XRD, XPS, and BET analysis of CeO2 nanorods
and CeO2 nanoparticles
The as-obtained CeO2 nanorods were 100–300 nm in
length and about 13–20 nm in diameter (Fig. 1(a)). On the
other hand, the CeO2 nanoparticles exhibit irregular shapes;
their agglomeration can be observed (Fig. 1(b)), and the
mean size is about 8 nm, as calculated from Scherrer’s equa-
tion. Powder XRD analysis (Fig. 2) shows that both CeO2
nanorods and nanoparticles can be indexed to the pure ﬂuo-
rite cubic structures (space group Fm3m (225)) with a lattice
constant a = 5.411 Å (JCPDS 34-0394). XPS analysis re-
veals that only Ce4+ can be detected, and the surface compo-
sition and the chemical states of Ce are essentially the same
for the two samples (the XPS patterns are not shown here).
The BET surface area of the as-prepared CeO2 nanorods is
50.1 m2/g, and that of the CeO2 nanoparticles is 62.4 m2/g.
3.2. TPR analysis of CeO2 nanorods and CeO2
nanoparticles
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) by H2 has
been used extensively in the literature to characterize the
surface and bulk oxygen reducibility of ceria materials. As
suggested by Terribile et al. [4], the real redox property of
CeO2 can be measured indirectly by TPR followed by reoxi-
dation. Therefore, we interrupted the ﬁrst TPR run at 650 ◦C
when the low-temperature reduction process was completed,
then the samples were reoxidized with pure O2 at 450 ◦C,
and a second TPR run was performed.
The TPR results of the ﬁrst runs (Fig. 3) showed that
both CeO2 nanoparticles and CeO2 nanorods exhibited

a broad reduction proﬁle centered around 500 ◦C and a
high-temperature reduction peak above 700 ◦C. Quantita-
tive evaluation of the low-temperature reduction peak (be-
low 650 ◦C) indicated that hydrogen consumed by CeO2
nanoparticles (153 µmolH2/g of sample) was about three
times larger than that consumed by CeO2
nanorods
(52 µmolH2/g of sample), indicating a greater amount of
surface oxygen on the CeO2 nanoparticles.
However, the second TPR runs (Fig. 4) showed that al-
most 80% of the surface oxygen on the CeO2 nanoparticles

was lost after cycling (the remnant was only 30.5 µmolH2/g).
Meanwhile, promotion of Ce4+ reduction was observed on
CeO2 nanorods (60.4 µmolH2/g), revealing a stable facile
Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle. Loss of the low-temperature redox prop-
erty of conventionally prepared CeO2 nanoparticles was also
observed by Terribile et al. [4]. The surface area of CeO2
nanoparticles before the second TPR run was 52.6 m2/g.
Although the surface area was found to decrease by about
15.7%, this could not fully account for the severe loss of the
redox property. A possible explanation for this may be the
changes in ceria structure of some very ﬁne clusters, as sug-
gested by Putna and Cordatos et al. [26,27]. Simulated an-
nealing calculations for small ceria clusters [27] demonstrate
that the structure and reducibility of ionic clusters should de-
pend strongly on the cluster size. The overall trend is for the
larger particles to be more difﬁcult to reduce. HRTEM analy-
sis (in Section 3.4) in the present study shows that there were
also some amorphous ceria clusters in the fresh nanoparti-
cles; thus a higher reducibility was observed during the ﬁrst
TPR run. However, these ﬁne ceria clusters might be very
sensitive to the reducing atmosphere and structural changes
might occur, resulting in lower reducibility during the sec-
ond TPR run.
It is generally accepted that the low-temperature reduc-
tion process is a reduction of the surface oxygen species,
which are catalytically active for CO oxidation [25]. There-
fore, the relatively stable redox property of CeO2 nanorods
implies they may be more active than the traditional nanopar-
ticles.
3.3. CO catalytic oxidation over CeO2 nanorods and CeO2
nanoparticles
CO oxidation is an important process in three-way catal-
ysis. Measurements were made of the catalytic activity, the
results are shown in Fig. 5. It is clear that CeO2 nanorods
are more active than CeO2 nanoparticles. At 190 ◦C, the per-

centage CO conversion is 40% over CeO2 nanorods and only
17% over nanoparticles; the corresponding rates of conver-
sion of CO are 2.03 and 0.66 µmol/(gs), respectively. The
rate of conversion over CeO2 nanorods is therefore three
times higher than that over nanoparticles.
We also observed a remarkable stability of the CeO2
nanorods against calcination. Even after calcined in air at
600 ◦C for 4 h, the morphology of the nanorods remained
unchanged and the activity decreased slightly. On the other
hand, the particle size of irregular nanoparticles increased
with calcination temperature and the catalytic performance
decreased sharply. Table 1 summarizes the light-off temper-
atures T50, corresponding to 50% conversion of CO. All of
these data show the ceria nanorods are really more active
than the “classical” ceria nanoparticles.
In general, high-surface-area nanocatalytic materials ex-
hibiting numerous crystal faces, edges, and corners, which
are conventionally considered active sites for the adsorption
of reactants [4,5,28], should generate better catalytic perfor-
mance. However, in the present study CeO2 nanoparticles,
with higher surface area and smaller particle size, are poorer
catalysts, whereas CeO2 nanorods, with lower surface area
and larger diameter, are more active and demonstrate a sta-
ble redox property. These unusual results for these two ceria
nanomaterials inspire us to hope that speciﬁc crystal planes
are indeed a determining factor that will prove useful.
3.4. HRTEM analysis of CeO2 nanorods and CeO2
nanoparticles
It is well known that there are three low-index planes in
the ceria ﬂuorite cubic structure, namely the very stable and
neutral {111} plane, the less stable {110} plane, and the
higher-energy {001} plane [22]. Previous computer simu-
lations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen
vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The
stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or
{110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive [19–21]. Re-
cently, using a projector-augmented wave (PAW) method
based on density-functional theory, Yang et al. [29] found
that there are different adsorption features for CO on {111}
and {110} planes. Whereas only weak adsorptions are found
on the {111} plane, there are both weak and strong adsorp-
tions on the {110} plane. If exposed planes with higher sur-
face energy could be generated and stabilized, they could
provide active sites for catalytic reactions.

Obviously, it may help to recall the morphology of these
ceria materials. Figure 6(a) shows a HRTEM image of the
CeO2 nanoparticles. The dominant lattice fringes are from
{111}, which are observed when the particles are oriented
along the [110] direction. The particles show two types
of shapes: one is the octahedral, enclosed by eight {111}
planes, and the other is the truncated octahedral, enclosed
by eight {111} and six {001} planes [22,23]. Obviously, the
predominantly exposed planes are the {111} in the CeO2
nanoparticles, with a small amount of {001} planes. Com-
bined with previous studies [22,23], the structural models of
these nanoparticles are drawn in Fig. 6(b).

of the octahedral and truncated octahedral shapes of CeO2 nanoparticles.
In the case of the CeO2 nanorods, cross-sectional views
are necessary to identify all of the side planes. The cross-
sectional TEM image of the CeO2 nanorods is shown
in Fig. 7(a). The cutting method used here is the well-
established microtome technique widely used in the prepa-
ration of microscope samples, especially of biological spec-
imens. The image clearly presents their rectangular cross
section, indicating that each nanorod has four side surfaces.
Figure 7(b) shows a HRTEM image of one typical CeO2
nanorod. The upper right inset shows a selected area elec-
tron diffraction (SAED) pattern from the individual nanorod
with a [001] zone axis. The inset on the lower right shows a
magniﬁed view of the selected area of the nanorod. Both in-
sets indicate that the as-prepared CeO2 nanorods are single-
crystalline and the preferential growth direction is [110].
Figure 8(a) shows a two-dimensional crystal lattice im-
age of one typical nanorod with a growth axis perpendic-
ular to the electron beam. The SAED pattern (Fig. 8(b))
indicates the view direction is [001]. Based on the interpla-
nar spacings, plane-intersecting angles, and the rectangular
cross section, two sets of {002} planes and two {110} side
planes of the rod can be identiﬁed. Another HRTEM image
view along [1–10] is shown in Fig. 8 (c). Here one set of
{001} planes and two {001} side planes of the rod are iden-
tiﬁed. On the basis of the above images, the four side planes
of the nanorods are deﬁned to be two {001} and two {110}
planes. The structural models of these nanorods are drawn in
Fig. 8(e).
The above HRTEM results reveal that CeO2 nanorods
predominantly expose the well-deﬁned and less stable {001}
and {110} planes, whereas in the CeO2 nanoparticles the
most stable {111} planes are predominantly exposed. And
the activity data show that the ceria nanorods are more ac-
tive than the “classical” ceria nanoparticles
In the course of the reaction, –Ce4+–O– is attacked and
reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then

O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen
atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 mole-
cule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of
highly reactive atomic oxygen [30,31]. In the case of CeO2
nanorods, the more reactive planes are exposed. Moreover,
the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indi-
cates the reactive planes can be well protected. Thus a stable
Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate bet-
ter catalytic performance during reaction. On the other hand,
because of the predominant {111} planes, the real redox
property of the CeO2 nanoparticles is poorer than that of the
nanorods, resulting in a lower activity. According to these
results, a correlation can be drawn between the catalytic
performance and the crystal planes: CeO2 nanorods, with
well-deﬁned reactive planes ({001} and {110}), are more
active than “classical” ceria nanoparticles with the {111}
planes.
4. Conclusions
In summary, CeO2 nanorods with well-deﬁned reactive
planes ({001} and {110}) can be synthesized by an easy
solution-based hydrothermal method. These nanorods show
higher CO oxidation activity than CeO2 nanoparticles be-
cause of their more reactive planes. The present results
suggest that catalysts may be “designed” rather than “pre-
pared” because of the recent development of morphology-
controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials. Through
the control of a few critical synthesis parameters, nanoma-
terials with predictable morphologies, namely well-deﬁned
crystal planes, can be obtained, and the use of these materi-
als as model catalysts in laboratory investigations as well as
practical applications becomes possible.
