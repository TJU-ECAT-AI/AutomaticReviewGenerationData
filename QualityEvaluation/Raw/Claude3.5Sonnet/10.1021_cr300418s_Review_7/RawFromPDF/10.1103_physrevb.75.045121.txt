We report periodic density functional theory DFT calculations for CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the Perdew-
Burke-Ernzerhof PBE0 and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE hybrid functionals that include nonlocal Fock
exchange. We study structural, electronic, and magnetic ground state properties. Hybrid functionals correctly
predict Ce2O3 to be an insulator as opposed to the ferromagnetic metal predicted by the local spin density
LDA and generalized gradient GGA approximations. The equilibrium volumes of both structures are in
very good agreement with experiments, improving upon the description of the LDA and GGA. The calculated
CeO2 O 2p–Ce 5d and Ce2O3 Ce 4f-5d4f band gaps are larger by up to 45% PBE0 and 15% HSE than
found in experiments. Furthermore, we calculate atomization energies, heats of formation, and the reduction
energy of 2CeO2→Ce2O3+1/2O2. The latter is underestimated by 0.4–0.9 eV with respect to available
experimental data at room temperature. We compare our results with the more traditional DFTU LDA+U
and PBE+U approach and discuss the role played by the Hubbard U parameter.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cerium oxides CeO2−x, 0x1/2 are interesting com-
pounds with important applications in industrial catalysis,
e.g., in automotive catalytic converters to decrease pollutants
from combustion exhausts.1 They are believed to be key ma-
terials in the future hydrogen production technology,2,3 in
particular for the water-gas-shift reaction and the conversion
of ethanol and ethanol-water mixtures into dihydrogen. The
beneﬁcial role of cerium oxides in catalysis has been mainly
attributed to their oxygen storage capacity, i.e., their ability
to easily take up and release oxygen under oxidizing and
reducing conditions, respectively.1,4,5 Thus, having a theoret-
ical approach that is able to describe the changes in the oxi-
dation state of the multivalent cerium atoms appears desir-
able. In terms of the electronic structure, partially reduced
ceria represents an intermediate case between CeO2 and
Ce2O3, on which the present work focuses.
The quantitive prediction of the chemical and physical
properties of systems containing multivalent metals, in par-
ticular lanthanide species, requires an accurate description of
the f states and has been a challenge to density functional
theory DFT calculations. The local density LDA and gen-
eralized gradient GGA approximations to the exchange-
correlation XC energy functional often yield a qualitatively
incorrect behavior for the case in which the f-orbital over-
laps are small, the bands narrow, and the electrons nearly
localize.6 In Ce2O3, the cerium atoms are in a trivalent con-
ﬁguration 4f1, the 4f orbital localizes, and the material
behaves like a typical antiferromagnetic AF Mott-Hubbard
insulator.7,8 The dioxide, on the other hand, is an insulator
and the Ce atoms are tetravalent 4f0.9 Existing ﬁrst-
principles calculations10–13 have been only partly successful
in providing a uniﬁed description of the ground state prop-
erties of both cerium oxides.
Two different approximations for modeling the Ce2O3 and
CeO2 oxides are often adopted in DFT. The Ce 4f states are
treated either as part of the core or explicitly as valence
states. The former approach describes Ce2O3 as an insulator
by construction, but it is not applicable to CeO2. The ap-
proach that treats the Ce 4f states as valence states resulted
in the expected insulating ground state for CeO2, but a fer-
romagnetic FM metallic ground state for Ce2O3. A likely
reason for this failure is the incomplete cancellation of the
Coulomb self-interaction in the density functionals used,
which stabilizes delocalized solutions. As a result, the elec-
tronic structure of magnetic materials with strongly localized
electrons is generally not correctly reproduced.14,15
Pragmatic approaches that have been developed to over-
come the limitations of the LDA and GGA functionals, such
as
the
self-interaction
correction16
and
the
DFT+U
approach,6 have been recently applied to cerium oxides. 11,17
But subtle details of the actual implementation can strongly
inﬂuence the results. For DFT+U, the band gaps and the
energetics depend on the Hubbard U parameter, the choice of
the
localized
orbitals,
and
the
underlying
exchange-
correlation functional LDA or GGA.
A different possibility to reduce the improper self-
interaction is the use of hybrid functionals in which a ﬁxed
amount of nonlocal Fock exchange is added to local LDA
or semilocal GGA XC functionals. Despite the important
impact of hybrid functionals in molecular quantum chemis-
try, B3LYP in particular,18 their applications to periodic sol-
ids used to be linked to Gaussian basis sets.15,19–24 The rea-
son is the large computational effort to evaluate the nonlocal
Fock exchange in extended periodic systems using a plane-
wave basis set. Due to the progress in plane-wave-based

algorithms25,26 and computer speed, hybrid functionals such
as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof27,28 HSE and the Perdew-
Burke Ernzerhof29–31 PBE0 functionals have been recently
implemented in widely used plane-wave basis set codes.32–34
In this work, we report a hybrid functional study of bulk
CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the PBE0 and HSE hybrid functionals
within the framework of the plane-wave projector augmented
wave PAW formalism,35–37 and compare with the LDA, the
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof GGA from now on referred
to as PBE, LDA+U, and PBE+U descriptions of these sys-
tems. We calculate the ground state structural, electronic, and
magnetic properties as well as atomization energies and heats
of formation. We also present results for the reduction energy
of 2CeO2→Ce2O3+ 1
2O2. Selected PBE calculations were
performed using the full-potential linearized augmented
plane-wave plus local orbitals FPL/APW+LO method.38
II. THEORETICAL APPROACH AND COMPUTATIONAL
DETAILS
Spin-polarized calculations were performed using differ-
ent XC energy functionals. The hybrid PBE0 Refs. 29–31
and HSE Refs. 27 and 28 functionals were used. In both
cases 75% of the well-known PBE exchange39 is combined
with 25% of the nonlocal Fock exchange, and the correlation
functional corresponds to that in the PBE functional. The
HSE and PBE0 functionals differ in the treatment of the
long-range part of the Fock exchange interaction with the
former being computationally advantageous. The HSE func-
tional cuts off the long-range tail of the Coloumb 1/r kernel
using the complementary error function, allowing for a
coarse k-point sampling of the nonlocal exchange kernel.33
Since this cutoff also slightly reduces the formally 25%
Fock exchange experienced by the electrons, the HSE and
PBE0 functionals give similar, but not identical, descriptions
for solid state systems. Generally band gaps tend to be
slightly smaller using the HSE functional, whereas the ener-
getics are very similar for both functionals.33 We note that
the use of 25% nonlocal Fock exchange has been justiﬁed
using
the
adiabatic-connection
ﬂuctuation
dissipation
theorem,29 and there is ample evidence that this value gives
accurate results for a large class of materials, including
metals.28,33 In the present case, the parameter  in the HSE
functional was set to 0.3 Å=0.158 a.u. for both the local
density part as well as the nonlocal Fock part. These are the
parameters originally suggested for the HSE03 functional,
but differ from those actually applied in Refs. 27 and 28 see
also Ref. 40.
The LDA Ref. 41 and PBE Ref. 39 functionals were
also employed. Furthermore, a Hubbard U term was added to
the plain LDA and PBE functionals6 LDA+U and PBE+U
employing the rotationally invariant approach proposed by
Dudarev et al.,42 in which only the difference Ueff=U−J
between the Coulomb U and exchange J parameters enters.
Values of Ueff=5.30 and 4.50 eV were used in the LDA+U
and PBE+U calculations, respectively, which were calculated
self-consistently by Fabris et al.13 using the linear-response
approach of Cococcioni and de Gironcoli.43
The Kohn-Sham equations were solved using the projec-
tor augmented wave method,35–37 as implemented in the Vi-
enna ab initio simulation package VASP.44,45 The calcula-
tions use a yet unreleased version, which includes the
nonspherical one-center contributions to the PBE potential
and hybrid functionals. For comparison, selected PBE calcu-
lations were made using another full-potential approach,
namely, the full-potential L/APW+LO method38 as imple-
mented in the WIEN2k program,46,47 which is a combination
of the linearized augmented plane-wave method48 and the
augmented plane-wave plus local orbitals method.49
In the PAW method, the interaction between the ions and
electrons is described by the standard frozen-core potentials
provided within the VASP package, which were generated ac-
cording to the procedure outlined in Ref. 36. We treated the
Ce 4f ,5s,5p,5d,6s and O 2s,2p electrons as valence
states, while the remaining electrons were kept frozen as core
states. A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV was used. The
augmentation charges were evaluated using an additional
grid, which contained eight times more points than the grid
for the wave functions determined from the cutoff energy.
The projection operators were evaluated in reciprocal space.
In the mixed L/APW+LO method, the L/APW+LO wave
functions inside the atomic spheres with radius of 1.16 and
0.74 Å for Ce and O atoms, respectively, are composed by a
combination of APW+LO basis functions l=0,1,2,3 for Ce
and l=0,1 for O and LAPW basis functions for all higher
angular momenta up to 12. Furthermore, local orbitals were
set to speciﬁcally treat the Ce 5s, 5p, and 5d orbitals, as well
as the O 2s orbital. The L/APW+LO wave functions in the
interstitial region were represented using plane waves with
kinetic energy up to 250 eV, whereas for the potential rep-
resentation in the interstitial region, plane waves with kinetic
energy up to 3500 eV were considered. Inside of the atomic
spheres, the representation of the potential considered terms
with angular momentum up to 6. Furthermore, nonspherical
matrix Hamiltonian elements are considered up to l=6.
The Brillouin-zone integrations were performed using
Monkhorst-Pack grids.50 The hybrid calculations were car-
ried out using a 666 mesh for both systems, whereas
for the remaining calculations, 101010 and 1010
5 meshes were employed for CeO2 and Ce2O3, respec-
tively. We note that the hybrid functional calculations are
converging rapidly with the k-point grid, since both systems
become wide band gap insulators. Thus results using a
666 mesh are virtually identical to those obtained us-
ing a 444 grid.

seven-fold coordinated with experimental Ce-O bond lengths
of 32.34, 12.43, and 32.69 Å,8,55 while two of the O
atoms are four-fold coordinated and the third O atom is six-

fold coordinated. All atomic positions in the ﬂuorite-type
structure are fully constrained by the space group symmetry,
while in the hexagonal structure there are two free internal
parameters uCe,uO in addition to the two lattice constants
a0,c0.
The LDA, PBE, LDA+U, PBE+U, PBE0, and HSE equi-
librium volumes V0 were calculated by minimizing the stress
tensor and all internal degrees of freedom. To avoid prob-
lems resulting from the basis set change upon changing the
volume Pulay stress, the cutoff energy was increased to
800 eV LDA, PBE, LDA+U, and PBE+U or a uniform
correction to the stress tensor was applied PBE0 and HSE.
The bulk moduli B0 were obtained by ﬁtting the calculated
total ground state energies for selected relaxed structures
with ﬁxed volumes to Murnaghan’s equation of state.56 The
high computational cost of the hybrid computations pre-
cluded energy minimization at various volumes; hence no
bulk moduli are reported for the hybrid functionals. In Tables
I and II our calculated bulk properties are compared to avail-
able experimental data.
The hybrid PBE0 and HSE functionals yield the same
equilibrium volume V0=a0
3/4 for CeO2, which is underes-
timated by only 1.1% compared to the experimental
volume.51,52,54 For Ce2O3, the equilibrium volume V0
=3a0
2c0/2 of the AF spin conﬁguration is also underesti-
mated by about 1% in the PBE0 and HSE calculations com-
pared to the experimental volume.55 The general agreement
between the lattice constants of both oxides and experiment
is very satisfactory. Our hybrid functional results are in line
with the tendency of hybrid functional calculations to under-
estimate equilibrium volumes recently observed for selected
metallic, semiconducting, and simple oxide systems.28,33
The LDA and PBE results for CeO2 reﬂect the expected
underestimation by 2.2% and overestimation by 3.3% of
the equilibrium volume, respectively, which are characteris-
tics of these functionals see, e.g., Refs. 57 and 58. The
agreement between the PAW and the FP-L/APW+LO calcu-
lations is excellent, both for the lattice constants, as well as
for the bulk moduli, and the comparison to experiment is
fairly decent. The combination of overestimated equilibrium
volumes and underestimated bulk moduli, typical of PBE,
can be seen as well in Table I.
Yet, in contrast to CeO2, the equilibrium volumes ob-
tained for Ce2O3 using the LDA and PBE are far from being
satisfactory. Both LDA and PBE underestimate V0 by 8.9%
and 2.7%, respectively. We note that our LDA and PBE re-
sults for both the equilibrium lattice constants and the bulk
modulus are in good agreement with most of the previous
ﬁrst-principles calculations.10,11,13,59,60
Thus, the PBE0 and HSE results are in much better agree-
ment with experiment than the LDA and PBE ones. The
improvement of the hybrid calculations over local and
semilocal functionals goes beyond the lattice constants as
discussed in the next section. The improvement is particu-
larly noticeable for the Ce2O3 case. For the hybrid function-
als, the equilibrium volume usually lies in between the LDA
and GGA values, but for Ce2O3 the volume increases from
the GGA to HSE and PBE0 results. As shown below, a single
electron localizes in a Ce 4f state per Ce atom for the hybrid
functionals, effectively removing any hybridization with the
conduction and valence bands. In the local and semilocal
functionals, the Ce 4f states below the Fermi level are delo-
calized and show spurious bonding interactions with the oxy-
gen 2p states leading to a much too small equilibrium vol-
ume. This is a ﬁrst hint that the description of the bonding
properties is much improved using the hybrid functionals.
For the DFT+U case, the calculated CeO2 and Ce2O3
equilibrium volumes depend signiﬁcantly on the description
of the standard DFT part LDA versus PBE. The LDA+U
scheme underestimates V0 by 0.6% and 3.2% for CeO2 and
Ce2O3, respectively, whereas, the corresponding PBE+U vol-
umes deviate by +4.5% and +3.6%. Hence the inclusion of U
in either LDA or PBE changes the volume only little for
CeO2 by up to +2%, but strongly increases the volume of
Ce2O3 +6%. This is similar to the hybrid functionals and
suggests that the LDA+U approach gives a reasonable ac-
count of the electron localization. It is noteworthy that the
LDA+U values appear to be closer to experiment and the
hybrid approaches than the PBE+U results. A recent publi-
cation of Fabris et al.61 also indicated a better performance
of LDA+U than PBE+U for the description of reduced ceria
surfaces.
As usual, the volume V0 depends on the parameter Ueff, as
shown in Fig. 2. The results were obtained by minimizing the

increase almost linearly with Ueff for both cerium oxides.
The slope of the curve is signiﬁcantly steeper for Ce2O3
note the different scale. Only the LDA+U curves approach
or intersect the experimental line at a value of roughly Ueff
=8.0 eV. This value is, however, larger than the effective
Ueff determined by perturbation theory 5.30 eV,13 and its
use would worsen other materials properties, in particular,
formation energies see below.
B. Electronic structure
Although optical properties and band gaps are not ground
state properties, it has become a common practice to com-
pare DFT one-electron energies with experimentally mea-
sured quasiparticle spectra. In Fig. 3, we present results for
the CeO2 and Ce2O3 spin-projected total and local density of
states DOS. In CeO2, all valence Ce states, including the 4f
states, are empty and the system is a wide gap insulator with
a measured fundamental band gap62 Eg of 6.0 eV between
the valence and conduction bands, which are formed pre-
dominantly by O 2p and Ce 5d states, respectively. The va-
cant 4f states lie in the gap. In Ce2O3, on the other hand, one
electron per Ce atom populates a Ce 4f state, resulting in a
single occupied Ce 4f peak, which lies in the Eg gap, 2.4 eV
Eg-f below the conduction band,7 which is formed to a large
extent by Ce 5d+4f states. As Eg-f, we denote the energy
difference between the lowest 4f state and the vacant con-
duction band. This 4f state is empty lowest unoccupied for
CeO2 and occupied by a single electron for Ce2O3.

For CeO2, the local, semilocal, and hybrid functionals
yield an insulating solution, which is in agreement with spec-
troscopic and optical reﬂectivity measurements.9,62,63 The
empty Ce 4f states can be identiﬁed in the band gap see Fig.
3. A slight admixture of Ce d and Ce f character into the
predominantly O 2p valence band can be observed see also
Ref. 9. As usual, LDA and PBE results show the typical
underestimation of band gaps, namely, 5.61 LDA and
5.64 eV PBE. These values correspond to the energy dif-
ference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoc-
cupied band located above the Ce 4f states in the gap.
The hybrid functionals instead, overestimate the band
gap, speciﬁcally, 7.93 PBE0 and 6.96 eV HSE. The
1 eV larger value for the PBE0 case is in line with previ-
ous studies33 and related to the use of a screened exchange
interaction in the HSE functional as opposed to the bare
Coloumb kernel in the PBE0 case.
For the magnetic Ce2O3 system, PBE0 and HSE yield an
AF insulating ground state driven by the ordering of the
partially occupied Ce 4f orbitals in the band gap. This order-
ing is consistent with magnetic susceptibility measurements.8
The AF solution is by 6 PBE0 and 5 meV HSE lower in
energy than the FM insulating solution. By inspecting the
local DOS, we found an occupation of the Ce 4f states by
almost one electron, which gives rise to a magnetic moment
of 1.0B per Ce atom, in good agreement with the experi-
mental value of 1.085B.8 The calculated magnetic moments
are given in Table II. We also found that, similarly to CeO2,
the PBE0 functional overestimates the Ce2O3Eg-f band gap,
wheres the HSE results are in excellent agreement with ex-
periment 3.5 PBE0 and 2.5 eV HSE with the experimen-
tal value being 2.4 eV.
The DOS in Fig. 3 indicates that local and semilocal func-
tionals yield a metallic solution for the ground state of
Ce2O3; however, a careful analysis of the band structure
shows a semi-metallic character with a mini-band-gap of
10 meV Eg-f in the PBE case. The FM solution has a
magnetic moment of 2.0B per formula unit, which is 60
LDA and 110 meV PBE lower in energy than the AF
solution. We note that the mini-band-gap vanishes in the
LDA using reliable all-electron methods PAW and FP-L/
APW+LO, as reported recently by Kresse et al.12 Fabris et
al. incorrectly calculated a large Eg-f gap for Ce2O3 even
using the LDA functional but this result was an artifact of an
inaccurate pseudopotential.12,13
The pragmatic DFT+U approach works again reasonably
well for Ce2O3 and gives results similar to the hybrid func-
tional. An AF insulating ground state is obtained with the AF
solution being 3 LDA+U and 2 meV PBE+U lower in
energy than the FM conﬁguration. We found that the precise
structure and volume play a signiﬁcant role in the magnitude
by which the AF solution is preferred. For instance, using the
experimental Ce2O3 structure, the AF-FM energy difference
increases by one order of magnitude to about 50 meV.
A major difference between the hybrid functional and
DFT+U approach arises for the size of the Eg and Eg-f band
gaps see Fig. 3. Speciﬁcally, the CeO2 band gap Eg
=5.3 eV in DFT+U is smaller than the experimental one
6.0 eV and much smaller than the PBE0 and HSE values
7.9 and 7.0 eV. In the case of Ce2O3, the deviations are less
severe. In particular, the DFT+U Eg-f gap equals 2.4 LDA
+U and 2.6 eV PBE+U, while the experimental value and
HSE values are 2.4 and 2.5 eV, respectively. One could ar-
gue that in order to improve the agreement with experiment
different values of Ueff should be used. However, from the
calculated band gaps at the  point see Fig. 4 as a function
of Ueff, we conclude that the fundamental gap Eg in CeO2 is

roughly constant. This is not particularly astonishing, since
the Ueff acts on the Ce 4f states only, and the valence and
conduction bands have predominantly O 2p and Ce 5d char-
acter. The position of the 4f states cf. Fig. 4, reported as
Eg-f—the difference between the eigenvalue of the lowest 4f
state and the lowest unoccupied band at the  point—is
strongly affected by Ueff in Ce2O3. For Ce2O3, an increase of
Ueff shifts the occupied Ce 4f state away from the conduc-
tion band, as expected. In CeO2 an increasing Ueff shifts the
empty f states toward the conduction band, in turn reducing
the values of Eg-f.

Metallic nonmagnetic -Ce has been considered in the
face-centered cubic structure,64 while the spin-polarized cal-
culation for the O2 molecule was performed in an ortho-
rhombic box 121314 Å3. For the calculation of the
atomization energies we evaluated the spin-polarized total
energy of the free O and Ce atoms using the same ortho-
rhombic box. For both the Ce and O atoms, no constraint
was imposed on the one-electron occupation. For the particu-
lar case of O2 a hard oxygen PAW potential with a cutoff
energy of 1000 eV was employed. The atomization energies
are reported in Tables I, II, and IV. Zero-point vibrational
energy contributions are not included. The heats of formation
and reduction energy are summarized in Table IV along with
the experimental results at room temperature 298 K.
Table III shows satisfactory agreement between the PAW
and L/APW+LO methods. The poorer performance of LDA
with respected to PBE is as expected.57,58 Table III also
shows that hybrid PBE0 and HSE functionals signiﬁcantly
diminish the characteristic overestimation of the O2 atomiza-
tion energy by the LDA and GGA functionals. 32,39,65,66 How-
ever, for bulk Ce, hybrid functionals underestimate the at-
omization energy with respect to experiment and perform
much worse than PBE. Similar problems have been recently
reported for the atomization energy of d metals. It has been
argued that these discrepancies are related to the overestima-
tion of the exchange splitting in d atoms, with a simultaneous
increase of the spin-polarization energy.33 Thus, the spin-
polarized free atom is overstabilized compared to an artiﬁcial
non-spin-polarized one. Note that errors in the atomic Ce
energies will not affect the formation energies reported be-
low. We furthermore note that the HSE and PBE0 functionals

tend to overestimate the spin-polarization energy of magnetic
	-Ce, making it too stable compared to -Ce, whereas
semilocal functionals predict 	-Ce to be too unstable com-
pared to -Ce. Thus the face transition from - to	-Ce is not
satisfactorily described by any of the mean-ﬁeld ap-
proaches used in the present work.
The results for the heats of formation and reaction energy
are summarized in Table IV. A major problem is that the
heats of formation are very difﬁcult to measure experimen-
tally, which is related to difﬁculties in preparing defect-free
ceria with a well-deﬁned oxidation state. The most recent
experimental values are found in the last row, and they differ
from all previous values by up to 1 eV. This uncertainty
makes it difﬁcult to put any ﬁrm statement on the reliability
of the PBE and hybrid functionals for the relative energetics
of cerium oxides.
Tentatively, it is, however, clear that the PBE functional
underestimates the formation energies and overestimates the
reduction energy HCeO2→Ce2O3 albeit only slightly. In all
likelihood, the good agreement for HCeO2→Ce2O3 is related
to a fortuitous cancellation of errors. A recent investigation
of a large number of oxidation reactions for 3d metals and
simple metals MOx+ y−x
2 O2→MOy has found that the GGA
underestimates the reaction energies of oxidation systemati-
cally by roughly 1.36 eV/O2.70 One can correct for this er-
ror, by shifting the O2 reference energy by 0.68 eV per 1/2
O2, i.e., by making O2 less favorable. Applying such a cor-
rection brings the absolute formation energies 11.60 eV
CeO2, 18.34 eVCe2O3 indeed into closer agreement with
recent experiments, but it also increases the reaction energy
HCeO2→Ce2O3 to an unrealistically large value of 4.86 eV.
Although such considerations are necessarily rather specula-
tive, they demonstrate that the agreement on the PBE level is
fortuitous and not related to a proper description of the un-
derlying bonding properties of CeO2 and Ce2O3.
Using the latest experimental values as a point of refer-
ence, the hybrid functionals seem to perform better for the
absolute formation energies, but the reduction energy of
CeO2 into Ce2O3 is underestimated and predicted to be only
3.14 eV PBE0 and 3.16 eV HSE. We have recently cal-
culated the heat of formation of a large number of
oxides,33,71 ﬁnding that hybrid functionals consistently un-
derestimate the Hf values, as the PBE functional does; but
for the hybrid functionals the error amounts only to roughly
0.3 eV per 1/2 O2. Correcting for this systematic error yields
a reaction energy of about 3.45 eV in reasonable agreement
with the experimental estimates, but admittedly such a cor-
rection worsens the absolute formation energies slightly. It is
fairly obvious that none of the present functionals is able to
give a consistent and completely satisfactory picture of the
relative formation energies of ceria.
Turning now to the DFT+U approach, we ﬁnd that LDA
+U
and
PBE+U
underestimate
the
reduction
energy
HCeO2→Ce2O3 see Table IV. In the latter case the deviations
are fairly large about 1.3–1.7 eV with respect to the most
recent experimental data69, whereas the LDA+U method
performs better with an underestimation similar to that of the
hybrid functionals 0.5–1.0 eV. We reemphasize here that
the DFT+U results depend not only strongly on the chosen
values of Ueff and on the choice of the underlying functional,
but also on the nature of the projection orbitals. From the
calculated reduction energies as a function of Ueff see Fig.
5, we conclude that the magnitude of HCeO2→Ce2O3 linearly
increases with decreasing Ueff values, which is in agreement
with previously reported DFT+U studies by Fabris et al.13 It
is discouraging that the Ueff value 3.25 eV that corrects
the LDA+U reduction energy would yield, for example, a
worse smaller Eg-f Ce2O3 gap and smaller Ce2O3 equilib-
rium volume see Fig. 2. For the PBE+U case, the situation
is similar.
Fabris et al.13 have shown that the linear dependence on
the value of Ueff can be removed by applying the U term to
localized Wannier-Boys functions. Their DFT+U reduction

energies for the same values of Ueff as in this work with
both types of orbitals are reproduced in Table IV. Those
calculated with the atomiclike functions are in reasonable
agreement with our values; discrepancies are possibly related
to the use of ultrasoft pseudopotentials compared to the PAW
potentials. The deviations of values obtained with the
Wannier-Boys orbitals are considerably large, for the LDA
U in particular. Reportedly the values obtained with the
Wannier-Boys orbitals do not depend on Ueff.
IV. DISCUSSION
We have reported hybrid DFT Hartree-Fock calculations
on CeO2 and Ce2O3 bulk phases with periodic boundary con-
ditions and a plane-wave basis set, and we have compared
the results with the standard LDA and PBE cases, as well as
the DFT+U approach. The hybrid functionals yield equilib-
rium volumes in quantitative agreement with experiment,
and thus represent a pronounced improvement over the LDA
and PBE functionals. For the structural properties, this con-
cerns particularly Ce2O3 for which the volume increases
from the PBE to the hybrid functionals, opposite to the usual
volume decrease from semilocal to hybrid functionals.28,33
This unusual behavior is related to the localization of a
single Ce 4f electron in Ce2O3 for hybrid functionals, over-
coming the failure of semilocal density functionals that in-
correctly describe the 4f electron as delocalized in Ce2O3.
Therefore, the increase in volume is closely linked to the
proper description of the electronic structure.
In general, the HSE functional gives the most balanced
description of the electronic properties, with fundamental
band gaps and the position of the 4f states being close to
experimental values. The local and semilocal functionals fail
to yield a sizable band gap between the occupied 4f state and
the conduction band in Ce2O3. Anyway, a comparison be-
tween one-electron energies and the measured quasiparticle
spectra must be done with some caution, since generalized
Kohn-Sham one-electron energies are not related to quasipar-
ticle energies.
For the prediction of thermochemical properties, the hy-
brid functionals do not appear to provide a clear-cut im-
provement over the standard PBE functional, although com-
parison with experiments is rather difﬁcult, since the
experimental formation energies are not known very accu-
rately. Most notably, the hybrid functionals underestimate the
reduction energy H2CeO2→Ce2O3+ 1
2O2 by roughly
0.9 eV. On the other hand, the formation energy of CeO2 is
predicted very accurately, and that of Ce2O3 is overestimated
only slightly by 2%, whereas the PBE functional leads to an
underestimation by roughly 9% and 12%, respectively. It
seems that this is mostly related to a different description of
the binding in the O2 molecule for the hybrid and PBE func-
tionals cf. Table III. We have furthermore argued that the
good agreement of the reduction energy for PBE 4.28 eV
with experiment 4.03 eV is due to a fortunate error cancel-
lation, and not in line with other simple and transition metal
oxides.70
Comparison of the PBE0 and HSE, local, and semilocal
functionals with the DFT+U results shows that DFT+U
gives rather controversial results. Our calculations indicate
that LDA+U and PBE+U yield a better account than LDA
or PBE for most properties. However, as always, the results
depend on the U parameter. The equilibrium lattice con-
stants, the position of the occupied or unoccupied 4f states
in the band gap, and the reduction energy vary linearly with
the effective Hubbard U values. Certainly the DFT+U
method does not possess any predictive capabilities, and
worse, in the present case, there is no unique U that gives a
reasonable account of structural parameters, the relative en-
ergies of different oxides, and spectroscopic properties. If
one is forced to make a choice, then our calculations suggest
that for PBE a very small value of Ueff 2.0 eV would give
the best overall description for the energetics, lattice con-
stants, and magnetic ordering in Ce2O3, instead of the calcu-
lated value of 4.50 eV.13 For LDA, the Ueff should be chosen
around 3.0–4.0 eV.
We ﬁnally note that a recent publication by Hay et al.72
gives very similar results for the structural and electronic
properties of CeO2 and Ce2O3 using the LDA, PBE, and
HSE functionals. These calculations were carried out using
periodic boundary conditions and Gaussian-type orbitals, but
did not discuss the thermodynamic properties. Hay et al. ﬁnd
a 0.2% underestimated CeO2 equilibrium volume for the
HSE functional. Their LDA and PBE results show the antici-
pated underestimation by 2.8% and overestimation by
3.2% of the equilibrium volume, respectively. In this study
we ﬁnd −0.6% HSE, −2.2% LDA, and +3.3% PBE de-
viations. For Ce2O3, the agreement is similar, namely, −2.0%
HSE, −8.9% LDA, and −2.0% PBE compared to our
−0.7% HSE, −8.9% LDA, and −2.7% PBE data. We
observe that in the study by Hay et al. the c/a ratio for
Ce2O3 was held ﬁxed at the experimental value for the HSE
functional. The overestimation of the CeO2 O 2p–Ce 5d
band gap by 1 eV for the HSE functional, has been as-
serted by both Hay et al. and the present work. For Ce2O3,
the HSE predicted Eg-f Ce 4f-5d 4f band gap is by 0.8
Hay et al. and 0.1 eV this work overestimated. We note
that the screening parameter  in the HSE functional used in
the work by Hay et al. might differ from the one 
=0.158 a.u. used in the HSE implementation employed in
this work.40
V. SUMMARY
In summary, the hybrid HSE functional seems to provide
a reasonably balanced description of CeO2 and Ce2O3. Most
noticeably, the lattice constants can be predicted with
roughly 1% precision, and the localization of a single 4f
electron in Ce2O3 is well described, with the energy of the 4f
states even matching measured spectra. It is, however, also
clear that signiﬁcant shortcomings remain, in particular, in
the description of the relative energetics. The quest for im-
proved functionals is still open, although it must be empha-
sized that the present study focuses on one of the most “dif-
ﬁcult” elemental oxides in the periodic table.
