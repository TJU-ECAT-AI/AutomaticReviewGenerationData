that small clusters of atoms can be used successfully to simulate thc local surroundings of a substitutional Al ion in quartz,

1. Introduction 
Aluminum occurring as A13', substituting for Si'" , 
is 
an impurity very commonly found in crystalline quartz, 
being present in concentrations varying widely but most 
often in the range 10- 100 ppm AI/Si (1). Com- 
prehensive reviews of the field of paramagnetic alumi- 
num and other impurity centres in quartz are available 
(2, 3). In normal quartz, each Si cation occurs at the 
centre of a somewhat distorted oxygen tetrahedron, 
with each oxygen anion bridging the cations of adjacent 
tetrahedra. It is important to note that there are two 
different Si-0 bond lengths in quartz, each SiO, group 
having'-a pair of oxygens with long bonds and a pair of 
oxygens with short bonds. Every oxygen anion thus has 
one bond of each type. For any given quasi tetrahedron 
in the crystal, we will use the symbols 0 ( > )  and 0 ( < )  
to label the oxygen ions of the two types, irrespective 
of changes in bond lengths (possibly even in their rela- 
tive lengths) caused by the presence of an aluminum ion 
and possibly one or more holes in the electron orbitals 
on the oxygen(s). 
It is known (4-7) that the centre [A10,I0 contains a 
hole trapped in the nonbonding p orbital of an oxygen 
adjacent to the aluminum. Thus its electron spin S = 
112. The hole in ground state [A10,I0 is now known, 
from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, to 
be trapped on one of the two equivalent oxygens O(>) 
(8). A thermally accessible excited state, [A~O,];,, of 
the single-hole centre has the hole located on either 
oxygen 0(<) (8, 9). Above room temperature, the hole 
rapidly "jumps" among all four adjacent oxygens (10). 
Schnadt and Schneider (9) suggested that the trapped 
hole in [A10,I0 behaves like a small bound polaron. 
Using this model, Schirmer (1 
1 ,  12) considered the 
optical absorption associated with [A1O,]O as a light- 
induced hole transfer from one oxygen O(>) to the 
other one, acting against the self-induced trapping po- 
tential. Kerssen and Volger (13, 14) suggested that the 
localized elect$ dipole created by the trapped hole on 
[A10,I0 is strongly coupled to lattice phonons. The 
model of a charged particle in a one-dimensional double 
potential well, treated by Sussmann (1.5, 16), was used 
by the above authors (and various others (17- 19)) to 
explain the high dielectric loss observed in quartz as 
being due to hole-jumping between oxygens O(>) in 
rAIO,lO.

is the observed probability (20) for two elec- 
trons to be knocked out of the aluminum region, 
resulting in the centre [AlO,]+. This species decays if 
the crystal is warmed to room temperature. [AIO,]' in 
its ground state was shown to have two holes, one each 
on the two oxygens O(<) adjacent to the aluminum ion. 
This centre has an electron spin S = 1 and thus is in a 
triplet state. The structure has two-fold symmetry about 
the ,

 axis, as deduced from the form of the EPR param- 
eter matrices (20).

Although very precise data on the various aluminum 
impurity centres in quartz have been obtained, there is 
no accurate structural information about these centres. 
To date, EPR data, therefore, had to be compared with 
pure quartz structural data and from this information the 
geometry of the impurity centre had to be inferred. Our 
calculations will be used to arrive at probable geome- 
tries for the various centres. Comparison of the calcu- 
lated electronic structures for the various centres with 
the experimental results will lead to a better under- 
standing of the changes which occur in quartz when 
aluminum substitutes for silicon and when subsequent 
irradiation produces one or more holes at such a site.

 alpha-quartz 
Alpha-quartz exists in two enantiomorphic forms, 
left and right quartz, with crystal structures belonging 
to trigonal space groups P 3 , 2  
I and P3?2 
1 respectively, 
with reference to a right-handed Cartesian coordinate 
system. The EPR results (8, 20) and the SCF-MO cal- 
culational results in this report are expressed for right 
quartz in such a coordinate system. The origin is taken 
to be the intersection of a large c-axis channel with one 
(= 
LiI) 
of the three crystallographic two-fold axes. Axis 
; 
is identical with 2,; axis 5 is parallel to the 
(optic) 
axis. We consider any silicon on i?,, plus its 0 
and Si nearest neighbors, and use the nomenclature of 
Nuttall and Weil (8) to label the atomic positions. The 
Cartesian coordinates for such a Si,O, unit are given in 
Table I .  This cluster of atoms is the basis for the models 
used herein for the SCF-MO calculations. We shall 
refer to the silicon ion replaced by aluminum as Si(0). 
The local symmetry at the central ion Si(0) position 
is Cz 
(about Li,) with the two pairs 0 ( > )  and 0 ( < )  of 
symmetry-related oxygens having, at 94 K, silicon- 
oxygen bond lengths of 1.6145 and 1.6101 /!, 
respectively (2 
1). 
FIG. 
1. Models 1, 2, and 3 used in the SCF-MO calcu- 
lations. 
The primary model (the nine-atom model, alias 
model 1) used in the SCF-MO calculations consists of 
Si(O), or an aluminum ion substituting for Si(O), with 
four hydroxide groups located quasi-tetrahedrally 
around it. The cluster is shown in Fig. I. The oxygens 
initially are located in their normal quartz lattice posi- 
tions, as given above, while the hydrogens are 
positioned along the quartz 0-(next)Si bond direction 
with a 0 - H  bond length of 0.96 A. 
This value, 
occurring in H20z 
(22), is a typical one. Our nomen- 
clature in y%at follows will often omit explicit indi- 
cation of the terminating hydrogens in each model; for 
example. [A10,]- may designate [AI(OH),]- in dis- 
cussing our small model calculations. The initial 
Cartesian coordinates of the atoms in this model are 
given in Table I. The horizontal axis through all our 
structural diagrams is the 
axis (2, axis), positive end 
to the right; the 5 axis (? axis) is perpendicular to the 
plane of the figure, positive end up. 
In two other models (models 2 and 3 ) ,  
fifteen-atom 
clusters are used (Fig. I). Here two hydrogens, attached 
to pairs of O(<) an O(>) respectively in the Si(OH), 
cluster, have been replaced by SiH, groups. The silicon 
atoms of the latter groups are located in the original 
quartz Si positions while the hydride ions are located 
along the Si-(next)O bond directions. The Si-H bond 
length was chosen to be 1.48 /!; 
this is the length found 
in SiH, (23). These extended models are used as a

1.3. Calculations 
In the nb initio calculations reported here, we have 
used the programs Gaussian-70 (24) and Monstergauss 
(a version of Gaussian-76), modified for a DEC-2060 
computer (25). ' These programs utilize the single deter- 
minant Hartree-Fock self-consistent field - 
molecular 
orbital (HF SCF-MO) methodology to calculate the 
total energy E, of each model, i.e., the sum of the 
nuclear repulsion energy plus the SCF electronic 
energy. The atomic orbital basis set of Gaussian func- 
tions used for these calculations is the STO-3G minimal 
basis set available in the programs (26, 27). We per- 
formed mostly unrestricted HF (UHF) calculations in 
our models. The UHF equations give two manifolds of 
molecular orbitals, one containing the alpha-spin elec- 
trons, the other containing the beta-spin electrons. The 
atomic spin density is defined to be the difference be- 
tween the populations of the alpha and beta orbitals. 
The UHF equ_ations, however, give a wavefunction 
which is not necessarily an eigenfunction of the spin 
operator S and which represents not a pure spin state but 
a state contaminated by spin states of higher multi- 
plicities. This effect has been ignored herein as not 
significant for the total energies of the various models. 
Ratios of spin densities are used in comparisons with 
experiment, to minimize errors there. 
Geometry optimization of the models was carried out 
using two methods. The first one involved parabolic 
interpolation of energies calculated at three different 
values for the parameter in question, e.g., A1-0 bond 
length. A second method involved both the energies at

The optimizations were done using the following pro- 
cedures: 
1. The Al-0 (Si-0) bond lengths and the Al (Si) 
position on the x axis were simultaneously and indepen- 
dently optimized using the optimally conditioned opti- 
mization procedure. 
2. Bond angles were optimized one at a time, using the 
parabolic interpolation method described above. 
3. Steps 1 and 2 were repeated until satisfactory con- 
vergence to the energy minimum was obtained. This 
was taken to occur when the energy difference between 
two successive cycles was less than or equal to 0.001 
hartree and/or the gradients were all less than or equal 
to 0.004 hartreelrad for bond angles and 0.002 
hartreelbohr for bond lengths. 
During the geometry optimization of the nine-atom

models, the hydrogens were kept at their original posi- 
tions to approximate the effect of a fixed crystal lattice. 
Geometry optimization was done on the small 
models of various centres in quartz, including [Si0,I0, 
[AlO,]-, [A1O,]O, [A~o,]:,, 
and [AlO,]'. 
The best 
geometry (i.e., 
the one with the lowest total energy) of 
model 1 for each of these centres is reported in Table 2 
along with the corresponding total energy and spin. 
Diagrams depicting the minimum energy config- 
urations of the small models of the various centres are 
found in appropriate sections below. 
After the best geometries were reached for model 1 
of each of the centres, final calculations were done 
using the larger models 2 and 3. No geometry opti- 
mizations were done on the larger models due to the 
inordinately large amount of computer time required. 
However, atomic spin densities and net atomic charges 
for these extended models were calculated using the 
final geometries of the corresponding small models, 
and are reported in Table 3. Calculations done in- 
cluding the standard polarization d functions, available 
in the program Monstergauss, for aluminum and silicon 
showed only minor changes in the electronic structure 
of the small models; thus only the results for the min- 
imal basis calculations will be discussed below. 
We consider the uncertainty in the calculated bond 
lengths to be about 0.01 A, 
caused in part by the ap- 
proximate nature of the wavefunctions as well as by our 
choice of gradient magnitudes and energy differences 
accepted for defining the optimum geometry for the 
models. Newton and Gibbs (28) investigated Si(OH),, 
using an STO-3G basis set and a perfectly tetrahedral 
arrangement of the SiO, moiety with Si-0-H 
angles 
of 109.5" (yielding D?, 
symmetry for the cluster), and 
found the optimum Si-0 bond length to be 1.653 A. 
Hass eta/. 
(29), in another study of Si(OH),, using this 
basis set and a similar tetrahedral arrangement but with 
an Si-0-H 
angle restricted at 140" to mimic the sur- 
roundings in zeolites, caJculated the optimum Si-0 
bond length to be 1.590 A. In our small model we are 
using a distorted tetrahedral arrangement of the oxy- 
gens, with C? 
symmetry or lower, along with restricted 
hydrogen positions rather than restricted Si-0-H 
an- 
gles. In view of the above variations with the Si-0-H 
bond angle, we do not expect quantitative comparison 
of calculated-to-structural Si-0 
and AI-0 
bond 
lengths to be completely reliable. 
A study by Mezey and Hass (3O), reporting the 
results of a statistical analysis of the propagation of 
basis set errors incurred in ab initio calculations, shows 
that the STO-3G basis set may often giveoS=O bond 
lengths that are too long by more than 0.3 A. Although 
their bond moieties differ from ours, the lack of cl func- 
tions in our calculations is expected to result in the- 
oretical bond lengths that are longer than the experi-

2. Results and discussion 
2.1. [SiO,]": tlze pure quartz tetrahedral cluster 
Geometry optimization done on the small model of 
the pure quartz basic cluster, [Si0,I0, produces some 
displacement of the atom positions, as compared with 
the observed crystal structure at 94 K. To attain the 
minimum energy configuration,. the Si4' ion niove! 
with respect to the X-ray determined position by 0.05 A 
along the positive direction of the x axis. The two 0 ( > )  
oxygens moved 0.17 A 
from their crystallograp$ic po- 
sitions while the 0 ( < )  oxygens moved 0.20 A. The 
resulting Si-O(<) bond lengths are 1.701 A, com- 
pared with the normal quartz short bond length of 
1.6101 A at 94 K. The calculated Si-O(>) bond 
lengths are 1.692 A compared with the 1.6145-A long 
bond length in normal quartz. Thus, the respective cal- 
culated bond le~gth 
values bave interchanged. Howev- 
er, the difference (0.009 A) between the calculated 
Si-O(<) and Si-O(>) bond lengths is less than the 
estimated accuracy of the calculated bond lengths, i.e., 
they cannot be said to be significantly different from 
one another. 
The energy gradients calculated for models 2 and 3 
using the optimally conditioned method show that the 
atoms are fairly close (about 0.005 A) to their minimum 
energy positions, so that further optimization altering 
the positions predicted for them by model 1 is not re- 
quired. This gives justification to the decision to use 
only the smaller model in the geometry optimizations. 
2.2. [AIO,]-: the diarnagnetic aluminum irnpuriiy 
centre 
The centre [A10,]- is isoelectronic to [SiO,]'. The 
minimum energy geometry for models of these two 
centres (see Fig. 2) is very similar, the maximum dis-

placement of any atom being 0;07 A. This compares 
with displacements of up to 0.5 A for some of the atoms 
in the models of the paramagnetic one-hole and two- 
hole centres discussed below. With the final optimized 
geometry it is seen that the A l - 0  tond lengths for 
[A104]- have increased by about 0.02 A compared with 
the Si - 
0 bond lengths calculated for [SiO,]'. Such a 
trend is reasonable, since in normal aluminum oxid~s 
the average A1 - 
0 
bond length is found to be 1.78 A, 
while in similar sjlicates the average Si - 
0 
bond length 
is shorter (1.60 A) (3 
I). The small difference between 
the geometries of [A104]- and [Si0,I0 indicates that 
aluminum can occupy a silicon site in the quartz struc- 
ture with very little distortion of the surroundings. 
Just as with model [SiO,]", the final geometry- 
optimized model of [A10,]- shows that the respective 
Al- 0 ( > )  and A1 - 
0(<) bonds are reversed: the dif- 
ference b~tween 
these two optimized bond lengths is 
-0.01 8 oA, compared with a difference of 0.0044 +- 
0.0001 A for the corresponding bond lengths in pure 
alpha-quartz at 94 K. Recalling that we have set 0.010 
A as the limit of reliability of the calculated bond 
lengths, this reversal in relative bond lengths in the 
model [A104] is likely to be significant and suggests 
that in real quartz there is a trend towards reversal of the 
bond lengths when A13+ substitutes for Si4' in alpha- 
quartz. 
2.3. [AIO,]~: one-hole centre 
2.3.1. The grozlrzd state 
All our calculations on the small model for the one- 
hole center [AIO,]~, using the initial atomic positions 
appropriate for the geometry-optimized model 1 of 
[A104]-, resulted in broken symmetry and gave a large 
calculated atomic spin density on one of the 0(>) oxy- 
gens and very small spin densities on the remaining 
three oxygens, i.e., the hole is located on O(3) (or 
equivalently O(4)) and is not distributed over the 
oxygens. This is consistent with the observed EPR re- 
sults (8). During geometry optimization of the nine- 
atom model [AIO,]', the aluminum atom moved along 
a line given by direction cosines -0.55 1, -0.442, and 
0.708 (0 = 44.93", 4 = 218.77"). This change in 
position, along with the change in position of the hole- 
bearing 0(3), given by direction cosines 0.742, 
-0.594, and 0.31 1 (0 = 71.68", 4 = 321.33") resulted 
in an $crease 
of the Al-p(3) bond length from 
1.706 A in [A104]- to 1.990 A in [A104]0. 
This repre- 
sents a 17% increase in the A1 - 
O(ho1e-bearing) bond 
length compared with 12% as estimated by EPR (8). 
The aluminum relaxed to a position 0.28 A 
from the 
plane of the other three oxygens, forming nearly tri- 
gonal planar symmetry and indicating a trend from sp3 
to sp' hybridization of the A I ~ +  
orbitals. The geometry 
of the model is depicted in Fig. 3. The A1 - 
0 bond

lengths are 1.679, 1.669, and 1.685 A for 0 (  
I), 0(2), 
and O(4) respectively. 
A calculation was done using extended model 3, in 
which the aluminum and the oxygens were placed at the 
minimum energy positions found with model 1 (hole on 
O(3)) and the silicons were left in their quartz structure 
positiovs. This gives a Si(3)-O(3) 
bond length of 
1.639 A. Very little change was observed between the 
calculated atomic spin densities (see Table 3) for the 
oxygen and aluminum ions from the values obtained 
with the small model. Also it was found that the elec- 
tron spin density on the silicon, Si(3), closest to the 
hole-bearing oxygen is small and negative. The EPR 
parameter matrices AAl 
and As, (8) reveal a small nega- 
tive spin density on both the aluminum and silicon 
nearest the hole-bearing oxygen. The isotropic part A,,, 
of the hyperfine matrices is proportional to the mag- 
nitude squared of the wavefunction at the nucleus and 
to the nuclear g value for the nucleus in question. 
Therefore, the quotient A,,,/g, is taken to be propor- 
tional to th_e spin density at the nucleus. The ratio of 
these quotiints for silicon and aluminum observed in 
EPR experiments (8) is given by 
The analogous calculated ratio of atomic spin densities 
using model 3 is 7.14. The atomic spin density " 
is the 
sum of the orbital spin densities 'pi for the atom con- 
sidered. Because the p orbital vanishes at the nucleus, 
the spin density at the nucleus presumably is better 
approximated by the orbital spin density found in the 3s 
orbitals only. The resulting ratio is

This ratio of calculated spin densities is larger than the 
observed ratio by a factor of 2.22. An artificially high 
ratio 
could be due to the fact that, in model 3, 
the aluminum is surrounded by four oxygens, each of 
which causes delocalization of the spin density from the 
aluminum, thus reducing "p,,, whereas the silicon, in 
model 3, is surrounded by three hydrogens and only one 
oxygen. The better than order-of-magnitude agreement 
between [I] and [2] lends support to the models of 
[A1O4I0. 
The analysis of the "0 hyperfine data from EPR 
measurements done for [~lo,]' 
by Nuttall and Weil 
(32) yielded estimates of 0.12 and 0.87 for (c,I and Ic,,l, 
the coefficients of the oxygen 2s and 2p parts of the 
unpaired electron wavefunction, respectively. The pa- 
rameters obtained depend somewhat on the charge uti- 
lized for the hole-trapping oxygen. The effective charge 
assumed by Nuttall and Weil (32) for an oxygen ion 
from which one nonbonding electron has been removed 
is +0.5. This choice as the effective atomic charge on 
the hole-bearing oxygen was qualitatively correct, in a 
relative sense, because +0.5 was less negative than the 
effective charge on the other oxygens. The calculations 
done here, using model 3 of [A1O4I0, 
give the net atom- 
ic charge q = -0.28 1 on O(3) (Table 3). 
As mentioned above, the atomic spin density for 
O(3) found in model 3 of [A1O4I0 
is a sum of orbital spin 
densities. The set of three 2p orbitals in Table 4 can be 
transformed to yield a new set of orbitals whose prin- 
cipal coordinate system is given by x', y', z'. The 2p,. 
orbital contains the sum 1.024 of spin density con- 
tributions from the original 2 ~ , ~ ,  
2p,., and 2p, orbitals. 
Using the atomic spin density "o,,z,, given in Table 4, 
the ratio "pz,,/aP2r 
calculated in model 3 is 40. This is in 
good agreement with the ratio (Ic,I//c,I)' = 53 obtained 
from the coefficients above. From ref. 8, if we use Ic,l 
and Ic,l for q of O(3) = -0.28 1, we find (/c,l/l~,l)~ 
= 
52 and Icp12 + IcSl2 
= 0.90. The latter value suggests 
that the spin density is localized more on O(3) than was 
considered in ref. 8. 
The difference between the total energies obtained 
from two calculations done on the small model of 
[A10,I0, one using the atomic positions obtained from 
the optimized model [A10,]- and the other utilizing the 
optimized geometry of the small model of [A10,I0, is 
0.044 a.u. (1.2 eV). This difference is attributed to the 
self-trapping potential associated with the hole on one 
particular oxygen of the pair of initially equivalent oxy- 
gens. That is, the geometry relaxes so that the hole 
becomes deeply trapped on one oxygen, causing the 
symmetric double potential well present initially be- 
cause of C2 symmetry to become asymmetric. The 
actual minimum is associated with the relaxed hole- 
bearing oxygen O(3) in our case. The other is lost 
during the relaxation, and corresponds to the case in 
which the hole exists on the other long-bond oxygen 
O(4). 
According to Koopmans' theorem (33), the vertical 
ionization potential, defined as the energy required to 
remove one electron without perturbing the geometry of 
the system, is approximated by the orbital energy of the 
highest occupied molecular orbital. For model 1 of 
[A104]- this value is 0.040 a.u. (I. 
1 eV). A different 
method to determine the ionization energy involves 
taking the difference in the total energies of two calcu- 
lations, one in which the atomic positions and charge 
correspond to model 1 of [A10,]- and the other in 
which the atomic positions are unchanged but the 
charge is set to be 0, i.e., the charge of the one-hole 
centre. This gives a value of 0.029 a.u. (0.78 eV). 
These values are subject to many approximations and 
thus are not very accurate. They do, however, give an 
estimated value for the ionization energy of an electron 
from a nonbonding p orbital on an oxygen next to alu- 
minum in alpha-quartz. The estimated ionization 
energies are both lower than the self-trapping potential 
of the resulting hole, i.e., the centre [A10,I0 is sta- 
bilized by the self-trapping potential of the hole. 
2.3.2. AII excited state 
It has been determined, through EPR measurements, 
that there exist; an observable thermally excited state, 
[A~O~];,, 
of the uncompensated one-hole centre in 
which the hole is located on an O(<) oxygen bonded to 
aluminum (8,9). No analysis of the A1 and Si hyperfine 
splittings is available yet. In the present work, 
SCF-MO calculations have been done on a model of 
this excited state of the [A1O4I0 
centre. In these, the 
aluminum was first displaced along the x axis towards 
the 0(>) oxygens, resulting in an energy minimum 
with the hole trapped in an O(<) oxygen (in this case, 
O(2)). The geometry was subsequently allowed to re- 
lax, corresponding to the new e!ectronic configuration. 
The aluminum ion shifted 0.30 A, from the correspond- 
ing position in [A10,]-, along a direction 0.566, 
-0.702, -0.433 (0 = 115.64", + = 308.86") while 
O(2) moved in a direction given by -0.391, -0.830, 
0.397 (0 = 66.63", + = 244.76"), resulting 
a final 
Al-O(ho1e-bearing) bond length of 2.010 A. As in

model 1 of the ground state, there is no two-fold 
symmetry in [A~o,]:\ and the final positions of the 
aluminum and the other three oxygens in model 1 of the 
excited state result in nearly trigonal planar symmetry, 
indicating (as in [AIO,]') a trend towards sp2 
hybrid- 
ization. The other three oxygens had bond le!gths 
to the 
aluminum ion of 1.685, 1.647, and 1.669 A for O( 1 ), 
0(3), and O(4) respectively. 
The optimized model of [A~o,]:, has a higher total 
energy than the ground state [AIO,]O 
model in its final 
geometry by 0.001 1 a.u. (0.030 eV). A temperature 
dependence study of the EPR signals of the two centres 
gave exactly this value (9); however, a recent re- 
measurement yielded 0.042 eV.' 
Aluminum has a calculated atomic spin density "p of 
-0.0172 and -0.0212 for models 1 and 2 respectively, 
whereas Si(2) in model 2 has a "p value of -0.1 13. This 
is similar to the values found for A1 and Si(3) in 
model 3 of the centre [A~O,]' in its ground state 
(Table 3). The ratio "pSl/npAI 
= 5.32 is found for the 
excited state model 2 and, as shown above, apSi/npAl 
= 
7.14 for the ground state model 3. The ratio of s-orbital 
spin density for Si and Al in the excited state is 
Vsic 
,,<,

= 3.78 (cf. 5.68 for model 3 of the 
ground state [A~O,]'). 
We note that the difference between [A1O4]' and 
[AIO~];, is primarily confined to the location of the 
hole. The overall electronic structure of the two centres 
is very similar.

model of the two-hole centre [A1041i . The ground state 
of the model [AlO,]' was found to have a total spin 
S = 1, giving a triplet state. This agrees with the results 
of Nuttall and Weil (20). Our calculations showed the 
holes to be located on the two 0(<) oxygens of 
[AlO,]' . Again, this is consistent with experiment. 
In agreement with the two-fold symmetry of the pa- 
rameter matrices, evident in the EPR studies (20), two- 
fold symmetry of the atom positions about ,
?
 was ob- 
tained throughout the determination of the minimum 
energy geometry for the two-hole model, even though 
no such constraint was imposed. The aluminum ion was 
found to be displaced along the 2 axis by 0.30 A in the 
positive 2 direction (with respect to A
1
 in the optimized 
model of [A10,]-), away from the hole-bearing oxy- 
gens (Fig. 4). The tyo hole-bearing oxygens 0 (  
1,2) 
were displaced 0.30 A away from A1 while the other 
two oxygens moved into positions forming an 
O(3) - 
A1 - 
O(4)'angle of 152", indicating a trend to- 
wards sp hybridization of the aluminum orbitals. The 
Al - 
O(<) bond lengths have become markedly longer, 
1.892 A, 
than the A1 - 
O(>) bond lengths, 1.655 A. 
In a single restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF SCF-MO) 
calculation, the spin multiplicity 2 s  + 1 was con- 
strained to I. The atomic positions obtained for the 
geometry-optimized nine-atom model of [AlO,]- were 
used, with the total charge set to + 1, corresponding to 
the two-hole centre. This singlet state was found to have 
an energy of 3.6 eV above that of the triplet ground 
state of the optimized small model of [AIOJ]'. Because 
a complete optimization of the model of this two-hole 
singlet state was not carried out, we cannot make a 
direct total energy comparison with the model of the 
triplet state. However, the energy lowering was less 
than 1.6 eV during the geometry optimization for the 
small model of the triple state of [AlO,] '. Thus, it is 
expected that model 1 geometry optimization of the 
singlet stat6 of [AIO,]' could lower the total energy by 
about 1.5 to 2.0 eV. Hence it is expected that the small 
model of the singlet state of [AlO,]' will be higher in 
energy than model 1 of the triplet state [AlO,]' by at 
least 1.6 eV. This compares well with the results of the 
EPR experiments (20) in which an excellent fit to the 
observed spectra of the triplet state of [AIO,]+ was 
obtained without taking into account the corresponding 
singlet state. 
As in models 1 and 3 for the one-hole centre, the 
atomic spin densities on the oxygens varied only 
slightly between models I and 2 for the two-hole centre 
in its ground state (see Table 3). The spin density was 
found to be small and negative (-0.112) on each of the 
outer two silicons bonded to the hole-bearing oxygens. 
As above, we compare the ratio "s,/"p.,, with the ratio 
of the observed spin densities, calculated from the iso- 
tropic part of the hyperfine matrices for '9Si and "Al.

The ratio of the observed (34) spin densities at the 
nuclei is 0.743, whereas the ratio of the calculated 
atomic spin densities is 2.04. In this case the calculated 
spin densities erroneously suggest that the spin density 
at the nucleus should be higher for silicon than for 
aluminum. One may consider only the orbital spin den- 
sity in the 3s orbitals of silicon and aluminum in model 
2 of [AlO,It, giving 
The calculated versus observed spin density ratios yield 
1.37/0.743 = 1.84, close to the ratio 2.22 between the 
calculated and observed spin density ratios for model 3 
of [A10,I0. This similarity suggests the presence of a 
systematic error which causes apSi(3.r)/apA1(3.r) 
to be too 
large. One likely reason for the discrepancy is the poor 
approximation to the radial part of the atomic wave- 
function afforded by the ~aussian 
functions. It should 
be noted, however, that even our better than order-of- 
magnitude agreement between experiment and calcu- 
lation is gratifying and lends confidence to conclusions 
drawn from the electronic structure of the models (1, 2, 
and 3) of all the centres studied.

highest total energy, ca. 0.144 a.u. (3.92 eV) higher 
than the ground state one-hole model [A1O,]O. The 
[A1O4]- model has a total energy ca. 0.072 a.u. 
(1.96 eV) higher than that of the [A1O,]O 
model. Experi- 
mentally, it is known that the centre [A1041t is less 
stable than [A1O4I0, 
i.e., it decays at temperatures just 
above 100 K whereas [A10,I0 is stable, even above 
room temperature, dependent on what other centres 
present release electrons upon heating. The dia- 
magnetic species [A10,]- has not been observed experi- 
mentally, i.e., iphas been observed only in the presence 
of a nearby isterstitial cation M t ,  suggesting that 
[A1O4]- is relatively unstable. 
On irradiating aluminum-containing quartz at low 
temperatures (<77 K), luminescence is observed and 
measured (35) to have three bands at wavelengths 440, 
435, and 380 nm. The 380 band was explained by a 
recombination of a freed electron with the alkali- 
compensated aluminum one-hole centre (to be dis- 
cussed in the second paper in this series). A possible 
source of one other band may be a recombination of an 
electron with the centre [A104]+ giving the centre 
[A1O4l0.

Thus recombination of centre [A1O4I0

would likely also require the simultaneous migration of 
an M + ion to act as charge compensator. This can be

culated by other authors using various techniques 
(37, 38). Although the concept of energy bands is not

"valence" and "conduction" bands calculated for the 
small model of [SiO4I0 are depicted in Fig. 6. The 
lowest of the valence bands consists mainly of oxygen 
2s orbitals with small contributions from silicon 3s and 
3p admixed in the lower and upper levels of these 
respectively. The upper valence -bands in the quartz 
model contain mostly oxygen 2p orbitals with some 
admixture of silicon 3s and 3p orbitals in the lower and 
upper levels of these bands, respectively. The upper 
valence band edge is composed mainly of oxygen 2p

with a small amount of an oxygen 2s and silicon 3s and 
3p admixture. The energies of all occupied orbitals are 
negative. 
Comparing the energy levels of [A10,]- (Fig. 7) with 
those of [Si04]0 
(Fig. 6), we can see that they, although 
shifted in energy, are composed of the same types of 
orbitals as the valence bands described in the previous 
paragraph. The energies of the valence bands as well as 
those of the conduction bands are shifted upward, the 
top edge oLf thevalence band being at -0.039 a.u. 
(- 1.06 eV) for the model [A104]- as compared with 
-0.324 a.u. (-8.82 eV) for [SiO4I0. 
This is consistent 
with the fact that the removal of electrons is easier near 
an aluminum ion in the quartz lattice, yielding [A1O4I0. 
The diagram of the molecular orbital energies for 
[A104]0 (Fig. 8) shows an obvious similarity to that of 
[SiO,I0 (Fig. 6) in both band structure and orbital ener- 
gies. We note that the nonbonding oxygen 2p beta- 
orbital energy in the former has increased to 0.230 a.u. 
This is the orbital from which the electron was lost to 
create the hole. In the lowest of the valence bands there 
is a significant difference between alpha-orbital and 
beta-orbital energies, where the oxygen 2s beta-orbital 
is of higher energy than the corresponding alpha- 
orbital. The calculations on the model [AlO4I0 
indicate 
some admixture into this orbital from the 3s and 3p

orbitals of the aluminum ion. We may thus expect ap- 
preciable spin density to be located at the nuclei of the 
aluminum and silicon nearest the hole-bearing oxygen. 
The calculated induced spin density in the lowest 
valence orbital of the model [AlO4I0 offers an ex- 
planation for the observed spin densities on A13' and 
Si4' in [A10,I0 in quartz. All other molecular orbitals in 
the model [A1O4I0 
show only small differences in the 
energies of the alpha-orbitals compared with those of 
the beta-orbitals. which indicates that the induced s ~ i n  
densities in these orbitals are all relatively small. 
In model 1 of the two-hole centre [AlO4It, the com- 
position of the valence bands is again very similar to 
that of [SiO4I0 
(see Fig. 9). Two nonbonding oxygen 
beta-spin p orbitals have an energy greater than zero, 
i.e., they are unoccupied. Similarly there are two oxy- 
gen 2s orbitals with-a 3s and 3~admixture 
from the 
u 
neighbouring silicon and aluminum atoms which have 
differing alpha-orbital and beta-orbital energies. In this 
case, as in [A1O4I0, both the aluminum and the two 
silicon atoms nearest the hole-bearing oxygens will 
have appreciable induced electron spin density due to 
these admixtures. 
2.7. Charge distribution 
Several papers in the literature report calculated net 
atomic charges qlel in pure alpha-quartz (see for exam- 
ple refs. 28 and 39-41 .) In our study, the calculations 
for the small model of [Si0,I0 give q values of 1.32, 
-0.49, 
and -0.50 
for Si, 0(<), and 0 ( > )  re- 
spectively, with the results reported in the above papers 
agreeing to within 5%. 
In the small model of [A104]-, q equals 1.16, -0.59, 
and -0.60 respectively for Al, 0(<), and 0(>). This 
finding is in agreement with the fact that the formal 
ionic charge on aluminum is only $3 compared with 
+4 on the silicon ion it has replaced. When considering 
the small model of the single-hole centre [A1O4I0, 
qAl 
has increased to 1.19 whereas q for the hole-bearing 
oxygen is -0.1 1. The remaining oxygens each have a 
charge of about -0.56, very close to the corresponding 
value for the small model of [A104]-. The small model 
of the two-hole centre [AlO4It yields a net atomic 
charge of 1.26 on aluminum and -0.11 on the hole- 
bearing oxygens. Again, the two remaining oxygens 
have net atomic charges of -0.52, close to the value for 
the model of [A104]-. 
We can calculate the electric dipole moment Ipl asso- 
ciated with the charge-unbalanced oxygen pair (related 
by two-fold symmetry in the absence of a hole). For 
[A1O4I0, 
ions O(3) and O(4) are separated by a distance 
of 2.540 A in the model 1 optimal geometry (Table 2), 
and the charges are listed in Table 3. It is interesting to 
note that these data give a value for lpl of 4.67 D 
(model 3) whereas the components pi obtained experi- 
mentally from dynamic and static measurement (42) are 
ca. 4.6 D for the electric field e I 
?, and ca. 6.2 D 
for 
11 ?. Similarly, for [A~O~]:,, 
ions O(1) and O(2) 
are 2.57 A apart, and the moment is 4.74 D 
(model 2). 
2.8. Comparison o

EPR special directions with 
calculated and structural data 
It is of some interest to compare the principal axes 
obtained from EPR parameter matrices with corre- 
sponding directrons in real quartz and with those de- 
rived in the small models of the various centres. The 
relevant data are displayed in Table 5. Exact alignment 
of any principal axis is to be expected only along an 
unperturbed crystal symmetry axis at the spin-bearing 
centre. Note also the limitation that the three axes are 
restricted to an orthogonal set. Thirdly, there are inac- 
curacies related to the fact that any two principal axes 
lose their distinct directions when the associated prin- 
cipal values approach each other, for example (8), 
(AA1)1.2 
for [ ~ 1 0 ~ ] O .  
Nevertheless, the directions for the 
principal values of each measured symmetric matrix, as 
previously shown, tend to be reasonably good indi- 
cators of the local structure of the centres in quartz 
(8, 20, 34). 
For example, the principal directions of the g matrix 
of [A104]0 correspond fairly closely (9) to directions

O(2) respectively is not symmetric about line L, we can 
expect b3 
not along L but rather along an axis which 
connects the centres of unpaired electron densities for 
these two ions. Furthermore, coqtributions from spin 
density on A
1
 will play a role. D, lies along an axis 
0.000,0.707,0.707 (0 = 45.00°, 4 = 90.00") whereas 
the axis L deviates from this by 19.7" (SCF-MO 
model) and 16.3" (X-ray data). 
The "A1 nuclear quadrupole matrix, as measured for 
the [A10+IA' 
centre by Nuttall and Weil (20), has a 
direction (QA,)? 
which lies along the i 
axis. The electric 
field gradient is expected to be caused primarily by the 
difference between the oxygens 0(3,4) and the hole- 
bearing oxygens 0(1,2). Thus, principal directions 
(QAIII 
and (Q,,), are likely to be close to line L and the 
normal N to the plane O(1) 
-A1 - 
0(2), respectively. 
For the unique principal value (Q,,),, the principal di- 
rection 0.000, 0.501, -0.866 (0 = 149.96", 4 = 
90.00") differs by 4.8" from N as calculated from the 
SCF-MO model. The direction 0.000, 0.866, 0.501 
(0 = 59.96", 4 = 90.00") for (QA,), is close to the 
direction 0.000,0.877,0.480 (0 = 61.33", 4 = 90.00") 
between the two short-bonded oxygens O(1) and O(2) 
in pure quartz. The calculations give an O(1)-O(2) 
direction of 0.000, 0.904, 0.426 (0 = 64.73", 4 = 
90.00°), 4.8" from the direction obtained by EPR. 
3. Summary 
Various aspects of the results of calculations de- 
scribed here agree very well with results of EPR and 
other experiments done on AlO, centres in alpha- 
quartz. The holes are found to be located on individual 
oxygen ions rather than distributed over several ions in 
the model. In both the one-hole [A10+I0 
and two-hole 
[AlO,]' centres, these calculations locate the holes on 
the same oxygens as identified previously from EPR 
data. The calculations yield a ground state triplet con- 
figuration for [Ale,]', consistent with observation. 
The relative total energies are consistent with the rela- 
tive stabilities of the various centres. 
Reasonably good agreement is found between the 
experimental results and the calculated values of atomic 
spin density, charge density, and structural parameters 
such as bond lengths and directions. The capability to 
represent the local surroundings of the aluminum im- 
purities suggests that the short-range effects are most 
important in determining the structure of the AlO, (and 
SiO,) moieties in quartz. The parameters calculated 
here by our present methods portray approximations to 
the static properties of the aluminum impurity in the 
quartz crystal. At present, dynamic effects in the crystal 
cannot easily be calculated due to the complexity of the 
system. 
The present series of calculations used Gaussian or- 
bitals as the basis set of atomic orbitals. The Gaussian 
orbitals do not properly approximate the wavefunction 
near the nucleus, i.e., they do not fulfill the correct cusp 
conditions, and hence can be used to calculate only 
approximate principal values of the EPR parameter 
matrices, i.e., of the hyperfine matrices and the g ma- 
trix. Further calculations using geometries obtained 
here, with an improved basis set of atomic orbitals, 
could possibly give further valuable information for 
improved interpretation of the EPR data on these cen- 
tres. 
Work on models of the cation-compensated alumi- 
num centres will be reported in the second paper of this 
series.
