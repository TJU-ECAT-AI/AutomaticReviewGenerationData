The
 methodology
 for  computing
 correlations
 between
 continuous
 descriptors
 of
 catalytic
 materials
 and
their
 performance
 in  the  catalysed
 process
 is  addressed.
 Continuous
 descriptors
 are  typically
 molar  frac-

 of individual
 components
 of  the  catalyst,
 whereas  the performance
 is
 represented
 most
 frequently
by
 yield
 or  selectivity
 of
 reaction
 products  or  conversion
 of  key feed  components.
 Measures
 of  various

 of  correlation
 are  recalled,
 and  their  descriptor-wise
 application
 to  catalytic
 data
 for  computing
 cor-

 between
 the  composition
 and  performance
 of  catalysts
 is  presented.
 The  paper  also
 compares
the

 of variance,
on
 the other

 Introduction
The
 overall
 objective
 of
 the
 analysis
 of
 data
 from
 catalytic
 exper-
iments
 with
 different
 solid
 materials
 is
 typically
 stated
 as
 follows:
Find
 correlations
 between
 the
 composition
 of
 catalytic
 materials
(and
 possibly
 other
 descriptors
 of
 their
 properties,
 or
 also
 of
 reac-
tion
 conditions)
 and
 their
 performance
 in
 the
 catalysed
 process,
usually
 represented
 by
 yield
 or
 selectivity
 of
 reaction
 products
 and
conversion
 of
 key
 reactants,
 or
 by
 some
 more
 complicated
 perfor-
mance
 function
 incorporating
 them
 (Gobin,
 Martinez,
 &
 Schüth,
2007;
 Omata,
 Kobayashi,
 &
 Yamada,
 2005;
 Suh
 et
 al.,
 2009;
 Valero
et
 al.,
 2009).
 In
 statistics,
 the
 correlation
 of
 a
 pair
 or
 a
 group
 of
random
 variables
 denotes
 in
 general
 some
 departure
 from
 fully
independent
 behaviour
 of
 those
 variables,
 and
 it
 is
 taken
 as
 an
indication
 of
 the
 existence
 of
 some
 relationship
 between
 them.
Several
 kinds
 of
 such
 a
 departure
 exist,
 and
 various
 correlation
measures
 have
 been
 proposed
 to
 quantify
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 a
given
 pair
 or
 group
 of
 variables
 shows
 a
 correlation
 of
 the
 partic-
ular
 kind
 (cf.
 Section
 2).
 In
 catalysis,
 most
 of
 those
 measures
 have
not
 been
 in
 use
 yet,
 in
 spite
 of
 the
 well-known
 importance
 of
 corre-
lation
 analysis
 in
 system
 identiﬁcation
 and
 event
 detection
 (Fontes
&
 Embiruc
¸  u,
 2001;

 &
 Takai,
 2010).

processes
 are
 concerned,
 however,
 correlation
 between
 properties
and
 performance
 has
 usually
 been
 only
 indirectly
 deduced
 from
modelling
 the
 quantitative
 relationships
 between
 catalyst
 descrip-
tors
 and
 performance
 with
 some
 nonlinear
 regression
 model.
 Such
a
 model
 is
 frequently
 called
 quantitative
 structure-activity
 rela-
tionship
 (QSAR),
 quantitative
 composition–activity
 relationship,
or
 quantitative
 structure–property
 relationship
 in
 this
 context
(Farrusseng,
 Clerc,
 Mirodatos,
 &
 Rokotomalala,
 2009;
 Rothenberg,
2008;
 Serna,
 Baumes,
 Moliner,
 &
 Corma,
 2008;
 Sieg,
 Stutz,
 Schmidt,
Hamprecht,
 &
 Maier,
 2006).
 The
 attractive
 feature
 of
 regression
models
 is
 that
 they
 do
 not
 restrict
 the
 characterization
 of
 how
catalyst
 descriptors
 correlate
 with
 performance
 to
 only
 one
 sin-
gle
 number,
 like
 correlation
 measures
 do.
 Instead,
 they
 reveal
 how
the
 performance
 changes
 with
 changing
 values
 of
 descriptors
 (e.g.,
with
 changing
 values
 of
 molar
 fractions
 of
 individual
 components).
To
 this
 end,
 they
 use
 functions
 of
 many
 variables
 (as
 many
 as
 there
are
 descriptors),
 which
 represent
 not
 only
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 individ-
ual
 descriptors
 on
 the
 catalyst
 performance,
 but
 also
 the
 inﬂuence
of
 interactions
 between
 theoretically
 arbitrary
 groups
 of
 descrip-
tors.
 However,
 this
 feature
 is
 at
 the
 same
 time
 the
 source
 of
 a
 serious
difﬁculty
 with
 regression
 models
 –
 compared
 to
 correlation
 mea-
sures,
 they
 need
 a
 very
 large
 amount
 of
 data.
 A
 general
 rule
 is
 that
this
 amount
 increases
 exponentially
 with
 the
 number
 of
 considered
descriptors
 (Cawse,
 2001;
 Myers,
 Motgomery,
 &
 Anderson-Cook,
2009).
 Hence,
 even
 if
 data
 about
 as
 few
 as
 2
 catalysts
 were
 sufﬁ-
cient
 to
 model
 with
 a
 desired
 reliability
 a
 performance
 that
 depends
solely
 on
 a
 single
 descriptor,
 then

 needed
 to
 model
 with
 the
 same
 reliability
 a
 performance
 that
depends
 on
 10
 descriptors
 (a
 rather
 modest
 number
 in
 nowadays
catalysed
 processes).
 So
 many
 catalytic
 materials
 are
 not
 expected
to
 be
 tested
 in
 a
 single
 experiment
 –
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 fact,
 some
 pub-
lished
 applications
 of
 the
 QSAR
 model
 most
 popular
 in
 catalysis,
artiﬁcial
 neural
 networks,
 involved
 only
 several
 dozens
 of
 catalysts
(Corma,
 Serra,
 Argente,

 Dai,
 Wu,
 &
 Chen,
 1997;
 Kito,
 Hattori,
 &
 Murakami,

Therefore,
 the
 objective
 of
 this
 paper
 is
 to
 present
 the
 descriptor-
wise
 application
 of
 important
 kinds
 of
 correlation
 measures
 for
computing
 correlations
 between
 the
 composition
 and
 performance
of
 catalysts.
 The
 application
 of
 those
 measures
 is
 illustrated
 by
 a
detailed
 case
 study
 using
 data
 from
 high-temperature
 synthesis
 of
hydrocyanic
 acid,
 and
 compared
 with
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
 and
with
 the
 application
 of
 regression
 trees.
2.
 Methodology
 for
 computing
 different
 kinds
 of
correlation
As
 was
 already
 recalled
 in
 the
 introduction,
 different
 measures
of
 correlation
 between
 two
 random
 variables
 exist,
 indicating
 dif-
ferent
 kinds
 of
 relationships
 between
 those
 variables,
 e.g.,
 between
a
 particular
 descriptor
 of
 the
 catalytic
 material
 and
 a
 variable
representing
 its
 catalytic
 performance.
 In
 this
 section,
 all
 impor-
tant
 correlation
 measures
 encountered
 in
 the
 literature
 will
 be
explained.
 The
 explanation
 underlies
 two
 restrictions:
(i)
 It
 deals
 only
 with
 ordinal
 data
 and
 ordinal
 variables
 (though
 not
necessary
 continuous
 ones).
 This
 has
 two
 important
 reasons:
• Most
 usually,
 a
 positive
 correlation
 between
 random
 vari-
ables
 is
 understood
 as
 a
 concordance
 between
 the
 tendencies
of
 the
 correlated
 variables
 to
 assume
 high
 or
 low
 values.
 This
is,
 of
 course,
 applicable
 only
 to
 ordinal
 variables.
 Below,
 also
 a
more
 general
 approach
 based
 on
 general
 dependence
 will
 be
explained.
 However,
 the
 commonly
 encountered
 measures
corresponding
 to
 that
 approach,
 Spearman’s
 correlation
 coef-
ﬁcient
 and
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure,
 are
 actually
 also
used
 only
 for
 ordinal
 data
 (Maritz,
 1981;
 Myers
 &
 Well,
 2003;
Nelsen,
 2006;
 Schweizer
 &
 Wolff,
 1981).
 Although
 their
 gen-
eral
 deﬁnition
 covers
 also
 nominal
 variables,
 the
 methods
 for
their
 estimation
 from
 measured
 data
 require
 the
 data
 to
 be
ordinal,
 and
 some
 of
 their
 properties,
 which
 will
 be
 described
below,
 actually
 hold
 only
 for
 continuous
 random
 variables.
• The
 variable
 representing
 the
 performance
 of
 catalyst
 in
 the
catalysed
 process
 (such
 as
 yield,
 selectivity
 or
 conversion)
 is
not
 only
 ordinal,
 but
 even
 continuous,
 and
 we
 are
 primarily
interested
 in
 correlation
 between
 the
 performance
 and
 ordi-
nal
 descriptors,
 mainly
 fractions
 of
 individual
 components.
To
 correlate
 the
 performance
 with
 nominal
 variables,
 such
 as
the
 kind
 of
 employed
 support,
 methods
 applicable
 to
 nom-
inal
 data
 need
 to
 be
 used
 (see,
 e.g.,
 Agresti,
 2002;
 Reynolds,
1977;
 Sahai
 &
 Ageel,
 2000;
 Scheffé,
 1999),
 among
 which
 we
consider
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
 most
 useful,
 brieﬂy
 recalled
in
 Section
 2.5.
(ii)
 It
 concerns
 only
 pairs
 of
 random
 variables
 and
 is
 intended
 to
 be
applied
 to
 the
 correlation
 between
 a
 descriptor
 (e.g.,
 fraction
of
 a
 particular
 component)
 and
 the
 performance
 of
 a
 catalyst
in
 the
 process.
 Technically,
 most
 of
 the
 measures
 can
 be
 gen-
eralized
 to
 groups
 of
 three
 or
 more
 random
 variables
 (Block
&
 Ting,
 1981;
 Joe,
 1990,
 1997;
 Wolff,
 1981),
 for
 some
 of
 them
even
 various
 such
 generalizations
 are
 possible
 (Joe,
 1990,
 1997).
However,
 it
 is
 not
 appropriate
 to
 apply
 such
 measures
 to
 groups
of
 more
 than
 two
 descriptors
 because
 a
 relationship
 between
different
 descriptors
 (e.g.,
 between
 the
 fractions
 of
 two
 compo-
nents
 in
 catalyst)
 is
 typically
 not
 random
 (due
 to
 stoichiometry
and
 other
 chemical
 properties),
 thus
 it
 cannot
 be
 interpreted
 as
a
 relationship
 between
 two
 random
 variables.
2.1.
 Correlation
 corresponding
 to
 general
 dependence
Generally,
 correlation
 between
 random
 variables
 X
 and
 Y
 only
means
 some
 departure
 from
 their
 independence.
 From
 a
 stochastic
point
 of
 view,
 X
 and
 Y
 are
 independent
 if
 their
 joint
 distribution
H
 is
 the
 product
 of
 the
 distribution
 F
 of
 X
 and
 the
 distribu-
tion
 G
 of
 Y,
 i.e.,
 if
 H(x,
 y)
 =
 F(x)·G(y),
 for
 all
 x
 and
 y.
 Equivalently,
H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)
 =
 0
 for
 all
 x
 and
 y.
 Hence,
 if
 H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)
 >
 0
or
 H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)
 <
 0
 for
 any
 pair
 x,
 y,
 then
 this
 already
 indicates
some
 correlation
 between
 X
 and
 Y.
As
 an
 example,
 think
 of
 X
 as
 describing
 the
 molar
 fraction
 of
Mo-oxides
 in
 the
 active
 shell
 of
 some
 catalyst,
 of
 Y
 as
 describing
 the
yield
 of
 a
 particular
 reaction
 product.
 Let
 the
 ratio
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
considered
 catalysts
 containing
 Mo  in
 their
 active
 shell
 to
 that
 not
containing
 Mo
 be
 2:8,
 whereas
 the
 ratio
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
 considered
catalysts
 with
 yield
 above
 25%
 to
 the
 fraction
 with
 yield
 up
 to
 25%
be
 4:6.
 If
 now
 the
 yield
 is
 independent
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
 Mo-oxides
in
 the
 active
 shell
 of
 the
 catalyst,
 the
 set
 of
 all
 available
 catalysts
divides
 as
 follows:
• the
 fraction
 of
 catalysts
 containing
 Mo
 and
 with
 yield
 up
 to
 25%
is
 0.12;
• the
 fraction
 of
 catalysts
 containing
 Mo  and
 with
 yield
 above
 25%
is
 0.08;
• the
 fraction
 of
 catalysts
 not
 containing
 Mo  and
 with
 yield
 up
 to
25%
 is
 0.48;
• the
 fraction
 of
 catalysts
 not
 containing
 Mo  and
 with
 yield
 above
25%
 is
 0.32.
If
 any
 of
 these
 four
 fractions
 is
 different,
 then
 this
 indicates
 cor-
relation
 between
 yield
 and
 the
 fraction
 of
 Mo-oxides.
 Moreover,
 the
whole
 sequence
 of
 those
 four
 fractions
 is
 different
 in
 such
 a
 case:
For
 example,
 if
 the
 fraction
 of
 catalysts
 containing
 Mo
 and
 with
yield
 up
 to
 25%
 is
 actually
 only
 0.1,
 then
 this
 sequence
 is
 0.1,
 0.1,
0.5,
 0.3,
 indicating
 a
 positive
 correlation,
 whereas
 if
 that
 fraction
is
 0.15,
 the
 sequence
 is
 0.15,
 0.05,
 0.45,
 0.35,
 indicating
 a
 negative
correlation.
A
 simple
 way
 how
 to
 measure
 such
 a
 general
 dependence
 is
 to
average
 the
 difference
 H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 random
vector
 (X,
 Y),
 i.e.,
 to
 compute
 the
 expectation
E(H(X,
 Y)
 −
 F(X)G(Y)).
 
(1)
Calculating
 this
 expectation
 always
 gives
 values
 in
 the
 interval
[−1/12,
 1/12],
 where
 the
 lower
 bound
 −1/12
 is
 reached,
 e.g.,
 for
Y
 =
 −X,
 the
 upper
 bound
 1/12
 is
 reached,
 e.g.,
 for
 Y
 =
 X
 (Nelsen,
 2006).
Usually,
 a
 normalization
 by
 the
 constant
 12
 transforms
 the
 interval
[−1/12,
 1/12]
 to
 the
 interval
 [−1,
 1],
 leading
 to
 the
 measure
X,Y =
 12E(H(X,
 Y)
 −
 F(X)G(Y)),
 
(2)
called
 Spearman’s
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 (Lehmann,
 1975;
 Maritz,
1981;
 Myers
 &
 Well,
 2003).

 former,
 whereas
 yrank(i)
 is
the
 position
 of
 yi within
 the
 latter.
 If
 X
 and
 Y
 are,
 in
 addition
 to
 ordi-
nality,
 even
 continuous,
 then
 Spearman’s
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 has
the
 following
 important
 properties
 (Scarsini,
 1984):

(i)
 −1
 ≤
 X,Y ≤
 1;
(ii)
 Y,X =
 X,Y,
 whereas
 −X,Y =
 X,−Y =
 −X,Y;
(iii)
 if
 X
 and
 Y
 are
 independent,
 then
 X,Y =
 0;
(iv)
 if
 f
 is
 a
 function
 strictly
 increasing
 on
 the
 value
 set
 of
 X
 and
g
 is
 a
 function
 strictly
 increasing
 on
 the
 value
 set
 of
 Y,
 then
f(X),g(Y) =
 X,Y;
(v)
 if
 X
 and
 Y
 are
 with
 probability
 1
 strictly
 increasing
 functions
 of
each
 other,
 then
 X,Y =
 1,
 whereas
 if
 they
 are
 with
 probability
 1
strictly
 decreasing
 functions
 of
 each
 other,
 then
 X,Y =
 −1.
The
 properties
 (ii)
 and
 (iii)
 actually
 hold
 even
 if
 X
 and
 Y
 are
 only
ordinal,
 and
 the
 properties
 (ii)–(iv)
 hold
 also
 for
 the
 not-normalized
measure
 (1).
The
 implications
 in
 the
 properties
 (iii)
 and
 (v)
 cannot
 be
reversed,
 i.e.,
 from
 X,Y =
 0
 cannot
 be
 concluded
 that
 X
 and
 Y
 are
independent,
 and
 from
 X,Y =
 1/X,Y =
 −1
 cannot
 be
 concluded
 that
they
 are
 increasing/decreasing
 functions
 of
 each
 other.
 For
 exam-
ple,
 the
 difference
 H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)
 can
 have
 large
 positive
 values
in
 some
 areas
 and
 large
 negative
 values
 in
 other
 areas,
 but
 they
still
 can
 average
 out
 to
 zero.
 Consequently,
 Spearman’s
 correlation
coefﬁcient
 can
 serve
 neither
 as
 an
 indicator
 of
 the
 extent
 to
 which
two
 variables
 (e.g.,
 the
 fraction
 of
 a
 particular
 catalyst
 component
and
 yield
 of
 a
 particular
 product)
 are
 independent,
 nor
 the
 extent
to
 which
 they
 are
 increasing
 or
 decreasing
 functions
 of
 each
 other.
Therefore,
 a
 modiﬁcation
 of
 Spearman’s
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 has
been
 proposed
 in
 Schweizer
 &
 Wolff,
 1981.
 That
 modiﬁcation
 con-
sists
 in
 replacing
 H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)
 in
 (2)
 with
 its
 absolute
 value
|H(x,
 y)
 −
 F(x)·G(y)|.
 Hence,
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure
 is
 given
by:
X,Y =
 12E|H(X,
 Y)
 −
 F(X)G(Y)|.
For
 continuous
 X
 and
 Y,
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure
 in
 addi-
tion
 to
 changing
 the
 implications
 in
 the
 properties
 (iii)
 and
 (v)
 to
equivalences
 also
 modiﬁes
 the
 remaining
 properties
 (i),
 (ii)
 and
 (iv),
as
 follows:
(i′)
 0
 ≤
 x,
 y
 ≤
 1;
(ii′)
 Y,X =
 X,Y;
(iii′)
 X,Y =
 0
 
if
 and
 only
 if
 X
 and
 Y
 are
 independent;
(iv′)
 if
 f
 is
 a
 function
 either
 strictly
 increasing
 or
 strictly
 decreasing
on
 the
 value
 set
 of
 X
 and
 g
 is
 a
 function
 either
 strictly
 increasing
or
 strictly
 decreasing
 on
 the
 value
 set
 of
 Y,
 then
 f(X),g(Y) =
 X,Y;
(v′)
 X,Y =
 1
 if
 and
 only
 if
 X
 and
 Y
 are
 with
 probability
 1
 strictly
monotone
 functions
 of
 each
 other.
Due
 to
 the
 properties
 (i′),
 (iii′)
 and
 (v′),
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
measure
 can
 be
 interpreted
 as
 an
 intensity
 of
 correlation
 between
X
 and
 Y,
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 a
 distance
 of
 the
 relationship
 between
them
 from
 the
 situation
 that
 they
 are
 completely
 independent,
 and
closeness
 of
 that
 relationship
 to
 the
 situation
 that
 they
 are
 strictly
monotone
 functions
 of
 each
 other.
 In
 the
 catalytic
 context,
 such
 an
intensity
 of
 correlation
 between,
 e.g.,
 yield
 and
 the
 fraction
 of
 a
 par-
ticular
 component
 means
 the
 distance
 from
 the
 situation
 that
 yield
is
 completely
 independent
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
 that
 component
 and
closeness
 to
 the
 situation
 that
 yield
 is
 a
 strictly
 increasing
 or
 strictly
decreasing
 function
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
 a
 particular
 component.

 estimate
 sX,Y of
 X,Y based
 on
 a

 ((x1,

 (xn,

can
 be
 obtained
 through
 replacing

 Correlation
 corresponding
 to
 concordance
The
 most
 frequently
 encountered
 meaning
 of
 correlation
between
 X
 and
 Y
 is
 the
 concordance
 of
 higher
 and
 lower
 val-
ues
 between
 both
 variables:
 In
 the
 situation
 when
 X
 describes
the
 fraction
 of
 some
 catalyst
 component
 and
 Y
 describes
 its
 cat-
alytic
 performance,
 positive
 correlation
 means
 smaller
 fractions
 of
that
 component
 are
 associated
 with
 lower
 performance
 and
 higher
fractions
 with
 higher
 performance,
 whereas
 negative
 correlation
means
 that
 higher
 fractions
 of
 the
 component
 are
 associated
 with
lower
 performance
 and
 lower
 fractions
 with
 higher
 performance.
A
 possible
 measure
 of
 that
 association
 is
 the
 probability
 that
 for
two
 independent
 realizations
 (x1,
 y1)
 and
 (x2,
 y2)
 of
 (X,
 Y),
 x1 <
 x2
coincides
 with
 y1 <
 y2 and
 x1 >
 x2 coincides
 with
 y1 >
 y2 minus
 the
probability
 that
 for
 such
 realizations,
 x1 <
 x2 coincides
 with
 y1 >
 y2
and
 x1 >
 x2 coincides
 with
 y1 <
 y2. In
 the
 context
 of
 the
 above
 exam-
ple
 with
 X
 describing
 the
 fraction
 of
 Mo-oxides
 and
 Y
 describing
the
 yield
 of
 reaction
 product,
 this
 is
 the
 probability
 that
 from
 two
random
 catalysts,
 the
 one
 with
 higher
 Mo  fraction
 will
 also
 lead
 to
a
 higher
 yield
 minus
 the
 probability
 that
 it
 will
 lead
 to
 a
 lower
 yield.
That
 probability
 is
 called
 Kendall’s
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 (Hollander
&
 Wolfe,
 1973;
 Lehmann,
 1975):
X,Y =
 P[(X1 −
 X2)(Y1 −
 Y2)
 >
 0]
 −
 P[(X1 −
 X2)(Y1 −
 Y2)
 <
 0],
 
(5)
where
 (X1,
 Y1)
 and
 (X2,
 Y2)
 are
 independent
 random
 vectors
 gov-
erned
 by
 the
 considered
 joint
 distribution
 H.
 If
 at
 least
 one
 of
 the
variables
 X
 and
 Y
 is
 continuous
 (which
 is
 always
 the
 case
 when
one
 of
 them
 represents
 catalytic
 performance,
 as
 was
 already
 men-
tioned),
 then
 an
 unbiased
 estimate
 tX,Y of
 X,Y based
 on
 a
 sample
((x1,
 y1),
 .
 .
 .,
 (xn,
 yn))
 can
 be
 obtained
 by
 replacing
 the
 probabilities
in
 (5)
 with
 frequencies:
tX,Y =
2
#{(i,
 j)
 :
 (xi −
 xj)(yi −
 yj)
 >
 0}
 −
 #{(i,
 j)
 :
 (xi −
 xj)(yi −
 yj)
 <
 0}
n(n
 −
 1)
.
(6)
Another
 possible
 measure
 of
 the
 concordance
 of
 higher
 and
lower
 values
 between
 X
 and
 Y
 is
 the
 probability
 that
 a
 realiza-
tion
 x
 of
 X
 differs
 from
 a
 particular
 summary
 statistic
 of
 X
 (such
as
 expectation
 or
 median)
 in
 the
 same
 direction
 as
 a
 realization
 y
of
 Y
 differs
 from
 the
 corresponding
 summary
 statistic
 of
 Y.
 Most
frequently,
 median
 is
 employed
 as
 the
 summary
 statistic,
 because
of
 its
 robustness,
 in
 which
 case
 the
 measure
 is
 called
 medial
 corre-
lation
 coefﬁcient
 or
 Blomquist’s
 measure
 (Nelsen,
 2006).
 Similarly
 to
(5),
 it
 equals
ˇX,Y =
 P[(X
 −
 mX)(Y
 −
 mY)
 >
 0]
 −
 P[(X
 −
 mX)(Y
 −
 mY)
 <
 0],
 
(7)
where
 mX and
 mY denote
 the
 medians
 of
 X
 and
 Y,
 respectively.
Moreover,
 it
 can
 be
 shown
 (Nelsen,
 2006)
 that
 (7)
 substantially
simpliﬁes
 to
ˇX,Y =
 4H(mX,
 mY)
 −
 1.
 
(8)
An
 estimate
 bX,Y of
 ˇX,Y based
 on
 a
 sample
 ((x1,
 y1),
 .
 .
 .,
 (xn,
yn))
 can
 again
 be
 obtained
 by
 replacing
 the
 distribution
 function
H
 and
 the
 medians
 mX and
 mY with
 their
 empirical
 counterparts.
Consequently,
bX,Y = 4
n #{k
 :
 xk ≤ˆ
mX,
 yk ≤ˆ
mY}
 −
 1,
 
(9)
58
M.
 Holeˇ
na
 et
 al.
 /
 Computers
 and
 Chemical
 Engineering
 43 (2012) 55–
 67
where ˆ
mX and ˆ
mY are
 the
 empirical
 medians
 of
 X
 and
 Y,
 thus
 for
example,
ˆ
mX =
 xk +
 xk+1
2
if
 n
 =
 2k,
xk+1
if
 n
 =
 2k
 +
 1.
Very
 important
 is
 that
 for
 X
 and
 Y
 continuous,
 both
 the
 Kendall’s
and
 the
 medial
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 can
 be
 shown
 to
 have
the
 properties
 (i)–(v)
 listed
 above
 (Nelsen,
 2006;
 Scarsini,
 1984),
replacing
 X,Y with
 X,Y or
 ˇX,Y.
 This
 means
 that
 for
 continuous
random
 variables,
 also
 the
 Spearman’s
 X,Y actually
 measures
 the
concordance
 of
 higher
 and
 lower
 values
 between
 them,
 in
 spite
 of
being
 deﬁned
 in
 a
 more
 general
 setting.
2.3.
 Correlation
 based
 on
 bounding
 probability
 distributions
Besides
 the
 Spearman’s,
 Kendall’s
 and
 medial
 correlation
 coef-
ﬁcients,
 there
 is
 one
 more
 frequently
 encountered
 correlation
measure
 that
 has
 the
 above
 properties
 (i)–(v),
 therefore
 can
 be
interpreted
 as
 concordance
 of
 higher
 and
 lower
 values
 between
 the
fraction
 of
 a
 particular
 catalyst
 component,
 and
 a
 variable
 describ-
ing
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 catalyst
 in
 the
 catalysed
 process.
 This
 is
the
 Gini’s
 coefﬁcient
 (Nelsen,
 2006;
 Scarsini,
 1984),
 deﬁned
X,Y =
 P[(X1 −
 X2)(Y1 −
 Y2)
 >
 0]
 −
 P[(X1 −
 X2)(Y1 −
 Y2)
 <
 0]
+
 P[(X1 −
 X3)(Y1 −
 Y3)
 >
 0]
 −
 P[(X1 −
 X3)(Y1 −
 Y3)
 <
 0],
 
(10)
where
 (X1,
 Y1),
 (X2,
 Y2)
 and
 (X3,
 Y3)
 are
 independent
 random
vectors,
 (X1,
 Y1)
 governed
 by
 a
 particular
 joint
 distribution
 H,
(X2,
 Y2)
 governed
 by
 the
 2-dimensional
 distribution
 U(x,
 y)
 =
min(F(x),
 G(y)),
 and
 (X3,
 Y3)
 governed
 by
 the
 2-dimensional
distribution
 L(x,
 y)
 =
 max(F(x)
 +
 G(y)
 −
 1,
 0).
 To
 understand
 the
meaning
 of
 this
 deﬁnition,
 let
 us
 recall
 that
 L
 and
 U
 are
 bounding
probability
 distributions
 for
 the
 joint
 distribution
 H
 (Nelsen,
 2006):
L(x,
 y)
 ≤
 H(x,
 y)
 ≤
 U(x,
 y).
According
 to
 (10),
 the
 Gini’s
 coefﬁcient
 is
 the
 sum
 of
 two
 differ-
ences
 of
 probabilities:
• the
 probability
 that
 for
 independent
 realizations
 (x1,
 y1)
 and
 (x2,
y2)
 of
 random
 vectors
 governed
 by
 a
 particular
 joint
 distribution
H
 and
 by
 the
 lower
 bounding
 distribution
 L,
 respectively,
 x1 <
 x2
coincides
 with
 y1 <
 y2 and
 x1 >
 x2 coincides
 with
 y1 >
 y2 minus
 the
probability
 that
 for
 such
 realizations,
 x1 <
 x2 coincides
 with
 y1 >
 y2
and
 x1 >
 x2 coincides
 with
 y1 <
 y2,
• and
 the
 probability
 that
 for
 independent
 realizations
 (x1,
 y1)
 and
(x3,
 y3)
 of
 random
 vectors
 governed
 by
 a
 particular
 H
 and
 by
the
 upper
 bounding
 distribution
 U,
 respectively,
 x1 <
 x3 coincides
with
 y1 <
 y3 and
 x1 >
 x3 coincides
 with
 y1 >
 y3 minus
 the
 proba-
bility
 that
 for
 such
 realizations,
 x1 <
 x3 coincides
 with
 y1 >
 y3 and
x1 >
 x3 coincides
 with
 y1 <
 y3.
Using
 again
 the
 above
 example
 with
 X
 describing
 the
 fraction
of
 Mo-oxides
 and
 Y
 describing
 the
 yield,
 this
 sum
 is
 the
 probability
that
 from
 two
 catalysts,
 one
 of
 which
 was
 randomly
 obtained
 from
a
 population
 obeying
 some
 joint
 distribution
 H,
 and
 the
 other
 from
 a
population
 obeying
 in
 50%
 the
 lower
 and
 in
 50%
 the
 upper
 bounding
distribution,
 the
 one
 with
 higher
 Mo  fraction
 will
 also
 lead
 to
 a
higher
 yield
 minus
 the
 probability
 that
 it
 will
 lead
 to
 a
 lower
 yield.
An
 estimate
 gX,Y of
 X,Y based
 on
 a
 sample
 ((x1,
 y1),
 .
 .
 .,  (xn,
 yn))
can
 be
 obtained
 using
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 possible
 to
 simplify
 (10)
 to
(Nelsen,
 2006):
X,Y =
 2E(|F(X)
 +
 G(Y)
 −
 1|
 −
 |F(X)
 −
 G(Y)|),
and
 then
 replacing
 the
 distributions
 F
 and
 G
 with
 their
 empirical
counterparts.
 This
 leads
 to
 the
 estimate

 (11)
The
 statistician
 Gini,
 when
 introducing
 this
 correlation,
 actually
employed
 a

 estimate:
gX,Y =

(12)
where
 ⌊

 denotes
 the

 part
 of
 a
 real
 number.
 However,
 the
difference
 between
 both
 estimates
 vanishes
 with
 increasing
 n.

 e.g.,
between
 a
 particular
 component
 fraction
 and
 yield,
 is
 described
by
 a
 strictly
 increasing
 function.
 Similarly,
 the
 measures
 X,Y,
 X,Y,
ˇX,Y,
 X,Y achieve
 their
 lowest
 value,
 −1,
 whenever
 this
 dependence
is
 described
 by
 a
 strictly
 decreasing
 function
 (X,Y =
 1
 also
 in
 this
case).
 Sometimes,
 the
 correspondence
 of
 the
 values
 1
 and
 −1 to
such
 broad
 classes
 of
 functions
 can
 be
 disadvantageous.
 That
 dis-
advantage
 is
 for
 the
 measures
 X,Y,
 X,Y,
 ˇX,Y,
 X,Y further
 increased
through
 the
 already
 mentioned
 fact
 that
 the
 implication
 in
 the
property
 (v)
 cannot
 be
 reversed,
 i.e.,
 the
 measure
 can
 achieve
 the
value
 1/−1  even
 if
 the
 variables
 are
 not
 increasing/decreasing
 func-
tions
 of
 each
 other.
 In
 such
 situations,
 another
 correlation
 measure
is
 used,
 for
 which
 those
 values
 correspond
 to
 a
 more
 speciﬁc
 depen-
dence,
 namely
 to
 linear
 dependence.
 This
 is
 the
 linear
 correlation
coefﬁcient
 of
 X
 and
 Y
 (Cox
 &
 Hinkley,
 1974;
 Kendall
 &
 Stuart,
 1979),
also
 called
 Pearson’s
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 and
 commonly
 denoted
corr(X,
 Y),
 which
 is
 deﬁned
corr(X,
 Y)
 =
cov(X,
 Y)

var(X)var(Y)
(13)
and
 has
 the
 following
 properties:
(i)–(iii),
 listed
 above
 for
 the
 Spearman’s
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
(replacing
 X,Y with
 corr(X,
 Y));
(iv+)
 corr(X,
 Y)
 =
 1
 if
 and
 only
 if
 Y
 =
 aX
 +
 b
 with
 probability
 1,
 where
a
 >
 0,
 whereas
 corr(X,
 Y)
 =
 −1
 if
 and
 only
 if
 Y
 =
 aX
 +
 b
 with
 probabil-
ity
 1,
 where
 a
 <
 0.
For
 example,
 if
 again
 X
 describes
 the
 fraction
 of
 a
 particular
component,
 and
 Y
 describes
 yield,
 then
 corr(X,
 Y)
 =
 1
 indicates
 an
increasing
 linear
 dependence
 of
 yield
 on
 that
 fraction,
 whereas
corr(X,
 Y)
 =
 −1
 indicates
 a
 decreasing
 linear
 dependence.

 corr(X,
 Y)
 based
 on
 a

 ((x1,

 Comparison
 with
 analysis
 of
 variance
 and
 regression
 trees
Correlation
 measures
 are
 not
 the
 only
 way
 how
 to
 quantify
the
 strength
 of
 a
 relationship
 between
 random
 variables.
 Speciﬁ-
cally,
 a
 quantitative
 analysis
 of
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 random
 variables
 of
arbitrary
 kinds
 (including
 nominal
 variables)
 on
 a
 dependent
 con-
tinuous
 variable
 is
 the
 objective
 of
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance.
 There
is
 also
 an
 important
 kind
 of
 regression
 models,
 regression
 trees,
the
 construction
 of
 which
 incorporates
 information
 about
 the
 com-
binations
 of
 individual
 independent
 variables
 with
 the
 strongest
inﬂuence
 on
 the
 dependent
 variable.
A.
 Analysis
 of
 variance
 is
 an
 approach
 based
 on
 statistical
hypotheses
 testing
 that
 quantitatively
 analyses
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
varying
 the
 values
 of
 individual
 independent
 variables
 on
 the
 value
of
 a
 continuous
 dependent
 variable
 (Sahai
 &
 Ageel,
 2000;
 Scheffé,
1999).
 In
 the
 area
 of
 catalysis,
 independent
 variables
 include
 most
importantly
 variables
 describing
 the
 composition
 of
 the
 catalytic
material,
 both
 qualitative
 (whether
 a
 particular
 component
 is
 or
is
 not
 present
 in
 the
 material,
 or
 what
 has
 been
 used
 as
 sup-
port),
 and
 quantitative
 (fraction
 of
 a
 particular
 component
 in
 the
material).
 Dependent
 variables,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 are
 the
 vari-
ables
 describing
 some
 kind
 of
 catalytic
 performance,
 notoriously
exempliﬁed
 by
 yield
 and
 conversion.
 Recently
 published
 exam-
ples
 of
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
 of
 data
 from
 catalysed
 processes
include
 Cawse,
 Baerns,
 and
 Holena
 (2004),  and
 Moehmel
 et
 al.
(2008).
Analysis
 of
 variance
 assumes
 that
 each
 dependent
 variable
 fol-
lows
 some
 basic
 statistical
 model,
 in
 which
 the
 expectation
 of
 that
variable
 is
 viewed
 as
 the
 sum
 of
 the
 effects
 of
 individual
 inde-
pendent
 variables,
 called
 main
 effects,
 possibly
 superimposed
 by
their
 interactions
 of
 various
 complexity.
 The
 amount
 of
 available
data
 for
 each
 combination
 of
 values
 of
 input
 variables
 determines
how
 complex
 the
 basic
 model
 can
 be.
 The
 principle
 of
 the
 analy-
sis
 of
 variance
 consists
 in
 testing
 the
 hypothesis
 that
 a
 particular
main
 effect
 or
 interaction
 can
 be
 left
 out
 from
 that
 model
 with-
out
 signiﬁcantly
 changing
 the
 value
 of
 the
 output
 variable.
 If
 the
tested
 hypothesis
 is
 valid,
 then
 both
 models
 will
 give
 the
 same
error,
 otherwise
 leaving
 out
 the
 main
 effect
 or
 interaction
 will
cause
 the
 error
 of
 the
 model
 to
 increase.
 Therefore,
 the
 ratio
 of
both
 errors
 is
 computed
 in
 the
 analysis-of-variance
 method,
 and
if
 that
 ratio
 is
 signiﬁcantly
 higher
 than
 one,
 the
 tested
 hypothesis
is
 rejected.
 Provided
 that
 the
 individual
 errors
 are
 normally
 dis-
tributed,
 also
 the
 distribution
 of
 the
 error
 ratio
 is
 known
 (it
 is
 the
Fisher–Snedecor
 distribution).
 Using
 this
 distribution,
 the
 proba-
bility
 can
 be
 computed
 that
 the
 error
 ratio
 is
 as
 high
 as
 the
 value
corresponding
 to
 the
 measured
 data,
 or
 even
 higher.
 That
 proba-
bility
 is
 called
 achieved
 signiﬁcance
 of
 the
 test.
 The
 lower
 it
 is,
 the
more
 unlikely
 it
 is
 that
 the
 measured
 data
 could
 occur
 if
 the
 simpli-
ﬁed
 model
 is
 valid.
 Consequently,
 the
 more
 signiﬁcant
 is
 then
 the
effect/interaction
 that
 was
 left
 out
 from
 the
 model.
 For
 example,
if
 the
 catalytic
 material
 consists
 of
 support
 and
 active
 components
selected
 from
 a
 pool
 of
 10
 compounds,
 c1,
 .
 .
 .,  c10,
 then
 in
 the
 basic
model,
 the
 expectation
 EY
 of
 the
 yield
 Y
 equals
 the
 sum
 of
 main
effects,
EY
 =
 ˛support +
 ˛c1 +
 ·
 ·
 ·
 +
 ˛c10,
 
(15)
to
 which
 interactions
 of
 two
 variables
 can
 be
 added,
EY =
 ˛support +
 ˛c1 +
 ·
 ·
 ·
 +
 ˛c10 +
 ˛support,c1 +
 ·
 ·
 ·
 +
 ˛support,c10
+
 ˛c1,c2 +
 ·
 ·
 ·
 +
 ˛c9,c10,
or
 even
 interactions
 of
 more
 variables,
EY
 =
 ˛support +
 ˛c1 +
 ·
 ·
 ·
 +
 ˛c10 +
 ˛support,c1 +
 ·
 ·
 ·
 +
 ˛c9,c10
+
 ˛support,c1,c2 +
 ·
 ·
 ·.
The
 connection
 between
 analysis
 of
 variance
 and
 correlation
 is
twofold:
(i)
 If
 the
 statistical
 test
 in
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
 rejects
 the
hypothesis
 that
 a
 particular
 main
 effect
 (e.g.,
 ˛cj for
 the
compound
 cj
 in
 (15))
 can
 be
 left
 out,
 then
 this
 indicates
 a
 cor-
relation
 between
 the
 corresponding
 independent
 variable
 and
the
 dependent
 variable
 (in
 (15):
 between
 the
 fraction
 of
 cj
 and
yield).
(ii) If
 an
 application
 of
 correlation
 measures
 reveals
 that
 that
 there
is
 no
 correlation
 between
 certain
 independent
 variables
 and
the
 dependent
 variable,
 then
 the
 main
 effects
 for
 such
 indepen-
dent
 variables
 do
 not
 need
 to
 be
 included
 into
 the
 basic
 model.
Consequently,
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 data
 allows
 more
 interac-
tions
 among
 the
 remaining
 variables
 to
 be
 included
 instead
 of
those
 main
 effects.
 Statistical
 testing
 whether
 each
 of
 the
 added
interactions
 can
 be
 left
 out
 from
 the
 model
 can
 provide
 valu-
able
 information
 that
 would
 not
 be
 available
 if
 they
 were
 not
at
 ﬁrst
 included
 –
 for
 example,
 the
 information
 that
 a
 partic-
ular
 combination
 of
 active
 components
 or
 a
 combination
 of
 a
particular
 active
 component
 and
 a
 particular
 support
 tend
 to
increase
 yield
 or
 conversion.
Importantly,
 neither
 from
 (i)
 nor
 from
 (ii)
 it
 follows
 that
 a
 if
there
 is
 a
 high
 correlation
 between
 the
 dependent
 variable
 and
the
 independent
 variable
 corresponding
 to
 a
 particular
 compound
cj
 in
 the
 basic
 statistical
 model
 (15),
 then
 the
 analysis
 of
 vari-
ance
 has
 to
 reject
 the
 hypothesis
 that
 the
 main
 effect
 ˛cj can
 be
left
 out
 from
 (15).
 Indeed,
 the
 test
 takes
 into
 account
 the
 con-
text
 of
 all
 the
 independent
 variables
 corresponding
 to
 any
 of
 the
main
 effects
 in
 the
 basic
 model.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 correlation
measures
 between
 the
 dependent
 variable
 and
 the
 independent
variable
 corresponding
 to
 cj
 are
 computed
 only
 from
 values
 of
those
 two
 variables,
 ignoring
 the
 context
 of
 the
 other
 independent
variables.
B.
 Regression
 trees
 are
 regression
 models
 that,
 similarly
 to
 the
analysis
 of
 variance,
 allow
 dependent
 variables
 of
 arbitrary
 kinds
(Breiman,
 Friedman,
 Olshen,
 &
 Stone,
 1984;
 Hastie,
 Tibshirani,
 &
Friedman,
 2001).
 Their
 principle
 consists
 in
 splitting
 the
 value
 set
of
 some
 input
 variable
 into
 two
 parts
 S1 and
 S2 in
 such
 a
 way
that
 the
 sum
 of
 squared
 errors,
 based
 on
 (x1,
 y1),
 .
 .
 .,  (xn,
 yn),
 of
the
 means
 of
 the
 regression
 variable
 y
 corresponding
 to
 S1 and
S2,

xi ∈
 S1

yi −

xi ∈
 S1yi
#{i
 :
 xi ∈
 S1}
2
+

xi ∈
 S2

yi −

xi ∈
 S2yi
#{i
 :
 xi ∈
 S2}
2
(16)
is
 minimized
 over
 all
 possible
 splits
 (S1,
 S2)
 of
 the
 value
 sets
 of
 all
input
 variables.
 If
 the
 considered
 input
 variable
 is
 continuous,
 than
only
 splits
 of
 the
 form
 (S1 =
 {x
 <
 v},
 S2 =
 {x
 ≥
 v})
 for
 some
 value
 v
are
 considered.
 Both
 S1 and
 S2 are
 then
 split
 again
 in
 the
 same
 way,
possibly
 using
 different
 input
 variables.
 Such
 splitting
 continues
as
 long
 as
 needed,
 forming
 a
 hierarchy
 of
 rectangular
 areas
 in
 the
space
 of
 continuous
 input
 variables.
 The
 name
 of
 the
 method
 orig-
inated
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 such
 hierarchies
 can
 easily
 be
 visualized
as
 tree-like
 graphs.
The
 sum
 of
 squared
 errors
 in
 (16)
 is
 actually
 the
 sum
 of
 sample
variances
 of
 the
 regression
 variable
 y
 on
 the
 sets
 S1 and
 S2.
 Since
that
 sum
 is
 minimized
 over
 all
 input
 variables,
 the
 fact
 that
 a
 partic-
ular
 input
 variable
 has
 been
 selected
 in
 this
 minimization
 indicates
its
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 regression
 variable
 y.
 More
 precisely,
 it
 indi-
cates
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 selected
 variables
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 these
variables
 allow
 to
 split
 the
 input
 space
 in
 a
 way
 leading
 to
 minimal
sum
 of
 sample
 variances
 of
 y
 over
 the
 two
 parts.

Depending
 on
 the
 number
 of
 such
 splits
 that
 are
 consecutively
performed,
 trees
 of
 different
 sizes
 can
 be
 obtained.
 The
 most
 appro-
priate
 tree
 size
 is
 usually
 chosen
 using
 cross-validation.
The
 set
 of
 available
 data
 about
 catalytic
 materials
 is
 randomly
partitioned
 into
 k
 parts
 of
 approximately
 equal
 size.
 With
 each
 pos-
sible
 tree
 size,
 k
 trees
 are
 constructed,
 using
 for
 the
 construction
 of
each
 of
 them
 k
 −
 1
 parts,
 and
 leaving
 the
 remaining
 kth
 part
 (a
 dif-
ferent
 one
 for
 each
 of
 the
 k
 trees)
 to
 measure
 the
 sum
 of
 squared
errors
 of
 predictions
 by
 the
 constructed
 tree
 T:
SSE(T)
 =

xi ∈
 k-th
 part
(T(xi)
 −
 yi)2.
To
 assess
 the
 appropriateness
 of
 each
 tree
 size,
 the
 SSE
 values
are
 averaged
 over
 all
 k
 trees
 with
 that
 size.

 of

 Data
 from
 the
 synthesis
 of
 HCN
 for
 a
 case
 study
The
 correlation
 measures
 described
 in
 Section
 2,
 as
 well
 as
 their
comparison
 with
 analysis
 of
 variance
 and
 regression
 trees,
 will
 be
illustrated
 by
 a
 case
 study
 using
 data
 from
 the
 investigation
 of
 696
catalytic
 materials
 for
 the
 high-temperature
 synthesis
 of
 hydrocyanic
acid.
H4 +
 NH3 →
 HCN
 +
 H2
(17)
2NH3 →
 N2 +
 3H2.
(18)
HCN
 is
 formed
 by
 catalytic
 reaction
 of
 methane
 and
 ammo-
nia
 (17).
 The
 decomposition
 of
 ammonia
 limits
 the
 yield
 of
 the
desired
 HCN
 formation
 (18).
 The
 available
 data
 were
 obtained
through
 high-throughput
 experiments
 in
 a
 circular
 48-channel
reactor
 (Moehmel
 et
 al.,
 2008).
 In
 most
 of
 these
 experiments,
the
 composition
 of
 the
 materials
 was
 designed
 using
 a
 genetic
algorithm
 developed
 speciﬁcally
 for
 the
 optimization
 of
 solid
 cat-
alysts
 (Buyevskaya,
 Wolf,
 &
 Baerns,
 2000;
 Wolf,
 Buyevskaya,
 &
Baerns,
 2000).
 This
 fact
 makes
 the
 case
 study
 well
 representative
because
 genetic
 and
 other
 evolutionary
 algorithms
 are
 often
 used
to
 search
 appropriate
 compositions
 of
 catalysts
 for
 catalysed
 pro-
cesses
 (Baerns
 &
 Holena,
 2009;
 Mariano,
 Costa,
 Vasco
 de
 Toledo,
Melo,
 &
 Filho,
 2011).
The
 catalysed
 process,
 as
 well
 as
 composition
 and
 preparation
of
 the
 tested
 catalytic
 materials
 have
 been
 described
 in
 detail
 in
Moehmel
 et
 al.
 (2008).  Here,
 only
 those
 facts
 are
 recalled
 that
 are
important
 for
 understanding
 which
 variables
 were
 considered
 in
the
 case
 study.
All
 the
 tested
 catalysts
 consisted
 of
 a
 support
 and
 up
 to
 six
 metal
additives.
 Support
 was
 chosen
 among
 15
 materials:
 pure
 -Al2O3
(alsint),
 as
 well
 as
 the
 compounds
 AlN,
 Mo2C,
 TiB2,
 TiN,
 Nb2O3,
BN,
 ZrO2,
 Sm2O3,
 SrO,
 CaO,
 MgO,
 TiO2,
 SiC,
 and
 Si3N4,
 bound
 in
 an
alumina
 matrix.
Eleven
 metal
 additives
 were
 used
 as
 active
 elements:
 Y,
 La,
 Zr,
Mo,
 Re,
 Ir,
 Ni,
 Pt,
 Zn,
 Ag
 and
 Au.
 It
 is
 important
 to
 realize
 that
 the
fractions
 of
 these
 compounds
 are
 not
 completely
 independent
 since
their
 weight
 fractions
 sum
 up
 to
 the
 total
 weight
 fraction
 of
 the
active
 part,
 which
 was
 ﬁxed
 to
 2.2
 wt%.
As
 far
 as
 catalyst
 performance
 is
 concerned,
 the
 primary
 interest
is
 in
 HCN
 yield.
 It
 was
 calculated
 from
 the
 CH4 concentration
 and
the
 reactor
 inlet
 and
 outlet,
 assuming
 HCN
 as
 the
 only
 product.
The
 degree
 of
 conversion
 of
 NH3 was
 considered
 as
 of
 no
 interest
due
 to
 a
 low
 variability,
 the
 conversion
 of
 NH3 being
 always
 nearly
complete.
The
 inlet
 composition
 of
 the
 feed
 gas
 amounted
 to
 10.7
 vol.
 %
NH3,
 9.3
 vol.
 %
 CH4 and
 80
 vol.%
 Ar.
 The
 reaction
 temperature
 was

1373
 K.
 At
 this
 temperature,
 it
 is
 thermodynamically
 possible
 to
convert
 the
 introduced
 CH4 completely
 to
 HCN.
For
 data
 analysis,
 the
 data
 collected
 are
 described
 by
 the
 follow-
ing
 variables:
• A
 nominal
 input
 variable
 describing
 the
 support
 of
 the
 catalyst.
• Eleven
 continuous
 input
 variables
 describing
 the
 fractions
 of
 the
metal
 additives
 Y,
 La,
 Zr,
 Mo,
 Re,
 Ir,
 Ni,
 Pt,
 Zn,
 Ag,
 and
 Au
 in
 the
active
 shell
 of
 the
 catalyst.
• One
 continuous
 output
 variable
 describing
 the
 HCN
 yield.
3.1.
 Choice
 of
 support
Recall
 from
 Section
 2
 that
 the
 correlation
 measures
 can
 be
applied
 only
 to
 the
 11
 continuous
 input
 variables
 and
 the
 3
 con-
tinuous
 output
 variables.
 Nevertheless,
 there
 is
 a
 simple
 way
 how
to
 take
 into
 account
 also
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 remaining,
 nominal
variable,
 i.e.
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 support:
 to
 apply
 the
 measures
 for
each
 support
 separately.
 The
 distribution
 of
 the
 696
 tested
 cata-
lysts
 according
 to
 their
 support
 is
 depicted
 in
 Fig.
 1.
 We
 decided
to
 restrict
 the
 subsequent
 illustration
 of
 applying
 correlation
 mea-
sures
 to
 the
 supports
 Si3N4 (160
 catalysts)
 and
 SiC
 (123
 catalysts).
Fig.
 2
 shows
 how
 frequently
 catalytic
 materials
 with
 those
 two
 sup-
ports
 contain
 each
 of
 the
 11
 active
 metals.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 that,
 with
the
 exception
 of
 La
 and
 Pt
 in
 SiC-supported
 catalysts,
 each
 of
 them
was
 contained
 in
 less
 than
 50%
 of
 the
 tested
 catalytic
 materials,
though
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 Zr
 in
 Si3N4-supported
 catalysts
 and
Zr,
 Mo  in
 SiC-supported
 catalysts,
 each
 of
 them
 occurred
 in
 at
 least
10%
 of
 the
 materials.

 Case
 study
 results
 and
 discussion
The
 6
 correlation
 measures
 introduced
 in
 Section
 2
 were
 applied
data
 concerning
 the
 283
 catalytic
 materials
 supported
 by
 Si3N4 or
SiC.
 For
 each
 metal
 additive,
 the
 correlation
 measures
 were
 applied
only
 to
 those
 catalysts
 that
 contained,
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 respective
support,
 also
 the
 additive.
 The
 reason
 for
 this
 restriction
 is
 that
 most
properties
 of
 correlation
 measures
 are
 valid
 only
 if
 both
 random
variables
 for
 which
 the
 correlation
 is
 calculated
 are
 continuous.
Whereas
 it
 is
 quite
 natural
 to
 view
 values
 of
 yield
 as
 realizations
of
 a
 continuous
 random
 variable,
 this
 is
 not
 the
 case
 for
 the
 values
of
 fractions
 of
 metal
 additives
 if
 they
 should
 include
 also
 the
 value
0
 (meaning
 “that
 additive
 is
 not
 at
 all
 contained
 in
 the
 catalytic
material”).
 Indeed,
 the
 high
 number
 of
 catalysts
 not
 containing
 the
additive,
 apparent
 from
 Fig.
 2,
 would
 mean
 equally
 high
 number
of
 realizations
 equal
 0,
 which
 is
 extremely
 unlikely
 for
 a
 contin-
uous
 variable,
 even
 if
 its
 values
 have
 a
 very
 low
 discernibility.
 It
is
 much
 more
 natural
 to
 view
 the
 value
 0
 as
 the
 realization
 of
 a
discrete
 random
 variable
 describing
 whether
 the
 additive
 is
 con-
tained
 in
 the
 material
 or
 not.
 Only
 for
 the
 subpopulation
 of
 the
catalytic
 materials
 in
 which
 it
 is
 contained,
 there
 is
 a
 continuous
random
 variable
 providing
 the
 fraction
 of
 the
 considered
 additive
in
 the
 material.
 To
 achieve
 sufﬁcient
 reliability,
 correlation
 mea-
sures
 have
 been
 applied
 only
 to
 those
 additives
 that
 were
 contained
in
 at
 least
 10%
 of
 the
 investigated
 catalytic
 materials.
 These
 were
all
 additives
 except
 Zr
 (i.e.,
 10
 metal
 additives)
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Si3N4-
supported
 catalysts,
 and
 all
 additives
 except
 Zr
 and
 Mo  (i.e.,
 9
 metal
additives)
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Si3C-supported
 catalysts.
4.1.
 Correlation
 results
 for
 Si3N4-supported
 catalysts,
 with
discussion
The
 results
 for
 catalytic
 materials
 with
 support
 Si3N4 are
depicted
 in
 Fig.
 4.
 They
 can
 be
 described
 as
 follows:
(a)
 The
 fraction
 of
 Pt
 has
 a
 positive
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
according
 to
 all
 measures
 except
 medial
 correlation
 coefﬁcient.
In
 all
 such
 cases,
 the
 correlation
 of
 its
 fraction
 is
 also
 the
 highest
positive
 one.
 In
 addition,
 the
 fraction
 of
 Ir
 has
 consistently
 a
 low
positive
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 (including
 medial
 corre-
lation
 coefﬁcient),
 and
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 linear
 correlation
coefﬁcient,
 the
 same
 is
 also
 true
 for
 the
 fraction
 of
 Au.
 There-
fore,
 also
 an
 increasing
 molar
 fraction
 of
 these
 two
 elements
might
 improve
 HCN
 yield.
 Moreover,
 the
 values
 of
 the
 corre-
lation
 measures,
 most
 importantly
 the
 values
 of
 the
 Schweizer
and
 Wolff’s
 measure,
 which
 reﬂects
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 corre-
lation
 between
 a
 molar
 fraction
 and
 the
 HCN
 yield
 (cf.
 Section
2),
 imply
 that
 the
 positive
 impact
 of
 the
 Pt
 molar
 fraction
 on
 the
HCN
 yield
 is
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 the
 Au
 or
 Ir
 molar
 fraction.
(b)
 The
 most
 negative
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 according
 to
the
 correlations
 measures
 indicating
 the
 direction
 of
 correla-
tion
 (all
 measures
 except
 the
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s,
 cf.
 Section
2)
 was
 obtained
 for
 the
 fractions
 of
 elements
 Y,
 Ni,
 Zn
 and
Ag.
 Moreover,
 the
 fractions
 of
 Y,
 Ni,
 Zn
 and
 Ag
 have
 also
 the
highest
 intensity
 of
 correlation
 according
 to
 the
 Schweizer
 and
Wolff’s
 measure.
 Those
 facts
 indicate
 that
 catalyst
 compositions
with
 high
 molar
 fraction
 of
 these
 elements
 should
 be
 avoided,
whereas
 small
 molar
 fractions
 of
 them
 have
 a
 positive
 inﬂuence
on
 the
 HCN
 yield.
 Consequently,
 Y,
 Ni,
 Zn
 and
 Ag
 may
 act
 as
 pro-
moters,
 which
 is
 in
 agreement
 with
 ﬁndings
 in
 Moehmel
 et
 al.
(2008).
(c)
 The
 fractions
 of
 La,
 Mo  and
 Re
 have
 less
 negative
 correlation
with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 than
 the
 fractions
 of
 Y,
 Ni,
 Zn
 and
 Ag,
 and
 also
the
 intensity
 of
 their
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 according
to
 the
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure
 is
 lower.
 Therefore,
 the
negative
 inﬂuence
 of
 high
 molar
 fraction
 of
 these
 elements
 on
the
 HCN
 yield
 is
 low,
 and
 their
 fraction
 in
 catalysts
 with
 a
 high
HCN
 yield
 can
 be
 larger
 compared
 to
 Y,
 Ni,
 Zn
 and
 Ag.
 Indeed,
in
 one
 of
 the
 catalysts
 with
 highest
 yield
 reported
 in
 Moehmel
et
 al.
 (2008),  the
 fraction
 of
 Re
 was
 36%.

 Correlation
 results
 for
 SiC-supported
 catalysts,
 with
discussion
Similarly,
 the
 results
 for
 SiC-supported
 materials,
 depicted
 in
Fig.
 5,
 can
 be
 described
 as
 follows:

 Percentiles
 of
 HCN
 yield
 values
 in
 catalytic
 materials
 with
 supports
 Si3N4 and
 SiC
 and
 metal
 additives
 except
 Zr
 and
 Mo.
(a)
 Positive
 correlation
 of
 the
 molar
 fraction
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 for
catalysts
 with
 support
 SiC
 was
 found
 for
 the
 elements
 Pt
 and
Au
 using
 the
 Spearman’s,
 Kendall’s
 and
 Gini’s
 correlation
 coef-
ﬁcient.
 As
 was
 the
 case
 for
 catalysts
 with
 support
 Si3N4,
 the
linear
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 is
 positive,
 but
 the
 medial
 correla-
tion
 coefﬁcient
 is
 negative
 for
 the
 fraction
 of
 Pt.
 In
 contrast,
 both
the
 linear
 and
 the
 medial
 correlation
 coefﬁcient
 are
 negative
for
 the
 fraction
 of
 Au.
 The
 values
 of
 the
 correlations
 measures
indicating
 the
 direction
 of
 correlation,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 intensity
of
 correlation
 according
 to
 the
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure
show
 that
 the
 molar
 fraction
 of
 Pt
 has
 a
 dominating
 positive
inﬂuence
 on
 the
 HCN
 yield.
 Compared
 to
 Pt,
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
molar
 fraction
 of
 Au
 is
 only
 marginal.
(b)
 The
 most
 negative
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 according
to
 the
 correlations
 measures
 indicating
 the
 direction
 of
 cor-
relation
 was
 obtained
 for
 the
 fractions
 of
 Re,
 Ni
 ad
 Zn,
 which
have
 also
 the
 highest
 intensity
 of
 correlation
 according
 to
 the
Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure.
 Therefore,
 high
 molar
 fraction
of
 these
 elements
 should
 be
 avoided.
 Recall
 that
 a
 strong
 nega-
tive
 correlation
 between
 the
 fraction
 of
 Ni
 and
 Zn
 and
 the
 HCN
yield
 was
 observed
 already
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Si3N4-supported
 cata-
lysts.
 It
 might
 be
 concluded
 that
 independently
 of
 the
 support,
high
 molar
 fraction
 of
 those
 two
 elements
 is
 inappropriate
 for
achieving
 high
 HCN
 yield.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 strong
 nega-
tive
 correlation
 between
 the
 fractions
 of
 Re,
 Ni,
 Zn
 and
 the
 HCN
yield
 implies
 also
 that
 the
 presence
 of
 these
 elements
 in
 low
molar
 fractions
 has
 a
 positive
 inﬂuence
 on
 the
 HCN
 yield.
(c)
 The
 fractions
 of
 La,
 Ir
 and
 Ag
 have
 less
 negative
 correlation
 with
the
 HCN
 yield
 than
 the
 fractions
 of
 Re,
 Ni
 and
 Zn,
 and
 also
the
 intensity
 of
 their
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 accord-
ing
 to
 the
 Schweizer
 and
 Wolff’s
 measure
 is
 lower.
 Therefore,
it
 is
 expected
 that
 the
 fraction
 of
 La,
 Ir
 and
 Ag
 in
 cata-
lysts
 with
 a
 high
 HCN
 yield
 can
 be
 larger
 compared
 to
 Re,
Ni
 and
 Zn.

 Comparison
 with
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
In
 Moehmel
 et
 al.
 (2008),  analysis
 of
 variance
 of
 the
 HCN
 yield
was
 performed
 using
 data
 about
 all
 696
 catalytic
 materials.
 For
comparison
 with
 the
 application
 of
 correlation
 measures,
 we

 Correlations
 between
 fractions
 of
 metal
 additives
 and
 HCN
 yield
 for
 catalytic

 Si3N4 and
 the
 10
 additives
 contained
 in
 at
 least
 10%
 such
 materials.
performed
 it
 only
 with
 data
 about
 the
 283
 materials
 supported
 by
Si3N4 or
 SiC,
 separately
 for
 each
 of
 those
 supports.
 Moreover,
 the
choice
 of
 independent
 variables
 differs
 from
 Moehmel
 et
 al.
 (2008)
in
 two
 respects:
(i)
 Since
 support
 is
 now
 the
 same
 for
 all
 materials
 in
 each
 of
 the
performed
 analyses
 of
 variance,
 it
 does
 not
 any
 more
 serve
 as
an
 independent
 variable.
(ii)
 In
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
 in
 Moehmel
 et
 al.
 (2008),  the
 metal
additives
 were
 described
 with
 2-valued
 independent
 variables
that
 only
 indicate
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 respective
 additive
 in
the
 catalyst.
 Needless
 to
 say,
 those
 independent
 variables
 sub-
stantially
 differ
 from
 the
 fractions
 of
 individual
 additives
 in
 the
material,
 which
 are
 used
 in
 the
 calculations
 of
 correlation
 mea-
sures.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 it
 is
 not
 possible
 to
 use
 directly
 those
fractions
 as
 independent
 variables
 in
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
because
 they
 can
 have
 many
 different
 values
 in
 the
 data
 (the-
oretically
 as
 many
 as
 the
 number
 of
 considered
 catalysts)
 and
would
 impose
 more
 parameters
 to
 the
 basic
 statistical
 model
underlying
 the
 analysis
 than
 can
 be
 estimated
 from
 the
 data
 (in
statistical
 terms,
 they
 would
 add
 too
 many

 the

 Therefore,
 we
 used
 auxiliary
 variables
 as
 inde-
pendent
 variables
 describing
 the
 metal
 additives
 in
 the
 analysis
of
 variance,
 each
 of
 which
 adds
 at
 most
 5
 degrees
 of
 freedom
to
 the
 basic
 statistical
 model,
 at
 the
 same
 time
 attempting
 to
mimic
 the
 behaviour
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
 the
 respective
 metal
additive.
 For
 a
 metal
 additive
 a,
 such
 an
 auxiliary
 independent
variable
 Xa was
 deﬁned
 as
 follows:
1. If
 the
 set
 of
 values
 of
 the
 fraction
 of
 a,
 Fa,
 in
 data
 has
 at
 most
5
 elements,
{Fa(x)

 ≤
 5,
where
 C
 denotes
 the
 set
 of
 considered
 catalysts
 (thus
 C
 has
160
 elements
 if
 support
 is
 Si3N4,
 and
 123
 elements
 if

 then
Xa(x)
 =

The
 results
 of
 the
 analysis
 are
 listed
 in
 Table
 1.
 In
 Si3N4-
supported
 catalysts,
 Pt,
 Ir
 and
 Mo
 were
 signiﬁcant
 at
 the
 1%
 level
 of
signiﬁcance
 (i.e.,
 highly
 signiﬁcant),
 whereas
 Ni
 and
 Ag
 were
 sig-
niﬁcant
 only
 at
 the
 5%
 level
 but
 not
 at
 the
 1%
 level.
 In
 SiC-supported
catalysts,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 Pt,
 Au,
 were
 signiﬁcant
 at
 the
 1%
 level
 in
SiC-supported
 catalysts.
 Observe
 that
 for
 SiC-supported
 catalysts,
the
 achieved
 signiﬁcance
 is
 much
 lower
 than
 for
 catalysts
 with
 sup-
port
 Si3N4.
 Therefore,
 it
 can
 be
 assumed
 that
 the
 interaction
 of
 Pt
with
 SiC
 is
 lower
 than
 its
 interaction
 with
 Si3N4.
There
 is
 one
 clear
 correspondence
 between
 the
 results
 of
 anal-
ysis
 of
 variance
 and
 results
 obtained
 with
 correlation
 methods:
The
 fraction
 of
 Pt,
 which
 is
 in
 combination
 with
 both
 considered
supports
 the
 most
 signiﬁcant
 metal
 additive
 at
 all
 (achieved
 signif-
icance
 10−12 in
 Si3N4-supported
 catalysts,
 10−5 in
 SiC-supported
catalysts),
 has
 also
 irrespectively
 of
 support
 the
 highest
 positive
correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield,
 according
 to
 all
 measures
 except
medial
 correlation
 coefﬁcient.
On
 the
 other
 hand,
 this
 is
 also
 the
 only
 unquestionable
 corre-
spondence.
 Whereas
 the
 fractions
 of
 the
 metal
 additives
 Ni
 and
 Ag,
which
 are
 signiﬁcant
 in
 Si3N4-supported
 catalysts,
 have
 in
 those
catalysts
 a
 high
 intensity
 of
 correlation
 according
 to
 Schweizer
 and
Wolff’s
 measure,
 the
 same
 is
 not
 true
 for
 the
 fractions
 of
 the
 highly
signiﬁcant
 additives
 Mo  and
 Ir
 in
 Si3N4-supported
 catalysts,
 nei-
ther
 for
 the
 fractions
 of
 the
 highly
 signiﬁcant
 Au
 in
 SiC-supported
catalysts.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 fraction
 of
 Ni
 has
 a
 high
 intensity
of
 correlation
 also
 in
 SiC-supported
 catalysts,
 although
 Ni
 is
 not
 at
all
 signiﬁcant
 in
 them
 (achieved
 signiﬁcance
 0.37).
Sometimes,
 a
 new
 insight
 into
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 catalyst
 compo-
sition
 on
 the
 HCN
 yield
 can
 be
 obtained
 through
 combining
 results
obtained
 using
 correlation
 measures
 with
 the
 results
 of
 analysis
of
 variance.
 For
 example,
 the
 very
 high
 signiﬁcance
 of
 Ir
 in
 Si3N4-
supported
 catalysts,
 combined
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 fraction
 of
Ir
 has
 a
 low
 positive
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 in
 that
 case,
indicates
 that
 for
 most
 of
 the
 possible
 values
 of
 the
 above
 deﬁned
auxiliary
 variable
 XIr,
 the
 variance
 of
 the
 HCN
 yield
 is
 quite
 low.
 Con-
sequently,
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 fractions
 of
 the
 remaining
 elements
is
 mostly
 low
 once
 the
 fraction
 of
 Ir
 is
 ﬁxed.
 For
 similar
 reasons,
the
 variance
 of
 the
 HCN
 yield
 is
 quite
 low
 for
 most
 of
 the
 possible
values
 of
 the
 above
 deﬁned
 auxiliary
 variable
 XAu in
 the
 case
 of
 SiC-
supported
 catalysts.
 In
 such
 catalysts
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 the
 fractions
of
 the
 remaining
 elements
 is
 thus
 mostly
 low
 once
 the
 fraction
 of
Au
 is
 ﬁxed.

 Comparison
 with
 the
 application
 of
 regression
 trees
Also
 a
 regression
 tree
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield
 as
 dependent
 variable
was
 for
 the
 HCN
 data
 constructed
 already
 in
 Moehmel
 et
 al.
 (2008),
taking
 into
 account
 all
 696
 catalytic
 materials.
 For
 comparison
with
 the
 application
 of
 correlation
 measures,
 we  now
 constructed
regression
 trees
 using
 only
 data
 about
 the
 283
 materials
 to
 which
they
 were
 applied,
 a
 separate
 tree
 for
 each
 support.
 We

 Matlab
 implementation
 of
 the
 original
 regression
 trees
 pro-
posed
 in
 Breiman
 et
 al.
 (1984),  putting
 a
 single
 restriction
 on
 the
resulting
 trees,
 namely
 the
 minimal
 size
 of
 data
 in
 leafs
 to
 be
 10.
The
 constructed
 regression
 tree
 for
 Si3N4-supported
 catalytic
materials
 is
 visualized
 in
 Fig.
 6.
 Observe
 that
 the
 primary
 split
 is
according
 to
 the
 fraction
 of
 Pt,
 and
 the
 secondary
 splits
 for
 catalysts
with
 lower
 fractions
 of
 Pt
 according
 to
 the
 fraction
 of
 Ir,
 whereas
for
 those
 with
 higher
 fractions
 of
 Pt
 once
 again
 according
 to
 the
fraction
 of
 Pt.
 The
 tertiary
 splits
 are
 according
 to
 the
 fractions
 of
Mo, Zn,
 once
 again
 Ir,
 and
 Au.
 The
 regression
 tree
 shows
 that
 on
 the
Si3N4 support,
 especially
 the
 combination
 of
 Pt
 with
 the
 elements
Au
 and
 Pt
 can
 give
 high
 HCN
 yield.
 Furthermore,
 that
 fact
 that
 Pt
determines
 the
 primary
 and
 one
 secondary
 split,
 and
 that
 Ir
 deter-
mines
 one
 secondary
 and
 one
 tertiary
 split,
 imply
 a
 great
 impact
 of
those
 two
 elements
 on
 HCN
 formation,
 a
 conclusion
 supported
 also
by
 high
 signiﬁcance
 of
 those
 elements
 according
 to
 the
 analysis
 of
variance.
The
 regression
 tree
 for
 SiC-supported
 catalysts
 is
 visualized
 in
Fig.
 7.
 Its
 smaller
 size
 (i.e.,
 lower
 number
 of
 nodes)
 compared
 to
 the
tree
 for
 Si3N4-supported
 catalysts
 is
 a
 consequence
 of
 the
 different
number
 of
 catalysts
 with
 both
 kinds
 of
 support
 in
 the
 available
 data.
Also
 for
 SiC-supported
 catalysts,
 the
 primary
 split
 is
 according
 to
the
 fraction
 of
 Pt,
 and
 the
 secondary
 splits
 according
 to
 the
 fraction
of
 Ir
 for
 catalysts
 with
 lower
 fractions
 of
 Pt,
 and
 again
 according
 to
the
 fraction
 of
 Pt
 for
 those
 with
 higher
 fractions
 of
 Pt.
 The
 tertiary
splits
 are,
 for
 this
 support,
 only
 according
 to
 fractions
 of
 two
 ele-
ments:
 Zn
 and
 Au.
 The
 regression
 tree
 shows
 that
 also
 for
 the
 SiC
support,
 the
 addition
 of
 further
 elements,
 here
 in
 particular
 Ir
 and
Au,
 can
 lead
 to
 high
 HCN
 yield.
Also
 for
 regression
 trees,
 like
 for
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance,
 a
 clear
correspondence
 with
 the
 results
 obtained
 with
 correlation
 meth-
ods
 can
 be
 found
 only
 in
 emphasizing
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 fraction
of
 Pt.
 That
 fraction
 determines
 not
 only
 the
 primary
 splits
 of
 HCN
yield
 and
 of
 the
 conversion
 of
 CH4,
 but
 also
 the
 secondary
 splits
 in
the
 branches
 corresponding
 to
 higher
 values.
 In
 Si3N4-supported
catalysts,
 two
 more
 fractions
 determining
 splits
 at
 the
 ﬁrst
 three
levels
 of
 the
 tree,
 the
 fractions
 of
 Ir
 and
 Au,
 tend
 to
 have
 a
 pos-
itive
 correlation
 with
 the
 HCN
 yield.
 The
 fraction
 of
 Ir
 is

 Conclusions
In
 the
 paper,
 the
 methodology
 of
 computing
 the
 correlations
between
 continuous
 descriptors
 of
 catalytic
 materials
 and
 their
performance
 in
 the
 catalysed
 process
 was
 addressed.
 In
 particu-
lar,
 descriptor-wise
 application
 of
 various
 correlation
 measures
 for
computing
 those
 correlations
 was
 proposed.
 The
 paper
 also
 pointed
out
 the
 similarities
 and
 dissimilarities
 between
 the
 results
 obtained
by
 the
 application
 of
 correlation
 measures
 to
 catalytic
 data,
 and
those
 obtained
 by
 two
 other
 approaches,
 based
 on
 different
 prin-
ciples:
 the
 analysis
 of
 variance
 and
 the
 application
 of
 regression
trees.
The
 presented
 methods
 were
 illustrated
 by
 a
 detailed
 case
 study
using
 data
 from
 high-temperature
 synthesis
 of
 HCN
 (Moehmel
et
 al.,
 2008),
 which
 has
 shown
 that
 correlation
 measures
 can
 help
 to
increase
 our
 insight
 into
 the
 behaviour
 of
 the
 tested
 catalytic
 mate-
rials
 in
 the
 considered
 reaction.
 It
 has
 also
 shown
 that
 an
 additional
insight
 into
 the
 inﬂuence
 of
 individual
 components
 of
 a
 catalytic
material
 on
 its
 properties
 can
 be
 obtained
 through
 combining
 the
results
 of
 different
 approaches.
 The
 metal
 additives
 that
 were,
 in
this
 case
 study,
 found
 most
 important
 for
 HCN
 yield
 by
 the
 correla-
tion
 measures
 and
 by
 the
 two
 other
 approaches
 were
 discussed
 in
detail
 in
 Section
 4.
 They
 are
 now
 once
 more
 summarized
 in
 Table
 2.
The
 ﬁndings
 of
 the
 case
 study
 are
 in
 agreement
 with
 existing
knowledge
 about
 HCN
 synthesis.
 The
 catalytic
 components
 should
be
 suited
 for
 breaking
 hydrogen–carbon
 bonds
 of
 methane
 as
 well
as
 hydrogen–nitrogen
 bonds
 from
 ammonia.
 The
 remaining
 CHx
and
 NHx should
 then
 couple
 on
 the
 surface
 resulting
 ﬁnally
 in
 HCN.
M.
 Diefenbach,
 Brönstrup,
 Aschi,
 Schröder,
 and
 Schwarz
 (1999)
have
 shown
 in
 experimental
 and
 computational
 studies
 that
 C
 N
bond
 formation
 is
 mediated
 by
 Pt+.
 CH4 is
 ﬁrst
 dehydrogenated
 to
PtAuCH2+ while
 dehydrogenation
 of
 ammonia
 does
 not
 occur
 on
Pt
 due
 to
 its
 endothermicity.
 The
 major
 pathway
 is
 found
 via
 PtH
and
 CH2NH2+.
 Compared
 to
 other
 transition
 metal
 cations
 like
 Fe*,
Co+,
 Rh+,
 W+,
 Os+,
 Ir+ and
 Au+,
 Pt+ is
 assumed
 to
 be
 unique
 for
 its
ability
 to
 activate
 methane
 and
 to
 mediate
 C
 N
 bond
 formation
 as
a
 precursor
 for
 HCN.
 According
 to
 the
 present
 results
 it
 is
 likely
 that
also
 Ir,
 Au,
 and
 Re
 as
 well
 as
 possibly
 Mo  facilitate
 HCN
 formation
in
 a
 similar
 manner.
 In
 a
 later
 paper,
 Koszinowski,
 Schröder,
 and
Schwarz
 (2004)
 argued
 that
 CN
 coupling
 of
 methane
 and
 ammonia
might
 occur
 on
 PtmAun+ clusters;
 however,
 they
 proved
 only
 that
the
 binuclear
 carbene
 complex
 PtAuCH2+ mediates
 C
 N
 formation.
Au
 itself
 was
 shown
 not

 This
 is
 not
 in
 contradic-
tion
 to
 the
 present
 work,
 in
 which
 Pt
 and
 a
 support
 was
 present
in
 the
 catalytic
 reaction.
 Tentatively,
 it
 may
 be
 assumed
 that
 also
Ir
 and
 Re
 follow
 similar
 mechanisms
 for
 the
 mechanisms
 of
 the
HCN-formation
 reaction.
