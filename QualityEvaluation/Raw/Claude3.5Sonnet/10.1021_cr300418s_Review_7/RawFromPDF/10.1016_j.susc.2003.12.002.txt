Abstract
Oxygen nonstoichiometry of nanocrystalline ceria powder with a particle size of about 12 nm was measured by
thermogravimetric techniques as a function of temperature, oxygen partial pressure and synthetic route. The measured
oxygen release/uptake from the samples under isothermal or isobaric conditions applied in this study are found to be
predominantly due to variations in the surface nonstoichiometry. Its oxygen partial pressure dependence indicates the
presence of surface oxygen vacancies in diﬀerent ionization states in addition to segregated impurities.

1. Introduction
The investigation of oxygen storage in nano-
crystalline ceria (n-CeO2d) is of double interest.
Firstly, since ceria is a model mixed conductor
with a simple structure and a simple bulk defect
chemistry, it should provide a more detailed in-
sight into the defect chemistry of oxide surfaces in
general. In particular, in the surface science com-
munity, not very much attention is paid to defect
chemistry which does not only govern bulk and
sub-surface properties but also the surface prop-
erties such as catalytic activity [1]. Secondly, the
results may serve to test the space charge model for
n-CeO2d recently proposed on the basis of con-
ductivity experiments [1,2]. It was noticed that
nominally pure nanocrystalline ceria (n-CeO2d)
ceramics showed a signiﬁcantly enhanced n-type
overall conductivity even under conditions under
which the bulk is expected to be ionically con-
ducting [2–5]. The following core-space charge
picture [6] explains this: The grain boundary core
in n-CeO2d ceramics is positively charged (this is
also proposed for coarse-grained ceria [7]) result-
ing in accumulating electrons (e0) and depleting
oxygen vacancies (V 
O) simultaneously in the vicin-
ity of the interface (viz. space charge zones). As a
result, the space charge zones become extremely
conductive for e0, while highly resistive for V 
O.
This leads to enhanced electronic and depressed
ionic conductivities as conﬁrmed in detail in Ref.
[2].
Unclear is the source of the positive excess
charge in the grain boundary core. One possi-
bility is the segregation of dopants. As long as
the
electron
accumulation
is
not
severe
in
absolute carrier numbers (even though severe in
terms of conductivity) we do not have to worry
about the source of the accumulated conduction

electrons, they may stem from minor valence
charges of the segregants or of oxygen ions in the
surface layer.
The surface charge may even exclusively stem
from native eﬀects, viz. from oxygen vacancies
[7]: It is intelligible and known from computa-
tion that the formation energy for V 
O and e0 is
reduced at the surface [8]. Owing to the rela-
tively low measurement temperatures of 350–500
C, we do not only expect an increased vacancy
concentration there but we also expect the mean
charge to be depressed as a consequence of
association (that the eﬀective charge of oxygen
ions at the surface is closer to )1 than to )2 is
simply eﬀected by the reduced cation coordina-
tion). Porat et al. reported the oxygen partial
pressure (PO2) dependence of d in n-CeO2d (10
nm) measured (at 405–455 C and PO2 ¼ 0:1–10
Pa) by coulometric titration to obey a )1/2
power law (which may be compared with the
)1/6 power found for the conductivity [4]) that
they attributed to either neutral adsorption of
oxygen molecules or atomic incorporation into
neutral oxygen vacancies, formed by association
at the surface layer [9]. Knauth and Tuller, on
the other hand, observed d / P 1=3
O2
for Pr-doped
n-CeO2d (35 nm) at 470 C and d / P 1=6
O2
at 540 and 640 C [10]. They also considered the
exponent of )1/3 measured at lower temperature
to largely stem from defect association of e0 and
V 
O. Their quantitative interpretation
assumed
electroneutrality in the surface layer which does
not seem to be fulﬁlled according to the detailed
electrical measurements mentioned above [2].
In this contribution we present studies on oxy-
gen nonstoichiometry in n-CeO2d powder as a
function of PO2, temperature and synthesis condi-
tions by using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
combined with mass spectroscopy (MS). We will
semi-quantitatively
discuss
the
measured
PO2
dependence of nonstoichiometry within the core-
space charge model.
2. Experimental
n-CeO2d powder was synthesized in two dif-
ferent ways for comparison: On one hand it was
precipitated from aqueous Ce(NO3)3 Æ 6H2O (Al-
drich, 99.99%) solution by dilute ammonia at
room temperature (n-CeO2d [A]); on the other
hand
it
was
directly
produced
by
thermally
decomposing
Ce(NO3)3 Æ 6H2O
at
350
C
(n-
CeO2d [B]). The particle size of the as-synthe-
sized powders was about 8 nm (for details, see
Ref. [2]). Before TG experiments, the sample
powder was pre-annealed at 600 C for 2 h
to remove any volatile species in the sample
(leading to a BET surface of approximately 80
m2/g corresponding to a grain size of about 12
nm).
TG
measurements
were
performed
with
a
NETZSCH STA 449 thermobalance coupled by
a heated glass capillary to a BALZERS Prisma
mass spectrometer. The typical sample weight
was 3–4 g, and the purge gas ﬂow (O2/N2 mix-
tures) 30 ml/min. In isothermal runs, the weight
change after stepwise increase of PO2 was re-
corded. After about 10 min the gas exchange
around
the
sample
was
completed
and
the
weight stabilized at its new value. Under such
circumstances, weight diﬀerences of typically 10–
20 lg can still be measured reliably. The errors
in measurements are expected to increase with
increasing PO2, since weight changes in the sam-
ple decrease while the buoyancy eﬀects, that
have to be corrected for, increase. In order to
minimize weight eﬀects due to ﬂuctuations of the
water partial pressure in the purge gas [11], a
constant water partial pressure of 200 ppm was
established.
Buoyancy
corrections
were
done
with inert, coarse grained SiO2 reference mate-
rial. The conversion of the weight diﬀerences
measured by TG to absolute d is not indepen-
dent from the assumed defect model and is dis-
cussed in more detail below. The maximum
possible measurement temperature (no particle
growth within 4 h) was found to be about
500 C.
The amount of released/taken-up oxygen upon
isobaric stepwise temperature changes was, on the
other hand, calculated from a quantitative analysis
of the MS oxygen signal, since the total weight
changes of the sample in these conditions were
dominated
rather
by
the
water
desorption/
adsorption [11].

3. Results and discussion
For the sake of clarity we distinguish, in the
following, between two diﬀerent processes of oxy-
gen release/uptake of n-CeO2d, namely: (i) molec-
ular oxygen adsorption/desorption, (ii) atomic
oxygen incorporation/excorporation into bulk or
surface layer, and only (ii) is considered to be
responsible for d.
In order to investigate how far the molecular
oxygen adsorption/desorption contributes to the
observed oxygen uptake/release of n-CeO2d in the
temperature range of interest, a sample of n-
CeO2d [B] is heated dynamically up to 500 C (see
Fig. 1). The oxygen release is found to start at
about 300 C (while the water release begins al-
ready at about 200 C, indicating that the trans-
port of released species to the MS is suﬃciently
fast so that the observed oxygen release tempera-
ture of 300 C is determined by the sample prop-
erties and not by transport limitations in the
experimental setup). This strongly indicates the
observed oxygen release/uptake not to be caused
by the molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption: In
the case of thermodesorption measurements on
alumina-supported ceria, oxygen release was ob-
served to start at about 400 C [12], or 300 C [13],
and from isotope exchange experiments it was
concluded that this oxygen was evolved from the
lattice. On the other hand, after O2 adsorption on
reduced TiO2(1 1 0) surfaces, a thermal desorption
peak at the much lower temperature of 410 K was
interpreted as removal of adsorbed molecular
oxygen species, presumably O
2 [14]. We can, thus,
reasonably ignore molecular adsorption eﬀects in
dðDdÞ of n-CeO2d under the conditions indicated.
From a quantitative analysis of the m ¼ 32 MS
data, the total amount of released oxygen is esti-
mated to correspond to a fraction of 2 · 104
(relative to all oxygen atoms in the sample).
Fig. 2 shows the MS signals of O2 released from
two diﬀerently prepared samples (n-CeO2d [A,B])
during
fast
(10
K/min)
stepwise
temperature
changes at PO2 ¼ 15 Pa in the purge gas. For both
samples, the oxygen release upon temperature in-
crease is reversible as demonstrated by the oxygen
uptake during cooling. The oxygen release from
a
similar
amount
of
microcrystalline
CeO2d
(99.999%, Aldrich, BET surface 10 m2/g, particle
size 100 nm), on the other hand, amounts to less
than one tenth of that of n-CeO2d, indicating that,
indeed, the surface is predominantly responsible
for a measured d in n-CeO2d, which is consistent
with theoretical calculations [6]. This is also con-
ﬁrmed by the fact that isothermal PO2 changes of
the microcrystalline sample yield weight changes
that come close to the detection limit (including
the buoyancy corrections).

Let us now consider the PO2 dependence of d for
the nanocrystalline samples. For both n-CeO2d
[A] and n-CeO2d [B] we measured the d evolution
upon isothermal PO2 changes as shown in Figs. 3
and 4a. Fig. 3 shows the data measured for n-
CeO2d [A]. The vertical distance of the individual
isotherms was calculated from the quantitative
analysis of the experiments shown in Fig. 2. In
order to calibrate the measurements with respect
to absolute stoichiometries, the whole set of curves
was shifted vertically to achieve d  0 for the
lowest temperature. The so-obtained data can be
ﬁtted by a straight line in the log–log plot (Fig.
3b), corresponding to a power-law dependence of
d on PO2 (d / P n
O2 ) with the measured average
exponent (n) of PO2 dependence being )0.28 ± 0.02
(skipping the less reliable data at 350 C), which is
not far from the value of )1/3 previously reported
by Porat et al. [9].
The data for n-CeO2d [B] are shown in Fig. 4a.
Again the vertical distances were calculated from
the oxygen uptake/release experiments in Fig. 2.
Interestingly this sample shows a signiﬁcantly
higher d than observed for n-CeO2d [A]. More-
over, the PO2 dependence exhibits an unexpected
linear dependence in the semi-log plot (Fig. 4a)
with the consequence of systematic deviations
from a straight line in the log–log plot. The linear
behaviour in the semi-log plot makes it diﬃcult to
determine the absolute position of the set of indi-
vidual isotherms on the ordinate, because there is
no ‘‘ﬂattening’’ at high PO2 which could indicate
the position of a common zero point. As a result,
the set of curves was tentatively shifted such
that the intersection point of the various linear
regression lines in Fig. 4a comes close to d  0
(which is at 107 Pa) This is justiﬁed in more detail
in Appendix A which takes account of the fact that
the surface generally exhibits a net charge. If linear
regression lines are drawn in the log–log plot de-
spite the systematic deviations of the data points,
an average exponent of the PO2 dependence of
)0.11 is found. Of course this value varies when
the set of curves is positioned diﬀerently along the
ordinate, reaching e.g. a value of )0.13 when d  0
is fulﬁlled for the lowest temperature at PO2 ¼ 105
Pa. Regardless of this uncertainty, the PO2 depen-
dence is signiﬁcantly less pronounced in this sam-
ple compared to the n-CeO2d [A] sample with
similar particle size. This may indicate that not
only particle size but also preparation conditions
(e.g. surface morphology and maybe also the
amount and type of impurities segregated onto the
surface) play a decisive role in the surface state of

n-CeO2d prepared at relatively moderate temper-
atures. In fact, for ceria, the stabilization energies
of V 
O at the surface were calculated to vary from
0.4 to 2.5 eV depending upon the surface orien-
tation [8]. It is obvious that the exponents of the
measured
PO2
dependence
are
more
strongly
inﬂuenced by the synthetic and ambient conditions
than the typical values expected for bulk defect
chemistry.
In order to understand such measured PO2 de-
pendences, we ﬁrst take the following into con-
sideration: As demonstrated in Ref. [2] for grain
boundaries, the surface of the particles is consid-
ered to be positively charged. Note that, in view of
the conductivity studies of n-CeO2d [2], we can
expect the surface charge to be much greater than
the Dd therein (Rs=zF  Dd, R, z and F denote the
surface charge density, the charge number and
Faraday constant, respectively). As a source, we
assume segregated impurities of charge z ¼ a (Aa
s ,
the subscript s indicates the surface) together with
oxygen vacancies that, according to the above
considerations, should exhibit an eﬀective charge
z ¼ e distinctively smaller than )2. The mean va-
lence e of oxygen vacancies may be constituted by
the simultaneous occurrence of V 
O, V 
O and V x
O (V 
O
and V x
O are singly- and uncharged oxygen vacancies,
respectively). For simplicity and as an approxima-
tion, we lump them together by assuming a mean
representative species V e
Os. We now distinguish two
extreme cases in which Rs is predominantly deter-
mined by either V e
Os or Aa
s . Then we have to con-
sider the following two cases:
Case 1: The surface charge is established by
oxygen vacancies, i.e. ½V e
Os  ½Aa
s . Since now
Dd  ½V e
Os ¼ R=eF , it simply follows that the rel-
ative variation of d is negligible:
olnd=olnPO2  0:

Case 2: The surface charge is established by the
impurities for which we roughly assume a ﬁxed
valence: ½Aa
s  ¼ R=aF , i.e. ½V e
Os  ½Aa
s .
In this case we proceed as follows: The defect

charge potential including the potential drop from
surface to the bulk space charge layer. Ks1 is the
purely chemical constant of the reaction (2).
As D/s1 is essentially determined by the invari-
ant impurity segregation, it can be considered to be
PO2 independent. Consequently, we now obtain
from Eq. (3) that
oln½V e
Os=olnPO2 ¼ 1=2 þ e=4
ð4Þ
since oln½e0
1=olnPO2 ¼ 1=4, as obtained from
the electrical measurements [2]. Obviously Eq. (4)
predicts the slope to be zero if only V 
O is present,
and to be )1/2 if all the vacancies were neutral. (In
this case the result is more rigorous since the
electrical ﬁeld factor in Eq. (3) disappears.)
Let us now interpret olnd=olnPO2 measured for
n-CeO2d [A] and n-CeO2d [B] found to be )0.28
and )0.11, respectively. First of all, the non-zero
dependencies suggest that the R is essentially
determined by Aa
s , i.e. we refer to case 2. The
measured value of )0.28 for n-CeO2d [A] corre-
sponds to e  0:9 which indicate that the majority
defect in the sample is V 
Os with some minor frac-
tion of V x
O (the same is true then for the slope of
)1/3 measured by Knauth and Tuller [10]), while
the value of )0.11 for n-CeO2d [B] corresponding
to e  1:5 suggesting the majority defects to be V 
Os
and V 
Os. The slope of )1/2 measured by Porat et al.
[9], on the other hand, obviously corresponds to
e  0, indicating the majority defect to be V x
O. As
already pointed out the scatter is not unexpected
and may be even further interpreted in terms of
experimental conditions.
In Fig. 4b the temperature dependence of d is
shown (at PO2 ¼ 15 Pa, positioning on the ordinate
as in Figs. 3 and 4a). For both n-CeO2d, linear
dependences of logðdÞ over 1=T are observed and
their slopes correspond to 0.4 and 0.2 eV. A fur-
ther evaluation is however not feasible in a
straightforward way since the temperature depen-
dence of Ks1 is unknown.
4. Conclusions
(1) Oxygen uptake/release from nanocrystalline
ceria measured by thermogravimetric techniques
under the conditions of interest for this study is
found to be mainly due to surface nonstoichiom-
etry rather than to bulk nonstoichiometry or
molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption on the
surface.
(2)
The
measured
oxygen
partial
pressure
dependencies of nonstoichiometry, varying from
0 to )1/2, for diﬀerently prepared nanocrystalline
ceria powders can be explained by the presence
of diﬀerently charged oxygen vacancies in addi-
tion to charged impurities segregated onto the
surface.
Appendix A
If the PO2 dependence of the oxygen vacancy
concentration follows a power law (½V e
O  / P n
O2 ,
regardless of the degree of ionization of the oxygen
vacancy, see the text for the notation) and as long
as we neglect oxygen excess, d becomes zero at
inﬁnitely large PO2 since ½V e
O  becomes zero, i.e. all
the isotherms asymptotically join at d  0 at inﬁ-
nitely large PO2. Owing to the electroneutrality
equation, power laws typically result in the case of
bulk materials, provided Boltzmann and Brouwer
conditions (one ionization degree of the oxygen
vacancy dominant) are fulﬁlled. As Eq. (4) shows,
such a power law may also be valid for the vacancy
concentration in a charged surface: Eq. (4) results
in a power law if e remains constant over the PO2
range under consideration. As the results show,
this is fulﬁlled for n-CeO2d [A]. Even if e is not
constant, qualitatively the same behaviour should
be observed as long as the overall vacancy con-
centration falls monotonically with PO2 as sug-
gested by the experimental data.
