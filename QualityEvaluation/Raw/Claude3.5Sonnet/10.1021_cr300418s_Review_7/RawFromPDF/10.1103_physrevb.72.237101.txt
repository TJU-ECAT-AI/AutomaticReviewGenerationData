We show that two all-electron methods, the full-potential linearized augmented wave method and the pro-
jector augmented wave method, yield a metallic groundstate for Ce2O3, as opposed to the experimentally
observed insulating groundstate. This is in contrast to previous pseudopotential calculations Phys. Rev. B 71,

resulting overestimation of the exchange splitting.

Ab initio density functional theory has been very success-
ful in the prediction of the magnetic properties of itinerant
systems. Its application to materials with strongly localized
electrons, for instance, 3d transition metal oxides and the
oxides of lanthanides, has been only partly successful, since
spurious self interactions in the present density functionals
prevent the localization of 3d and 4f electrons. Concomi-
tantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are
predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed
insulators.
In the past, calculations for Ce2O3 have been plagued by
this problem: Three of the four Ce valence electrons are “do-
nated” to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed
roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an
almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground
state.1 Recently this observation has been challenged by S.
Fabris et al.2 In the local density approximation LDA and
the generalized gradient approximation GGA, they deter-
mined an antiferromagnetic AF insulating groundstate
which is roughly 0.36 and 0.99 eV lower in energy than the
AF metallic state, respectively. Using two all-electron AE
methods, we show that the pseudopotential result cannot be
sustained, i.e., it does not correctly describe the AE LDA
limit. Both the projector augmented wave PAW method,3 as
implemented in the VASP package,4 and the full-potential lin-
earized augmented wave FLAPW method, implemented in
the WIEN2K program,5 predict a metallic ferromagnetic FM
ground state in LDA in agreement with earlier calculations,
see, e.g., Ref. 1 and only LDA+U yields the correct AF
insulating state.2
The electronic ground state was determined by using an
LDA+U approach6 and lowering the U until the effective U
becomes zero. We have used a simple LDA+U version
where the local part is described by the Ceperley-Alder
functional7 and the one-center Coulomb and exchange inter-
actions are treated by a single effective parameter U=U−J.8
Figure 1 shows the electronic density of states for U=1 and
0 eV for the FLAPW and the PAW method. Since the U
operates in the atomic spheres only and the PAW spheres are
larger than the FLAPW spheres, the effect of U is somewhat
stronger in the PAW method. Otherwise both methods yield
identical results. An insulating AF groundstate is observed
even for a relatively modest U, and the localized electron
occupies a single f orbital which is a hybrid of the two real
spherical harmonics fz3 and fyy2−3x2 in agreement with Ref.
2. When U decreases, the gap decreases as well, until an AF
metallic state is reached at roughly U=0.4 eV. In this state,
and in the FM-LDA ground state, one electron is distributed
among different f orbitals. Furthermore, the FM state is
0.1 eV lower in energy than the AF metallic state.
The
previous
pseudopotential
result—an
insulating
ground state for U=0—could be reproduced using ultrasoft

pseudopotentials, if the core radius for the reconstruction of
the charge density augmentation radius was set to rc
0.7 Å. The reason for the failure of these pseudopotentials
to reproduce the AE results is an outward shift of the maxi-
mum of the 4f pseudowave function, causing a reduction of
the core-valence overlap, and in turn, a too large value for
the spin enhancement factor

in the region where the magnetization density mr reaches
its maximum. As a result, the exchange splitting is signiﬁ-
cantly overestimated leading to an incorrect lowering of one
speciﬁc 4f orbital. The problem has been amply discussed in
literature and can lead to artifacts, such as the overestimation
of the magnetic moment in bcc Fe pseudopotential GGA
calculations in Ref. 9 obtain a moment of 2.44 B, whereas
the AE value is 2.2 B, see, e.g., Ref. 4 or the incorrect
prediction of a magnetic V001 surface.10
In conclusion, all-electron local density functional calcu-
lations do not yield the proper insulating ground state for
Ce2O3. The previous pseudopotential calculations suffer
from an erroneous overestimation of the spin-enhancement
factor and a resulting overestimation of the exchange split-
ting. In passing, we note that another recent pseudopotential
study
seems
to
suffer
from
similar
pseudopotential
deﬁciencies.11 In general we believe that the application of
pseudopotentials to magnetic systems is therefore problem-
atic, and values must be checked against AE calculations.
