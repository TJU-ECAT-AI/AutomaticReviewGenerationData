1. Introduction. 
Chemical reactions produce new molecules for old ones; atoms are 
re-arranged, old bonds broken and new bonds formed. Chemists realise 
that inertia is caused by the necessity of breaking bonds while the driv- 
ing force is due to the formation of new bonds. We will state here the 
principles of chemical mechanism in such terms that this old idea of 
chemistry should reappear in the outlines of the modern theory. 
For the sake of simplicity, we restrict ourselves to reactions of the 
" 
three centre " type such as, 
where A, B and C are the reacting atoms, ions or groups. 
ing is a list of various types of such reactions :

 London’s 
Theory. 
Reaction (I) is the classical example for the application of the semi- 
empirical method of calculating activation energies which had its origin 
in London’s theory and which is reviewed by Professor Eyring in this 
Discussion. We restate this theory here by giving it a formulation 
which will be applicable also to other types of reaction. 
In a reaction A + 
BC = 
AB + 
C we can arrive at identical con- 
figurations of the particles either (a) by compressing A against the 
molecule BC (which may be extended or compressed, but always re- 
mains a molecule) or (b) by pressing C against the molecule AB (AB re- 
maining a molecule). 
In the first case the potential energy of the system is given, according 
to Slater by, 
Qbc + 
J a c  + 
Qab + 
Quc - 
i 
( J a b  + 
J u c )  
- 
(1) 
where Qbc, Qab, Q
,
,
 are the coulombic integrals between the pairs of 
atoms AB, BC, AC and Jao 
Jab, Jllc 
are the interchange integrals be- 
tween the same pairs of atoms.

f
 the distance BC is kept constant and the distances AB and AC 
changed this expression defines a repulsion curve between the molecule 
BC and the atom A. A family of such curves, defining a repulsion 
surface, can be obtained by choosing different internuclear separation 
for the molecule BC, thus changing the values of Qbc 
and Jbc in equation 
(I). We call #1 the state corresponding to this energy surface ; then : 
El = 
J*lH’ldT 
where H is the energy operator.

Similarly for the second case (b) 
we can define the state t

 when 
where E ,  will define another energy surface made up of a continuous 
series of repulsion curves for different internuclear separations AB. 
Between the two states $
,
 and #2 there will be resonance leading 
to two continuous energy surfaces. 
When A + 
BC and AB + 
C 
have the same configuration and the same energy, the two original 
energy surfaces will interesect. On this line of intersection there will 
be one point of lowest energy. The configuration corresponding to 
the lowest point of this intersecting line is a very close approximation 
to the transition state of the reaction and its energy is found by taking 
into account the perturbation energy as follows. Along the intersecting 
line of the two surfaces (because #l and a,h2 are degenerate) the energy 
of the system will be given by either : 
E3 = 
8 (S#,H*ldT + 
S#2H#2d7 - S+lH#,dT) 
E4 = 
4 
(S#lH#ldT + 
S*,H#2dT + 
2 S#lHhd4 
or 
Since the energy of the two states is identical at the intersecting 
line 
S#lH*ldT = 
S#2H*2d7 = 
Ei 
E4 = 
E, + 
El, 
E3 = 
Ei - 
El2 
where El, is the perturbation energy between states #
,
 and #
,
.
 
It is 
easy to show that this method leads to results identical with those ob- 
tained by the method of London. 
Thus the presentation of the energy changes involved in these re- 
actions can be divided into a consideration of 
I .  repulsion forces between A and BC, 
2. extension forces of the molecule BC, 
3. repulsion forces between AB and C, 
4. extension forces of the molecule AB, 
5. the perturbation integral between the states #

Activation Energy. 
In these terms the theory of London can be seen to represent a 
particular solution of the following general problem :-If

reaction consists in the transfer of a " 
central atom " B in the sense

repulsion between the BC molecule and the A particle; B ,  and R, 
denoting the corresponding energy terms of state 11. 
In a configuration for which the values of El and E, approach each 
other, perturbation will cause the system to have two energy values 
both differing from El and E,. 
These can be represented in a simple 
fashion for such configurations for which El and E ,  have identical 
values E,; the two energy values of the system will then be 
The transition state of the reaction has the configuration for which 
E, has its minimum value, Em 
; the activation energy is Em 
- 
El,. 
In the previous section we pointed out that London’s theory deter- 
mines the terms B, R and El, for the transfer of a univalent atom B 
from one homopolar linkage AB into another linkage BC. For other 
cases we might use other methods for calculating the B and R terms 
and the perturbation energy El,. The task is greatly simplified if 
we consider only reactions for which El, is small and, can be neglected 
or introduced merely as a correction. 
The perturbation energy is the smaller, the more extensive is the 
reorganisation of the electronic structure involved in the reaction. 
E,, might, therefore, be expected to be small for such “ 
electron-switch ” 
reactions as listed under 2-5, whereas it has a decisive influence in homo- 
polar reactions of the type (I). 
We 
will presently discuss in detail the methods of finding this quantity. 
We note, however, that some complications arise if E,, is very small, 
i.e., considerable less than kT. The transition from the El 
surface to 
the E, surface is then restricted, which causes a reduction of the 
temperature independent factor. 
We will set aside this difficulty by 
considering here only such collisions which actually lead to reaction. 
At low temperatures, to which we restrict ourselves, the transition from 
the syrface El 
to the surface E ,  will always occur at the configuration 
corresponding to Em. 
If El, is small, the activation energy becomes equal to Em. 
4. The Energy Surfaces of the Initial and Final States. 
The energies El and E, form two surfaces (to which we can now 
refer as corresponding to two electronic states) which cover the same 
values of the co-ordinates which are the distances A-B 
and B-C 
in the 
linear arrangement of the centres1 ABC. A pair of surfaces for the 
symmetrical system ABC arising when the centre C is identical with A 
is shown in Fig. I .  The zero of energy is that of the initial state which 
here is identical with the final state. The surfaces El and E ,  (being 
symmetrical to the axes) cross each other at configurations along the 
diagonal, i.e., for A-B = 
B-C. Along the intersection curve, 4 leaves 
join together ; a pair of higher and a pair of lower leaves. The latter 
pair which contains the initial and final states is drawn with thicker 
contours. The intersection curve of the surfaces appears as a straight 
line in Fig. I .  To show the shape of this curve a.

energy rises monotonously as shown in Fig. 4.

5. Chemical Inertia and Chemical Driving Force. 
We will say that a reaction has " 
inertia " if it possesses activation 
energy in the exothermic direction and, consequently its activation 
energy in the opposite direction exceeds its endothermicity.

the molecule AB contracts along P-R and finally C is removed along

parts of the curves we can now see how the driving force reduces the 
activation energy and can see further, why it cannot reduce inertia to zero. 
The activation energy is reduced by the fact that owing to the prox- 
imity of the lateral centres A 
and C the attraction curves of 
BC and AB cross each other. 
The energy of the transition 
state which lies at this crossing 
point is thereby reduced below 
the value of the fully dissoci- 
ated state. 
One might say 
that the bond to be formed 
begins to pull at a stage where 
the original binding is not yet 
broken. 
But at the same time the 
diagram shows that this ad- 
vantage has not been obtained 
without sacrifice. Repulsions

had to be overcome in bringing the 
atoms more closely together which has resulted in an upward-shift of 
the attraction curves BC and AB. 
We notice in particular that both curves have moved upwards : 
the BC curve moved by the amount of the energy required to approach 
A to the position (with respect to the BC molecule) which corresponds 
to the transition state; the AB curve moved by the amount of energy 
released when C is repelled to infinity after the transfer of B has been 
completed. The upward shifts of the two attraction curves naturally 
raises the energy-height 
of their crossing point. 
Is it then, after all, worth while to move the atoms closer together ? 
Do not the costs outweigh the 
\

gains ? 
\

The answer which can be read 
from Fig. 9, is that up to a certain 
point compression of the system is 
bound to yield a net reduction of 
the activation energy but that 
further compression will eventu- 
ally increase the activation energy. 
The results of such excessive com- 
pression on the energy diagram of 
a reaction path is shown in Fig. 10.

the reaction can be found by mov-

watching the height at which they cross each other; when this height 
is a minimum, the crossing point is the transition state of the reaction,

20 CHEMICAL REACTIONS-INERTIA 
AND DRIVING FORCE 
We can summarise our views on inertia and driving force for a three- 
centre reaction A + 
BC = 
AB + 
C in the case that the perturbation 
energy can be neglected as follows : 
(I) Inertia is primarily due to the binding force residing in BC. 
It 
is reduced by the action of the binding force AB if A is pushed on close 
to B preliminary to transferring B from C to A. Thus, the bond strength 
which causes inertia for the forward reaction, acts as driving force in 
the opposite direction. 
(2) 
The repulsion between A and BC as well as the repulsion between 
AB and C cause an increase in the activation energy. This constitutes 
a second source of inertia, which, in contrast to the first form of inertia 
arising from bond strength, operates equally in both directions of the 
reaction. 
(3) The inertia arising from repulsion counteracts the driving force. 
If the atoms A, B, C, could be pushed together without expenditure of 
work into a configuration in which the distances A-B and B-C would be 
equal to their normal bonding distances, chemical inertia would be ab- 
sent. The presence of repulsion between A and BC and between AB 
and C makes this impossible and sets a limit to the extent to which 
inertia is reduced by the driving force. 
6 .  Nature of Repulsion. 
The con- 
struction of the energy surfaces E, and E, for such examples as listed 
under 2-5 
would involve the calculation of repulsions either between 
an atom and a homopolar molecule or between an atom and an ion. 
The latter case includes the repulsion between an atom and an ionic 
molecule as well as that between an ion and a homopolar molecule. 
The calculation for an atom and a homopolar molecule can be based 
on the theory of London in conjunction with optical data. 
The repulsion between atoms and ions has been estimated by various 
assumptions linking the problem up with empirical data. We have 
either made use of our knowledge of the repulsion acting between ions 
in crystals by identifying the atom in question with an equivalent 
type of i0n.l Or we used the virial of equivalent molecules in the gas- 
phase.2 A further method which has been explored (in yet unpublished 
work) is to.identify the ion with the atom of the same sort and assuming 
it to be in an antibonding relation to the other atom. 
All three approximations have been examined for the reactions of 
sodium vapour with halogen alkyls to which we refer in the two follow- 
ing sections. The fact that the results obtained are similar whichever 
approximation is used, and that the activation energies so obtained are 
in reasonable agreement with the experimental values, indicate that the 
various methods have a common element of truth. 
The significance of any uncertainty regarding the repulsive forces 
is further reduced by the fact that the sequence and grading of reactiv- 
ities in groups of similar reactions, can be accounted for merely by the 
grading of bond strengths while assuming an invariant repulsion curve.l 
In fact the laws of prototropic reactions can be derived by assuming a 
rigid and constant distance between the lateral centres A and C (the

proton being B).* It thus appears that as a heuristic principle it is 
justifiable to make some assumption about the repulsive forces common 
to a group of reactions and thereby to explain the regularities within 
that group. 
The fact should be mentioned that repulsion might be due to de- 
solvationl which is important for ionic reactions in solution (see next 
section). 
7. Absence of Repulsion on one Side of the Reaction. 
We have already pointed out that in the absence of repulsive forces 
no inertia can arise. The gas-phase reactions

NaCl is fully utilised since the NaCl can 
be formed at the transition point with its normal inter-nuclear separa- 
tion without any consequent expenditure for overcoming repulsion. 
Calculation is greatly simplified, since the transition state and the 
activation energy of the reaction can be found without' plotting energy 
surfaces. All that is required is to place the extension curve of RCI and 
the repulsion curve arising between R and CI- at the position given by 
the heat of reaction : the point of intersection gives the configuration 
and energy of the transition state of the reaction. 
An interesting case which has hitherto been only qualitatively dis- 
cussed on lines which are analogous to the above, is the electrolytic 
dissociation, e.g., RC1 = 
Rf + 
C1-. 
We might expect the transition 
state to be given on the lines of Fig. 10 
by the intersection of the attrac- 
tion curve RCl with the repulsion curve arising between the ions. 
If repulsion is only absent on one side, chemical inertia will, in general,

8. Reactivity and Reaction Heat.l 
It is interesting to consider the reaction Na + 
C1R = 
NaCl + 
R in 
the following way. With the sodium atom at infinity the position of 
the molecular energy curve of RCl to that of the repulsion curve R-Cl- 
would be as in Fig. 12, where the distance V between the asymptotes 
corresponds to the energy involved in transferring an electron from Na 
to C1. 
When Na reacts with ClR the repulsion curve is lodered to the 
extent of the heat of formation of NaCl from Na+ and C1-. 
The same 
result is obtained in Fig. 13 by starting with the two curves so placed 
that they approach the same asymptote and then lowering the repulsion 
curve to the extent of the heat offormation of NaClfrom Na and C1.

This leads on to the conclusion that if we change the alkali metal 
substituting, .g.,eK or Cs for Nathe result will correspond to a further 
downward shift of the repulsion curve to the extent by which the reaction 
heat is increased. The consequence is, as Fig. 14 
shows, a decrease in 
activation energy, Eg) - 
EE). It might hence be predicted that react- 
ivity increases with reaction heat in the homologous series of alkali 
metal vapours. Fig. 14 
also shows that an increase in reaction heat by 
the amount A H  will cause a smaller decrease in activation energy, i.e.,

thus is seen to prevail when a lateral centre A or C is varied, does not arise

GENERAL DISCUSSION 
represented by Fig. 14, or Fig. 15. The derivation of Bronsted's law 
for the particular case of proton transfer reactions, which is the original 
scope of the law, was given on similar lines by Horiuti and Polanyi.4 
Parallel changes in reaction heat and activation energy may also 
arise in some series of reactions belonging to the more general type 
discussed in section 5 .  It would, however, again be limited to such 
series in which either A or C are varied. Such variations might result 
merely in a vertical shift of either the El 
surface or of the E, surface 
and the consequent change in activation energy would then correspond 
to equation (6). On the other hand a variation of B would necessarily 
affect both surfaces jointly. 
Relationships of the type given in equation (9) have been more re- 
cently expressed by means of the transition state method.s Variations 
in the lateral centres A or C are then represented as the action of a con- 
tinuously changing parameter on the free energy of the reaction and 
on the free energy of the transition state, the assumption being that the 
derivative of these free energies with respect to the parameter is constant 
over a certain range of the parameter. 
We have here derived equation (9) for reactions which are assumed 
to have a certain mechanism by using the approximation (expressed in 
equations 7 and 8) that the free energies of the reaction and of the transi- 
tion state vary proportionally to the reaction heat and to the activation 
energy respectively. 
Clearly our mechanism thus gives an explanation 
why these particular reactions can be treated by the method of the 
variable parameter.
