Oxygen vacancy pairs have been suggested to play a role in the reduction of NO molecules on ceria
and for the oxidation processes of reducible rare-earth oxides. The formation energy of the oxygen
vacancy pairs and the changes in the structural and electronic properties of the ceria (110) surface with
oxygen vacancy pairs are investigated using density-functional theory (DFT + U) methodology within
the generalized gradient approximation. It is found that the excess electrons localize on the Ce ions
neighbouring the vacancies, and the most stable structure for the oxygen vacancy pairs on the ceria
(110) surface is at next-nearest-neighbour site.

1. Introduction
Ceria is one of the most interesting oxides industrially because
it can readily create oxygen vacancies and whereby Ce4+ ions are
reduced to Ce3+. This property gives ceria its high “oxygen stor-
age capacity” as well as its catalytic properties; both aspects make
ceria an important component of, for example, the three-way cat-
alyst converter (TWC) which is used to reduce the amount of toxic
species in automobile exhausts [1–3]. Recently, high-resolution
structural information concerning oxygen vacancies on ceria sur-
faces has been reported. Thus, from scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) experiments, analysed with the help of density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, Esch et al. have reported that the oxy-
gen vacancies on reduced CeO2(111) surfaces form linear vacancy
clusters [4]. Torbrugge et al. have found evidence of linear patterns
of sub-surface oxygen vacancies for reduced CeO2(111) surfaces,
using atomic resolution dynamic force microscopy [5]. Ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and X-ray photoelectron spec-

troscopy (XPS) results have shown that localized states in the band
gap become occupied when the surface is partially reduced and
that the top of the valence band spectrum for the partially re-
duced ceria can be described as a combination of spectra for fully
reduced Ce3+ and fully oxidized Ce4+, suggesting localization of
electrons on the reduced Ce ions [6–8].
It is known that the ceria (111) surface is the most stable sur-
face and has been studied extensively, including a recent paper by
David King’s group which studied the vacancy clusters on the (111)
surface [9]. Considering that the (110) surface is the second stable
surface among the low index ceria surfaces and chemically more
active, the present study deals with the formation of oxygen va-
cancy pairs on the CeO2(110) surface by means of DFT calculations.
Knowing the local structure, clustering properties and mobility of
the oxygen vacancies on surfaces of ceria is of paramount impor-
tance for understanding their catalytic roles, both in the context
of supported noble metals and in relation to the oxygen storage
capacity of ceria. Using in situ FTIR spectroscopy and mass spec-
trometry, Daturi et al. [10] found that the “deNOx” activity (i.e. the
ability to remove nitrogen oxides, NOx, namely NO2, NO, N2O) of
oxide-based catalysts such as ceria can be correlated to the con-
centration of surface oxygen vacancies present at the surface. Da-
turi et al. [10] proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on
CeO2 surfaces, where the two oxygen atoms of two NO molecules

ﬁll two neighboring oxygen vacancies, thus acting as reoxidizing
agents on the prereduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms com-
bine to give rise to a N2 molecule. Previous DFT-GGA calculations
of ours [11] indeed indicated the important role that oxygen va-
cancies play for the adsorption of NO on ceria surfaces. We found
that one NO molecule adsorbs much more strongly on reduced ce-
ria (111) and (110) surfaces than on the stoichiometric surfaces.
Moreover, two NO molecules adsorbed on a reduced ceria (110)
surface, O-ends down at two neighboring oxygen vacancies, their
N-ends were found to form a strong N–N bond with little or no
barrier [11]. This is an intermediate step towards release of free
N2, a reaction which is calculated to be strongly thermodynami-
cally driven.
The clustering properties (e.g. the pair association) of oxygen
vacancies thus have special implications for the oxidation of NO
molecules on the ceria surfaces. In this Letter we present a com-
prehensive DFT + U investigation of the (110) surface of ceria
for different oxygen vacancy pairs: nearest neighbors, next-nearest
neighbors, etc. The goal of this Letter is to ﬁnd the most fa-
vorable geometric conﬁguration of oxygen vacancy pairs on ceria
(110) surface. Both experiments and calculations show that the
(111) surface is the most stable ceria surface; the (110) surface
is thus metastable. This is especially interesting for catalytic pur-
poses since the latter can therefore be expected to be more active
than the former. Moreover, both force-ﬁeld based [12] and DFT+ U
[13] studies have suggested that surface oxygen vacancies are more
stable on the (110) surface compared to those on the (111) surface.
For a single oxygen vacancy on the ceria (111) or the ce-
ria (110) surface, many theoretical investigations, with many dif-
ferent methods, have been reported in the literature. Force-ﬁeld
based methods as well as quantum-mechanical periodic DFT cal-
culations or wave function-based calculations have thus been used
to elucidate surface structure, electronic band structure, electron
localization, surface dynamics, defect stability, etc., of the oxy-
gen vacancy on these surfaces [14–17]. In addition, several papers
have appeared with a focus on methodological aspects relating to
the calculation of strongly correlated systems such as reduced ce-
ria. We do not list all these references here, but rather refer to
Refs. [14–17] as being periodic DFT calculations of particular rel-
evance for the current study. References within these publications
together provide an extensive list.
The computational method is brieﬂy described in Section 2. The
results are presented and discussed in Section 3. Conclusions are
ﬁnally summarized in Section 4.
2. Model and calculation methods
2.1. Description of the model systems
Bulk crystalline CeO2 has the ﬂuorite structure. Reference cal-
culations for bulk CeO2 were performed for a 12-atom unit cell,
which was optimized with respect to both the cell parameter and
the atomic positions, until the force on each atom was less than
0.02 eV/Å and the stress tensor on the cell less than 0.1 GPa.
Our calculations gave an equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.480 Å,
which is close to the experimental value of 5.411 Å [18].
The CeO2(110) surface system was modeled as a stack of (neu-
tral) CeO2 layers in a supercell containing 108 atoms, out of which
two neutral O atoms were subsequently removed from the top
layer, in different geometrical constellations. In order to dimin-
ish the interaction between the defects and their periodic images,
a large lateral cell was used, namely p(3 × 3), but instead the slab
was made only 4 layers thick. The two bottom layers were ﬁxed at
their bulk positions, while the positions of the ions in the two up-
per layers were fully optimized (under the restriction of ﬁxed cell
parameters). A vacuum layer of 15 Å was introduced to separate
the ﬁlms. The side view of the unreduced CeO2(110) slab model is
shown in Fig. 1(a), and the top view in Fig. 1(b). The latter ﬁgure
also deﬁnes the labels of the various oxygen vacancy pairs exam-
ined in this Letter. The (3 × 3) surface expansion ensures enough
separations between defects (e.g., 11.62 Å between single vacan-
cies; 8.36 Å between the closest vacancy pairs). Test calculations
using a thicker slab (a 5-layer slab) showed that the results are
reasonably converged, e.g. the single vacancy formation energy for
a 5-layer slab has a small difference (∼0.1 eV) as compared with
that for a 4-layer slab. Most importantly, the relative stability of
different vacancy patterns are almost the same and the trend is
not changed.
2.2. Calculations
Spin-polarized Kohn–Sham density functional theory calcula-
tions were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP) [19,20]. The valence electronic states were thus expanded
in a basis of plane waves. The projector-augmented wave (PAW)
method [21] of Blöchl, as implemented in VASP, was used for the
treatment of the core electrons, and the cerium 5s, 5p, 5d, 4 f , and
6s electrons, the oxygen 2s and 2p were treated as valence elec-
trons. The electron exchange and correlation were treated within
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–
Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. DFT with the inclusion of on-site
Coulomb interaction (the DFT + U method) [22,23] was chosen as
our computational approach, due to the inability of GGA-DFT to
describe the Ce4 f electronic states which result from formation
of oxygen vacancies in ceria [16,24,25]. In the DFT + U method,
a Hubbard parameter, U, is introduced for the Ce4 f electrons to
describe the on-site Coulomb interaction; this helps to remove the
self-interaction error and improves the description of correlation
effects. Some authors have already described how the value of U
is ﬁtted against experimental results for correctly describing the
properties of both the CeO2 and partially reduced ceria (CeO2−x)

[13,15,16]. It has been shown that by choosing an appropriate U
parameter to account for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion
among the localized Ce4 f electrons, it is possible to consistently
describe structural, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of
CeO2, Ce2O3, and CeO2−x, which enables modeling of redox pro-
cesses involving ceria-based materials [13,15,16]. The results of our
test calculations and previous work [13,15,16] both indicated that
only if U = 5 eV and greater can the localization of the Ce4 f elec-
trons in the partially reduced ceria be properly described. There-
fore, in all the calculations, we ﬁxed the U value at 5 eV.
An energy cutoff of 350 eV was used for the plane wave expan-
sion of the PAW. The Monkhorst–Pack (MP) method [26] was used
for the Brillouin Zone sampling. A MP grid of (2 × 2 × 1) was used
for all the surface calculations. For the structure optimization, the
ionic positions were allowed to relax until the Hellman–Feynman
forces were less than 0.02 eV/Å. These values have been found to
give good convergence for the quantities under consideration here
(e.g. the atomic structures, formation energies of oxygen vacancies,
etc.).
The stabilities of the systems with two oxygen vacancies were
studied by way of the vacancy association energy, Epairing, which
we deﬁne as
Epairing = E vpair −2E v
(1)
where E vpair is the energy required to remove two O atoms (one
from site i and one from site j), and E v is the corresponding single
oxygen vacancy formation energy, i.e.
E v = E(v) −E(CeO2) + 1/2E(O2),
(2)
E vpair = E(vi, v j) −E(CeO2) + E(O2).
(3)
E(CeO2) is the total energy per supercell of the stoichiometric
system. E(v) is the total energy of the reduced supercell with one
O vacancy in the surface layer. E(vi, v j) is the total energy of the
reduced supercell with two O vacancies (at site i and site j, re-
spectively). E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an
optimized oxygen molecule in the gas phase. By substituting (2)
and (3) into (1), we can write Epairing as
Epairing = E(vi, v j) −2E(v) + E(CeO2).
(4)
Thus, a negative value for Epairing means that the formation of
an O vacancy pair is more favorable than the formation of two iso-
lated O vacancies, and a positive value means that vacancy pairing
is unfavorable.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Single oxygen vacancy
3.1.1. Energetics and geometric structure
As a reference for the oxygen vacancy pairs, ﬁrstly, the ce-
ria (110) surface with a single vacancy was studied. A single oxy-
gen vacancy was created by removing an oxygen atom from the
relaxed stoichiometric CeO2(110)p(3× 3) surface. The fully relaxed
atomic structures at the DFT + U level are showed in Fig. 2(a)
and (b), together with the distribution of extra electrons on two
Ce ions neighboring the vacancy which corresponds two reduced
Ce ions (denoted as Ce3+) and will be discussed below. The for-
mation energy (E v) for a single surface oxygen vacancy calcu-
lated using Eq. (2) is 2.10 eV, which is close to our former result
(∼2.30 eV) [27]. The small difference is probably caused by the
different supercells used in our two calculations (in the present
study we have a larger surface cell, i.e. lower vacancy concentra-
tion, and a thinner slab), and by the different cutoff energies used
for the plane wave expansion (350 eV vs. 408 eV). It has been re-
ported [14,25] that on the ceria (111) surface, the subsurface O
vacancy is more stable than the surface vacancy. For comparison,
we checked the subsurface vacancy and found a structure which is
much less stable than the surface vacancy on ceria (110) surface,
e.g. the formation energy of a subsurface oxygen vacancy is higher
by 1.44 eV than that of a surface oxygen vacancy. Therefore, the
oxygen vacancy is preferred to be created on the top layer of the
ceria (110) surface. It is obviously an approximation not to allow
relaxations in the third layer; however we expect them to be quite
small. We have checked with the current 4 layer slabs for allow-
ing the 3rd layer relaxations. The results are slightly different from
those presented for the case with the 3rd layer ﬁxed, e.g., the sin-
gle oxygen vacancy formation energy is lowered by about 0.07 eV.
It is found that the formation of a surface oxygen vacancy in-
duces very large relaxations, similar to the features that have been
found in our previous paper for the CeO2(110)p(2 × 2) [27]. As
shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), at the defective ceria (110) surface with
an oxygen vacancy, the closest surface O neighbor “on the left side
of” the vacancy moves toward the vacancy by about 0.26 Å. This

phenomenon is similar to the former results [27] where a smaller
relaxation (0.15 Å) was reported, which may be caused by the
differences of the supercells, corresponding to different vacancy
concentrations on the surfaces. Another O ion neighbor (“to the
right of”) the vacancy moves toward the vacancy by about 0.24 Å.
The two Ce ions neighboring the vacancy move away from the va-
cancy by about 0.21 Å. In the subsurface layer, the two O ions and
one Ce ion neighboring the vacancy move toward and away from
the vacancy, respectively, by 0.16 Å. As a result, the Ce–O distances
(especially the Ce3+–O distances) around the vacancy site are quite
different from those on the unreduced relaxed ceria (110) surface.
For example, there are totally ﬁve Ce3+–O neighbors around the
vacancy site, among which, the three Ce3+–Osurf (Osurf denotes the
surface O ions) distances are 2.28, 2.32 and 2.4 Å, respectively.
Therefore, one Ce–Osurf distance is longer, while the other two are
shorter as compared with that (2.34 Å) on the unreduced relaxed
ceria (110) surface. The two Ce3+–Osub (Osub denotes the subsur-
face O ions) distances are 2.31, 2.36 Å, respectively, which are both
longer than the corresponding Ce4+–Osub distance (2.24 Å) of the
unreduced system. This relaxation pattern with the oxygen ions
around the vacancy moving toward the vacancy and the Ce ions
moving away from it is the same as that found and discussed in
our previous papers [24,28,29]. It is the positive electric ﬁeld cen-
tered on the vacancy that results in this structural rearrangement
with the cations moving away from the vacancy and the anions
attracted to it.
3.1.2. Electronic structure
Reduction strongly modiﬁes the electronic structure of the ce-
ria surface. The total density of states (TDOS) for the ceria (110)
surface with a single-oxygen vacancy is shown in Fig. 2(c). Similar
to experimental observations [6,7] and DFT + U results in the lit-
erature [13,27], a new DOS peak near the Fermi level appears in
the O2p–Ce4 f gap. The electron density of these gap states is dis-
played in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The localization of excess electrons on
the two cerium sites neighboring the oxygen vacancy site in the
surface layer is clearly seen, showing that the gap states found in
Fig. 2(c) arise from the formation of two reduced Ce3+ ions. Again,
these ﬁndings are consistent with experimental results [6,7]. The
spin density (spin-up electron density minus spin-down electron
density; not shown here) looks very similar to the electron den-
sity of the gap states [as displayed in Fig. 2(a) and (b)] and shows
that the defective (110) surface is ferromagnetic with all the spin
moments are parallel aligned.
The partial density of state (PDOS) (not shown here) shows
that the gap state peaks are almost pure Ce4 f states. We also
performed a Bader type analysis [30] of the electron density cor-
responding to the gap states and found that there are about 0.98
excess electrons localized on each of the reduced Ce3+ ions in the
surface layer, similar to our former results (0.93) [27].
3.2. Oxygen vacancy pairs
3.2.1. Energetics and geometric structure
We now report on the results obtained for a reduced ceria
(110) surface with two neutral oxygen atoms removed from the
stoichiometric CeO2(110)p(3 × 3) surface layer. The formation and
association energies of the various oxygen vacancy pairs consid-
ered here (listed in Fig. 1(b)) are plotted in Fig. 3. It is found that
the “P15” vacancy pair (i.e. the next-nearest neighbor site) forms
the most stable oxygen vacancy pair structure on the ceria (110)
surface. In fact, it is the only one with a negative association en-
ergy (Epairing = −0.26 eV) amongst those we have explored, i.e. the
only one which is favored compared to two isolated O vacancies. In
the following, we will focus our discussion on the electronic struc-
ture and the relaxed geometry of the P15 oxygen vacancy pair.
The fully relaxed atomic structure is displayed in Fig. 4(a). Only
the top view with the distribution of the excess electrons (which
will be discussed later) is shown. It is found that the surface O
ions neighboring the vacancy move toward the vacancy by about
0.30 Å. The surface Ce ions neighboring the vacancy (i.e., the Ce
ions with the excess electrons, as we shall see below) move away
from the vacancy by about 0.22 Å and 0.16 Å, respectively. The O
and Ce ions in the second layer experience similar but weaker per-
turbations, where the O ions (Ce ions) move toward (away from)
the vacancy by about 0.11 Å (0.16 Å). The structural relaxations are
also reﬂected in the changes of the Ce–O distances around the va-
cancy pair, e.g. the Ce3+–Osurf distances on the surface layer are:
2.30, 2.27, 2.51, 2.33, 2.49, 2.41 Å, respectively, and the Ce3+–Osub
distances are: 2.33, 2.33, 2.32, 2.34 Å, respectively. All the oxygen
vacancy pair structures explored here were found to display simi-
lar relaxations near the vacancy sites, i.e., the O anions neighboring

the vacancy move towards the vacancy center, while the Ce cations
neighboring the vacancy move away.
3.2.2. Electronic structure
When two neutral oxygen atoms are removed from the ce-
ria (110) surface, four electrons are left behind. The surface relax-
ation discussed above occurs as a consequence of the loss of the
O atoms and the redistribution of the excess electrons. In this sec-
tion we will discuss the details of the electronic structure and the
electron distribution, with special emphasis on the “P15” structure.
The total density of states for the “P15” structure is shown in
Fig. 4(b). Similar to the single-vacancy case, a new peak is seen
to appear between the top of the valence band and the bottom
of the unoccupied Ce4 f states. A Bader type analysis [30] of the
charge density corresponding to these gap states reveals that four
electrons are localized on the four Ce ions neighboring the oxy-
gen vacancy pairs (about 0.99 excess electrons on each Ce ion; see
Fig. 4(a)). A PDOS analysis shows that the gap states peak consists
almost exclusively of Ce4 f electrons.
Now let us analyze the physical origin of why the “P15” oxygen
vacancy pair structure on the ceria (110) surface is the most favor-
able. The distribution of the excess electron density (corresponding
to the gap states) for all the other vacancy pair constellations stud-
ied here are shown in Fig. 5. There would be two main factors
that affect the formation energy of the oxygen vacancy pair. On
the one hand, it can be seen clearly that the structures (e.g. P12,
P13, P14, P16) that have some excess electrons localized on one
or more Ce ions on the subsurface layer (e.g., the Ce cations with
the dashed circles in Fig. 5) have higher formation energies for
the oxygen vacancy pair, while the structures (e.g. P15, P17, P37)
with all the excess electrons localized on the surface layer have
relatively lower formation energies for the oxygen vacancy pair.
It is known that the reduced cerium cations (Ce3+) are larger in
size than the Ce4+, therefore the creation of Ce3+ in the sublayer
would cost more energy (for the structure adaptation for the larger
Ce3+ cations) than in the top layer. Furthermore, the formation of
the vacancies provides extra space for accommodating the bigger
Ce3+, which makes the excess electrons tend to localize on the Ce
ions neighboring the vacancies. We will call this factor the “struc-
tural adaptation”. On the other hand, the Ce cations with excess
electrons would tend to be further apart because of the Coulomb
repulsion. If the creation of oxygen vacancy pairs results in Ce3+
cations that are far apart, the formation energy would be lower
because of the lower Coulomb repulsion. We call this factor as
the “electronic adaptation”. By inspecting the three structures with
relatively lower formation energies, i.e., the P15 (Fig. 4(a)), P17
(Fig. 5(e)) and P37 (Fig. 5(f)), it is found that their excess elec-
trons are localized on two Ce3+ pairs. The intra-pair distances (the
Ce–Ce distances within a pair of Ce3+) are similar (4.24 Å, 4.21 Å,
4.23 Å), while the inter-pair distances (the Ce–Ce distances be-

tween two Ce3+ in different pairs) are much different (6.85 Å,
5.47 Å, 5.24 Å) for the P15, P17 and P37 structures, respectively.
The larger inter-pair distances in the P15 structure as compared
with others makes it more favorable. Both the “structural adap-
tation” and “electronic adaptation” are decisive for the ﬁnal geo-
metric structure of the oxygen vacancy pairs. There should be a
balance between the two factors (e.g. “structural adaptation” and
“electronic adaptation”). On the one hand, the “structural adapta-
tion” makes the excess electrons localize close to the vacancies, on
the other hand, the “electronic adaptation” makes the excess elec-
trons depart away as far as possible.
3.2.3. Implication for NO reduction
As mentioned in the introduction section, Daturi et al. [10]
have proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on ceria
whereby two NO molecules adsorbed on neighboring oxygen va-
cancies react to give dinitrogen. Using DFT calculations, Yang et al.
performed a preliminary examination of this idea by considering
two NO molecules adsorbed on a preformed nearest neighboring
oxygen vacancy pairs [11]. In the present study, we found that the
most stable conﬁguration of an oxygen vacancy pair on the ce-
ria (110) is the P15 pattern (the next nearest neighboring pair)
instead of the nearest neighboring pairs. This result, especially if
it can be conﬁrmed by experiment in the future, will be impor-
tant for the understanding of the dissociation mechanism of NO
molecules on ceria. To this end, test calculations for the adsorp-
tion of two NO molecules on the most stable di-vacancy surface
(P15) were performed. It is found that there is no clear tendency
of forming an N–N bond. Instead, the NO molecules were adsorbed
above the vacancies with their N–O bonds lying almost parallel to
the surface O rows as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The adsorbed NO
molecules bind with the surface Ce3+ ions neighboring the vacan-
cies through their both ends and the N–O bonds are stretched by
about 0.1 Å as compared with the calculated value for the free NO.
The bond lengths are shown in Fig. 6(b). The gap states [as shown
in the DOS plots in Fig. 6(c)] and the corresponding electron dis-
tribution [Fig. 6(b)] show clearly that bonds formed between NO
molecules and the surface Ce3+ ions. Indeed, Bader charge anal-
ysis [30] shows that the adsorbed NO molecules get about 0.65
electrons each. Since the mechanism for the dissociation of NO on
ceria proposed by Daturi et al. [10] depends closely on the for-
mation of neighboring vacancies, some factors (e.g. doping with
metal atoms) would be needed to enhance the formation of near-
est neighboring vacancy pairs or clusters. Further studies are un-
dertaken to verify this.
4. Conclusions
The DFT + U formalism has been used to study oxygen va-
cancy pairs defects on the (110) surface of ceria. Geometrically,
it is found that the most favorable oxygen vacancy pair is the
next nearest neighbor pattern (i.e., the P15 pattern in our deno-
tation), instead of the nearest neighbor pattern. Two main factors,
i.e. “structural adaptation” and “electronic adaptation”, are found
to be decisive for the formation energy and the association energy
of the oxygen vacancy pairs and therefore determine ﬁnal geomet-
ric structure of the oxygen vacancy pairs. The electronic properties
of the oxygen vacancy pairs were studied through the density of
states and the charge density analyses. For the most stable oxygen
vacancy pair pattern (the P15 pattern), extra electron localization
is found on four neighboring Ce4+ ions, which are reduced to Ce3+.
For some of the other oxygen vacancy pairs examined, the electron
localization is clearly different from “the sum of” two isolated va-
cancies, and often involves the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second
atomic layer. The results in the present work will be important
for understanding the mechanisms about the dissociation of NO
molecules on ceria.
