[1] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."

[2] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy. Informally, we call this a moderation principle."

[3] "The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

[4] "Cu-doped lanthanum oxide is an example of this. The oxygen is so easy to remove that it is likely to be lost at a temperature lower than that of methane activation. This means that, under reaction conditions, the catalyst is reduced; our calculations show that the reduced CuLa2O3 does not break the CH bond efficiently."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the replenishment of these oxygen vacancies from gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher reactivity towards reactants like methane, as it indicates that surface oxygen atoms are more easily removed to participate in the oxidation reaction. However, there is an optimal range for ΔEv, referred to as the "moderation principle." If ΔEv is too low, the oxide becomes a very good oxidant but a poor catalyst, as it loses oxygen too easily and struggles to replenish it from the gas phase. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the oxide will be unreactive.

The ideal catalyst should have a ΔEv low enough to allow for efficient oxidation of reactants, but not so low that it becomes permanently reduced under reaction conditions. This balance ensures that the catalyst can both release oxygen to reactants and readily replenish it from the gas phase, maintaining its catalytic activity over time.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从催化剂表面移除氧原子以氧化反应物，然后从气相氧中补充这些氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

较低的ΔEv通常与对甲烷等反应物的更高反应性相关，因为它表明表面氧原子更容易被移除以参与氧化反应。然而，ΔEv存在一个最佳范围，被称为"适度原则"。如果ΔEv太低，氧化物会成为很好的氧化剂，但不是好的催化剂，因为它太容易失去氧，并且难以从气相中补充氧。相反，如果ΔEv太高，氧化物将不具反应性。

理想的催化剂应具有足够低的ΔEv，以允许有效地氧化反应物，但又不至于在反应条件下永久还原。这种平衡确保了催化剂既能向反应物释放氧，又能从气相中轻松补充氧，从而随时间保持其催化活性。
