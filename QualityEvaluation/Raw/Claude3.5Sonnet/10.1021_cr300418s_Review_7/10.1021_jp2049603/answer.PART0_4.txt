[1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy."

[2] "Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

[3] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen from the catalyst surface to oxidize the reactant, followed by the replenishment of that oxygen from the gas phase. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A moderate ΔEv is desirable for optimal catalytic performance. If ΔEv is too low, oxygen is easily removed from the surface, making it a good oxidant but a poor catalyst because it's difficult to replenish the oxygen. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the surface won't be reactive enough to facilitate the oxidation reaction.

The ease of oxygen vacancy formation correlates with the surface's reactivity towards substrate molecules (e.g., methane dissociation). Therefore, ΔEv serves as a good descriptor for predicting catalytic activity. Finding the right balance in ΔEv is key to designing effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从催化剂表面移除氧以氧化反应物，然后从气相补充该氧。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

适度的ΔEv值对于获得最佳催化性能是理想的。如果ΔEv太低，氧很容易从表面移除，使其成为良好的氧化剂，但不是好的催化剂，因为难以补充氧。相反，如果ΔEv太高，表面将不够活跃，无法促进氧化反应。

氧空位形成的容易程度与表面对底物分子（例如甲烷解离）的反应性相关。因此，ΔEv可作为预测催化活性的良好描述符。在ΔEv中找到适当的平衡是设计有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应的关键。
