          [1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy."

[2] "Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

[3] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."

[4] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, ΔEv, on Cu-, Zn-, Mg-, Fe-, or Al-doped La2O3 (001) and (011) surfaces. We found that these dopants cause a very substantial lowering of ΔEv from 6.44 eV for pure La2O3(001) to 0.52, 2.01, and 2.59 eV for La2O3(001) doped with Cu, Zn, or Mg, respectively."

[5] "Cu-doped lanthanum oxide is an example of this. The oxygen is so easy to remove that it is likely to be lost at a temperature lower than that of methane activation. This means that, under reaction conditions, the catalyst is reduced; our calculations show that the reduced CuLa2O3 does not break the CH bond efficiently."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the replenishment of these oxygen vacancies by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher reactivity towards reactants like methane, as it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface to participate in the oxidation reaction. However, there is an optimal range for ΔEv that balances reactivity with stability, known as the "moderation principle." If ΔEv is too low, the oxide becomes an excellent oxidant but a poor catalyst, as it loses oxygen too easily and struggles to replenish it from the gas phase. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the oxide is unreactive.

The ideal catalyst should have a moderate ΔEv, making it easy enough to create oxygen vacancies for oxidation reactions, but not so easy that the catalyst becomes rapidly reduced under reaction conditions. This balance ensures that the catalyst can effectively oxidize reactants while maintaining its ability to complete the catalytic cycle by replenishing lost oxygen.

Dopants can be used to tune ΔEv to achieve this balance. For example, doping La2O3 with Cu, Zn, or Mg significantly lowers ΔEv compared to the pure oxide, potentially enhancing its catalytic activity. However, the optimal dopant and doping level depend on the specific reaction conditions and desired catalytic properties. In the case of Cu-doped lanthanum oxide, the oxygen is so easily removed that the catalyst may be reduced at temperatures lower than those required for methane activation, resulting in poor catalytic performance.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从催化剂表面移除晶格氧原子以氧化反应物，然后由气相氧补充这些氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

较低的ΔEv通常与对甲烷等反应物的更高反应性相关，因为从表面移除氧参与氧化反应更容易。然而，ΔEv存在一个平衡反应性和稳定性的最佳范围，被称为"适度原则"。如果ΔEv过低，氧化物成为优秀的氧化剂但不是好的催化剂，因为它太容易失去氧并难以从气相补充。相反，如果ΔEv过高，氧化物就不具有反应性。

理想的催化剂应具有适中的ΔEv，使其易于为氧化反应创造氧空位，但又不至于在反应条件下迅速还原。这种平衡确保催化剂能有效氧化反应物，同时保持其通过补充失去的氧来完成催化循环的能力。

掺杂剂可用于调节ΔEv以达到这种平衡。例如，用Cu、Zn或Mg掺杂La2O3可显著降低ΔEv，与纯氧化物相比，可能会提高其催化活性。然而，最佳掺杂剂和掺杂水平取决于特定的反应条件和所需的催化性能。以Cu掺杂的氧化镧为例，氧的移除如此容易，以至于催化剂可能在低于甲烷活化所需的温度下就被还原，导致催化性能不佳。
