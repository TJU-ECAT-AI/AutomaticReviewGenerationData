[1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy."

[2] "Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

[3] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen from the catalyst surface to oxidize the reactant, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv makes it easier to create oxygen vacancies, which increases the oxidizing ability of the surface. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide becomes a very good oxidant but a poor catalyst, as it becomes difficult to replenish the oxygen from the gas phase. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the surface will not be reactive enough to effectively catalyze the oxidation reaction.

The ideal catalyst should have a moderate ΔEv, balancing the ease of oxygen removal with the ability to replenish the oxygen vacancy. This "moderation principle" ensures that the oxide can both effectively oxidize the reactant and maintain its catalytic activity by easily regenerating oxygen vacancies.

The ease of oxygen vacancy formation also correlates with the reactivity of the surface towards other reactions, such as methane dissociation. This relationship highlights the importance of ΔEv as a descriptor for the overall catalytic activity of oxide surfaces in various reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从催化剂表面移除氧以氧化反应物，然后由气相氧补充氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv使得创建氧空位更容易，这增加了表面的氧化能力。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物会成为一个很好的氧化剂，但不是一个好的催化剂，因为从气相补充氧变得困难。相反，如果ΔEv太高，表面将不够活跃，无法有效地催化氧化反应。

理想的催化剂应该具有适中的ΔEv，平衡氧的易移除性与补充氧空位的能力。这种"适度原则"确保氧化物既能有效地氧化反应物，又能通过容易再生氧空位来维持其催化活性。

氧空位形成的容易程度也与表面对其他反应（如甲烷解离）的反应性相关。这种关系突出了ΔEv作为氧化物表面在各种反应中整体催化活性描述符的重要性。
