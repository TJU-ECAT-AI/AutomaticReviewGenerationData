8 The Mars&ndash;Van Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Mars&ndash;van Krevelen (226) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide’s surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface). In most cases, the reoxidation of the surface is very fast, and therefore the rate-limiting step is the reaction of the reductant with the surface oxygen. We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction
where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller. However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back. Therefore, in designing an oxidation catalyst, we must follow a “moderation principle”: we should modify the surface to make ΔEv small, but not too small. (141)
For this and other reasons, there is an extensive literature in which ΔEv was calculated. (141, 142, 145, 187-189, 221, 227-262) Pirovano, Hoffmann, and Sauer (263) have written an excellent review of these calculations summarizing the situation up to 2007.
According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, (264) removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons. This means that an oxygen vacancy is a strong Lewis base. The fate of these electrons depends on whether the oxide is irreducible or reducible. Here, we say that an oxide is irreducible if the cation in it does not make an oxide in which it has a lower valence (e.g., CeO2 is reducible because Ce2O3 exists and is stable; MgO is irreducible because Mg2O does not exist). This means that the cations in the irreducible oxides will not lower their formal charge in the presence of electron donors. When an oxygen vacancy is made on the surface of an irreducible oxide, the unpaired electrons, left behind when the oxygen atom is removed, are localized at the vacancy site. (258, 260) This of course assumes that the oxide does not have electron-accepting impurities. In the presence of O2 in the gas phase, the oxygen vacancy in an irreducible oxide adsorbs O2 strongly. We expect this, because O2 is a strong Lewis acid and the vacancy is a strong Lewis base.
In the materials science literature, there have been extensive discussions regarding the charge of an oxygen vacancy in the bulk. (265-267) The model used in these discussions assumes that when the oxygen vacancy is formed the oxide is in contact with an electron reservoir whose properties are described solely by its Fermi level (chemical potential). The vacancy is in chemical equilibrium with a gas-phase oxygen reservoir and the electron reservoir. If the Fermi level of the electrons is very low, the vacancy will donate electrons to the electron reservoir and the vacancy is positively charge. In the opposite limit, it is negatively charged. The concentration of vacancies and their charge depends on oxygen pressure and temperature and on the Fermi level of the reservoir. The model is silent regarding the physical nature of the reservoir. Unless the oxide is in contact with a bulk metal, which will provide the reservoir, we must assume that the reservoir consists of impurities (electron donors or acceptors) or other “defects”. The question is whether the model is useful for the study of oxygen vacancies at the surface of an oxide. We believe that it is not, for two reasons. First, in the presence of oxygen (which is the only case of interest for oxidation catalysis), the vacancies will adsorb an O2 molecule, and this is the stable structure. Such adsorption is not relevant to bulk vacancies. Second, if the electron reservoir consists of electron donors or acceptors, the energy of vacancy formation will depend on how far the vacancy is from the nearest donor. This is a “local (chemical) effect”: the energy needed to make a vacancy near the donor is different from the energy to make it far from the donor. This means that the Fermi energy is not the only parameter in the problem. Calculations of ΔEv at different distances from various donors or acceptors show that this distance dependence if very substantial, with the oxygen atoms near the dopant being the easiest to remove. (258)
Oxygen vacancies in reducible oxides have interesting properties. They have been studied for CeO2 and TiO2, which are oxides that can change their oxidation state easily from 4+ to 3+. This means that the Ce4+ or the Ti4+ cations act as Lewis acids. Because an oxygen vacancy is a Lewis base and the cations are Lewis acids, the formation of an oxygen vacancy on these oxides is facilitated by a strong acid&ndash;base interaction. The unpaired electrons created when the vacancy is formed will occupy orbitals localized on the cations, reducing them. (188, 259, 268, 269) The oxygen atoms neighboring the reduced cation are displaced from their normal locations (which they have when the cation is Me4+). The “ensemble” consisting of the reduced ion plus the displaced oxygen atoms is called a polaron. In DFT calculations, polarons are formed only if one uses GGA+U theory, with a sufficiently high value of U (usually between 3 and 5 eV), or hybrid functionals (e.g., HSE or B3LYP).
Thus, the creation of an oxygen vacancy causes the formation of two polarons. This polaron pair can be located on any pair of cations, and we describe next how one can control these locations. We use TiO2 as an example, but the procedure can be applied to ceria and presumably to any other reducible oxide. First, one makes an oxygen vacancy in the surface and one optimizes the geometry to obtain a minimum energy. The polarons will be made at some location that is determined by the initial state prior to geometry optimization. To locate a polaron on a specific Ti atom, we displace slightly the neighboring oxygen atoms away from it and optimize the electronic energy (while keeping the oxygen atoms fixed in the displaced position). (259) After optimizing the electronic energy, we allow the oxygen atoms to adjust their position to minimize the total energy. The end result is that this particular Ti atom has the formal charge +3 and the polaron is stabilized at the desired location. One can then use the same procedure to form a second polaron (the O-vacancy provides two electrons) on another Ti atom of our choice. Polaron formation lowers the energy of vacancy formation by an amount that depends on the location of the polarons. This dependence is fairly dramatic on rutile. (259) Until recently, it was assumed that the unpaired electron reduce two Ti4+ ions located next to the oxygen vacancy, which is a plausible but incorrect. It turns out that 80 possible polaron-pair locations have been studied, (259) and all have lower energy than in the case when both electrons are located on the two Ti atoms neighboring the vacant site. Depending on the value of U, the polaron formation lowers the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy by at least 0.5 eV. (259) If one performs GGA calculations, the two unpaired electrons in TiO2(110) are spread out over several atoms surrounding the vacancy, (270) and the cations are no longer Lewis acids. As a result, the energy of vacancy formation is higher.
One of the most puzzling results of the calculations is the large magnitude of ΔEv. A few examples from our work are ΔEv = 3.3 eV for ZnO (101̅0), (271) 3.28 eV for NiO(011), 6.44 eV for La2O3(001), (145, 272) 5.77 eV for CaO(001), (145) ∼3.5 eV for TiO2(110), (259) 3.00 eV for CeO2(111), (145) and 6.38 eV for LaOCl(001). The order of magnitude of the values reported here is consistent with that reported in calculations by other authors on these and other oxides. The last step in the synthesis of almost all oxide catalysts is calcination in air or oxygen, for 4 or 5 h, at temperatures between 400 and 500 °C. The large values of ΔEv suggest that there should hardly be any oxygen vacancies on the surfaces of most oxides. However, this statement is softened if we consider the thermodynamic equilibrium between a surface with oxygen vacancies on it and gaseous oxygen. The entropy of the final state (reduced oxide plus O2 in the gas) is much larger than the entropy of the initial state (unreduced oxide), because the translational and the rotational entropies of gaseous O2 are large. (273) As a result, the entropy ΔSv of the reaction forming oxygen vacancies is positive. Because the Gibbs free energy of the reaction is ΔGv = ΔHv &ndash; TΔSv, the free energy of the reaction that makes oxygen vacancies is smaller than ΔEv. A thermodynamic calculation therefore makes vacancy formation less forbidding than a calculation of the total energy.
It is likely that stable oxides such as CaO, MgO, La2O3, or Sm2O3 do not have oxygen vacancies on their surface as long as sufficient oxygen is available during their preparation and no reductants are present. The large values of ΔEv for these oxides explain why they are so hard to reduce. It also explains why they are so popular as catalysts for the oxidative methane coupling reaction (2CH4 + O2 → C2H4 + 2H2O), which takes place above 600 °C (it is often carried out at 700&ndash;800 °C). (81, 82, 274) They are the oxides that interact with methane without combusting it. In this case, their ability to hold tightly to the oxygen atoms at their surface is an asset.
The situation is more confusing for oxides for which ΔEv is not as large. Quite a bit of information regarding oxygen vacancies is available for TiO2(110), for which one can perform high-quality STM measurements in UHV. (147, 160-162, 164, 240, 275-290) These measurements find that there are always oxygen vacancies on the surface. Their concentration can be as high as 16% (a vacancy concentration of ∼8% is more common), but achieving this requires heating at high temperature in UHV. One creates vacancies by heating TiO2 to high temperature, and one annihilates them by exposure to oxygen. These results seem inconsistent with the high values of the energy of vacancy formation.
It is very difficult to compare these numerical values of ΔEv to experimental values for real catalysts for a number of reasons. The precursors used to make oxide catalysts have a purity of 99.99%. The 0.01% impurities may segregate at the surface and change dramatically ΔEv. For example, (291-293) STM experiments found that Ca segregates on the surface of TiO2. Lefferts (115) used low-energy ion scattering experiments and showed that F, Na, Al, or Si (the mass difference is too small to decide which one), K or Ca, and Cr or Mn, from unknown sources, were present on the surface of some commercial yttrium-stabilized zirconia, while X-ray fluorescence detected the presence of Hf and Ti in the bulk. All calculations show that if these dopants are LVDs, the energy of vacancy formation will be diminished substantially. Any acidic adsorbate, such as H (in the form of hydroxyls), will also lower the energy of vacancy formation. (221) Calculations show that the value of ΔEv on different crystal faces can vary substantially. Because the grains of the catalysts are amorphous or have many facets, we can at best measure an average value of ΔEv. All of these make it difficult to compare the experimental values to those provided by calculations. The situation is complicated by the fact that experiments with “the same oxide” prepared by different methods give very different results. The temperature at which O2 starts to desorb from ceria, in temperature programmed desorption experiments, depends strongly on the dispersion of the oxide: the finer is the powder, the smaller is ΔEv. (294-298) Information about the energy of forming oxygen vacancies on ceria can also be obtained from temperature programmed reduction with H2 or CO. TPR with hydrogen gives a widespread of the light-off temperature, hence a spread in the stability of surface oxygen. (299-308) Temperature programmed reduction with CO leads to similar conclusions. (309-311) As a result, we cannot tell which measurement of ΔEv should be compared to the calculated values.
We repeat here that we are interested in the energy of oxygen vacancy formation ΔEv because it is a descriptor of the ability of an oxide to function as an oxidant. We show below that the ΔEv is strongly affected by substitutional cationic dopants.
9 Oxide Catalysts Doped with Low-Valence Dopants (LVDs)
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
9.1 Introduction
We accept the “majority view” (224, 225) that most oxidation reactions catalyzed by undoped oxides take place by a Mars&ndash;van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. This means that any oxide modification that facilitates the removal of surface oxygen will increase the efficiency of the MvK process. Because oxygen is electrophilic, we can remove it easier from the surface layer if we create an electron deficit at the surface. We propose to create this deficit by replacing some of the cations of the host oxide with cations having a lower valence.
The same strategy is suggested from another point of view. An oxygen vacancy is a Lewis base. If we make a chemical modification that creates a Lewis acid on the surface, the subsequent formation of an oxygen vacancy will benefit by a strong acid&ndash;base interaction and the energy to make a vacancy will lowered by this interaction. (221) Doping with an LVD creates a Lewis acid on the surface and therefore facilitates oxygen vacancy formation and increases the binding energy of Lewis bases to the surface.
Because the presence of an LVD in the surface layer makes it easier to make oxygen vacancies, the oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are also more reactive; an oxide doped with an LVD is a better oxidant than the undoped oxide. However, it is important to keep in mind that a better oxidant is not necessarily a better oxidation catalyst.
In addition, because a surface doped with an LVD is a Lewis acid, it will bind strongly Lewis bases, such as H or CH3. (221, 312) It follows that doping with an LVD will increase the energy of the dissociative adsorption of an alkane because the fragments produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and they interact strongly with the Lewis acid surface. This makes such surfaces promising candidates for breaking the C&ndash;H bond in alkanes. If the Brønsted&ndash;Evans&ndash;Polanyi rule (313-326) holds for alkane activation on doped oxides, increasing the binding energy of the fragments to the surface leads to lower activation energy for dissociation.
9.2 The Effect of LVDs on the Energy of Oxygen-Vacancy Formation
A large number of calculations studied the chemical effects of doping an oxide surface with an LVD. (141, 142, 145, 190, 228, 234, 238, 243, 258, 260, 261, 271, 272, 327-339) We enumerate below the conclusions of these calculations and propose that these are general and valid for any oxide doped with any LVD.
(a) The energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy near the location of an LVD is much smaller than ΔEv for the undoped oxide. Doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped host.
(b) The presence of an LVD affects oxygen atoms several sites away from the dopant, making them easier to remove than those of the undoped oxide. The oxygen atom easiest to remove is adjacent to the dopant. (258)
(c) The presence of an LVD makes the doped oxide a strong Lewis acid. (221) As a result, the bond of any Lewis base (e.g., H, CH3, NH3, CO) with the oxygen atoms in the surface layer of the doped oxide is much stronger than the same bond with the undoped oxide.
(d) The adsorption of a Lewis base on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD will tend to cancel the properties conferred by the dopant, as if the base neutralizes the acidity caused by the LVD. We have called this a chemical compensation effect. (145) The compensation effect may play an important role in alkane activation. When the C&ndash;H bond is broken by dissociative adsorption on an oxide surface doped with an LVD, the fragments (H and CH3) are Lewis bases. They neutralize the effect of the dopant (whose presence makes the surface an acid) making the activity of the doped oxide comparable to that of the undoped oxide. The activity of the doped oxide is restored only after H and CH3 are removed from the surface by subsequent chemistry. This raises the possibility that in some cases the limiting step will be the rate of this removal. Otsuka et al. (340) and Sokolovskii et al. (341) suggested that their experiments support this idea.
In what follows, we present some of the computational results that were extrapolated to formulate these rules.
Early examples of low-valence dopants dealt with very stable oxides (e.g., alkali-earth oxides, La2O3, Sm2O3) doped with alkali atoms, which catalyze oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene. We do not discuss this system here because excellent recent reviews are available. (81, 82) In addition, it is doubtful that the doped oxides catalyzing this reaction are stable under the reaction conditions used for oxidative methane coupling (very high temperature).
In our earliest work, (141) we have shown that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in the surface layer of rutile TiO2(110) is substantially diminished by substitutional doping with, Au, Cu, Ag, Ni, Pd, or Pt. Similar results were obtained for CeO2 doped with Au, (142, 243, 261, 329, 338) Ag, (142) Cu, (142, 228, 334, 335, 339) La, (145, 331, 332) Y, (190, 258) Fe, (329, 333) Al, (190) Sc, (190) Mn, (342) and In. (190) This behavior is not confined to ceria. The same conclusion was reached in studies of ZnO (271) doped with Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag, Au; of La2O3(100) and La2O3(011) doped with Cu, Zn, Mg; (260, 272) of CaO doped with Li, Na, or K; (145) of NiO doped with alkali (Sun and Metiu, in preparation); and of TiO2 doped with Fe, (234) Au, Ag, Cu, Ni. (141) We are not aware of any exception to this rule. For this reason, we postulated that the rule is valid for any oxide doped with any LVD.
In all cases, the lowering of ΔEv by the presence of an LVD is substantial. We give below a few examples.
(i) The computed energy ΔEv of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surfaces of very stable oxides, such as CaO, MgO, or La2O3, is very large. For example, the surface of La2O3(001) has six-coordinated and four-coordinated oxygen atoms exposed to the vacuum. The energy to make a vacancy on this surface is (260) 6.44 eV (for the four-coordinated O) and 5.77 eV (for the six-coordinated O). Doping La2O3(001) with an LVD lowers the energy needed for removing a four-coordinated O atom to ∼0.58 eV for a Cu dopant, to ∼2.38 eV for a Zn dopant, and to ∼2.57 eV for a Mg dopant. A collapse in ΔEv of the same order of magnitude was obtained for the energy of removing a six-coordinated O atom from the doped surface. The same behavior was observed for La2O3(001) (260) and other very stable, irreducible oxides such as MgO (258) and CaO. It is likely that the same results will be observed for other stable oxides such as Sm2O3, alkali earth oxides, Al2O3, SiO2.
(ii) The decrease of ΔEv by low-valence dopants, in less stable oxides (e.g., CeO2, TiO2, NiO, ZnO), is also large but not as dramatic as at (i). For example, the energy of vacancy formation on CeO2(111) is ∼3.00 eV. (258) For CeO2(111) doped with La, ΔEv ≈ 1.36 eV; (145) with Y, ΔEv ≈ 1.06 eV; (258) with Fe, ΔEv ≈ 2.73 eV. (234, 333) This behavior is not caused by the fact that CeO2 is a reducible oxide. Calculations in our group have shown that doping NiO(011), which is not reducible, with Li reduces ΔEv from 3.28 to 2.65 eV. The lowering of ΔEv is a consistent trend. However, there is no qualitative explanation for the differences in ΔEv between samples having the same host oxide and different dopants that have the same valence (e.g., CeO2 doped with In, Ga, Al). Some correlations have been found between the magnitude of ΔEv and other properties (e.g., the energy of formation of the oxide of the dopant, or the cation&ndash;oxygen bond length of the oxide of the dopant). However, most of them have been tested only on a small number of systems.
(iii) The ability of a dopant to affect ΔEv may vary with the crystalline face of the guest oxide. In the case of La2O3, we found relatively small differences between the ΔEv on the (011) and the (001) face. Large differences have been observed for ceria doped with Au. (261, 338) The manner in which the effect of an LVD varies from one crystal face to another has not been sufficiently explored, and no qualitative explanation for these differences has been proposed.
(iv) In the literature on materials chemistry, it is often stated that doping with an LVD will generate spontaneously an oxygen vacancy for “charge compensation”. This view is reinforced by measurements that show that an oxide doped with an LVD (in the bulk) has more oxygen vacancies and higher oxygen mobility than the undoped oxide. The calculations show that for the majority of oxides whose surface is doped with an LVD, the formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer is endoergic. Often the magnitude of ΔEv ranges between 1 and 2.5 eV, which means that doping with an LVD facilitates the formation of an oxygen vacancy, but oxygen vacancies are not made spontaneously. However, for some crystalline faces of some oxides, with some LVDs in the surface layer, ΔEv is positive (the oxygen vacancy formation is exoergic). This happens, for example, for ceria doped with Au. (142, 261) This spontaneous vacancy formation is more likely to be observed when the valence of the dopant is lower by 2 or 3 than the valence of the cation it replaces.
The number of oxygen vacancies at a surface (or in the bulk) of an oxide doped with an LVD depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen gas and the temperature of the surface used during the preparation of the oxide. For this reason, some workers use thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, (335, 343) in computations that examine oxygen-vacancy formation. This is useful for characterizing the “as-prepared” catalyst, which is likely to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the oxygen gas present during calcination. However, catalytic reactions are run under steady-state conditions, not at equilibrium. The surface is exposed simultaneously to an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O, H2O2) and a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2). The reductant makes vacancies, and the oxidant annihilates them. The steady-state concentration of vacancies is controlled by the interplay between the rate of vacancy formation and that of vacancy annihilation and can be very different from the concentration at equilibrium between oxygen gas and the oxide surface. For example, in alkane oxidation, the surface is reduced by the alkane and oxidized by the gas-phase oxygen (or whatever oxidant is used). At high alkane partial pressure and low oxidant pressure, the catalyst surface is likely to be reduced (a surface with many oxygen vacancies). In the opposite limit, the surface is close to being fully oxidized. If we use CO2 as an oxidant, the surface has substantially more oxygen vacancies than in the case when the oxidant is O2. In all cases, the oxygen leaving the surface, to make a vacancy, comes off as H2O, or CO, or CO2, etc. Forming oxygen vacancies by using a reductant is much more favorable energetically than desorbing surface oxygen atom as O2. The fact that ΔEv is 2 eV or higher does not mean that there are no vacancies on the surface because much energy is gained if the surface oxygen is removed by formation of water (rather than 1/2O2) or by formation of CO2 (in a reaction with CO).
9.3 The Presence of an LVD Makes the Surface More Reactive
9.3.1 General Comments
One of the guiding rules in working with doped oxide catalysts is that the easier it is to remove a surface oxygen atom, the more reactive is that atom. If this is true, a surface doped with LVDs ought to be more reactive than the undoped surfaces. We show below that this is the case.
Because doping with an LVD turns the oxide surface into a Lewis acid, the oxygen on the surface of such oxide will bind strongly Lewis bases. This means that the presence of the LVD will activate the oxygen to bind more strongly CO, H, or an alkyl (which are Lewis bases). In particular, the doped surface will break a C&ndash;H in an alkane because the fragments formed by dissociation are Lewis bases.
Calculations confirm these qualitative rules. For example, rutile TiO2(110) doped with Au is a much better CO oxidant than the undoped rutile. (141) This early work made a number of observations about CO oxidation catalyzed by oxides doped with LVDs that are likely to be general. (333, 334, 338, 339, 342) It showed that CO reacts with a surface oxygen atom located near the dopant to form a Os&ndash;CO group (Os is an oxygen atom in the surface layer) whose C&ndash;O bond lengths are close to those of CO2. CO binds most strongly to the oxygen atom that is easiest to remove. The CO2 molecule formed in this way desorbs easily from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. Because the vacancy is a Lewis base and gaseous O2 is a Lewis acid, our rules suggest that the vacancy adsorbs O2 readily. Moreover, the vacancy donates electrons to the adsorbed O2, weakening the O&ndash;O bond. The calculations show that this is true: O2 adsorbed at the vacancy site reacts readily with CO and forms a “carbonate”, which is easily decomposed to form CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy. The last step closes the catalytic cycle. This is a typical Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism. The role of the LVD is to make the surface oxygen atom more reactive; it is not the ionic dopant that is the active site. Therefore, these calculations provide no support for the old idea that one should think of doping with an LVD as a way of tuning the activity of the dopant (e.g., that a Ni dopant will do catalytic chemistry similar to that of metallic Ni but modified by being imbedded in the surface of the oxide).
9.3.2 Methane Activation: Does the Brønsted&ndash;Evans&ndash;Polanyi Rule Work For It?
A more interesting reaction is the activation of alkanes for conversion to syngas, alkenes, or valuable oxygenates. An appealing feature of such reactions, as far as computational screening is concerned, is that the rate-limiting step is the breaking of the C&ndash;H bond. Therefore, one can screen the ability of a catalyst for activating methane by calculating the activation energy for this step. Such calculations can help us find active catalysts but tell us nothing about selectivity because this would require computing the activation energies for all possible steps in alkane oxidation. Because such calculations would be extremely time-consuming, our strategy has been to use computations to find catalysts that break the C&ndash;H easily and then perform experiments to determine what products are formed.
Aside from the early work on oxidative methane coupling by doped oxides, Mayernik and Janik (229, 344) seem to be the first to have used computations to calculate the activation energy for methane activation by a doped oxide. They showed that CeO2 doped with Pd or Zr is a better methane activation catalyst than ceria. Subsequent work showed that the same is true for La2O3 doped with Cu, Mg, or Zn (272) and for ceria doped with Pt. (337) We propose that, in general, oxides doped with low-valence atoms are better alkane activation catalysts than the undoped oxides. We need however to qualify this statement. In most cases, alkane activation takes place with a useful conversion at temperatures above 400 °C. If the dopant makes the surface oxygen too easy to remove, then the doped oxide in contact with a reductant (CO, H2, an alkane) may lose the activated oxygen at a temperature that is lower than that of C&ndash;H bond activation. This is more likely to happen when the oxidant is CO2 than when it is O2. In this case, the oxide is reduced at the reaction temperature, and this reduced oxide might or might not be a good oxidation catalyst. Experiments underway in our group show that this is the case for dry reforming of methane by Ru-doped ceria: the catalyst is the reduced oxide. We believe that this is the case because pulsing O2 through the system under steady-state reaction conditions reduces the methane conversion.
An interesting example of alkane activation by oxides doped with an LVD is provided by Zn-doped La2O3(001). The undoped oxide reacts with methane at very high temperatures, close to those at which CH4 dissociates into H and CH3 in the gas phase. The DFT calculations show that dissociative adsorption of CH4 is extremely exothermic (4.45 eV). (145) The dissociative chemisorption of methane on Zn-doped La2O3(001) is slightly exoergic. In Figure 3, we show the two lowest energy states of the dissociated methane on this system (all other binding schemes we have studied have higher energies). In Figure 3a, the H and CH3 fragments bind to surface oxygen atoms neighboring the Zn dopant. In Figure 3b, CH3 binds to the dopant and H to an oxygen atom nearby. In what follows, we call these states 3a and 3b. In Table 2, we give the dissociation energies and the activation energies (calculated with the NEB method) for reaching 3a and 3b. Clearly the presence of the dopant has a dramatic effect on the reaction energy and on the activation energy for CH4 dissociation. The table also shows the distance dCH between the carbon atom in the adsorbed CH3 radical and the hydrogen atom forming the hydroxyl. This is relevant because of a very simple rule that we use for a preliminary screening of the activation energy for reaching various possible product state. The activation energy of a bond-breaking reaction is lowered when the fragments are able to start making bonds with the surface before one stretches too much the bond to be ruptured. This allows us to eliminate a priori final states in which the distance between the chemisorbed fragments is substantially larger than the length of the bond to be ruptured. Table 2 indicates that the distance dCH between the fragments in 3b is smaller than that in 3a. According to the rule just stated, the activation energy for reaching 3b should be smaller than that for reaching 3a, and it is. This runs counter to the Brønsted&ndash;Evans&ndash;Polanyi rule, which states that the activation energy is controlled by the binding energy of the final state. In the present example, the state 3a is bound more strongly to the surface than 3b, but the activation energy to reach 3a is higher.
aΔEr is the reaction energy, Ea is the activation energy, and dCH is the distance between the C atom in the chemisorbed CH3 and the H atom in the hydroxyl formed by disociation.
9.4 The Electronic Structure of an Oxide Doped with an LVD
Chemists often use orbital energies and shapes to explain qualitatively the properties of chemical bonds. While there is no rigorous theoretical justification for such analysis, extensive experience shows that it often provides a useful rationalization of the experimental or computational results.
The most relevant change, when an oxide is doped with an LVD, is the appearance of an empty orbital (hole) in the valence band; the LVD is a p-type dopant. This hole is responsible for the acidity of the doped oxide: when a Lewis base binds to the doped oxide, it donates an electron, which fills the hole. The energy gained in this hole-filling process contributes to the increase in the binding energy of the base.
A much-debated question is whether the empty orbital is located around one oxygen atom (the hole is localized) or it is spread over many oxygen atoms neighboring the dopant (the hole is delocalized) or over the whole solid (the hole is completely delocalized). The answer to this question may be important: a localized hole converts (formally) an O2&ndash; into an O&ndash;, and a chemist will think, rightfully, that O&ndash; is more reactive than O2&ndash;.
We have detailed information on this issue for Al-doped α-SiO2 (smoky quartz). Al atoms are a common impurity in silica, and they are low-valence dopants. In what follows, we denote Al and the four atoms bound to it by the symbol [AlO4h]0, where h signifies the presence of a hole caused by the replacement of a tetravalent Si atom with a trivalent Al atom. The superscript 0 indicates that the AlO4 group is electrically neutral. GGA-DFT calculations on this system found that the hole is delocalized over the four oxygen atoms neighboring Al. (327, 345-347) Calculations on SiO2 clusters doped with Al and capped with H atoms, (348-350) which allow the use of more reliable methods of computation, show that the hole is localized on one oxygen atom. This localization breaks the tetrahedral symmetry: one of the oxygen atoms is closer to Al than the other three. This is the oxygen atom on which the hole is localized. In particular, Pacchioni et al. (350) have calculated the coupling parameters in the EPR Hamiltonian and obtained results that are close to the experimental ones. (351-353)
Prompted by this situation, Nolan and Watson (328) proposed that whenever hole formation is suspected (e.g., when an LVD is present), one should use DFT+UO where UO is a U parameter for oxygen (in addition to the more common U parameter for the cations). They varied the value of UO to obtain a distorted geometry for [AlO4h]0 and localize the hole on one of the oxygen atom. They found that UO = 7 eV gives the desired result and smaller values of UO do not. Subsequently, they recommended that UO = 7 eV should be used by all studies of oxides containing low-valence dopants. (190, 328, 330, 332) One would infer that if U for oxygen is needed when an LVD is present, it should also be used in calculations on undoped oxides. We are not aware of any work in which such a procedure was used.
To better understand what is involved, we summarize some of the facts about the [AlO4h] system, presented in several review articles. (351-353) [AlO4h] is not normally present in smoky quartz; instead, one has either AlO4H or AlO4Li. This is not a surprise because Al-doped siliceous zeolites are well-known to always come with a “charge compensating ion”. This is in keeping with the “chemical compensation” concept (145) that proposes that whenever a surface is a Lewis acid, like the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, energy is gained if a Lewis base binds to it. H and Li are the Lewis bases available when the quartz is synthesized, and, as a result, AlO4H or AlO4Li is present in the material. One has to resort to extreme measures to prepare [AlO4h]0: irradiate Al-doped silica (351-353) for a long time with X-rays, or electrons, or γ-rays, or neutrons, or heat the silica sample for 10 h at 1400 °C, and a pressure of ∼10&ndash;3 Torr. (354) After one of these procedures is used, EPR measurements confirm that the oxygen geometry around Al is distorted and a localized hole (an O&ndash;) is present. Schnadt and Schneider, (352) however, found that the EPR spectrum disappears at a temperature above 170 K because the hole moves rapidly from one oxygen atom to another. It was estimated that the barrier preventing this motion is ∼0.03 eV. This means that at the temperatures at which catalysis takes place, the hole is very mobile and the total energy difference between a system with a localized hole and one with a delocalized hole is very small. At the temperatures used in catalysis, the localization or the delocalization of the hole is an irrelevant issue. We are therefore of the opinion that one should not use a UO parameter for oxygen if the reason is to localize the hole, because this will alter all other results of the computation.
The question is whether the same small localization energy is observed in other systems. Chrétien has performed calculations on La-doped ceria and found that one can obtain a hole localized on oxygen by performing PBE-GGA as follows. Perform the electronic-energy optimization with a geometry in which one O atom is slightly shifted toward the La dopant to break the symmetry. After the electronic energy is optimized, release the constraint on O positions and optimize both the electronic energy and the geometry. The final state obtained by this procedure maintains the distorted structure, and the hole in this state is localized on two oxygen atoms (forming a polaron). A PBE-GGA starting with symmetric oxygen positions will maintain symmetry and will produce a delocalized hole. The energy difference between the two states is 0.03 eV; within the accuracy of DFT these states are equally probable. Chrétien has also performed calculations of the binding energy of hydrogen to various O atoms on the La-doped Ce(111) surface. The binding energies when using for oxygen UO = 7 eV (recommended by Nolan and Watson) differ from those obtained by using UO = 0 eV. This difference is of ∼0.7 eV, which is much larger than the localization energy. By using UO for oxygen, we are correcting an unimportant (i.e., small) energy error (that of localization) and causing large energy changes in a quantity (H-binding energy) that is important to chemistry. We do not know whether the binding energy obtained when UO is used is more accurate than the one obtained when UO = 0. Given this situation, we think that one should not use U for oxygen. However, this is an open question, and it will surely be taken up again in the future.
9.5 Comparison with Experiments
We have already pointed out many of the difficulties related to comparing these calculations with experiments: we do not know to what extent the materials we prepare are similar to the models used by the calculation. The qualitative conclusion from calculations is that doping with an LVD in the surface layer will make the doped oxide a better oxidant than the undoped oxide. This means that we expect that temperature programmed desorption of oxygen, temperature programmed reduction by CO or H2, and the light-off temperature for alkane activation will occur at lower temperature for an oxide doped with an LVD than for the undoped host oxide. We give here a few examples to emphasize the difficulties we encounter. Qiao et al. (355) prepared FexCe1&ndash;xO2 and showed that, as long as x is less than 0.2, CO oxidation and CH4 oxidation start (in TPR experiments) at lower temperature than on either CeO2 or Fe2O3. At a given temperature, the conversion by the doped oxide catalyst is higher than on either one of the undoped oxides. This is what one expects from calculations. Wilkes et al. (356) studied methane oxidation by ceria doped with trivalent La, Pr, and Gd and found that all of these dopants facilitate methane oxidation. This is another success for the calculations. However, Wilkes et al. (357) tested the same doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation and found that doping inhibits the reaction: the doped oxide is less reactive than the undoped one. This is not what calculations suggest. These two reactions are carried out at different temperatures, and CO and CH4 have different “reducing power” so it is likely that the surface of the doped oxide catalyst under reaction conditions is not the same for the two reactions.
Zhao and Gorte have presented results on alkane combustion on doped and undoped ceria, which seem to be at odds with what is inferred from computations on other doped-oxide systems as well as with other measurements on doped ceria. In a study of n-butane combustion catalyzed by ceria and by Me0.2Ce0.8O2 with Me = Yb, Y, Sm, Gd, La, Nb, Ta, or Pr, Zhao and Gorte (96) found that all doped-ceria oxides are less efficient than the undoped ceria, except for Zr0.2Ce0.8O2 whose activity is comparable to that of ceria. The difference in rate (measured in a differential reactor and given in units of molecules/(s m2)) is a factor of ∼100, and it is well outside the margin of error of the experiments. The amount of oxygen that can be removed by reacting with CO is larger on the undoped ceria than in the doped one, contrary to what the rules on LVDs’ effects would suggest. Another “anomaly” is that all doped-ceria samples had a smaller area per gram than ceria, contrary to what is frequently observed on other doped oxide systems. Note that some of the dopants are LVDs, some are HVDs, and one is an FVD; nevertheless, they all lower the rate of the combustion reaction. This is not what one would expect from theory. Zhao and Gorte (358) focused next on the combustion of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane on Sm0.2Ce0.8O2. They found that doping with Sm does not affect the rate of combustion of methane and ethane but lowers the rate of combustion of propane and n-butane. This is not what one would expect if one extrapolates what is known from calculations on other systems. It is however unwise to conclude that calculations are misleading without performing detailed calculations on these specific systems. We note that all dopants used in these studies form very stable and unreactive oxides, and therefore it is possible that they formed (during calcination) small unreactive oxide clusters at the surface, blocking ceria reactive sites. It is also conceivable that the LVDs used as dopants facilitate the removal of the oxygen from ceria: the catalyst is then the reduced oxide, and this may be less active than ceria.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cyclic process involving the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. This mechanism consists of two main steps:

1. The reactant molecule (e.g., CO, CH4) is oxidized by lattice oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, regenerating the catalyst surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher catalytic activity [10.1021/jp071671n]. This is because it's easier to remove oxygen from the surface, facilitating the oxidation reaction. For example, doping ceria with Zr reduces ΔEv by about 20%, enhancing its catalytic activity [10.1016/j.susc.2008.01.013].

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv is directly related to the oxide's oxidizing power. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide can more readily release oxygen, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent [10.1021/jp073424].

3. Surface reactivity: Different crystal planes of the same oxide can have varying ΔEv values, leading to different reactivities. For instance, in ceria, the order of reactivity is (110) > (100) > (111), corresponding to increasing ΔEv values [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.06.008].

4. Dopant effects: Doping can significantly alter ΔEv, thus modifying the catalytic properties of the oxide. For example, doping TiO2 with Au or Fe decreases ΔEv, enhancing its oxidation activity [10.1021/jp911851h].

5. Reaction mechanisms: The ease of oxygen vacancy formation influences the preferred reaction pathways. Lower ΔEv can facilitate certain mechanistic steps, such as CO oxidation without activation energy in Ru-doped ceria [10.1021/jp210864].

6. Catalyst stability: While lower ΔEv generally enhances activity, extremely low values may lead to over-reduction of the catalyst, potentially causing structural instability or loss of active sites [10.1021/jp103604b].

7. Oxygen mobility: Lower ΔEv often corresponds to higher oxygen mobility within the oxide lattice, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity [10.1140/epjb\_e2010-00295-x].

However, it's important to note that an optimal ΔEv value is desired for balancing high catalytic activity with catalyst stability and regeneration ability. This concept is referred to as the "moderation principle" [10.1021/jp301341].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of ΔEv in oxide catalysis open up several avenues for future research and development:

1. Rational catalyst design: By understanding the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic performance, researchers can design more efficient catalysts through strategic doping or surface engineering. This could lead to the development of highly active and selective catalysts for various industrial processes.

2. Advanced computational screening: The use of ΔEv as a descriptor for catalytic activity enables high-throughput computational screening of potential catalyst materials. This approach could significantly accelerate the discovery of novel oxide catalysts for specific reactions.

3. In-situ characterization techniques: Developing methods to measure ΔEv under reaction conditions could provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of catalysts during operation. This could lead to a better understanding of catalyst deactivation mechanisms and inform strategies for improving catalyst longevity.

4. Nanostructured catalysts: Exploring the interplay between nanoparticle size, shape, and ΔEv could lead to the design of catalysts with optimized surface-to-bulk ratios and exposed crystal facets for enhanced activity and selectivity.

5. Multifunctional catalysts: Combining oxides with different ΔEv values in composite materials could create synergistic effects, potentially leading to catalysts capable of performing multiple reactions in one-pot processes.

6. Sustainable catalysis: The insights gained from studying ΔEv could be applied to develop more energy-efficient catalytic processes, contributing to greener chemical production methods and environmental remediation technologies.

7. Bridging the materials gap: Correlating ΔEv with macroscopic catalyst properties could help bridge the gap between atomic-scale understanding and real-world catalyst performance, leading to more predictive models for catalyst design and optimization.

These future directions highlight the potential for ΔEv-based research to drive significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, with far-reaching implications for chemical manufacturing, energy production, and environmental protection.
