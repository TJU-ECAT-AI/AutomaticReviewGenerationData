The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is a fundamental concept in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. This mechanism describes a cyclic process where lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates directly in the oxidation of reactants, creating oxygen vacancies that are subsequently replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The dynamics of this process are intricate, involving the transfer of lattice oxygen to the reactant, followed by the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies within the catalyst. These vacancies play a crucial role in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is a key parameter that influences the catalytic performance, as it dictates the ease with which lattice oxygen can be removed and replenished. Catalysts with lower ΔEv values generally exhibit higher activity and better surface oxidizing ability, as they can more readily participate in the redox cycle. However, an optimal balance must be struck, as excessively low ΔEv can lead to over-oxidation of reactants or structural instability of the catalyst. Understanding and manipulating the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the associated ΔEv is essential for designing more efficient and selective oxide catalysts for a wide range of oxidation reactions.
