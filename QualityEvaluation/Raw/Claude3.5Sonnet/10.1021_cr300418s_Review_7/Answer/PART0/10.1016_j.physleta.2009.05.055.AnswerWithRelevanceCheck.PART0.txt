          [1] "Ceria is one of the most interesting oxides industrially because it can readily create oxygen vacancies and whereby Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+. This property gives ceria its high oxygen storage capacity as well as its catalytic properties;"

[2] "Knowing the local structure, clustering properties and mobility of the oxygen vacancies on surfaces of ceria is of paramount importance for understanding their catalytic roles, both in the context of supported noble metals and in relation to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria."

[3] "Daturi et al. [10] found that the deNOx activity (i.e. the ability to remove nitrogen oxides, NOx, namely NO2, NO, N2O) of oxide-based catalysts such as ceria can be correlated to the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies present at the surface."

[4] "Daturi et al. [10] proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on CeO2 surfaces, where the two oxygen atoms of two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies, thus acting as reoxidizing agents on the prereduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms combine to give rise to a N2 molecule."

[5] "The formation energy (ΔEv) for a single surface oxygen vacancy calculated using Eq. (2) is 2.10 eV"

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in this mechanism, and the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

For ceria specifically, its ability to readily create oxygen vacancies, where Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+, gives it high oxygen storage capacity and catalytic properties. The local structure, clustering properties, and mobility of these oxygen vacancies on ceria surfaces are crucial for understanding its catalytic roles.

The ΔEv influences several aspects of the catalyst's performance:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation and healing of oxygen vacancies.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ΔEv relates to the oxide's oxidizing power. A higher ΔEv suggests stronger metal-oxygen bonds, which can translate to stronger oxidizing ability but may reduce the ease of vacancy formation.

3. Oxygen storage capacity: For ceria, its high oxygen storage capacity is directly related to its ability to form and heal oxygen vacancies.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The ΔEv affects the likelihood of certain reaction pathways. For example, in NO dissociation on ceria, two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies, with oxygen atoms acting as reoxidizing agents and nitrogen atoms combining to form N2.

5. Surface reactivity: The ease of vacancy formation, determined by ΔEv, affects the overall reactivity of the oxide surface towards various adsorbates and reactants.

The concentration of surface oxygen vacancies correlates with the deNOx activity of oxide-based catalysts like ceria. An optimal ΔEv is crucial for balancing catalytic activity and oxidizing ability in oxide catalysts.

          Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧原子的参与。氧空位在这个机制中起着关键作用，而氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。

具体到氧化铈，它容易创造氧空位的能力，即Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+，赋予了它高氧储存能力和催化特性。这些氧空位在氧化铈表面的局部结构、聚集特性和移动性对于理解其催化作用至关重要。

ΔEv影响催化剂性能的几个方面：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许更容易形成和愈合氧空位。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv与氧化物的氧化能力有关。较高的ΔEv表明金属-氧键更强，这可能转化为更强的氧化能力，但可能降低空位形成的容易程度。

3. 氧储存能力：对于氧化铈，其高氧储存能力直接与其形成和愈合氧空位的能力有关。

4. 反应机理：ΔEv影响某些反应途径的可能性。例如，在氧化铈上的NO分解中，两个NO分子填充两个相邻的氧空位，氧原子作为再氧化剂，而氮原子结合形成N2。

5. 表面反应性：由ΔEv决定的空位形成的容易程度影响氧化物表面对各种吸附物和反应物的整体反应性。

表面氧空位的浓度与氧化铈等氧化物基催化剂的脱硝活性相关。最佳的ΔEv对于平衡氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。
