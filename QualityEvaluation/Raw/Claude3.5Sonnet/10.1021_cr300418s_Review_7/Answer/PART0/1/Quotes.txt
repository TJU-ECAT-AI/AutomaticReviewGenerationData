"A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

"The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

"The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface."

"We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

"Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide."

[1] "Oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are both reduction processes on ceria, specifically causing the reduction of surface metal atoms."

[2] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment."

[3] "We report the energies of oxygen vacancy formation for each surface, the preferred adsorption mode and sites for methane adsorption, and the dissociative methane adsorption energy."

[4] "Figure 7 shows the dissociative adsorption energy of methane plotted versus vacancy formation energy for each surface investigated."

[5] "The general trend between the energetics of vacancy formation and methane adsorption, however, suggests that the energy of methane adsorption on ceria surfaces is dependent on surface reducibility."

[6] "Dissociative methane adsorption proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical transition state in which a metal atom of the surface is reduced by a single electron. The activation barrier for this step, therefore, also correlates with the surface reducibility measured by the oxygen vacancy formation energy."

[1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2"

[2] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

[3] "Indeed, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[4] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[5] "Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox activity [13,14]."

[6] "Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly active and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation stream reforming of ethanol. The promotion effect was partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure ceria [20,21]."

"It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

"It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

"It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Mars–van Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."

[1] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[2] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeO(2-x)+x/2mO2(g)-mCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."

[3] "Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs."

[4] "Note that, as in the case of the formation energetics of the bulk oxides, the LDA+U value seems to be in better agreement with the experiments (4.7-5.0 eV from Table 1 in Ref. 23 and references therein) than the GGA+U result."

[1] "The positive role of oxygen vacancy defects on reduced oxide surfaces has been stressed."

[2] "In the case of CO oxidation by Au clusters supported on Fe-doped TiO2, the experiments provide clear indication that the main effect due to the presence of Fe is likely to facilitate O vacancy formation"

[3] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation (Ef) has been calculated as [...] All energies are obtained at the corresponding computational level, as described in Table 1. The calculated Ef values range between 4.5 and 5.3 eV"

[4] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase. However, the perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."

[5] "The present results provide compelling evidence that the presence of Fe strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface. This conclusion is likely to be much less dependent on the theoretical method used to describe the electronic structure of these materials"

[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas."

          [2] "As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

          [3] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it."

          [4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst."

[1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

          [2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[4] "We observe an interesting result that the vacancy formation energies do not follow the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces, as measured by the surface energy; thus, the (110) surface has the lowest vacancy formation energy."

[5] "It is generally taken to be the case that less stable surfaces will be more favourable for the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active."

[6] "For the calculation of the surface vacancy formation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems which contain Ce—these species need to be described by a consistent approach—and GGA-DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are correctly described by GGA-DFT."

[1] "We assume that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "The formation and the annihilation of the oxygen vacancies are critical steps in this Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and this suggests that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv) might be a good descriptor of the catalytic properties of doped oxides."

[3] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[4] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv. These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."

[5] "Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve."

[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis. However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be oxidised to CO2."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT. This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation energies are thus an underestimation."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

[5] "Knowledge of the mechanism of these reactions, their energetics and any surface sensitivity would be of great help in developing and optimising new ceria-containing catalysts."

[1] "Ceria is one of the most interesting oxides industrially because it can readily create oxygen vacancies and whereby Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+. This property gives ceria its high oxygen storage capacity as well as its catalytic properties;"

[2] "Knowing the local structure, clustering properties and mobility of the oxygen vacancies on surfaces of ceria is of paramount importance for understanding their catalytic roles, both in the context of supported noble metals and in relation to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria."

[3] "Daturi et al. [10] found that the deNOx activity (i.e. the ability to remove nitrogen oxides, NOx, namely NO2, NO, N2O) of oxide-based catalysts such as ceria can be correlated to the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies present at the surface."

[4] "Daturi et al. [10] proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on CeO2 surfaces, where the two oxygen atoms of two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies, thus acting as reoxidizing agents on the prereduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms combine to give rise to a N2 molecule."

[5] "The formation energy (ΔEv) for a single surface oxygen vacancy calculated using Eq. (2) is 2.10 eV"

[1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

          [2] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

          [3] "In the case of CeO2 nanorods, the more reactive planes are exposed. Moreover, the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates the reactive planes can be well protected. Thus a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate better catalytic performance during reaction."

"The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

          "Upon reduction of ceria, CeIV ions are formally reduced to CeIII, Eq. (1), and it is expected that these ions will be localised around the oxygen vacancy sites."

          "For the present study, we consider the electronic structure of the partially reduced (100) surface. To enable investigation of the oxygen vacancy a 2 × 2 expansion of the pure (100) surface was created with two vacancies, one on each of the surfaces, thus ensuring that the slab has no net dipole moment, Fig. 5."

          "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."

"We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

"In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."

"We find that the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."

"To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase, costs 3.00 eV. [...] For the Pt-doped ceria, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV."

"It is suspected that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

[1] "The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of CeO, is partially reduced by CO."

[2] "It is assumed that CO reacts directly with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form bidentate carbonate species, and then the bidentate carbonate species as an intermediate are converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species"

[3] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively"

[4] "CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et aZ.20*2r Their results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain CO oxidation on CeO,."

[5] "The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, but the more important reason for CO oxidation at room temperature should be the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO to be oxidized easily."

"An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

"We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."

"However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

"We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive. In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there. One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxygen vacancy in the surface."

[1] "Formation of surface oxygen vacancies is easily achieved through ion bombardment or controlled thermal annealing and quenching. The ease with which oxygen vacancies can be formed is thought to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2, since this creates reactive sites into which molecules can adsorb."

[2] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."

[3] "Since O-deficient surfaces possess an electron excess, these defect states constitute frontier orbitals, and are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules."

[4] "TiO2 has potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, (3-5) gas sensor devices, (6) and photocatalysis, (7-10) where surface defects are active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of molecules."

[5] "Surface energies increase as Esurf(110) < Esurf(100) < Esurf(101) < Esurf(001), while vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101), demonstrating only weak correlation between surface stability and oxygen lability."

[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En=ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively."

[4] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

[5] "For the reduced surfaces, the Ce 4f states are partially occupied. The conductivity and chemical properties are expected to be modified by the creation of O vacancies."

[6] "These defective surfaces with significant changes in surface structure are expected to be more active towards foreign incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces."

[7] "Our surface En values in Table II are all lower than our bulk value. This is in agreement with earlier empirical interaction model calculations, which suggested that a vacancy defect is more stable at the surface than within the bulk."

[1] "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide's surface."

[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

[3] "If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process."

[4] "A good dopant should activate the surface oxygen but not by too much."

[5] "If the oxidation mechanism is Mars–van Krevelen, the oxygen atom used to oxidize the substrate must be replaced by oxygen from the gas phase; if the oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface, it should be hard to put it back."

[6] "An example is alkane activation in which the breaking of the C–H bond results in binding of the H atom and the alkyl to two oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide."

[7] "Both mechanisms can be made more efficient by surface modifications that increase the chemical activity of the oxygen atoms in the surface."

[8] "If a surface modification makes the oxide a very strong oxidant (e.g., by making the energy of vacancy formation very small), this will not make it a good oxidation catalyst because the reaction will reduce the oxide and oxygen from the gas phase will not be efficient in reoxidizing it."

"If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

"The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as:
Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72)"

"As previously reported for ceria and rutile, doping of TiO2 anatase with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped TiO2."

"Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

"Doping with Fe decreases the Ef value in 1.5 eV, suggesting that the concentration of active vacancy defects might be much higher on the Fe-doped system."

"This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."
          
          "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This is the ability of ceria to store and release oxygen depending on the reaction conditions, i.e. under oxygen poor conditions, oxygen is released and under oxygen rich conditions, oxygen is taken up, leading to reoxidation of ceria."
          
          "For the example of CO oxidation, it is now understood that enhancing oxygen vacancy formation is important—if this formation energy can be made smaller, then the oxidative power of ceria will be improved"
          
          "We compute the formation energy of this oxygen vacancy from
          E (2O vac) = E (MCeO2−y) − {E (MCeO2−x) + 1/2E (O2)}, (2)"
          
          "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface."
          
          "For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."
          
          "For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to significant reductions in the formation energy of the active oxygen vacancy."

[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

          [2] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

          [3] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) - E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

          [4] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

[1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

          [2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

          [3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

          [4] "A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "In this mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."

          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4)."

          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[4] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

[5] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

[6] "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."

[1] "We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group)."

[2] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."

[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

[4] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

[5] "The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

[6] "If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst. We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface."

[1] "The origin of the different relativities to CO was attributed to the structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy [9]."

[2] "To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

[3] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[4] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

[5] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."

[6] "All oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12]) and suggests that formation of this oxygen vacancy will be enhanced over the undoped surface."

[1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant. A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr [3,4,11]."

[4] "The key finding is that upon doping of the (110) and (100) surfaces with Au, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is negative, indicating that if the system is in equilibrium, oxygen vacancies will be thermodynamically favourable."

[5] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

[6] "Since at sufficiently high temperature and an oxygen pressure of 1 atm almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them, it is the formation of a second oxygen vacancy that determines the oxidation activity of the doped surface."

[7] "The vacancy formation energies show that the dopant facilitates the formation of a second oxygen vacancy on (110) but not on (100), revealing a notable surface dependence that could be exploited in the design of nanostructured ceria catalysts."

"Consequently, oxygen vacancy defects can play a central role: surface lattice oxygen may act as an oxidant for adsorbates, thus creating oxygen vacancies (i.e., Mars–van Krevelen mechanism)"

          "We focus here on two fundamental aspects: (i) the energy required to form the oxygen defects and (ii) the electronic structure of the reduced systems"

          "To illustrate stability of these vacancies, we list in Table I the formation energy per vacancy (Ev^a)"

[1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy."

[2] "Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

[3] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."

[4] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, ΔEv, on Cu-, Zn-, Mg-, Fe-, or Al-doped La2O3 (001) and (011) surfaces. We found that these dopants cause a very substantial lowering of ΔEv from 6.44 eV for pure La2O3(001) to 0.52, 2.01, and 2.59 eV for La2O3(001) doped with Cu, Zn, or Mg, respectively."

[5] "Cu-doped lanthanum oxide is an example of this. The oxygen is so easy to remove that it is likely to be lost at a temperature lower than that of methane activation. This means that, under reaction conditions, the catalyst is reduced; our calculations show that the reduced CuLa2O3 does not break the CH bond efficiently."

"This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

"It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

"Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

"It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (226) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."

          "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."

          "Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller. However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

"Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

"When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface of rutile TiO2(110), to make an oxygen vacancy, two unpaired electrons are left in the oxide."

"The oxygen-vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as

Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]

where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

"The removal of a neutral oxygen atom leaves behind two electrons that had been engaged in two TiO bonds that were broken when the vacancy was formed."

"Forming the vacancy reduces the two 6c-Ti* atoms from a formal charge of 4+ to a formal charge of 3+."

[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[2] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[3] "We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of reactants and products."

[4] "Regardless of the initial oxidation state, the oxidation state of Pd cycles between either Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+ during the full reaction turnover of methane oxidation."

[5] "The consideration of product formation and vacancy filling sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water formation energies at the final step and neglected vacancy filling in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation over pure CeO2(1 1 1)."

[1] "For example, only recently has it been shown that the thermodynamic properties, not simply the reduction kinetics, of ceriazirconia solid solutions differ dramatically from those of pure ceria [17,18]."

[2] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

[3] "Oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

[4] "For bulk ceria, most oxidation occurs over a very narrow range of P(O2) in this temperature range because there are two ceria phases, a reduced phase and a more oxidized phase, in equilibrium at 973 K and below [42]."

[5] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

[6] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."

[7] "It is likely that high temperatures change the structure of the surface in such a way that the oxygen is more strongly bound and that factors other than surface versus bulk are involved in the catalytic properties of ceria."

[8] "It is also possible that factors other than oxygen binding energy are important for understanding the catalytic properties of ceria. Indeed, factors other than binding energy must be important. There are other oxides with multiple oxidation states and similar oxidation enthalpies that are not as active as ceria for oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[9] "In all of these applications, it is likely that the ability of cerium to cycle between Ce+3 and Ce+4 is crucial."

[10] "Since the reducibility of ceria is strongly affected by the presence of dopants and the structure of the material, much of the catalyst literature has focused on developing ways to tailor the properties of ceria."

[11] "Even with pure ceria, there is evidence that the redox properties of nano-crystallites used in catalysis are very different from the thermodynamic properties of the ceria that was used for the data tabulated in the handbooks."

"Here, the vacancy formation energy (Evac) is calculated by Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

          "On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb)."

          "It is clear that in heterogeneous catalysis the redox character at the surface is of essential importance."

          "A positive value for Evac means that energy is needed to create an oxygen vacancy."

          "The most critical role that ceria plays in three-way catalysts (TWCs) in automobiles [24] is to consume excess oxygen under fuel-lean conditions and to release oxygen under fuel-rich conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, that is to say, ceria has an oxygen storage capacity (OSC)."

No relevant quotes provided in the answer results.

[1] "It is widely accepted that the reactivity of TiO2(110), as that of many other oxide surfaces, is dominated by defect sites, particularly surface oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf), Evf=Etot(def)+1/2Etot(O2)-Etot(perf), where Etot(def), Etot(perf) are total energies for the defective and stoichiometric surfaces, respectively, and Etot(O2) is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "We find that no O2 adsorption takes place on the stoichiometric surface, whereas on the defective surface two preferential molecular and one dissociated adsorbed configurations are identified."

[4] "The first step of our study has been an accurate determination of the energy Evf to form a surface BO vacancy"

[5] "Using a bulk supercell of 96 95! atoms obtained eliminating the vacuum in the 232 supercell described above!, we obtained Evf,bulk;5.6 eV, a value close to those found for other oxides."

[6] "Evf;3.5 eV that we estimate for the surface BO vacancy agrees fairly well with recent line Density Functional Theory DFT! embedded cluster calculations."

[7] "Thus Evf;2/3Evf,bulk , consistent with simple coordination number arguments."

[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation is described by the reaction of Ce1xMxO2  Ce1xMxO2δ + 1/2O2."
          [2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."
          [3] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."
          [4] "The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without any activation energy leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Molecular O2 adsorbs at the O vacancy forming O adspecies that then drive CO oxidation and recover the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface."
          [5] "The reaction mechanisms for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration are depicted in Figure 7, consisting of three steps: (a) the oxidation of the first CO molecule on the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2(111) surface through participation of a lattice oxygen, leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption (Figure 7a); (b) the adsorption of molecular O2 at the O vacancy, leading to the formation of surface O adspecies (Figure 7b); and (c) the interaction of a CO molecule with these O adspecies, which drives CO oxidation and regeneration of the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 surface (Figure 7c)."
          [6] "The reduced catalysts can be sealed by an O2 molecule from the gas phase. The adsorption energy of the O2 molecule on the O vacancy is calculated to be 1.18 eV."

"A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

"The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

"The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface."

"We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

"Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide."

[1] "Oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are both reduction processes on ceria, specifically causing the reduction of surface metal atoms."

[2] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment."

[3] "We report the energies of oxygen vacancy formation for each surface, the preferred adsorption mode and sites for methane adsorption, and the dissociative methane adsorption energy."

[4] "Figure 7 shows the dissociative adsorption energy of methane plotted versus vacancy formation energy for each surface investigated."

[5] "The general trend between the energetics of vacancy formation and methane adsorption, however, suggests that the energy of methane adsorption on ceria surfaces is dependent on surface reducibility."

[6] "Dissociative methane adsorption proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical transition state in which a metal atom of the surface is reduced by a single electron. The activation barrier for this step, therefore, also correlates with the surface reducibility measured by the oxygen vacancy formation energy."

[1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2"

[2] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

[3] "Indeed, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[4] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[5] "Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox activity [13,14]."

[6] "Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly active and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation stream reforming of ethanol. The promotion effect was partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure ceria [20,21]."

"It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

"It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

"It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Mars–van Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."

[1] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[2] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeO(2-x)+x/2mO2(g)-mCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."

[3] "Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs."

[4] "Note that, as in the case of the formation energetics of the bulk oxides, the LDA+U value seems to be in better agreement with the experiments (4.7-5.0 eV from Table 1 in Ref. 23 and references therein) than the GGA+U result."

[1] "The positive role of oxygen vacancy defects on reduced oxide surfaces has been stressed."

[2] "In the case of CO oxidation by Au clusters supported on Fe-doped TiO2, the experiments provide clear indication that the main effect due to the presence of Fe is likely to facilitate O vacancy formation"

[3] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation (Ef) has been calculated as [...] All energies are obtained at the corresponding computational level, as described in Table 1. The calculated Ef values range between 4.5 and 5.3 eV"

[4] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase. However, the perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."

[5] "The present results provide compelling evidence that the presence of Fe strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface. This conclusion is likely to be much less dependent on the theoretical method used to describe the electronic structure of these materials"

[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas."

          [2] "As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

          [3] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it."

          [4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst."

[1] "Oxides are used as catalysts for many oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."

          [2] "ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."

[1] "Ceria can oxidise a molecule, by losing oxygen atoms with reduction of the surface. A reduced surface can promote reduction of a molecule through uptake of an oxygen atom from the molecule by the surface, see Fig. 1."

[2] "The importance of ceria in catalysis can be understood from its oxygen storage capability, OSC. This refers to the fact that ceria can oxidise or reduce molecules, depending on the conditions in the reactor stream."

[3] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."

[4] "We observe an interesting result that the vacancy formation energies do not follow the same order as the stabilities of the pure surfaces, as measured by the surface energy; thus, the (110) surface has the lowest vacancy formation energy."

[5] "It is generally taken to be the case that less stable surfaces will be more favourable for the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus more catalytically active."

[6] "For the calculation of the surface vacancy formation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems which contain Ce—these species need to be described by a consistent approach—and GGA-DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are correctly described by GGA-DFT."

[1] "We assume that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "The formation and the annihilation of the oxygen vacancies are critical steps in this Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and this suggests that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv) might be a good descriptor of the catalytic properties of doped oxides."

[3] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[4] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv. These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."

[5] "Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve."

[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis. However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be oxidised to CO2."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT. This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation energies are thus an underestimation."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

[5] "Knowledge of the mechanism of these reactions, their energetics and any surface sensitivity would be of great help in developing and optimising new ceria-containing catalysts."

[1] "Ceria is one of the most interesting oxides industrially because it can readily create oxygen vacancies and whereby Ce4+ ions are reduced to Ce3+. This property gives ceria its high oxygen storage capacity as well as its catalytic properties;"

[2] "Knowing the local structure, clustering properties and mobility of the oxygen vacancies on surfaces of ceria is of paramount importance for understanding their catalytic roles, both in the context of supported noble metals and in relation to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria."

[3] "Daturi et al. [10] found that the deNOx activity (i.e. the ability to remove nitrogen oxides, NOx, namely NO2, NO, N2O) of oxide-based catalysts such as ceria can be correlated to the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies present at the surface."

[4] "Daturi et al. [10] proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on CeO2 surfaces, where the two oxygen atoms of two NO molecules fill two neighboring oxygen vacancies, thus acting as reoxidizing agents on the prereduced surface, while the nitrogen atoms combine to give rise to a N2 molecule."

[5] "The formation energy (ΔEv) for a single surface oxygen vacancy calculated using Eq. (2) is 2.10 eV"

[1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

          [2] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

          [3] "In the case of CeO2 nanorods, the more reactive planes are exposed. Moreover, the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates the reactive planes can be well protected. Thus a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate better catalytic performance during reaction."

"The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

          "Upon reduction of ceria, CeIV ions are formally reduced to CeIII, Eq. (1), and it is expected that these ions will be localised around the oxygen vacancy sites."

          "For the present study, we consider the electronic structure of the partially reduced (100) surface. To enable investigation of the oxygen vacancy a 2 × 2 expansion of the pure (100) surface was created with two vacancies, one on each of the surfaces, thus ensuring that the slab has no net dipole moment, Fig. 5."

          "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."

"We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

"In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."

"We find that the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."

"To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase, costs 3.00 eV. [...] For the Pt-doped ceria, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV."

"It is suspected that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

[1] "The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of CeO, is partially reduced by CO."

[2] "It is assumed that CO reacts directly with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form bidentate carbonate species, and then the bidentate carbonate species as an intermediate are converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species"

[3] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively"

[4] "CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et aZ.20*2r Their results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain CO oxidation on CeO,."

[5] "The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, but the more important reason for CO oxidation at room temperature should be the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO to be oxidized easily."

"An essential step in the Mars–van Krevelen oxidation mechanism is the reaction of a surface oxygen atom with a gas-phase reducing agent, to form an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."

"We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide. Thus, we can measure the oxidizing capacity of an oxide by calculating the energy needed to form a vacancy."

"However, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a measure of catalytic activity, because a second important step is the ability to heal the vacancy formed by the oxidation process by adsorbing and activating oxygen from the gas phase."

"We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive. In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there. One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxygen vacancy in the surface."

[1] "Formation of surface oxygen vacancies is easily achieved through ion bombardment or controlled thermal annealing and quenching. The ease with which oxygen vacancies can be formed is thought to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2, since this creates reactive sites into which molecules can adsorb."

[2] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."

[3] "Since O-deficient surfaces possess an electron excess, these defect states constitute frontier orbitals, and are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules."

[4] "TiO2 has potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis, (3-5) gas sensor devices, (6) and photocatalysis, (7-10) where surface defects are active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of molecules."

[5] "Surface energies increase as Esurf(110) < Esurf(100) < Esurf(101) < Esurf(001), while vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101), demonstrating only weak correlation between surface stability and oxygen lability."

[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En=ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[2] "A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."

[3] "For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively."

[4] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

[5] "For the reduced surfaces, the Ce 4f states are partially occupied. The conductivity and chemical properties are expected to be modified by the creation of O vacancies."

[6] "These defective surfaces with significant changes in surface structure are expected to be more active towards foreign incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces."

[7] "Our surface En values in Table II are all lower than our bulk value. This is in agreement with earlier empirical interaction model calculations, which suggested that a vacancy defect is more stable at the surface than within the bulk."

[1] "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide's surface."

[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

[3] "If the oxidation reaction uses oxygen from the surface, the oxidation creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. However, because oxygen is present in the gas, the vacancies will be filled by a competing process."

[4] "A good dopant should activate the surface oxygen but not by too much."

[5] "If the oxidation mechanism is Mars–van Krevelen, the oxygen atom used to oxidize the substrate must be replaced by oxygen from the gas phase; if the oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface, it should be hard to put it back."

[6] "An example is alkane activation in which the breaking of the C–H bond results in binding of the H atom and the alkyl to two oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide."

[7] "Both mechanisms can be made more efficient by surface modifications that increase the chemical activity of the oxygen atoms in the surface."

[8] "If a surface modification makes the oxide a very strong oxidant (e.g., by making the energy of vacancy formation very small), this will not make it a good oxidation catalyst because the reaction will reduce the oxide and oxygen from the gas phase will not be efficient in reoxidizing it."

"If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

"The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as:
Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72)"

"As previously reported for ceria and rutile, doping of TiO2 anatase with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped TiO2."

"Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

"Doping with Fe decreases the Ef value in 1.5 eV, suggesting that the concentration of active vacancy defects might be much higher on the Fe-doped system."

"This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."
          
          "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This is the ability of ceria to store and release oxygen depending on the reaction conditions, i.e. under oxygen poor conditions, oxygen is released and under oxygen rich conditions, oxygen is taken up, leading to reoxidation of ceria."
          
          "For the example of CO oxidation, it is now understood that enhancing oxygen vacancy formation is important—if this formation energy can be made smaller, then the oxidative power of ceria will be improved"
          
          "We compute the formation energy of this oxygen vacancy from
          E (2O vac) = E (MCeO2−y) − {E (MCeO2−x) + 1/2E (O2)}, (2)"
          
          "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface."
          
          "For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."
          
          "For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to significant reductions in the formation energy of the active oxygen vacancy."

[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

          [2] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

          [3] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) - E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

          [4] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

[1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

          [2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

          [3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

          [4] "A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy."

[1] "In this mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."

          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4)."

          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

[1] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."

[2] "To determine to what extent the oxide becomes a better oxidant when doped with Au, we have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "While CO adsorption and CO2 desorption produce the desired product, this reactions is not catalytic because it removes irreversibly oxygen from the surface. To have a catalyst we must find how gas-phase oxygen fills the oxygen vacancies formed by CO2 desorption."

[4] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV). This complex decomposes to release CO2 and leaves behind an oxygen atom that fills the vacancy. This restores the surface to its initial state, which means that this set of reactions is catalytic."

[5] "Doping weakens dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide, even when a Ti atom is substituted by Au in the slab sub layer (not shown)."

[6] "Our results suggest that the Au-doped TiO2 is a stronger oxidant than the pure oxide or the one with a neutral Au cluster on it."

[1] "We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group)."

[2] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."

[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

[4] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

[5] "The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

[6] "If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst. We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface."

[1] "The origin of the different relativities to CO was attributed to the structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy [9]."

[2] "To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

[3] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[4] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

[5] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."

[6] "All oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12]) and suggests that formation of this oxygen vacancy will be enhanced over the undoped surface."

[1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant. A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr [3,4,11]."

[4] "The key finding is that upon doping of the (110) and (100) surfaces with Au, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is negative, indicating that if the system is in equilibrium, oxygen vacancies will be thermodynamically favourable."

[5] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

[6] "Since at sufficiently high temperature and an oxygen pressure of 1 atm almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them, it is the formation of a second oxygen vacancy that determines the oxidation activity of the doped surface."

[7] "The vacancy formation energies show that the dopant facilitates the formation of a second oxygen vacancy on (110) but not on (100), revealing a notable surface dependence that could be exploited in the design of nanostructured ceria catalysts."

"Consequently, oxygen vacancy defects can play a central role: surface lattice oxygen may act as an oxidant for adsorbates, thus creating oxygen vacancies (i.e., Mars–van Krevelen mechanism)"

          "We focus here on two fundamental aspects: (i) the energy required to form the oxygen defects and (ii) the electronic structure of the reduced systems"

          "To illustrate stability of these vacancies, we list in Table I the formation energy per vacancy (Ev^a)"

[1] "If a doped oxide is used as an oxidation catalyst by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, then one should seek a dopant that makes it easy to make oxygen vacancies, but not too easy."

[2] "Informally, we call this a moderation principle. The point is that, if the oxygen is very easy to remove, then it is a very good oxidant, but not a good oxidation catalyst, since it is difficult to put the oxygen back."

[3] "We find that the ease with which one can make oxygen vacancies correlates with the reactivity of the surface toward methane dissociation."

[4] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, ΔEv, on Cu-, Zn-, Mg-, Fe-, or Al-doped La2O3 (001) and (011) surfaces. We found that these dopants cause a very substantial lowering of ΔEv from 6.44 eV for pure La2O3(001) to 0.52, 2.01, and 2.59 eV for La2O3(001) doped with Cu, Zn, or Mg, respectively."

[5] "Cu-doped lanthanum oxide is an example of this. The oxygen is so easy to remove that it is likely to be lost at a temperature lower than that of methane activation. This means that, under reaction conditions, the catalyst is reduced; our calculations show that the reduced CuLa2O3 does not break the CH bond efficiently."

"This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

"It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

"Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

"It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (226) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."

          "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."

          "Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller. However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

"Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

"When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface of rutile TiO2(110), to make an oxygen vacancy, two unpaired electrons are left in the oxide."

"The oxygen-vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as

Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]

where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

"The removal of a neutral oxygen atom leaves behind two electrons that had been engaged in two TiO bonds that were broken when the vacancy was formed."

"Forming the vacancy reduces the two 6c-Ti* atoms from a formal charge of 4+ to a formal charge of 3+."

[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[2] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[3] "We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of reactants and products."

[4] "Regardless of the initial oxidation state, the oxidation state of Pd cycles between either Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+ during the full reaction turnover of methane oxidation."

[5] "The consideration of product formation and vacancy filling sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water formation energies at the final step and neglected vacancy filling in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation over pure CeO2(1 1 1)."

[1] "For example, only recently has it been shown that the thermodynamic properties, not simply the reduction kinetics, of ceriazirconia solid solutions differ dramatically from those of pure ceria [17,18]."

[2] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

[3] "Oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

[4] "For bulk ceria, most oxidation occurs over a very narrow range of P(O2) in this temperature range because there are two ceria phases, a reduced phase and a more oxidized phase, in equilibrium at 973 K and below [42]."

[5] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

[6] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."

[7] "It is likely that high temperatures change the structure of the surface in such a way that the oxygen is more strongly bound and that factors other than surface versus bulk are involved in the catalytic properties of ceria."

[8] "It is also possible that factors other than oxygen binding energy are important for understanding the catalytic properties of ceria. Indeed, factors other than binding energy must be important. There are other oxides with multiple oxidation states and similar oxidation enthalpies that are not as active as ceria for oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[9] "In all of these applications, it is likely that the ability of cerium to cycle between Ce+3 and Ce+4 is crucial."

[10] "Since the reducibility of ceria is strongly affected by the presence of dopants and the structure of the material, much of the catalyst literature has focused on developing ways to tailor the properties of ceria."

[11] "Even with pure ceria, there is evidence that the redox properties of nano-crystallites used in catalysis are very different from the thermodynamic properties of the ceria that was used for the data tabulated in the handbooks."

"Here, the vacancy formation energy (Evac) is calculated by Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

          "On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb)."

          "It is clear that in heterogeneous catalysis the redox character at the surface is of essential importance."

          "A positive value for Evac means that energy is needed to create an oxygen vacancy."

          "The most critical role that ceria plays in three-way catalysts (TWCs) in automobiles [24] is to consume excess oxygen under fuel-lean conditions and to release oxygen under fuel-rich conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, that is to say, ceria has an oxygen storage capacity (OSC)."

No relevant quotes provided in the answer results.

[1] "It is widely accepted that the reactivity of TiO2(110), as that of many other oxide surfaces, is dominated by defect sites, particularly surface oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf), Evf=Etot(def)+1/2Etot(O2)-Etot(perf), where Etot(def), Etot(perf) are total energies for the defective and stoichiometric surfaces, respectively, and Etot(O2) is the energy of an O2 molecule in the gas phase."

[3] "We find that no O2 adsorption takes place on the stoichiometric surface, whereas on the defective surface two preferential molecular and one dissociated adsorbed configurations are identified."

[4] "The first step of our study has been an accurate determination of the energy Evf to form a surface BO vacancy"

[5] "Using a bulk supercell of 96 95! atoms obtained eliminating the vacuum in the 232 supercell described above!, we obtained Evf,bulk;5.6 eV, a value close to those found for other oxides."

[6] "Evf;3.5 eV that we estimate for the surface BO vacancy agrees fairly well with recent line Density Functional Theory DFT! embedded cluster calculations."

[7] "Thus Evf;2/3Evf,bulk , consistent with simple coordination number arguments."

[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation is described by the reaction of Ce1xMxO2  Ce1xMxO2δ + 1/2O2."
          [2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."
          [3] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."
          [4] "The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without any activation energy leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Molecular O2 adsorbs at the O vacancy forming O adspecies that then drive CO oxidation and recover the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface."
          [5] "The reaction mechanisms for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration are depicted in Figure 7, consisting of three steps: (a) the oxidation of the first CO molecule on the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2(111) surface through participation of a lattice oxygen, leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption (Figure 7a); (b) the adsorption of molecular O2 at the O vacancy, leading to the formation of surface O adspecies (Figure 7b); and (c) the interaction of a CO molecule with these O adspecies, which drives CO oxidation and regeneration of the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 surface (Figure 7c)."
          [6] "The reduced catalysts can be sealed by an O2 molecule from the gas phase. The adsorption energy of the O2 molecule on the O vacancy is calculated to be 1.18 eV."
