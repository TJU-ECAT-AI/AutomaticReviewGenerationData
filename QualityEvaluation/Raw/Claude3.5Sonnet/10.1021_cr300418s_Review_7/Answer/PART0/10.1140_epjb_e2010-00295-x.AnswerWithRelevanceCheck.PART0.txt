          [1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2"

[2] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

[3] "Indeed, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[4] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[5] "Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox activity [13,14]."

[6] "Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly active and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation stream reforming of ethanol. The promotion effect was partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure ceria [20,21]."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through the following steps:

1. The reactant molecule (e.g., CO) adsorbs on the metal catalyst surface.
2. The adsorbed molecule reacts with lattice oxygen from the oxide support (e.g., ceria) at the metal-support interface, forming the product (e.g., CO2).
3. This process creates an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface.
4. The reduced oxide support is then re-oxidized by another oxidant (e.g., H2O, O2), regenerating the catalyst and completing the cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Reducibility indicator: ΔEv serves as an important probe of the oxide's reducibility. Lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more easily reducible.

2. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a more reducible oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions, facilitating the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

3. Oxygen mobility: Lower ΔEv values are often associated with higher oxygen mobility within the oxide, which is important for replenishing surface oxygen vacancies and maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv is directly related to the strength of the metal-oxygen bond in the oxide. Lower ΔEv implies weaker metal-oxygen bonds, resulting in a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

5. Catalyst design: Understanding the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic performance helps in rational catalyst design. For example, doping ceria with certain elements can lower the ΔEv, enhancing its catalytic properties.

6. Redox properties: ΔEv is a key descriptor of the oxide's redox properties, providing insight into its ability to participate in redox reactions, which is fundamental to many catalytic processes.

7. Stability considerations: While lower ΔEv generally indicates higher activity, extremely low values could lead to over-reduction, potentially causing structural instability or loss of active sites.

In summary, ΔEv plays a crucial role in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by influencing the ease of oxygen release, catalyst regeneration, and overall catalytic performance. It serves as a valuable guide in understanding and improving oxide catalysts for various oxidation reactions.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理通过以下步骤运作：

1. 反应物分子（如CO）吸附在金属催化剂表面。
2. 吸附的分子在金属-支撑体界面与氧化物支撑体（如氧化铈）的晶格氧反应，形成产物（如CO2）。
3. 这个过程在氧化物表面创造了一个氧空位。
4. 还原的氧化物支撑体随后被另一种氧化剂（如H2O、O2）重新氧化，再生催化剂并完成循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义：

1. 可还原性指标：ΔEv作为氧化物可还原性的重要探针。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更容易被还原。

2. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为更易还原的氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，促进Mars-van Krevelen机理的进行。

3. 氧移动性：较低的ΔEv值通常与氧化物内部更高的氧移动性相关，这对于补充表面氧空位和维持催化剂活性很重要。

4. 氧化能力：ΔEv直接与氧化物中金属-氧键的强度相关。较低的ΔEv意味着金属-氧键较弱，导致氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力。

5. 催化剂设计：理解ΔEv与催化性能之间的关系有助于理性设计催化剂。例如，用某些元素掺杂氧化铈可以降低ΔEv，增强其催化性能。

6. 氧化还原性质：ΔEv是氧化物氧化还原性质的关键描述符，提供了其参与氧化还原反应能力的洞察，这对许多催化过程至关重要。

7. 稳定性考虑：虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的活性，但极低的值可能导致过度还原，可能造成结构不稳定或活性位点的丧失。

总之，ΔEv通过影响氧释放的容易程度、催化剂再生和整体催化性能在Mars-van Krevelen机理中扮演着至关重要的角色。它作为理解和改进各种氧化反应的氧化物催化剂的有价值指南。
