          "Here, the vacancy formation energy (Evac) is calculated by Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

          "On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb)."

          "It is clear that in heterogeneous catalysis the redox character at the surface is of essential importance."

          "A positive value for Evac means that energy is needed to create an oxygen vacancy."

          "The most critical role that ceria plays in three-way catalysts (TWCs) in automobiles [24] is to consume excess oxygen under fuel-lean conditions and to release oxygen under fuel-rich conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, that is to say, ceria has an oxygen storage capacity (OSC)."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen from the catalyst surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

          A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the catalyst surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because more easily removable oxygen is more reactive and can more readily participate in oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, it might lead to over-reduction of the catalyst, potentially degrading its performance.

          The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A moderate ΔEv ensures that the oxide can release oxygen to oxidize reactants but also allows for the re-oxidation of the reduced catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle.

          In the context of the study, Zr doping of ceria was found to lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy at the surface by about 20% (0.52 eV) when the vacancy is created next to a Zr ion. This reduction in ΔEv suggests that Zr doping enhances the catalytic activity of the ceria surface by making lattice oxygen more readily available for oxidation reactions, while still maintaining sufficient stability of the oxide structure.

          The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as a descriptor for catalyst performance. By tuning ΔEv through strategies like doping (as demonstrated with Zr in ceria), researchers can optimize oxide catalysts for specific oxidation reactions, balancing activity and oxidizing ability.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及从催化剂表面移除晶格氧以氧化反应物，随后通过气相氧补充氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

          较低的ΔEv表明从催化剂表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为更容易移除的氧更具反应性，可以更容易地参与氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致催化剂过度还原，潜在地降低其性能。

          氧化物表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。适度的ΔEv确保氧化物可以释放氧来氧化反应物，但也允许还原后的催化剂重新氧化，完成催化循环。

          在这项研究中，发现当在Zr离子附近创建空位时，Zr掺杂的氧化铈在表面的氧空位形成能降低了约20%（0.52 eV）。ΔEv的这种降低表明，Zr掺杂通过使晶格氧更容易用于氧化反应来增强氧化铈表面的催化活性，同时仍然保持氧化物结构的足够稳定性。

          ΔEv的重要性在于它作为催化剂性能描述符的作用。通过诸如掺杂（如在氧化铈中使用Zr所示）等策略调整ΔEv，研究人员可以针对特定的氧化反应优化氧化物催化剂，平衡活性和氧化能力。
