          [1] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[2] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeO(2-x)+x/2mO2(g)-mCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."

[3] "Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs."

[4] "Note that, as in the case of the formation energetics of the bulk oxides, the LDA+U value seems to be in better agreement with the experiments (4.7-5.0 eV from Table 1 in Ref. 23 and references therein) than the GGA+U result."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide catalysis.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv), referred to as the "heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy" in the text, is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.
2. Lower vacancy formation energy generally correlates with higher catalytic activity, as it makes it easier for the catalyst to participate in redox cycles.
3. The vacancy formation energy influences the oxide's ability to release and reincorporate oxygen, which is crucial for its oxidizing ability.

The literature reports calculated values for this energy in ceria: 5.05 eV using LDA+U method and 2.01 eV using GGA+U method. The LDA+U value (5.05 eV) is noted to be in better agreement with experimental values (4.7-5.0 eV).

Ceria-based materials act as oxygen reservoirs in catalytic reactions by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at reaction sites. This is achieved through the formation and filling of oxygen vacancies, which are closely linked to the ability of cerium to switch between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states.

While the text doesn't directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the information about oxygen vacancies and the energetics of their formation in ceria provides insight into why this material is an effective catalyst for oxidation reactions. The ability to control and predict this energy is crucial for designing effective ceria-based catalysts for various applications, such as hydrogen production and air pollution reduction.

          虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本提供了一些关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这对于氧化物催化中的Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。

文中将氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)称为"每个氧空位的还原热"。这个能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要，原因如下：

1. 它代表了从氧化物晶格中移除一个氧原子所需的能量成本，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的关键步骤。
2. 较低的空位形成能通常与更高的催化活性相关，因为它使催化剂更容易参与氧化还原循环。
3. 空位形成能影响氧化物释放和重新结合氧的能力，这对其氧化能力至关重要。

文献报道了氧化铈中这种能量的计算值：使用LDA+U方法为5.05 eV，使用GGA+U方法为2.01 eV。文中指出，LDA+U值(5.05 eV)与实验值(4.7-5.0 eV)更为接近。

基于铈的材料通过控制反应位点的氧分压来充当催化反应中的氧储存库。这是通过形成和填充氧空位实现的，而氧空位与铈在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间切换的能力密切相关。

虽然文本没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但关于氧化铈中氧空位及其形成能量学的信息为理解这种材料作为氧化反应有效催化剂的原因提供了洞见。控制和预测这种能量对于设计各种应用的有效基于铈的催化剂至关重要，例如氢气生产和空气污染减少。
