          "Consequently, oxygen vacancy defects can play a central role: surface lattice oxygen may act as an oxidant for adsorbates, thus creating oxygen vacancies (i.e., Mars–van Krevelen mechanism)"

          "We focus here on two fundamental aspects: (i) the energy required to form the oxygen defects and (ii) the electronic structure of the reduced systems"

          "To illustrate stability of these vacancies, we list in Table I the formation energy per vacancy (Ev^a)"

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using surface lattice oxygen as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, which can enhance catalytic activity as these vacancies often serve as active sites. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may reduce the oxidizing power of the surface or make the oxide unstable. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger oxygen binding, which can increase the oxidizing ability of the surface but may limit vacancy formation and thus catalytic activity. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is crucial for balancing catalytic activity and oxidizing ability in oxide catalysts. Understanding the nature of oxygen vacancies, including their formation energies, is crucial for elucidating the roles of oxides like ceria in various catalytic applications.

          Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过使用表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂来操作，这在氧化物表面创造了氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧空位可以更容易形成，这可以通过提供更多活性位点来增强催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会降低表面的氧化能力或使氧化物不稳定。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧与表面结合更强，这可以增加氧化能力，但可能会限制空位形成，从而限制催化活性。因此，最佳的ΔEv值对于平衡氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。理解氧空位的性质，包括它们的形成能量，对于阐明像氧化铈这样的氧化物在各种催化应用中的作用至关重要。
