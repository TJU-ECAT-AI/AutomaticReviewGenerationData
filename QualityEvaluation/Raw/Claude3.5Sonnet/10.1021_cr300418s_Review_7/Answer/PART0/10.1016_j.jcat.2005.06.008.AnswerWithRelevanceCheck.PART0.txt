          "It is generally accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions occurs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mechanism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxidation of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen vacancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen."

"It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."

"It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Mars–van Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cyclic process of surface reduction and oxidation. For CO oxidation on ceria, this involves:

1. CO reacting with surface oxygen, reducing the ceria surface and forming an oxygen vacancy
2. The oxygen vacancy being replenished by gas-phase oxygen, re-oxidizing the surface
3. Formation and desorption of CO2, completing the cycle

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. Lower ΔEv makes it easier to form oxygen vacancies, increasing reactivity
2. Different crystal planes have different ΔEv values, with {110} and {100} planes having lower ΔEv than {111} planes
3. Surfaces with lower ΔEv (e.g. {110} and {100}) are more reactive for CO oxidation
4. The relative stability and ΔEv of different surface planes follows the order: {111} > {110} > {100}

Thus, the exposure of more reactive planes with lower ΔEv values (like {100}) can enhance the catalytic activity of ceria for CO oxidation by facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and the overall redox cycle. The significance of ΔEv is that it directly influences which surfaces are most catalytically active, with lower ΔEv corresponding to higher activity but lower stability.

          Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过表面还原和氧化的循环过程运作。对于二氧化铈上的CO氧化，这涉及：

1. CO与表面氧反应，还原二氧化铈表面并形成氧空位
2. 气相氧补充氧空位，重新氧化表面
3. CO2形成并脱附，完成循环

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为：

1. 较低的ΔEv使氧空位更容易形成，从而提高反应活性
2. 不同的晶面具有不同的ΔEv值，其中{110}和{100}面的ΔEv低于{111}面
3. ΔEv较低的表面（如{110}和{100}）对CO氧化的反应性更强
4. 不同表面平面的相对稳定性和ΔEv遵循以下顺序：{111} > {110} > {100}

因此，暴露ΔEv值较低的更具反应性的平面（如{100}）可以通过促进氧空位的形成和整个氧化还原循环，增强二氧化铈对CO氧化的催化活性。ΔEv的重要性在于它直接影响哪些表面最具催化活性，较低的ΔEv对应于较高的活性但较低的稳定性。
