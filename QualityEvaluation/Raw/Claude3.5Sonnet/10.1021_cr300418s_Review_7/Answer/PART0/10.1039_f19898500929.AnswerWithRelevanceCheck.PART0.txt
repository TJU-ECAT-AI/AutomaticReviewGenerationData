          [1] "The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of CeO, is partially reduced by CO."

[2] "It is assumed that CO reacts directly with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form bidentate carbonate species, and then the bidentate carbonate species as an intermediate are converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species"

[3] "From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 two peaks at 770 and 1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen ions, respectively"

[4] "CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et aZ.20*2r Their results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain CO oxidation on CeO,."

[5] "The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, but the more important reason for CO oxidation at room temperature should be the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO to be oxidized easily."

          While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the literature, the text describes a similar process for CO oxidation on CeO2 surfaces. This mechanism involves CO reacting with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form carbonate species, indicating partial reduction of the CeO2 surface. A cyclic reduction/oxidation mechanism involving lattice oxide ions is proposed for CO oxidation above 473 K, which is similar to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not directly mentioned. However, the literature suggests that surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are more easily reduced than bulk lattice oxygen ions. This is evidenced by temperature-programmed reaction studies showing reduction peaks at 770 K for surface-capping oxygen ions and 1020 K for bulk oxygen ions. This difference in reducibility implies varying energy barriers for oxygen removal, which affects the catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is related to the ease of oxygen removal. Surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are more readily available for oxidation reactions compared to bulk lattice oxygen. This suggests that the surface's oxidizing ability is influenced by the type and location of oxygen species present.

The catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface are influenced by both the availability of reactive oxygen species and the presence of surface-active sites. While surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming carbonate and carboxylate species, the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO is considered more important for CO oxidation at room temperature. This indicates that both the ease of oxygen removal (related to ΔEv) and the surface structure play crucial roles in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

          虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本描述了CeO2表面上CO氧化的类似过程。这个机制涉及CO与表面氧物种和顶层氧离子反应形成碳酸盐物种，表明CeO2表面被部分还原。对于473 K以上的CO氧化，提出了一个涉及晶格氧离子的循环还原/氧化机制，这与Mars-van Krevelen机制类似。

文献中没有直接提到氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，文献表明表面氧物种和顶层氧离子比体相晶格氧离子更容易被还原。这从温度程序反应研究中得到证实，显示表面顶层氧离子在770 K处有还原峰，而体相氧离子在1020 K处有还原峰。这种还原性的差异意味着氧移除的能量障碍不同，这影响了催化活性。

氧化物表面的氧化能力与氧的易移除性有关。与体相晶格氧相比，表面氧物种和顶层氧离子更容易参与氧化反应。这表明表面的氧化能力受到存在的氧物种类型和位置的影响。

氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力受到活性氧物种的可用性和表面活性位点存在的影响。虽然表面氧物种和顶层氧离子对形成碳酸盐和羧酸盐物种是必要的，但对于室温下的CO氧化，能够活化CO的表面活性位点的存在被认为更为重要。这表明，氧的易移除性（与ΔEv相关）和表面结构都在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
