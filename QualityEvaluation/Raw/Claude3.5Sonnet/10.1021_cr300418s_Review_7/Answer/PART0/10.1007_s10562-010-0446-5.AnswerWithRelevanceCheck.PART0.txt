          [1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

          [2] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

          [3] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) - E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

          [4] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This process creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide lattice.

          The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which in turn increases the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms. This enhanced oxygen mobility leads to higher catalytic activity.

          The significance of Evac is demonstrated in the comparison between undoped CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2. The Evac for undoped CeO2 (111) is 2.87 eV, while for Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) it is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV. This reduction in Evac explains why Zr-doped ceria shows improved catalytic performance compared to pure ceria.

          The lower Evac in Zr-doped ceria leads to:
          1. Increased mobility of lattice oxygen atoms
          2. More efficient attraction of CO molecules from the gas phase
          3. Enhanced overall oxidation process
          4. Higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface

          Additionally, Zr doping facilitates the CO oxidation process due to:
          1. The smaller size of Zr4+ compared to Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+
          2. Smaller reduction energy
          3. Higher oxygen mobility compared to pure ceria

          In summary, a lower Evac generally correlates with higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface in the context of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This parameter helps in understanding and predicting the relative activities of different oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。这个过程在氧化物晶格中创造了一个氧空位。

          氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的Evac表明更容易创造氧空位，这反过来又增加了晶格氧原子的移动性。这种增强的氧移动性导致更高的催化活性。

          Evac的重要性在未掺杂CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2的比较中得到了证明。未掺杂CeO2(111)的Evac为2.87 eV，而Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)的Evac降低了约20%至2.35 eV。这种Evac的降低解释了为什么Zr掺杂的氧化铈比纯氧化铈表现出更好的催化性能。

          Zr掺杂氧化铈中较低的Evac导致：
          1. 晶格氧原子的移动性增加
          2. 更有效地吸引气相中的CO分子
          3. 增强整体氧化过程
          4. 表面具有更高的催化活性和氧化能力

          此外，Zr掺杂促进CO氧化过程是由于：
          1. Zr4+比Ce4+尺寸更小，这为Ce3+的形成释放了应力
          2. 较小的还原能
          3. 与纯氧化铈相比，具有更高的氧移动性

          总之，在Mars-van Krevelen机制的背景下，较低的Evac通常与氧化物表面更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关。这个参数有助于理解和预测不同氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的相对活性。
