          [1] "The origin of the different relativities to CO was attributed to the structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy [9]."

[2] "To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

[3] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[4] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

[5] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."

[6] "All oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12]) and suggests that formation of this oxygen vacancy will be enhanced over the undoped surface."

          While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, the text provides significant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is crucial for understanding oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct relationship to the reactivity of the oxide surface. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy generally leads to enhanced reactivity and catalytic activity.

For ceria:
1. It has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy due to the ease with which cerium can change its oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+.
2. Different surfaces of ceria have different oxygen vacancy formation energies, increasing in the order (110) < (100) < (111).
3. The (110) surface has the lowest energy (1.18 eV) and thus is more reactive than the (111) surface (2.60 eV for undoped).

Doping ceria with other elements, such as lanthanum, can further reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy:
1. For La-doped ceria, the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is reduced to 0.90 eV on the (111) surface and 0.64 eV on the (110) surface.
2. This reduction in vacancy formation energy is expected to enhance the catalytic activity of the material.

Although there's still an energy cost to form oxygen vacancies, the lower ΔEv in doped ceria suggests that vacancy formation will be enhanced compared to the undoped surface. This easier formation of oxygen vacancies implies a higher oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more readily release oxygen for reactions.

In summary, while the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly addressed, the literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy in determining the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces. Lower ΔEv values generally correspond to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability, making materials like ceria and its doped variants particularly interesting for catalytic applications.

          虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的重要信息，这对理解氧化物催化的氧化反应至关重要。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物表面反应活性直接相关。较低的氧空位形成能通常会导致更高的反应性和催化活性。

对于氧化铈：
1. 它具有相对较小的氧空位形成能，这归因于铈易于从Ce4+变为Ce3+的氧化态。
2. 氧化铈的不同表面具有不同的氧空位形成能，按(110) < (100) < (111)的顺序增加。
3. (110)表面具有最低的能量（1.18 eV），因此比(111)表面（未掺杂时为2.60 eV）更具反应性。

用其他元素（如镧）掺杂氧化铈可以进一步降低氧空位形成能：
1. 对于镧掺杂的氧化铈，在(111)表面形成氧空位所需的能量降低到0.90 eV，在(110)表面降低到0.64 eV。
2. 这种空位形成能的降低预计将增强材料的催化活性。

虽然形成氧空位仍然需要能量成本，但掺杂氧化铈中较低的ΔEv表明，与未掺杂表面相比，空位形成将得到增强。这种更容易形成氧空位的特性意味着表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。

总之，虽然没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文献强调了氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面催化性质中的重要性。较低的ΔEv值通常对应于更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，使得氧化铈及其掺杂变体在催化应用中特别有趣。
