          [1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[2] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[3] "We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of reactants and products."

[4] "Regardless of the initial oxidation state, the oxidation state of Pd cycles between either Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+ during the full reaction turnover of methane oxidation."

[5] "The consideration of product formation and vacancy filling sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water formation energies at the final step and neglected vacancy filling in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation over pure CeO2(1 1 1)."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen reacts with adsorbed species to form products (such as water), creating oxygen vacancies on the surface. These vacancies are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or bulk oxygen diffusion, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the participation of lattice oxygen in the reaction. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to CeO2(1 1 1), correlating with its lower methane activation barrier and thus higher activity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A surface with lower ΔEv can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially leading to higher oxidation rates. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may result in over-oxidation of reactants or products, potentially reducing selectivity.

The significance of ΔEv extends to the overall reaction mechanism, including product formation and vacancy refilling steps. These steps are crucial for completing the catalytic cycle and maintaining the catalyst's activity over time. The sequential consideration of these steps throughout the reaction mechanism, as opposed to treating them as final steps, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the oxidation process and the role of oxygen vacancies in catalysis.

In the context of methane oxidation, the cycling of Pd oxidation states (between Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+) during the reaction turnover illustrates the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface and the importance of redox processes in the overall mechanism. This cycling, coupled with the formation and filling of oxygen vacancies, highlights the complexity of the catalytic process and the critical role of the oxide surface in facilitating the reaction.

The overall catalytic performance is influenced by the balance between vacancy formation and refilling rates, which depend on reaction conditions such as temperature and partial pressures of reactants and products. Understanding these relationships allows for the design of more effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及催化剂表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机理中，表面氧与吸附物种反应形成产物（如水），在表面上创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相氧或体相氧扩散所填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它促进了晶格氧参与反应。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，与其较低的甲烷活化能垒相关，因此具有更高的活性。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，可能导致更高的氧化速率。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致反应物或产物的过度氧化，可能降低选择性。

ΔEv的重要性还延伸到整个反应机制，包括产物形成和空位填充步骤。这些步骤对于完成催化循环和维持催化剂的长期活性至关重要。在整个反应机制中sequential考虑这些步骤，而不是将它们作为最后步骤处理，可以更全面地理解氧化过程和氧空位在催化中的作用。

在甲烷氧化的背景下，Pd氧化态在反应周转过程中的循环（在Pd0/Pd2+或Pd2+/Pd4+之间）说明了催化剂表面的动态性质以及氧化还原过程在整个机理中的重要性。这种循环，加上氧空位的形成和填充，突出了催化过程的复杂性以及氧化物表面在促进反应中的关键作用。

整体催化性能受空位形成和填充速率平衡的影响，这些速率取决于反应条件，如温度和反应物及产物的分压。理解这些关系有助于设计更有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应。
