          [1] "Oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption are both reduction processes on ceria, specifically causing the reduction of surface metal atoms."

[2] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane activation were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment."

[3] "We report the energies of oxygen vacancy formation for each surface, the preferred adsorption mode and sites for methane adsorption, and the dissociative methane adsorption energy."

[4] "Figure 7 shows the dissociative adsorption energy of methane plotted versus vacancy formation energy for each surface investigated."

[5] "The general trend between the energetics of vacancy formation and methane adsorption, however, suggests that the energy of methane adsorption on ceria surfaces is dependent on surface reducibility."

[6] "Dissociative methane adsorption proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical transition state in which a metal atom of the surface is reduced by a single electron. The activation barrier for this step, therefore, also correlates with the surface reducibility measured by the oxygen vacancy formation energy."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the reactant (e.g., methane) is oxidized by lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity. Surfaces that can more easily form oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) are typically more active for oxidation reactions. This is because the easier formation of vacancies facilitates the reaction between lattice oxygen and adsorbed species.

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv is also indicative of the oxide's oxidizing power. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more readily release its oxygen, making it a stronger oxidizing agent.

3. Surface reducibility: The study shows a clear correlation between oxygen vacancy formation energy and methane adsorption energy. Surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies (more reducible) exhibited more exothermic methane adsorption, suggesting higher reactivity.

4. Reaction energetics: The energy of dissociative methane adsorption correlates with the vacancy formation energy. Surfaces with lower ΔEv (more easily reducible) show more exothermic methane adsorption.

5. Activation barriers: The activation barrier for methane dissociation also correlates with surface reducibility. More reducible surfaces (lower ΔEv) tend to have lower activation barriers for methane activation.

In summary, ΔEv serves as a descriptor for the catalyst's ability to participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, influencing both its activity in oxidation reactions and its oxidizing power. The study demonstrates that understanding and manipulating this parameter can lead to the design of more effective catalysts for various oxidation processes.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，反应物（如甲烷）被晶格氧氧化，在催化剂表面创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧重新填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的催化活性。更容易形成氧空位（较低ΔEv）的表面通常对氧化反应更活跃。这是因为空位的更容易形成促进了晶格氧与吸附物种之间的反应。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv也表示氧化物的氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易释放其氧，使其成为更强的氧化剂。

3. 表面还原性：研究显示了氧空位形成能与甲烷吸附能之间的明确相关性。具有较低空位形成能（更易还原）的表面表现出更放热的甲烷吸附，表明反应性更高。

4. 反应能量学：甲烷解离吸附的能量与空位形成能相关。ΔEv较低（更易还原）的表面显示出更放热的甲烷吸附。

5. 活化能垒：甲烷解离的活化能垒也与表面还原性相关。更易还原的表面（较低ΔEv）倾向于具有较低的甲烷活化能垒。

总之，ΔEv作为催化剂参与Mars-van Krevelen机制能力的描述符，影响其在氧化反应中的活性和氧化能力。研究表明，理解和操纵这个参数可以导致设计出更有效的催化剂用于各种氧化过程。
