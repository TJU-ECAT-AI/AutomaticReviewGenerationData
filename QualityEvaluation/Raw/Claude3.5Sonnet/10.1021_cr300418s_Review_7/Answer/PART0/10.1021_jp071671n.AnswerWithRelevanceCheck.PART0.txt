          "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

"The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen."

"The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface."

"We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."

"Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through two main steps:

1. The species to be oxidized reacts with oxygen atoms on the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.
2. The reduced oxide is then re-oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen, healing the vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or OVFE) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It serves as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions.
2. It is used as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of an oxide or doped oxide.
3. Lower OVFE indicates that the oxide is a better oxidant, more willing to give up oxygen to create vacancies.
4. It reflects how easily the oxide can participate in the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Lower ΔEv means the oxide can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction.
5. It indirectly influences the second step of the mechanism, as the ability to form vacancies affects the subsequent adsorption and activation of gas-phase oxygen.
6. Lower OVFE generally correlates with higher oxidative power and potentially better catalytic performance, allowing reactions to proceed at lower temperatures and improving energy efficiency and selectivity.

By studying how various dopants affect the OVFE of oxide catalysts, researchers can potentially design more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidation reactions.

          Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两个主要步骤运作：

1. 待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。
2. 还原后的氧化物随后与气相氧反应重新氧化，修复氧空位。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv或OVFE）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它作为晶格氧参与Mars-van Krevelen氧化反应机理难易程度的衡量标准。
2. 它被用作判断氧化物或掺杂氧化物氧化能力的标准。
3. 较低的OVFE表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，更容易释放氧以创造空位。
4. 它反映了氧化物参与Mars-van Krevelen机制第一步的难易程度。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物能更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。
5. 它间接影响机制的第二步，因为形成空位的能力影响随后气相氧的吸附和活化。
6. 较低的OVFE通常与更高的氧化能力和潜在的更好催化性能相关，允许反应在较低温度下进行，提高能源效率和选择性。

通过研究各种掺杂剂如何影响氧化物催化剂的OVFE，研究人员可以潜在地设计出更高效和更具选择性的氧化反应催化剂。
