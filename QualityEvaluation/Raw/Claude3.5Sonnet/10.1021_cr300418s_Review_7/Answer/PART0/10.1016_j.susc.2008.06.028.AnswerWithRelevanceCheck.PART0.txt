          [1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant. A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr [3,4,11]."

[4] "The key finding is that upon doping of the (110) and (100) surfaces with Au, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is negative, indicating that if the system is in equilibrium, oxygen vacancies will be thermodynamically favourable."

[5] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

[6] "Since at sufficiently high temperature and an oxygen pressure of 1 atm almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them, it is the formation of a second oxygen vacancy that determines the oxidation activity of the doped surface."

[7] "The vacancy formation energies show that the dopant facilitates the formation of a second oxygen vacancy on (110) but not on (100), revealing a notable surface dependence that could be exploited in the design of nanostructured ceria catalysts."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle where:

1. The molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.
2. Oxygen from the gas phase then fills these vacancies, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen can be more easily removed from the surface, potentially increasing catalytic activity.
2. However, an optimal balance is needed - if oxygen is removed too easily, the surface may not effectively take oxygen from the gas phase to heal vacancies, potentially limiting its effectiveness as an oxidation catalyst.
3. Ceria's effectiveness as a catalyst stems from its relatively small ΔEv, which is related to its ability to change oxidation states from Ce4+ to Ce3+.
4. Doping, such as with Au or Zr, can further lower ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds, making oxygen removal even easier.
5. In some cases, like Au-doped ceria (110) and (100) surfaces, ΔEv becomes negative, indicating that oxygen vacancy formation becomes thermodynamically favorable.
6. The formation of a second oxygen vacancy, especially in doped surfaces, can be crucial in determining the oxidation activity of the catalyst.
7. Surface structure plays a role in the effect of doping, as demonstrated by the different behaviors of (110) and (100) surfaces when doped.

Thus, ΔEv serves as a key indicator of a material's potential as an oxidation catalyst, with lower values generally indicating higher activity, but with the caveat that extremely low values may impair the catalyst's ability to complete the full oxidation cycle. The design of effective catalysts involves optimizing this balance, potentially through strategies such as doping and controlling surface structure.

          Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过以下循环运作：

1. 待氧化的分子从氧化物表面获取氧，在表面形成氧空位。
2. 气相中的氧分子随后填补这些空位，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为：

1. 较低的ΔEv表明氧可以更容易从表面移除，可能增加催化活性。
2. 然而，需要一个最佳平衡 - 如果氧被移除得太容易，表面可能无法有效地从气相中获取氧来愈合空位，可能限制其作为氧化催化剂的有效性。
3. 氧化铈作为催化剂的有效性源于其相对较小的ΔEv，这与其能够从Ce4+变为Ce3+的氧化态变化能力有关。
4. 掺杂（如用Au或Zr）可以通过削弱金属-氧键进一步降低ΔEv，使氧的移除更加容易。
5. 在某些情况下，如Au掺杂的氧化铈(110)和(100)表面，ΔEv变为负值，表明氧空位形成在热力学上变得有利。
6. 第二个氧空位的形成，特别是在掺杂表面上，可能对决定催化剂的氧化活性至关重要。
7. 表面结构在掺杂效应中起着重要作用，如(110)和(100)表面在掺杂时表现出的不同行为所示。

因此，ΔEv作为材料作为氧化催化剂潜力的关键指标，较低的值通常表示较高的活性，但需要注意的是，极低的值可能会损害催化剂完成完整氧化循环的能力。设计有效的催化剂涉及优化这种平衡，可能通过掺杂和控制表面结构等策略来实现。
