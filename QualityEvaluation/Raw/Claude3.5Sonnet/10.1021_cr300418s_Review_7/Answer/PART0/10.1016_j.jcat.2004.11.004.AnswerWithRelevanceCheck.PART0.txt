          [1] "In the course of the reaction, Ce4+O is attacked and reduced by CO, and an oxygen vacancy can be created; then O2 reacts with the surface to regenerate a surface oxygen atom. At an atomic level, this implies that the O2 molecule dissociates at the vacancy site, with the formation of highly reactive atomic oxygen"

          [2] "Previous computer simulations predicted that the energy required to create oxygen vacancies on the planes was related to their stabilities. The stability of the {111} plane is greater than that of {001} or {110}, and thus it is inherently less reactive"

          [3] "In the case of CeO2 nanorods, the more reactive planes are exposed. Moreover, the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates the reactive planes can be well protected. Thus a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate better catalytic performance during reaction."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves a cycle where the oxide surface is reduced by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

          Lower ΔEv values correspond to more reactive surfaces that can more easily form oxygen vacancies, facilitating the redox cycle. This is demonstrated by the higher reactivity of CeO2 nanorods exposing {001} and {110} planes compared to nanoparticles with predominantly {111} planes. The more stable {111} planes have higher ΔEv, making them less reactive.

          The stability of crystal planes affects ΔEv, with less stable planes like {001} and {110} having lower ΔEv than more stable planes like {111}. This explains why CeO2 nanorods exposing {001} and {110} planes show higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to nanoparticles predominantly exposing {111} planes.

          The ability to maintain a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycle, as seen in the nanorods, is key to sustained catalytic performance. Thus, ΔEv serves as an indicator of how easily the catalyst can participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, directly impacting its oxidizing ability and overall catalytic activity.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及一个循环过程，其中氧化物表面被反应物（如CO）还原，产生氧空位，随后表面被气相氧重新氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

          较低的ΔEv值对应于更容易形成氧空位的更活性表面，有利于氧化还原循环。这一点从暴露{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒比主要暴露{111}晶面的纳米颗粒具有更高反应性得到了证实。更稳定的{111}晶面具有更高的ΔEv，使其反应性较低。

          晶面的稳定性影响ΔEv，较不稳定的晶面如{001}和{110}比更稳定的晶面如{111}具有更低的ΔEv。这解释了为什么暴露{001}和{110}晶面的CeO2纳米棒在CO氧化反应中表现出比主要暴露{111}晶面的纳米颗粒更高的催化活性。

          保持稳定的Ce4+/Ce3+氧化还原循环的能力，如在纳米棒中所观察到的，是维持催化性能的关键。因此，ΔEv作为催化剂参与Mars-van Krevelen机理容易程度的指标，直接影响其氧化能力和整体催化活性。
