          [1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

          [2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

          [3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

          [4] "A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy."

          The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). However, it offers relevant insights into the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

          The text indicates that oxygen vacancy (Ov) formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria, occurring alongside CO2 production. Oxygen vacancies are generally beneficial for O2 activation. The relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and catalytic activity is described as "volcano-like", with an optimal oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.5%. Beyond this point, increasing oxygen vacancy concentration leads to decreased activity.

          The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to form carbonates, which may act as reaction intermediates or spectators in the presence of oxygen vacancies. These carbonates can affect CO oxidation.

          While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned, the described process of oxygen removal from the catalyst surface to form CO2, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst, is consistent with this mechanism. Although the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not discussed, the observed relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and catalytic activity suggests that this energy requirement likely plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

          提供的文献并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于氧化铈催化剂上进行CO氧化中的作用的相关见解。

          文献表明，氧空位（Ov）的形成是氧化铈上CO氧化的一个重要步骤，伴随着CO2的生成。氧空位通常有利于O2的活化。氧空位浓度与催化活性之间的关系被描述为"火山型"，最佳氧空位浓度为1.5%。超过这个点，增加氧空位浓度会导致活性降低。

          文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应形成碳酸盐，这些碳酸盐在氧空位存在的情况下可能作为反应中间体或旁观者。这些碳酸盐可能会影响CO氧化。

          虽然没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但所描述的从催化剂表面移除氧以形成CO2，然后再氧化催化剂的过程与该机制一致。尽管没有讨论氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv），但观察到的氧空位浓度与催化活性之间的关系表明，这种能量需求可能在决定催化活性和氧化物表面的氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
