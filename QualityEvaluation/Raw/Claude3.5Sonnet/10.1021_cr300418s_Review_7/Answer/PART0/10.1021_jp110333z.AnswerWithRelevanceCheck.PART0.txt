          [1] "We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group)."

[2] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."

[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

[4] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

[5] "The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

[6] "If these two species are not removed promptly from the surface, their presence substantially lower the activity of the surface (by the chemical compensation effect) and they poison the catalyst. We may have a situation where the rate-limiting step is not the breaking of the CH bond but the removal of H and CH3 from the surface."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which is essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to operate efficiently. When ΔEv is lower, the oxide surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction, making it a more active catalyst.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct relationship to the oxide's ability to release and replenish oxygen during the catalytic cycle. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more easily form oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules. These vacancies can then be refilled by gas-phase oxygen or other oxidizing species, completing the catalytic cycle.

Additionally, other parameters (ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4) are mentioned, which along with ΔEv, provide a comprehensive picture of the oxide surface's reactivity. These parameters indicate how strongly the surface interacts with various species involved in catalytic reactions, further influencing the overall catalytic performance.

In the context of doped oxides, particularly those with low valence dopants (LVDs), the ΔEv is typically reduced compared to undoped oxides. This suggests that doping can be a strategy to enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces for reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, it may also lead to faster deactivation of the catalyst if the oxygen vacancies are not promptly refilled. The literature also points out a potential complication where the dissociation products of reactants (e.g., H and CH3 from methane) can act as compensating agents, potentially poisoning the catalyst if not removed promptly. This suggests that in some cases, the rate-limiting step in catalytic oxidation reactions might shift from the initial bond breaking to the removal of reaction intermediates from the surface.

In summary, ΔEv is a critical parameter in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, influencing both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. Its optimization, along with consideration of other factors such as surface reactivity and product removal, is crucial for designing effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这对于Mars-van Krevelen机理的有效运作至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧化物表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，使其成为更活跃的催化剂。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物在催化循环中释放和补充氧的能力直接相关。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易形成氧空位，这对于反应物分子的吸附和活化至关重要。这些空位随后可以被气相氧或其他氧化物种填充，完成催化循环。

此外，文章还提到了其他参数（ΔEH，ΔECH3和ΔECH4），这些参数与ΔEv一起，提供了氧化物表面反应性的全面图像。这些参数表明表面与催化反应中涉及的各种物种的相互作用强度，进一步影响整体催化性能。

在掺杂氧化物的背景下，特别是那些低价掺杂剂（LVDs）的氧化物，ΔEv通常比未掺杂的氧化物低。这表明掺杂可能是一种增强氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的策略，特别是对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的反应。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，但如果氧空位不能及时补充，也可能导致催化剂更快失活。文献还指出了一个潜在的复杂性，即反应物的解离产物（例如，来自甲烷的H和CH3）可以作为补偿剂，如果不及时移除，可能会使催化剂中毒。这表明在某些情况下，催化氧化反应的速率限制步骤可能会从初始键断裂转变为从表面移除反应中间体。

总之，ΔEv是Mars-van Krevelen机制中的一个关键参数，影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。优化ΔEv，同时考虑其他因素如表面反应性和产物移除，对于设计有效的氧化物催化剂进行氧化反应至关重要。
