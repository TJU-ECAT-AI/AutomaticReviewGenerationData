[1] "This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[2] "For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."

[3] "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface."

[4] "For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to significant reductions in the formation energy of the active oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which facilitates the oxidation of reactants. This makes the surface more catalytically active for oxidation reactions. The most favorable sites for oxygen removal are typically surface oxygens coordinated to two metal atoms rather than the dopant.

Doping with elements like Pd and Ni significantly reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to undoped surfaces. For example, Pd doping reduces ΔEv to around 1.3-1.4 eV on both (111) and (110) surfaces of ceria, much lower than undoped ceria. This enhancement in oxygen mobility and availability makes doped ceria surfaces more effective catalysts for oxidation reactions.

The lower ΔEv also indicates a higher oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more readily provide oxygen to oxidize reactants. However, if ΔEv becomes too low, it may reduce the stability of the oxide catalyst. Therefore, tuning ΔEv through doping allows optimization of catalytic performance by balancing activity and stability.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这有利于反应物的氧化。这使表面对氧化反应的催化活性更高。氧移除的最有利位点通常是与两个金属原子配位的表面氧，而不是与掺杂剂配位的氧。

用Pd和Ni等元素掺杂可显著降低氧空位形成能，相比未掺杂的表面。例如，Pd掺杂将氧化铈(111)和(110)表面的ΔEv降低到约1.3-1.4 eV，远低于未掺杂的氧化铈。这种氧移动性和可用性的增强使掺杂的氧化铈表面成为更有效的氧化反应催化剂。

较低的ΔEv也表明表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地提供氧来氧化反应物。然而，如果ΔEv变得太低，可能会降低氧化物催化剂的稳定性。因此，通过掺杂调节ΔEv可以通过平衡活性和稳定性来优化催化性能。
