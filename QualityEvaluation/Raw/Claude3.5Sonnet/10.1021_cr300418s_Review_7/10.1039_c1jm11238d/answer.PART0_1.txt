The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the species to be oxidized, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. This is because the more readily available the lattice oxygen is, the more efficiently it can participate in the oxidation process.

The significance of ΔEv is demonstrated in the study, where doping with Pd and Ni substantially reduced the formation energy of active oxygen vacancies compared to undoped surfaces. For example, Pd doping reduced the formation energy to 1.32 eV on the (111) surface and 1.36 eV on the (110) surface. This reduction in formation energy suggests that these doped surfaces would have enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions compared to undoped ceria surfaces.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. A surface with a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy can more easily release oxygen, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if the ΔEv is too low, the oxide might become unstable or over-reactive. Therefore, tuning the ΔEv through doping or other means allows for optimization of the oxide's catalytic properties for specific reactions or conditions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，表面氧原子与待氧化物种反应，在催化剂表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从晶格中移除氧更容易，这通常与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。这是因为晶格氧越容易获得，它就越能有效地参与氧化过程。

ΔEv的重要性在研究中得到了证明，其中用Pd和Ni掺杂显著降低了活性氧空位的形成能，相比于未掺杂的表面。例如，Pd掺杂将(111)表面的形成能降低到1.32 eV，(110)表面降低到1.36 eV。这种形成能的降低表明，这些掺杂表面与未掺杂的CeO2表面相比，将具有增强的氧化反应催化活性。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv相关。具有较低氧空位形成能的表面可以更容易地释放氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或过度反应。因此，通过掺杂或其他方法调节ΔEv允许优化氧化物的催化性能，以适应特定反应或条件。
