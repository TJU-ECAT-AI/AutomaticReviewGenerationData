[1] "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface. For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV."

[2] "The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."

[3] "This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, an oxygen vacancy is created when a lattice oxygen atom is removed to oxidize a reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the surface can participate in oxidation reactions. The study shows that doping ceria surfaces with Pd and Ni significantly reduces the formation energy of active oxygen vacancies compared to undoped surfaces, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. A surface with a lower ΔEv can more easily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may lead to over-oxidation of reactants or rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to excessive oxygen loss.

In the context of the study, the dramatic reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy for Pd and Ni doped ceria surfaces indicates that these doped materials could be more effective catalysts for oxidation reactions compared to undoped ceria. The most stable active oxygen vacancy sites were found to be surface oxygen atoms not coordinated to the dopant, which are easier to remove due to their coordination to two Ce atoms.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，当晶格氧原子被移除以氧化反应分子时，会创建一个氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这通常会导致更高的催化活性。这是因为创建氧空位越容易，表面就越容易参与氧化反应。研究表明，用Pd和Ni掺杂氧化铈表面显著降低了活性氧空位的形成能，相比未掺杂的表面，这表明催化活性得到了提高。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致反应物过度氧化或由于过度氧损失而导致催化剂快速失活。

在这项研究中，Pd和Ni掺杂的氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能显著降低，表明这些掺杂材料可能比未掺杂的氧化铈更有效地催化氧化反应。研究发现，最稳定的活性氧空位位点是未与掺杂剂配位的表面氧原子，由于它们与两个Ce原子配位，因此更容易移除。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, a surface oxygen atom reacts with the species to be oxidized, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. This is because the more readily available the lattice oxygen is, the more efficiently it can participate in the oxidation process.

The significance of ΔEv is demonstrated in the study, where doping with Pd and Ni substantially reduced the formation energy of active oxygen vacancies compared to undoped surfaces. For example, Pd doping reduced the formation energy to 1.32 eV on the (111) surface and 1.36 eV on the (110) surface. This reduction in formation energy suggests that these doped surfaces would have enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions compared to undoped ceria surfaces.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. A surface with a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy can more easily release oxygen, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if the ΔEv is too low, the oxide might become unstable or over-reactive. Therefore, tuning the ΔEv through doping or other means allows for optimization of the oxide's catalytic properties for specific reactions or conditions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，表面氧原子与待氧化物种反应，在催化剂表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从晶格中移除氧更容易，这通常与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。这是因为晶格氧越容易获得，它就越能有效地参与氧化过程。

ΔEv的重要性在研究中得到了证明，其中用Pd和Ni掺杂显著降低了活性氧空位的形成能，相比于未掺杂的表面。例如，Pd掺杂将(111)表面的形成能降低到1.32 eV，(110)表面降低到1.36 eV。这种形成能的降低表明，这些掺杂表面与未掺杂的CeO2表面相比，将具有增强的氧化反应催化活性。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv相关。具有较低氧空位形成能的表面可以更容易地释放氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或过度反应。因此，通过掺杂或其他方法调节ΔEv允许优化氧化物的催化性能，以适应特定反应或条件。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which facilitates the oxidation of reactants. This makes the surface more catalytically active for oxidation reactions. The most favorable sites for oxygen removal are typically surface oxygens coordinated to two metal atoms rather than the dopant.

Doping with elements like Pd and Ni significantly reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to undoped surfaces. For example, Pd doping reduces ΔEv to around 1.3-1.4 eV on both (111) and (110) surfaces of ceria, much lower than undoped ceria. This enhancement in oxygen mobility and availability makes doped ceria surfaces more effective catalysts for oxidation reactions.

The lower ΔEv also indicates a higher oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more readily provide oxygen to oxidize reactants. However, if ΔEv becomes too low, it may reduce the stability of the oxide catalyst. Therefore, tuning ΔEv through doping allows optimization of catalytic performance by balancing activity and stability.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这有利于反应物的氧化。这使表面对氧化反应的催化活性更高。氧移除的最有利位点通常是与两个金属原子配位的表面氧，而不是与掺杂剂配位的氧。

用Pd和Ni等元素掺杂可显著降低氧空位形成能，相比未掺杂的表面。例如，Pd掺杂将氧化铈(111)和(110)表面的ΔEv降低到约1.3-1.4 eV，远低于未掺杂的氧化铈。这种氧移动性和可用性的增强使掺杂的氧化铈表面成为更有效的氧化反应催化剂。

较低的ΔEv也表明表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地提供氧来氧化反应物。然而，如果ΔEv变得太低，可能会降低氧化物催化剂的稳定性。因此，通过掺杂调节ΔEv可以通过平衡活性和稳定性来优化催化性能。

[1] "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This is the ability of ceria to store and release oxygen depending on the reaction conditions, i.e. under oxygen poor conditions, oxygen is released and under oxygen rich conditions, oxygen is taken up, leading to reoxidation of ceria."

[2] "For the example of CO oxidation, it is now understood that enhancing oxygen vacancy formation is important—if this formation energy can be made smaller, then the oxidative power of ceria will be improved"

[3] "We compute the formation energy of this oxygen vacancy from

E (2O vac) = E (MCeO2−y) − {E (MCeO2−x) + 1/2E (O2)}, (2)"

[5] "For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the release and uptake of oxygen by the catalyst depending on reaction conditions. Under oxygen-poor conditions, the oxide releases oxygen, while under oxygen-rich conditions, it takes up oxygen and reoxidizes.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower formation energy for oxygen vacancies enhances the oxidative power of the catalyst. This is because a lower energy barrier for creating oxygen vacancies allows the oxide to more readily release oxygen for oxidation reactions.

The most active sites for oxygen vacancy formation are typically surface oxygen atoms coordinated to multiple metal atoms but not directly to dopant atoms. These sites have lower vacancy formation energies, making them easier to remove and thus more reactive in oxidation catalysis.

By doping the oxide surface with certain elements, the oxygen vacancy formation energy can be reduced, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This principle is used to design more effective catalysts for oxidation reactions and applications such as solid oxide fuel cells where oxygen vacancy formation and migration are important processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及催化剂根据反应条件释放和吸收氧气。在贫氧条件下，氧化物释放氧气；而在富氧条件下，它吸收氧气并重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的氧空位形成能可以增强催化剂的氧化能力。这是因为创建氧空位的能量障碍较低，使得氧化物能够更容易地释放氧用于氧化反应。

氧空位形成的最活跃位点通常是与多个金属原子配位但不直接与掺杂原子配位的表面氧原子。这些位点具有较低的空位形成能，更容易被移除，因此在氧化催化中反应性更高。

通过向氧化物表面掺杂某些元素，可以降低氧空位形成能，从而提高催化剂的性能。这一原理被用于设计更有效的氧化反应催化剂，以及固体氧化物燃料电池等应用，其中氧空位的形成和迁移是重要的过程。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, a surface oxygen atom is removed to oxidize the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. This is because the removal of oxygen is often the rate-limiting step in such reactions.

The significance of ΔEv is demonstrated in the study, where doping with Pd and Ni substantially reduced the formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy compared to the undoped surface. This reduction in ΔEv suggests that these doped surfaces would have higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

The study also found that the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant and is instead coordinated to two Ce atoms. This configuration makes it easier to remove the oxygen, further lowering the ΔEv and potentially enhancing the catalytic activity.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the associated ΔEv play a crucial role in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values, as achieved through doping in this study, generally indicate higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机制中，表面氧原子被移除以氧化反应物，从而创造一个氧空位。然后这个空位被气相氧补充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这通常会导致更高的氧化反应催化活性。这是因为氧的移除通常是此类反应中的限速步骤。

ΔEv的重要性在研究中得到了证明，其中用Pd和Ni掺杂显著降低了最稳定活性氧空位的形成能，相比于未掺杂的表面。这种ΔEv的降低表明这些掺杂表面在氧化反应中会有更高的催化活性。

研究还发现，最稳定的活性氧空位位置是表面上未与掺杂剂配位而是与两个Ce原子配位的氧。这种配置使得移除氧更容易，进一步降低了ΔEv，可能会增强催化活性。

总之，Mars-van Krevelen机制和相关的ΔEv在氧化物催化的氧化反应中起着至关重要的作用。较低的ΔEv值，如本研究中通过掺杂实现的那样，通常表明氧化物表面具有更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
