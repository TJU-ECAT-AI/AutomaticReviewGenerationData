[1] "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface. For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV."

[2] "The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."

[3] "This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, an oxygen vacancy is created when a lattice oxygen atom is removed to oxidize a reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the surface can participate in oxidation reactions. The study shows that doping ceria surfaces with Pd and Ni significantly reduces the formation energy of active oxygen vacancies compared to undoped surfaces, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. A surface with a lower ΔEv can more easily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may lead to over-oxidation of reactants or rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to excessive oxygen loss.

In the context of the study, the dramatic reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy for Pd and Ni doped ceria surfaces indicates that these doped materials could be more effective catalysts for oxidation reactions compared to undoped ceria. The most stable active oxygen vacancy sites were found to be surface oxygen atoms not coordinated to the dopant, which are easier to remove due to their coordination to two Ce atoms.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，当晶格氧原子被移除以氧化反应分子时，会创建一个氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这通常会导致更高的催化活性。这是因为创建氧空位越容易，表面就越容易参与氧化反应。研究表明，用Pd和Ni掺杂氧化铈表面显著降低了活性氧空位的形成能，相比未掺杂的表面，这表明催化活性得到了提高。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致反应物过度氧化或由于过度氧损失而导致催化剂快速失活。

在这项研究中，Pd和Ni掺杂的氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能显著降低，表明这些掺杂材料可能比未掺杂的氧化铈更有效地催化氧化反应。研究发现，最稳定的活性氧空位位点是未与掺杂剂配位的表面氧原子，由于它们与两个Ce原子配位，因此更容易移除。
