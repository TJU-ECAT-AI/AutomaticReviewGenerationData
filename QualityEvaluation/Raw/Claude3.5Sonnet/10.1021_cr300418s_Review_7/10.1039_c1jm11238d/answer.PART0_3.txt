[1] "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This is the ability of ceria to store and release oxygen depending on the reaction conditions, i.e. under oxygen poor conditions, oxygen is released and under oxygen rich conditions, oxygen is taken up, leading to reoxidation of ceria."

[2] "For the example of CO oxidation, it is now understood that enhancing oxygen vacancy formation is important—if this formation energy can be made smaller, then the oxidative power of ceria will be improved"

[3] "We compute the formation energy of this oxygen vacancy from

E (2O vac) = E (MCeO2−y) − {E (MCeO2−x) + 1/2E (O2)}, (2)"

[4] "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface."

[5] "For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the release and uptake of oxygen by the catalyst depending on reaction conditions. Under oxygen-poor conditions, the oxide releases oxygen, while under oxygen-rich conditions, it takes up oxygen and reoxidizes.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower formation energy for oxygen vacancies enhances the oxidative power of the catalyst. This is because a lower energy barrier for creating oxygen vacancies allows the oxide to more readily release oxygen for oxidation reactions.

The most active sites for oxygen vacancy formation are typically surface oxygen atoms coordinated to multiple metal atoms but not directly to dopant atoms. These sites have lower vacancy formation energies, making them easier to remove and thus more reactive in oxidation catalysis.

By doping the oxide surface with certain elements, the oxygen vacancy formation energy can be reduced, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This principle is used to design more effective catalysts for oxidation reactions and applications such as solid oxide fuel cells where oxygen vacancy formation and migration are important processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及催化剂根据反应条件释放和吸收氧气。在贫氧条件下，氧化物释放氧气；而在富氧条件下，它吸收氧气并重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的氧空位形成能可以增强催化剂的氧化能力。这是因为创建氧空位的能量障碍较低，使得氧化物能够更容易地释放氧用于氧化反应。

氧空位形成的最活跃位点通常是与多个金属原子配位但不直接与掺杂原子配位的表面氧原子。这些位点具有较低的空位形成能，更容易被移除，因此在氧化催化中反应性更高。

通过向氧化物表面掺杂某些元素，可以降低氧空位形成能，从而提高催化剂的性能。这一原理被用于设计更有效的氧化反应催化剂，以及固体氧化物燃料电池等应用，其中氧空位的形成和迁移是重要的过程。
