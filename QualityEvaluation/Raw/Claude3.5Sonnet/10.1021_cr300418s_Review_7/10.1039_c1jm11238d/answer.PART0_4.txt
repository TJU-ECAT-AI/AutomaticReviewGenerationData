[1] "This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[2] "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface."

[3] "For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, a surface oxygen atom is removed to oxidize the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. This is because the removal of oxygen is often the rate-limiting step in such reactions.

The significance of ΔEv is demonstrated in the study, where doping with Pd and Ni substantially reduced the formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy compared to the undoped surface. This reduction in ΔEv suggests that these doped surfaces would have higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

The study also found that the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant and is instead coordinated to two Ce atoms. This configuration makes it easier to remove the oxygen, further lowering the ΔEv and potentially enhancing the catalytic activity.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the associated ΔEv play a crucial role in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values, as achieved through doping in this study, generally indicate higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机制中，表面氧原子被移除以氧化反应物，从而创造一个氧空位。然后这个空位被气相氧补充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这通常会导致更高的氧化反应催化活性。这是因为氧的移除通常是此类反应中的限速步骤。

ΔEv的重要性在研究中得到了证明，其中用Pd和Ni掺杂显著降低了最稳定活性氧空位的形成能，相比于未掺杂的表面。这种ΔEv的降低表明这些掺杂表面在氧化反应中会有更高的催化活性。

研究还发现，最稳定的活性氧空位位置是表面上未与掺杂剂配位而是与两个Ce原子配位的氧。这种配置使得移除氧更容易，进一步降低了ΔEv，可能会增强催化活性。

总之，Mars-van Krevelen机制和相关的ΔEv在氧化物催化的氧化反应中起着至关重要的作用。较低的ΔEv值，如本研究中通过掺杂实现的那样，通常表明氧化物表面具有更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
