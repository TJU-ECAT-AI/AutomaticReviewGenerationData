[1] "The Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide's surface."

[2] "An example is alkane activation in which the breaking of the C–H bond results in binding of the H atom and the alkyl to two oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide."

[3] "Both mechanisms can be made more efficient by surface modifications that increase the chemical activity of the oxygen atoms in the surface. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

[4] "If a surface modification makes the oxide a very strong oxidant (e.g., by making the energy of vacancy formation very small), this will not make it a good oxidation catalyst because the reaction will reduce the oxide and oxygen from the gas phase will not be efficient in reoxidizing it."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxygen atom from the oxide's surface participating directly in the oxidation of the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. ΔEv serves as an indicator of the chemical activity of surface oxygen atoms. A lower ΔEv generally suggests that oxygen atoms are more reactive and can more easily participate in oxidation reactions.

2. Surface modifications that lower ΔEv can increase the efficiency of both the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and dissociative adsorption processes, potentially improving catalytic performance.

3. However, there is an optimal range for ΔEv. If it becomes too low, making the oxide a very strong oxidant, it can actually reduce catalytic effectiveness. This is because the surface may become too easily reduced, and subsequent reoxidation by gas-phase oxygen may be inefficient.

4. ΔEv affects the thermodynamic stability of reaction intermediates on the surface, influencing the overall reaction pathway and kinetics.

Therefore, while a lower ΔEv can enhance the oxidizing ability of the surface, there is a "moderation principle" at play. The ideal catalyst should activate surface oxygen enough to facilitate the reaction, but not so much that it becomes irreversibly reduced under reaction conditions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面的氧原子直接参与反应物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. ΔEv作为表面氧原子化学活性的指标。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧原子更具反应性，更容易参与氧化反应。

2. 降低ΔEv的表面改性可以提高Mars-van Krevelen机制和解离吸附过程的效率，潜在地提高催化性能。

3. 然而，ΔEv存在一个最佳范围。如果它变得太低，使氧化物成为非常强的氧化剂，实际上可能会降低催化效果。这是因为表面可能会太容易被还原，而随后通过气相氧的再氧化可能效率低下。

4. ΔEv影响表面反应中间体的热力学稳定性，从而影响整个反应路径和动力学。

因此，虽然较低的ΔEv可以增强表面的氧化能力，但存在一个"适度原则"。理想的催化剂应该适度地活化表面氧以促进反应，但不应过度活化以至于在反应条件下不可逆地被还原。
