The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the use of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that surface oxygen atoms are more reactive and can more easily participate in oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide surface may be too easily reduced and struggle to replenish its oxygen from the gas phase, potentially limiting its catalytic activity. The optimal catalyst strikes a balance, with a ΔEv low enough to activate surface oxygen, but not so low that the surface becomes permanently reduced. The steady-state concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface is determined by the competition between reduction (by the reactant) and oxidation (by gas-phase oxygen) processes.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及使用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化反应物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面氧原子更具反应性，可以更容易地参与氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物表面可能会过于容易被还原，并难以从气相中补充氧，可能会限制其催化活性。最佳催化剂需要达到平衡，ΔEv要足够低以激活表面氧，但又不能低到使表面永久还原。表面上氧空位的稳态浓度由还原（反应物）和氧化（气相氧）过程之间的竞争决定。
