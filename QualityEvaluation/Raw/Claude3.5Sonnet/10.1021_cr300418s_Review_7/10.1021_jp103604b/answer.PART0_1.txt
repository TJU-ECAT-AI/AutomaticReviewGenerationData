[1] "If the oxidation mechanism is Mars–van Krevelen, the oxygen atom used to oxidize the substrate must be replaced by oxygen from the gas phase; if the oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface, it should be hard to put it back."

[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation can be used as a crude predictor of the ability of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide to engage in chemical reactions."

[3] "A good dopant should activate the surface oxygen but not by too much."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. A surface oxygen atom from the oxide catalyst oxidizes the substrate.
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface.
3. The vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Lower ΔEv generally indicates higher reactivity of surface oxygen atoms, potentially improving catalytic activity.
2. However, if ΔEv is too low, oxygen becomes too easy to remove from the surface, making it difficult to replenish from the gas phase. This can lead to catalyst deactivation.
3. ΔEv serves as a rough predictor of the oxide surface's ability to participate in chemical reactions.

The ideal catalyst requires a balance - the surface oxygen should be activated enough to participate in reactions, but not so much that it cannot be easily replaced. This highlights the importance of finding an optimal ΔEv value for effective and sustainable catalytic performance.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中包括以下步骤：

1. 氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子氧化底物。
2. 这在催化剂表面创造了一个氧空位。
3. 然后由气相中的氧填补这个空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

1. 较低的ΔEv通常表明表面氧原子的反应性更高，可能会提高催化活性。
2. 然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧就变得太容易从表面移除，使其难以从气相中补充。这可能导致催化剂失活。
3. ΔEv作为氧化物表面参与化学反应能力的粗略预测指标。

理想的催化剂需要一个平衡 - 表面氧应该被足够活化以参与反应，但又不至于无法轻易被替换。这突显了找到最佳ΔEv值对于有效和可持续催化性能的重要性。
