[1] "We assume that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "Because the oxidation takes place by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, the energy of oxygen vacancy formation should be a good descriptor of the catalytic process."

[3] "Figure 7a shows that the easier it is to form an oxygen vacancy at b2, the higher the energy E1 of the reaction of CO with the surface. Figure 7b shows that the higher the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the lower the energy E3 of oxygen adsorption at the vacancy site."

[4] "Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates by having a surface oxygen atom oxidize a reactant, which is then removed from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is subsequently filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is a better oxidant, as it more readily gives up its oxygen atoms to react with the substrate. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide surface may be over-reduced and lose its ability to oxidize effectively.

The relationship between catalytic activity and ΔEv is not linear but follows a "volcano curve." This means that there is an optimal ΔEv value where the catalyst shows maximum activity. At this point, the oxide is able to release oxygen atoms readily enough to oxidize the substrate efficiently, but not so easily that it becomes over-reduced and loses its catalytic ability.

ΔEv also correlates with other important aspects of the catalytic cycle. A lower ΔEv is associated with a higher energy of CO reaction with the surface (E1) and a lower energy of oxygen adsorption at the vacancy site (E3). These relationships make ΔEv a useful descriptor for predicting and understanding the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过表面氧原子氧化反应物来运作，然后该氧原子从表面移除，留下氧空位。随后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，因为它更容易释放氧原子与基质反应。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物表面可能会过度还原，失去其有效氧化的能力。

催化活性与ΔEv之间的关系不是线性的，而是遵循"火山曲线"。这意味着存在一个最佳的ΔEv值，在这个点上催化剂显示最大活性。在这个点上，氧化物能够足够容易地释放氧原子以有效地氧化基质，但又不至于过于容易以至于变得过度还原并失去其催化能力。

ΔEv还与催化循环的其他重要方面相关。较低的ΔEv与表面CO反应能量（E1）较高以及氧在空位处吸附能量（E3）较低相关联。这些关系使得ΔEv成为预测和理解氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化行为的有用描述符。
