[1] "We assume that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "Because we are interested in using these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to know their structure in the presence of gas-phase oxygen. We found that at all reasonable oxygen pressures and temperatures V, Cr, Mo, and W will bind an oxygen atom from gas phase to form a compound that we denote by (MO)xTi1−xO2 (110), with M = Cr, Mo, W, or V."

[3] "Our calculations find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1−xO2 (110)—with M = V, W, Cr, or Mo—and in MnxTi1−xO2 is smaller than in TiO2 (110)."

[4] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[5] "The formation and the annihilation of the oxygen vacancies are critical steps in this Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and this suggests that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv) might be a good descriptor of the catalytic properties of doped oxides."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. A surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reactant (e.g., CO).
2. The oxygen atom is removed from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy.
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It serves as a descriptor of catalytic properties: A lower ΔEv generally indicates better catalytic activity, as it makes it easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface to participate in the oxidation reaction.

2. It influences oxidizing power: Oxides with lower ΔEv are typically better oxidants, as they can more readily provide oxygen atoms for the reaction.

3. It affects dopant effectiveness: Well-chosen dopants can lower ΔEv, making the doped oxide a better oxidant and catalyst than the undoped one.

4. It impacts reaction energetics: The energy of vacancy formation correlates with other important steps in the catalytic cycle, such as CO adsorption and O2 adsorption at vacancy sites.

5. It helps in catalyst screening: ΔEv can be used as a simple descriptor to predict and compare the potential catalytic activity of different doped oxides for oxidation reactions.

However, it's important to note that very low ΔEv values may lead to excessive reduction of the oxide surface, potentially diminishing its oxidizing ability. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is desired for the best catalytic performance.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. 表面氧原子氧化反应物（例如CO）。
2. 氧原子从表面移除，留下氧空位。
3. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它作为催化性能的描述符：较低的ΔEv通常表示更好的催化活性，因为它使从表面移除氧原子参与氧化反应变得更容易。

2. 它影响氧化能力：具有较低ΔEv的氧化物通常是更好的氧化剂，因为它们可以更容易地为反应提供氧原子。

3. 它影响掺杂剂的效果：精心选择的掺杂剂可以降低ΔEv，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂氧化物更好的氧化剂和催化剂。

4. 它影响反应能量学：空位形成能与催化循环中的其他重要步骤相关，如CO吸附和O2在空位处的吸附。

5. 它有助于催化剂筛选：ΔEv可以用作简单的描述符，预测和比较不同掺杂氧化物在氧化反应中的潜在催化活性。

然而，需要注意的是，非常低的ΔEv值可能导致氧化物表面过度还原，可能会降低其氧化能力。因此，为了获得最佳的催化性能，需要一个最优的ΔEv值。
