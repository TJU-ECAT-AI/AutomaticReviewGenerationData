The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, creating oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then replenished by oxygen from the gas phase. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

Lower ΔEv values indicate that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, making the oxide a better oxidant. This is because reactants can more readily remove oxygen from the surface. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may be reduced too easily, potentially limiting its oxidizing ability.

ΔEv serves as a good descriptor of catalytic activity because it influences two key steps in the catalytic cycle: the reaction of CO with surface oxygen and the adsorption of O2 at vacancy sites. Both of these steps show a linear relationship with ΔEv. This relationship suggests that there is likely an optimal ΔEv value for catalytic activity, where vacancy formation is neither too easy nor too difficult.

Doping the oxide can modify ΔEv, with the dopants studied in this research lowering the energy of vacancy formation. This makes the doped oxides better oxidants than their undoped counterparts. The role of the dopant is primarily to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, thereby enhancing the oxide's catalytic properties in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及从氧化物表面移除氧原子以氧化反应物，从而创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相中的氧补充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位更容易形成，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这是因为反应物可以更容易地从表面移除氧。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会被过于容易地还原，可能会限制其氧化能力。

ΔEv作为催化活性的良好描述符，因为它影响催化循环中的两个关键步骤：CO与表面氧的反应以及O2在空位处的吸附。这两个步骤都与ΔEv呈线性关系。这种关系表明，催化活性可能存在一个最佳的ΔEv值，在这个值处，空位形成既不会太容易也不会太困难。

掺杂氧化物可以修改ΔEv，本研究中研究的掺杂剂降低了空位形成的能量。这使得掺杂的氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。掺杂剂的作用主要是促进氧空位的形成，从而增强氧化物在氧化反应中的催化性能。
