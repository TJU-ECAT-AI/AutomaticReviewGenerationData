[1] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[2] "We assume that in the oxidation reactions the role of the dopant is to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies."

[3] "Because we are interested in using these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to know their structure in the presence of gas-phase oxygen."

[4] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv. These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates by utilizing lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, creating oxygen vacancies that are subsequently refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide surface can more easily release oxygen atoms to participate in oxidation reactions, making it a better oxidant. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may be over-reduced and lose its ability to effectively catalyze oxidation reactions. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the surface will be less reactive and have difficulty releasing oxygen atoms for oxidation.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to serve as a descriptor of catalytic activity. The energies of two key reactions in the catalytic cycle - CO reaction with surface oxygen and O2 adsorption at vacancy sites - are linearly related to ΔEv. This relationship allows ΔEv to be used as a predictor of catalytic performance, with an optimal ΔEv value likely resulting in the highest catalytic activity.

In the context of doped oxides, dopants that lower ΔEv generally enhance the oxide's oxidizing ability and catalytic activity compared to undoped oxides. However, the optimal catalytic performance is achieved when ΔEv is neither too high nor too low, suggesting a potential "volcano-like" relationship between catalytic activity and ΔEv.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的晶格氧原子来氧化反应物，创造氧空位，然后由气相氧重新填充这些空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面可以更容易地释放氧原子参与氧化反应，使其成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能会过度还原并失去有效催化氧化反应的能力。相反，如果ΔEv过高，表面将反应性较低，难以释放氧原子进行氧化。

ΔEv的重要性在于它能够作为催化活性的描述符。催化循环中两个关键反应的能量 - CO与表面氧的反应和O2在空位处的吸附 - 与ΔEv呈线性关系。这种关系使ΔEv可以用作预测催化性能的指标，最佳的ΔEv值可能会产生最高的催化活性。

在掺杂氧化物的背景下，降低ΔEv的掺杂剂通常会增强氧化物的氧化能力和催化活性，相比未掺杂的氧化物。然而，最佳的催化性能是在ΔEv既不太高也不太低时实现的，这表明催化活性和ΔEv之间可能存在"火山型"关系。
