          [1] "We assume that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "The formation and the annihilation of the oxygen vacancies are critical steps in this Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and this suggests that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv) might be a good descriptor of the catalytic properties of doped oxides."

[3] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[4] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv. These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."

[5] "Qualitatively, a plot of activity versus ΔEv2 will be a volcano curve."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. A surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reactant (e.g., CO).
2. The oxygen atom is removed from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy.
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. Descriptor of catalytic activity: ΔEv serves as a good descriptor of catalytic properties. The energies of two key reactions in the mechanism (CO reaction with surface oxygen and O2 adsorption at the vacancy) vary linearly with ΔEv.

2. Oxidizing power: Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide is a better oxidant, as it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface to participate in the oxidation reaction.

3. Effect of dopants: Dopants that lower ΔEv make the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones. They weaken the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increase their chemical activity.

4. Volcano relationship: The relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity is not simply linear. A plot of activity versus ΔEv2 is expected to show a volcano curve, indicating an optimal range for ΔEv where catalytic activity is maximized.

5. Catalyst screening: ΔEv can be used as a simple descriptor for screening potential catalysts, allowing researchers to predict which doped oxides might be more effective for oxidation reactions without extensive experimental testing.

It's important to note that very low ΔEv values may lead to excessive reduction of the oxide surface, potentially diminishing its oxidizing ability. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is desired for the best catalytic performance.

          Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. 表面氧原子氧化反应物（例如CO）。
2. 氧原子从表面移除，留下氧空位。
3. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 催化活性的描述符：ΔEv是催化性能的良好描述符。机理中两个关键反应（CO与表面氧的反应和O2在空位处的吸附）的能量与ΔEv呈线性关系。

2. 氧化能力：较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，因为从表面移除氧原子参与氧化反应更容易。

3. 掺杂剂的影响：降低ΔEv的掺杂剂使掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。它们削弱了相邻氧原子与表面的键合，增加了它们的化学活性。

4. 火山关系：ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系并非简单的线性关系。活性与ΔEv2的关系图预计会呈现火山曲线，表明存在一个ΔEv的最佳范围，在此范围内催化活性最大化。

5. 催化剂筛选：ΔEv可以用作筛选潜在催化剂的简单描述符，使研究人员能够预测哪些掺杂氧化物可能更有效地进行氧化反应，而无需进行大量实验测试。

需要注意的是，非常低的ΔEv值可能导致氧化物表面过度还原，可能会降低其氧化能力。因此，为了获得最佳的催化性能，需要一个最优的ΔEv值。
