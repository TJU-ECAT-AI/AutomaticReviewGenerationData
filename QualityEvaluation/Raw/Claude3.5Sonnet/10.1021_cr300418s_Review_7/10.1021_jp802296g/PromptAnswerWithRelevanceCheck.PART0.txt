[1] "We assume that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "Because we are interested in using these doped oxides as oxidation catalysts, we need to know their structure in the presence of gas-phase oxygen. We found that at all reasonable oxygen pressures and temperatures V, Cr, Mo, and W will bind an oxygen atom from gas phase to form a compound that we denote by (MO)xTi1−xO2 (110), with M = Cr, Mo, W, or V."

[3] "Our calculations find that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in (MO)xTi1−xO2 (110)—with M = V, W, Cr, or Mo—and in MnxTi1−xO2 is smaller than in TiO2 (110)."

[4] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[5] "The formation and the annihilation of the oxygen vacancies are critical steps in this Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and this suggests that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv) might be a good descriptor of the catalytic properties of doped oxides."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. A surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reactant (e.g., CO).
2. The oxygen atom is removed from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy.
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It serves as a descriptor of catalytic properties: A lower ΔEv generally indicates better catalytic activity, as it makes it easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface to participate in the oxidation reaction.

2. It influences oxidizing power: Oxides with lower ΔEv are typically better oxidants, as they can more readily provide oxygen atoms for the reaction.

3. It affects dopant effectiveness: Well-chosen dopants can lower ΔEv, making the doped oxide a better oxidant and catalyst than the undoped one.

4. It impacts reaction energetics: The energy of vacancy formation correlates with other important steps in the catalytic cycle, such as CO adsorption and O2 adsorption at vacancy sites.

5. It helps in catalyst screening: ΔEv can be used as a simple descriptor to predict and compare the potential catalytic activity of different doped oxides for oxidation reactions.

However, it's important to note that very low ΔEv values may lead to excessive reduction of the oxide surface, potentially diminishing its oxidizing ability. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is desired for the best catalytic performance.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. 表面氧原子氧化反应物（例如CO）。
2. 氧原子从表面移除，留下氧空位。
3. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它作为催化性能的描述符：较低的ΔEv通常表示更好的催化活性，因为它使从表面移除氧原子参与氧化反应变得更容易。

2. 它影响氧化能力：具有较低ΔEv的氧化物通常是更好的氧化剂，因为它们可以更容易地为反应提供氧原子。

3. 它影响掺杂剂的效果：精心选择的掺杂剂可以降低ΔEv，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂氧化物更好的氧化剂和催化剂。

4. 它影响反应能量学：空位形成能与催化循环中的其他重要步骤相关，如CO吸附和O2在空位处的吸附。

5. 它有助于催化剂筛选：ΔEv可以用作简单的描述符，预测和比较不同掺杂氧化物在氧化反应中的潜在催化活性。

然而，需要注意的是，非常低的ΔEv值可能导致氧化物表面过度还原，可能会降低其氧化能力。因此，为了获得最佳的催化性能，需要一个最优的ΔEv值。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates by utilizing lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, creating oxygen vacancies that are subsequently refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide surface can more easily release oxygen atoms to participate in oxidation reactions, making it a better oxidant. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may be over-reduced and lose its ability to effectively catalyze oxidation reactions. Conversely, if ΔEv is too high, the surface will be less reactive and have difficulty releasing oxygen atoms for oxidation.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to serve as a descriptor of catalytic activity. The energies of two key reactions in the catalytic cycle - CO reaction with surface oxygen and O2 adsorption at vacancy sites - are linearly related to ΔEv. This relationship allows ΔEv to be used as a predictor of catalytic performance, with an optimal ΔEv value likely resulting in the highest catalytic activity.

In the context of doped oxides, dopants that lower ΔEv generally enhance the oxide's oxidizing ability and catalytic activity compared to undoped oxides. However, the optimal catalytic performance is achieved when ΔEv is neither too high nor too low, suggesting a potential "volcano-like" relationship between catalytic activity and ΔEv.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的晶格氧原子来氧化反应物，创造氧空位，然后由气相氧重新填充这些空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面可以更容易地释放氧原子参与氧化反应，使其成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能会过度还原并失去有效催化氧化反应的能力。相反，如果ΔEv过高，表面将反应性较低，难以释放氧原子进行氧化。

ΔEv的重要性在于它能够作为催化活性的描述符。催化循环中两个关键反应的能量 - CO与表面氧的反应和O2在空位处的吸附 - 与ΔEv呈线性关系。这种关系使ΔEv可以用作预测催化性能的指标，最佳的ΔEv值可能会产生最高的催化活性。

在掺杂氧化物的背景下，降低ΔEv的掺杂剂通常会增强氧化物的氧化能力和催化活性，相比未掺杂的氧化物。然而，最佳的催化性能是在ΔEv既不太高也不太低时实现的，这表明催化活性和ΔEv之间可能存在"火山型"关系。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates by having a surface oxygen atom oxidize a reactant, which is then removed from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is subsequently filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is a better oxidant, as it more readily gives up its oxygen atoms to react with the substrate. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide surface may be over-reduced and lose its ability to oxidize effectively.

The relationship between catalytic activity and ΔEv is not linear but follows a "volcano curve." This means that there is an optimal ΔEv value where the catalyst shows maximum activity. At this point, the oxide is able to release oxygen atoms readily enough to oxidize the substrate efficiently, but not so easily that it becomes over-reduced and loses its catalytic ability.

ΔEv also correlates with other important aspects of the catalytic cycle. A lower ΔEv is associated with a higher energy of CO reaction with the surface (E1) and a lower energy of oxygen adsorption at the vacancy site (E3). These relationships make ΔEv a useful descriptor for predicting and understanding the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过表面氧原子氧化反应物来运作，然后该氧原子从表面移除，留下氧空位。随后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，因为它更容易释放氧原子与基质反应。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物表面可能会过度还原，失去其有效氧化的能力。

催化活性与ΔEv之间的关系不是线性的，而是遵循"火山曲线"。这意味着存在一个最佳的ΔEv值，在这个点上催化剂显示最大活性。在这个点上，氧化物能够足够容易地释放氧原子以有效地氧化基质，但又不至于过于容易以至于变得过度还原并失去其催化能力。

ΔEv还与催化循环的其他重要方面相关。较低的ΔEv与表面CO反应能量（E1）较高以及氧在空位处吸附能量（E3）较低相关联。这些关系使得ΔEv成为预测和理解氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化行为的有用描述符。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, creating oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then replenished by oxygen from the gas phase. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

Lower ΔEv values indicate that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, making the oxide a better oxidant. This is because reactants can more readily remove oxygen from the surface. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may be reduced too easily, potentially limiting its oxidizing ability.

ΔEv serves as a good descriptor of catalytic activity because it influences two key steps in the catalytic cycle: the reaction of CO with surface oxygen and the adsorption of O2 at vacancy sites. Both of these steps show a linear relationship with ΔEv. This relationship suggests that there is likely an optimal ΔEv value for catalytic activity, where vacancy formation is neither too easy nor too difficult.

Doping the oxide can modify ΔEv, with the dopants studied in this research lowering the energy of vacancy formation. This makes the doped oxides better oxidants than their undoped counterparts. The role of the dopant is primarily to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, thereby enhancing the oxide's catalytic properties in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及从氧化物表面移除氧原子以氧化反应物，从而创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相中的氧补充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位更容易形成，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。这是因为反应物可以更容易地从表面移除氧。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会被过于容易地还原，可能会限制其氧化能力。

ΔEv作为催化活性的良好描述符，因为它影响催化循环中的两个关键步骤：CO与表面氧的反应以及O2在空位处的吸附。这两个步骤都与ΔEv呈线性关系。这种关系表明，催化活性可能存在一个最佳的ΔEv值，在这个值处，空位形成既不会太容易也不会太困难。

掺杂氧化物可以修改ΔEv，本研究中研究的掺杂剂降低了空位形成的能量。这使得掺杂的氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。掺杂剂的作用主要是促进氧空位的形成，从而增强氧化物在氧化反应中的催化性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. A surface oxygen atom oxidizes the reactant (e.g., CO).
2. This oxidation removes the oxygen atom from the surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It serves as a good descriptor of catalytic activity, as the energies of two key reactions in the mechanism (CO reaction with surface oxygen and O2 adsorption at the vacancy) vary linearly with ΔEv.

2. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide is a better oxidant, as it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface to participate in the oxidation reaction.

3. Dopants that lower ΔEv make the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones, as they weaken the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increase their chemical activity.

4. The relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity is not simply linear. Very low ΔEv values may lead to excessive reduction of the oxide surface, while very high ΔEv values may make oxidation inefficient. This suggests an optimal range for ΔEv, likely resulting in a volcano-shaped plot of activity versus ΔEv.

5. ΔEv can be used as a simple descriptor for screening potential catalysts, allowing researchers to predict which doped oxides might be more effective for oxidation reactions without extensive experimental testing.

2. 这种氧化反应从表面移除氧原子，形成氧空位。
3. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它是催化活性的良好描述符，因为机理中两个关键反应（CO与表面氧的反应和O2在空位处的吸附）的能量与ΔEv呈线性关系。

2. 较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，因为从表面移除氧原子参与氧化反应更容易。

3. 降低ΔEv的掺杂剂使掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，因为它们削弱了相邻氧原子与表面的键合，增加了它们的化学活性。

4. ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系并非简单的线性关系。非常低的ΔEv值可能导致氧化物表面过度还原，而非常高的ΔEv值可能使氧化反应效率低下。这表明ΔEv可能存在一个最佳范围，很可能导致活性与ΔEv之间呈火山形曲线关系。

5. ΔEv可以用作筛选潜在催化剂的简单描述符，使研究人员能够预测哪些掺杂氧化物可能更有效地进行氧化反应，而无需进行大量实验测试。
