[1] "We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W). Rutile doped with Mn does not take an oxygen atom from the gas phase. We find that these materials oxidize CO by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which the role of the dopant is to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv. These are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."

[3] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

[4] "Our premise was that in many systems the presence of a well-chosen dopant weakens the bond of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increases their chemical activity. Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. A surface oxygen atom oxidizes the reactant (e.g., CO).
2. This oxidation removes the oxygen atom from the surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It serves as a good descriptor of catalytic activity, as the energies of two key reactions in the mechanism (CO reaction with surface oxygen and O2 adsorption at the vacancy) vary linearly with ΔEv.

2. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide is a better oxidant, as it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface to participate in the oxidation reaction.

3. Dopants that lower ΔEv make the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones, as they weaken the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the surface and increase their chemical activity.

4. The relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity is not simply linear. Very low ΔEv values may lead to excessive reduction of the oxide surface, while very high ΔEv values may make oxidation inefficient. This suggests an optimal range for ΔEv, likely resulting in a volcano-shaped plot of activity versus ΔEv.

5. ΔEv can be used as a simple descriptor for screening potential catalysts, allowing researchers to predict which doped oxides might be more effective for oxidation reactions without extensive experimental testing.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的运作方式如下：

1. 表面氧原子氧化反应物（如CO）。
2. 这种氧化反应从表面移除氧原子，形成氧空位。
3. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它是催化活性的良好描述符，因为机理中两个关键反应（CO与表面氧的反应和O2在空位处的吸附）的能量与ΔEv呈线性关系。

2. 较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物是更好的氧化剂，因为从表面移除氧原子参与氧化反应更容易。

3. 降低ΔEv的掺杂剂使掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，因为它们削弱了相邻氧原子与表面的键合，增加了它们的化学活性。

4. ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系并非简单的线性关系。非常低的ΔEv值可能导致氧化物表面过度还原，而非常高的ΔEv值可能使氧化反应效率低下。这表明ΔEv可能存在一个最佳范围，很可能导致活性与ΔEv之间呈火山形曲线关系。

5. ΔEv可以用作筛选潜在催化剂的简单描述符，使研究人员能够预测哪些掺杂氧化物可能更有效地进行氧化反应，而无需进行大量实验测试。
