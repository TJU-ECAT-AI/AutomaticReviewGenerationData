[1] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[2] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeO(2-x)+x/2mO2(g)-mCeO2."

[3] "The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U). Note that, as in the case of the formation energetics of the bulk oxides, the LDA+U value seems to be in better agreement with the experiments (4.7-5.0 eV from Table 1 in Ref. 23 and references therein) than the GGA+U result."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide catalysis.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is referred to as the "heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy" in the text. This energy is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Lower vacancy formation energy generally correlates with higher catalytic activity, as it makes it easier for the catalyst to participate in redox cycles.

3. The vacancy formation energy influences the oxide's ability to release and reincorporate oxygen, which is crucial for its oxidizing ability.

The literature reports calculated values for this energy in ceria: 5.05 eV using LDA+U method and 2.01 eV using GGA+U method. The LDA+U value (5.05 eV) is noted to be in better agreement with experimental values (4.7-5.0 eV), suggesting it may be a more accurate representation of the actual vacancy formation energy in ceria.

These values provide insight into the energetics of oxygen release from ceria, which is relevant to its catalytic behavior in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但它提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这对于氧化物催化中的Mars-van Krevelen机理至关重要。

文中将氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)称为"每个氧空位的还原热"。这个能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要，原因如下：

1. 它代表了从氧化物晶格中移除一个氧原子所需的能量成本，这是Mars-van Krevelen机理的关键步骤。

2. 较低的空位形成能通常与更高的催化活性相关，因为它使催化剂更容易参与氧化还原循环。

3. 空位形成能影响氧化物释放和重新结合氧的能力，这对其氧化能力至关重要。

文献报道了氧化铈中这种能量的计算值：使用LDA+U方法为5.05 eV，使用GGA+U方法为2.01 eV。文中指出，LDA+U值(5.05 eV)与实验值(4.7-5.0 eV)更为接近，表明它可能更准确地代表了氧化铈中实际的空位形成能。

这些值提供了氧化铈释放氧的能量学信息，这与其在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中的催化行为有关。
