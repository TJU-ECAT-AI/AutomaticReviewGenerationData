[1] "Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs."

[2] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+→Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[3] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: ΔHr=μCeO(2-x)+x/2μO2(g)-μCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides some relevant information about the role of oxygen vacancies in ceria-based catalysts.

Ceria-based materials act as oxygen reservoirs in catalytic reactions by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at reaction sites. This is achieved through the formation and filling of oxygen vacancies, which are closely linked to the ability of cerium to switch between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the literature, this is referred to as the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy (ΔHr). The calculated values for this energy are 5.05 eV using LDA+U and 2.01 eV using GGA+U methods.

A lower ΔEv (or ΔHr) generally indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, which would enhance the material's ability to release oxygen for oxidation reactions. This would likely lead to higher catalytic activity. Conversely, a higher ΔEv would make the material more stable but potentially less active as a catalyst.

The ability to control and predict this energy is crucial for designing effective ceria-based catalysts for various applications, such as hydrogen production and air pollution reduction.

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本提供了一些关于氧空位在基于铈的催化剂中作用的相关信息。

基于铈的材料通过控制反应位点的氧分压来充当催化反应中的氧储存库。这是通过形成和填充氧空位实现的，而氧空位与铈在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间切换的能力密切相关。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。在文献中，这被称为每个氧空位的还原热（ΔHr）。使用LDA+U方法计算的该能量值为5.05 eV，使用GGA+U方法计算的值为2.01 eV。

较低的ΔEv（或ΔHr）通常表示氧空位可以更容易形成，这将增强材料释放氧以进行氧化反应的能力。这可能会导致更高的催化活性。相反，较高的ΔEv会使材料更稳定，但可能作为催化剂的活性较低。

控制和预测这种能量对于设计各种应用的有效基于铈的催化剂至关重要，例如氢气生产和空气污染减少。
