[1] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+→Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[2] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: ΔHr=μCeO(2-x)+x/2μO2(g)-μCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."

The literature does not directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or discuss its operation in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are important in catalytic processes.

The document mentions that the properties of ceria-based materials, which are key components in many advanced catalysts, are controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are neutralized by the valence change of cerium ions from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This process is fundamental to ceria's ability to act as an oxygen reservoir in catalytic reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not explicitly discussed in terms of catalytic activity or oxidizing ability. However, the paper does calculate the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy (ΔHr), which is related to the energy needed to form oxygen vacancies. The values reported are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U), depending on the calculation method used.

While the document doesn't directly link these values to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability, the energy required for vacancy formation is generally important in determining these properties. A lower energy requirement for vacancy formation typically correlates with higher catalytic activity and better oxidizing ability, as it allows for easier oxygen release and uptake during catalytic cycles.

It's important to note that this paper focuses more on the computational methods for accurately modeling ceria and its defects, rather than on the specifics of catalytic mechanisms or performance.

文献并没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或其在氧化物催化氧化反应中的操作。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这些空位在催化过程中很重要。

文档提到，氧化铈基材料的性质（这些材料是许多先进催化剂的关键组成部分）是由氧空位的化学性质控制的。这些空位通过铈离子从Ce4+到Ce3+的价态变化而被中和。这个过程是氧化铈能够在催化反应中充当氧气储存库的基础。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）并没有明确地从催化活性或氧化能力的角度进行讨论。然而，该论文确实计算了每个氧空位的还原热（ΔHr），这与形成氧空位所需的能量有关。报告的值为5.05 eV（LDA+U）和2.01 eV（GGA+U），取决于所使用的计算方法。

虽然文档没有直接将这些值与催化活性或氧化能力联系起来，但空位形成所需的能量通常在决定这些性质时很重要。空位形成的能量要求较低通常与更高的催化活性和更好的氧化能力相关，因为它允许在催化循环中更容易释放和吸收氧气。

需要注意的是，这篇论文更多地关注于准确建模氧化铈及其缺陷的计算方法，而不是催化机制或性能的具体细节。
