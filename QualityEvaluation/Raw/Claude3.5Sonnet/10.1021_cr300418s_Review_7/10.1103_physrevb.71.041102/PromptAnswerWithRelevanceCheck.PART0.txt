[1] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeOs2xd+x/2mO2sgdmCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV sLDA+Ud and 2.01 eV sGGA+Ud."

The literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or explicitly relate the energy of oxygen vacancy formation to catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. However, the document does provide information on calculating the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy in ceria, which is related to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv).

The heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy is calculated using the chemical potential of molecular oxygen as a reference. The calculated values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U). The LDA+U value appears to be in better agreement with experimental results, which range from 4.7 to 5.0 eV.

While the document does not directly address the significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, the accurate calculation of this energy is crucial for understanding the behavior of oxide catalysts. The ability to form and heal oxygen vacancies is central to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, and the energy required for this process can influence the catalyst's activity and its capacity to oxidize reactants.

该文献并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，也没有明确地将氧空位形成能(ΔEv)与催化活性和氧化能力联系起来。然而，文档确实提供了计算铈中每个氧空位还原热的信息，这与氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)有关。

每个氧空位的还原热是使用分子氧的化学势作为参考来计算的。计算得到的值为5.05 eV (LDA+U)和2.01 eV (GGA+U)。LDA+U的值似乎与实验结果更为一致，实验结果范围在4.7到5.0 eV之间。

虽然文档没有直接讨论ΔEv在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性，但准确计算这个能量对于理解氧化物催化剂的行为至关重要。形成和愈合氧空位的能力是Mars-van Krevelen机制的核心，这个过程所需的能量可以影响催化剂的活性及其氧化反应物的能力。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide catalysis.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is referred to as the "heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy" in the text. This energy is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Lower vacancy formation energy generally correlates with higher catalytic activity, as it makes it easier for the catalyst to participate in redox cycles.

3. The vacancy formation energy influences the oxide's ability to release and reincorporate oxygen, which is crucial for its oxidizing ability.

The literature reports calculated values for this energy in ceria: 5.05 eV using LDA+U method and 2.01 eV using GGA+U method. The LDA+U value (5.05 eV) is noted to be in better agreement with experimental values (4.7-5.0 eV), suggesting it may be a more accurate representation of the actual vacancy formation energy in ceria.

These values provide insight into the energetics of oxygen release from ceria, which is relevant to its catalytic behavior in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但它提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这对于氧化物催化中的Mars-van Krevelen机理至关重要。

文中将氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)称为"每个氧空位的还原热"。这个能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要，原因如下：

1. 它代表了从氧化物晶格中移除一个氧原子所需的能量成本，这是Mars-van Krevelen机理的关键步骤。

2. 较低的空位形成能通常与更高的催化活性相关，因为它使催化剂更容易参与氧化还原循环。

3. 空位形成能影响氧化物释放和重新结合氧的能力，这对其氧化能力至关重要。

文献报道了氧化铈中这种能量的计算值：使用LDA+U方法为5.05 eV，使用GGA+U方法为2.01 eV。文中指出，LDA+U值(5.05 eV)与实验值(4.7-5.0 eV)更为接近，表明它可能更准确地代表了氧化铈中实际的空位形成能。

这些值提供了氧化铈释放氧的能量学信息，这与其在遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中的催化行为有关。

The literature does not directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or discuss its operation in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are important in catalytic processes.

The document mentions that the properties of ceria-based materials, which are key components in many advanced catalysts, are controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are neutralized by the valence change of cerium ions from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This process is fundamental to ceria's ability to act as an oxygen reservoir in catalytic reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not explicitly discussed in terms of catalytic activity or oxidizing ability. However, the paper does calculate the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy (ΔHr), which is related to the energy needed to form oxygen vacancies. The values reported are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U), depending on the calculation method used.

While the document doesn't directly link these values to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability, the energy required for vacancy formation is generally important in determining these properties. A lower energy requirement for vacancy formation typically correlates with higher catalytic activity and better oxidizing ability, as it allows for easier oxygen release and uptake during catalytic cycles.

It's important to note that this paper focuses more on the computational methods for accurately modeling ceria and its defects, rather than on the specifics of catalytic mechanisms or performance.

文献并没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或其在氧化物催化氧化反应中的操作。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这些空位在催化过程中很重要。

文档提到，氧化铈基材料的性质（这些材料是许多先进催化剂的关键组成部分）是由氧空位的化学性质控制的。这些空位通过铈离子从Ce4+到Ce3+的价态变化而被中和。这个过程是氧化铈能够在催化反应中充当氧气储存库的基础。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）并没有明确地从催化活性或氧化能力的角度进行讨论。然而，该论文确实计算了每个氧空位的还原热（ΔHr），这与形成氧空位所需的能量有关。报告的值为5.05 eV（LDA+U）和2.01 eV（GGA+U），取决于所使用的计算方法。

虽然文档没有直接将这些值与催化活性或氧化能力联系起来，但空位形成所需的能量通常在决定这些性质时很重要。空位形成的能量要求较低通常与更高的催化活性和更好的氧化能力相关，因为它允许在催化循环中更容易释放和吸收氧气。

需要注意的是，这篇论文更多地关注于准确建模氧化铈及其缺陷的计算方法，而不是催化机制或性能的具体细节。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides some relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The process typically includes the reduction of the catalyst by reaction with the reducing agent, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst by gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of ceria, this energy is referred to as the "heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy" in the text. The literature reports values of 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U) for this energy.

A lower ΔEv generally indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to higher catalytic activity as it facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, it might result in excessive vacancy formation, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the catalyst.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A moderate ΔEv allows for the creation of oxygen vacancies while maintaining sufficient oxidizing power. In ceria, the ability to easily switch between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states (as mentioned in the text) is crucial for its oxidizing properties and oxygen storage capacity.

While the text doesn't directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the information about oxygen vacancies and the energetics of their formation in ceria provides insight into why this material is an effective catalyst for oxidation reactions.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但是提供了一些关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这对Mars-van Krevelen机理至关重要。

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及到氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。这个过程通常包括催化剂与还原剂反应而被还原，随后催化剂被气相氧再氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。在氧化铈的情况下，文中将这种能量称为"每个氧空位的还原热"。文献报告了这种能量的值为5.05 eV（LDA+U）和2.01 eV（GGA+U）。

较低的ΔEv通常表示更容易形成氧空位，这可能导致更高的催化活性，因为它有利于晶格氧的释放，从而促进氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致过度的空位形成，potentially影响催化剂的结构完整性。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。适中的ΔEv允许创建氧空位，同时保持足够的氧化能力。在氧化铈中，Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间容易切换的能力（如文中所述）对其氧化性能和储氧能力至关重要。

虽然文本没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但关于氧化铈中氧空位及其形成能量学的信息为理解这种材料作为氧化反应有效催化剂的原因提供了洞见。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides some relevant information about the role of oxygen vacancies in ceria-based catalysts.

Ceria-based materials act as oxygen reservoirs in catalytic reactions by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at reaction sites. This is achieved through the formation and filling of oxygen vacancies, which are closely linked to the ability of cerium to switch between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the literature, this is referred to as the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy (ΔHr). The calculated values for this energy are 5.05 eV using LDA+U and 2.01 eV using GGA+U methods.

A lower ΔEv (or ΔHr) generally indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, which would enhance the material's ability to release oxygen for oxidation reactions. This would likely lead to higher catalytic activity. Conversely, a higher ΔEv would make the material more stable but potentially less active as a catalyst.

The ability to control and predict this energy is crucial for designing effective ceria-based catalysts for various applications, such as hydrogen production and air pollution reduction.

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本提供了一些关于氧空位在基于铈的催化剂中作用的相关信息。

基于铈的材料通过控制反应位点的氧分压来充当催化反应中的氧储存库。这是通过形成和填充氧空位实现的，而氧空位与铈在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间切换的能力密切相关。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。在文献中，这被称为每个氧空位的还原热（ΔHr）。使用LDA+U方法计算的该能量值为5.05 eV，使用GGA+U方法计算的值为2.01 eV。

较低的ΔEv（或ΔHr）通常表示氧空位可以更容易形成，这将增强材料释放氧以进行氧化反应的能力。这可能会导致更高的催化活性。相反，较高的ΔEv会使材料更稳定，但可能作为催化剂的活性较低。

控制和预测这种能量对于设计各种应用的有效基于铈的催化剂至关重要，例如氢气生产和空气污染减少。
