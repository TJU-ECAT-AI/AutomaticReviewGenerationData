[1] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations (substitutional CeCe' defects)."

[2] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeO(2-x)+x/2mO2(g)-mCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides some relevant information about oxygen vacancies in ceria, which are crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The process typically includes the reduction of the catalyst by reaction with the reducing agent, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst by gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of ceria, this energy is referred to as the "heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy" in the text. The literature reports values of 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U) for this energy.

A lower ΔEv generally indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to higher catalytic activity as it facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, it might result in excessive vacancy formation, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the catalyst.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A moderate ΔEv allows for the creation of oxygen vacancies while maintaining sufficient oxidizing power. In ceria, the ability to easily switch between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states (as mentioned in the text) is crucial for its oxidizing properties and oxygen storage capacity.

While the text doesn't directly address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the information about oxygen vacancies and the energetics of their formation in ceria provides insight into why this material is an effective catalyst for oxidation reactions.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但是提供了一些关于氧化铈中氧空位的相关信息，这对Mars-van Krevelen机理至关重要。

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及到氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。这个过程通常包括催化剂与还原剂反应而被还原，随后催化剂被气相氧再氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要。在氧化铈的情况下，文中将这种能量称为"每个氧空位的还原热"。文献报告了这种能量的值为5.05 eV（LDA+U）和2.01 eV（GGA+U）。

较低的ΔEv通常表示更容易形成氧空位，这可能导致更高的催化活性，因为它有利于晶格氧的释放，从而促进氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致过度的空位形成，potentially影响催化剂的结构完整性。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。适中的ΔEv允许创建氧空位，同时保持足够的氧化能力。在氧化铈中，Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间容易切换的能力（如文中所述）对其氧化性能和储氧能力至关重要。

虽然文本没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理，但关于氧化铈中氧空位及其形成能量学的信息为理解这种材料作为氧化反应有效催化剂的原因提供了洞见。
