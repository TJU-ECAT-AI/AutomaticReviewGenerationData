[1] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecular oxygen: DHr=mCeOs2xd+x/2mO2sgdmCeO2. The resulting values are 5.05 eV sLDA+Ud and 2.01 eV sGGA+Ud."

[2] "Note that, as in the case of the formation energetics of the bulk oxides, the LDA+U value seems to be in better agreement with the experiments s4.75.0 eV from Table 1 in Ref. 23 and references thereind than the GGA+U result."

The literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or explicitly relate the energy of oxygen vacancy formation to catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. However, the document does provide information on calculating the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy in ceria, which is related to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv).

The heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy is calculated using the chemical potential of molecular oxygen as a reference. The calculated values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U). The LDA+U value appears to be in better agreement with experimental results, which range from 4.7 to 5.0 eV.

While the document does not directly address the significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, the accurate calculation of this energy is crucial for understanding the behavior of oxide catalysts. The ability to form and heal oxygen vacancies is central to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, and the energy required for this process can influence the catalyst's activity and its capacity to oxidize reactants.

该文献并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，也没有明确地将氧空位形成能(ΔEv)与催化活性和氧化能力联系起来。然而，文档确实提供了计算铈中每个氧空位还原热的信息，这与氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)有关。

每个氧空位的还原热是使用分子氧的化学势作为参考来计算的。计算得到的值为5.05 eV (LDA+U)和2.01 eV (GGA+U)。LDA+U的值似乎与实验结果更为一致，实验结果范围在4.7到5.0 eV之间。

虽然文档没有直接讨论ΔEv在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性，但准确计算这个能量对于理解氧化物催化剂的行为至关重要。形成和愈合氧空位的能力是Mars-van Krevelen机制的核心，这个过程所需的能量可以影响催化剂的活性及其氧化反应物的能力。
