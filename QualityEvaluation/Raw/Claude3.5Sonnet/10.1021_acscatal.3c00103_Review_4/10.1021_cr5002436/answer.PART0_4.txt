[1] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[2] "High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance. However, most alumina supports are acidic, and therefore promoters are used to curb support acidity."

[3] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters."

[4] "Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Thermal stability: Supports must withstand harsh conditions during regeneration.

2. Acidity: Limited acidity is crucial to prevent side reactions like coke formation and isomerization.

3. Surface area and pore distribution: Large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are important for optimal metal particle dispersion.

4. Mechanical strength: This property contributes to catalyst durability.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Using high surface area alumina as a support due to its thermal stability and ability to maintain platinum dispersion.

2. Adding alkaline metal promoters (Li, Na, K) to reduce support acidity and suppress coke formation.

3. Doping with Zn or Mg to create less acidic and more thermally stable spinel phases.

4. Modifying platinum properties and suppressing side reactions through promoter addition.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing support properties and metal-support interactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。关键因素包括：

1. 热稳定性：载体必须能够承受再生过程中的苛刻条件。

2. 酸度：有限的酸度对于防止副反应如积碳和异构化至关重要。

3. 比表面积和孔分布：大的比表面积和均匀的孔径分布对于金属粒子的最佳分散很重要。

4. 机械强度：这一性质有助于催化剂的耐久性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 使用高比表面积的氧化铝作为载体，因为它具有热稳定性和保持铂分散的能力。

2. 添加碱金属促进剂（Li、Na、K）以降低载体酸度并抑制积碳形成。

3. 用Zn或Mg掺杂，创造酸度更低、热稳定性更高的尖晶石相。

4. 通过添加促进剂来改变铂的性质并抑制副反应。

这些策略旨在通过优化载体性质和金属-载体相互作用来提高催化效率和选择性。
