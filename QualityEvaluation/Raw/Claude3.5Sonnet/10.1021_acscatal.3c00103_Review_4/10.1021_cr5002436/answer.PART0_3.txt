[1] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization."

[2] "The chemistry of vanadium oxide is comparable to that of molybdenum oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."

[3] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."

[4] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

[5] "The transition of γ-alumina to θ-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Thermal stability: Supports must be thermally stable to withstand harsh hydrothermal conditions during regeneration.

2. Acidity: Limited support acidity is crucial to avoid side reactions like coke formation and alkane isomerization.

3. Morphology: The type of support used affects the dispersion and nature of active species (e.g., monomers, polymers, or crystallites).

4. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between the carrier and active phase impacts catalyst activity and selectivity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Addition of alkali metals: K, Rb, and Cs can stabilize the support structure, reduce surface acidity, and increase active sites.

2. Doping with larger cations: Adding cations with ionic radii larger than Al3+ (e.g., La3+) can prevent undesirable phase transitions and maintain high surface area.

3. Optimizing preparation methods: Using techniques that afford high dopant dispersion can enhance catalyst performance.

4. Controlling metal loading: Adjusting the amount of active metal can influence the formation of different species (monomers, polymers, crystallites) on the support surface.

By carefully tailoring these physicochemical properties and employing appropriate support modification strategies, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 热稳定性：载体必须具有热稳定性，以withstand再生过程中的harsh水热条件。

2. 酸度：限制载体酸度对于避免副反应如积碳形成和烷烃异构化至关重要。

3. 形态：所使用的载体类型影响活性物种的分散性和性质（如单体、聚合物或晶体）。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：载体与活性相之间的相互作用影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 添加碱金属：K、Rb和Cs可以稳定载体结构，降低表面酸度，增加活性位点。

2. 掺杂较大阳离子：添加离子半径大于Al3+的阳离子（如La3+）可以防止不良相转变并保持高比表面积。

3. 优化制备方法：使用能够实现高掺杂剂分散的技术可以提高催化剂性能。

4. 控制金属负载量：调整活性金属的数量可以影响载体表面不同物种（单体、聚合物、晶体）的形成。

通过仔细调整这些物理化学性质并采用适当的载体改性策略，可以优化催化剂以提高脱氢反应的效率和选择性。
