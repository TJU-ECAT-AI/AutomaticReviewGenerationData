[1] "To be commercially attractive, dehydrogenation catalysts must provide high olefin yields at high space velocities. In other words, catalysts should display high specific activity, which is to say good conversion at short contact times."

[2] "Indeed, studies on these processes are scant, which is why the mechanism explaining the progression from adsorbed atomic carbon to aromatic rings is still largely unknown."

[3] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."

[4] "Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[5] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Catalysts with low Brønsted acidity or poisoned acid sites show reduced coke formation, leading to better stability and longer catalyst lifetime.
- Stability: Catalysts that maintain their structure and active sites under reaction conditions perform better over time.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area: High surface area supports provide more active sites for the reaction, potentially increasing catalytic activity.
- Pore structure: Optimal pore size and distribution can enhance reactant diffusion and product desorption, improving overall efficiency.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Acid site control: Selecting supports with low intrinsic acidity or treating them to reduce acid site density.
2. Promoter addition: Incorporating elements like Sn in Pt-based catalysts to modify electronic properties and reduce coke formation.
3. Textural improvements: Optimizing support synthesis methods to achieve desired surface area and pore characteristics.
4. Chemical modification: Doping supports with elements that enhance stability or introduce beneficial functionalities.
5. Surface functionalization: Adding specific groups to the support surface to alter adsorption properties or create additional active sites.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between activity, stability, and coke resistance. The ideal catalyst would combine high olefin yields at high space velocities with long-term stability under reaction conditions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学特性：
- 酸强度：具有低Brønsted酸性或被毒化酸位的催化剂显示出减少的积炭形成，从而导致更好的稳定性和更长的催化剂寿命。
- 稳定性：在反应条件下保持其结构和活性位点的催化剂随时间表现更好。

2. 形态特征：
- 比表面积：高比表面积的载体提供更多的反应活性位点，可能增加催化活性。
- 孔结构：最佳的孔径和分布可以增强反应物扩散和产物脱附，提高整体效率。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 酸位控制：选择具有低内在酸性的载体或对其进行处理以降低酸位密度。
2. 助剂添加：在基于Pt的催化剂中引入Sn等元素，以改变电子性质并减少积炭形成。
3. 纹理改进：优化载体合成方法以获得所需的比表面积和孔特性。
4. 化学改性：用增强稳定性或引入有益功能的元素掺杂载体。
5. 表面功能化：在载体表面添加特定基团，以改变吸附性质或创造额外的活性位点。

这些策略旨在通过优化活性、稳定性和抗积炭能力之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。理想的催化剂将在高空速下结合高烯烃产率和反应条件下的长期稳定性。
