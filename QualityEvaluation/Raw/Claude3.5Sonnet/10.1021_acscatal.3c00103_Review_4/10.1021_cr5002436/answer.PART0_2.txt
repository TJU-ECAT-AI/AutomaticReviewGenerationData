[1] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[2] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10."

[3] "Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."

[4] "By hydrothermally treating γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation, the formation of additional hydroxyl groups results in a better Pt dispersion after impregnation and calcination."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Thermal stability is crucial, especially under harsh regeneration conditions.

2. Limited support acidity is necessary to prevent side reactions like coke formation and alkane isomerization.

3. Large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are important for optimal distribution of metallic particles.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) to poison acid sites and suppress coke formation.

2. Doping with Zn or Mg to create a less acidic and more thermally stable spinel phase, which also reduces platinum sintering.

3. Hydrothermal treatment of γ-Al2O3 to form additional hydroxyl groups, improving platinum dispersion.

4. Using materials with high surface area and controlled pore size distribution as supports.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by improving thermal stability, reducing unwanted side reactions, and optimizing the distribution and stability of active metal particles.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 热稳定性至关重要，尤其是在苛刻的再生条件下。

2. 有限的载体酸性是必要的，以防止副反应如积碳形成和烷烃异构化。

3. 大表面积和均匀的孔径分布对金属颗粒的最佳分布很重要。

载体改性策略以优化这些性质包括：

1. 添加碱金属（Li、Na、K）以毒化酸性位点并抑制积碳形成。

2. 用Zn或Mg掺杂以创造酸性更低、热稳定性更高的尖晶石相，这也减少了铂的烧结。

3. 对γ-Al2O3进行水热处理以形成额外的羟基，改善铂的分散度。

4. 使用具有高表面积和可控孔径分布的材料作为载体。

这些策略旨在通过提高热稳定性、减少不必要的副反应以及优化活性金属颗粒的分布和稳定性来提高催化效率和选择性。
