[1] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[2] "To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition."

[3] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[4] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material: Different supports affect the activity and selectivity of active species. For example, oligomeric chromium oxide species show highest activity on γ-alumina, while isolated chromia species are more active on SBA-15.

2. Acidity: Limited support acidity is crucial to avoid side reactions like coke formation and alkane isomerization. Adding magnesium oxide to molybdenum catalysts reduces acidity, increasing alkene selectivity and reducing coke deposition.

3. Thermal stability: Supports must be thermally stable under harsh hydrothermal conditions during regeneration steps.

4. Surface area and pore structure: A large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred for optimal distribution of metallic particles.

5. Chemical modification: Adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) to supports can poison acid sites, suppressing coke formation and modifying platinum properties to reduce side reactions.

6. Morphology: Support modification can affect the size and dispersion of active metal clusters, influencing catalyst performance.

These properties can be optimized through various support modification strategies:

1. Doping with alkaline metals to reduce acidity and suppress side reactions.
2. Using mixed oxides (e.g., molybdenum-magnesium) to balance acidity and improve selectivity.
3. Incorporating thermally stable materials to enhance catalyst longevity.
4. Controlling pore size and distribution to optimize active site accessibility.
5. Surface functionalization to tailor the electronic properties of active sites.

By carefully tuning these physicochemical properties, catalysts can be designed with enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 载体材料：不同的载体影响活性物种的活性和选择性。例如，在γ-氧化铝上，寡聚的氧化铬物种显示最高活性，而在SBA-15上，孤立的氧化铬物种活性更高。

2. 酸度：限制载体酸度对避免副反应如积碳和烷烃异构化至关重要。向钼催化剂中添加氧化镁可降低酸度，提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳。

3. 热稳定性：载体必须在再生步骤中的苛刻水热条件下保持热稳定性。

4. 表面积和孔结构：较大的表面积和均匀的孔径分布有利于金属粒子的最佳分布。

5. 化学改性：向载体添加碱金属（Li、Na、K）可毒化酸性位点，抑制积碳形成，并改变铂的性质以减少副反应。

6. 形态：载体改性可影响活性金属簇的大小和分散度，从而影响催化剂性能。

这些性质可以通过各种载体改性策略进行优化：

1. 掺杂碱金属以降低酸度并抑制副反应。
2. 使用混合氧化物（如钼-镁）以平衡酸度并提高选择性。
3. 引入热稳定材料以提高催化剂寿命。
4. 控制孔径和分布以优化活性位点的可及性。
5. 表面功能化以调节活性位点的电子性质。

通过精心调节这些物理化学性质，可以设计出具有更高效率、选择性和稳定性的脱氢反应催化剂。
