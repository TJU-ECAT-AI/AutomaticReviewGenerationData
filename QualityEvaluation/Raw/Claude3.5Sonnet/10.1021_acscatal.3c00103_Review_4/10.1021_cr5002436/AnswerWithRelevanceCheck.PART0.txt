          [1] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[2] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters."

[3] "Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."

[4] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[5] "To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition."

[6] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."

[7] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

[8] "The transition of γ-alumina to θ-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Thermal stability: Supports must withstand harsh hydrothermal conditions during regeneration.

2. Acidity: Limited support acidity is crucial to prevent side reactions like coke formation and alkane isomerization.

3. Surface area and pore structure: Large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are important for optimal distribution of metallic particles.

4. Chemical composition: Different supports affect the activity and selectivity of active species (e.g., oligomeric chromium oxide on γ-alumina vs. isolated chromia species on SBA-15).

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between the carrier and active phase impacts catalyst activity and selectivity.

6. Mechanical strength: This property contributes to catalyst durability.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) to poison acid sites, suppress coke formation, and modify platinum properties.

2. Doping with Zn or Mg to create less acidic and more thermally stable spinel phases, which also reduce platinum sintering.

3. Using mixed oxides (e.g., molybdenum-magnesium) to balance acidity and improve selectivity.

4. Adding larger cations (e.g., La3+) to prevent undesirable phase transitions and maintain high surface area.

5. Optimizing preparation methods to achieve high dopant dispersion and desired support properties.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by improving thermal stability, reducing unwanted side reactions, optimizing the distribution and stability of active metal particles, and tailoring the electronic properties of active sites.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 热稳定性：载体必须能够withstand再生过程中的苛刻水热条件。

2. 酸度：有限的载体酸度对于防止副反应如积碳形成和烷烃异构化至关重要。

3. 比表面积和孔结构：大的比表面积和均匀的孔径分布对金属粒子的最佳分布很重要。

4. 化学成分：不同的载体影响活性物种的活性和选择性（例如，γ-氧化铝上的寡聚氧化铬物种vs. SBA-15上的孤立氧化铬物种）。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：载体与活性相之间的相互作用影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

6. 机械强度：这一性质有助于催化剂的耐久性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 添加碱金属（Li、Na、K、Rb、Cs）以毒化酸性位点，抑制积碳形成，并改变铂的性质。

2. 用Zn或Mg掺杂以创造酸性更低、热稳定性更高的尖晶石相，这也减少了铂的烧结。

3. 使用混合氧化物（如钼-镁）以平衡酸度并提高选择性。

4. 添加较大的阳离子（如La3+）以防止不良相转变并保持高比表面积。

5. 优化制备方法以实现高掺杂剂分散和所需的载体性质。

这些策略旨在通过提高热稳定性、减少不必要的副反应、优化活性金属颗粒的分布和稳定性，以及调整活性位点的电子性质来提高催化效率和选择性。
