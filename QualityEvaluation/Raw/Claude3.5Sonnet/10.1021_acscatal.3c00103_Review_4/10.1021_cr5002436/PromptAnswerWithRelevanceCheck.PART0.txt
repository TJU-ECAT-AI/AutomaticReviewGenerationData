[1] "To be commercially attractive, dehydrogenation catalysts must provide high olefin yields at high space velocities. In other words, catalysts should display high specific activity, which is to say good conversion at short contact times."

[2] "Indeed, studies on these processes are scant, which is why the mechanism explaining the progression from adsorbed atomic carbon to aromatic rings is still largely unknown."

[3] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."

[4] "Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[5] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Catalysts with low Brønsted acidity or poisoned acid sites show reduced coke formation, leading to better stability and longer catalyst lifetime.
- Stability: Catalysts that maintain their structure and active sites under reaction conditions perform better over time.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area: High surface area supports provide more active sites for the reaction, potentially increasing catalytic activity.
- Pore structure: Optimal pore size and distribution can enhance reactant diffusion and product desorption, improving overall efficiency.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Acid site control: Selecting supports with low intrinsic acidity or treating them to reduce acid site density.
2. Promoter addition: Incorporating elements like Sn in Pt-based catalysts to modify electronic properties and reduce coke formation.
3. Textural improvements: Optimizing support synthesis methods to achieve desired surface area and pore characteristics.
4. Chemical modification: Doping supports with elements that enhance stability or introduce beneficial functionalities.
5. Surface functionalization: Adding specific groups to the support surface to alter adsorption properties or create additional active sites.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between activity, stability, and coke resistance. The ideal catalyst would combine high olefin yields at high space velocities with long-term stability under reaction conditions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学特性：
- 酸强度：具有低Brønsted酸性或被毒化酸位的催化剂显示出减少的积炭形成，从而导致更好的稳定性和更长的催化剂寿命。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 酸位控制：选择具有低内在酸性的载体或对其进行处理以降低酸位密度。
2. 助剂添加：在基于Pt的催化剂中引入Sn等元素，以改变电子性质并减少积炭形成。
3. 纹理改进：优化载体合成方法以获得所需的比表面积和孔特性。
4. 化学改性：用增强稳定性或引入有益功能的元素掺杂载体。
5. 表面功能化：在载体表面添加特定基团，以改变吸附性质或创造额外的活性位点。

这些策略旨在通过优化活性、稳定性和抗积炭能力之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。理想的催化剂将在高空速下结合高烯烃产率和反应条件下的长期稳定性。

[1] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[2] "To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition."

[3] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[4] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Support material: Different supports affect the activity and selectivity of active species. For example, oligomeric chromium oxide species show highest activity on γ-alumina, while isolated chromia species are more active on SBA-15.

2. Acidity: Limited support acidity is crucial to avoid side reactions like coke formation and alkane isomerization. Adding magnesium oxide to molybdenum catalysts reduces acidity, increasing alkene selectivity and reducing coke deposition.

3. Thermal stability: Supports must be thermally stable under harsh hydrothermal conditions during regeneration steps.

4. Surface area and pore structure: A large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred for optimal distribution of metallic particles.

5. Chemical modification: Adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) to supports can poison acid sites, suppressing coke formation and modifying platinum properties to reduce side reactions.

6. Morphology: Support modification can affect the size and dispersion of active metal clusters, influencing catalyst performance.

These properties can be optimized through various support modification strategies:

1. Doping with alkaline metals to reduce acidity and suppress side reactions.
2. Using mixed oxides (e.g., molybdenum-magnesium) to balance acidity and improve selectivity.
3. Incorporating thermally stable materials to enhance catalyst longevity.
4. Controlling pore size and distribution to optimize active site accessibility.
5. Surface functionalization to tailor the electronic properties of active sites.

By carefully tuning these physicochemical properties, catalysts can be designed with enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization."

[2] "The chemistry of vanadium oxide is comparable to that of molybdenum oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."

[3] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."

[4] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

[5] "The transition of γ-alumina to θ-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina."
