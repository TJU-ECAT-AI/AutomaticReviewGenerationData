The physicochemical properties of Zn-modified zeolite catalysts, particularly the nature of Zn species (Zn2+ cations or ZnO clusters), significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide synergistic effects with Brønsted acid sites (BAS) for propane C-H bond activation, resulting in a dramatic acceleration of H/D exchange between propane and BAS. The isolated Zn2+ cations demonstrate a more pronounced accelerating effect compared to zinc oxide clusters.

To optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies can focus on controlling the nature and distribution of Zn species in the zeolite. For instance, the solid-state exchange reaction of BAS with metallic zinc vapor leads to the formation of isolated Zn2+ cations as the main state of zinc inside the zeolite pores. This approach can be used to enhance the catalytic performance, as Zn2+ cations show a stronger accelerating effect on the H/D exchange reaction.

Another strategy involves the controlled formation of small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores, which can be achieved through methods such as the adsorption and hydrolysis of dimethylzinc. While ZnO clusters also provide synergistic effects with BAS, their impact on catalytic performance is slightly lower than that of isolated Zn2+ cations.

By fine-tuning the preparation methods and conditions, researchers can optimize the balance between Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters to achieve the desired catalytic properties for specific dehydrogenation reactions. This tailored approach can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in processes such as propane aromatization.

Zn改性沸石催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是Zn物种的性质（Zn2+阳离子或ZnO簇），显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。Zn2+和ZnO物种都与Brønsted酸位点（BAS）产生协同效应，用于活化丙烷的C-H键，导致丙烷与BAS之间的H/D交换显著加速。与氧化锌簇相比，isolated Zn2+阳离子表现出更明显的加速效果。

为了优化催化效率和选择性，支持体改性策略可以集中于控制沸石中Zn物种的性质和分布。例如，BAS与金属锌蒸气的固态交换反应导致isolated Zn2+阳离子成为沸石孔内锌的主要存在状态。这种方法可用于提高催化性能，因为Zn2+阳离子对H/D交换反应表现出更强的加速效果。

另一种策略涉及在沸石孔内控制形成小的ZnO簇，这可以通过二甲基锌的吸附和水解等方法实现。虽然ZnO簇也与BAS提供协同效应，但它们对催化性能的影响略低于isolated Zn2+阳离子。

通过微调制备方法和条件，研究人员可以优化Zn2+阳离子和ZnO簇之间的平衡，以实现特定脱氢反应所需的催化性能。这种量身定制的方法可以提高诸如丙烷芳构化等过程中的催化效率和选择性。
