[1] "The studies of the composition and the state of zinc introduced into the zeolites by the ion exchange methods have shown the presence of different Zn-species: isolated Zn2+ cations and zinc oxide particles of various dimensions and localization."

[2] "ZSM-5 zeolite containing only Zn2+ cations and BAS was shown to activate small alkanes, including methane"

[3] "Zn-modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite containing only zinc oxide ZnmOn clusters and BAS also showed an enhanced catalytic activity in propane conversion towards the aromatics"

[4] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how different zinc species (Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters) affect the catalytic activity of zeolites:

1. Acid strength and stability: The presence of Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters enhances the catalytic activity of zeolites compared to pure acid-form zeolites. Both species accelerate the H/D exchange reaction, with Zn2+ cations showing a slightly higher effect.

2. Morphological characteristics: The size and localization of zinc oxide particles influence the catalyst's performance. Small ZnO clusters inside zeolite pores and larger particles on the outer surface of zeolite crystals contribute to the overall catalytic activity.

3. Support modification strategies:
   a) Ion exchange methods can introduce different Zn-species into zeolites.
   b) Solid-state exchange reaction with metallic zinc vapor can create isolated Zn2+ cations.
   c) Chemical vapor deposition of dimethylzinc followed by hydrolysis can form small ZnO clusters inside zeolite pores.

These modification strategies allow for the optimization of zinc species distribution and concentration, which in turn affects the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. The synergistic effect between Zn species (both Zn2+ and ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of the zeolite is crucial for enhancing the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to improved catalytic performance in reactions such as propane aromatization.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了不同锌物种（Zn2+阳离子和ZnO簇）如何影响沸石的催化活性：

1. 酸强度和稳定性：Zn2+阳离子和ZnO簇的存在增强了沸石的催化活性，相比纯酸性沸石。这两种物种都加速了H/D交换反应，其中Zn2+阳离子显示出略高的效果。

2. 形态特征：氧化锌颗粒的大小和位置影响催化剂的性能。沸石孔内的小ZnO簇和沸石晶体外表面的较大颗粒共同贡献于整体催化活性。

3. 载体改性策略：
   a) 离子交换方法可以将不同的Zn物种引入沸石。
   b) 与金属锌蒸气的固态交换反应可以创建孤立的Zn2+阳离子。
   c) 二甲基锌的化学气相沉积followed by水解可以在沸石孔内形成小的ZnO簇。

这些改性策略允许优化锌物种的分布和浓度，进而影响催化剂在脱氢反应中的效率和选择性。锌物种（包括Zn2+和ZnO）与沸石的Brønsted酸位点（BAS）之间的协同效应对增强烷烃C-H键的活化至关重要，从而提高了诸如丙烷芳构化等反应中的催化性能。
