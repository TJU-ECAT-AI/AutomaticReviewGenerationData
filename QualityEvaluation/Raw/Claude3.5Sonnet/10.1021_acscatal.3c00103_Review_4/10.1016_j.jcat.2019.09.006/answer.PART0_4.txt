The physicochemical properties of Zn-modified zeolite catalysts, including the nature of Zn species (Zn2+ cations or ZnO clusters), significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide synergistic effects with Brønsted acid sites (BAS) for propane C-H bond activation, leading to dramatic acceleration of H/D exchange. The presence of isolated Zn2+ cations shows a more pronounced accelerating effect compared to zinc oxide clusters. 

Support modification strategies to optimize catalyst properties include:

1. Controlling the state of zinc species: Isolated Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters can be selectively introduced into zeolites using different preparation methods.

2. Tuning acid strength and stability: The interaction between Zn species and BAS plays a crucial role in catalyst performance.

3. Optimizing morphological characteristics: The location and distribution of Zn species within the zeolite framework affect catalytic efficiency.

4. Balancing Zn loading: The amount of Zn introduced impacts the synergistic effect with BAS and overall catalyst performance.

These strategies can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the synergistic effects between metal species and acid sites, as well as improving the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes.

Zn改性沸石催化剂的物理化学性质，包括Zn物种的性质（Zn2+阳离子或ZnO簇），显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。Zn2+和ZnO物种都与布朗斯特酸位点（BAS）协同作用，促进丙烷C-H键的活化，导致H/D交换的显著加速。与氧化锌簇相比，孤立的Zn2+阳离子表现出更明显的加速效应。

优化催化剂性能的载体改性策略包括：

1. 控制锌物种的状态：可以通过不同的制备方法选择性地将孤立的Zn2+阳离子或小型ZnO簇引入沸石中。

2. 调节酸强度和稳定性：Zn物种与BAS之间的相互作用对催化剂性能起着至关重要的作用。

3. 优化形态特征：Zn物种在沸石骨架中的位置和分布影响催化效率。

4. 平衡Zn负载量：引入的Zn数量影响其与BAS的协同效应和催化剂的整体性能。

这些策略可以通过优化金属物种与酸位点之间的协同效应，以及改善烷烃C-H键的活化，来提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
