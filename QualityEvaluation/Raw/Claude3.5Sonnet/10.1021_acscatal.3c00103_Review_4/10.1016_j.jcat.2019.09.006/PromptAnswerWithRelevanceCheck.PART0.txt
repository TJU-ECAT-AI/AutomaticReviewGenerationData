The physicochemical properties of Zn-modified zeolite catalysts, particularly the nature of Zn species (Zn2+ cations or ZnO clusters), significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide synergistic effects with Brønsted acid sites (BAS) for propane C-H bond activation, resulting in a dramatic acceleration of H/D exchange between propane and BAS. The isolated Zn2+ cations demonstrate a more pronounced accelerating effect compared to zinc oxide clusters.

To optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies can focus on controlling the nature and distribution of Zn species in the zeolite. For instance, the solid-state exchange reaction of BAS with metallic zinc vapor leads to the formation of isolated Zn2+ cations as the main state of zinc inside the zeolite pores. This approach can be used to enhance the catalytic performance, as Zn2+ cations show a stronger accelerating effect on the H/D exchange reaction.

Another strategy involves the controlled formation of small ZnO clusters inside the zeolite pores, which can be achieved through methods such as the adsorption and hydrolysis of dimethylzinc. While ZnO clusters also provide synergistic effects with BAS, their impact on catalytic performance is slightly lower than that of isolated Zn2+ cations.

By fine-tuning the preparation methods and conditions, researchers can optimize the balance between Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters to achieve the desired catalytic properties for specific dehydrogenation reactions. This tailored approach can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in processes such as propane aromatization.

Zn改性沸石催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是Zn物种的性质（Zn2+阳离子或ZnO簇），显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。Zn2+和ZnO物种都与Brønsted酸位点（BAS）产生协同效应，用于活化丙烷的C-H键，导致丙烷与BAS之间的H/D交换显著加速。与氧化锌簇相比，isolated Zn2+阳离子表现出更明显的加速效果。

为了优化催化效率和选择性，支持体改性策略可以集中于控制沸石中Zn物种的性质和分布。例如，BAS与金属锌蒸气的固态交换反应导致isolated Zn2+阳离子成为沸石孔内锌的主要存在状态。这种方法可用于提高催化性能，因为Zn2+阳离子对H/D交换反应表现出更强的加速效果。

另一种策略涉及在沸石孔内控制形成小的ZnO簇，这可以通过二甲基锌的吸附和水解等方法实现。虽然ZnO簇也与BAS提供协同效应，但它们对催化性能的影响略低于isolated Zn2+阳离子。

通过微调制备方法和条件，研究人员可以优化Zn2+阳离子和ZnO簇之间的平衡，以实现特定脱氢反应所需的催化性能。这种量身定制的方法可以提高诸如丙烷芳构化等过程中的催化效率和选择性。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how different zinc species (Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters) affect the catalytic activity of zeolites:

1. Acid strength and stability: The presence of Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters enhances the catalytic activity of zeolites compared to pure acid-form zeolites. Both species accelerate the H/D exchange reaction, with Zn2+ cations showing a slightly higher effect.

2. Morphological characteristics: The size and localization of zinc oxide particles influence the catalyst's performance. Small ZnO clusters inside zeolite pores and larger particles on the outer surface of zeolite crystals contribute to the overall catalytic activity.

3. Support modification strategies:
   a) Ion exchange methods can introduce different Zn-species into zeolites.
   b) Solid-state exchange reaction with metallic zinc vapor can create isolated Zn2+ cations.
   c) Chemical vapor deposition of dimethylzinc followed by hydrolysis can form small ZnO clusters inside zeolite pores.

These modification strategies allow for the optimization of zinc species distribution and concentration, which in turn affects the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. The synergistic effect between Zn species (both Zn2+ and ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of the zeolite is crucial for enhancing the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to improved catalytic performance in reactions such as propane aromatization.

[1] "Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied."

[2] "The peculiarities of the H/D exchange of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA could be further rationalized in terms of three possible mechanisms."

[3] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher."

[4] "For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane."

The study examines how different Zn species (Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters) in modified zeolites affect catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species accelerate the H/D exchange reaction compared to pure acid-form zeolites, with Zn2+ cations showing a greater effect. The chemical properties of these species influence reaction mechanisms and selectivity. 

Zn2+ cations provide regioselective exchange into methyl groups throughout the reaction, while ZnO clusters only show initial regioselectivity followed by exchange into methylene groups. This difference is attributed to how strongly propylene intermediates are held by each species, affecting subsequent reaction steps.

Support modification strategies explored include introducing isolated Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters into zeolite pores. These modifications alter acid strength and stability of active sites, as well as their interactions with reactants and intermediates. The study demonstrates how tailoring the nature and distribution of Zn species can optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

这项研究考察了改性沸石中不同的Zn物种（Zn2+阳离子和ZnO簇）如何影响丙烷脱氢反应的催化性能。与纯酸性沸石相比，Zn2+和ZnO物种都加速了H/D交换反应，其中Zn2+阳离子的效果更显著。这些物种的化学性质影响反应机理和选择性。

Zn2+阳离子在整个反应过程中提供对甲基的区域选择性交换，而ZnO簇仅在反应初期表现出区域选择性，随后与亚甲基进行交换。这种差异归因于每种物种对丙烯中间体的保持强度不同，从而影响后续反应步骤。

探索的载体改性策略包括在沸石孔道中引入孤立的Zn2+阳离子或小型ZnO簇。这些改性改变了活性位点的酸强度和稳定性，以及它们与反应物和中间体的相互作用。研究表明，通过调整Zn物种的性质和分布可以优化脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
