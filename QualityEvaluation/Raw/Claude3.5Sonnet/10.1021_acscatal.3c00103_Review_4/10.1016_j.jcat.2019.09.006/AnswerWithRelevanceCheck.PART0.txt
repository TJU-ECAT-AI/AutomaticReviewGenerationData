          [1] "Zn-modified zeolites exhibit high activity for the aromatization of C2+ alkanes."
          
          [2] "The catalysts, which are traditionally prepared by the ion exchange or impregnation of ZSM-5 zeolite (ammonia- or acid-form) with aqueous solution of zinc salts, have demonstrated significantly higher activity and selectivity for aromatics as compared to the catalysts based on pure acid-form ZSM-5 zeolite"
          
          [3] "The studies of the composition and the state of zinc introduced into the zeolites by the ion exchange methods have shown the presence of different Zn-species: isolated Zn2+ cations and zinc oxide particles of various dimensions and localization."
          
          [4] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide synergy with BAS for propane CH bond activation."
          
          [5] "Zn2+ and ZnO species show dramatic acceleration of H/D exchange of propane with BAS."
          
          [6] "The accelerating effect of isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced compared to zinc oxide clusters."
          
          [7] "ZSM-5 zeolite containing only Zn2+ cations and BAS was shown to activate small alkanes, including methane"
          
          [8] "Zn-modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite containing only zinc oxide ZnmOn clusters and BAS also showed an enhanced catalytic activity in propane conversion towards the aromatics"
          
          [9] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher."
          
          [10] "Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied."
          
          [11] "For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key aspects include:

          1. Chemical composition: The presence of Zn species (Zn2+ cations and ZnO particles) in zeolites enhances catalytic activity and selectivity compared to pure acid-form zeolites.

          2. Acid strength and stability: Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites work synergistically with Zn species to activate CH bonds in alkanes, including propane and methane.

          3. Metal dispersion: Different Zn species (isolated Zn2+ cations and ZnO particles of various dimensions) are present in the zeolites, affecting their catalytic properties.

          4. Morphological characteristics: The size and localization of zinc oxide particles influence the catalyst's performance.

          Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

          1. Controlled metal loading: Adjusting the amount and type of Zn species introduced into the zeolite.

          2. Tailored preparation techniques: Using specific methods like ion exchange, impregnation, solid-state exchange reaction with metallic zinc vapor, or chemical vapor deposition of dimethylzinc followed by hydrolysis to achieve desired Zn species distribution.

          3. Post-synthesis treatments: Modifying the zeolite structure to optimize the synergy between Zn species and BAS.

          4. Balancing metal and acid sites: Optimizing the ratio of Zn species to BAS for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

          These strategies can lead to dramatic acceleration of reactions, such as H/D exchange of propane with BAS, demonstrating the potential for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. The study shows that isolated Zn2+ cations generally provide a more pronounced accelerating effect compared to zinc oxide clusters, and different Zn species can affect reaction mechanisms and selectivity differently.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键方面包括：

          1. 化学成分：沸石中锌物种（Zn2+阳离子和ZnO颗粒）的存在与纯酸性沸石相比，提高了催化活性和选择性。

          2. 酸强度和稳定性：沸石中的布朗斯特酸位点（BAS）与锌物种协同作用，激活烷烃（包括丙烷和甲烷）中的CH键。

          3. 金属分散度：沸石中存在不同的锌物种（孤立的Zn2+阳离子和不同尺寸的ZnO颗粒），影响其催化性能。

          4. 形态特征：氧化锌颗粒的大小和位置影响催化剂的性能。

          优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

          1. 受控金属负载：调整引入沸石的锌物种的数量和类型。

          2. 定制制备技术：使用特定方法如离子交换、浸渍、与金属锌蒸气的固态交换反应，或二甲基锌的化学气相沉积followed by水解，以达到所需的锌物种分布。

          3. 后合成处理：修改沸石结构，优化锌物种和BAS之间的协同作用。

          4. 平衡金属和酸位点：优化锌物种与BAS的比例，以提高催化效率和选择性。

          这些策略可以导致反应的显著加速，如丙烷与BAS的H/D交换，展示了在脱氢反应中提高催化效率和选择性的潜力。研究表明，孤立的Zn2+阳离子通常比氧化锌簇提供更明显的加速效果，不同的锌物种可以不同地影响反应机理和选择性。
