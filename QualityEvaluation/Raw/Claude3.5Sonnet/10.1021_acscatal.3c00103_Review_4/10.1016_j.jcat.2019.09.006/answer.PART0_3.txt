[1] "Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied."

[2] "The peculiarities of the H/D exchange of propane on Zn2+/H-BEA could be further rationalized in terms of three possible mechanisms."

[3] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher."

[4] "For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane."

The study examines how different Zn species (Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters) in modified zeolites affect catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species accelerate the H/D exchange reaction compared to pure acid-form zeolites, with Zn2+ cations showing a greater effect. The chemical properties of these species influence reaction mechanisms and selectivity. 

Zn2+ cations provide regioselective exchange into methyl groups throughout the reaction, while ZnO clusters only show initial regioselectivity followed by exchange into methylene groups. This difference is attributed to how strongly propylene intermediates are held by each species, affecting subsequent reaction steps.

Support modification strategies explored include introducing isolated Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters into zeolite pores. These modifications alter acid strength and stability of active sites, as well as their interactions with reactants and intermediates. The study demonstrates how tailoring the nature and distribution of Zn species can optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

这项研究考察了改性沸石中不同的Zn物种（Zn2+阳离子和ZnO簇）如何影响丙烷脱氢反应的催化性能。与纯酸性沸石相比，Zn2+和ZnO物种都加速了H/D交换反应，其中Zn2+阳离子的效果更显著。这些物种的化学性质影响反应机理和选择性。

Zn2+阳离子在整个反应过程中提供对甲基的区域选择性交换，而ZnO簇仅在反应初期表现出区域选择性，随后与亚甲基进行交换。这种差异归因于每种物种对丙烯中间体的保持强度不同，从而影响后续反应步骤。

探索的载体改性策略包括在沸石孔道中引入孤立的Zn2+阳离子或小型ZnO簇。这些改性改变了活性位点的酸强度和稳定性，以及它们与反应物和中间体的相互作用。研究表明，通过调整Zn物种的性质和分布可以优化脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
