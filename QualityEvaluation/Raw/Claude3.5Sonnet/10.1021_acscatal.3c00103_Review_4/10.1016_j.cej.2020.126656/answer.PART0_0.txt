[1] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites. The band at higher wavenumber, centered at 3738 cm1, is assigned to type IIa hydroxyls"

[2] "Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species."

[3] "Ca donates electron to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene."

[4] "The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites"

[5] "Ca also enhances the selectivity towards propylene as discussed previously."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acid strength: Ca suppresses strong acid sites on the catalyst support, which reduces unwanted side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis. This leads to improved selectivity towards the desired product (propylene) and enhanced catalyst stability.

2. Chemical stability: Ca promotes the reduction of both Pt and Ge species, leading to better alloy formation between Pt and Ge. This modification of the catalyst's chemical state affects its activity and selectivity.

3. Electronic properties: Ca donates electrons to Pt, weakening the interaction between Pt and propylene. This facilitates propylene desorption, potentially improving selectivity by reducing unwanted side reactions.

4. Morphological characteristics: The addition of Ca affects the degree of Pt-Ge alloy formation, which modifies the geometry and reactivity of the resulting nanoparticles. This can impact the catalyst's activity and apparent activation energy.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adding Ca to the alumina support to suppress strong acid sites and modify the electronic state of active metals.

2. Promoting the reduction of metal species (like Ge) to enhance alloy formation with the active metal (Pt).

3. Tailoring the support's acidity to balance activity and selectivity by controlling the amount and type of promoter added.

4. Modifying the metal-support interaction to influence the dispersion and electronic properties of active metal particles.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency by improving selectivity, stability, and resistance to deactivation, while maintaining an optimal level of activity for the dehydrogenation reaction.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸强度：Ca抑制了催化剂载体上的强酸位点，减少了不需要的副反应如裂解和氢解。这导致了目标产物（丙烯）选择性的提高和催化剂稳定性的增强。

2. 化学稳定性：Ca促进了Pt和Ge物种的还原，导致Pt和Ge之间更好的合金形成。这种催化剂化学状态的改变影响了其活性和选择性。

3. 电子性质：Ca向Pt捐赠电子，减弱了Pt与丙烯之间的相互作用。这促进了丙烯的脱附，可能通过减少不需要的副反应来提高选择性。

4. 形态特征：Ca的添加影响了Pt-Ge合金形成的程度，这改变了所形成纳米粒子的几何形状和反应性。这可能影响催化剂的活性和表观活化能。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 向氧化铝载体添加Ca，以抑制强酸位点并修改活性金属的电子状态。

2. 促进金属物种（如Ge）的还原，以增强与活性金属（Pt）的合金形成。

3. 通过控制添加的促进剂的数量和类型来调节载体的酸度，以平衡活性和选择性。

4. 修改金属-载体相互作用，以影响活性金属粒子的分散和电子性质。

这些策略旨在通过提高选择性、稳定性和抗失活能力来增强催化效率，同时为脱氢反应保持最佳活性水平。
