[1] "Ca suppresses strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[2] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[3] "Ca-promoted catalyst is less active for coke deactivation, (ψd)."

[4] "The addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

[5] "Upon modifying support with Ca, the desorption temperatures shift to lower temperature, suggesting that Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption."

[6] "Adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3. As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acid strength and stability of the catalyst support play a crucial role in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Support modification strategies, particularly the addition of calcium (Ca), can be employed to optimize these properties:

1. Acidity reduction: Ca suppresses strong acidic sites on the catalyst support, leading to a sharp decrease in total acidity. This reduction in acidity helps prevent unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

2. Enhanced alloy formation: Ca accelerates the reduction of other promoter elements (e.g., Sn), resulting in a higher percentage of alloy formation with the active metal (e.g., Pt). This can improve the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

3. Electronic property modification: Ca modifies the electronic properties of the active metal, which can suppress deep dehydrogenation reactions and facilitate coke desorption.

4. Improved desorption characteristics: Ca addition facilitates the desorption of reaction products (e.g., propylene), which can enhance selectivity by reducing the occurrence of secondary reactions.

5. Coke resistance: Ca-promoted catalysts show lower activity for coke formation, improving catalyst stability and longevity.

6. Morphological effects: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, the addition of promoters like Ca can also affect the dispersion and particle size of the active metal, influencing the catalyst's overall performance.

These modifications collectively contribute to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the balance between acidity, metal-support interactions, and resistance to deactivation.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。催化剂载体的酸强度和稳定性在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

可以采用载体改性策略，特别是添加钙（Ca），来优化这些性质：

1. 降低酸度：Ca抑制催化剂载体上的强酸性位点，导致总酸度急剧下降。这种酸度的降低有助于防止不必要的副反应和焦炭形成。

2. 增强合金形成：Ca加速其他促进元素（如Sn）的还原，导致与活性金属（如Pt）形成更高比例的合金。这可以提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. 电子性质修饰：Ca修饰活性金属的电子性质，可以抑制深度脱氢反应并促进焦炭脱附。

4. 改善脱附特性：Ca的添加促进反应产物（如丙烯）的脱附，通过减少二次反应的发生来提高选择性。

5. 抗焦炭性：添加Ca的催化剂对焦炭形成的活性较低，提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

6. 形态效应：虽然在引用中没有明确提到，但像Ca这样的促进剂的添加也可能影响活性金属的分散度和粒径，从而影响催化剂的整体性能。

这些改性综合起来通过优化酸度、金属-载体相互作用和抗失活能力之间的平衡，有助于提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
