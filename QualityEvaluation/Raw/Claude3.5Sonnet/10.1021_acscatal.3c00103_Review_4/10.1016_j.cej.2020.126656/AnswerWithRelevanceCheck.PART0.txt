          [1] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites. The band at higher wavenumber, centered at 3738 cm1, is assigned to type IIa hydroxyls"

[2] "Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species."

[3] "Ca donates electron to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene."

[4] "The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites"

[5] "Ca also enhances the selectivity towards propylene as discussed previously."

[6] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[7] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[8] "Ca decreases acidity, ii- increase of Pt dispersion, and iii- prevention of sintering of metal particles."

[9] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."

[10] "The disappearance of the first peak, which is related to the coke species on the metal sites, supports the further reduction of GeOx species in the Ca-promoted-sample, enhancing the geometric modification of Pt and, therefore, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation."

[11] "The fading of the second peak clearly highlights the positive role of Ca in suppressing acidic centres."

[12] "The higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge."

[13] "Ca-promoted catalyst is less active for coke deactivation, (ψd)."

[14] "The addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

[15] "Upon modifying support with Ca, the desorption temperatures shift to lower temperature, suggesting that Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption."

[16] "Adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3. As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of calcium (Ca) as a support modification strategy can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

1. Acid strength and acidity:
- Ca suppresses strong acid sites on various supports (ZSM-5, Al2O3), leading to a sharp decrease in total acidity.
- This reduction in acidity helps prevent unwanted side reactions such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and deep dehydrogenation.
- The decrease in acid centers contributes to improved propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Chemical stability and alloy formation:
- Ca promotes the reduction of both Pt and Ge species, as well as accelerates Sn reduction.
- This results in a higher degree of alloy formation between the active metal (Pt) and promoters (Ge, Sn).
- Enhanced alloy formation leads to improved catalyst stability and selectivity.

3. Electronic properties:
- Ca donates electrons to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene.
- This modification of electronic properties suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption.

4. Morphological characteristics:
- Ca addition increases Pt dispersion and prevents sintering of metal particles.
- It enhances the geometric modification of Pt, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation.

5. Desorption characteristics:
- Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption by shifting desorption temperatures to lower values.

6. Coke resistance:
- Ca-promoted catalysts show lower activity for coke formation and deactivation.
- The increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke facilitates its desorption.

7. Activation energy:
- Ca promotion can lead to higher activation energy for the main reaction, related to the enhanced reduction of promoter species (e.g., GeOx).

These modifications collectively contribute to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the balance between acidity, metal-support interactions, and resistance to deactivation. The result is improved propylene selectivity, increased catalyst stability, and reduced coke formation.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。添加钙（Ca）作为载体改性策略可以优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性：

1. 酸强度和酸度：
- Ca抑制各种载体（ZSM-5、Al2O3）上的强酸位点，导致总酸度急剧下降。
- 这种酸度的降低有助于防止不必要的副反应，如裂解、氢解和深度脱氢。
- 酸中心的减少有助于提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 化学稳定性和合金形成：
- Ca促进Pt和Ge物种的还原，并加速Sn的还原。
- 这导致活性金属（Pt）与促进剂（Ge、Sn）之间形成更高程度的合金。
- 增强的合金形成导致催化剂稳定性和选择性的提高。

3. 电子性质：
- Ca向Pt捐赠电子，导致Pt与丙烯之间的相互作用减弱。
- 这种电子性质的修饰抑制了深度脱氢，并促进了积炭的脱附。

4. 形态特征：
- Ca的添加增加了Pt的分散度，并防止金属颗粒的烧结。
- 它增强了Pt的几何修饰，减少了其裂解和积炭形成的能力。

5. 脱附特性：
- Ca的添加通过将脱附温度降低来促进丙烯的脱附。

6. 抗积炭性：
- 添加Ca的催化剂对积炭形成和失活的活性较低。
- 缺氢积炭的H/C比增加促进了其脱附。

7. 活化能：
- Ca的促进可能导致主反应的活化能增加，这与促进剂物种（如GeOx）的增强还原有关。

这些改性综合起来通过优化酸度、金属-载体相互作用和抗失活能力之间的平衡，有助于提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。结果是丙烯选择性提高，催化剂稳定性增加，积炭形成减少。
