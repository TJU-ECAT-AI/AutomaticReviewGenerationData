[1] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[2] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[3] "Ca decreases acidity, ii- increase of Pt dispersion, and iii- prevention of sintering of metal particles."

[4] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."

[5] "The disappearance of the first peak, which is related to the coke species on the metal sites, supports the further reduction of GeOx species in the Ca-promoted-sample, enhancing the geometric modification of Pt and, therefore, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies, particularly the addition of calcium (Ca), can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Ca modification of the catalyst support impacts several key properties:

1. Acid site reduction: Ca suppresses strong acid sites on the support, which decreases unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

2. Metal-support interactions: Ca accelerates the reduction of promoter metals (e.g., Sn, Ge), leading to increased alloy formation with the active metal (Pt).

3. Electronic properties: Ca modifies the electronic state of Pt, which can affect its catalytic behavior.

4. Dispersion and stability: Ca can increase metal dispersion and prevent sintering, improving catalyst stability.

5. Geometric effects: Enhanced reduction of promoter metals (e.g., GeOx) in Ca-promoted samples leads to greater geometric modification of Pt, reducing its ability to catalyze cracking reactions.

These modifications result in improved catalyst performance, including:

1. Enhanced propylene selectivity
2. Increased catalyst stability
3. Reduced coke formation
4. Suppression of deep dehydrogenation

By carefully tuning the Ca content and other support modification strategies, it is possible to optimize the balance between acidity, metal-support interactions, and geometric/electronic effects to achieve superior catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。可以采用载体改性策略，特别是添加钙（Ca），来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。

Ca对催化剂载体的改性影响几个关键性质：

1. 酸位点减少：Ca抑制载体上的强酸位点，减少不需要的副反应和积炭形成。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：Ca加速促进剂金属（如Sn、Ge）的还原，导致与活性金属（Pt）形成更多合金。

3. 电子性质：Ca修改Pt的电子状态，可能影响其催化行为。

4. 分散性和稳定性：Ca可以增加金属分散度并防止烧结，提高催化剂稳定性。

5. 几何效应：Ca促进的样品中促进剂金属（如GeOx）的增强还原导致Pt的几何修饰更大，减少其催化裂化反应的能力。

这些改性导致催化剂性能改善，包括：

1. 提高丙烯选择性
2. 增加催化剂稳定性
3. 减少积炭形成
4. 抑制深度脱氢

通过仔细调整Ca含量和其他载体改性策略，可以优化酸度、金属-载体相互作用以及几何/电子效应之间的平衡，以在脱氢反应中实现更优越的催化剂性能。
