[1] "Ca suppresses strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[2] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[3] "The promoting effect of Ca on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction was studied using experimental methods and kinetic modeling."

[4] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."

[5] "Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species."

[6] "The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites"

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acid strength of the catalyst support plays a crucial role in determining selectivity and stability. Strong acid sites can promote undesirable side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis, leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

Support modification strategies, particularly the addition of promoters like calcium (Ca), can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Ca suppresses strong acidic sites on the support, which helps reduce side reactions and coke formation. This leads to improved propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

Ca also modifies the electronic properties of the active metal (e.g., Pt) and accelerates the reduction of other promoters (e.g., Sn or Ge). This results in a higher degree of alloy formation between the active metal and promoter, which can further enhance catalyst performance.

The morphological characteristics of the catalyst are also influenced by support modification. Ca addition can affect metal dispersion and particle size, which in turn impacts catalytic activity and selectivity.

Overall, careful tuning of support acidity through promoter addition, along with optimization of metal-support and metal-promoter interactions, can lead to significant improvements in catalyst performance for dehydrogenation reactions. These strategies help balance activity, selectivity, and stability to achieve optimal catalytic efficiency.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。催化剂载体的酸强度在决定选择性和稳定性方面起着至关重要的作用。强酸位点可能促进不良的副反应，如裂解和氢解，导致积碳形成和催化剂失活。

载体改性策略，特别是添加钙（Ca）等促进剂，可以用来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。Ca抑制载体上的强酸位点，有助于减少副反应和积碳形成。这导致丙烯选择性提高和催化剂稳定性增强。

Ca还能修改活性金属（如Pt）的电子性质，并加速其他促进剂（如Sn或Ge）的还原。这导致活性金属和促进剂之间形成更高程度的合金，从而进一步提高催化剂性能。

催化剂的形态特征也受到载体改性的影响。Ca的添加可以影响金属分散度和粒径，从而影响催化活性和选择性。

总的来说，通过添加促进剂仔细调节载体酸度，同时优化金属-载体和金属-促进剂相互作用，可以显著提高脱氢反应的催化剂性能。这些策略有助于平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，以实现最佳的催化效率。
