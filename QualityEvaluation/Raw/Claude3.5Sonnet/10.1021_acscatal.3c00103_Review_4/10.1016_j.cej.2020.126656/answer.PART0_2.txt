[1] "Ca suppresses strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[2] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[3] "Ca decreases acidity, increases Pt dispersion, and prevents sintering of metal particles."

[4] "The fading of the second peak clearly highlights the positive role of Ca in suppressing acidic centres."

[5] "The higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acid strength and stability of the catalyst support play a crucial role in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Strong acid sites on the support can promote undesirable side reactions and coke formation, leading to catalyst deactivation. 

Support modification strategies, particularly the addition of promoters like calcium (Ca), can be employed to optimize these properties. Ca acts to suppress strong acidic sites on the support, which helps reduce coke formation and improves catalyst stability. It also modifies the electronic properties of the active metal (e.g., Pt), which can suppress deep dehydrogenation and facilitate coke desorption.

Furthermore, Ca promotion can enhance the reducibility of other promoter species (e.g., GeOx), leading to a higher degree of alloy formation between the active metal and promoter. This can modify the geometric and electronic properties of the active sites, potentially increasing selectivity towards the desired product.

Morphological characteristics are also important. Ca addition can increase metal dispersion and prevent sintering of metal particles, which helps maintain catalyst activity over time. The modification of support acidity and metal-support interactions can lead to changes in activation energy for both the main reaction and deactivation processes, ultimately affecting the overall catalytic performance.

In summary, carefully tuning the acid-base properties of the support, promoting alloy formation, and optimizing metal dispersion through support modification strategies like Ca addition can significantly enhance catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。催化剂载体的酸强度和稳定性在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。载体上的强酸位点可能促进不需要的副反应和积碳形成，导致催化剂失活。

可以采用载体改性策略，特别是添加钙（Ca）等促进剂，来优化这些性质。Ca的作用是抑制载体上的强酸位点，这有助于减少积碳形成并提高催化剂稳定性。它还可以修饰活性金属（如Pt）的电子性质，这可以抑制深度脱氢并促进积碳脱附。

此外，Ca促进可以增强其他促进剂物种（如GeOx）的可还原性，导致活性金属和促进剂之间形成更高程度的合金。这可以修改活性位点的几何和电子性质，可能增加对目标产物的选择性。

形态特征也很重要。Ca的添加可以增加金属分散度并防止金属颗粒烧结，这有助于长期维持催化剂活性。载体酸度和金属-载体相互作用的修饰可以导致主反应和失活过程的活化能发生变化，最终影响整体催化性能。

总之，通过Ca添加等载体改性策略，仔细调节载体的酸碱性质，促进合金形成，并优化金属分散度，可以显著提高脱氢反应的催化效率、选择性和稳定性。
