The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Specifically, alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite catalysts in alcoholic solutions of alkali metal hydroxides was found to greatly change their acidities, affecting both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, without altering the texture properties of the zeolite. This modification led to improved catalytic performance and resistance to coking in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural.

The study employed various characterization techniques such as XRD, N2 sorption isotherms, FTIR spectroscopy, and XPS analysis to investigate the effects of alkaline treatment on the catalyst structure and properties. These methods revealed how the treatment modified the acid sites and local environments of Zr species in the zeolite.

By carefully controlling the concentration of alkali metal hydroxides used in the treatment, researchers were able to optimize the balance of acid sites, leading to improved catalytic performance. This demonstrates how support modification strategies can be employed to fine-tune catalyst properties for specific reactions, enhancing both efficiency and selectivity.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了如何使用碱性处理作为载体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。

具体而言，研究发现，在碱金属氢氧化物的醇溶液中对Zr-Al-Beta沸石催化剂进行碱性处理，可以显著改变其酸性，影响布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位，而不改变沸石的结构特性。这种改性导致了在糠醛的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley（MPV）还原反应中催化性能的提高和抗积碳能力的增强。

研究采用了各种表征技术，如XRD、N2吸脱附等温线、FTIR光谱和XPS分析，以研究碱性处理对催化剂结构和性质的影响。这些方法揭示了处理如何改变沸石中的酸位和Zr物种的局部环境。

通过仔细控制处理中使用的碱金属氢氧化物的浓度，研究人员能够优化酸位的平衡，从而提高催化性能。这表明载体改性策略可以用于微调催化剂性质以适应特定反应，同时提高效率和选择性。
