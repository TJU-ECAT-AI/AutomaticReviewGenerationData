[1] "The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine)."

[2] "Complementary investigation by HAADF-STEM coupled with EDX analysis, indicates that the zirconium and sodium species are homogeneously distributed over the whole crystals, suggesting high dispersibilities of zirconium and alkali metal"

[3] "This demonstrates that alkali-metal cations could effectively weaken the acidic properties of the open Zr Lewis sites."

[4] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta zeolites, weakening their acidic properties. This modification affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and resistance to carbon deposition.

Support modification strategies employed to optimize these properties include:

1. Alkaline treatment: The introduction of alkali-metal ions (Li, Na, K) to Zr-Al-Beta zeolites modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, weakening their acidity and improving catalytic performance.

2. Controlled concentration of alkaline treatment: An appropriate concentration of alkali metal hydroxide is crucial for optimal modification without damaging the zeolite structure.

3. Homogeneous distribution of active species: HAADF-STEM and EDX analysis show that zirconium and sodium species are well-dispersed throughout the catalyst, enhancing its efficiency.

4. Transformation of acid sites: Alkaline treatment converts some Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites while suppressing overall Lewis acidity, leading to improved selectivity and reduced coke formation.

These strategies result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity towards desired products, and increased resistance to deactivation through carbon deposition. The optimized catalyst shows better performance in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural, demonstrating higher yields of furfuryl alcohol and improved stability over multiple reaction cycles.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了碱性处理如何修饰Zr-Al-Beta沸石中的Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位，减弱其酸性特性。这种修饰影响了催化剂的活性、选择性和抗积碳能力。

用于优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 碱性处理：向Zr-Al-Beta沸石中引入碱金属离子（Li、Na、K），修饰Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位，减弱其酸性并改善催化性能。

2. 控制碱性处理浓度：适当浓度的碱金属氢氧化物对于优化修饰而不破坏沸石结构至关重要。

3. 活性物种的均匀分布：HAADF-STEM和EDX分析表明，锆和钠物种在整个催化剂中均匀分布，提高了其效率。

4. 酸位转化：碱性处理将部分Brønsted酸位转化为Lewis酸位，同时抑制整体Lewis酸性，从而提高选择性并减少积碳形成。

这些策略导致催化效率提高、对目标产物的选择性改善以及通过碳沉积而导致的失活抗性增加。优化后的催化剂在糠醛的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley（MPV）还原中表现出更好的性能，呈现出更高的糠醇产率和多个反应周期的改进稳定性。

[1] "The characterization of textural and acid properties of the processed samples demonstrated that a proper alkaline treatment process could not change the texture properties of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite but greatly change their acidities on not only Brsnsted acid but also Lewis acid."

[2] "Typically, the conversion rate of FUR in the initial reaction period in three catalytic systems follows an order of Li+-Zr-Al-Beta > Na+-Zr-Al-Beta > K+-Zr-Al-Beta (Table 2, entry 46), which is consistent with the order of Lewis acidities of Zr species in M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites (Fig. 2 and 3b-d)."

[3] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

[4] "When MOH concentration is higher than 0.025 M, however, FUR conversion on them begins to decrease with the increasing MOH concentration. Meanwhile, the resultant M/Al molar ratio in M+-Zr-Al-Beta is over 1.0. This indicates that the excessive metal ions are introduced by grafting to deprotonated silanol groups, which will further decrease the Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, even convert them into alkali ones."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can modify their acid properties without changing textural properties. This modification affects both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, leading to improved catalytic performance and reduced carbon deposition.

The strength of Lewis acidity in modified zeolites (M+-Zr-Al-Beta) correlates with their catalytic activity, following the order Li+ > Na+ > K+. This demonstrates how tuning the acid strength through different alkali metal ions can optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Support modification strategies, such as alkaline treatment, can be employed to optimize catalyst properties. The concentration of alkali metal hydroxide used in the treatment is crucial. An optimal concentration (around 0.025 M) can improve catalytic performance, while excessive concentrations can decrease Lewis acidity or even convert the sites to basic ones, reducing catalytic activity.

These modifications not only enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity but also improve the catalyst's resistance to coking, which is essential for maintaining long-term catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，尤其是酸强度和稳定性，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。文献讨论了如何通过碱性处理Zr-Al-Beta沸石来改变其酸性质而不改变织构性质。这种改性影响了布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位，从而提高了催化性能并减少了积碳。

改性沸石（M+-Zr-Al-Beta）的路易斯酸强度与其催化活性相关，遵循Li+ > Na+ > K+的顺序。这表明通过不同的碱金属离子调节酸强度可以优化催化效率和选择性。

可以采用支持体改性策略，如碱性处理，来优化催化剂性质。处理中使用的碱金属氢氧化物浓度至关重要。最佳浓度（约0.025 M）可以提高催化性能，而过高的浓度会降低路易斯酸性，甚至将酸位转变为碱位，从而降低催化活性。

这些改性不仅提高了催化效率和选择性，还提高了催化剂抗积碳能力，这对于在脱氢反应中维持长期催化性能至关重要。

[1] "The incorporation of Zr atom in Al-Beta, FUR conversion on it improves greatly at the same reaction time, but the FPE still is the main product in these reactions"

[2] "Typically, the FUR conversion for Na+-Al-Beta increases to 46.0% from 18.8% of Al-Beta within reaction time of 3 h. Moreover, FAL rather than FPE becomes the primary product; this implies that the Brnsted acid sites in Al-Beta are successfully transformed into weak Lewis acid sites, which can perform the MPV reduction of FUR toward FAL but not further etherification of FAL."

[3] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well. Moreover, the Lewis acidities change with different alkaline ions, and so lead to their different catalytic activities and product selectivity in FUR conversion."

[4] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of Zr atoms into Al-Beta zeolites improves furfural (FUR) conversion, but still produces furfuryl isopropyl ether (FPE) as the main product. 

Alkaline treatment is an effective support modification strategy to optimize catalyst properties for enhanced efficiency and selectivity. This treatment transforms Brønsted acid sites into weak Lewis acid sites, which can perform the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of FUR to furfuryl alcohol (FAL) without further etherification. The type and concentration of alkali metal ions used in the treatment affect the Lewis acidity of the catalyst, leading to different catalytic activities and product selectivities.

Moreover, alkaline treatment reduces carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, improving its stability and reusability. This is attributed to the modification effect of alkali metal ions on both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite.

In summary, optimizing the acid strength and stability of catalysts through support modification strategies like alkaline treatment can significantly enhance their catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. This approach allows for tailoring the catalyst's properties to suit specific reaction requirements.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。将Zr原子引入Al-Beta沸石可以提高糠醛(FUR)的转化率，但仍然以糠醇异丙醚(FPE)为主要产物。

碱性处理是一种有效的载体改性策略，可以优化催化剂性能，提高效率和选择性。这种处理将布朗斯特酸位转化为弱路易斯酸位，可以进行FUR到糠醇(FAL)的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV)还原，而不会进一步醚化。处理中使用的碱金属离子的类型和浓度影响催化剂的路易斯酸性，导致不同的催化活性和产物选择性。

此外，碱性处理减少了催化剂表面的碳沉积，提高了其稳定性和可重复使用性。这归因于碱金属离子对Zr-Al-Beta沸石的布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位的修饰效应。

总之，通过碱性处理等载体改性策略优化催化剂的酸强度和稳定性，可以显著提高其在脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。这种方法允许根据特定反应要求定制催化剂的性能。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, altering their acidities without changing the textural properties. This modification leads to improved catalytic performance, including higher selectivity towards desired products (like furfuryl alcohol) and reduced formation of undesired byproducts (like humins).

The treatment also enhances the catalyst's resistance to carbon deposition, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic efficiency over time. The alkali metal ions introduced during the treatment play a key role in modifying the acid sites, resulting in better overall catalytic performance.

This support modification strategy demonstrates the potential for optimizing zeolite catalysts through careful tuning of their acid properties, leading to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Specifically, alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite catalysts in alcoholic solutions of alkali metal hydroxides was found to greatly change their acidities, affecting both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, without altering the texture properties of the zeolite. This modification led to improved catalytic performance and resistance to coking in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural.

The study employed various characterization techniques such as XRD, N2 sorption isotherms, FTIR spectroscopy, and XPS analysis to investigate the effects of alkaline treatment on the catalyst structure and properties. These methods revealed how the treatment modified the acid sites and local environments of Zr species in the zeolite.

By carefully controlling the concentration of alkali metal hydroxides used in the treatment, researchers were able to optimize the balance of acid sites, leading to improved catalytic performance. This demonstrates how support modification strategies can be employed to fine-tune catalyst properties for specific reactions, enhancing both efficiency and selectivity.
