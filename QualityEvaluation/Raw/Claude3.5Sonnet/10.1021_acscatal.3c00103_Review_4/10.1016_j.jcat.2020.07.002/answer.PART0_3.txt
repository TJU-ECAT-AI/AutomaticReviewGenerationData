[1] "The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine)."

[2] "Alkaline treatment to zeolites was proved possibility of potential application."

[3] "The characterization of textural and acid properties of the processed samples demonstrated that a proper alkaline treatment process could not change the texture properties of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite but greatly change their acidities on not only Brsnted acid but also Lewis acid."

[4] "Its catalytic result in MPV reduction of FUR toward FAL showed that the alkaline treatment greatly promoted selectivity of FAL and significantly decreased the formation of humins during the reaction."

[5] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, altering their acidities without changing the textural properties. This modification leads to improved catalytic performance, including higher selectivity towards desired products (like furfuryl alcohol) and reduced formation of undesired byproducts (like humins).

The treatment also enhances the catalyst's resistance to carbon deposition, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic efficiency over time. The alkali metal ions introduced during the treatment play a key role in modifying the acid sites, resulting in better overall catalytic performance.

This support modification strategy demonstrates the potential for optimizing zeolite catalysts through careful tuning of their acid properties, leading to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。该文献讨论了如何通过碱性处理Zr-Al-Beta沸石来作为一种载体改性策略，以优化这些性质，从而提高催化效率和选择性。

碱性处理修饰了沸石中的Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位，改变了它们的酸性，同时不改变其质地性质。这种修饰导致了催化性能的提高，包括对目标产物（如糠醇）的选择性提高，以及对不良副产物（如腐殖质）形成的减少。

该处理还增强了催化剂抗碳沉积的能力，这对于长期维持催化效率至关重要。在处理过程中引入的碱金属离子在修饰酸位方面起着关键作用，从而导致整体催化性能的提升。

这种载体改性策略展示了通过精心调节沸石催化剂的酸性质，可以优化催化剂，从而在脱氢反应中提高效率和选择性的潜力。
