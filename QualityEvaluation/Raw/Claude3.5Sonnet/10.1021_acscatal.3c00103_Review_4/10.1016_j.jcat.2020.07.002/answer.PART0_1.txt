[1] "The characterization of textural and acid properties of the processed samples demonstrated that a proper alkaline treatment process could not change the texture properties of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite but greatly change their acidities on not only Brsnsted acid but also Lewis acid."

[2] "Typically, the conversion rate of FUR in the initial reaction period in three catalytic systems follows an order of Li+-Zr-Al-Beta > Na+-Zr-Al-Beta > K+-Zr-Al-Beta (Table 2, entry 46), which is consistent with the order of Lewis acidities of Zr species in M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites (Fig. 2 and 3b-d)."

[3] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

[4] "When MOH concentration is higher than 0.025 M, however, FUR conversion on them begins to decrease with the increasing MOH concentration. Meanwhile, the resultant M/Al molar ratio in M+-Zr-Al-Beta is over 1.0. This indicates that the excessive metal ions are introduced by grafting to deprotonated silanol groups, which will further decrease the Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, even convert them into alkali ones."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can modify their acid properties without changing textural properties. This modification affects both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, leading to improved catalytic performance and reduced carbon deposition.

The strength of Lewis acidity in modified zeolites (M+-Zr-Al-Beta) correlates with their catalytic activity, following the order Li+ > Na+ > K+. This demonstrates how tuning the acid strength through different alkali metal ions can optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Support modification strategies, such as alkaline treatment, can be employed to optimize catalyst properties. The concentration of alkali metal hydroxide used in the treatment is crucial. An optimal concentration (around 0.025 M) can improve catalytic performance, while excessive concentrations can decrease Lewis acidity or even convert the sites to basic ones, reducing catalytic activity.

These modifications not only enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity but also improve the catalyst's resistance to coking, which is essential for maintaining long-term catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，尤其是酸强度和稳定性，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。文献讨论了如何通过碱性处理Zr-Al-Beta沸石来改变其酸性质而不改变织构性质。这种改性影响了布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位，从而提高了催化性能并减少了积碳。

改性沸石（M+-Zr-Al-Beta）的路易斯酸强度与其催化活性相关，遵循Li+ > Na+ > K+的顺序。这表明通过不同的碱金属离子调节酸强度可以优化催化效率和选择性。

可以采用支持体改性策略，如碱性处理，来优化催化剂性质。处理中使用的碱金属氢氧化物浓度至关重要。最佳浓度（约0.025 M）可以提高催化性能，而过高的浓度会降低路易斯酸性，甚至将酸位转变为碱位，从而降低催化活性。

这些改性不仅提高了催化效率和选择性，还提高了催化剂抗积碳能力，这对于在脱氢反应中维持长期催化性能至关重要。
