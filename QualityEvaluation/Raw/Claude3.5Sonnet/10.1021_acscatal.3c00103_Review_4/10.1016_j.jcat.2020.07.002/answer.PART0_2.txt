[1] "The incorporation of Zr atom in Al-Beta, FUR conversion on it improves greatly at the same reaction time, but the FPE still is the main product in these reactions"

[2] "Typically, the FUR conversion for Na+-Al-Beta increases to 46.0% from 18.8% of Al-Beta within reaction time of 3 h. Moreover, FAL rather than FPE becomes the primary product; this implies that the Brnsted acid sites in Al-Beta are successfully transformed into weak Lewis acid sites, which can perform the MPV reduction of FUR toward FAL but not further etherification of FAL."

[3] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well. Moreover, the Lewis acidities change with different alkaline ions, and so lead to their different catalytic activities and product selectivity in FUR conversion."

[4] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of Zr atoms into Al-Beta zeolites improves furfural (FUR) conversion, but still produces furfuryl isopropyl ether (FPE) as the main product. 

Alkaline treatment is an effective support modification strategy to optimize catalyst properties for enhanced efficiency and selectivity. This treatment transforms Brønsted acid sites into weak Lewis acid sites, which can perform the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of FUR to furfuryl alcohol (FAL) without further etherification. The type and concentration of alkali metal ions used in the treatment affect the Lewis acidity of the catalyst, leading to different catalytic activities and product selectivities.

Moreover, alkaline treatment reduces carbon deposition on the catalyst surface, improving its stability and reusability. This is attributed to the modification effect of alkali metal ions on both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite.

In summary, optimizing the acid strength and stability of catalysts through support modification strategies like alkaline treatment can significantly enhance their catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. This approach allows for tailoring the catalyst's properties to suit specific reaction requirements.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。将Zr原子引入Al-Beta沸石可以提高糠醛(FUR)的转化率，但仍然以糠醇异丙醚(FPE)为主要产物。

碱性处理是一种有效的载体改性策略，可以优化催化剂性能，提高效率和选择性。这种处理将布朗斯特酸位转化为弱路易斯酸位，可以进行FUR到糠醇(FAL)的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV)还原，而不会进一步醚化。处理中使用的碱金属离子的类型和浓度影响催化剂的路易斯酸性，导致不同的催化活性和产物选择性。

此外，碱性处理减少了催化剂表面的碳沉积，提高了其稳定性和可重复使用性。这归因于碱金属离子对Zr-Al-Beta沸石的布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位的修饰效应。

总之，通过碱性处理等载体改性策略优化催化剂的酸强度和稳定性，可以显著提高其在脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。这种方法允许根据特定反应要求定制催化剂的性能。
