[1] "The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine)."

[2] "Complementary investigation by HAADF-STEM coupled with EDX analysis, indicates that the zirconium and sodium species are homogeneously distributed over the whole crystals, suggesting high dispersibilities of zirconium and alkali metal"

[3] "This demonstrates that alkali-metal cations could effectively weaken the acidic properties of the open Zr Lewis sites."

[4] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well."

[5] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta zeolites, weakening their acidic properties. This modification affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and resistance to carbon deposition.

Support modification strategies employed to optimize these properties include:

1. Alkaline treatment: The introduction of alkali-metal ions (Li, Na, K) to Zr-Al-Beta zeolites modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, weakening their acidity and improving catalytic performance.

2. Controlled concentration of alkaline treatment: An appropriate concentration of alkali metal hydroxide is crucial for optimal modification without damaging the zeolite structure.

3. Homogeneous distribution of active species: HAADF-STEM and EDX analysis show that zirconium and sodium species are well-dispersed throughout the catalyst, enhancing its efficiency.

4. Transformation of acid sites: Alkaline treatment converts some Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites while suppressing overall Lewis acidity, leading to improved selectivity and reduced coke formation.

These strategies result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity towards desired products, and increased resistance to deactivation through carbon deposition. The optimized catalyst shows better performance in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural, demonstrating higher yields of furfuryl alcohol and improved stability over multiple reaction cycles.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了碱性处理如何修饰Zr-Al-Beta沸石中的Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位，减弱其酸性特性。这种修饰影响了催化剂的活性、选择性和抗积碳能力。

用于优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 碱性处理：向Zr-Al-Beta沸石中引入碱金属离子（Li、Na、K），修饰Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位，减弱其酸性并改善催化性能。

2. 控制碱性处理浓度：适当浓度的碱金属氢氧化物对于优化修饰而不破坏沸石结构至关重要。

3. 活性物种的均匀分布：HAADF-STEM和EDX分析表明，锆和钠物种在整个催化剂中均匀分布，提高了其效率。

4. 酸位转化：碱性处理将部分Brønsted酸位转化为Lewis酸位，同时抑制整体Lewis酸性，从而提高选择性并减少积碳形成。

这些策略导致催化效率提高、对目标产物的选择性改善以及通过碳沉积而导致的失活抗性增加。优化后的催化剂在糠醛的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley（MPV）还原中表现出更好的性能，呈现出更高的糠醇产率和多个反应周期的改进稳定性。
