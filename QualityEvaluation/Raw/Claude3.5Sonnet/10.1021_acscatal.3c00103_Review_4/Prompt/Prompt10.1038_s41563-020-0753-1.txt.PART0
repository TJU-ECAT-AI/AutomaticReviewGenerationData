Finned zeolite catalysts
There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption. Producing zeolite crystals with sizes less than 100nm, however, is non-trivial, often requires the use of complex organics and typically results in a small product yield. Here we present an alternative, facile approach to enhance the mass-transport properties of zeolites by the epitaxial growth of fin-like protrusions on seed crystals. We validate this generalizable methodology on two common zeolites and confirm that fins are in crystallographic registry with the underlying seeds, and that secondary growth does not impede access to the micropores. Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin. This approach could be extended to the rational synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials.
Main
The confined channels and cages of microporous materials (zeolites) are utilized in numerous applications, which span from catalysis1,2 and adsorption3 to selective separations4,5. A common objective in the design of zeolitic materials is to overcome the inherent mass-transport limitations of micropores. This is a ubiquitous challenge for the development of zeolite catalysts in which narrow pore apertures and long diffusion path lengths lead to more rapid deactivation owing to the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits (coke)6. This is particularly true for zeolites with low-dimensional pore networks. There is an increasing body of literature that shows how the preparation of nanosized crystals can enhance catalyst lifetime and/or alter product selectivity7,8. For example, the advent of two-dimensional (2D)9,10 or self-pillared11 zeolites with sizes on the order of a crystal unit cell (24nm) exhibit a superior catalytic performance to that of conventional zeolites; however, the preparation of these materials has only been demonstrated for a few framework types. Indeed, only a relatively small number of reported zeolites have crystal sizes less than 100nm (refs. 12,13,14), which highlights the challenges associated with synthesizing nanosized microporous materials. This has motivated the development of alternative methods, such as the preparation of hierarchical zeolites15,16, in which the introduction of mesopores has an analogous beneficial effect on mass transport17,18. The practical challenges of nanosized zeolite synthesis include the customary requirement of unconventional organics and the frequent drawback of small product yields. This underscores the need for more facile, efficient methods to produce nanosized zeolites by methodologies that are generalizable to a broad number of framework types.
One-pot synthesis of finned zeolites
Here we investigate an alternative method to reduce internal diffusion limitations via the synthesis of zeolites with rough protrusions (size α) on their exterior surfaces (Fig. 1a), which exhibit an identical crystallographic registry with the interior crystal (size β). These features resemble fins, which are well-known to enhance the rate of heat transfer in conductive materials owing to the increased external surface area. Analogous to studies by Ryoo and co-workers10, who showed that hierarchical zeolites that possess a high external surface area markedly reduce external coking, we demonstrate a similar effect for finned catalysts, and focus on two common 3D medium-pore zeolites: ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework). The synthesis of ZSM-11 by a previously reported protocol19 yields crystals with relatively smooth exterior surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 1). We identified an alternative one-pot synthesis of ZSM-11 that produces crystals with finned surfaces (Fig. 1b,c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that these are single crystals (Fig. 1d) with an identical registry between the centre of the particle and the exterior fins. These exterior features are aligned in parallel with an average dimension of 35nm (Fig. 1e). Elemental analysis reveals no evidence of aluminium zoning (Supplementary Table 1)20, which has been reported for ZSM-521. Moreover, textural analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2) shows no evidence of mesoporosity in ZSM-11 samples, although TEM tomography reveals the presence of isolated pores within the interior of these particles (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 1), which is probably attributable to the non-classical mechanism of zeolite growth that involves particle attachment22,23.

Prior studies have reported rough crystals of ZSM-1124 and ZSM-525. The majority of these examples are structures with distinctly different features to those reported here. Notably, the rough crystals reported in literature are commonly aggregates with small crystallites arranged in random orientations on the exterior surfaces of larger particles (Supplementary Fig. 4). These misoriented domains can give rise to pore blockage at the interfacial boundaries between adjacent particles; however, prior studies have demonstrated that these aggregated structures enhance the overall catalytic performance relative to that of conventional analogues, which is attributed to the introduction of interstitial mesopores26. Here we show that the one-pot synthesis of finned ZSM-11 improves the catalyst properties owing to a different mechanism: enhanced mass transport through fins of a much smaller dimension (that is, α<<β). Shen et al.19 previously reported trends in catalyst lifetime and selectivity as a function of H-ZSM-11 crystal size (150, 300 and 750nm) using methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) as a model reaction. In Fig. 1f, the time-on-stream (TOS) conversions over these three catalysts are compared with that of the finned H-ZSM-11 sample, which has an overall size of 460nm, fins included. Interestingly, the finned catalyst deviates from the trend of increasing lifetime with decreasing crystal size when comparisons are made on the basis of overall particle dimension; however, the trend is qualitatively consistent if the finned catalyst behaves as a crystal of much smaller size, commensurate with that of the average fin dimension (α35nm).
Preparation of finned zeolites by secondary growth
The preparation of finned zeolite crystals via a one-pot synthesis is arbitrary and difficult to predict owing to the largely unknown impact of synthesis parameters on zeolite crystallization. To this end, secondary (or seeded) growth offers a more controlled method to create fins on the exterior surfaces of seed crystals. Here we demonstrate the secondary growth method for both ZSM-11 (Fig. 2ad) and ZSM-5 (Fig. 2eh). Scanning electron microscopy images of ZSM-11 (Fig. 2a) and ZSM-5 (Fig. 2e) seeds reveal exterior crystal surfaces devoid of rough features. Scanning electron microscopy images after secondary growth of ZSM-11 (Fig. 2b) and ZSM-5 (Fig. 2f) confirm the presence of fins (protrusions). TEM images show average feature sizes of 303nm for ZSM-11 (Fig. 2c) and 536nm for ZSM-5 (Fig. 2g). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 2d,h) also confirm that the samples are single zeolite crystals, which thus indicates that the fins grow epitaxially on the surfaces of the seeds. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that the samples are fully crystalline before and after seeded growth (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6), whereas textural analysis (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7) shows a slight increase in the total surface area (8%) with secondary growth without an appreciable change in micropore volume (as shown in Supplementary Table 3, the micropore volumes for finned and seed particles are indistinguishable). Elemental analysis (Supplementary Table 3) also confirms that the Si/Al ratio of the samples before and after seeded growth are nearly identical.

The protocol to generate finned zeolites (Methods) was strategically selected by adjusting the supersaturation to a level that was sufficiently high to avoid layer-by-layer growth of coreshells (that is, complete overgrowth of seed crystals), which was previously demonstrated by Ghorbanpour et al.27. However, there is an upper limit of supersaturation that, when exceeded, leads to the homogeneous nucleation of new crystals in the growth solution, and thereby generates aggregates of both small and large crystallites. TEM tomography of finned ZSM-11 (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Video 2) and ZSM-5 (Fig. 2j and Supplementary Video 3) after secondary growth confirmed the absence of intraparticle mesoporosity. TEM tomograms of each sample perpendicular to the z direction (z stacks), depicted in Fig. 2i,j at the bottom, middle and top of the particles, clearly show the size and distribution of fins on the exterior surfaces. The finned zeolites prepared by secondary growth (Fig. 2k) comprise regions with two characteristic dimensions: β is the size of the original seed along the principal zone axis of diffusion (that is b directions for MFI and MEL) and α is the average size of the fins. An idealized schematic of finned zeolites (Fig. 2l) shows medium-pore channels that extend from the interior to exterior with an identical registry where the net increase in external surface area is highly dependent on the relative sizes of β and α (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 8).
Impact of fins on catalyst performance
To substantiate the enhanced mass-transport properties of zeolites after secondary growth, we assessed the performance of the acid-exchanged (H-form) seed and finned samples in the MTH reaction at subcomplete methanol conversion (6090%). The acid-site density and the framework Al of each catalyst was quantified (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9) to ensure a consistent weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst. This is qualitatively consistent with the TEM and textural analyses showing the epitaxial growth of fins without a noticeable obstruction of the pores at the finseed boundary. For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime. Moreover, comparison of the product selectivities (Fig. 3c,d) reveals a subtle shift whereby finned zeolites, which seemingly behave as pseudo nanocrystallites of dimension α, promote the olefin-based cycle of the MTH hydrocarbon pool (HCP) mechanism28. Prior studies showed a progressive shift in the preferred cycle (from aromatic to olefin) with decreasing crystal size29. This is clearly evident when the conventional descriptor ethylene/2MBu is compared, which is a ratio of the signature products from the aromatic-based cycle (ethylene) and olefin-based cycle (2MBu, 2-methylbutane and 2-methyl-2-butene). Over the entire range of the methanol conversion, we observed a noticeable reduction in the ethylene/2MBu ratio of finned catalysts (Fig. 3e), which agrees with the expected trend for smaller particles.

MTH reactions were repeated using operando ultravioletvisible light (UVvis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy coupled with online gas chromatography to track the spatiotemporal progression of the formation of hydrocarbon species in the zeolite crystals. It was previously shown30 that a UVvis spectrum obtained during MTH catalysis can be grouped into three distinct regions of wavelengths, which correspond to HCP species as well as to small and large polyaromatics. HCP species are reaction products small enough to diffuse through zeolite pores; small polyaromatics are associated with internal coke, given that their size is sufficiently large to fit within zeolite pores, but too large to diffuse out of the zeolite; and large polyaromatics are attributed to external coke. The UVvis spectra for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3f) reveal equivalent internal coke between seed and finned samples; however, there is a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke for the finned sample, which suggests the presence of external protrusions leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths. A similar trend was observed for H-ZSM-5 samples (Fig. 3g), but with a shorter lifetime owing to the tortuous sinusoidal channels of MFI compared to the straight channels of MEL (Fig. 3a,b, insets). Collectively, these studies indicate that finned catalysts enhance mass-transport properties of the zeolite by suppressing the formation of external coke. This seemingly implies that olefins and small aromatics more readily diffuse through the fins, which leads to reduced residence times of HCP species near the pore mouths.
One advantage of the finned synthesis approach is that it is theoretically applicable to a wide range of framework types. Moreover, this approach can be used to upgrade commercial catalysts via the addition of a secondary growth step. As proof of principle, we performed a seeded growth experiment using a commercial ZSM-5 sample from Zeolyst (CBV5524G, Si/Al=25). Electron micrographs of the as-received H-ZSM-5 reveal a heterogeneous particle size distribution with dimensions that span 100250nm (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 12). Secondary growth of these particles successfully generated finned H-ZSM-5 with α=355nm (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 12). Elemental analysis (Supplementary Table 5) also confirms that the Si/Al ratio of the samples before and after the seeded growth were nearly identical. MTH reactions at complete methanol conversion over as-received and finned catalysts reveal that the latter exhibits longer lifetime (Fig. 3j) with expected trends in product selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 13), analogous to the synthetic seed and finned samples. Note that the preparation of ZSM-5 with a high Al content (Si/Al=1525) and sizes ranging from 2nm (2D materials) to 100nm (commercial samples) is largely inaccessible by conventional synthesis routes; however, the synthesis of finned zeolites offers a unique route to achieve pseudo-crystallites within this largely inaccessible size range.
Mass-transport properties of finned zeolites
To confirm whether finned zeolites exhibit distinct mass-transport properties relative to conventional (seed) zeolites, we performed kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to compare the diffusive behaviour of benzene (a relatively bulky, representative hydrocarbon molecule) in silicalite-1, the siliceous isostructure of ZSM-5, with preset α and β dimensions. The schematic in Fig. 1a, which is not drawn to full scale, is a cross-section of the 3D model used in the KMC simulations in which each square represents a unit cell of silicalite-1 (unit cells that belong to the seed and fins are coloured light and dark blue, respectively). The simulated model contains 107 unit cells. Benzene diffuses through the pore network of silicalite-1 via a series of infrequent hops between favourable adsorption sites in the frameworks straight pores (S), sinusoidal channels (Z) and at their intersections (I) (Fig. 4ac), which can be described by first-order kinetics. The KMC simulations of benzene hopping dynamics in silicalite-1 using rate constants from molecular modelling yield diffusivity estimates (Supplementary Table 6) that are in good agreement with experiment31,32. We used this modelling approach to estimate the diffusion path length r, defined as the total trajectory length of a benzene molecule between first entrance and exit of the zeolite crystal, for seed and finned superstructures created by replication of the periodic MFI unit cell. For a seed crystal (β=500nm), the mean diffusion path length for benzene was r=138nm, which corresponds to a characteristic residence time of τ=1.9×105s (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 7). When the surface was decorated with fins (α=50nm) with a fixed pitch γ of 10nm, we obtained r=58nm and τ=7.9×106s (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 7). This 2.4-fold reduction arises from the comparatively shorter distance, relative to the seed crystal, required for diffusing molecules to enter and exit through the fins. Although the magnitude of the improvement depends on the fin surface density (Supplementary Table 7), KMC simulations show that the finned structures exhibit superior mass-transport characteristics, consistent with experimental observations.

The enhanced mass-transport properties of finned zeolites were further verified using an experimental protocol to assess internal diffusion based on time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In these studies, the purified bulky organic base 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (TMPyr) was used to titrate Brnsted acid sites within zeolite micropores (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 14 for details). Diffusion and adsorption of TMPyr slowly permeated the micropores of H-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-5 over 72hours due to steric hindrance from the methyl groups33. The temporal permeation of TMPyr was quantified by the disappearance of FTIR intensity at 3,605cm1 which corresponds to the vacant Brnsted acid sites and also by the appearance of peaks at 1,565cm1 associated with the trimethylpyridinium ion (Supplementary Fig. 15). The loss of Brnsted acid sites is linearly correlated to the increase in trimethylpyridinium ions (Supplementary Fig. 16). The distinct TMPyr uptake kinetics for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 4e) and H-ZSM-5 (Supplementary Fig. 17), both with and without fins, are described by an exponential diffusion model. When the differential of the titrated Brnsted acid sites over time was plotted for the Zeolyst samples (Fig. 4f) and other zeolites (Supplementary Fig. 18), we observed the two distinct diffusion regimes, which indicates the initial fast uptake of TMPyr in the fins relative to the bulk particle. To further assert the correspondence of the two timescales to the finned and bulk portions of the crystals, we also applied the method to examine a self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite, which consists of intergrown few-nanometre-thick MFI nanosheets (that is, it has a uniform micro- and mesopore hierarchical structure throughout each particle), and as such it should exhibit only one (fast) timescale. Indeed, we obtained one diffusion regime, albeit somewhat slower than the fast one obtained in the finned samples, which indicates possible contributions of mesopore resistances in the SPP zeolite (Fig. 4f). Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed that TMPyr is of sufficient size to fit within the channels of both MEL (Fig. 4g) and MFI (Supplementary Fig. 19) frameworks (see Supplementary Note 3 for more details).
Experimental points in TMPyr titration curves (see Supplementary Fig. 20 for details) were fitted using an exponential model (see Supplementary Note 2 for additional details) to obtain time constants for fast (τfast) and slow (τ) diffusion within the finned and interior micropore regions, respectively (Table 1). The finned zeolites exhibit an initial rapid uptake kinetics three orders of magnitude faster than the seed. These trends are qualitatively consistent with KMC models and catalytic studies, which show distinct transport properties of finned zeolites in which the introduction of protrusions with size α<<β markedly reduced the internal diffusion limitations. Time-resolved titration measurements also reveal that this disparity in time constants is maintained for nanocrystals in which the differences between α and β are less substantial (for example, Zeolyst H-ZSM-5 in Fig. 3h,i).

There are few synthesis methods capable of producing ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 crystal sizes in the range 1080nm. Conversely, methods to produce 2D crystals with sizes <10nm often result in insufficient acid-site density (for example, Si/Al>40) for industrial hydrocarbon catalysis. Moreover, ultrasmall crystallite sizes pose practical challenges for solids extraction in commercial synthesis processes. The generation of finned zeolites overcome these restrictions and challenges by altering the performance of large crystals to behave as pseudo-nanocrystals. Using a synergistic combination of state-of-the-art experimental techniques, we show that finned ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites possess unusually outstanding mass-transport properties. Markedly enhanced rates of molecular uptake in fins, coupled with reduced internal diffusion path lengths, leads to less coke formation on external surfaces, longer catalyst lifetimes and a shift in the product selectivities that are characteristic of zeolites with an overall crystal size equal to that of the average fin dimension. The ability to introduce fins through a facile secondary growth process is an alternative method to reduce diffusion limitations in zeolites. Here we demonstrate that this approach can be used to enhance the performance of commercial catalysts, with the promise of becoming a generalized platform for the rational design of zeolites across a broad range of framework types.
Methods
Seed-directed synthesis of finned ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 crystals
The ZSM-11 sample used as seeds was prepared with a molar composition of 10DAO (1,8-diaminooctane):10K2O:100SiO2:1Al2O3:4,000H2O. In a typical synthesis, 0.185g of Al2(SO4)3 was added to a mixture of 0.61g of KOH solution (50wt%) and 15.35g of deionized water. To this solution was added 0.40g of DAO, followed by 5.45g of colloidal silica (LUDOX AS-30) and 0.22g of calcined ZSM-11 crystals (2wt%) according to the procedures outlined in a previous paper34. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24h. The sol gel was then placed in a 60ml Teflon-lined acid digestion bomb and heated in an oven at 160C and autogenous pressure for 3 days. The crystalline product was removed from the mother liquor by three cycles of centrifugation and washes with deionized water, using a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E centrifuge at 5 C and 13,000 rpm for 10 min per cycle. The resulting seeds were immediately stored in deionized water without allowing time for the solids to dry. A seeded growth solution was made with a molar composition of 27.3DAO:11.9K2O:90SiO2:0.5Al2O3:3,588H2O. The solution was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of Al2(SO4)3 to a solution that contained KOH and deionized water, followed by the addition of DAO and LUDOX AS-30. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24h prior to adding 0.65g of as-synthesized ZSM-11 seeds (10wt% relative to the total amount of growth solution). The seeds were not calcined and contained occluded DAO. The suspension was heated for 2days at 120C. The solids were extracted from the mother liquor using the centrifuge/washing procedure described above. ZSM-5 seeds and finned samples were prepared by a similar protocol (see Supplementary Information for details).
Characterization
The H-forms of the zeolite materials were characterized by powder XRD using a Rigaku SmartLab Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation to verify the crystalline structure. Powder XRD patterns were compared to simulated patterns of each framework type provided by the International Zeolite Association Structure Database35. Textural analysis of the H-form samples prepared for catalytic testing was performed by N2 adsorption/desorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The data were analysed by instrument software to obtain the BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area and the microporous volume was determined from the t-plot method.
TEM images and SAED patterns were taken with a JEOL JEM-2100 FEG TEM operated at an accelerating voltage of 200kV. A Gatan Ultrascan CCD (charge-coupled device) camera was used to collect image data and a Gatan Orius 200D CCD detector was used to collect diffraction data. Sample particles were dispersed and ultrasonicated in ethanol and then dipped on a lacey carbon copper grid. Electron tomography was also performed using the JEOL JEM-2100 FEG. A Gatan 912 ultrahigh tilt tomography sample holder was used to achieve a large tilt range. A tilt series of bright-field TEM images of a zeolite crystal particle was acquired over an angular range from 65 to +65. The interval between neighbouring images was kept at 1.0. Before the sample was placed on the copper grid, a droplet of a 5nm gold nanoparticle dispersion was also delivered onto the copper grid as a fiducial marker for tomogram alignment. The software ETomo was used for tilt series data processing, which included alignment and reconstruction.
MTH reactions
The MTH reaction was carried out according to a previously reported procedure19 using a fixed-bed stainless-steel reactor (inner diameter=1/4inch (6.35mm)), H-form zeolite catalysts and a reaction temperature of 350C (Thermo Scientific Lindberg Blue M furnace). The catalysts were pressed and sieved (4060 mesh) and then homogeneously mixed with a diluent (silica gel, 3560 mesh; Sigma-Aldrich). Two plugs of quartz wool were used to support the catalyst bed and the reaction temperature was monitored by a K-type thermocouple (Omega Engineering) inserted into the stainless-steel tube. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst bed was activated in situ at 550C for 3h under a flow of dried air and then cooled to 350C. Methanol (99.9% purity) was continuously fed into the reactor at a WHSV of 9h1 by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) at 7μlmin1 with a preheated inert gas stream of argon (30cm3min1). The effluent was analysed by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent GC7890A) equipped with a flame ionization detector. To compare the deactivation rate of the catalysts, reactions were carried out at a subcomplete methanol conversion, X, with the initial conversion regulated by adjusting the catalyst mass. Methanol conversion is defined as:
$$X = \left[ {1 - \left( {\frac{{C_{{\rm{eff}}}}}{{C_{{\rm{feed}}}}}} \right)} \right] \times 100\%$$ (1)
where Ceff is the carbon-based molar concentration of both methanol and dimethyl ether measured in the effluent and Cfeed is the concentration of methanol measured in the feed. The selectivity, Si, of hydrocarbon product i is defined as:
$$S_i = \left( {\frac{{C_i}}{{C_{{\rm{t}},{\rm{eff}}}}}} \right) \times 100\%$$ (2)
where Ci is the carbon-based molar concentration of hydrocarbon i measured in the effluent and Ct,eff is the total carbon-based molar concentration of hydrocarbons measured in the effluent.
Operando UVvis diffuse reflectance microscopy
The reaction intermediates and coke species formed during the MTH reactions were monitored by operando UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using an AvaSpec 2048L spectrometer36,37. The UVvis spectra were collected in the wavelength range 2001,000nm (11,00050,000cm1 in wavenumber) in reflection mode using a high-temperature UVvis optical fibre probe (Avantes). The probe was placed in a stainless-steel protection sleeve and comprised one excitation and one collection optical fibre with a diameter of 400 μm and a length of 1.5m. Typically, catalysts with the same pellet size to the performance testing were loaded in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (inner diameter=6mm×3mm) and activated at 550C for 3h under 100% oxygen and then cooled to 350C (for the reaction) under a flow of helium. A WHSV of 20h1 was obtained for methanol by flowing helium gas through a methanol saturator at 25C. UVvis spectra were collected and saved every 30s with 100 accumulations.
FTIR spectroscopy
Time-resolved spectra were measured using a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR with a HeNe laser and RT-DLaTGS detector (20kHz scanner velocity, 6mm aperture and KBr beam splitter). For the sample preparation, 15mg of a powder catalyst sample was homogenized using an agate mortar and pestle, pressed at 23ton (CrushIR Digital Hydraulic Press; Pike Technologies) for 5min into 13-mm-diameter pellets (KBR Die, CAS no. 7758-02-3; International Crystal Laboratories) and inserted into the cell body (high temperature cell, Part no. HTC-M-05, CaF2 windows; Harrick Scientific). Before inserting the sample pellet, a background spectrum was collected (64 scans at 4cm1 resolution) with the empty cell. A K-type thermocouple (Part no. 008144; Harrick Scientific) was in constant intimate contact with the sample pellet holder. The manufacturer-provided cartridge heater (100W, 24V) was controlled via a temperature controller in cascade mode (Omega CN7800). To ensure that the CaF2 windows of the sample cell do not overheat, cooling water was continuously pumped (variable flow chemical pump; Control Company) and flowed through water-cooling ports connected to the cell body. The sample was calcined at 500C for 4h in air (Air Ultra Zero; Linde) at a ramp rate of 5Cmin1. After calcination, the sample was cooled down to and remained at 150C for the duration of the experiment to ensure the absence of water. For the amine purification, H-ZSM-5 (CBV28014; Zeolyst International) was calcined under flowing air at 550C for 10h at a ramp rate of 1Cmin1. Freshly calcined H-ZSM-5 was added to 20ml of TMPyr and stirred vigorously (1,200r.p.m.) for >1h. H-ZSM-5 was isolated from TMPyr via centrifugation at 10,000r.p.m. for >5min. TMPyr was used immediately postpurification for dosing in FTIR. For the amine dosing process, He gas was flowed over the sample pellet to purge any remaining air. To ensure that the He was moisture-free, He gas was flowed through a liquid nitrogen trap and desiccator before reaching the cell body. The initial spectrum of the calcined catalyst was measured at this time, with the background spectrum subtracted. Purified TMPyr was flowed at 0.06mlh1 to the sample cell. FTIR spectra (64 scans, 4cm1 resolution and scan range from 4,000 to 1,000cm1) were saved continuously at different time intervals during the duration of the experiment: every 30s for the first 10min, then every 30min for the rest of the experiment.
KMC simulations
KMC simulations were performed to study the transport of benzene through seed and finned silicalite-1 crystals at 300K. Benzene transport in silicalite-1 was characterized by infrequent jumps between three types of favourable adsorption sites located in S, Z and I of the pores (Fig. 4ac). This hopping process was modelled using first-order kinetic equations solved stochastically using the rejection-free KMC algorithm described by Lalou et al.38. The rate constants for the elementary transitions between adsorption sites (Supplementary Table 6) were derived in a previous atomistic simulation study using rare-event sampling methods, in which they were shown to lead to good predictions of benzenes experimentally measured diffusivity31,39.
The seed and finned zeolite crystals were created by replication of the orthorhombic (Pnma) unit cell of MFI, which has unit-cell dimensions of a=2.01nm, b=1.99nm and c=1.34nm along its three principal crystallographic axes. The seed crystal was generated by replicating the unit cell to create a nearly cubic 247×250×372 (496.47×497.50×498.48nm3) supercell with linear dimensions of about β=500nm in each direction (Fig. 1a). The finned crystal was generated by decorating the surface of the smooth structure with smaller, nearly cubic 24×25×37 (48.24×49.750×49.58nm3) supercells with linear dimensions of α=50nm in each direction; the fin location on the surface was chosen to ensure continuity of the pore network. As prescribed by the KMC model, the pore networks of both crystals were represented as lattices with S, Z, and I adsorption sites (Fig. 4ac). On the order of 108 and 109 lattice sites were needed to represent the seed and finned structures, respectively, examined in this study.
Mass transport through the seed and finned zeolite crystals was characterized by computing the diffusion path length for benzene:
$${{r}} = \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_{i = 1}{n - 1} {\left {\Delta {\bf{r}}_i} \right}$$ (3)
where \(\left {\Delta {\bf{r}}_i} \right = \left {{\bf{r}}_i - {\bf{r}}_{i - 1}} \right\)is the scalar distance travelled in the ith KMC step and ri is the position vector of the molecule. The initial position r0 at time t0=0 was chosen by placing benzene at a randomly selected lattice site on the outside of the crystals bounding surface. The KMC moves were attempted and rejected until the molecule first crossed the bounding surface of the crystal to enter at position r1 and time t1. The trajectory of the molecule was then propagated for n KMC steps, with the nth step corresponding to the event in which the molecule first exited the zeolite crystal by recrossing the bounding surface. The residence time within the crystal was calculated as τ=tn1t1. For each structure, the mean diffusion path length r and residence time τ were estimated by averaging over 105 independent trajectories. In each case, only a single benzene molecule was simulated inside the crystal such that interactions between diffusing species could be neglected.
Simulations were performed for several models with different surface-to-surface fin spacing γ, ranging from 4 to 50nm to vary the surface density of fins from 3.27×104 to 1.01×104nm2 (Supplementary Table 7). The mean diffusion path length r and residence time τ decrease monotonically as the surface density of the fins increases. For the models examined, these metrics were reduced by a factor that ranged from 1.5 to 2.5, and thereby demonstrated that the mass-transport characteristics of the finned crystals were enhanced relative to those of the seed zeolites for a broad range of fin densities.
