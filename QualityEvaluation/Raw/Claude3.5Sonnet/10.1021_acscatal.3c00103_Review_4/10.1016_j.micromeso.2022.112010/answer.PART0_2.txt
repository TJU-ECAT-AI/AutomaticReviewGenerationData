[1] "NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity."

[2] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

[3] "Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role. For instance, NaCl is used to suppress zeolite acidity, which affects the catalytic behavior. Morphological characteristics, particularly the dispersion of the active metal (Pt in this case), are also critical. Better Pt dispersion leads to improved catalytic performance.

Several support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties:

1. Using NaCl as a promoter: This enhances Pt dispersion and prevents sintering during calcination.

2. Controlling acid site concentrations: High external surface acid site concentrations contribute to improved catalyst performance.

3. Optimizing Na/Pt atomic ratios: A ratio of 4070 is mentioned as beneficial.

4. Adjusting calcination temperatures: Temperatures between 400-500°C are recommended.

5. Post-calcination washing: This increases catalyst activity and stability by redispersing water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.

6. Controlling the order of component introduction: Calcining excess NaCl and Pt precursor jointly improves Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the physicochemical properties of the catalyst.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性，起着关键作用。例如，使用NaCl来抑制沸石的酸性，这影响了催化行为。形态特征，特别是活性金属（在本例中为Pt）的分散度，也至关重要。更好的Pt分散度会导致更好的催化性能。

可以采用几种支持物修饰策略来优化这些性质：

1. 使用NaCl作为促进剂：这可以增强Pt的分散度并防止在焙烧过程中烧结。

2. 控制酸位浓度：高外表面酸位浓度有助于提高催化剂性能。

3. 优化Na/Pt原子比：提到4070的比例是有益的。

4. 调整焙烧温度：建议温度在400-500°C之间。

5. 焙烧后洗涤：通过重新分散水溶性氯化铂化合物，增加催化剂活性和稳定性。

6. 控制组分引入顺序：共同焙烧过量的NaCl和Pt前体可以改善Pt分散度和催化剂稳定性。

这些策略旨在通过优化催化剂的物理化学性质来提高催化效率和选择性。
