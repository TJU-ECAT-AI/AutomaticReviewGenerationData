[2] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role. The literature mentions that NaCl effectively suppresses zeolite acidity, which is an important factor in catalyst performance. 

Morphological characteristics, particularly the dispersion of the active metal (in this case, Pt), are also critical. The study shows that NaCl promotes Pt dispersion and prevents sintering during calcination, which enhances catalytic properties.

Several support modification strategies are described to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

1. Using NaCl as a promoter: This improves Pt dispersion and prevents sintering.
2. Controlling Na/Pt atomic ratios: The study suggests a ratio of 4070 for improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.
3. Optimizing calcination temperatures: Temperatures of 400-500°C are recommended.
4. Washing with water after calcination: This increases catalyst activity and stability by redispersing water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.
5. Controlling the order of component introduction: Calcining excess NaCl and Pt precursor jointly contributes to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.
6. Maintaining high external surface acid site concentrations: This contributes to improved catalyst performance.

These strategies collectively contribute to optimizing the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, resulting in enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性，起着至关重要的作用。文献提到NaCl有效抑制了沸石的酸性，这是影响催化剂性能的一个重要因素。

形态特征，特别是活性金属（在本例中为Pt）的分散度，也至关重要。研究表明，NaCl促进了Pt的分散并防止了在焙烧过程中的烧结，从而增强了催化性能。

研究描述了几种支持体改性策略，以优化这些性质，从而提高催化效率和选择性：

1. 使用NaCl作为促进剂：这改善了Pt的分散并防止烧结。
2. 控制Na/Pt原子比：研究建议比例为4070，以改善Pt分散和催化剂稳定性。
3. 优化焙烧温度：建议温度为400-500°C。
4. 焙烧后用水洗涤：这通过重新分散水溶性氯化Pt化合物来增加催化剂活性和稳定性。
5. 控制组分引入顺序：共同焙烧过量的NaCl和Pt前体有助于改善Pt分散和催化剂稳定性。
6. 保持高外表面酸位浓度：这有助于改善催化剂性能。

这些策略共同作用，优化了催化剂的物理化学性质，从而在脱氢反应中实现了更高的催化效率和选择性。
