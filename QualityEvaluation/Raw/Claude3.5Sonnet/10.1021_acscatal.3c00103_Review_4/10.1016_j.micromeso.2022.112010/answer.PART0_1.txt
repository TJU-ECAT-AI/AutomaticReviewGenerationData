[1] "NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity."

[2] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

[3] "Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role. For instance, NaCl effectively suppresses zeolite acidity, which can impact the catalyst's behavior. Morphological characteristics, particularly the dispersion of platinum, are also important. 

Several support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

1. Using NaCl as a promoter to improve Pt dispersion and prevent sintering during calcination.
2. Controlling the Na/Pt atomic ratio (around 4070) to enhance Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.
3. Optimizing calcination temperatures (400-500°C) to improve catalyst properties.
4. Employing a washing step after calcination to increase catalyst activity and stability through redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.
5. Carefully controlling the order of component introduction, specifically calcining excess NaCl and Pt precursor together.
6. Maintaining high external surface acid site concentrations.

These strategies contribute to improved Pt dispersion and overall catalyst stability, which are crucial for enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性，起着至关重要的作用。例如，氯化钠能有效抑制沸石的酸性，这可能影响催化剂的行为。形态特征，特别是铂的分散度，也同样重要。

可以采用几种载体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性：

1. 使用氯化钠作为助剂来改善铂的分散度并防止在煅烧过程中的烧结。
2. 控制钠/铂原子比（约为4070）以增强铂的分散度和催化剂稳定性。
3. 优化煅烧温度（400-500°C）以改善催化剂性能。
4. 在煅烧后采用洗涤步骤，通过水溶性氯化铂化合物的再分散来提高催化剂活性和稳定性。
5. 仔细控制组分引入顺序，特别是将过量的氯化钠和铂前驱体一起煅烧。
6. 保持高的外表面酸位浓度。

这些策略有助于改善铂的分散度和催化剂的整体稳定性，这对于提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性至关重要。
