The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature suggests that NaCl plays a crucial role in promoting Pt dispersion and preventing sintering during calcination, while also suppressing zeolite acidity. These factors contribute to improved catalyst performance.

Several support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

1. Using NaCl as a promoter: The addition of NaCl helps improve Pt dispersion and prevent sintering during calcination.

2. Controlling acid site concentrations: High external surface acid site concentrations contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

3. Optimizing Na/Pt atomic ratios: The study mentions a Na/Pt atomic ratio of 4070 as beneficial for catalyst performance.

4. Adjusting calcination temperatures: Calcination temperatures of 400-500°C are reported to contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

5. Washing with water: Post-calcination washing increases catalyst activity and stability by redispersing water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.

6. Controlling the order of component introduction: Calcining excess NaCl and the Pt precursor jointly contributes to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

These strategies collectively aim to optimize the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, enhancing its performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。文献表明，氯化钠在促进铂分散和防止焙烧过程中烧结方面起着关键作用，同时还抑制了沸石的酸性。这些因素有助于提高催化剂的性能。

可以采用几种支撑体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性：

1. 使用氯化钠作为促进剂：添加氯化钠有助于改善铂的分散性并防止焙烧过程中的烧结。

2. 控制酸位浓度：高外表面酸位浓度有助于改善铂的分散性和催化剂的稳定性。

3. 优化钠/铂原子比：研究提到4070的钠/铂原子比对催化剂性能有利。

4. 调整焙烧温度：400-500°C的焙烧温度据报道有助于改善铂的分散性和催化剂的稳定性。

5. 用水洗涤：焙烧后的洗涤通过重新分散水溶性氯化铂化合物来增加催化剂的活性和稳定性。

6. 控制组分引入顺序：共同焙烧过量的氯化钠和铂前体有助于改善铂的分散性和催化剂的稳定性。

这些策略共同旨在优化催化剂的物理化学性质，从而提高其在脱氢反应中的性能。
