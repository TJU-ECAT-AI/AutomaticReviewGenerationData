The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature highlights that NaCl plays a crucial role in promoting Pt dispersion and preventing sintering during calcination, while also effectively suppressing zeolite acidity. These factors contribute to improved catalyst performance.

Several support modification strategies are mentioned to optimize catalyst properties:

1. Using high external surface acid site concentrations
2. Maintaining Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070
3. Applying calcination temperatures of 400-500°C
4. Washing with water after calcination
5. Introducing excess NaCl and Pt precursor together during calcination

These strategies contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability. Additionally, washing after calcination of Pt-containing catalysts increases catalyst activity and stability by redispersing water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss selectivity, the improved dispersion and stability of the catalyst likely contribute to enhanced catalytic efficiency in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献强调，NaCl在促进Pt分散和防止焙烧过程中烧结方面起着关键作用，同时还能有效抑制沸石的酸性。这些因素有助于提高催化剂的性能。

文献提到了几种优化催化剂性质的载体改性策略：

1. 使用高外表面酸性位点浓度
2. 保持Na/Pt原子比为4070
3. 应用400-500°C的焙烧温度
4. 焙烧后用水洗涤
5. 在焙烧过程中同时引入过量的NaCl和Pt前驱体

这些策略有助于改善Pt分散和催化剂稳定性。此外，含Pt催化剂焙烧后的洗涤通过重新分散水溶性氯化Pt化合物，增加了催化剂的活性和稳定性。

虽然文献没有明确讨论选择性，但催化剂分散性和稳定性的改善可能有助于提高丙烷脱氢反应的催化效率。
