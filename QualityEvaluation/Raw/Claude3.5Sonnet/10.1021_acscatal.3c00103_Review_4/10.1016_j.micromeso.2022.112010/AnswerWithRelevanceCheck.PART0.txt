          [1] "NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity."

          [2] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

          [3] "Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. NaCl plays a crucial role in promoting Pt dispersion, preventing sintering during calcination, and suppressing zeolite acidity, which are important factors affecting catalyst performance.

          Several support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

          1. Using NaCl as a promoter to improve Pt dispersion and prevent sintering.
          2. Controlling the Na/Pt atomic ratio (around 4070) to enhance Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.
          3. Optimizing calcination temperatures (400-500°C) to improve catalyst properties.
          4. Employing a washing step after calcination to increase catalyst activity and stability through redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.
          5. Carefully controlling the order of component introduction, specifically calcining excess NaCl and Pt precursor together.
          6. Maintaining high external surface acid site concentrations.

          These strategies collectively aim to optimize the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, enhancing its performance in dehydrogenation reactions by improving Pt dispersion, catalyst stability, and overall catalytic efficiency.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。氯化钠在促进铂分散、防止焙烧过程中烧结以及抑制沸石酸性方面起着关键作用，这些都是影响催化剂性能的重要因素。

          可以采用几种载体改性策略来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性：

          1. 使用氯化钠作为促进剂来改善铂的分散度并防止烧结。
          2. 控制钠/铂原子比（约为4070）以增强铂的分散度和催化剂稳定性。
          3. 优化煅烧温度（400-500°C）以改善催化剂性能。
          4. 在煅烧后采用洗涤步骤，通过水溶性氯化铂化合物的再分散来提高催化剂活性和稳定性。
          5. 仔细控制组分引入顺序，特别是将过量的氯化钠和铂前驱体一起煅烧。
          6. 保持高的外表面酸位浓度。

          这些策略共同旨在优化催化剂的物理化学性质，通过改善铂的分散度、催化剂的稳定性和整体催化效率，来提高其在脱氢反应中的性能。
