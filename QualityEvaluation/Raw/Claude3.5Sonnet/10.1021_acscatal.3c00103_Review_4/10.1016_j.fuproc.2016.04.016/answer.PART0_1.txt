[1] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation. The influence of tin on platinum performance can be electronic or geometric."

[2] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[3] "Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

[4] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially."

[5] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Reducing acid strength by titrating acidic sites with alkali on alumina supports minimizes undesired side reactions like cracking and coking. Using less acidic supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates can eliminate the need for alkali titration.

- Stability: Promoting platinum with tin improves its stability for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area and porosity: Microporous zeolites provide structurally defined frameworks that allow for better understanding of properties-performance correlations.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Promoter addition: Adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances performance through electronic or geometric effects.

- Impregnation technique: Co-impregnation of platinum and tin precursors results in greater interaction compared to sequential impregnation.

- Support material selection: Using less acidic supports or titrating acidic sites on alumina helps optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

- Framework modification: Employing zeolites as supports allows for more precise control and understanding of catalyst properties.

These strategies can be employed to tailor the physicochemical properties of catalysts, optimizing their performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度：通过用碱滴定氧化铝载体上的酸性位点来降低酸强度，可以最大程度地减少不良的副反应，如裂化和结焦。使用锌和镁铝酸盐等酸性较弱的载体可以消除碱滴定的需要。

- 稳定性：用锡促进铂可以提高其在烷烃脱氢中的稳定性。

2. 形态特征：
- 比表面积和孔隙率：微孔沸石提供了结构明确的框架，有助于更好地理解性能与性质之间的关系。

3. 载体改性策略：
- 添加促进剂：向铂催化剂中添加锡可通过电子或几何效应增强性能。

- 浸渍技术：铂和锡前体的共浸渍比顺序浸渍产生更强的相互作用。

- 载体材料选择：使用酸性较弱的载体或滴定氧化铝上的酸性位点有助于优化催化效率和选择性。

- 框架改性：使用沸石作为载体可以更精确地控制和理解催化剂性质。

这些策略可用于调整催化剂的物理化学性质，优化其在脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性等性能。
