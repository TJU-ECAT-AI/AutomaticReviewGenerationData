[1] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "VMgO systems have attracted special attention because of their relatively high selectivity and propene yield. Performances of VMgO for the ODH of propane are enhanced when promoted with redox metal ion(s). Propene selectivity of VMgO increase when promoted with alkali ions, but at the cost of a decline in activity."

[3] "Catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with increasing VOx (isolated monovanadates or polyvanadate) surface density until there is monolayer coverage of the support. Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds"

[5] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity. Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al., reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Eliminating proton sites in zeolites is crucial for achieving high alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. This suggests that reducing acidity can improve selectivity.

2. Chemical composition: VMgO systems show high selectivity and propene yield. Promotion with redox metal ions enhances performance, while alkali ion promotion increases selectivity at the cost of activity.

3. Surface density and dispersion: Catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with VOx surface density up to monolayer coverage. This indicates the importance of optimizing metal loading.

4. Coordination environment: VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than connected V sites.

5. Support modification: Modifying Al2O3 with MgO for VOx catalysts increases propene selectivity. VOx/MgAl2O4 shows improved selectivity compared to VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Using mesoporous supports to increase surface area and space-time yields.
2. Modifying supports with alkaline earth oxides (e.g., MgO) to enhance selectivity.
3. Controlling metal loading to achieve optimal surface density and dispersion.
4. Tailoring the support composition to influence the coordination environment of active sites.
5. Incorporating promoters (e.g., redox metal ions or alkali ions) to fine-tune catalytic properties.

These strategies aim to balance activity and selectivity by optimizing the acid-base properties, metal-support interactions, and active site structures of the catalysts.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸度：消除沸石中的质子位点对于获得高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性至关重要。这表明降低酸度可以提高选择性。

2. 化学成分：VMgO系统显示出高选择性和丙烯产率。通过氧化还原金属离子促进可以提高性能，而碱金属离子促进可以增加选择性，但会降低活性。

3. 表面密度和分散性：负载型钒氧化物催化剂的催化活性随VOx表面密度增加而增加，直至单层覆盖。这表明优化金属负载量很重要。

4. 配位环境：具有四个以上氧配体的VOx位点比四面体VO4物种更活跃但选择性较低。孤立的VOx位点选择性高但活性低于通过VOV键连接的V位点。

5. 载体改性：用MgO改性Al2O3作为VOx催化剂的载体可以提高丙烯选择性。VOx/MgAl2O4比VOx/Al2O3和MgO改性的VOx/Al2O3显示出更高的选择性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 使用介孔载体以增加表面积和空间时间产率。
2. 用碱土金属氧化物（如MgO）改性载体以提高选择性。
3. 控制金属负载量以达到最佳表面密度和分散度。
4. 调整载体组成以影响活性位点的配位环境。
5. 引入助剂（如氧化还原金属离子或碱金属离子）以微调催化性能。

这些策略旨在通过优化催化剂的酸碱性质、金属-载体相互作用和活性位点结构来平衡活性和选择性。
