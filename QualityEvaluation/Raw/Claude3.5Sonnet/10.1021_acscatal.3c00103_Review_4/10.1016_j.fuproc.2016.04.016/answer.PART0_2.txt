[1] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."

[2] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[3] "Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

[4] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali ions has been shown to increase propene selectivity but at the expense of a decrease in propane conversion due to lower reducibility of the VOx or MoOx domain"

[5] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities like acid strength and stability play a crucial role. For instance, the acidity of the support material can lead to undesired side reactions such as cracking and coking. To address this, various support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Titration of acidic sites: For alumina supports, titrating acidic sites with alkali minimizes unwanted acid-catalyzed reactions, improving selectivity towards the desired products.

2. Use of less acidic supports: Zinc and magnesium aluminates are gaining popularity as they inherently have lower acidity and don't require additional alkali titration.

3. Alkali ion addition: Adding alkali ions to the support can increase selectivity (e.g., propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation), though it may decrease conversion rates due to reduced reducibility of the active metal oxides.

4. Support material combinations: Modifying supports with other oxides (e.g., MgO on Al2O3) can enhance selectivity in certain reactions.

5. Controlling metal-support interactions: The nature and interaction of the active metal (e.g., vanadium) with the support material influences the structure of the active sites, which in turn affects catalytic performance.

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between activity and selectivity by tailoring the acid-base properties, metal-support interactions, and overall surface chemistry of the catalyst. The goal is to create an environment that favors the desired dehydrogenation reaction while minimizing side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性起着关键作用。例如，载体材料的酸性可能导致不希望的副反应，如裂解和结焦。为解决这个问题，可以采用各种载体改性策略：

1. 酸性位点的滴定：对于氧化铝载体，用碱滴定酸性位点可以最大限度地减少不必要的酸催化反应，提高对目标产物的选择性。

2. 使用低酸性载体：锌和镁铝酸盐正在变得流行，因为它们本身具有较低的酸性，不需要额外的碱滴定。

3. 添加碱金属离子：向载体添加碱金属离子可以提高选择性（例如，在氧化脱氢中的丙烯选择性），但可能由于活性金属氧化物的可还原性降低而降低转化率。

4. 载体材料组合：用其他氧化物改性载体（例如，在Al2O3上添加MgO）可以在某些反应中提高选择性。

5. 控制金属-载体相互作用：活性金属（如钒）与载体材料的性质和相互作用影响活性位点的结构，进而影响催化性能。

这些策略旨在通过调整催化剂的酸碱性质、金属-载体相互作用和整体表面化学性质，优化活性和选择性之间的平衡。目标是创造一个有利于所需脱氢反应的环境，同时最大限度地减少副反应和催化剂失活。
