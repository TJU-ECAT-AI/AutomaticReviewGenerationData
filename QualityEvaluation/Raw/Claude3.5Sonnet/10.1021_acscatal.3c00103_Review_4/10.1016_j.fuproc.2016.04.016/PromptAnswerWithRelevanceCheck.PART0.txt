[1] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity and the physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."

[2] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."

[3] "Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."

[5] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions. Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Strong acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like cracking and coking. Titration of acid sites with alkali or using less acidic supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates can improve selectivity.
- Stability: The stability of the active metal species depends on their interaction with the support. For example, the nature of the support determines the predominant VOx structure in vanadium-based catalysts.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area: Mesoporous supports provide higher space-time yields due to their high surface area.
- Particle size: Smaller particles generally lead to higher activity, as seen with sub-nanometer platinum clusters.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Ionic exchange: Introducing metal ions through ionic exchange can create specific active sites.
- Doping: Adding promoters like alkali metals can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst.
- Physical mixing: Combining different components (e.g., Ga2O3 with H-MFI) can enhance certain reactions like aromatization.

These properties can be optimized by carefully selecting support materials, controlling the synthesis method, and introducing appropriate promoters or modifiers to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities like acid strength and stability play a crucial role. For instance, the acidity of the support material can lead to undesired side reactions such as cracking and coking. To address this, various support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Titration of acidic sites: For alumina supports, titrating acidic sites with alkali minimizes unwanted acid-catalyzed reactions, improving selectivity towards the desired products.

2. Use of less acidic supports: Zinc and magnesium aluminates are gaining popularity as they inherently have lower acidity and don't require additional alkali titration.

3. Alkali ion addition: Adding alkali ions to the support can increase selectivity (e.g., propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation), though it may decrease conversion rates due to reduced reducibility of the active metal oxides.

4. Support material combinations: Modifying supports with other oxides (e.g., MgO on Al2O3) can enhance selectivity in certain reactions.

5. Controlling metal-support interactions: The nature and interaction of the active metal (e.g., vanadium) with the support material influences the structure of the active sites, which in turn affects catalytic performance.

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between activity and selectivity by tailoring the acid-base properties, metal-support interactions, and overall surface chemistry of the catalyst. The goal is to create an environment that favors the desired dehydrogenation reaction while minimizing side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性起着关键作用。例如，载体材料的酸性可能导致不希望的副反应，如裂解和结焦。为解决这个问题，可以采用各种载体改性策略：

1. 酸性位点的滴定：对于氧化铝载体，用碱滴定酸性位点可以最大限度地减少不必要的酸催化反应，提高对目标产物的选择性。

2. 使用低酸性载体：锌和镁铝酸盐正在变得流行，因为它们本身具有较低的酸性，不需要额外的碱滴定。

3. 添加碱金属离子：向载体添加碱金属离子可以提高选择性（例如，在氧化脱氢中的丙烯选择性），但可能由于活性金属氧化物的可还原性降低而降低转化率。

4. 载体材料组合：用其他氧化物改性载体（例如，在Al2O3上添加MgO）可以在某些反应中提高选择性。

5. 控制金属-载体相互作用：活性金属（如钒）与载体材料的性质和相互作用影响活性位点的结构，进而影响催化性能。

这些策略旨在通过调整催化剂的酸碱性质、金属-载体相互作用和整体表面化学性质，优化活性和选择性之间的平衡。目标是创造一个有利于所需脱氢反应的环境，同时最大限度地减少副反应和催化剂失活。

[1] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[2] "VMgO systems have attracted special attention because of their relatively high selectivity and propene yield. Performances of VMgO for the ODH of propane are enhanced when promoted with redox metal ion(s). Propene selectivity of VMgO increase when promoted with alkali ions, but at the cost of a decline in activity."

[3] "Catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with increasing VOx (isolated monovanadates or polyvanadate) surface density until there is monolayer coverage of the support. Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds"

[5] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity. Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al., reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Eliminating proton sites in zeolites is crucial for achieving high alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. This suggests that reducing acidity can improve selectivity.

2. Chemical composition: VMgO systems show high selectivity and propene yield. Promotion with redox metal ions enhances performance, while alkali ion promotion increases selectivity at the cost of activity.

3. Surface density and dispersion: Catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts increases with VOx surface density up to monolayer coverage. This indicates the importance of optimizing metal loading.

4. Coordination environment: VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than connected V sites.

5. Support modification: Modifying Al2O3 with MgO for VOx catalysts increases propene selectivity. VOx/MgAl2O4 shows improved selectivity compared to VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Using mesoporous supports to increase surface area and space-time yields.
2. Modifying supports with alkaline earth oxides (e.g., MgO) to enhance selectivity.
3. Controlling metal loading to achieve optimal surface density and dispersion.
4. Tailoring the support composition to influence the coordination environment of active sites.
5. Incorporating promoters (e.g., redox metal ions or alkali ions) to fine-tune catalytic properties.

These strategies aim to balance activity and selectivity by optimizing the acid-base properties, metal-support interactions, and active site structures of the catalysts.

5. 载体改性：用MgO改性Al2O3作为VOx催化剂的载体可以提高丙烯选择性。VOx/MgAl2O4比VOx/Al2O3和MgO改性的VOx/Al2O3显示出更高的选择性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 使用介孔载体以增加表面积和空间时间产率。
