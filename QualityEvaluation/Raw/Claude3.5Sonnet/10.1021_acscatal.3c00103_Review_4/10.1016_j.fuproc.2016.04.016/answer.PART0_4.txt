[1] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially."

[2] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[3] "Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

[4] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity."

[5] "Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al., reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acid strength: Reducing acidity of support materials can improve selectivity by minimizing undesired side reactions like cracking and coking. This can be achieved through techniques like alkali titration of acidic sites on alumina supports.

2. Chemical stability: Using less acidic supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates can enhance stability and selectivity without requiring additional acid site titration.

3. Morphological characteristics: Monolayer coverage of active species (e.g., VOx) on support materials can optimize catalyst performance.

4. Support modification strategies:
   - Co-impregnation of precursors (e.g., Pt and Sn) can enhance interactions between active components.
   - Modifying alumina supports with MgO can increase propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
   - Using mixed oxide supports like MgAl2O4 can significantly improve selectivity compared to single oxide supports.

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between activity and selectivity by controlling acid-base properties, metal-support interactions, and dispersion of active sites. The goal is to create catalysts that efficiently activate C-H bonds while minimizing undesired side reactions, ultimately leading to higher yields of desired alkene products.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸强度：降低载体材料的酸性可以通过最小化不希望的副反应（如裂解和结焦）来提高选择性。这可以通过在氧化铝载体上对酸性位点进行碱性滴定等技术来实现。

2. 化学稳定性：使用酸性较低的载体（如锌和镁铝酸盐）可以提高稳定性和选择性，而无需额外的酸性位点滴定。

3. 形态特征：活性物种（如VOx）在载体材料上的单层覆盖可以优化催化剂性能。

4. 载体改性策略：
   - 前驱体（如Pt和Sn）的共浸渍可以增强活性组分之间的相互作用。
   - 用MgO改性氧化铝载体可以增加氧化脱氢反应中的丙烯选择性。
   - 使用混合氧化物载体（如MgAl2O4）可以显著提高选择性，相比于单一氧化物载体。

这些策略旨在通过控制酸碱性质、金属-载体相互作用和活性位点的分散来优化活性和选择性之间的平衡。目标是创造能够有效活化C-H键同时最小化不希望的副反应的催化剂，最终导致更高的目标烯烃产物产率。
