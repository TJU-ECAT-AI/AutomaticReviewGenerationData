[1] "Although the framework Ga2O3 on H-MFI seems to have a CH polarization effect on desorbed methane, Ga2O3 exhibits lower CH activation activity and the physical mixture of Ga2O3/HMFI displays higher propane aromatisation activity than pure H-MFI."

[2] "The exchanged metal ions in zeolites are held ionically by one or more basic oxygen atoms. Different species have been suggested, depending on the density of the cation exchange site of the zeolite and method of introduction of the metals."

[3] "Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."

[5] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions. Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Strong acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like cracking and coking. Titration of acid sites with alkali or using less acidic supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates can improve selectivity.
- Stability: The stability of the active metal species depends on their interaction with the support. For example, the nature of the support determines the predominant VOx structure in vanadium-based catalysts.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area: Mesoporous supports provide higher space-time yields due to their high surface area.
- Particle size: Smaller particles generally lead to higher activity, as seen with sub-nanometer platinum clusters.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Ionic exchange: Introducing metal ions through ionic exchange can create specific active sites.
- Doping: Adding promoters like alkali metals can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst.
- Physical mixing: Combining different components (e.g., Ga2O3 with H-MFI) can enhance certain reactions like aromatization.

These properties can be optimized by carefully selecting support materials, controlling the synthesis method, and introducing appropriate promoters or modifiers to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度：强酸性可能导致不希望的副反应，如裂解和结焦。用碱滴定酸性位点或使用较低酸性的载体（如锌和镁铝酸盐）可以提高选择性。
- 稳定性：活性金属物种的稳定性取决于它们与载体的相互作用。例如，载体的性质决定了钒基催化剂中主要的VOx结构。

2. 形态特征：
- 比表面积：介孔载体由于其高比表面积提供更高的空时产率。
- 粒径：一般来说，较小的粒子会导致更高的活性，如亚纳米级铂簇的情况。

3. 载体改性策略：
- 离子交换：通过离子交换引入金属离子可以创造特定的活性位点。
- 掺杂：添加如碱金属等促进剂可以改变催化剂的电子性质。
- 物理混合：结合不同的组分（如Ga2O3与H-MFI）可以增强某些反应，如芳构化。

通过精心选择载体材料、控制合成方法以及引入适当的促进剂或改性剂，可以优化这些性质，以提高脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。
