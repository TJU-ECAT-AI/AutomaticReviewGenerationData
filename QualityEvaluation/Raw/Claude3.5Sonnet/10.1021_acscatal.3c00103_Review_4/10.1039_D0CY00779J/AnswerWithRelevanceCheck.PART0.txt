          [1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "As confirmed in previous studies, the formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."

[5] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites."

[6] "The evident absorption peaks at 3780 cm1 are observable in the IR spectra of the Al2O3 dehydrated at 700 C (Fig. S5), and these bands are assigned to the defective AIII site which brings about the formation of Lewis acid sites."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study shows that Lewis acid sites, arising from defective AlIII sites in the Al2O3 structure, are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites positively correlates with the propane conversion rate, indicating that catalysts with more Lewis acid sites perform better.

The acid strength distribution (weak, moderate, and strong) also affects catalyst performance. NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR measurements reveal the presence and distribution of different types of acid sites in the catalysts, which impacts catalytic activity and selectivity.

Morphological characteristics, such as crystalline structure and surface area, influence catalyst performance. Different forms of Al2O3 (e.g., γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3) show varying levels of activity due to differences in their crystalline structures and the number of defective AlIII sites.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling crystalline structure: Tailoring synthesis conditions to promote specific Al2O3 phases (e.g., γ-Al2O3) with more defective AlIII sites.

2. Thermal treatment: Dehydrating Al2O3 at high temperatures (e.g., 700°C) to create more defective AlIII sites, thus increasing the number of Lewis acid sites.

3. Optimizing acid site distribution: Modifying preparation conditions to achieve an optimal balance between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, as well as weak, moderate, and strong acid sites.

4. Enhancing stability: Developing methods to reduce coke formation or improve the catalyst's resistance to deactivation, such as optimizing regeneration processes.

5. Surface area and porosity control: Adjusting textural properties to enhance the accessibility of active sites and improve mass transfer.

These strategies aim to maximize the number and accessibility of active Lewis acid sites while maintaining catalyst stability and selectivity, ultimately leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸强度、稳定性和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。研究表明，来自Al2O3结构中缺陷AlIII位点的Lewis酸位是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。Lewis酸位的数量与丙烷转化率呈正相关，表明具有更多Lewis酸位的催化剂性能更佳。

酸强度分布（弱、中、强）也影响催化剂性能。NH3-TPD和Py-FTIR测量揭示了催化剂中不同类型酸位的存在和分布，这影响催化活性和选择性。

晶体结构和表面积等形态特征影响催化剂性能。不同形式的Al2O3（如γ-Al2O3和θ-Al2O3）由于晶体结构和缺陷AlIII位点数量的差异而表现出不同水平的活性。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种载体修饰策略：

1. 控制晶体结构：调整合成条件以促进形成具有更多缺陷AlIII位点的特定Al2O3相（如γ-Al2O3）。

2. 热处理：在高温（如700°C）下脱水Al2O3，创造更多缺陷AlIII位点，从而增加Lewis酸位点的数量。

3. 优化酸位分布：修改制备条件，以达到Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位之间，以及弱、中、强酸位之间的最佳平衡。

4. 提高稳定性：开发减少积碳形成或提高催化剂抗失活能力的方法，如优化再生过程。

5. 控制表面积和孔隙度：调整织构性质，以增强活性位点的可及性并改善传质。

这些策略旨在最大化活性Lewis酸位点的数量和可及性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和选择性，最终提高丙烷脱氢反应的性能。
