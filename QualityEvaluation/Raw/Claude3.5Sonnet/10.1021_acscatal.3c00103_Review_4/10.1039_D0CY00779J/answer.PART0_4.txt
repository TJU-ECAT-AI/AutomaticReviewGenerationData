[1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study demonstrates that acid strength and type play crucial roles in catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Specifically, Lewis acid sites arising from defective AlIII sites in the Al2O3 structure are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites is positively correlated with the propane conversion rate, indicating that a higher concentration of these sites leads to improved catalytic performance.

The stability of the catalyst is another important factor. The study shows that the Al2O3 catalysts undergo deactivation due to coke formation at high reaction temperatures. However, this deactivation is reversible, and the catalyst can be regenerated through a simple calcination process.

Morphological characteristics, such as crystalline structure and textural properties, also affect catalytic performance. Different forms of Al2O3 (γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3) show varying levels of activity, with γ-Al2O3 exhibiting higher activity than θ-Al2O3.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling the crystalline structure: Synthesizing Al2O3 with specific crystalline phases (e.g., γ-Al2O3) that favor the formation of Lewis acid sites.

2. Optimizing acid site distribution: Tailoring the synthesis conditions to achieve an optimal balance between weak, moderate, and strong acid sites.

3. Enhancing stability: Developing methods to reduce coke formation or improve the catalyst's resistance to deactivation.

4. Modifying surface area and porosity: Adjusting the textural properties to enhance the accessibility of active sites and improve mass transfer.

5. Doping or modification: Although not explored in this study, introducing dopants or modifiers could potentially enhance the catalytic properties of Al2O3.

These strategies aim to maximize the concentration and accessibility of active Lewis acid sites while maintaining catalyst stability and selectivity, ultimately leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。该研究表明，酸强度和类型在催化效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。具体来说，Al2O3结构中缺陷AlIII位点产生的路易斯酸位被确定为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。路易斯酸位的数量与丙烷转化率呈正相关，表明这些位点的浓度越高，催化性能越好。

催化剂的稳定性是另一个重要因素。研究表明，Al2O3催化剂在高反应温度下会因积碳而失活。然而，这种失活是可逆的，可以通过简单的焙烧过程再生催化剂。

晶体结构和织构性质等形态特征也会影响催化性能。不同形式的Al2O3（γ-Al2O3和θ-Al2O3）表现出不同水平的活性，其中γ-Al2O3的活性高于θ-Al2O3。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种策略：

1. 控制晶体结构：合成特定晶相（如γ-Al2O3）的Al2O3，有利于路易斯酸位的形成。

2. 优化酸位分布：调整合成条件，以达到弱、中、强酸位之间的最佳平衡。

3. 提高稳定性：开发减少积碳形成或提高催化剂抗失活能力的方法。

4. 修改比表面积和孔隙度：调整织构性质，以增强活性位点的可及性并改善传质。

5. 掺杂或改性：虽然本研究未探讨，但引入掺杂剂或改性剂可能会增强Al2O3的催化性质。

这些策略旨在最大化活性路易斯酸位的浓度和可及性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和选择性，最终提高丙烷脱氢反应的性能。
