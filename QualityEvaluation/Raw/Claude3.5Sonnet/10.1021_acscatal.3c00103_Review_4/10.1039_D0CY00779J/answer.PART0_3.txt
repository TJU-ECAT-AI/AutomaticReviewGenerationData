[1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst shows the highest yield, which delivers an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%."

[5] "The evident absorption peaks at 3780 cm1 are observable in the IR spectra of the Al2O3 dehydrated at 700 C (Fig. S5), and these bands are assigned to the defective AIII site which brings about the formation of Lewis acid sites."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature demonstrates that the amount and type of acid sites play a crucial role in catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Lewis acid sites, arising from defective AlIII sites in the Al2O3 structure, are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The study shows a positive correlation between the number of Lewis acid sites and the propane conversion rate, indicating that catalysts with more Lewis acid sites perform better in the dehydrogenation reaction.

The strength of acid sites also affects catalyst performance. NH3-TPD measurements reveal the presence of weak, moderate, and strong acid sites in the catalysts, with different distributions among various Al2O3 samples. This distribution impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity.

Morphological characteristics, such as crystalline structure and surface area, also influence catalyst performance. For instance, γ-Al2O3 exhibits higher activity than θ-Al2O3, likely due to differences in their crystalline structures and the number of defective AlIII sites.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several strategies can be employed:

1. Control of crystalline structure: By tailoring the synthesis conditions, the formation of specific Al2O3 phases (e.g., γ-Al2O3) with more defective AlIII sites can be promoted.

2. Thermal treatment: Dehydration of Al2O3 at high temperatures (e.g., 700°C) can create more defective AlIII sites, thus increasing the number of Lewis acid sites.

3. Surface area optimization: Increasing the surface area of the catalyst can provide more accessible active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Acid site engineering: By carefully controlling the synthesis process, the distribution and strength of acid sites can be tuned to achieve the desired balance between activity and selectivity.

5. Doping or modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in this study, introducing dopants or modifiers could potentially enhance the stability and performance of the Al2O3 catalyst.

These strategies aim to maximize the number and accessibility of Lewis acid sites while maintaining catalyst stability and selectivity, ultimately leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献表明，酸性位点的数量和类型在催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

来自Al2O3结构中缺陷AlIII位点的Lewis酸位被确定为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。研究表明Lewis酸位点数量与丙烷转化率呈正相关，表明具有更多Lewis酸位点的催化剂在脱氢反应中表现更好。

酸性位点的强度也影响催化剂性能。NH3-TPD测量显示催化剂中存在弱、中等和强酸性位点，不同Al2O3样品中的分布不同。这种分布影响催化活性和选择性。

晶体结构和表面积等形态特征也影响催化剂性能。例如，γ-Al2O3的活性高于θ-Al2O3，这可能是由于它们的晶体结构和缺陷AlIII位点数量的差异。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种策略：

1. 控制晶体结构：通过调整合成条件，可以促进形成具有更多缺陷AlIII位点的特定Al2O3相（如γ-Al2O3）。

2. 热处理：在高温（如700°C）下脱水Al2O3可以创造更多缺陷AlIII位点，从而增加Lewis酸位点的数量。

3. 优化表面积：增加催化剂的表面积可以为脱氢反应提供更多可接触的活性位点。

4. 酸性位点工程：通过精确控制合成过程，可以调节酸性位点的分布和强度，以达到活性和选择性之间的理想平衡。

5. 掺杂或修饰：虽然本研究没有明确提及，但引入掺杂剂或修饰剂可能会增强Al2O3催化剂的稳定性和性能。

这些策略旨在最大化Lewis酸位点的数量和可接触性，同时保持催化剂的稳定性和选择性，最终提高丙烷脱氢反应的性能。
