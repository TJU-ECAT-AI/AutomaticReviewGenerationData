[1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study shows that acid strength and type play crucial roles in catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Lewis acid sites, arising from defective AlIII sites in the Al2O3 structure, are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites is positively correlated with the propane conversion rate, indicating that a higher concentration of these sites leads to better catalytic performance.

Morphological characteristics also affect catalyst performance. Different crystalline structures and textural properties of Al2O3 materials (γ-Al2O3-100, γ-Al2O3-200, and θ-Al2O3-90) result in varying catalytic activities. The γ-Al2O3 samples exhibit higher activity than θ-Al2O3, suggesting that the crystal structure influences the catalytic efficiency.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling the crystalline structure: By selecting the appropriate Al2O3 phase (e.g., γ-Al2O3 over θ-Al2O3), the number of active sites can be increased.

2. Tuning acid site distribution: Modifying the preparation conditions to increase the concentration of Lewis acid sites while minimizing Brønsted acid sites can improve selectivity towards dehydrogenation over cracking reactions.

3. Enhancing stability: The study shows that catalyst deactivation occurs due to coke formation. Developing strategies to minimize coke formation or improve coke resistance could enhance catalyst longevity.

4. Optimizing regeneration processes: The research demonstrates that a simple calcination process can effectively regenerate the catalyst. Further optimization of this process could lead to improved long-term stability and performance.

5. Surface area and porosity control: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given excerpts, optimizing the surface area and pore structure of the catalyst support could potentially improve the accessibility of active sites and enhance catalytic performance.

By carefully controlling these physicochemical properties through various support modification strategies, it is possible to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。研究表明，酸强度和类型在催化效率和选择性中起着至关重要的作用。源自Al2O3结构中缺陷AlIII位点的路易斯酸位被确定为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。路易斯酸位的数量与丙烷转化率呈正相关，表明这些位点的浓度越高，催化性能越好。

形态特征也影响催化剂性能。不同的Al2O3材料（γ-Al2O3-100、γ-Al2O3-200和θ-Al2O3-90）的晶体结构和织构性质导致催化活性不同。γ-Al2O3样品表现出比θ-Al2O3更高的活性，这表明晶体结构影响催化效率。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种载体修饰策略：

1. 控制晶体结构：通过选择适当的Al2O3相（例如，γ-Al2O3而不是θ-Al2O3），可以增加活性位点的数量。

2. 调整酸位分布：通过修改制备条件来增加路易斯酸位的浓度，同时最小化布朗斯特酸位，可以提高脱氢反应相对于裂解反应的选择性。

3. 提高稳定性：研究表明，催化剂失活是由于焦炭形成。开发最小化焦炭形成或提高抗焦炭能力的策略可以延长催化剂寿命。

4. 优化再生过程：研究表明，简单的煅烧过程可以有效地再生催化剂。进一步优化这一过程可能会提高长期稳定性和性能。

5. 表面积和孔隙度控制：虽然在给定的摘录中没有明确提到，但优化催化剂载体的表面积和孔结构可能会提高活性位点的可及性并增强催化性能。

通过仔细控制这些物理化学性质并采用各种载体修饰策略，有可能开发出更高效、更具选择性的丙烷脱氢反应催化剂。
