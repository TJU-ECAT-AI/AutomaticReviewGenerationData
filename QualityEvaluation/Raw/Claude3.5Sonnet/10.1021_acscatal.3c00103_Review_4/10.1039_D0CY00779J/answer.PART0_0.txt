[1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "As confirmed in previous studies, the formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature shows that the strength and distribution of acid sites, especially Lewis acid sites, are crucial for catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites is positively correlated with the propane conversion rate, indicating that these sites are the active centers for the reaction.

Morphological characteristics also play a role in catalyst performance. The presence of defective AIII sites in the Al2O3 structure leads to the formation of Lewis acid sites, which are essential for the catalytic cycle. Different crystalline structures and textural properties of Al2O3 materials result in varying catalytic performances.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several strategies can be employed:

1. Control of acid site distribution: By manipulating the synthesis conditions, the distribution of weak, moderate, and strong acid sites can be optimized to achieve the desired balance between activity and selectivity.

2. Structural modifications: Altering the crystalline structure of Al2O3 (e.g., γ-Al2O3 vs. θ-Al2O3) can affect the number and strength of Lewis acid sites, thereby influencing catalytic performance.

3. Thermal treatment: Careful control of calcination temperature can help optimize the number of defective AIII sites, which are responsible for Lewis acidity.

4. Regeneration processes: Implementing effective regeneration methods, such as calcination in air, can help maintain catalyst stability and activity over multiple cycles by removing coke deposits.

These strategies aim to enhance the catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics of the catalyst.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献表明，酸性位点的强度和分布，尤其是Lewis酸性位点，对丙烷脱氢的催化活性至关重要。Lewis酸性位点的数量与丙烷转化率呈正相关，表明这些位点是反应的活性中心。

形态特征也在催化剂性能中发挥作用。Al2O3结构中缺陷AIII位点的存在导致Lewis酸性位点的形成，这对催化循环至关重要。不同的Al2O3材料的晶体结构和织构性质导致不同的催化性能。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种策略：

1. 控制酸性位点分布：通过操纵合成条件，可以优化弱、中等和强酸性位点的分布，以达到活性和选择性之间的理想平衡。

2. 结构修饰：改变Al2O3的晶体结构（例如，γ-Al2O3与θ-Al2O3）可以影响Lewis酸性位点的数量和强度，从而影响催化性能。

3. 热处理：仔细控制煅烧温度可以帮助优化缺陷AIII位点的数量，这些位点负责Lewis酸性。

4. 再生过程：实施有效的再生方法，如在空气中煅烧，可以通过去除积碳沉积物来帮助维持催化剂在多个循环中的稳定性和活性。

这些策略旨在通过优化催化剂的酸强度、稳定性和形态特征之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。
