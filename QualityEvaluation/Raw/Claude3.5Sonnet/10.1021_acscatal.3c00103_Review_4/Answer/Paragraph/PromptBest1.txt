The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors affecting catalytic efficiency and selectivity include:

1. Acidity:
   - Proper acidity is crucial for C-H activation and propylene desorption [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_4].
   - Excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like cracking, coking, and deep dehydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.3c00103_4].
   - The balance between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites affects catalytic performance [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.09.006].
