          [1] "The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine)."

[2] "Complementary investigation by HAADF-STEM coupled with EDX analysis, indicates that the zirconium and sodium species are homogeneously distributed over the whole crystals, suggesting high dispersibilities of zirconium and alkali metal"

[3] "This demonstrates that alkali-metal cations could effectively weaken the acidic properties of the open Zr Lewis sites."

[4] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well."

[5] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

[6] "The characterization of textural and acid properties of the processed samples demonstrated that a proper alkaline treatment process could not change the texture properties of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite but greatly change their acidities on not only Brsnsted acid but also Lewis acid."

[7] "Typically, the conversion rate of FUR in the initial reaction period in three catalytic systems follows an order of Li+-Zr-Al-Beta > Na+-Zr-Al-Beta > K+-Zr-Al-Beta (Table 2, entry 46), which is consistent with the order of Lewis acidities of Zr species in M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites (Fig. 2 and 3b-d)."

[8] "When MOH concentration is higher than 0.025 M, however, FUR conversion on them begins to decrease with the increasing MOH concentration. Meanwhile, the resultant M/Al molar ratio in M+-Zr-Al-Beta is over 1.0. This indicates that the excessive metal ions are introduced by grafting to deprotonated silanol groups, which will further decrease the Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, even convert them into alkali ones."

[9] "Herein, Zr-MCM-41 and Na+-Zr-MCM-41 were also prepared as control samples. To study the influence of alkaline treatment in their structures, XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms of all samples were collected."

[10] "The FTIR spectroscopy in the hydroxyl stretching region of the parent Al-Beta, Zr-Al-Beta and other post-treated samples were shown in Fig. 1."

[11] "The local environments of Zr species in Zr-Al-Beta zeolites before and after alkaline treatment were studied by XPS analysis (Fig. 2)."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Key findings include:

1. Alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, altering their acidities without changing the textural properties. This is evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy.

2. The treatment transforms some Brønsted acid sites into Lewis acid sites while suppressing overall Lewis acidity.

3. Alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K) weaken the acidic properties of open Zr Lewis sites, with different ions having varying effects on catalytic activity (Li+ > Na+ > K+).

4. The concentration of alkali metal hydroxide used in the treatment is crucial. An optimal concentration (around 0.025 M) improves catalytic performance, while excessive concentrations can decrease Lewis acidity or even convert sites to basic ones.

5. Homogeneous distribution of zirconium and alkali metal species throughout the catalyst is achieved, as shown by HAADF-STEM and EDX analysis.

6. The alkaline treatment reduces carbon deposition, improving catalyst stability and reusability.

7. Various characterization techniques (XRD, N2 sorption isotherms, FTIR, XPS) were used to study the effects of alkaline treatment on catalyst structure and properties.

These modifications result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity towards desired products, and increased resistance to deactivation through carbon deposition. The optimized catalysts show better performance in reactions such as the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural, demonstrating higher yields of desired products and improved stability over multiple reaction cycles.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了如何使用Zr-Al-Beta沸石的碱性处理作为载体改性策略，以优化这些性质，提高催化效率和选择性。

主要发现包括：

1. 碱性处理修饰了沸石中的Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位，改变了它们的酸性，同时不改变其结构性质。这通过XPS和FT-IR光谱得到证实。

2. 该处理将一些Brønsted酸位转化为Lewis酸位，同时抑制整体Lewis酸性。

3. 碱金属离子（Li、Na、K）弱化了开放Zr Lewis位的酸性，不同离子对催化活性的影响不同（Li+ > Na+ > K+）。

4. 处理中使用的碱金属氢氧化物浓度至关重要。最佳浓度（约0.025 M）可以提高催化性能，而过高的浓度会降低Lewis酸性，甚至将酸位转变为碱位。

5. 通过HAADF-STEM和EDX分析显示，锆和碱金属物种在整个催化剂中均匀分布。

6. 碱性处理减少了碳沉积，提高了催化剂的稳定性和可重复使用性。

7. 使用多种表征技术（XRD、N2吸脱附等温线、FTIR、XPS）研究了碱性处理对催化剂结构和性质的影响。

这些改性导致催化效率提高、对目标产物的选择性改善以及通过碳沉积而导致的失活抗性增加。优化后的催化剂在诸如糠醛的Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley（MPV）还原等反应中表现出更好的性能，呈现出更高的目标产物产率和多个反应周期的改进稳定性。
