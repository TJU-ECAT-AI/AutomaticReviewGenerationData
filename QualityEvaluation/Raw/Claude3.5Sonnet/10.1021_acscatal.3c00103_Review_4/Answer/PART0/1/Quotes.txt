[1] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites. The band at higher wavenumber, centered at 3738 cm1, is assigned to type IIa hydroxyls"

[2] "Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species."

[3] "Ca donates electron to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene."

[4] "The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites"

[5] "Ca also enhances the selectivity towards propylene as discussed previously."

[6] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[7] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[8] "Ca decreases acidity, ii- increase of Pt dispersion, and iii- prevention of sintering of metal particles."

[9] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."

[10] "The disappearance of the first peak, which is related to the coke species on the metal sites, supports the further reduction of GeOx species in the Ca-promoted-sample, enhancing the geometric modification of Pt and, therefore, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation."

[11] "The fading of the second peak clearly highlights the positive role of Ca in suppressing acidic centres."

[12] "The higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge."

[13] "Ca-promoted catalyst is less active for coke deactivation, (ψd)."

[14] "The addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

[15] "Upon modifying support with Ca, the desorption temperatures shift to lower temperature, suggesting that Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption."

[16] "Adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3. As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

[1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "As confirmed in previous studies, the formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."

[5] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites."

[6] "The evident absorption peaks at 3780 cm1 are observable in the IR spectra of the Al2O3 dehydrated at 700 C (Fig. S5), and these bands are assigned to the defective AIII site which brings about the formation of Lewis acid sites."

[1] "The promotional effect of silanol nests on intermetallic alloy formation is an intriguing phenomenon, and is expected to trigger investigations of other metal alloy catalysts."

[2] "It appears that there is a significant modification of the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation, which resulted in a distinct change in the hydrogen adsorption properties on the metal surface."

[3] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc"

[4] "This effect with high loading may be explained by the increase in metal facet areas, which favor coke generation"

[5] "The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 31003900 cm1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols"

[6] "Based on the IR investigation, the zeolite samples could be classified into two groups, represented as a group of zeolites with silanol nest defects (i.e., MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) and a defect-free zeolite (i.e., MZ-sc)."

[7] "The generation of the silanol nests is believed to be affected by the absence of Na+ ions. They are known to promote the dissolutionrecrystallization process during the zeolite crystallization, which in turn can heal the temporarily created defect sites and remove the silanol nests."

[8] "This result is notable in that the formation of Pt3Y nanoparticles can simply be achieved without post-synthetic degallation of a gallosilicate zeolite."

[9] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."

[10] "We suggest that the sodium-free synthesis results in the spontaneous generation of silanol nest defects, as in the case of post-synthetic degallation."

[11] "These results suggest that the silanol nests generated by the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br have a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior upon changes in the electronic state of Pt."

[12] "Furthermore, to confirm the effect of silanol nests, the PDH reaction was measured with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl, where the zeolite support was synthesized by simply adding a small amount of NaCl into the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br. Despite the minor change of NaCl addition, there was a large difference in the PDH conversion between PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl."

[13] "The formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite."

[14] "Herein, an important question was how to effectively generate the silanol nests in a sufficient concentration, whereas ordinary zeolites possess only a small number of silanol nests in the framework"

[15] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."

[1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."

[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."

[3] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

[1] "The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique"

[2] "Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports."

[3] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance."

[4] "In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."

[5] "Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

[6] "It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."

[7] "To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9. The propane conversions of Cr/Z-5 catalysts improve with the increase of the amount of acidic sites, while their propylene selectivity and yield decrease with the increase of the amount of acidic sites"

[8] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance."

[9] "The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio"

[10] "Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."

[1] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst."

[2] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene."

[3] "The acid and base sites of the support also affect the performance of the catalyst and can be adjusted with promotors."

[4] "Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions."

[5] "Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2."

[6] "Therefore, a balance of these sites is necessary to promote sufficient propane activation and propene desorption."

[7] "The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase."

[8] "It was found that the acidic nature of the alumina support, over which dehydrogenated propene adsorbed to the support surface where it further oxidised to COx species. This effect is less prominent on less acidic support surfaces such as SiO2 and MCM-41."

[9] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. It is proposed that VOsupport bonds are active sites, as lattice oxygen in VO bonds directly catalyses CH activation forming H2."

[10] "The acidic promoter influences both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst by reducing the surface acidity of alumina, thus suppressing undesired side reactions."

[11] "Limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as catalytic cracking and coke formation. However, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups can function as nucleation sites for Pt, enhancing dispersion."

[12] "Regardless of catalyst, common themes have been established in efforts to improve CH bond activation, reducing propane and hydrogen adsorption on surface sites. Of these, supports with weak and moderate surface acidity coupled promoting elements (B, Ga, Cu and Ni to name a few) result in lower Pt utilisation, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts."

[13] "Acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity."

"The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications."

"27Al magic-angle spinning NMR spectra indicated that approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al was retained in the zeolite framework even after being heated in 100% steam at 700C (Supplementary Fig. 5)."

"The catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1). These enhanced catalytic activities can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (that is, on the external surface of the zeolite layer) of MFI nanosheets, with the unilamellar MFI generally exhibiting higher activities owing to its larger external surface area after calcination."

"Another remarkable feature of the MFI nanosheets is their increased catalyst lifetime, which manifested itself when we investigated the catalytic properties of MFI zeolites in methanol-to-gasoline conversion."

"We therefore propose that the long catalytic lifetime of the MFI nanosheets is due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external zeolite surfaces, which arises because of facile mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores."

[1] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[2] "Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

[3] "Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."

[5] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[6] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation. The influence of tin on platinum performance can be electronic or geometric."

[7] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially."

[8] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."

[9] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[10] "VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds"

[11] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity. Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al., reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."

[1] "There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption."

[2] "Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin."

[3] "TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst."

[4] "For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime."

[5] "The UVvis spectra for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3f) reveal equivalent internal coke between seed and finned samples; however, there is a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke for the finned sample, which suggests the presence of external protrusions leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths."

[6] "Analogous to studies by Ryoo and co-workers10, who showed that hierarchical zeolites that possess a high external surface area markedly reduce external coking, we demonstrate a similar effect for finned catalysts, and focus on two common 3D medium-pore zeolites: ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework)."

[7] "To substantiate the enhanced mass-transport properties of zeolites after secondary growth, we assessed the performance of the acid-exchanged (H-form) seed and finned samples in the MTH reaction at subcomplete methanol conversion (6090%)."

[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

[4] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[5] "The coordination number of the ad-atom is only 3, which is significantly smaller than CN of the surface atoms on (111) (CN = 9), (211) step edge (CN = 7) and ad-row atoms (CN = 5). It is expected that the strongest binding of a surface intermediate should be observed on an ad-atom due to its smallest coordination number."

[6] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework. Joshi and Thomson showed that [GaH]2+ is more stable in a six-membered ring structure than in an eight-membered ring."

[7] "Besides the position of Al atoms, the topology of zeolite framework also affects the dehydrogenation activity. Wannakao et al. calculated the methane activation in Au-substituted FAU, FER, ZSM-5 and MCM-22."

[8] "Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the higher d-band center of Ni(100) surface (1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (1.78 eV)."

[9] "Besides the electronic effect, a strong stabilization of adsorbed C atoms was observed on Ni(100), which binds >100 kJ mol1 stronger than a C atom on Ni(111). The more stable tetra-coordinated C on Ni(100) reflects the needs of a C atom to satisfy its valence."

[10] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism: (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."

[5] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa."

[6] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."

[7] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability."

"The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."

"Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions."

"The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice."

"The larger mesopores allow bulky reactants to access the catalytic sites within the zeolite crystals, thereby promoting the primary reactions to yield more gasoline and LCO."

"The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites."

"Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."

"The catalytic activity of the catalysts increased as their mesoporous volume and the accessible surface area increased."

"The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment."

"The hierarchical zeolites exhibit slower deactivation of the active sites, shorter retention time of products in the micropores, and less secondary coke product formation."

"The large external surface area and tunable surface properties have received much interest."

"The effective improvement of CO2 adsorption mainly originated from the large surface area, which promoted the CO2 adsorption capacity."

"The mesopores thus serve as hosts for large biological molecules or metal complexes."

[1] "The electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support, as can be seen from the changes in the Pt binding energy and stretching frequency of adsorbed CO."

[2] "At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites."

[3] "The changes in the electronic properties of the supported platinum crystallites are evidenced by the shifts of the Pt binding energy in XPS and of the stretching frequency of linearly adsorbed CO. The changes depend on the catalyst acidities: the shifts are increased with increasing concentration of the acid sites."

[4] "When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts."

[5] "The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well."

[6] "The alteration of the electronic properties of supported metals by the support is well documented in the literature for various supports, especially reducible oxides, such as TiO2, and zeolites."

[7] "The shifts to lower frequency in the infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on supported metals correlate with the increasing support alkalinity and are attributable to the changes in the electron density of the supported metal."

[8] "When zeolites are modified with platinum, the conversion of decalin follows the same overall reaction scheme (see Figure 5), but the initial reaction step of the underlying reaction mechanism is different."

[9] "It can thus be concluded from the experimental data on decalin ring opening that the introduction of platinum into zeolites results in the reduction of the acid site strengths and, consequently, in the suppression of the cracking reactions."

[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "The diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[4] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."

[5] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction"

[6] "In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene"

[1] "Zn-modified zeolites exhibit high activity for the aromatization of C2+ alkanes."
          
          [2] "The catalysts, which are traditionally prepared by the ion exchange or impregnation of ZSM-5 zeolite (ammonia- or acid-form) with aqueous solution of zinc salts, have demonstrated significantly higher activity and selectivity for aromatics as compared to the catalysts based on pure acid-form ZSM-5 zeolite"
          
          [3] "The studies of the composition and the state of zinc introduced into the zeolites by the ion exchange methods have shown the presence of different Zn-species: isolated Zn2+ cations and zinc oxide particles of various dimensions and localization."
          
          [4] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide synergy with BAS for propane CH bond activation."
          
          [5] "Zn2+ and ZnO species show dramatic acceleration of H/D exchange of propane with BAS."
          
          [6] "The accelerating effect of isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced compared to zinc oxide clusters."
          
          [7] "ZSM-5 zeolite containing only Zn2+ cations and BAS was shown to activate small alkanes, including methane"
          
          [8] "Zn-modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite containing only zinc oxide ZnmOn clusters and BAS also showed an enhanced catalytic activity in propane conversion towards the aromatics"
          
          [9] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher."
          
          [10] "Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied."
          
          [11] "For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane."

[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with an acceptable deactivation rate of ∼ 0.02 h−1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h−1 is achieved in the presence of H2."

[1] "NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity."

          [2] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

          [3] "Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds."

[1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

[5] "The desilication of ZSM-5 with NaOH solution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol·L1 leads to a decrease of crystallinity, but the topology of MFI is still well kept."

[6] "The stability of the Pt particles at the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by the manipulation of metal-support interaction"

[1] "The textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts."

[2] "Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price."

[3] "Additionally, doping can also help increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al."

[4] "Although acidic supports are also undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg. It is revealed that the amount of acidic sites of CrZrO catalysts is reduced for K (0.2%, 0.5%, or 1%) doping, leading to an enhanced C3H6 selectivity and resistance to coke formation in PDH reaction."

[5] "The acidbase pairs of metal oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are deactivated owing to coke deposition, and as for Pt-based catalysts, periodical regeneration become indispensable."

[6] "Although metal oxides (such as Al2O3 and ZrO2) have been widely studied as supports for CrOx and VOx catalysts, the stability is still too low due to the strong acidity of supports."

[7] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."

[8] "An appropriate promoter that improves the overall activity, selectivity, and anti-coking capability is still under discovery."

[9] "Doping with another component could inhibit the transformation process. For example, B. Ersoy et al. observed that the addition of La2O3 to solgel derived alumina gels increased the γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 transformation temperature to 1200 C."

[10] "The acidic sites are undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg."

[11] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI"

[12] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."

[13] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."

[14] "The supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[15] "Experimental evidence indicated that appropriate Mg addition promotes the dispersion of V2O5 nanoparticles from three dimensional to two dimensional VOx species which extremely reduce coke deposition and then enhance stability on a large scale."

[16] "Differing from metal-based catalysts, the Lewis acid MO sites in metal oxides can also effectively activate the propane CH bonds."

[17] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it. Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."

[18] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."

[1] "Microporous zeolites are unique with respect to molecular sieving and shape/size selectivity but this is a limiting factor in the fine chemical industries or even in the petrochemical industries involving large organic molecules. The small size of the channels (less than 8 Å) and cavities (typically <15 Å) imposes diffusion constraints on reactions involving large organic molecules and exhibits high back pressure on the flow systems"

[2] "Mesoporous zeolites exhibited higher catalytic activity in various acid catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity. Activities of mesoporous zeolites are similar to that of the conventional zeolites in the reactions involving small molecules. Moreover, mesoporous zeolites exhibited significant retardation in the catalyst deactivation in vapour phase and liquid phase reactions when compared with conventional zeolites."

[3] "High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance."

[4] "Mesoporous zeolites could play an important role in various inter-disciplinary research areas because of their enhanced textural properties, compared to the conventional micron-sized zeolites. Small particle size and mesoporosity present in these materials decrease the diffusion path length and provide readily accessible active sites in the fine chemical synthesis involving large molecules."

[1] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[2] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters."

[3] "Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."

[4] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[5] "To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition."

[6] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."

[7] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

[8] "The transition of γ-alumina to θ-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina."

[1] "The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine)."

[2] "Complementary investigation by HAADF-STEM coupled with EDX analysis, indicates that the zirconium and sodium species are homogeneously distributed over the whole crystals, suggesting high dispersibilities of zirconium and alkali metal"

[3] "This demonstrates that alkali-metal cations could effectively weaken the acidic properties of the open Zr Lewis sites."

[4] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well."

[5] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

[6] "The characterization of textural and acid properties of the processed samples demonstrated that a proper alkaline treatment process could not change the texture properties of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite but greatly change their acidities on not only Brsnsted acid but also Lewis acid."

[7] "Typically, the conversion rate of FUR in the initial reaction period in three catalytic systems follows an order of Li+-Zr-Al-Beta > Na+-Zr-Al-Beta > K+-Zr-Al-Beta (Table 2, entry 46), which is consistent with the order of Lewis acidities of Zr species in M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites (Fig. 2 and 3b-d)."

[8] "When MOH concentration is higher than 0.025 M, however, FUR conversion on them begins to decrease with the increasing MOH concentration. Meanwhile, the resultant M/Al molar ratio in M+-Zr-Al-Beta is over 1.0. This indicates that the excessive metal ions are introduced by grafting to deprotonated silanol groups, which will further decrease the Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, even convert them into alkali ones."

[9] "Herein, Zr-MCM-41 and Na+-Zr-MCM-41 were also prepared as control samples. To study the influence of alkaline treatment in their structures, XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms of all samples were collected."

[10] "The FTIR spectroscopy in the hydroxyl stretching region of the parent Al-Beta, Zr-Al-Beta and other post-treated samples were shown in Fig. 1."

[11] "The local environments of Zr species in Zr-Al-Beta zeolites before and after alkaline treatment were studied by XPS analysis (Fig. 2)."

[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

[2] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

[4] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

[5] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at the micro and meso levels exhibit fast transport and relatively high hydrothermal stability, combining catalytic properties of microporous and mesoporous zeolites."

[6] "The introduction of an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal is an effective approach to balance the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support and further inhibit catalytic deactivation."

[1] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites. The band at higher wavenumber, centered at 3738 cm1, is assigned to type IIa hydroxyls"

[2] "Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species."

[3] "Ca donates electron to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene."

[4] "The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites"

[5] "Ca also enhances the selectivity towards propylene as discussed previously."

[6] "Ca suppresses strong acid sites of ZSM-5 and accelerates Sn reduction, resulting in a high percentage of alloy formation."

[7] "Neutralizing strong acidic sites and modifying electronic properties of Pt were some of the positive effects ascribed to Ca, since it suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption due to the increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke."

[8] "Ca decreases acidity, ii- increase of Pt dispersion, and iii- prevention of sintering of metal particles."

[9] "Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca."

[10] "The disappearance of the first peak, which is related to the coke species on the metal sites, supports the further reduction of GeOx species in the Ca-promoted-sample, enhancing the geometric modification of Pt and, therefore, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation."

[11] "The fading of the second peak clearly highlights the positive role of Ca in suppressing acidic centres."

[12] "The higher activation energy for the promoted sample can be related to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species boosted by Ca as discussed in Section 3.1.4, resulting in higher degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge."

[13] "Ca-promoted catalyst is less active for coke deactivation, (ψd)."

[14] "The addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

[15] "Upon modifying support with Ca, the desorption temperatures shift to lower temperature, suggesting that Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption."

[16] "Adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3. As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity."

[1] "The NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively."

[2] "As confirmed in previous studies, the formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure."

[3] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3)."

[4] "The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air."

[5] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites."

[6] "The evident absorption peaks at 3780 cm1 are observable in the IR spectra of the Al2O3 dehydrated at 700 C (Fig. S5), and these bands are assigned to the defective AIII site which brings about the formation of Lewis acid sites."

[1] "The promotional effect of silanol nests on intermetallic alloy formation is an intriguing phenomenon, and is expected to trigger investigations of other metal alloy catalysts."

[2] "It appears that there is a significant modification of the electronic state of Pt upon intermetallic compound formation, which resulted in a distinct change in the hydrogen adsorption properties on the metal surface."

[3] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst exhibited slow deactivation over 20 d as mentioned above, but PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl was deactivated within 1 d, similar to that of Pt(0.5)/MZ-sc"

[4] "This effect with high loading may be explained by the increase in metal facet areas, which favor coke generation"

[5] "The OH-stretching bands are normally observed in the frequency region of 31003900 cm1, varying according to the interactions between the silanols"

[6] "Based on the IR investigation, the zeolite samples could be classified into two groups, represented as a group of zeolites with silanol nest defects (i.e., MZ-dg, MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) and a defect-free zeolite (i.e., MZ-sc)."

[7] "The generation of the silanol nests is believed to be affected by the absence of Na+ ions. They are known to promote the dissolutionrecrystallization process during the zeolite crystallization, which in turn can heal the temporarily created defect sites and remove the silanol nests."

[8] "This result is notable in that the formation of Pt3Y nanoparticles can simply be achieved without post-synthetic degallation of a gallosilicate zeolite."

[9] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."

[10] "We suggest that the sodium-free synthesis results in the spontaneous generation of silanol nest defects, as in the case of post-synthetic degallation."

[11] "These results suggest that the silanol nests generated by the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br have a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior upon changes in the electronic state of Pt."

[12] "Furthermore, to confirm the effect of silanol nests, the PDH reaction was measured with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl, where the zeolite support was synthesized by simply adding a small amount of NaCl into the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br. Despite the minor change of NaCl addition, there was a large difference in the PDH conversion between PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl."

[13] "The formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite."

[14] "Herein, an important question was how to effectively generate the silanol nests in a sufficient concentration, whereas ordinary zeolites possess only a small number of silanol nests in the framework"

[15] "When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K."

[1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."

[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."

[3] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

[1] "The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique"

[2] "Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports."

[3] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance."

[4] "In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."

[5] "Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

[6] "It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."

[7] "To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9. The propane conversions of Cr/Z-5 catalysts improve with the increase of the amount of acidic sites, while their propylene selectivity and yield decrease with the increase of the amount of acidic sites"

[8] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance."

[9] "The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio"

[10] "Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."

[1] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst."

[2] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene."

[3] "The acid and base sites of the support also affect the performance of the catalyst and can be adjusted with promotors."

[4] "Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions."

[5] "Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2."

[6] "Therefore, a balance of these sites is necessary to promote sufficient propane activation and propene desorption."

[7] "The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase."

[8] "It was found that the acidic nature of the alumina support, over which dehydrogenated propene adsorbed to the support surface where it further oxidised to COx species. This effect is less prominent on less acidic support surfaces such as SiO2 and MCM-41."

[9] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. It is proposed that VOsupport bonds are active sites, as lattice oxygen in VO bonds directly catalyses CH activation forming H2."

[10] "The acidic promoter influences both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst by reducing the surface acidity of alumina, thus suppressing undesired side reactions."

[11] "Limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as catalytic cracking and coke formation. However, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups can function as nucleation sites for Pt, enhancing dispersion."

[12] "Regardless of catalyst, common themes have been established in efforts to improve CH bond activation, reducing propane and hydrogen adsorption on surface sites. Of these, supports with weak and moderate surface acidity coupled promoting elements (B, Ga, Cu and Ni to name a few) result in lower Pt utilisation, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts."

[13] "Acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity."

"The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications."

"27Al magic-angle spinning NMR spectra indicated that approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al was retained in the zeolite framework even after being heated in 100% steam at 700C (Supplementary Fig. 5)."

"The catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1). These enhanced catalytic activities can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (that is, on the external surface of the zeolite layer) of MFI nanosheets, with the unilamellar MFI generally exhibiting higher activities owing to its larger external surface area after calcination."

"Another remarkable feature of the MFI nanosheets is their increased catalyst lifetime, which manifested itself when we investigated the catalytic properties of MFI zeolites in methanol-to-gasoline conversion."

"We therefore propose that the long catalytic lifetime of the MFI nanosheets is due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external zeolite surfaces, which arises because of facile mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores."

[1] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[2] "Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

[3] "Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."

[5] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[6] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation. The influence of tin on platinum performance can be electronic or geometric."

[7] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially."

[8] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."

[9] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[10] "VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds"

[11] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity. Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al., reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."

[1] "There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption."

[2] "Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin."

[3] "TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst."

[4] "For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime."

[5] "The UVvis spectra for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3f) reveal equivalent internal coke between seed and finned samples; however, there is a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke for the finned sample, which suggests the presence of external protrusions leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths."

[6] "Analogous to studies by Ryoo and co-workers10, who showed that hierarchical zeolites that possess a high external surface area markedly reduce external coking, we demonstrate a similar effect for finned catalysts, and focus on two common 3D medium-pore zeolites: ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework)."

[7] "To substantiate the enhanced mass-transport properties of zeolites after secondary growth, we assessed the performance of the acid-exchanged (H-form) seed and finned samples in the MTH reaction at subcomplete methanol conversion (6090%)."

[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

[4] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[5] "The coordination number of the ad-atom is only 3, which is significantly smaller than CN of the surface atoms on (111) (CN = 9), (211) step edge (CN = 7) and ad-row atoms (CN = 5). It is expected that the strongest binding of a surface intermediate should be observed on an ad-atom due to its smallest coordination number."

[6] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework. Joshi and Thomson showed that [GaH]2+ is more stable in a six-membered ring structure than in an eight-membered ring."

[7] "Besides the position of Al atoms, the topology of zeolite framework also affects the dehydrogenation activity. Wannakao et al. calculated the methane activation in Au-substituted FAU, FER, ZSM-5 and MCM-22."

[8] "Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the higher d-band center of Ni(100) surface (1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (1.78 eV)."

[9] "Besides the electronic effect, a strong stabilization of adsorbed C atoms was observed on Ni(100), which binds >100 kJ mol1 stronger than a C atom on Ni(111). The more stable tetra-coordinated C on Ni(100) reflects the needs of a C atom to satisfy its valence."

[10] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism: (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."

[5] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa."

[6] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."

[7] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability."

"The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."

"Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions."

"The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice."

"The larger mesopores allow bulky reactants to access the catalytic sites within the zeolite crystals, thereby promoting the primary reactions to yield more gasoline and LCO."

"The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites."

"Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."

"The catalytic activity of the catalysts increased as their mesoporous volume and the accessible surface area increased."

"The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment."

"The hierarchical zeolites exhibit slower deactivation of the active sites, shorter retention time of products in the micropores, and less secondary coke product formation."

"The large external surface area and tunable surface properties have received much interest."

"The effective improvement of CO2 adsorption mainly originated from the large surface area, which promoted the CO2 adsorption capacity."

"The mesopores thus serve as hosts for large biological molecules or metal complexes."

[1] "The electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support, as can be seen from the changes in the Pt binding energy and stretching frequency of adsorbed CO."

[2] "At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites."

[3] "The changes in the electronic properties of the supported platinum crystallites are evidenced by the shifts of the Pt binding energy in XPS and of the stretching frequency of linearly adsorbed CO. The changes depend on the catalyst acidities: the shifts are increased with increasing concentration of the acid sites."

[4] "When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts."

[5] "The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well."

[6] "The alteration of the electronic properties of supported metals by the support is well documented in the literature for various supports, especially reducible oxides, such as TiO2, and zeolites."

[7] "The shifts to lower frequency in the infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on supported metals correlate with the increasing support alkalinity and are attributable to the changes in the electron density of the supported metal."

[8] "When zeolites are modified with platinum, the conversion of decalin follows the same overall reaction scheme (see Figure 5), but the initial reaction step of the underlying reaction mechanism is different."

[9] "It can thus be concluded from the experimental data on decalin ring opening that the introduction of platinum into zeolites results in the reduction of the acid site strengths and, consequently, in the suppression of the cracking reactions."

[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "The diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[4] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."

[5] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction"

[6] "In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene"

[1] "Zn-modified zeolites exhibit high activity for the aromatization of C2+ alkanes."
          
          [2] "The catalysts, which are traditionally prepared by the ion exchange or impregnation of ZSM-5 zeolite (ammonia- or acid-form) with aqueous solution of zinc salts, have demonstrated significantly higher activity and selectivity for aromatics as compared to the catalysts based on pure acid-form ZSM-5 zeolite"
          
          [3] "The studies of the composition and the state of zinc introduced into the zeolites by the ion exchange methods have shown the presence of different Zn-species: isolated Zn2+ cations and zinc oxide particles of various dimensions and localization."
          
          [4] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide synergy with BAS for propane CH bond activation."
          
          [5] "Zn2+ and ZnO species show dramatic acceleration of H/D exchange of propane with BAS."
          
          [6] "The accelerating effect of isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced compared to zinc oxide clusters."
          
          [7] "ZSM-5 zeolite containing only Zn2+ cations and BAS was shown to activate small alkanes, including methane"
          
          [8] "Zn-modified H-ZSM-5 zeolite containing only zinc oxide ZnmOn clusters and BAS also showed an enhanced catalytic activity in propane conversion towards the aromatics"
          
          [9] "Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher."
          
          [10] "Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied."
          
          [11] "For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane."

[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with an acceptable deactivation rate of ∼ 0.02 h−1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h−1 is achieved in the presence of H2."

[1] "NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity."

          [2] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

          [3] "Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds."

[1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

[5] "The desilication of ZSM-5 with NaOH solution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol·L1 leads to a decrease of crystallinity, but the topology of MFI is still well kept."

[6] "The stability of the Pt particles at the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by the manipulation of metal-support interaction"

[1] "The textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts."

[2] "Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price."

[3] "Additionally, doping can also help increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al."

[4] "Although acidic supports are also undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg. It is revealed that the amount of acidic sites of CrZrO catalysts is reduced for K (0.2%, 0.5%, or 1%) doping, leading to an enhanced C3H6 selectivity and resistance to coke formation in PDH reaction."

[5] "The acidbase pairs of metal oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are deactivated owing to coke deposition, and as for Pt-based catalysts, periodical regeneration become indispensable."

[6] "Although metal oxides (such as Al2O3 and ZrO2) have been widely studied as supports for CrOx and VOx catalysts, the stability is still too low due to the strong acidity of supports."

[7] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."

[8] "An appropriate promoter that improves the overall activity, selectivity, and anti-coking capability is still under discovery."

[9] "Doping with another component could inhibit the transformation process. For example, B. Ersoy et al. observed that the addition of La2O3 to solgel derived alumina gels increased the γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 transformation temperature to 1200 C."

[10] "The acidic sites are undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg."

[11] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI"

[12] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."

[13] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."

[14] "The supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[15] "Experimental evidence indicated that appropriate Mg addition promotes the dispersion of V2O5 nanoparticles from three dimensional to two dimensional VOx species which extremely reduce coke deposition and then enhance stability on a large scale."

[16] "Differing from metal-based catalysts, the Lewis acid MO sites in metal oxides can also effectively activate the propane CH bonds."

[17] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it. Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."

[18] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."

[1] "Microporous zeolites are unique with respect to molecular sieving and shape/size selectivity but this is a limiting factor in the fine chemical industries or even in the petrochemical industries involving large organic molecules. The small size of the channels (less than 8 Å) and cavities (typically <15 Å) imposes diffusion constraints on reactions involving large organic molecules and exhibits high back pressure on the flow systems"

[2] "Mesoporous zeolites exhibited higher catalytic activity in various acid catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity. Activities of mesoporous zeolites are similar to that of the conventional zeolites in the reactions involving small molecules. Moreover, mesoporous zeolites exhibited significant retardation in the catalyst deactivation in vapour phase and liquid phase reactions when compared with conventional zeolites."

[3] "High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance."

[4] "Mesoporous zeolites could play an important role in various inter-disciplinary research areas because of their enhanced textural properties, compared to the conventional micron-sized zeolites. Small particle size and mesoporosity present in these materials decrease the diffusion path length and provide readily accessible active sites in the fine chemical synthesis involving large molecules."

[1] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[2] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters."

[3] "Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction."

[4] "Indeed, it was found that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity."

[5] "To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition."

[6] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."

[7] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

[8] "The transition of γ-alumina to θ-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina."

[1] "The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine)."

[2] "Complementary investigation by HAADF-STEM coupled with EDX analysis, indicates that the zirconium and sodium species are homogeneously distributed over the whole crystals, suggesting high dispersibilities of zirconium and alkali metal"

[3] "This demonstrates that alkali-metal cations could effectively weaken the acidic properties of the open Zr Lewis sites."

[4] "Taking the above characterization results of active sites into account, it is confirmed that alkaline treatment not only transfers Brnsted acid sites of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite into Lewis acid sites but suppresses its Lewis acidity as well."

[5] "Obviously, the alkaline treatment process can reduce carbon deposition, which can be assigned to modification effect of alkali metal ions on the Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite."

[6] "The characterization of textural and acid properties of the processed samples demonstrated that a proper alkaline treatment process could not change the texture properties of Zr-Al-Beta zeolite but greatly change their acidities on not only Brsnsted acid but also Lewis acid."

[7] "Typically, the conversion rate of FUR in the initial reaction period in three catalytic systems follows an order of Li+-Zr-Al-Beta > Na+-Zr-Al-Beta > K+-Zr-Al-Beta (Table 2, entry 46), which is consistent with the order of Lewis acidities of Zr species in M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites (Fig. 2 and 3b-d)."

[8] "When MOH concentration is higher than 0.025 M, however, FUR conversion on them begins to decrease with the increasing MOH concentration. Meanwhile, the resultant M/Al molar ratio in M+-Zr-Al-Beta is over 1.0. This indicates that the excessive metal ions are introduced by grafting to deprotonated silanol groups, which will further decrease the Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, even convert them into alkali ones."

[9] "Herein, Zr-MCM-41 and Na+-Zr-MCM-41 were also prepared as control samples. To study the influence of alkaline treatment in their structures, XRD patterns and N2 sorption isotherms of all samples were collected."

[10] "The FTIR spectroscopy in the hydroxyl stretching region of the parent Al-Beta, Zr-Al-Beta and other post-treated samples were shown in Fig. 1."

[11] "The local environments of Zr species in Zr-Al-Beta zeolites before and after alkaline treatment were studied by XPS analysis (Fig. 2)."

[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

[2] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

[4] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

[5] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at the micro and meso levels exhibit fast transport and relatively high hydrothermal stability, combining catalytic properties of microporous and mesoporous zeolites."

[6] "The introduction of an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal is an effective approach to balance the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support and further inhibit catalytic deactivation."
