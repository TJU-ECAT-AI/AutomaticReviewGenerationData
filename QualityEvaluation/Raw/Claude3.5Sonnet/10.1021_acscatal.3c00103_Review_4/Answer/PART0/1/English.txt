The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of calcium (Ca) as a support modification strategy can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

1. Acid strength and acidity:
- Ca suppresses strong acid sites on various supports (ZSM-5, Al2O3), leading to a sharp decrease in total acidity.
- This reduction in acidity helps prevent unwanted side reactions such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and deep dehydrogenation.
- The decrease in acid centers contributes to improved propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Chemical stability and alloy formation:
- Ca promotes the reduction of both Pt and Ge species, as well as accelerates Sn reduction.
- This results in a higher degree of alloy formation between the active metal (Pt) and promoters (Ge, Sn).
- Enhanced alloy formation leads to improved catalyst stability and selectivity.

3. Electronic properties:
- Ca donates electrons to Pt, resulting in a weaker interaction between Pt and propylene.
- This modification of electronic properties suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption.

4. Morphological characteristics:
- Ca addition increases Pt dispersion and prevents sintering of metal particles.
- It enhances the geometric modification of Pt, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation.

5. Desorption characteristics:
- Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption by shifting desorption temperatures to lower values.

6. Coke resistance:
- Ca-promoted catalysts show lower activity for coke formation and deactivation.
- The increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke facilitates its desorption.

7. Activation energy:
- Ca promotion can lead to higher activation energy for the main reaction, related to the enhanced reduction of promoter species (e.g., GeOx).

These modifications collectively contribute to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the balance between acidity, metal-support interactions, and resistance to deactivation. The result is improved propylene selectivity, increased catalyst stability, and reduced coke formation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study shows that Lewis acid sites, arising from defective AlIII sites in the Al2O3 structure, are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites positively correlates with the propane conversion rate, indicating that catalysts with more Lewis acid sites perform better.

The acid strength distribution (weak, moderate, and strong) also affects catalyst performance. NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR measurements reveal the presence and distribution of different types of acid sites in the catalysts, which impacts catalytic activity and selectivity.

Morphological characteristics, such as crystalline structure and surface area, influence catalyst performance. Different forms of Al2O3 (e.g., γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3) show varying levels of activity due to differences in their crystalline structures and the number of defective AlIII sites.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling crystalline structure: Tailoring synthesis conditions to promote specific Al2O3 phases (e.g., γ-Al2O3) with more defective AlIII sites.

2. Thermal treatment: Dehydrating Al2O3 at high temperatures (e.g., 700°C) to create more defective AlIII sites, thus increasing the number of Lewis acid sites.

3. Optimizing acid site distribution: Modifying preparation conditions to achieve an optimal balance between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, as well as weak, moderate, and strong acid sites.

4. Enhancing stability: Developing methods to reduce coke formation or improve the catalyst's resistance to deactivation, such as optimizing regeneration processes.

5. Surface area and porosity control: Adjusting textural properties to enhance the accessibility of active sites and improve mass transfer.

These strategies aim to maximize the number and accessibility of active Lewis acid sites while maintaining catalyst stability and selectivity, ultimately leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the presence of silanol nests, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Silanol nests are clusters of neighboring -SiOH groups associated with hydrogen bonding, which play a crucial role in catalyst performance by acting as Brønsted acid sites and promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.

Chemical qualities:
1. Acid strength: Silanol nests enhance catalytic efficiency and durability by promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.
2. Stability: The formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles, facilitated by silanol nests, improves the catalyst's stability and resistance to deactivation.

Morphological characteristics:
1. Mesoporous structure: Provides a confinement effect, leading to the formation of tiny metal nanoparticles and improved catalyst performance.
2. Particle size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to better catalytic performance due to increased surface area and metal dispersion.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Sodium-free synthesis: This approach spontaneously generates silanol nests in mesoporous MFI zeolites, promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles without the need for post-synthetic treatments.

2. Avoiding sodium-containing compounds: Even small amounts of sodium (e.g., NaCl) can significantly reduce the formation of silanol nests and negatively impact catalytic performance.

3. Control of metal loading: Optimizing the metal loading (e.g., 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y) can balance the benefits of increased active sites with the potential drawbacks of larger particle sizes at higher loadings.

4. Direct synthesis methods: Techniques that generate silanol nests during the initial zeolite synthesis, rather than through post-synthetic treatments, can lead to improved catalytic properties.

5. Mesopore generation: Creating a hierarchical pore structure with both micropores and mesopores can enhance the distribution of active sites and improve mass transfer.

By carefully controlling these factors, particularly the generation of silanol nests through sodium-free synthesis, it is possible to create catalysts with enhanced efficiency and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. The presence and effectiveness of silanol nests can be confirmed through IR and NMR spectroscopies. When properly implemented, this support modification strategy can lead to remarkably long catalytic lifetimes (up to 20 days) with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

While the literature does not provide specific information about dehydrogenation reactions or detailed chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, it does discuss how the morphological characteristics of hierarchical zeolites influence catalytic performance in general.

Hierarchical zeolites combine microporous structures with secondary meso- and macroporosity, which enhances mass transport while maintaining molecular sieving ability. This improved structure addresses mass transport limitations found in conventional zeolites, allowing better access for reagents to reach active sites within micropores. This can lead to increased reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetimes.

The secondary porosity in hierarchical zeolites also provides space for depositing active catalytic phases, allowing control over their size and achieving high dispersion. This structure promotes strong interactions between the zeolite and the reaction medium.

While the text doesn't mention specific support modification strategies, the creation of hierarchical structures with secondary porosity can be considered a strategy to optimize catalytic properties. This modification enhances mass transport and accessibility to active sites, which could potentially improve efficiency and selectivity in various catalytic reactions, including dehydrogenation, though this specific reaction is not mentioned in the given literature.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between the metal (Cr) and the support (HZSM-5) contribute to the stability and activity of the catalyst, as shown by XPS studies.

5. Support composition: The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support affects the acidity and thus the catalytic performance. Higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratios generally lead to lower acidity, as demonstrated by NH3-TPD studies.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 to achieve suitable acidity and optimal balance between activity and selectivity.

2. Using high-silica HZSM-5 (e.g., SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) to provide moderate acidity and high stability.

3. Optimizing the metal loading to achieve high dispersion of active Cr species while avoiding the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

By carefully tuning these physicochemical properties through support modification, catalysts can be designed to exhibit enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability are crucial for catalyst performance. The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal and hydrothermal stability, as well as strong acidity. These properties are important for many catalytic applications, including dehydrogenation reactions. The stability of the catalyst is demonstrated by the retention of approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al in the zeolite framework even after exposure to harsh conditions.

Morphological characteristics also play a vital role in catalytic performance. The MFI nanosheets showed higher catalytic activities compared to conventional MFI zeolite due to their unique structure. The nanosheets have a large number of acid sites located on the external surface (mesopore surface), which increases their accessibility to reactant molecules. The unilamellar MFI, with its larger external surface area after calcination, exhibited even higher activities.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be inferred:

1. Reducing crystal thickness: By synthesizing ultrathin zeolites (nanosheets), the diffusion path lengths are reduced, improving molecular diffusion and catalytic activity.

2. Increasing external surface area: Creating structures with larger external surface areas, such as unilamellar nanosheets, can provide more accessible active sites.

   - High surface area of mesoporous zeolites contributes to improved catalytic performance.
   - Small particle size decreases diffusion path length, providing more readily accessible active sites for reactions involving large molecules.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Creating intercrystalline mesopores in zeolites to enhance diffusion and reduce mass transfer limitations.
2. Increasing the external surface area of zeolites to improve accessibility to active sites.
3. Dispersing metal active centers throughout the porous network structure to optimize catalytic efficiency.
4. Developing nanocomposite materials based on zeolites to further enhance catalytic properties.
5. Controlling particle size to produce smaller zeolite particles with shorter diffusion path lengths.
6. Tailoring pore structure to create well-connected pore networks combining micropores and mesopores to optimize diffusion properties.

These modifications result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity, and reduced catalyst deactivation in both vapor phase and liquid phase reactions. The optimized physicochemical properties facilitate better molecular transport, increased accessibility to active sites, and improved electron transfer, all contributing to superior catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by improving thermal stability, reducing unwanted side reactions, optimizing the distribution and stability of active metal particles, and tailoring the electronic properties of active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Key findings include:

1. Alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, altering their acidities without changing the textural properties. This is evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy.

3. Alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K) weaken the acidic properties of open Zr Lewis sites, with different ions having varying effects on catalytic activity (Li+ > Na+ > K+).

4. The concentration of alkali metal hydroxide used in the treatment is crucial. An optimal concentration (around 0.025 M) improves catalytic performance, while excessive concentrations can decrease Lewis acidity or even convert sites to basic ones.

5. Homogeneous distribution of zirconium and alkali metal species throughout the catalyst is achieved, as shown by HAADF-STEM and EDX analysis.

6. The alkaline treatment reduces carbon deposition, improving catalyst stability and reusability.

7. Various characterization techniques (XRD, N2 sorption isotherms, FTIR, XPS) were used to study the effects of alkaline treatment on catalyst structure and properties.

These modifications result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity towards desired products, and increased resistance to deactivation through carbon deposition. The optimized catalysts show better performance in reactions such as the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural, demonstrating higher yields of desired products and improved stability over multiple reaction cycles.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of calcium (Ca) as a support modification strategy can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity:

1. Acid strength and acidity:

- This modification of electronic properties suppresses deep dehydrogenation and facilitates coke desorption.

4. Morphological characteristics:
- Ca addition increases Pt dispersion and prevents sintering of metal particles.
- It enhances the geometric modification of Pt, reducing its ability for cracking and coke formation.

5. Desorption characteristics:
- Ca addition facilitates propylene desorption by shifting desorption temperatures to lower values.

6. Coke resistance:

- The increased H/C ratio of H-deficient coke facilitates its desorption.

7. Activation energy:
- Ca promotion can lead to higher activation energy for the main reaction, related to the enhanced reduction of promoter species (e.g., GeOx).

These modifications collectively contribute to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the balance between acidity, metal-support interactions, and resistance to deactivation. The result is improved propylene selectivity, increased catalyst stability, and reduced coke formation.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study shows that Lewis acid sites, arising from defective AlIII sites in the Al2O3 structure, are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The amount of Lewis acid sites positively correlates with the propane conversion rate, indicating that catalysts with more Lewis acid sites perform better.

The acid strength distribution (weak, moderate, and strong) also affects catalyst performance. NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR measurements reveal the presence and distribution of different types of acid sites in the catalysts, which impacts catalytic activity and selectivity.

Morphological characteristics, such as crystalline structure and surface area, influence catalyst performance. Different forms of Al2O3 (e.g., γ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3) show varying levels of activity due to differences in their crystalline structures and the number of defective AlIII sites.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling crystalline structure: Tailoring synthesis conditions to promote specific Al2O3 phases (e.g., γ-Al2O3) with more defective AlIII sites.

2. Thermal treatment: Dehydrating Al2O3 at high temperatures (e.g., 700°C) to create more defective AlIII sites, thus increasing the number of Lewis acid sites.

3. Optimizing acid site distribution: Modifying preparation conditions to achieve an optimal balance between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, as well as weak, moderate, and strong acid sites.

4. Enhancing stability: Developing methods to reduce coke formation or improve the catalyst's resistance to deactivation, such as optimizing regeneration processes.

These strategies aim to maximize the number and accessibility of active Lewis acid sites while maintaining catalyst stability and selectivity, ultimately leading to improved performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the presence of silanol nests, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Silanol nests are clusters of neighboring -SiOH groups associated with hydrogen bonding, which play a crucial role in catalyst performance by acting as Brønsted acid sites and promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.

Chemical qualities:
1. Acid strength: Silanol nests enhance catalytic efficiency and durability by promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles.

Morphological characteristics:
1. Mesoporous structure: Provides a confinement effect, leading to the formation of tiny metal nanoparticles and improved catalyst performance.
2. Particle size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to better catalytic performance due to increased surface area and metal dispersion.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Sodium-free synthesis: This approach spontaneously generates silanol nests in mesoporous MFI zeolites, promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles without the need for post-synthetic treatments.

2. Avoiding sodium-containing compounds: Even small amounts of sodium (e.g., NaCl) can significantly reduce the formation of silanol nests and negatively impact catalytic performance.

3. Control of metal loading: Optimizing the metal loading (e.g., 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y) can balance the benefits of increased active sites with the potential drawbacks of larger particle sizes at higher loadings.

4. Direct synthesis methods: Techniques that generate silanol nests during the initial zeolite synthesis, rather than through post-synthetic treatments, can lead to improved catalytic properties.

5. Mesopore generation: Creating a hierarchical pore structure with both micropores and mesopores can enhance the distribution of active sites and improve mass transfer.

By carefully controlling these factors, particularly the generation of silanol nests through sodium-free synthesis, it is possible to create catalysts with enhanced efficiency and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. The presence and effectiveness of silanol nests can be confirmed through IR and NMR spectroscopies. When properly implemented, this support modification strategy can lead to remarkably long catalytic lifetimes (up to 20 days) with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

While the literature does not provide specific information about dehydrogenation reactions or detailed chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, it does discuss how the morphological characteristics of hierarchical zeolites influence catalytic performance in general.

Hierarchical zeolites combine microporous structures with secondary meso- and macroporosity, which enhances mass transport while maintaining molecular sieving ability. This improved structure addresses mass transport limitations found in conventional zeolites, allowing better access for reagents to reach active sites within micropores. This can lead to increased reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetimes.

The secondary porosity in hierarchical zeolites also provides space for depositing active catalytic phases, allowing control over their size and achieving high dispersion. This structure promotes strong interactions between the zeolite and the reaction medium.

While the text doesn't mention specific support modification strategies, the creation of hierarchical structures with secondary porosity can be considered a strategy to optimize catalytic properties. This modification enhances mass transport and accessibility to active sites, which could potentially improve efficiency and selectivity in various catalytic reactions, including dehydrogenation, though this specific reaction is not mentioned in the given literature.

By carefully tuning these physicochemical properties through support modification, catalysts can be designed to exhibit enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability are crucial for catalyst performance. The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal and hydrothermal stability, as well as strong acidity. These properties are important for many catalytic applications, including dehydrogenation reactions. The stability of the catalyst is demonstrated by the retention of approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al in the zeolite framework even after exposure to harsh conditions.

Morphological characteristics also play a vital role in catalytic performance. The MFI nanosheets showed higher catalytic activities compared to conventional MFI zeolite due to their unique structure. The nanosheets have a large number of acid sites located on the external surface (mesopore surface), which increases their accessibility to reactant molecules. The unilamellar MFI, with its larger external surface area after calcination, exhibited even higher activities.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be inferred:

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support affects the electronic properties of supported platinum, with increasing acidity leading to greater alterations in platinum properties. This is evidenced by changes in platinum binding energy and CO adsorption frequency.

Conversely, the presence of platinum modifies the acidic properties of the support by reducing the strength of acid sites.

          6. Maintaining high external surface acid site concentrations.

          These strategies collectively aim to optimize the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, enhancing its performance in dehydrogenation reactions by improving Pt dispersion, catalyst stability, and overall catalytic efficiency.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

These strategies aim to balance various physicochemical properties to achieve optimal catalyst performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
   - Acid strength and stability are crucial for catalytic activity. Mesoporous zeolites exhibit higher catalytic activity in acid-catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity.
   - The presence of metal active centers dispersed in the porous zeolite network enhances catalytic efficiency.

2. Morphological characteristics:
   - Pore size and structure are critical. Conventional microporous zeolites have limitations due to small channel sizes (less than 8 Å) and cavities (typically <15 Å), which impose diffusion constraints for large organic molecules.
   - Mesoporous zeolites overcome this limitation, allowing enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules.
   - High surface area of mesoporous zeolites contributes to improved catalytic performance.
   - Small particle size decreases diffusion path length, providing more readily accessible active sites for reactions involving large molecules.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Creating intercrystalline mesopores in zeolites to enhance diffusion and reduce mass transfer limitations.
2. Increasing the external surface area of zeolites to improve accessibility to active sites.
3. Dispersing metal active centers throughout the porous network structure to optimize catalytic efficiency.
4. Developing nanocomposite materials based on zeolites to further enhance catalytic properties.
5. Controlling particle size to produce smaller zeolite particles with shorter diffusion path lengths.
6. Tailoring pore structure to create well-connected pore networks combining micropores and mesopores to optimize diffusion properties.

These modifications result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity, and reduced catalyst deactivation in both vapor phase and liquid phase reactions. The optimized physicochemical properties facilitate better molecular transport, increased accessibility to active sites, and improved electron transfer, all contributing to superior catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Thermal stability: Supports must withstand harsh hydrothermal conditions during regeneration.

2. Acidity: Limited support acidity is crucial to prevent side reactions like coke formation and alkane isomerization.

3. Surface area and pore structure: Large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are important for optimal distribution of metallic particles.

4. Chemical composition: Different supports affect the activity and selectivity of active species (e.g., oligomeric chromium oxide on γ-alumina vs. isolated chromia species on SBA-15).

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between the carrier and active phase impacts catalyst activity and selectivity.

6. Mechanical strength: This property contributes to catalyst durability.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adding alkaline metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) to poison acid sites, suppress coke formation, and modify platinum properties.

2. Doping with Zn or Mg to create less acidic and more thermally stable spinel phases, which also reduce platinum sintering.

3. Using mixed oxides (e.g., molybdenum-magnesium) to balance acidity and improve selectivity.

4. Adding larger cations (e.g., La3+) to prevent undesirable phase transitions and maintain high surface area.

5. Optimizing preparation methods to achieve high dopant dispersion and desired support properties.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by improving thermal stability, reducing unwanted side reactions, optimizing the distribution and stability of active metal particles, and tailoring the electronic properties of active sites.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses how alkaline treatment of Zr-Al-Beta zeolites can be used as a support modification strategy to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Key findings include:

1. Alkaline treatment modifies both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, altering their acidities without changing the textural properties. This is evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy.

2. The treatment transforms some Brønsted acid sites into Lewis acid sites while suppressing overall Lewis acidity.

3. Alkali metal ions (Li, Na, K) weaken the acidic properties of open Zr Lewis sites, with different ions having varying effects on catalytic activity (Li+ > Na+ > K+).

4. The concentration of alkali metal hydroxide used in the treatment is crucial. An optimal concentration (around 0.025 M) improves catalytic performance, while excessive concentrations can decrease Lewis acidity or even convert sites to basic ones.

5. Homogeneous distribution of zirconium and alkali metal species throughout the catalyst is achieved, as shown by HAADF-STEM and EDX analysis.

6. The alkaline treatment reduces carbon deposition, improving catalyst stability and reusability.

7. Various characterization techniques (XRD, N2 sorption isotherms, FTIR, XPS) were used to study the effects of alkaline treatment on catalyst structure and properties.

These modifications result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity towards desired products, and increased resistance to deactivation through carbon deposition. The optimized catalysts show better performance in reactions such as the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of furfural, demonstrating higher yields of desired products and improved stability over multiple reaction cycles.

   - Increasing external surface area to improve mass transport.

3. Porosity Regulation:
   - Creating hierarchical structures with both micro and meso-level porosity.
   - Combining fast transport properties with high hydrothermal stability.
   - Using top-down (post-treatment) or bottom-up (templating) methods for synthesis.

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability by tailoring the physicochemical properties of the catalyst support to enhance diffusion efficiency, provide appropriate acidity, and maintain structural integrity under reaction conditions.
