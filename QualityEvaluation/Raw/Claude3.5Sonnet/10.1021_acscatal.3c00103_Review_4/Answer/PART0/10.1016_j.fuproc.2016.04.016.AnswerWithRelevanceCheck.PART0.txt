          [1] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[2] "Less acidic supports such as zinc and magnesium aluminates are becoming popular support materials because they require no alkali titration of acidic sites."

[3] "Mesoporous supports give higher space-time yields because of their high surface area"

[4] "The nature and interaction of vanadium with the support determines the nature of the predominant VOx structure."

[5] "Titration of the acid site of support with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[6] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation. The influence of tin on platinum performance can be electronic or geometric."

[7] "The extent of PtSn interactions depends on the impregnation sequence of Pt and Sn precursors on the support material. Co-impregnation will result in greater PtSn interaction than if precursors are impregnated sequentially."

[8] "Microporous zeolites are structurally defined framework materials that may constitute a good starting point for obtaining more precise information on the properties-performance correlation of dehydrogenation catalysts."

[9] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[10] "VOx sites with more than four oxygen ligands are more active but less selective than tetrahedral VO4 species. Isolated VOx sites are selective but less active than V sites connected via VOV bonds"

[11] "Modification of Al2O3 with MgO supports used in the ODH of propane over VOx increases propene selectivity. Based on the beneficial effect of MgO addition to Al2O3, Evans et al., reasoned that VOx/MgAl2O4 should exhibit improved selectivity compared VOx/Al2O3 and MgO-modified VOx/Al2O3. They obtained 95% propene selectivity with a monolayer VOx coverage on MgAl2O4."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties include:

1. Chemical qualities:
   - Acid strength: Strong acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like cracking and coking. Titration of acid sites with alkali or using less acidic supports like zinc and magnesium aluminates can improve selectivity.
   - Stability: The stability of active metal species depends on their interaction with the support. For example, promoting platinum with tin improves its stability for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. Morphological characteristics:
   - Surface area: Mesoporous supports provide higher space-time yields due to their high surface area.
   - Porosity: Microporous zeolites offer structurally defined frameworks for better understanding of properties-performance correlations.
   - Active site structure: The coordination environment of active sites (e.g., VOx) affects activity and selectivity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Acid site management: Titrating acidic sites with alkali or using inherently less acidic supports.
2. Promoter addition: Adding promoters like tin to platinum catalysts to enhance performance through electronic or geometric effects.
3. Impregnation techniques: Co-impregnation of metal precursors (e.g., Pt and Sn) for greater interaction.
4. Support material selection and modification: Using mixed oxide supports (e.g., MgAl2O4) or modifying supports (e.g., adding MgO to Al2O3) to improve selectivity.
5. Controlling metal loading and dispersion: Optimizing surface density and coverage of active species.

These strategies aim to balance activity and selectivity by tailoring the acid-base properties, metal-support interactions, and overall surface chemistry of the catalyst. The goal is to create an environment that favors the desired dehydrogenation reaction while minimizing side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。这些性质包括：

1. 化学性质：
   - 酸强度：强酸性可能导致不希望的副反应，如裂解和结焦。用碱滴定酸性位点或使用较低酸性的载体（如锌和镁铝酸盐）可以提高选择性。
   - 稳定性：活性金属物种的稳定性取决于它们与载体的相互作用。例如，用锡促进铂可以提高其在烷烃脱氢中的稳定性。

2. 形态特征：
   - 比表面积：介孔载体由于其高比表面积提供更高的空时产率。
   - 孔隙率：微孔沸石提供结构明确的框架，有助于更好地理解性能与性质之间的关系。
   - 活性位点结构：活性位点（如VOx）的配位环境影响活性和选择性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 酸性位点管理：用碱滴定酸性位点或使用本质上酸性较低的载体。
2. 添加促进剂：向铂催化剂中添加锡等促进剂，通过电子或几何效应增强性能。
3. 浸渍技术：金属前体（如Pt和Sn）的共浸渍以获得更强的相互作用。
4. 载体材料选择和改性：使用混合氧化物载体（如MgAl2O4）或改性载体（如向Al2O3添加MgO）以提高选择性。
5. 控制金属负载和分散：优化活性物种的表面密度和覆盖度。

这些策略旨在通过调整催化剂的酸碱性质、金属-载体相互作用和整体表面化学性质，平衡活性和选择性。目标是创造一个有利于所需脱氢反应的环境，同时最大限度地减少副反应和催化剂失活。
