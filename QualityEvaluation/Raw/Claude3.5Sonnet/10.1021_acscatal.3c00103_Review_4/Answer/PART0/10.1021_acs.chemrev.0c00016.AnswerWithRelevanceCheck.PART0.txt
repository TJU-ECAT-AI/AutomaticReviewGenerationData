          "The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."

"Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions."

"The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice."

"The larger mesopores allow bulky reactants to access the catalytic sites within the zeolite crystals, thereby promoting the primary reactions to yield more gasoline and LCO."

"The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites."

"Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."

"The catalytic activity of the catalysts increased as their mesoporous volume and the accessible surface area increased."

"The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment."

"The hierarchical zeolites exhibit slower deactivation of the active sites, shorter retention time of products in the micropores, and less secondary coke product formation."

"The large external surface area and tunable surface properties have received much interest."

"The effective improvement of CO2 adsorption mainly originated from the large surface area, which promoted the CO2 adsorption capacity."

"The mesopores thus serve as hosts for large biological molecules or metal complexes."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics (such as pore size, pore connectivity, and surface area), significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Accessibility of active sites: Strongly correlated with pore size and connectivity in zeolites.
2. Hierarchical porosity: Abundant meso- or macropores directly accessible from the outer surface enhance catalytic performance.
3. Mesoporosity: Allows bulky molecules to access internal active sites, improving overall accessibility.
4. Diffusion path: Meso- and macropores shorten the diffusion path to internal active sites, benefiting interactions with bulky molecules.
5. Surface area: Larger accessible surface area typically leads to increased catalytic activity.
6. Deactivation rate: Hierarchical structures exhibit slower deactivation of active sites.
7. Product retention: Shorter retention time of products in micropores, potentially reducing unwanted secondary reactions.
8. Coke formation: Less secondary coke product formation in hierarchical structures.
9. Surface chemistry: Modifications like desilication can create new surface features influencing adsorption capacity and catalytic properties.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Introduction of mesoporosity or macroporosity: Creating hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores.
2. Pore size engineering: Designing catalysts with larger mesopores to accommodate bulky reactants.
3. Enhancing pore connectivity: Developing zeolites with well-connected pore networks.
4. Surface modification: Creating additional access points for reactants on the outer surface of zeolite crystals.
5. Hierarchical structuring: Developing multi-level porous systems (micro-meso-macroporous).
6. Controlled desilication or dealumination: To create additional porosity and modify acid site distribution.
7. Template-assisted synthesis: Using specific templates during zeolite synthesis to control pore structure and crystal size.
8. Post-synthesis treatments: Various treatments like steaming or acid leaching to modify porosity and acid site distribution.
9. Metal incorporation: Adding metals to introduce new active sites and modify catalyst selectivity.
10. Surface functionalization: Modifying surface chemistry to enhance catalyst-reactant interactions and tune acid-base properties.

These strategies aim to overcome diffusion limitations, increase the number of accessible active sites, and improve overall catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions involving bulky molecules.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征（如孔径、孔隙连通性和表面积），对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。关键因素包括：

1. 活性位点的可及性：与沸石中的孔径和连通性强相关。
2. 分级孔隙结构：直接从外表面可及的丰富介孔或大孔可以增强催化性能。
3. 介孔性：允许大分子进入内部活性位点，提高整体可及性。
4. 扩散路径：介孔和大孔缩短了到内部活性位点的扩散路径，有利于与大分子的相互作用。
5. 表面积：较大的可及表面积通常会导致催化活性增加。
6. 失活速率：分级结构表现出较慢的活性位点失活。
7. 产物滞留：产物在微孔中的滞留时间缩短，可能减少不需要的二次反应。
8. 积炭形成：分级结构中二次积炭产物形成减少。
9. 表面化学：如脱硅等改性可以创造影响吸附能力和催化性能的新表面特征。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种载体改性策略：

1. 引入介孔或大孔：创建具有丰富介孔或大孔的分级多孔沸石。
2. 孔径工程：设计具有较大介孔的催化剂，以容纳大体积反应物。
3. 增强孔隙连通性：开发具有良好连通孔隙网络的沸石。
4. 表面改性：在沸石晶体的外表面创造反应物的额外进入点。
5. 分级结构化：开发多级孔系统（微孔-介孔-大孔）。
6. 控制脱硅或脱铝：创造额外的孔隙度并修改酸性位点分布。
7. 模板辅助合成：在沸石合成过程中使用特定模板控制孔结构和晶体尺寸。
8. 后合成处理：蒸汽处理或酸浸等各种处理，以修改孔隙度和酸性位点分布。
9. 金属引入：添加金属引入新的活性位点并修改催化剂选择性。
10. 表面功能化：修改表面化学性质以增强催化剂-反应物相互作用并调节酸碱性。

这些策略旨在克服扩散限制，增加可及活性位点的数量，并提高涉及大分子的脱氢反应的整体催化效率和选择性。
