          [1] "The textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts."

[2] "Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price."

[3] "Additionally, doping can also help increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al."

[4] "Although acidic supports are also undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg. It is revealed that the amount of acidic sites of CrZrO catalysts is reduced for K (0.2%, 0.5%, or 1%) doping, leading to an enhanced C3H6 selectivity and resistance to coke formation in PDH reaction."

[5] "The acidbase pairs of metal oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are deactivated owing to coke deposition, and as for Pt-based catalysts, periodical regeneration become indispensable."

[6] "Although metal oxides (such as Al2O3 and ZrO2) have been widely studied as supports for CrOx and VOx catalysts, the stability is still too low due to the strong acidity of supports."

[7] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."

[8] "An appropriate promoter that improves the overall activity, selectivity, and anti-coking capability is still under discovery."

[9] "Doping with another component could inhibit the transformation process. For example, B. Ersoy et al. observed that the addition of La2O3 to solgel derived alumina gels increased the γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 transformation temperature to 1200 C."

[10] "The acidic sites are undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg."

[11] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI"

[12] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."

[13] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."

[14] "The supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[15] "Experimental evidence indicated that appropriate Mg addition promotes the dispersion of V2O5 nanoparticles from three dimensional to two dimensional VOx species which extremely reduce coke deposition and then enhance stability on a large scale."

[16] "Differing from metal-based catalysts, the Lewis acid MO sites in metal oxides can also effectively activate the propane CH bonds."

[17] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it. Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."

[18] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Surface area: High surface area supports (e.g., alumina) provide better dispersion of active sites, enhancing catalytic performance.

2. Acidity: Strong acidity can lead to undesirable side reactions and lower stability. Modifying acidity through doping with alkali metals (K, Na, Ca, Mg) can improve selectivity and reduce coke formation.

3. Thermal stability: Materials with excellent thermal stability (e.g., alumina) help maintain catalyst structure and activity under high-temperature conditions.

4. Mechanical strength: Suitable mechanical strength ensures catalyst durability in industrial applications.

5. Metal-support interactions: Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can enhance catalyst stability and performance.

6. Dispersion of active sites: Better dispersion of active metal or metal oxide species improves catalytic efficiency.

7. Pore structure: Uniform pore size distribution is preferred for optimal mass transfer and catalyst performance.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Doping with alkali metals to neutralize acidity and improve selectivity.
2. Incorporating other metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, CeO2) to enhance metal-support interactions and improve activity, stability, and coking resistance.
3. Adding stabilizing elements (e.g., La2O3) to inhibit undesirable phase transformations and maintain desired crystal structures at higher temperatures.
4. Using promoters to improve overall activity, selectivity, and anti-coking capability.
5. Modifying supports to enhance the dispersion and electronic properties of active metal species.
6. Employing confinement strategies to prevent sintering of metal clusters.

These strategies aim to balance various physicochemical properties to achieve optimal catalyst performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.
