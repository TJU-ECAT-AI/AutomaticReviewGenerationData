          [1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

[2] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

[4] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

[5] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at the micro and meso levels exhibit fast transport and relatively high hydrothermal stability, combining catalytic properties of microporous and mesoporous zeolites."

[6] "The introduction of an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal is an effective approach to balance the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support and further inhibit catalytic deactivation."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
   - Acid strength and stability affect selectivity towards the targeted alkene.
   - Proper acidity is crucial for C-H activation and propylene desorption.
   - Excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like C-C cracking and deep dehydrogenation.
   - Hydrothermal and pH stability impact overall catalyst performance.

2. Morphological characteristics:
   - Influence the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products.
   - Determined by the catalyst's morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties.
   - Affect mass transport properties and accessibility of active sites.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Acidity Adjustment:
   - Introducing alkali or alkaline-earth metals to balance strong acidity.
   - Dealumination to reduce Brønsted acid sites in zeolites.
   - Ion-exchange methods to modify acidity.

2. Morphology Regulation:
   - Developing nanosized supports.
   - Synthesizing supports with specific morphologies (e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, mesh-shaped structures).
   - Increasing external surface area to improve mass transport.

3. Porosity Regulation:
   - Creating hierarchical structures with both micro and meso-level porosity.
   - Combining fast transport properties with high hydrothermal stability.
   - Using top-down (post-treatment) or bottom-up (templating) methods for synthesis.

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability by tailoring the physicochemical properties of the catalyst support to enhance diffusion efficiency, provide appropriate acidity, and maintain structural integrity under reaction conditions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
   - 酸强度和稳定性影响对目标烯烃的选择性。
   - 适当的酸度对C-H活化和丙烯脱附至关重要。
   - 过度的酸度可能导致不希望的副反应，如C-C断裂和深度脱氢。
   - 水热和pH稳定性影响催化剂的整体性能。

2. 形态特征：
   - 影响反应物和产物的扩散效率。
   - 由催化剂的形态、结构、尺寸和化学性质决定。
   - 影响物质传输性能和活性位点的可及性。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种支持体改性策略：

1. 酸度调节：
   - 引入碱金属或碱土金属来平衡强酸性。
   - 对沸石进行脱铝以减少Brønsted酸位。
   - 使用离子交换方法来修改酸度。

2. 形态调控：
   - 开发纳米尺寸的支持体。
   - 合成特定形态的支持体（如针状、片状、网状结构）。
   - 增加外部表面积以改善物质传输。

3. 孔隙度调节：
   - 创建具有微观和介观级孔隙度的层级结构。
   - 结合快速传输特性和高水热稳定性。
   - 使用自上而下（后处理）或自下而上（模板法）的合成方法。

这些策略旨在通过调整催化剂支持体的物理化学性质来优化催化活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡，以增强扩散效率，提供适当的酸度，并在反应条件下维持结构完整性。
