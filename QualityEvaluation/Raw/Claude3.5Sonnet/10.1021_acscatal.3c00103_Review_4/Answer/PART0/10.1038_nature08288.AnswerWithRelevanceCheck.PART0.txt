          "The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications."

"27Al magic-angle spinning NMR spectra indicated that approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al was retained in the zeolite framework even after being heated in 100% steam at 700C (Supplementary Fig. 5)."

"The catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1). These enhanced catalytic activities can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (that is, on the external surface of the zeolite layer) of MFI nanosheets, with the unilamellar MFI generally exhibiting higher activities owing to its larger external surface area after calcination."

"Another remarkable feature of the MFI nanosheets is their increased catalyst lifetime, which manifested itself when we investigated the catalytic properties of MFI zeolites in methanol-to-gasoline conversion."

"We therefore propose that the long catalytic lifetime of the MFI nanosheets is due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external zeolite surfaces, which arises because of facile mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability are crucial for catalyst performance. The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal and hydrothermal stability, as well as strong acidity. These properties are important for many catalytic applications, including dehydrogenation reactions. The stability of the catalyst is demonstrated by the retention of approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al in the zeolite framework even after exposure to harsh conditions.

Morphological characteristics also play a vital role in catalytic performance. The MFI nanosheets showed higher catalytic activities compared to conventional MFI zeolite due to their unique structure. The nanosheets have a large number of acid sites located on the external surface (mesopore surface), which increases their accessibility to reactant molecules. The unilamellar MFI, with its larger external surface area after calcination, exhibited even higher activities.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be inferred:

1. Reducing crystal thickness: By synthesizing ultrathin zeolites (nanosheets), the diffusion path lengths are reduced, improving molecular diffusion and catalytic activity.

2. Increasing external surface area: Creating structures with larger external surface areas, such as unilamellar nanosheets, can provide more accessible active sites.

3. Controlling pore structure: Designing catalysts with both micropores and mesopores can balance molecular sieving effects with improved diffusion of reactants and products.

4. Tailoring acidity: Maintaining strong acidity while ensuring stability under reaction conditions is crucial for sustained catalytic performance.

5. Optimizing coke formation patterns: Designing catalysts that promote coke formation on external surfaces rather than within micropores can extend catalyst lifetime.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on dehydrogenation reactions, these principles can be applied to optimize catalysts for such reactions, potentially leading to improved efficiency and selectivity.

          催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性对催化剂性能至关重要。MFI纳米片表现出优异的热稳定性和水热稳定性，以及强酸性。这些性质对许多催化应用（包括脱氢反应）都很重要。催化剂的稳定性通过在苛刻条件下仍保留约50%的初始四面体铝在沸石骨架中得到证明。

形态特征也在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用。由于其独特的结构，MFI纳米片与传统MFI沸石相比表现出更高的催化活性。纳米片在外表面（介孔表面）有大量酸性位点，增加了反应分子的可及性。单层MFI由于煅烧后具有更大的外表面积，表现出更高的活性。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以推断出几种支持物修饰策略：

1. 减少晶体厚度：通过合成超薄沸石（纳米片），可以减少扩散路径长度，改善分子扩散和催化活性。

2. 增加外表面积：创建具有更大外表面积的结构，如单层纳米片，可以提供更多可接触的活性位点。

3. 控制孔结构：设计同时具有微孔和介孔的催化剂，可以平衡分子筛选效应和改善反应物及产物的扩散。

4. 调整酸度：在反应条件下保持强酸性的同时确保稳定性，对于持续的催化性能至关重要。

5. 优化焦炭形成模式：设计促进焦炭在外表面而非微孔内形成的催化剂，可以延长催化剂寿命。

虽然该研究并未特别关注脱氢反应，但这些原理可以应用于优化脱氢反应的催化剂，可能导致效率和选择性的提高。
