          [1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "The diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[4] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."

[5] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction"

[6] "In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene"

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions.
- Stability: Al2O3 is widely used as a support due to its structural stability, which helps maintain catalyst performance over time.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface structure: Coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on γ-Al2O3 act as anchor points for dispersing active metal sites.
- Nanosheet morphology: γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can effectively disperse and stabilize metal nanoclusters.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Tailoring surface acidity: Controlling the density and strength of acid sites on Al2O3 can improve propane activation while minimizing side reactions and coke formation.

2. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Creating strong interactions between the metal and Al2O3 support can improve metal dispersion and stability.

3. Developing nanostructured supports: Synthesizing Al2O3 with specific morphologies (e.g., nanosheets) can increase the availability of desirable surface sites for metal anchoring.

4. Modifying surface chemistry: Eliminating hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 can create coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites that act as active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Creating specific interactions: For example, the interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows for high dispersion of tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, enhancing activity and stability.

6. Employing controlled synthesis methods: Using techniques like one-step hydrothermal synthesis to create sheet-shaped catalysts can improve catalytic performance.

By employing these strategies, researchers can optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts to enhance their efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度：低配位Al位点的表面酸度影响丙烷在PDH反应中的吸附、活化和积碳沉积。
- 稳定性：Al2O3由于其结构稳定性而被广泛用作载体，有助于长期维持催化剂性能。

2. 形态特征：
- 表面结构：γ-Al2O3上的配位不饱和Al3+位点作为分散活性金属位点的锚点。
- 纳米片形态：具有五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片可以有效分散和稳定金属纳米簇。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 调整表面酸性：控制Al2O3上酸位点的密度和强度可以改善丙烷活化，同时最小化副反应和积碳形成。

2. 增强金属-载体相互作用：在金属和Al2O3载体之间创造强相互作用可以改善金属分散性和稳定性。

3. 开发纳米结构载体：合成具有特定形态（如纳米片）的Al2O3可以增加用于金属锚定的理想表面位点的可用性。

4. 修改表面化学：消除Al2O3上的羟基可以创造配位不饱和的Al3+位点，作为脱氢反应的活性位点。

5. 创造特定相互作用：例如，Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子高度分散，提高活性和稳定性。

6. 采用可控合成方法：使用一步水热合成等技术制造片状催化剂可以提高催化性能。

通过采用这些策略，研究人员可以优化催化剂的物理化学性质，以提高其在脱氢反应中的效率和选择性。
