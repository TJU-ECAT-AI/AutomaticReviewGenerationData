          [1] "There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption."

[2] "Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin."

[3] "TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst."

[4] "For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime."

[5] "The UVvis spectra for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3f) reveal equivalent internal coke between seed and finned samples; however, there is a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke for the finned sample, which suggests the presence of external protrusions leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths."

[6] "Analogous to studies by Ryoo and co-workers10, who showed that hierarchical zeolites that possess a high external surface area markedly reduce external coking, we demonstrate a similar effect for finned catalysts, and focus on two common 3D medium-pore zeolites: ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework)."

[7] "To substantiate the enhanced mass-transport properties of zeolites after secondary growth, we assessed the performance of the acid-exchanged (H-form) seed and finned samples in the MTH reaction at subcomplete methanol conversion (6090%)."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in catalytic reactions. While the provided literature does not specifically address dehydrogenation reactions, it offers insights into how morphological modifications can enhance catalytic performance, which may be applicable to various types of reactions, including dehydrogenation.

Morphological characteristics:
1. Nanosized zeolites with reduced internal diffusion limitations show enhanced performance in catalysis and adsorption.
2. Finned zeolite structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals, improving mass transport properties.
3. The finned structure allows reactions to occur both on the exterior protrusions and within the interior of the catalyst.
4. Increased external surface area in finned and hierarchical zeolites reduces external coking.

Chemical qualities:
1. Acid-exchanged (H-form) zeolites play a crucial role in catalytic activity.
2. Both seed and finned samples of H-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-5 showed similar initial catalyst activity, indicating preserved acid site accessibility.

Support modification strategies:
1. Introduction of fins on zeolite crystals:
   a. Improves mass transport properties
   b. Reduces internal diffusion limitations
   c. Extends catalyst lifetime (approximately threefold reduction in deactivation rate)
   d. Reduces external coke formation
   e. Maintains catalyst activity throughout the structure

These findings suggest that modifying the support structure of zeolite catalysts by introducing fins is an effective strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties. This approach enhances mass transport, reduces coking, extends catalyst lifetime, and maintains acid site accessibility, all of which may contribute to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity in various reactions, potentially including dehydrogenation reactions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，显著影响其在催化反应中的性能。虽然所提供的文献并未特别提及脱氢反应，但它提供了关于形态修饰如何增强催化性能的见解，这可能适用于各种类型的反应，包括脱氢反应。

形态特征：
1. 具有减少内部扩散限制的纳米级沸石在催化和吸附方面表现出增强的性能。
2. 鳍状沸石结构表现为伪纳米晶体，改善了传质性能。
3. 鳍状结构允许反应同时在外部突起和催化剂内部发生。
4. 鳍状和分级沸石中增加的外部表面积减少了外部积碳。

化学性质：
1. 酸交换（H形式）沸石在催化活性中起着关键作用。
2. H-ZSM-11和H-ZSM-5的种子样品和鳍状样品显示出相似的初始催化活性，表明酸性位点的可接触性得以保持。

支持体修饰策略：
1. 在沸石晶体上引入鳍状结构：
   a. 改善传质性能
   b. 减少内部扩散限制
   c. 延长催化剂寿命（失活率降低约三倍）
   d. 减少外部积碳形成
   e. 在整个结构中保持催化剂活性

这些发现表明，通过引入鳍状结构来修改沸石催化剂的支持体结构是优化其物理化学性质的有效策略。这种方法可以增强传质、减少积碳、延长催化剂寿命并保持酸性位点的可接触性，所有这些都可能有助于提高各种反应（可能包括脱氢反应）中的催化效率和选择性。
