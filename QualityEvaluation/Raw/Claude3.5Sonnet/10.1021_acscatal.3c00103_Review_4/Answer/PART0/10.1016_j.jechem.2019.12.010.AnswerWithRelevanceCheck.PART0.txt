          [1] "The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique"

[2] "Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports."

[3] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance."

[4] "In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."

[5] "Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

[6] "It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."

[7] "To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9. The propane conversions of Cr/Z-5 catalysts improve with the increase of the amount of acidic sites, while their propylene selectivity and yield decrease with the increase of the amount of acidic sites"

[8] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance."

[9] "The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio"

[10] "Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites play crucial roles in catalytic performance. The Brønsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance C-H bond activation. The amount and strength of acidic sites affect propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and yield. Moderate acidity is beneficial, while excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions.

2. Surface area and porosity: High surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability.

3. Metal dispersion: High dispersion of Cr species on the support contributes to improved catalytic performance, as evidenced by TEM and XRD studies.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between the metal (Cr) and the support (HZSM-5) contribute to the stability and activity of the catalyst, as shown by XPS studies.

5. Support composition: The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support affects the acidity and thus the catalytic performance. Higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratios generally lead to lower acidity, as demonstrated by NH3-TPD studies.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 to achieve suitable acidity and optimal balance between activity and selectivity.

2. Using high-silica HZSM-5 (e.g., SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) to provide moderate acidity and high stability.

3. Optimizing the metal loading to achieve high dispersion of active Cr species while avoiding the formation of bulk Cr2O3.

4. Employing Na+ doping experiments to modify acid sites and understand their role in catalytic performance.

5. Tailoring the pore structure and surface area of the support through synthesis conditions or post-synthesis treatments.

These strategies aim to create catalysts with optimal physicochemical properties, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸度：Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位都在催化性能中起着关键作用。HZSM-5沸石中的Brønsted酸位增加了丙烷吸附并增强了C-H键活化。酸性位点的数量和强度影响丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和产率。适度的酸度有利于反应，而过高的酸度可能导致不希望的副反应。

2. 比表面积和孔隙度：HZSM-5沸石的高比表面积和明确定义的孔道为Cr物种的分散和稳定提供了特殊环境，确保了高催化活性和稳定性。

3. 金属分散度：Cr物种在载体上的高分散度有助于提高催化性能，这一点通过TEM和XRD研究得到证实。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：金属（Cr）与载体（HZSM-5）之间的强相互作用有助于催化剂的稳定性和活性，这一点通过XPS研究得到证实。

5. 载体组成：HZSM-5载体的SiO2/Al2O3比影响其酸度，从而影响催化性能。较高的SiO2/Al2O3比通常会导致较低的酸度，这一点通过NH3-TPD研究得到证实。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 控制HZSM-5的SiO2/Al2O3比例，以获得适当的酸度并在活性和选择性之间达到最佳平衡。

2. 使用高硅HZSM-5（如SiO2/Al2O3 = 260）以提供适度的酸度和高稳定性。

3. 优化金属负载量，以实现活性Cr物种的高分散度，同时避免形成块状Cr2O3。

4. 进行Na+掺杂实验，以修饰酸性位点并了解它们在催化性能中的作用。

5. 通过合成条件或后合成处理来调整载体的孔结构和比表面积。

这些策略旨在创造具有最佳物理化学性质的催化剂，从而在脱氢反应中提高催化效率、选择性和稳定性。
