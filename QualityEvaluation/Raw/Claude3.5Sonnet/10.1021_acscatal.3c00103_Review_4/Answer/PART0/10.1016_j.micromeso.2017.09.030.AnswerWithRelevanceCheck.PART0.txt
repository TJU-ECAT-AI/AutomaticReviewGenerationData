          [1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."

[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."

[3] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

          While the literature does not provide specific information about dehydrogenation reactions or detailed chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, it does discuss how the morphological characteristics of hierarchical zeolites influence catalytic performance in general.

Hierarchical zeolites combine microporous structures with secondary meso- and macroporosity, which enhances mass transport while maintaining molecular sieving ability. This improved structure addresses mass transport limitations found in conventional zeolites, allowing better access for reagents to reach active sites within micropores. This can lead to increased reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetimes.

The secondary porosity in hierarchical zeolites also provides space for depositing active catalytic phases, allowing control over their size and achieving high dispersion. This structure promotes strong interactions between the zeolite and the reaction medium.

While the text doesn't mention specific support modification strategies, the creation of hierarchical structures with secondary porosity can be considered a strategy to optimize catalytic properties. This modification enhances mass transport and accessibility to active sites, which could potentially improve efficiency and selectivity in various catalytic reactions, including dehydrogenation, though this specific reaction is not mentioned in the given literature.

          该文献没有提供关于脱氢反应的具体信息或详细的化学性质，如酸强度和稳定性。然而，它确实讨论了分层沸石的形态特征如何影响一般的催化性能。

分层沸石将微孔结构与次级介孔和大孔结构相结合，在保持分子筛选能力的同时增强了质量传输。这种改进的结构解决了传统沸石中存在的质量传输限制，使反应物更容易到达微孔内的活性位点。这可以导致反应速率的提高和催化剂使用寿命的延长。

分层沸石中的次级孔隙还为沉积活性催化相提供了空间，允许控制它们的尺寸并实现高分散度。这种结构促进了沸石与反应介质之间的强相互作用。

虽然文本没有提到具体的载体改性策略，但创建具有次级孔隙的分层结构可以被视为优化催化性能的一种策略。这种改性增强了质量传输和活性位点的可及性，这可能会提高各种催化反应（包括脱氢反应，尽管本文献中没有特别提到这种反应）的效率和选择性。
