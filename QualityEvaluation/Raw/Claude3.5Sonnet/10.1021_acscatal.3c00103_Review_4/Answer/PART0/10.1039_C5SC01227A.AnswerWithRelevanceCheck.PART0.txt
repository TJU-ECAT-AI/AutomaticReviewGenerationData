          [1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

[4] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[5] "The coordination number of the ad-atom is only 3, which is significantly smaller than CN of the surface atoms on (111) (CN = 9), (211) step edge (CN = 7) and ad-row atoms (CN = 5). It is expected that the strongest binding of a surface intermediate should be observed on an ad-atom due to its smallest coordination number."

[6] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework. Joshi and Thomson showed that [GaH]2+ is more stable in a six-membered ring structure than in an eight-membered ring."

[7] "Besides the position of Al atoms, the topology of zeolite framework also affects the dehydrogenation activity. Wannakao et al. calculated the methane activation in Au-substituted FAU, FER, ZSM-5 and MCM-22."

[8] "Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the higher d-band center of Ni(100) surface (1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (1.78 eV)."

[9] "Besides the electronic effect, a strong stabilization of adsorbed C atoms was observed on Ni(100), which binds >100 kJ mol1 stronger than a C atom on Ni(111). The more stable tetra-coordinated C on Ni(100) reflects the needs of a C atom to satisfy its valence."

[10] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism: (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical composition and electronic properties:
- Alloying Pt with metals like Cu and Sn can increase selectivity towards propylene in propane dehydrogenation.
- The d-band center of metal catalysts affects their dehydrogenation activity, with higher d-band centers generally resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers and higher activity.

2. Surface structure and morphology:
- Different surface structures of Pt (211, 100, 111) show varying dehydrogenation activities, with Pt(211) being the most active.
- The coordination number of active sites impacts the stability of intermediates and binding strength.

3. Stability and coking resistance:
- Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a major challenge for Pt catalysts.
- The addition of promoters like late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides can improve the catalyst's resistance to coking.

4. Support effects:
- The zeolite framework structure influences the stability of active metal species.
- Different zeolite topologies (e.g., FAU, FER, ZSM-5, MCM-22) exhibit varying dehydrogenation activities.

5. Redox properties:
- For oxide catalysts like vanadium oxide, the ability to undergo reduction and re-oxidation is crucial for the catalytic cycle in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Alloying and promoter addition: Incorporating metals like Cu or Sn into Pt catalysts to improve selectivity and coking resistance.
2. Surface structuring: Controlling the surface structure of the catalyst to optimize activity and binding properties.
3. Tuning the zeolite framework: Adjusting the framework structure, composition, and topology to influence the stability and activity of active sites.
4. Controlling particle size and shape: This can expose different crystal facets and create specific types of active sites.
5. Modifying the metal-support interaction: This can alter the electronic properties of the active metal and influence catalyst stability.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tailoring the catalyst's chemical and morphological properties to suit the specific requirements of the dehydrogenation reaction.
