[1] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. It is proposed that VOsupport bonds are active sites, as lattice oxygen in VO bonds directly catalyses CH activation forming H2."

[2] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst."

[3] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene."

[4] "Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions. Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2."

[5] "The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase. This has been demonstrated multiple times over metal oxides such as those of Ga, Cr, V and Fe, where SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 have been widely implemented as supports."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Metal-support interactions: These affect catalyst performance by creating active sites. For example, V-O-support bonds directly catalyze C-H activation.

2. Acidity and basicity: A balance of acid and base sites is crucial. Acid sites activate alkanes, while basic sites facilitate alkene desorption. However, overly strong acid sites can lead to coking or overoxidation.

3. Surface area and porosity: These properties affect the dispersion of the active phase. Supports like SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 are commonly used to enhance and maintain high dispersion of active metal oxides.

4. Redox properties: For oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the ability of the catalyst to cycle between different oxidation states is important for activating the oxidant and the alkane.

5. Thermal stability: This is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance at high reaction temperatures and during regeneration cycles.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling acidity/basicity: This can be done through the choice of support material or by adding promoters to adjust the acid-base properties.

2. Increasing surface area: Using mesoporous materials or creating hierarchical pore structures can increase the available surface area for active site dispersion.

3. Enhancing metal-support interactions: This can be achieved through careful preparation methods, such as grafting or using specific precursors.

4. Improving thermal stability: Adding stabilizers or using mixed oxide supports can enhance the catalyst's resistance to sintering at high temperatures.

5. Tuning redox properties: Incorporating promoters or creating mixed oxide systems can optimize the catalyst's redox behavior for specific reactions.

By carefully controlling these properties and employing appropriate modification strategies, catalysts can be designed with enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 金属-载体相互作用：这些相互作用通过创建活性位点影响催化剂性能。例如，V-O-载体键直接催化C-H活化。

2. 酸度和碱度：酸碱位点的平衡至关重要。酸位点活化烷烃，而碱位点促进烯烃脱附。然而，过强的酸位点可能导致结焦或过度氧化。

3. 比表面积和孔隙度：这些性质影响活性相的分散度。SiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2等载体常用于增强和维持活性金属氧化物的高分散度。

4. 氧化还原性质：对于氧化脱氢反应，催化剂在不同氧化态之间循环的能力对于活化氧化剂和烷烃很重要。

5. 热稳定性：这对于在高反应温度下和再生循环期间维持催化剂性能至关重要。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 控制酸度/碱度：可以通过选择载体材料或添加助剂来调节酸碱性质。

2. 增加比表面积：使用介孔材料或创建分层孔结构可以增加活性位点分散的可用表面积。

3. 增强金属-载体相互作用：这可以通过精心设计的制备方法实现，如接枝或使用特定前驱体。

4. 提高热稳定性：添加稳定剂或使用混合氧化物载体可以增强催化剂在高温下抗烧结的能力。

5. 调节氧化还原性质：引入助剂或创建混合氧化物系统可以优化催化剂的氧化还原行为以适应特定反应。

通过仔细控制这些性质并采用适当的修饰策略，可以设计出具有增强效率、选择性和稳定性的脱氢反应催化剂。
