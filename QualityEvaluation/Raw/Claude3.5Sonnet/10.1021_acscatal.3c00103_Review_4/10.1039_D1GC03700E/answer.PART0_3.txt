[1] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. It is proposed that VOsupport bonds are active sites, as lattice oxygen in VO bonds directly catalyses CH activation forming H2."

[2] "The acidic promoter influences both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst by reducing the surface acidity of alumina, thus suppressing undesired side reactions."

[3] "Limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as catalytic cracking and coke formation. However, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups can function as nucleation sites for Pt, enhancing dispersion."

[4] "Regardless of catalyst, common themes have been established in efforts to improve CH bond activation, reducing propane and hydrogen adsorption on surface sites. Of these, supports with weak and moderate surface acidity coupled promoting elements (B, Ga, Cu and Ni to name a few) result in lower Pt utilisation, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts."

[5] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene. The addition of CO2 is likely to result in competitive adsorption on basic sites, and this may result in longer surface lifetimes of alkyl intermediates, resulting in undesirable side-reactions."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acid strength: Moderate acidity is beneficial for activating alkanes, but strong acidity can lead to undesirable side reactions like cracking and coke formation. Weak to moderate surface acidity is generally preferred.

2. Metal-support interactions: These affect catalyst performance by creating active sites. For example, V-O-support bonds can directly catalyze C-H activation.

3. Surface area and porosity: High surface area and appropriate pore structure enhance dispersion of active sites and improve mass transfer.

4. Redox properties: The ability of the catalyst to cycle between oxidation states (e.g., Cr6+/Cr3+) is important for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Basic sites: These facilitate alkene desorption and can activate CO2 in ODH-CO2 reactions.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Doping with promoters: Elements like B, Ga, Cu, and Ni can modify acidity and improve dispersion of active sites.

2. Controlling support acidity: This can be done through choice of support material (e.g., SiO2 vs Al2O3) or by adding basic promoters to reduce acidity.

3. Tailoring porosity: Using mesoporous materials or creating hierarchical pore structures can improve mass transfer and active site accessibility.

4. Surface functionalization: This can create specific types of active sites or modify adsorption properties.

5. Mixed oxide supports: Combining different oxides can create synergistic effects and tune catalyst properties.

These strategies aim to balance various factors like alkane activation, alkene desorption, and suppression of side reactions to enhance overall catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸强度：适度的酸性有利于活化烷烃，但强酸性可能导致不良的副反应，如裂解和积碳。通常更倾向于弱到中等的表面酸性。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：这些相互作用通过创建活性位点影响催化剂性能。例如，V-O-载体键可以直接催化C-H键的活化。

3. 比表面积和孔隙度：高比表面积和适当的孔结构可以增强活性位点的分散性并改善质量传递。

4. 氧化还原性质：催化剂在氧化态之间循环的能力（如Cr6+/Cr3+）对于氧化脱氢反应很重要。

5. 碱性位点：这些位点有助于烯烃脱附，并可以在ODH-CO2反应中活化CO2。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：B、Ga、Cu和Ni等元素可以调节酸性并改善活性位点的分散性。

2. 控制载体酸性：可以通过选择载体材料（如SiO2或Al2O3）或添加碱性助剂来降低酸性。

3. 调整孔隙度：使用介孔材料或创建分层孔结构可以改善质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

4. 表面功能化：这可以创建特定类型的活性位点或修改吸附性质。

5. 混合氧化物载体：结合不同的氧化物可以创造协同效应并调节催化剂性质。

这些策略旨在平衡烷烃活化、烯烃脱附和抑制副反应等各种因素，以提高脱氢反应的整体催化效率和选择性。
