          [1] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst."

[2] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene."

[3] "The acid and base sites of the support also affect the performance of the catalyst and can be adjusted with promotors."

[4] "Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions."

[5] "Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2."

[6] "Therefore, a balance of these sites is necessary to promote sufficient propane activation and propene desorption."

[7] "The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase."

[8] "It was found that the acidic nature of the alumina support, over which dehydrogenated propene adsorbed to the support surface where it further oxidised to COx species. This effect is less prominent on less acidic support surfaces such as SiO2 and MCM-41."

[9] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. It is proposed that VOsupport bonds are active sites, as lattice oxygen in VO bonds directly catalyses CH activation forming H2."

[10] "The acidic promoter influences both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst by reducing the surface acidity of alumina, thus suppressing undesired side reactions."

[11] "Limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as catalytic cracking and coke formation. However, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups can function as nucleation sites for Pt, enhancing dispersion."

[12] "Regardless of catalyst, common themes have been established in efforts to improve CH bond activation, reducing propane and hydrogen adsorption on surface sites. Of these, supports with weak and moderate surface acidity coupled promoting elements (B, Ga, Cu and Ni to name a few) result in lower Pt utilisation, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts."

[13] "Acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid-base characteristics and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. 

1. Acidity and Basicity:
   - A balance between acid and base sites is crucial for optimal catalytic performance.
   - Acid sites are important for alkane activation, but overly strong acidity can lead to coking, overoxidation, or retention of alkanes on the surface.
   - Basic sites facilitate alkene desorption and, in ODH-CO2 reactions, activate CO2.
   - Generally, lowering surface acidity enhances catalytic performance in DDH reactions.
   - Less acidic supports (e.g., SiO2, MCM-41) often perform better than more acidic ones (e.g., alumina).

2. Metal-Support Interactions:
   - These interactions significantly affect catalyst performance.
   - Metal-support bonds (e.g., V-O-support) can serve as active sites for C-H activation.

3. Morphology and Dispersion:
   - The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase.
   - Support morphology affects the dispersion of active metals (e.g., V, Pt).
   - High dispersion generally improves catalytic activity.

4. Surface Area and Porosity:
   - These properties affect the accessibility of active sites and mass transfer characteristics.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adjusting Acidity/Basicity:
   - Use of promoters to modify acid-base properties.
   - Selection of appropriate support materials with desired acidity/basicity.

2. Enhancing Dispersion:
   - Use of supports like SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 to maintain high dispersion of active phases.
   - Incorporation of promoters (e.g., B, Ga, Cu, Ni) to enhance dispersion and modify surface properties.

3. Tailoring Support Morphology:
   - Development of supports with specific structural characteristics to enhance mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Controlling Metal-Support Interactions:
   - Careful selection of preparation methods and precursors to optimize these interactions.

By carefully tuning these physicochemical properties through support modification, catalysts can be designed to exhibit enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸碱特性和形态，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。

1. 酸度和碱度：
   - 酸碱位点之间的平衡对于获得最佳催化性能至关重要。
   - 酸性位点对烷烃活化很重要，但过强的酸性可能导致结焦、过度氧化或烷烃在表面上的滞留。
   - 碱性位点有助于烯烃脱附，在ODH-CO2反应中还能活化CO2。
   - 一般来说，降低表面酸度可以提高直接脱氢（DDH）反应的催化性能。
   - 较低酸性的载体（如SiO2、MCM-41）通常比更酸性的载体（如氧化铝）表现更好。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：
   - 这些相互作用显著影响催化剂性能。
   - 金属-载体键（如V-O-载体）可以作为C-H活化的活性位点。

3. 形态和分散性：
   - 载体的主要作用是增强和维持活性相的高度分散。
   - 载体形态影响活性金属（如V、Pt）的分散性。
   - 高分散度通常可以提高催化活性。

4. 比表面积和孔隙度：
   - 这些性质影响活性位点的可及性和传质特性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 调整酸度/碱度：
   - 使用助剂修饰酸碱性质。
   - 选择具有所需酸度/碱度的适当载体材料。

2. 提高分散度：
   - 使用SiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2等载体来维持活性相的高度分散。
   - 引入助剂（如B、Ga、Cu、Ni）以增强分散性并修饰表面性质。

3. 定制载体形态：
   - 开发具有特定结构特征的载体，以增强物质传递和活性位点的可及性。

4. 控制金属-载体相互作用：
   - 仔细选择制备方法和前驱体以优化这些相互作用。

通过仔细调整这些物理化学性质，可以设计出在脱氢反应中表现出更高效率、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。
