The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid-base characteristics and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. 

Acid sites play a crucial role in activating alkanes, but overly strong acidity can lead to undesirable side effects such as coking or overoxidation. Conversely, basic sites facilitate alkene desorption and, in the case of ODH-CO2, activate CO2. Therefore, achieving an optimal balance between acid and base sites is essential for promoting efficient propane activation and propene desorption.

The morphology of the catalyst support is also critical. The primary function of the support is to enhance and maintain a high dispersion of the active phase, which directly impacts catalytic efficiency. 

To optimize these properties, various support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Adjusting acidity/basicity: This can be achieved through the use of promoters or by selecting appropriate support materials. Lowering surface acidity has been shown to enhance catalytic performance in DDH reactions.

2. Enhancing dispersion: Choosing supports with high surface areas and appropriate pore structures can help maintain a high dispersion of the active phase.

3. Balancing acid-base properties: This can be done by carefully selecting support materials and modifying them with appropriate promoters to achieve the optimal balance for the specific reaction.

4. Tailoring support morphology: Developing supports with specific structural characteristics (e.g., mesoporous materials) can enhance mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

By carefully tuning these physicochemical properties, catalysts can be designed to exhibit enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是其酸碱特性和形态，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。

酸性位点在活化烷烃方面起着关键作用，但过强的酸性可能导致不良副作用，如结焦或过度氧化。相反，碱性位点有助于烯烃脱附，在CO2氧化脱氢反应中还能活化CO2。因此，实现酸碱位点之间的最佳平衡对于促进高效的丙烷活化和丙烯脱附至关重要。

催化剂载体的形态也非常重要。载体的主要功能是提高和维持活性相的高度分散，这直接影响催化效率。

为了优化这些性质，可以采用各种载体改性策略：

1. 调整酸度/碱度：这可以通过使用助剂或选择适当的载体材料来实现。降低表面酸度已被证明可以提高直接脱氢反应的催化性能。

2. 提高分散度：选择具有高比表面积和适当孔结构的载体可以帮助维持活性相的高度分散。

3. 平衡酸碱性质：可以通过仔细选择载体材料并用适当的助剂对其进行改性，以达到特定反应的最佳平衡。

4. 定制载体形态：开发具有特定结构特征（如介孔材料）的载体可以增强物质传递和活性位点的可及性。

通过精心调整这些物理化学性质，可以设计出在脱氢反应中表现出更高效率和选择性的催化剂。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The balance between acid and base sites is crucial for optimal catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Acid sites are important for alkane activation, but overly strong acid sites can lead to coking or overoxidation. Basic sites facilitate alkene desorption and, in the case of ODH-CO2, CO2 activation. The support's acidity plays a role in product adsorption and further oxidation, with less acidic supports like SiO2 and MCM-41 showing better performance than more acidic supports like alumina.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Selecting appropriate support materials: SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 are commonly used to enhance and maintain high dispersion of active phases.

2. Adjusting acid-base properties: The balance of acid and base sites can be modified using promoters, a strategy widely applied in DDH catalysts.

3. Controlling support acidity: Using less acidic supports or modifying support acidity can help minimize unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity.

4. Enhancing dispersion: Supports play a crucial role in maintaining high dispersion of active phases, which is essential for catalytic performance.

By carefully tailoring these physicochemical properties through support modification, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

[1] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance. It is proposed that VOsupport bonds are active sites, as lattice oxygen in VO bonds directly catalyses CH activation forming H2."

[2] "The acidic promoter influences both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst by reducing the surface acidity of alumina, thus suppressing undesired side reactions."

[3] "Limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as catalytic cracking and coke formation. However, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups can function as nucleation sites for Pt, enhancing dispersion."

[4] "Regardless of catalyst, common themes have been established in efforts to improve CH bond activation, reducing propane and hydrogen adsorption on surface sites. Of these, supports with weak and moderate surface acidity coupled promoting elements (B, Ga, Cu and Ni to name a few) result in lower Pt utilisation, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts."

[5] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene. The addition of CO2 is likely to result in competitive adsorption on basic sites, and this may result in longer surface lifetimes of alkyl intermediates, resulting in undesirable side-reactions."
