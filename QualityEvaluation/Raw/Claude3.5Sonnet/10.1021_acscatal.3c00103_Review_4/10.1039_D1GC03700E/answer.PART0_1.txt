[1] "It was found that the acidic nature of the alumina support, over which dehydrogenated propene adsorbed to the support surface where it further oxidised to COx species. This effect is less prominent on less acidic support surfaces such as SiO2 and MCM-41."

[2] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene."

[3] "Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions. Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2."

[4] "The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase. This has been demonstrated multiple times over metal oxides such as those of Ga, Cr, V and Fe, where SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 have been widely implemented as supports."

[5] "The acid and base sites of the support also affect the performance of the catalyst and can be adjusted with promotors. This strategy has been widely applied in DDH catalysts."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The balance between acid and base sites is crucial for optimal catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Acid sites are important for alkane activation, but overly strong acid sites can lead to coking or overoxidation. Basic sites facilitate alkene desorption and, in the case of ODH-CO2, CO2 activation. The support's acidity plays a role in product adsorption and further oxidation, with less acidic supports like SiO2 and MCM-41 showing better performance than more acidic supports like alumina.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Selecting appropriate support materials: SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 are commonly used to enhance and maintain high dispersion of active phases.

2. Adjusting acid-base properties: The balance of acid and base sites can be modified using promoters, a strategy widely applied in DDH catalysts.

3. Controlling support acidity: Using less acidic supports or modifying support acidity can help minimize unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity.

4. Enhancing dispersion: Supports play a crucial role in maintaining high dispersion of active phases, which is essential for catalytic performance.

By carefully tailoring these physicochemical properties through support modification, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度、稳定性和形态，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。酸碱位点之间的平衡对于获得最佳的催化效率和选择性至关重要。

酸性位点对烷烃活化很重要，但过强的酸性位点会导致结焦或过度氧化。碱性位点有助于烯烃脱附，在ODH-CO2反应中还可以活化CO2。载体的酸性影响产物吸附和进一步氧化，相比于更酸性的氧化铝载体，SiO2和MCM-41等较低酸性的载体表现更好。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 选择适当的载体材料：SiO2、Al2O3和ZrO2常用于增强和维持活性相的高分散性。

2. 调整酸碱性质：使用助剂可以修饰酸碱位点的平衡，这是DDH催化剂中广泛应用的策略。

3. 控制载体酸性：使用较低酸性的载体或修饰载体酸性可以帮助最小化不需要的副反应并提高选择性。

4. 提高分散性：载体在维持活性相高分散性方面起着关键作用，这对催化性能至关重要。

通过仔细调整这些物理化学性质，可以优化催化剂，以提高脱氢反应的效率和选择性。
