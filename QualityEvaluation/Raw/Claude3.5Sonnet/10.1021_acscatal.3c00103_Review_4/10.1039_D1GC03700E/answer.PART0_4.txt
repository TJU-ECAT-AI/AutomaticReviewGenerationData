[1] "The nature of the support is an essential parameter to consider as several possible VOx can species exist. It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance."

[2] "Acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity."

[3] "The balance of acid and base sites is important to mediate the activation of the alkane and the desorption of the alkene."

[4] "Acid sites are widely known to activate alkanes, but if the acid sites are too strong, the alkane will be retained on the surface and lead to coking, or overoxidation in the case of ODH-N2O and ODH-O2 reactions. Basic sites on the other hand, are known to facilitate alkene desorption and in the case of ODH-CO2, to activate CO2."

[5] "The primary role of the support is to enhance and maintain high dispersion of the active phase. This has been demonstrated multiple times over metal oxides such as those of Ga, Cr, V and Fe, where SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 have been widely implemented as supports."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Metal-support interactions affect catalyst performance. The nature of the support determines the types of active species that can form on the surface.

2. Acidity plays a crucial role. While acidic sites can activate alkanes, overly strong acidity can lead to coking or overoxidation. Moderate acidity is generally preferred.

3. Basicity is important for alkene desorption and CO2 activation in ODH-CO2 reactions.

4. Support morphology affects dispersion of the active phase. High dispersion is typically desirable for improved catalytic activity.

5. Surface area and porosity of the support influence accessibility of active sites and mass transfer properties.

To optimize these properties, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Tuning acidity/basicity through dopants or mixed oxide supports
2. Controlling support crystallinity and phase composition
3. Modifying surface area and pore structure through templating or post-synthesis treatments
4. Using promoters to enhance dispersion and stability of active species
5. Employing supports with desirable redox properties to facilitate oxidant activation

The goal is to achieve an optimal balance of acidity/basicity, high dispersion of active sites, and suitable morphology to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity for the target dehydrogenation reaction.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 金属-载体相互作用影响催化剂性能。载体的性质决定了可以在表面形成的活性物种类型。

2. 酸性起着关键作用。虽然酸性位点可以活化烷烃，但过强的酸性会导致结焦或过度氧化。通常首选中等酸性。

3. 碱性对于烯烃脱附和CO2活化在ODH-CO2反应中很重要。

4. 载体形貌影响活性相的分散度。高分散度通常有利于提高催化活性。

5. 载体的比表面积和孔隙度影响活性位点的可及性和传质性能。

为了优化这些性质，可以采用几种载体改性策略：

1. 通过掺杂剂或混合氧化物载体调节酸度/碱度
2. 控制载体的结晶度和相组成
3. 通过模板法或后合成处理修改比表面积和孔结构
4. 使用助剂来增强活性物种的分散性和稳定性
5. 使用具有理想氧化还原性能的载体以促进氧化剂的活化

目标是实现酸度/碱度的最佳平衡、活性位点的高分散度以及合适的形貌，以提高目标脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
