[1] "The effective improvement of CO2 adsorption mainly originated from the large surface area, which promoted the CO2 adsorption capacity."

[2] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."

[3] "The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice."

[4] "The mesopores thus serve as hosts for large biological molecules or metal complexes."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including surface area, pore structure, and acidity, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Large surface areas promote adsorption capacity, while introduced meso- or macropores shorten diffusion paths to internal active sites, enhancing interactions with bulky molecules. These structural modifications improve mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

Support modification strategies to optimize catalytic properties include:

1. Introducing mesoporosity or macroporosity into microporous zeolites
2. Increasing the external surface area
3. Tailoring the pore structure for specific molecule sizes
4. Modifying acidity through dealumination or ion exchange
5. Creating hierarchical pore structures with interconnected micro-, meso-, and macropores

These strategies can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by improving diffusion, increasing accessible active sites, and allowing better control over reaction pathways. The optimal modification approach depends on the specific reaction requirements and target molecules involved in the dehydrogenation process.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括表面积、孔结构和酸度，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。大表面积促进吸附能力，而引入的介孔或大孔缩短了到内部活性位点的扩散路径，增强了与大分子的相互作用。这些结构修饰改善了传质和活性位点的可及性。

优化催化性能的支持体改性策略包括：

1. 在微孔沸石中引入介孔或大孔
2. 增加外部表面积
3. 针对特定分子尺寸调整孔结构
4. 通过脱铝或离子交换修改酸度
5. 创建具有互连微孔、介孔和大孔的分级孔结构

这些策略可以通过改善扩散、增加可及的活性位点和更好地控制反应路径来提高催化效率和选择性。最佳的改性方法取决于脱氢过程中涉及的特定反应要求和目标分子。
