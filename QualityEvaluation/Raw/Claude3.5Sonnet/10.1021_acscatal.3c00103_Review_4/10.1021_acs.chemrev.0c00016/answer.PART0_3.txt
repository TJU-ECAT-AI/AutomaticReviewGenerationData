[1] "The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."

[2] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions."

[3] "The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice."

[4] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including both chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acid strength and stability: These chemical properties are crucial for the catalytic activity and longevity of the catalyst. Stronger acid sites can enhance the cracking ability, while stability ensures consistent performance over time.

2. Pore size and connectivity: These morphological characteristics directly affect the accessibility of active sites and the diffusion of reactants and products. Larger pores (meso- and macropores) facilitate the movement of bulky molecules, while good connectivity ensures efficient mass transfer throughout the catalyst.

3. Surface area: A higher surface area generally provides more active sites for reactions to occur, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

4. Crystal size: Smaller crystals can reduce diffusion limitations and improve overall catalyst efficiency.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Introducing hierarchical porosity: Creating meso- and macropores in addition to micropores can significantly enhance mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

2. Surface functionalization: Modifying the surface chemistry can tune the acid-base properties and improve interactions with specific reactants.

3. Controlled dealumination or desilication: These processes can create additional porosity and modify the acid site distribution.

4. Template-assisted synthesis: Using specific templates during zeolite synthesis can help control pore structure and crystal size.

5. Post-synthesis treatments: Various treatments like steaming or acid leaching can modify porosity and acid site distribution.

6. Metal incorporation: Adding metals can introduce new active sites and modify catalyst selectivity.

By carefully optimizing these properties through various modification strategies, catalysts can be tailored for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for processes involving bulky molecules.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响：

1. 酸强度和稳定性：这些化学性质对催化剂的催化活性和寿命至关重要。更强的酸性位点可以增强裂解能力，而稳定性则确保了长期的一致性能。

2. 孔径和连通性：这些形态特征直接影响活性位点的可及性以及反应物和产物的扩散。较大的孔（介孔和大孔）有利于体积大的分子运动，而良好的连通性确保了整个催化剂中的高效质量传递。

3. 比表面积：较高的比表面积通常提供更多的反应活性位点，可能增加催化活性。

4. 晶体尺寸：较小的晶体可以减少扩散限制，提高整体催化效率。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 引入多级孔结构：在微孔之外创造介孔和大孔可以显著增强质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

2. 表面功能化：修改表面化学性质可以调节酸碱性，改善与特定反应物的相互作用。

3. 控制脱铝或脱硅：这些过程可以创造额外的孔隙度并修改酸性位点分布。

4. 模板辅助合成：在沸石合成过程中使用特定模板可以帮助控制孔结构和晶体尺寸。

5. 后合成处理：蒸汽处理或酸浸等各种处理可以修改孔隙度和酸性位点分布。

6. 金属引入：添加金属可以引入新的活性位点并修改催化剂选择性。

通过仔细优化这些性质和采用各种改性策略，可以定制催化剂，以提高脱氢反应的效率和选择性，特别是对于涉及体积大分子的过程。
