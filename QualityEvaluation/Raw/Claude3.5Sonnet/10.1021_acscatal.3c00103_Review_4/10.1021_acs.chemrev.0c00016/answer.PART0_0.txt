[1] "The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."

[2] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions."

[3] "The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice."

[4] "The larger mesopores allow bulky reactants to access the catalytic sites within the zeolite crystals, thereby promoting the primary reactions to yield more gasoline and LCO."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The accessibility of catalytically active sites is a crucial factor, which is determined by both pore size and pore connectivity in zeolites. Larger pore sizes and improved connectivity enhance the accessibility of bulky reactants to active sites, promoting primary reactions and improving catalytic efficiency.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Introduction of mesoporosity or macroporosity: Creating hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal can significantly improve catalytic performance for reactions involving bulky molecules.

2. Pore size engineering: Designing catalysts with larger mesopores allows bulky reactants to access catalytic sites within zeolite crystals more easily, promoting desired reactions and improving product yields.

3. Enhancing pore connectivity: Developing zeolites with well-connected pore networks facilitates mass transfer and improves the overall accessibility of active sites.

4. Surface modification: Modifying the outer surface of zeolite crystals to create additional access points for reactants can enhance catalytic performance.

5. Hierarchical structuring: Creating multi-level porous systems (micro-meso-macroporous) can optimize mass transfer and reactant accessibility across different scales.

These strategies aim to overcome diffusion limitations, increase the number of accessible active sites, and improve overall catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions involving bulky molecules.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。催化活性位点的可及性是一个关键因素，这取决于沸石中的孔径大小和孔隙连通性。较大的孔径和改善的连通性可以增强大体积反应物对活性位点的可及性，促进初级反应并提高催化效率。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种载体改性策略：

1. 引入介孔或大孔：创建具有丰富介孔或大孔的分级多孔沸石，这些孔道可以直接从沸石晶体的外表面进入，能显著提高涉及大分子的反应的催化性能。

2. 孔径工程：设计具有较大介孔的催化剂，使大体积反应物更容易进入沸石晶体内的催化位点，促进所需反应并提高产品产率。

3. 增强孔隙连通性：开发具有良好连通孔隙网络的沸石，促进物质传递并提高活性位点的整体可及性。

4. 表面改性：修饰沸石晶体的外表面，为反应物创造额外的进入点，可以提高催化性能。

5. 分级结构：创建多级孔隙系统（微孔-介孔-大孔），可以在不同尺度上优化物质传递和反应物可及性。

这些策略旨在克服扩散限制，增加可及活性位点的数量，并提高涉及大分子的脱氢反应的整体催化效率和选择性。
