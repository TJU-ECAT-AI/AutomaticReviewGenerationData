[1] "The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites."

[2] "Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules."

[3] "The catalytic activity of the catalysts increased as their mesoporous volume and the accessible surface area increased."

[4] "The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including both chemical and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. While the literature does not specifically discuss dehydrogenation reactions, it provides insights into how catalyst properties affect related processes like desulfurization, which can be applied to dehydrogenation:

1. Porosity: Introducing mesoporosity or macroporosity into microporous zeolites improves accessibility to active sites for bulky molecules. This enhanced accessibility can lead to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions involving larger substrates.

2. Surface area: Increasing the accessible surface area of catalysts generally leads to improved catalytic activity. In dehydrogenation reactions, a larger surface area would provide more active sites for the reaction to occur.

3. Diffusion path: Meso- and macropores shorten the diffusion path to internal active sites, which can enhance the interaction between reactants and catalysts. This improved mass transfer can lead to higher efficiency in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Surface chemistry: Modifications like desilication can create new surface features, such as terminal silanol groups, which may influence the adsorption capacity and catalytic properties of the material.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Introducing hierarchical porosity through techniques like templating or post-synthesis treatments (e.g., desilication) to create meso- and macropores.

2. Controlling the size and distribution of pores to optimize the balance between accessibility and surface area.

3. Tailoring the surface chemistry through treatments that create specific functional groups or modify the acid-base properties of the catalyst.

4. Optimizing the metal dispersion and interaction with the support to enhance the active site density and stability.

These strategies can be combined and fine-tuned to develop catalysts with optimal physicochemical properties for specific dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。虽然文献并未具体讨论脱氢反应，但它提供了关于催化剂性质如何影响相关过程（如脱硫）的见解，这些见解可以应用于脱氢反应：

1. 孔隙度：在微孔沸石中引入介孔或大孔可以改善大分子对活性位点的可及性。这种增强的可及性可以提高涉及较大底物的脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。

2. 表面积：增加催化剂的可及表面积通常会提高催化活性。在脱氢反应中，较大的表面积将提供更多的反应活性位点。

3. 扩散路径：介孔和大孔缩短了到内部活性位点的扩散路径，这可以增强反应物与催化剂之间的相互作用。这种改善的物质传递可以提高脱氢反应的效率。

4. 表面化学：如脱硅等改性可以创造新的表面特征，如端基硅醇基，这可能会影响材料的吸附能力和催化性能。

为了优化这些性质以提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种支撑体改性策略：

1. 通过模板法或后合成处理（如脱硅）等技术引入多级孔隙度，创造介孔和大孔。

2. 控制孔隙的大小和分布，以优化可及性和表面积之间的平衡。

3. 通过创造特定官能团或修改催化剂的酸碱性来调整表面化学性质。

4. 优化金属分散度和与支撑体的相互作用，以提高活性位点密度和稳定性。

这些策略可以组合和微调，以开发具有最佳物理化学性质的催化剂，用于特定的脱氢反应，从而可能提高效率、选择性和稳定性。
