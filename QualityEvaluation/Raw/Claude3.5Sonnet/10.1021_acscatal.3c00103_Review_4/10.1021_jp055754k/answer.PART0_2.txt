[1] "The electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support, as can be seen from the changes in the Pt binding energy and stretching frequency of adsorbed CO."

[2] "At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites."

[3] "The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well."

[4] "When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support affects the electronic properties of supported platinum, with increased acidity leading to greater alterations in Pt properties. Conversely, the presence of platinum reduces the strength of acid sites on the support.

To optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies can involve impregnation with platinum. This modification reduces the strength of acid sites, which suppresses cracking reactions and alters cracking selectivity. The significant reduction in acid site strength after Pt impregnation results in the virtual elimination of the strongest acid sites in Pt-modified catalysts.

These modifications can lead to improved catalytic performance by tailoring the balance between metal and acid site properties. By carefully controlling the acid-metal interactions, it is possible to enhance the desired dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions like cracking.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。载体的酸度影响负载铂的电子性质，酸度增加导致铂性质的变化更大。相反，铂的存在降低了载体上酸位的强度。

为了优化催化效率和选择性，可以采用铂浸渍等载体改性策略。这种改性降低了酸位的强度，从而抑制了裂化反应并改变了裂化选择性。铂浸渍后酸位强度的显著降低导致铂改性催化剂中几乎不存在最强的酸位。

这些改性可以通过调节金属和酸位性质之间的平衡来提高催化性能。通过仔细控制酸-金属相互作用，可以增强所需的脱氢反应，同时最大限度地减少裂化等不需要的副反应。
