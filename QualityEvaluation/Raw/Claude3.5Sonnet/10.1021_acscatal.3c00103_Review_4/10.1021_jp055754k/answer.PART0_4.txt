[1] "The electronic properties of Pt are influenced by the acidity of the support, and the alteration of Pt properties increases with increasing acidity of the support, as can be seen from the changes in the Pt binding energy and stretching frequency of adsorbed CO."

[2] "At the same time, the presence of platinum affects the acidic properties of the supports by reducing the strength of the acid sites."

[3] "When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts."

[4] "The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acidity of the support affects the electronic properties of supported platinum, with increased support acidity leading to greater alteration of platinum properties. Conversely, the presence of platinum reduces the strength of acid sites on the support.

Support modification strategies, such as impregnation with platinum, can be employed to optimize catalytic properties. When zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with platinum, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced, with virtually no strongest acid sites remaining in the Pt-modified catalysts. This modification suppresses cracking reactions and alters cracking selectivity.

These changes in acid site strength and distribution can be used to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. By carefully controlling the balance between metal and acid properties through support modification, it is possible to tailor the catalyst for specific reactions, potentially improving performance in dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing undesired side reactions like cracking.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是酸强度和稳定性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。载体的酸度影响负载铂的电子性质，载体酸度的增加导致铂性质的更大改变。反之，铂的存在降低了载体上酸位的强度。

可以采用载体改性策略，如铂浸渍，来优化催化性能。当沸石和HMCM-41被铂浸渍时，其酸位强度显著降低，铂改性的催化剂中几乎不存在最强的酸位。这种改性抑制了裂化反应并改变了裂化选择性。

这些酸位强度和分布的变化可用于提高催化效率和选择性。通过carefully控制载体改性过程中金属和酸性质之间的平衡，可以为特定反应定制催化剂，潜在地改善脱氢反应性能，同时最小化裂化等不良副反应。
