[1] "The alteration of the electronic properties of supported metals by the support is well documented in the literature for various supports, especially reducible oxides, such as TiO2, and zeolites."

[2] "The shifts to lower frequency in the infrared spectra of CO adsorbed on supported metals correlate with the increasing support alkalinity and are attributable to the changes in the electron density of the supported metal."

[3] "When zeolites are modified with platinum, the conversion of decalin follows the same overall reaction scheme (see Figure 5), but the initial reaction step of the underlying reaction mechanism is different."

[4] "It can thus be concluded from the experimental data on decalin ring opening that the introduction of platinum into zeolites results in the reduction of the acid site strengths and, consequently, in the suppression of the cracking reactions."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acid strength and stability of the support play a crucial role in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The literature shows that the electronic properties of supported metals are altered by the support, with changes in electron density affecting catalytic performance.

Support modification strategies, such as introducing platinum into zeolites, can be employed to optimize catalyst properties. This modification results in a reduction of acid site strengths, which suppresses undesired cracking reactions. The alkalinity of the support also correlates with changes in the electronic properties of the supported metal, as evidenced by shifts in infrared spectra of adsorbed CO.

To enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies should focus on tailoring the acid-base properties of the support and optimizing the electronic interaction between the metal and support. This may involve careful selection of support materials, controlling the metal loading and dispersion, and fine-tuning the preparation methods to achieve the desired balance of acidity and metal-support interactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。载体的酸强度和稳定性在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。文献表明，载体会改变负载金属的电子性质，电子密度的变化会影响催化性能。

可以采用载体改性策略（如将铂引入沸石）来优化催化剂性质。这种改性会导致酸位强度降低，从而抑制不需要的裂化反应。载体的碱性也与负载金属电子性质的变化相关，这可以从吸附CO的红外光谱的移动中得到证实。

为了提高催化效率和选择性，载体改性策略应该集中在调整载体的酸碱性质，并优化金属与载体之间的电子相互作用。这可能涉及仔细选择载体材料，控制金属负载量和分散度，以及微调制备方法，以实现酸度和金属-载体相互作用的理想平衡。
