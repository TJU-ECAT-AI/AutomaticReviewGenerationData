The given literature does not directly address the influence of physicochemical properties of catalysts on dehydrogenation reactions or support modification strategies for optimizing catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The text primarily focuses on the synthesis and characterization of finned zeolite catalysts for methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reactions, which is a different type of catalytic process. The document does not contain information specific to dehydrogenation catalysts or their support modifications.
