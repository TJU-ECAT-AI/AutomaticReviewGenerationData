[1] "There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption."

[2] "Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin."

[3] "TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst."

[4] "For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime."

[5] "The UVvis spectra for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3f) reveal equivalent internal coke between seed and finned samples; however, there is a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke for the finned sample, which suggests the presence of external protrusions leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses the impact of zeolite catalyst morphology on catalytic performance, specifically focusing on the effects of introducing finned structures to zeolite crystals.

Morphological modifications, such as the creation of finned zeolites, can substantially improve mass transport properties and reduce internal diffusion limitations. This enhancement in mass transport leads to improved catalytic performance, including extended catalyst lifetime and reduced deactivation rates.

The finned structure allows reactions to occur both on the exterior protrusions and within the interior of the catalyst, maintaining similar initial catalytic activity to conventional seed catalysts. However, the finned structure provides significant advantages in terms of catalyst longevity and resistance to deactivation.

Support modification strategies, such as the introduction of fins on zeolite crystals, can be employed to optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These modifications result in reduced external coke formation, which is a common cause of catalyst deactivation. The finned structure leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths, contributing to the extended catalyst lifetime.

While the literature does not directly address acid strength and stability, it suggests that the morphological modifications preserve the essential chemical properties of the zeolite catalysts while enhancing their overall performance through improved mass transport and reduced diffusion limitations.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了沸石催化剂形态对催化性能的影响，特别关注了在沸石晶体上引入鳍状结构的效果。

形态修饰，如创建鳍状沸石，可以大幅改善质量传输性能并减少内部扩散限制。这种质量传输的增强导致了催化性能的改善，包括延长催化剂寿命和降低失活率。

鳍状结构允许反应同时在外部突起和催化剂内部发生，保持了与传统种子催化剂相似的初始催化活性。然而，鳍状结构在催化剂寿命和抗失活性方面提供了显著优势。

支持体修饰策略，如在沸石晶体上引入鳍，可以用来优化催化效率和选择性。这些修饰导致外部焦炭形成减少，而外部焦炭形成是催化剂失活的常见原因。鳍状结构导致孔口处多芳烃的积累减少，有助于延长催化剂寿命。

虽然文献没有直接提到酸强度和稳定性，但它暗示了形态修饰保留了沸石催化剂的基本化学性质，同时通过改善质量传输和减少扩散限制来增强其整体性能。

[2] "Analogous to studies by Ryoo and co-workers10, who showed that hierarchical zeolites that possess a high external surface area markedly reduce external coking, we demonstrate a similar effect for finned catalysts, and focus on two common 3D medium-pore zeolites: ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework)."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including both chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. 

In terms of morphological characteristics, the introduction of fins on zeolite catalysts has been shown to substantially improve mass transport properties. These finned structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals, with sizes comparable to that of the fin itself. This modification strategy enhances the catalytic efficiency by reducing internal diffusion limitations.

The increased external surface area provided by the fins has been demonstrated to markedly reduce external coking, similar to the effect observed in hierarchical zeolites. This is particularly beneficial for common 3D medium-pore zeolites like ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework).

In terms of chemical qualities, the acid-exchanged (H-form) of the zeolites plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity. Both seed and finned samples of H-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-5 showed similar initial catalyst activity in the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction, indicating that the acid sites remain accessible and active throughout the catalyst structure, including both the exterior fins and the interior.

The presence of fins on the zeolite catalysts resulted in a significant improvement in catalyst lifetime, with an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation observed for both crystal topologies. This enhancement in catalyst stability is a direct result of the optimized morphological characteristics.

These findings suggest that modifying the support structure of zeolite catalysts by introducing fins is an effective strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties. This approach enhances mass transport, reduces coking, extends catalyst lifetime, and maintains acid site accessibility, all of which contribute to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。

在形态特征方面，在沸石催化剂上引入鳍状结构已被证明可以大大改善传质性能。这些带鳍结构表现为伪纳米晶体，其尺寸与鳍本身的尺寸相当。这种改进策略通过减少内部扩散限制来提高催化效率。

鳍状结构提供的增加的外部表面积已被证明可以显著减少外部积碳，类似于分级沸石中观察到的效果。这对常见的三维中孔沸石如ZSM-11（MEL框架）和ZSM-5（MFI框架）特别有利。

在化学性质方面，沸石的酸交换形式（H形式）在其催化活性中起着至关重要的作用。H-ZSM-11和H-ZSM-5的种子样品和鳍状样品在甲醇制烃（MTH）反应中显示出相似的初始催化活性，表明酸性位点在整个催化剂结构中（包括外部鳍和内部）仍然可以接触并保持活性。

沸石催化剂上的鳍状结构显著提高了催化剂寿命，两种晶体拓扑结构的失活速率都减少了约三倍。这种催化剂稳定性的提高是优化形态特征的直接结果。

这些发现表明，通过引入鳍状结构来修改沸石催化剂的支撑结构是优化其物理化学性质的有效策略。这种方法可以增强传质、减少积碳、延长催化剂寿命并保持酸性位点的可接触性，所有这些都有助于提高脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。
