[1] "There is growing evidence for the advantages of synthesizing nanosized zeolites with markedly reduced internal diffusion limitations for enhanced performances in catalysis and adsorption."

[2] "Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin."

[3] "TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst."

[4] "For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime."

[5] "The UVvis spectra for H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3f) reveal equivalent internal coke between seed and finned samples; however, there is a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke for the finned sample, which suggests the presence of external protrusions leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The literature discusses the impact of zeolite catalyst morphology on catalytic performance, specifically focusing on the effects of introducing finned structures to zeolite crystals.

Morphological modifications, such as the creation of finned zeolites, can substantially improve mass transport properties and reduce internal diffusion limitations. This enhancement in mass transport leads to improved catalytic performance, including extended catalyst lifetime and reduced deactivation rates.

The finned structure allows reactions to occur both on the exterior protrusions and within the interior of the catalyst, maintaining similar initial catalytic activity to conventional seed catalysts. However, the finned structure provides significant advantages in terms of catalyst longevity and resistance to deactivation.

Support modification strategies, such as the introduction of fins on zeolite crystals, can be employed to optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These modifications result in reduced external coke formation, which is a common cause of catalyst deactivation. The finned structure leads to less accumulation of polyaromatics at the pore mouths, contributing to the extended catalyst lifetime.

While the literature does not directly address acid strength and stability, it suggests that the morphological modifications preserve the essential chemical properties of the zeolite catalysts while enhancing their overall performance through improved mass transport and reduced diffusion limitations.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。文献讨论了沸石催化剂形态对催化性能的影响，特别关注了在沸石晶体上引入鳍状结构的效果。

形态修饰，如创建鳍状沸石，可以大幅改善质量传输性能并减少内部扩散限制。这种质量传输的增强导致了催化性能的改善，包括延长催化剂寿命和降低失活率。

鳍状结构允许反应同时在外部突起和催化剂内部发生，保持了与传统种子催化剂相似的初始催化活性。然而，鳍状结构在催化剂寿命和抗失活性方面提供了显著优势。

支持体修饰策略，如在沸石晶体上引入鳍，可以用来优化催化效率和选择性。这些修饰导致外部焦炭形成减少，而外部焦炭形成是催化剂失活的常见原因。鳍状结构导致孔口处多芳烃的积累减少，有助于延长催化剂寿命。

虽然文献没有直接提到酸强度和稳定性，但它暗示了形态修饰保留了沸石催化剂的基本化学性质，同时通过改善质量传输和减少扩散限制来增强其整体性能。
