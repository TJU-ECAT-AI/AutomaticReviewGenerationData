[1] "Molecular modelling and time-resolved titration experiments of finned zeolites probe internal diffusion and reveal substantial improvements in mass transport, consistent with catalytic tests of a model reaction, which show that these structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to that of the fin."

[2] "Analogous to studies by Ryoo and co-workers10, who showed that hierarchical zeolites that possess a high external surface area markedly reduce external coking, we demonstrate a similar effect for finned catalysts, and focus on two common 3D medium-pore zeolites: ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework)."

[3] "To substantiate the enhanced mass-transport properties of zeolites after secondary growth, we assessed the performance of the acid-exchanged (H-form) seed and finned samples in the MTH reaction at subcomplete methanol conversion (6090%)."

[4] "TOS analysis of both seed and finned H-ZSM-11 (Fig. 3a) and H-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3b) samples reveals similar catalyst activity (that is, a nearly identical starting conversion). This suggests that the reactions in finned samples are not solely restricted to the exterior protrusions, but also occur within the interior of the catalyst."

[5] "For both crystal topologies, we observed an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation, which thus confirms that the presence of fins markedly extends the catalyst lifetime."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including both chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. 

In terms of morphological characteristics, the introduction of fins on zeolite catalysts has been shown to substantially improve mass transport properties. These finned structures behave as pseudo-nanocrystals, with sizes comparable to that of the fin itself. This modification strategy enhances the catalytic efficiency by reducing internal diffusion limitations.

The increased external surface area provided by the fins has been demonstrated to markedly reduce external coking, similar to the effect observed in hierarchical zeolites. This is particularly beneficial for common 3D medium-pore zeolites like ZSM-11 (MEL framework) and ZSM-5 (MFI framework).

In terms of chemical qualities, the acid-exchanged (H-form) of the zeolites plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity. Both seed and finned samples of H-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-5 showed similar initial catalyst activity in the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction, indicating that the acid sites remain accessible and active throughout the catalyst structure, including both the exterior fins and the interior.

The presence of fins on the zeolite catalysts resulted in a significant improvement in catalyst lifetime, with an approximate threefold reduction in the rate of deactivation observed for both crystal topologies. This enhancement in catalyst stability is a direct result of the optimized morphological characteristics.

These findings suggest that modifying the support structure of zeolite catalysts by introducing fins is an effective strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties. This approach enhances mass transport, reduces coking, extends catalyst lifetime, and maintains acid site accessibility, all of which contribute to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。

在形态特征方面，在沸石催化剂上引入鳍状结构已被证明可以大大改善传质性能。这些带鳍结构表现为伪纳米晶体，其尺寸与鳍本身的尺寸相当。这种改进策略通过减少内部扩散限制来提高催化效率。

鳍状结构提供的增加的外部表面积已被证明可以显著减少外部积碳，类似于分级沸石中观察到的效果。这对常见的三维中孔沸石如ZSM-11（MEL框架）和ZSM-5（MFI框架）特别有利。

在化学性质方面，沸石的酸交换形式（H形式）在其催化活性中起着至关重要的作用。H-ZSM-11和H-ZSM-5的种子样品和鳍状样品在甲醇制烃（MTH）反应中显示出相似的初始催化活性，表明酸性位点在整个催化剂结构中（包括外部鳍和内部）仍然可以接触并保持活性。

沸石催化剂上的鳍状结构显著提高了催化剂寿命，两种晶体拓扑结构的失活速率都减少了约三倍。这种催化剂稳定性的提高是优化形态特征的直接结果。

这些发现表明，通过引入鳍状结构来修改沸石催化剂的支撑结构是优化其物理化学性质的有效策略。这种方法可以增强传质、减少积碳、延长催化剂寿命并保持酸性位点的可接触性，所有这些都有助于提高脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。
