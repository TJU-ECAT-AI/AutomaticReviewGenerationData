[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions. This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on the Co sites."

[4] "The diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The support material, particularly Al2O3, is crucial due to its structural advantages and stability. The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

Morphological characteristics, such as the sheet-like structure of γ-Al2O3, can enhance catalyst performance. For instance, γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can effectively disperse and stabilize metal clusters due to strong metal-support interactions.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling the structure of the support: Using methods like hydrothermal synthesis to create sheet-shaped catalysts can improve catalytic performance.

2. Tailoring the surface acidity: Modifying the low-coordinated Al sites can help control propane adsorption and activation, as well as reduce coke deposition.

3. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Designing supports that promote strong interactions with the active metal species can improve dispersion and stability of the active sites.

4. Controlling active site structure: Developing methods to create uniform, isolated active sites (e.g., Co2+ in this case) can improve selectivity by reducing side reactions caused by diverse active site types.

By carefully tailoring these physicochemical properties through support modification, it is possible to develop catalysts with improved efficiency and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.
