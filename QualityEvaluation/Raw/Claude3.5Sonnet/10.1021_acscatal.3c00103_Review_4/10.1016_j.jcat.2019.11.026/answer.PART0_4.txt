[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites"

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "In addition to being an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3 showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the surface active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene"

[4] "Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: The surface acidity of Al2O3 at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions.
- Stability: Al2O3 is widely used as a support due to its structural stability, which helps maintain catalyst performance over time.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface structure: Coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on γ-Al2O3 act as anchor points for dispersing active metal sites.
- Nanosheet morphology: γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can effectively disperse and stabilize metal nanoclusters.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Tailoring surface acidity: Controlling the density and strength of acid sites on Al2O3 can improve propane activation while minimizing side reactions and coke formation.

2. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Creating strong interactions between the metal and Al2O3 support can improve metal dispersion and stability.

3. Developing nanostructured supports: Synthesizing Al2O3 with specific morphologies (e.g., nanosheets) can increase the availability of desirable surface sites for metal anchoring.

4. Modifying surface chemistry: Eliminating hydroxyl groups on Al2O3 can create coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites that act as active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Optimizing pore structure: Tailoring the pore structure of Al2O3 can improve reactant diffusion and product desorption, enhancing overall catalytic efficiency.

By employing these strategies, researchers can optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts to enhance their efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.
