[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions. This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on the Co sites."

[4] "The diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[5] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The support material, particularly Al2O3, is crucial due to its structural advantages and stability. The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

Morphological characteristics, such as the sheet-like structure of γ-Al2O3, can enhance catalyst performance. For instance, γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can effectively disperse and stabilize metal clusters due to strong metal-support interactions.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling the structure of the support: Using methods like hydrothermal synthesis to create sheet-shaped catalysts can improve catalytic performance.

2. Tailoring the surface acidity: Modifying the low-coordinated Al sites can help control propane adsorption and activation, as well as reduce coke deposition.

3. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Designing supports that promote strong interactions with the active metal species can improve dispersion and stability of the active sites.

4. Controlling active site structure: Developing methods to create uniform, isolated active sites (e.g., Co2+ in this case) can improve selectivity by reducing side reactions caused by diverse active site types.

By carefully tailoring these physicochemical properties through support modification, it is possible to develop catalysts with improved efficiency and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。

支撑材料，特别是Al2O3，由于其结构优势和稳定性而至关重要。低配位Al位点的表面酸性影响了丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的丙烷吸附、活化和积碳沉积。

形态特征，如γ-Al2O3的片状结构，可以提高催化剂性能。例如，含有五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片可以由于金属-支撑物之间的强相互作用而有效分散和稳定金属簇。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种支撑物修饰策略：

1. 控制支撑物的结构：使用水热合成等方法制造片状催化剂可以提高催化性能。

2. 调整表面酸性：修饰低配位Al位点可以帮助控制丙烷吸附和活化，并减少积碳沉积。

3. 增强金属-支撑物相互作用：设计能促进与活性金属物种强相互作用的支撑物可以改善活性位点的分散性和稳定性。

4. 控制活性位点结构：开发创建均匀、孤立活性位点（如本例中的Co2+）的方法可以通过减少由多种活性位点类型引起的副反应来提高选择性。

通过仔细调整这些物理化学性质，通过支撑物修饰，有可能开发出具有改进的效率和选择性的脱氢反应催化剂。
