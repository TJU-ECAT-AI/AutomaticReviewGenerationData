[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites"

[2] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[3] "the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[4] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction. The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions.
- Stability: The structural and catalytic stabilities of CoAl2O3 catalysts are crucial for their performance.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Sheet-like morphology: Sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method efficiently catalyze PDH reactions.
- Nanosheet structure: γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can disperse and stabilize metal nanoclusters.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Tailoring Al2O3 structure: Modifying the structure of Al2O3 can improve catalytic performance in PDH reactions.
- Enhancing metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metals and the Al2O3 support lead to better dispersion and stabilization of active sites.
- Using coordinately unsaturated sites: Exploiting unsaturated Al3+ sites on γ-Al2O3 facets as anchor points for atomically dispersed metal sites.

These strategies can optimize catalyst properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.
