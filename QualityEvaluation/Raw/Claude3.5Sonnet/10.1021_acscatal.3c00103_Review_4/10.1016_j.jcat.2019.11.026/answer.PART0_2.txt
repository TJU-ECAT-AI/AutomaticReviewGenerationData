[1] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction"

[3] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[4] "the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[5] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The support material, particularly Al2O3, is crucial due to its structural advantages and stability. The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions. 

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Creating specific interactions between the support and active metal, such as the Ga2O3-Al2O3 interaction that allows for high dispersion of tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, enhancing activity and stability.

2. Tailoring the support morphology, such as synthesizing γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with a high percentage of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites, which can better disperse and stabilize metal clusters through strong metal-support interactions.

3. Employing synthesis methods that control the structure and morphology, such as the one-step hydrothermal method used to create sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts.

These strategies aim to enhance metal dispersion, strengthen metal-support interactions, and optimize the surface properties of the support, ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

支撑材料，特别是Al2O3，由于其结构优势和稳定性而至关重要。低配位Al位点的表面酸性影响丙烷在PDH反应中的吸附、活化和积碳沉积。

优化这些性质的支撑体修饰策略包括：

1. 创造支撑体和活性金属之间的特定相互作用，例如Ga2O3-Al2O3相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子高度分散，提高活性和稳定性。

2. 调整支撑体形态，如合成具有高比例五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片，通过强金属-支撑体相互作用更好地分散和稳定金属簇。

3. 采用控制结构和形态的合成方法，如用于制备片状CoAl2O3HT催化剂的一步水热法。

这些策略旨在提高金属分散度，增强金属-支撑体相互作用，并优化支撑体的表面性质，最终导致脱氢反应中催化性能的改善。
