[1] "γ-Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."

[2] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction"

[3] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support"

[4] "the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."

[5] "Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

The support material, particularly γ-Al2O3, is essential due to its structural advantages and stability. The surface acidity at low-coordinated Al sites affects propane adsorption, activation, and coke deposition in PDH reactions.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Creating specific interactions between the support and active metal species. For example, the interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows for high dispersion of tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, enhancing activity and stability.

2. Tailoring the support structure to stabilize active metal sites. γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with penta-coordinated Al3+ sites can disperse and stabilize bimetallic nanoclusters through strong metal-support interactions.

3. Controlling the morphology of the support. Sheet-shaped structures, as demonstrated by the CoAl2O3HT catalysts synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal method, can efficiently catalyze PDH reactions.

4. Modifying surface properties to enhance metal dispersion and inhibit coke formation. The diversity and complexity of Al2O3 structure can be tailored to optimize adsorption properties and minimize unwanted side reactions.

By employing these strategies, researchers can design catalysts with improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。

支撑材料，特别是γ-Al2O3，由于其结构优势和稳定性而至关重要。低配位Al位点的表面酸性影响丙烷吸附、活化和PDH反应中的积碳沉积。

优化这些性质的支撑体改性策略包括：

1. 创造支撑体和活性金属物种之间的特定相互作用。例如，Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的相互作用允许四面体Ga3+阳离子高度分散，提高活性和稳定性。

2. 调整支撑体结构以稳定活性金属位点。含有五配位Al3+位点的γ-Al2O3纳米片可以通过强金属-支撑体相互作用分散和稳定双金属纳米簇。

3. 控制支撑体的形态。如使用一步水热法合成的片状CoAl2O3HT催化剂所示，片状结构可以有效催化PDH反应。

4. 修改表面性质以增强金属分散和抑制积碳形成。Al2O3结构的多样性和复杂性可以进行调整，以优化吸附性能并最小化不必要的副反应。

通过采用这些策略，研究人员可以设计出具有改进效率、选择性和稳定性的脱氢反应催化剂。
