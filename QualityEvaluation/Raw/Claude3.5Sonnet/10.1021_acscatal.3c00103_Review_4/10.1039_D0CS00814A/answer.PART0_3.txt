[1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "The supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred."

[3] "Doping with another component could inhibit the transformation process. For example, B. Ersoy et al. observed that the addition of La2O3 to solgel derived alumina gels increased the γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 transformation temperature to 1200 C."

[4] "Experimental evidence indicated that appropriate Mg addition promotes the dispersion of V2O5 nanoparticles from three dimensional to two dimensional VOx species which extremely reduce coke deposition and then enhance stability on a large scale."

[5] "Although acidic sites are also undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics such as surface area and pore size distribution, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties:

1. Increasing surface area and creating uniform pore size distribution: This enhances the dispersion of active sites and improves mass transfer.

2. Doping with stabilizing components: For example, adding La2O3 to alumina gels can inhibit the transformation from γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3, maintaining the desired crystal structure at higher temperatures.

3. Promoting dispersion of active species: Appropriate addition of elements like Mg can promote the dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g., V2O5) from 3D to 2D structures, reducing coke deposition and enhancing stability.

4. Modifying acidity: Doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca, and Mg can neutralize undesirable acidic sites on the support, which may lead to unwanted side reactions.

5. Tailoring metal-support interactions: Proper modification of supports can enhance the interaction between active metal species and the support, leading to better dispersion and stability of the active phase.

These strategies aim to create catalysts with optimal surface properties, stability, and activity for dehydrogenation reactions, ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance in terms of conversion, selectivity, and longevity.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征如表面积和孔径分布，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。

可以采用以下支持体修饰策略来优化这些性质：

1. 增加表面积和创造均匀的孔径分布：这可以增强活性位点的分散性并改善质量传递。

2. 掺杂稳定组分：例如，向氧化铝凝胶中添加La2O3可以抑制γ-Al2O3向α-Al2O3的转变，在更高温度下保持所需的晶体结构。

3. 促进活性物种的分散：适当添加Mg等元素可以促进金属氧化物纳米粒子（如V2O5）从3D结构向2D结构的分散，减少积炭沉积并提高稳定性。

4. 调节酸度：用K、Na、Ca和Mg等碱金属掺杂可以中和支持体上不需要的酸性位点，这些酸性位点可能导致不必要的副反应。

5. 调整金属-载体相互作用：适当修饰载体可以增强活性金属物种与载体之间的相互作用，从而提高活性相的分散性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在创造具有最佳表面性质、稳定性和活性的脱氢反应催化剂，最终在转化率、选择性和寿命方面提高催化性能。
