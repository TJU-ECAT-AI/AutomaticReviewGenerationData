[1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "Differing from metal-based catalysts, the Lewis acid MO sites in metal oxides can also effectively activate the propane CH bonds."

[3] "The acidbase pairs of metal oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are deactivated owing to coke deposition, and as for Pt-based catalysts, periodical regeneration become indispensable."

[4] "Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it. Due to the enhanced interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be improved to a large extent."

[5] "This kind of modification decreases the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the electronic properties of Pt."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For metal oxide catalysts, Lewis acid sites are important for activating propane C-H bonds. However, these catalysts can suffer from deactivation due to coke deposition on acid-base pairs.

Morphological characteristics also impact catalyst performance. The dispersion of active metal sites on the support surface is a key factor affecting activity and stability. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties and enhance catalytic performance. Some effective approaches include:

1. Introducing metal oxides like TiO2 and CeO2 into Al2O3 supports to enhance the interaction between Pt and the support, improving activity, stability, and coking resistance.

2. Modifying supports to decrease acidity, which can help reduce unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

3. Tuning the dispersion and electronic properties of active metal sites through support modifications.

4. Using promoters or dopants to alter the surface chemistry and structural properties of the catalyst.

5. Controlling particle size and morphology to maximize the number of active sites and minimize deactivation.

By carefully tailoring these physicochemical properties through support modification and catalyst design, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions with improved stability and longer lifetimes.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。对于金属氧化物催化剂，路易斯酸位对于活化丙烷C-H键很重要。然而，这些催化剂可能因酸碱对上的积碳沉积而失活。

形态特征也影响催化剂性能。活性金属位点在载体表面的分散是影响活性和稳定性的关键因素。可以采用载体改性策略来优化这些性质并提高催化性能。一些有效的方法包括：

1. 将TiO2和CeO2等金属氧化物引入Al2O3载体，以增强Pt与载体之间的相互作用，提高活性、稳定性和抗积碳能力。

2. 改性载体以降低酸度，这有助于减少不必要的副反应和积碳形成。

3. 通过载体改性调节活性金属位点的分散和电子性质。

4. 使用助剂或掺杂剂改变催化剂的表面化学和结构性质。

5. 控制粒径和形貌以最大化活性位点数量并最小化失活。

通过仔细调整这些物理化学性质，包括载体改性和催化剂设计，研究人员可以开发出更高效、更选择性的丙烷脱氢反应催化剂，具有更好的稳定性和更长的使用寿命。
