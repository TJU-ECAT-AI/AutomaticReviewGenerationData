[1] "The acidic sites are undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg."

[2] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI"

[3] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."

[4] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."

[5] "Additionally, doping can also help increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Acidic sites on catalysts can lead to undesirable side reactions. Modifying supports by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca, and Mg can neutralize these acidic sites, improving selectivity and reducing coke formation.

2. Stability: The tendency of catalysts to sinter or coke at high temperatures affects their long-term performance. Supports that can trap metal atoms (like CeO2 for Pt) through strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) enhance thermal stability.

3. Dispersion: High dispersion of active metal sites increases catalytic efficiency. Support materials with high surface areas help disperse active metals more effectively.

4. Morphology: The confinement effect of certain support structures can prevent sintering by spatially constraining metal clusters.

5. Chemical composition: Adding promoters or modifying supports can enhance catalyst performance. For example, magnesium addition can stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Doping with alkali metals to neutralize acidity
2. Using supports with strong metal-support interactions (e.g., CeO2 for Pt)
3. Selecting high surface area supports for better metal dispersion
4. Employing supports with confining structures to prevent sintering
5. Adding stabilizing elements (like Mg for VOx/Al2O3) to improve catalyst durability

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions by tailoring the physicochemical properties of the catalysts.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸度：催化剂上的酸性位点可能导致不期望的副反应。通过掺杂钾、钠、钙和镁等碱金属来改性载体可以中和这些酸性位点，提高选择性并减少积碳形成。

2. 稳定性：催化剂在高温下烧结或积碳的倾向影响其长期性能。能够通过强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）捕获金属原子的载体（如用于铂的二氧化铈）可以增强热稳定性。

3. 分散度：活性金属位点的高分散度可以提高催化效率。具有高比表面积的载体材料有助于更有效地分散活性金属。

4. 形态：某些载体结构的限域效应可以通过空间限制金属簇来防止烧结。

5. 化学成分：添加助剂或改性载体可以增强催化剂性能。例如，添加镁可以稳定用于丙烷脱氢的VOx/Al2O3催化剂。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 掺杂碱金属以中和酸度
2. 使用具有强金属-载体相互作用的载体（如用于铂的二氧化铈）
3. 选择高比表面积的载体以获得更好的金属分散度
4. 采用具有限域结构的载体以防止烧结
5. 添加稳定元素（如用于VOx/Al2O3的镁）以提高催化剂耐久性

这些策略旨在通过调整催化剂的物理化学性质来提高脱氢反应中的催化效率、选择性和稳定性。
