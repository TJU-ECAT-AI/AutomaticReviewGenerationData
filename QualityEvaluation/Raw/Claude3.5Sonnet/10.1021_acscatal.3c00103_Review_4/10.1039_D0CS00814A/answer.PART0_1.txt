[1] "The acidbase pairs of metal oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are deactivated owing to coke deposition, and as for Pt-based catalysts, periodical regeneration become indispensable."

[2] "Although metal oxides (such as Al2O3 and ZrO2) have been widely studied as supports for CrOx and VOx catalysts, the stability is still too low due to the strong acidity of supports."

[3] "Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus enhance the stability of the catalyst."

[4] "An appropriate promoter that improves the overall activity, selectivity, and anti-coking capability is still under discovery."

[5] "Doping with another component could inhibit the transformation process. For example, B. Ersoy et al. observed that the addition of La2O3 to solgel derived alumina gels increased the γ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 transformation temperature to 1200 C."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Strong acidity of supports like Al2O3 and ZrO2 can lead to lower stability of catalysts due to coke deposition. Acidbase pairs on metal oxide catalysts are deactivated by coke formation.

2. Surface area: High surface area of supports like alumina helps disperse platinum clusters, enhancing catalyst stability.

3. Mechanical strength and thermal stability: These properties of alumina make it a good support for platinum-based catalysts, improving overall catalyst performance.

4. Morphology: The structure and dispersion of active components on the support affect catalyst efficiency and selectivity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Doping: Adding components like La2O3 to alumina can inhibit phase transformations, maintaining the desired crystal structure at higher temperatures.

2. Promoter addition: Appropriate promoters can improve activity, selectivity, and anti-coking capability, though finding the ideal promoter is still a challenge.

3. Acidity control: Modifying support acidity through various methods can help reduce coke formation and improve catalyst stability.

4. Surface area optimization: Techniques to maintain or increase support surface area can enhance active component dispersion and overall catalytic performance.

These strategies aim to balance the various physicochemical properties to achieve optimal catalyst performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 酸度：Al2O3和ZrO2等支撑材料的强酸性会导致催化剂稳定性降低，主要是由于焦炭沉积。金属氧化物催化剂上的酸碱对会因焦炭形成而失活。

2. 比表面积：像氧化铝这样的高比表面积支撑材料有助于分散铂簇，提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 机械强度和热稳定性：氧化铝的这些特性使其成为铂基催化剂的良好支撑材料，提高了整体催化剂性能。

4. 形态：活性组分在支撑材料上的结构和分散性影响催化剂的效率和选择性。

优化这些性质的支撑材料改性策略包括：

1. 掺杂：向氧化铝中添加La2O3等组分可以抑制相变，在更高温度下保持所需的晶体结构。

2. 助剂添加：适当的助剂可以提高活性、选择性和抗焦性能，但找到理想的助剂仍是一个挑战。

3. 酸度控制：通过各种方法调节支撑材料的酸度可以帮助减少焦炭形成，提高催化剂稳定性。

4. 比表面积优化：维持或增加支撑材料比表面积的技术可以增强活性组分的分散性和整体催化性能。

这些策略旨在平衡各种物理化学性质，以实现脱氢反应中催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面的最佳性能。
