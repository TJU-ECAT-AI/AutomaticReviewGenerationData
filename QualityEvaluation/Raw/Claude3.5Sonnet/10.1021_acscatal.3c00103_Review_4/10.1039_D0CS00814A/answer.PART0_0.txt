[1] "The textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts."

[2] "Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price."

[3] "Additionally, doping can also help increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al."

[4] "Although acidic supports are also undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg. It is revealed that the amount of acidic sites of CrZrO catalysts is reduced for K (0.2%, 0.5%, or 1%) doping, leading to an enhanced C3H6 selectivity and resistance to coke formation in PDH reaction."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include specific surface area, acid-base properties, thermal stability, and mechanical strength. These properties affect the dispersion of active components, reaction kinetics, and catalyst longevity.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Doping with alkaline elements: Adding alkali metals like K, Na, Ca, and Mg can reduce the acidity of supports, leading to improved propylene selectivity and resistance to coke formation.

2. Incorporation of other metal oxides: Doping with metal oxides like MgO can help increase the dispersion of active species (e.g., VOx) and stabilize the catalyst structure.

3. Tuning the support's surface area and porosity: Using high surface area materials like alumina provides better dispersion of active sites and improved catalytic performance.

4. Enhancing thermal stability: Selecting supports with excellent thermal stability, such as alumina, helps maintain catalyst structure and activity under high-temperature reaction conditions.

5. Modifying mechanical properties: Choosing supports with suitable mechanical strength ensures catalyst durability in industrial applications.

By carefully tailoring these properties through various modification strategies, researchers can develop catalysts with optimized physicochemical characteristics, leading to improved efficiency, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括比表面积、酸碱性质、热稳定性和机械强度。这些性质影响活性组分的分散度、反应动力学和催化剂寿命。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种载体改性策略：

1. 碱性元素掺杂：添加K、Na、Ca和Mg等碱金属可以降低载体的酸度，从而提高丙烯选择性和抗积碳能力。

2. 引入其他金属氧化物：掺入MgO等金属氧化物可以帮助增加活性物种（如VOx）的分散度，并稳定催化剂结构。

3. 调节载体的比表面积和孔隙度：使用氧化铝等高比表面积材料可以提供更好的活性位点分散度和改善的催化性能。

4. 提高热稳定性：选择具有优异热稳定性的载体（如氧化铝）有助于在高温反应条件下维持催化剂结构和活性。

5. 改善机械性能：选择具有适当机械强度的载体确保催化剂在工业应用中的耐久性。

通过仔细调整这些性质并采用各种改性策略，研究人员可以开发出具有优化物理化学特性的催化剂，从而在丙烷脱氢反应中实现更高的效率、选择性和稳定性。
