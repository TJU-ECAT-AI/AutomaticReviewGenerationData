[1] "The textural properties such as specific surface area, acidbase properties, and thermal stability have been demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts."

[2] "Alumina has been most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price."

[3] "Additionally, doping can also help increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al."

[4] "Although acidic supports are also undesirable which can be poisoned by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg. It is revealed that the amount of acidic sites of CrZrO catalysts is reduced for K (0.2%, 0.5%, or 1%) doping, leading to an enhanced C3H6 selectivity and resistance to coke formation in PDH reaction."

[2] "Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic form due to the stronger SMSI"

[3] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter (e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects."

[4] "The confinement situation offered by a support can provide a high surface area for dispersing active metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding from sintering."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Acidic sites on catalysts can lead to undesirable side reactions. Modifying supports by doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca, and Mg can neutralize these acidic sites, improving selectivity and reducing coke formation.

2. Stability: The tendency of catalysts to sinter or coke at high temperatures affects their long-term performance. Supports that can trap metal atoms (like CeO2 for Pt) through strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) enhance thermal stability.

3. Dispersion: High dispersion of active metal sites increases catalytic efficiency. Support materials with high surface areas help disperse active metals more effectively.

4. Morphology: The confinement effect of certain support structures can prevent sintering by spatially constraining metal clusters.

5. Chemical composition: Adding promoters or modifying supports can enhance catalyst performance. For example, magnesium addition can stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Doping with alkali metals to neutralize acidity
2. Using supports with strong metal-support interactions (e.g., CeO2 for Pt)
3. Selecting high surface area supports for better metal dispersion
4. Employing supports with confining structures to prevent sintering
5. Adding stabilizing elements (like Mg for VOx/Al2O3) to improve catalyst durability

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions by tailoring the physicochemical properties of the catalysts.
