[1] "Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."

[2] "To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9. The propane conversions of Cr/Z-5 catalysts improve with the increase of the amount of acidic sites, while their propylene selectivity and yield decrease with the increase of the amount of acidic sites"

[3] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance."

[4] "The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: The amount and strength of acidic sites affect propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and yield. Moderate acidity is beneficial, while excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions.

2. Porosity and surface area: High surface area and well-defined pores provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of active species, enhancing catalytic activity and stability.

3. Metal dispersion: High dispersion of metal species on the support contributes to improved catalytic performance.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between the metal and support enhance catalyst stability and activity.

5. Acid site type: Both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites play important roles, with Brønsted acid sites being crucial for propane adsorption and activation.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of zeolite supports to achieve the optimal balance of acidity.

2. Using high-silica zeolites to moderate acidity and improve stability.

3. Employing wet impregnation methods to achieve high metal dispersion.

4. Tailoring pore structure and surface area through synthesis conditions or post-synthesis treatments.

5. Modifying acid sites through ion exchange or doping (e.g., Na+ doping) to fine-tune catalyst acidity.

These strategies aim to create catalysts with optimal physicochemical properties, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸度：酸性位点的数量和强度影响丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和产率。适度的酸度有利于反应，而过高的酸度可能导致不希望的副反应。

2. 孔隙度和比表面积：高比表面积和明确定义的孔道为活性物种的分散和稳定提供了特殊环境，从而提高催化活性和稳定性。

3. 金属分散度：载体上金属物种的高分散度有助于提高催化性能。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：金属与载体之间的强相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性和活性。

5. 酸性位点类型：路易斯酸位点和布朗斯特酸位点都起重要作用，其中布朗斯特酸位点对丙烷吸附和活化至关重要。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 控制分子筛载体的SiO2/Al2O3比例，以达到酸度的最佳平衡。

2. 使用高硅分子筛来调节酸度并提高稳定性。

3. 采用湿法浸渍方法实现金属的高度分散。

4. 通过合成条件或后合成处理来调整孔结构和比表面积。

5. 通过离子交换或掺杂（如Na+掺杂）来修饰酸性位点，以微调催化剂的酸度。

这些策略旨在创造具有最佳物理化学性质的催化剂，从而在脱氢反应中提高催化效率、选择性和稳定性。
