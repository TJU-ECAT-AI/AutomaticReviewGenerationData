[1] "The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique"

[2] "Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports."

[3] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance."

[4] "In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."

[5] "Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: The acidity of the catalyst, particularly the presence of Brønsted acid sites, plays a crucial role in propane adsorption and C-H bond activation. The strength and density of acid sites, which can be measured by NH3-TPD, affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

2. Surface area and pore structure: High surface area and well-defined pores, as found in HZSM-5 zeolites, provide an ideal environment for the dispersion and stabilization of active species (e.g., Cr), leading to improved catalytic activity and stability.

3. Metal-support interactions: The interaction between the active metal species (e.g., Cr) and the support (e.g., HZSM-5) influences the catalyst's performance. Strong metal-support interactions can enhance the stability and dispersion of active sites.

4. SiO2/Al2O3 ratio: In zeolite supports like HZSM-5, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio affects the acidity and propane adsorption properties of the catalyst, which in turn influences its catalytic performance.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adjusting the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of zeolite supports to control acidity and adsorption properties.

2. Using high-silica zeolites (e.g., HZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) to achieve an optimal balance of acidity and stability.

3. Employing ion exchange techniques (e.g., Na+ doping) to modify the acidity of the support and tune catalyst performance.

4. Optimizing the metal loading amount to achieve high dispersion and avoid the formation of large metal oxide particles.

5. Selecting supports with high surface area and well-defined pore structures to enhance the dispersion and stabilization of active species.

By carefully controlling these physicochemical properties through support modification, catalysts can be designed with enhanced efficiency and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸度：催化剂的酸度，特别是Brønsted酸位的存在，在丙烷吸附和C-H键活化中起着关键作用。通过NH3-TPD可测量的酸位强度和密度影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

2. 比表面积和孔结构：高比表面积和明确的孔结构，如HZSM-5沸石所具有的特性，为活性物种（如Cr）的分散和稳定提供了理想的环境，从而提高了催化活性和稳定性。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：活性金属物种（如Cr）与载体（如HZSM-5）之间的相互作用影响催化剂的性能。强金属-载体相互作用可以增强活性位点的稳定性和分散性。

4. SiO2/Al2O3比：在HZSM-5等沸石载体中，SiO2/Al2O3比影响催化剂的酸度和丙烷吸附性能，进而影响其催化性能。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 调整沸石载体的SiO2/Al2O3比以控制酸度和吸附性能。

2. 使用高硅沸石（如SiO2/Al2O3 = 260的HZSM-5）以实现酸度和稳定性的最佳平衡。

3. 采用离子交换技术（如Na+掺杂）来修饰载体的酸度并调节催化剂性能。

4. 优化金属负载量以实现高分散性并避免形成大的金属氧化物颗粒。

5. 选择具有高比表面积和明确孔结构的载体，以增强活性物种的分散和稳定性。

通过仔细控制这些物理化学性质的载体改性，可以设计出具有增强效率和选择性的脱氢反应催化剂。
