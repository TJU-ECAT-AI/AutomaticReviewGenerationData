[1] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."

[2] "Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

[3] "It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."

[4] "The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio"

[5] "Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Brønsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance C-H bond activation, leading to higher catalytic performance. However, the acidity needs to be carefully controlled, as too high acidity can lead to undesirable side reactions.

2. Surface area and porosity: High surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability.

3. Metal dispersion: High dispersion of Cr species on the support contributes to better catalytic performance.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between the metal (Cr) and the support (HZSM-5) contribute to the stability and activity of the catalyst.

5. Support composition: The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the HZSM-5 support affects the acidity and thus the catalytic performance. Higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratios generally lead to lower acidity.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, the following support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 to achieve suitable acidity.
2. Using high-silica HZSM-5 to provide moderate acidity and high stability.
3. Optimizing the metal loading to achieve high dispersion of active species.
4. Tailoring the pore structure of the support to facilitate reactant/product diffusion and metal dispersion.
5. Modifying the surface chemistry of the support to enhance metal-support interactions.

These strategies aim to create a catalyst with optimal balance between acidity, metal dispersion, and stability, leading to improved catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 酸度：HZSM-5分子筛中的Brønsted酸位可以增加丙烷吸附并增强C-H键活化，从而提高催化性能。然而，酸度需要仔细控制，因为过高的酸度可能导致不良的副反应。

2. 比表面积和孔隙度：HZSM-5分子筛的高比表面积和明确定义的孔道为Cr物种的分散和稳定提供了特殊环境，确保了高催化活性和稳定性。

3. 金属分散度：Cr物种在载体上的高分散度有助于提高催化性能。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：金属（Cr）和载体（HZSM-5）之间的强相互作用有助于催化剂的稳定性和活性。

5. 载体组成：HZSM-5载体的SiO2/Al2O3比影响其酸度，从而影响催化性能。较高的SiO2/Al2O3比通常会导致较低的酸度。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下载体改性策略：

1. 控制HZSM-5的SiO2/Al2O3比以获得适当的酸度。
2. 使用高硅HZSM-5以提供适度的酸度和高稳定性。
3. 优化金属负载量以实现活性物种的高分散度。
4. 调整载体的孔结构以促进反应物/产物扩散和金属分散。
5. 修饰载体的表面化学性质以增强金属-载体相互作用。

这些策略旨在创建一个在酸度、金属分散度和稳定性之间达到最佳平衡的催化剂，从而在脱氢反应中提高催化性能。
