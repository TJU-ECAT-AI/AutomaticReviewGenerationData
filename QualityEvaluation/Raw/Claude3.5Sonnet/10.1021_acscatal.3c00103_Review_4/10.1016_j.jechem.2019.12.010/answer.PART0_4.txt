The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acidity: Both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites play crucial roles. Brønsted acid sites in HZSM-5 are key for propane adsorption and activation, directly impacting catalytic performance.

2. Surface area and pore structure: High surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide an ideal environment for dispersing and stabilizing Cr species, leading to high catalytic activity and stability.

3. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species and the support enhance catalyst stability and performance.

4. Dispersion of active sites: Well-dispersed Cr species on the support surface contribute to higher catalytic activity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling SiO2/Al2O3 ratio: This affects the acidity of the support, which can be optimized for best performance.

2. Using high-silica HZSM-5: This provides a balance of acidity and stability.

3. Controlled metal loading: Optimizing the amount of Cr species loaded onto the support to achieve high dispersion without forming bulk Cr2O3.

4. Na+ doping: This can be used to modulate the acidity of the catalyst, though care must be taken as excessive Na+ can negatively impact performance.

5. Support selection: Choosing supports with high surface area and well-defined pore structures to enhance metal dispersion and stability.

These strategies aim to create catalysts with an optimal balance of acidity, metal dispersion, and stability, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸度：Lewis酸位和Brønsted酸位都起着关键作用。HZSM-5中的Brønsted酸位对丙烷吸附和活化至关重要，直接影响催化性能。

2. 比表面积和孔结构：HZSM-5沸石的高比表面积和定义良好的孔结构为Cr物种的分散和稳定提供了理想环境，导致高催化活性和稳定性。

3. 金属-载体相互作用：金属物种与载体之间的强相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性和性能。

4. 活性位点分散：在载体表面上良好分散的Cr物种有助于提高催化活性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 控制SiO2/Al2O3比例：这影响载体的酸度，可以优化以获得最佳性能。

2. 使用高硅HZSM-5：这提供了酸度和稳定性的平衡。

3. 控制金属负载：优化负载到载体上的Cr物种的数量，以实现高分散而不形成块状Cr2O3。

4. Na+掺杂：这可用于调节催化剂的酸度，但需要注意过量的Na+可能会对性能产生负面影响。

5. 载体选择：选择具有高比表面积和定义良好的孔结构的载体，以增强金属分散和稳定性。

这些策略旨在创造具有最佳酸度、金属分散和稳定性平衡的催化剂，从而在脱氢反应中提高催化效率和选择性。
