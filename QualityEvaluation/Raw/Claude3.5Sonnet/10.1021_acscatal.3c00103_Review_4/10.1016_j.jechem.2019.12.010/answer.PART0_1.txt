[1] "Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation."

[2] "Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability."

[3] "It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."

[4] "To further understand the acidic sites of Cr/Z-5 catalysts, here we designed a series of Na+ doping experiments according to previous studies"

[5] "Typically, ZSM-5 zeolites with controlled Na+ contents were prepared and used as supports for CrOx catalysts (i.e., 5%Cr/Z-5(260) + 1%Na and 5%Cr/NaZ-5(260) (Na content  2.3%) catalysts)."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Acid strength and type: Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite increase propane adsorption and enhance C-H bond activation, leading to higher catalytic performance.

2. Surface area and porosity: The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, ensuring high catalytic activity and stability.

3. Metal dispersion: High dispersion of Cr species on the support contributes to improved catalytic performance.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between Cr species and the HZSM-5 support enhance catalytic activity and stability.

5. Moderate acidity: A balance in acidity is crucial for optimal performance, as evidenced by NH3-TPD studies.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 to adjust acidity.

2. Na+ doping experiments to modify the acid sites and understand their role in catalytic performance.

3. Optimizing Cr loading to achieve high dispersion and avoid formation of bulk Cr2O3 particles.

4. Using high-silica HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) as a support to provide suitable acidity and porosity.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between acidity, metal dispersion, and support properties.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸强度和类型：HZSM-5沸石中的Brnsted酸位增加了丙烷吸附并增强了C-H键活化，从而提高了催化性能。

2. 比表面积和孔隙度：HZSM-5沸石的高比表面积和明确定义的孔道为Cr物种的分散和稳定提供了特殊环境，确保了高催化活性和稳定性。

3. 金属分散度：Cr物种在载体上的高分散度有助于提高催化性能。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：Cr物种与HZSM-5载体之间的强相互作用增强了催化活性和稳定性。

5. 适度的酸度：酸度的平衡对于最佳性能至关重要，这一点通过NH3-TPD研究得到证实。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 控制HZSM-5的SiO2/Al2O3比例以调节酸度。

2. 进行Na+掺杂实验以修饰酸位并了解它们在催化性能中的作用。

3. 优化Cr负载量以实现高分散度并避免形成体相Cr2O3颗粒。

4. 使用高硅HZSM-5（SiO2/Al2O3 = 260）作为载体，提供适当的酸度和孔隙度。

这些策略旨在通过优化酸度、金属分散度和载体性质之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。
