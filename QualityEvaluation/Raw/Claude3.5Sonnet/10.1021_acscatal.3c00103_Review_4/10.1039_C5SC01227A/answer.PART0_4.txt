[1] "Although the steam reforming process is now widely used in the modern chemical industry, other alternative routes to process methane are still quite challenging. Such alternative processes include, among others, the direct conversion of methane to other valuable chemicals or the dry CO2 reforming which not only reduces greenhouse emission but also produces a H2/CO mixture with a H2/CO ratio adequate for the FischerTropsch process."

[2] "Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the higher d-band center of Ni(100) surface (1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (1.78 eV)."

[3] "Besides the electronic effect, a strong stabilization of adsorbed C atoms was observed on Ni(100), which binds >100 kJ mol1 stronger than a C atom on Ni(111). The more stable tetra-coordinated C on Ni(100) reflects the needs of a C atom to satisfy its valence."

[4] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism: (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

[5] "At least two factors contribute to the relative high barriers of D4 among all four dehydrogenation steps, electronically and geometrically. The electronic effect is influenced by the relative stability of dehydrogenated intermediates."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Electronic properties: The d-band center of metal catalysts affects their dehydrogenation activity. Surfaces with higher d-band centers tend to bind intermediates and transition states more strongly, generally resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers and higher activity.

2. Surface structure: Different crystal facets of the same metal can have varying catalytic properties. For example, Ni(100) shows lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to Ni(111) due to its higher d-band center and stronger binding of carbon intermediates.

3. Coordination environment: The coordination number of active sites impacts the stability of intermediates. For instance, the tetra-coordinated carbon on Ni(100) is more stable than on Ni(111), affecting the overall reaction pathway.

4. Redox properties: For oxide catalysts like vanadium oxide, the ability to undergo reduction and re-oxidation is crucial for the catalytic cycle in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Geometric effects: The spatial arrangement of active sites influences the stability of intermediates and transition states, affecting reaction barriers.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Alloying: Introducing a second metal can alter the electronic structure and binding properties of the catalyst surface.

2. Controlling particle size and shape: This can expose different crystal facets and create specific types of active sites.

3. Tuning the metal-support interaction: This can modify the electronic properties of the active metal.

4. Doping: Introduction of specific elements can alter the redox properties or acidity/basicity of oxide supports.

5. Creating defects or vacancies: This can introduce new active sites with different coordination environments.

6. Surface functionalization: Adding specific functional groups can modify the local environment of active sites.

By carefully tailoring these properties, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 电子性质：金属催化剂的d带中心影响其脱氢活性。d带中心较高的表面倾向于更强地结合中间体和过渡态，通常导致更低的脱氢能垒和更高的活性。

2. 表面结构：同一金属的不同晶面可能具有不同的催化性能。例如，由于Ni(100)具有更高的d带中心和更强的碳中间体结合能力，它比Ni(111)表现出更低的脱氢能垒。

3. 配位环境：活性位点的配位数影响中间体的稳定性。例如，Ni(100)上的四配位碳比Ni(111)上更稳定，影响整个反应路径。

4. 氧化还原性质：对于氧化物催化剂（如钒氧化物），在氧化脱氢反应中，进行还原和再氧化的能力对催化循环至关重要。

5. 几何效应：活性位点的空间排列影响中间体和过渡态的稳定性，从而影响反应能垒。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 合金化：引入第二种金属可以改变催化剂表面的电子结构和结合性质。

2. 控制粒子大小和形状：这可以暴露不同的晶面并创造特定类型的活性位点。

3. 调节金属-载体相互作用：这可以修改活性金属的电子性质。

4. 掺杂：引入特定元素可以改变氧化物载体的氧化还原性质或酸碱性。

5. 创造缺陷或空位：这可以引入具有不同配位环境的新活性位点。

6. 表面功能化：添加特定官能团可以修改活性位点的局部环境。

通过仔细调整这些性质，可以优化催化剂，以提高脱氢反应的效率和选择性。
