[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Ga2O3 is another highly active and selective catalyst for the production of alkenes via alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, such catalysts deactivate quickly, which was suggested to be a consequence of poisoning by carbon deposition formed in light alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "The dehydrogenation of alkanes in zeolites can be promoted by extra-framework metal atoms, such as Zn, In, Ga and Cu, which create new Lewis-acid sites in zeolites."

[5] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework. Joshi and Thomson showed that [GaH]2+ is more stable in a six-membered ring structure than in an eight-membered ring."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Extra-framework metal atoms in zeolites create Lewis-acid sites, promoting alkane dehydrogenation.
- Stability: The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters depends on the zeolite framework structure.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area and porosity: These affect the accessibility of active sites and the diffusion of reactants and products.
- Particle size: Smaller particles generally provide higher surface area and more active sites.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Adding promoters: Late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides can increase robustness against coking.
- Controlling zeolite framework: The ring structure of zeolites influences the stability of active sites.
- Optimizing metal dispersion: This can enhance catalytic efficiency by maximizing the number of active sites.

4. Challenges:
- Coke formation: This remains a major issue, causing catalyst deactivation.
- Balancing activity and selectivity: Highly active catalysts like Ga2O3 may deactivate quickly due to carbon deposition.

To optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity:
- Fine-tune the acid-base properties of the support
- Control the metal particle size and dispersion
- Incorporate appropriate promoters to enhance coking resistance
- Design pore structures that facilitate reactant access and product diffusion
- Develop regeneration strategies to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度：沸石中的骨架外金属原子创造了路易斯酸位点，促进烷烃脱氢。
- 稳定性：金属氧化物或氢化物簇的稳定性取决于沸石骨架结构。

2. 形态特征：
- 表面积和孔隙度：这些影响活性位点的可及性以及反应物和产物的扩散。
- 粒子大小：较小的粒子通常提供更高的表面积和更多的活性位点。

3. 载体改性策略：
- 添加助剂：后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn，Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物可以增加抗结焦能力。
- 控制沸石骨架：沸石的环结构影响活性位点的稳定性。
- 优化金属分散：这可以通过最大化活性位点数量来提高催化效率。

4. 挑战：
- 结焦形成：这仍然是一个主要问题，导致催化剂失活。
- 平衡活性和选择性：像Ga2O3这样的高活性催化剂可能由于碳沉积而快速失活。

为了优化催化效率和选择性：
- 微调载体的酸碱性质
- 控制金属粒子大小和分散度
- 引入适当的助剂以增强抗结焦能力
- 设计有利于反应物进入和产物扩散的孔结构
- 开发再生策略以去除焦炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性
