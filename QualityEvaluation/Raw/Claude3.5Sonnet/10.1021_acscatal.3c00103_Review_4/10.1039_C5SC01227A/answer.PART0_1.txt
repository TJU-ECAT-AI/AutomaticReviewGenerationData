[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have suggested both the single coordinated and the di-coordinated surface O atoms to be the active site of ODH of propane."

[4] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework."

[5] "Calculations suggested that the optimal AlAl distance to be 453 pm corresponding to a minimum overall barrier, and a simple structure-to-activity correlation based on the Sabatier principle was proposed."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength affects the catalytic activity, with stronger Lewis acid sites generally promoting dehydrogenation.
- Stability is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time, particularly in resisting coking.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Surface area and pore structure impact the accessibility of active sites.
- Particle size influences the distribution of active sites and can affect selectivity.
- Crystal structure and exposed facets determine the type and density of active sites.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Adding promoters:
- Late transition metals, main-group metals (e.g., Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides can enhance coking resistance.

2. Controlling surface oxygen coordination:
- Tuning the ratio of single-coordinated to di-coordinated surface oxygen atoms can optimize activity and selectivity in oxide catalysts.

3. Modifying zeolite framework:
- Adjusting the AlAl distance in zeolites can optimize the overall reaction barrier.
- Controlling Si/Al ratio and distribution of Al atoms can influence the stability and activity of metal oxide or hydride clusters.

4. Optimizing particle size and morphology:
- Tailoring particle size and shape can expose desired facets and optimize the balance between activity and selectivity.

5. Surface functionalization:
- Modifying the surface chemistry of supports can enhance metal-support interactions and stability of active species.

By carefully manipulating these physicochemical properties through various support modification strategies, catalysts can be designed with enhanced efficiency, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.
