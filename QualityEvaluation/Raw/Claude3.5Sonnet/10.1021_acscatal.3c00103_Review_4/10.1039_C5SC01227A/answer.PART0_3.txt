[1] "The coordination number of the ad-atom is only 3, which is significantly smaller than CN of the surface atoms on (111) (CN = 9), (211) step edge (CN = 7) and ad-row atoms (CN = 5). It is expected that the strongest binding of a surface intermediate should be observed on an ad-atom due to its smallest coordination number."

[2] "Due to the nature of their 3-D structure, theoretical studies of this system either employ a finite cluster model describing the immediate surroundings of the active site,118 or use a 3-D periodic model to describe the complete structure of the zeolite system."

[3] "The stability of metal oxides or hydride clusters is also influenced by the structure of the zeolite framework. Joshi and Thomson122,123 showed that [GaH]2+ is more stable in a six-membered ring structure than in an eight-membered ring."

[4] "Besides the position of Al atoms, the topology of zeolite framework also affects the dehydrogenation activity. Wannakao et al.124 calculated the methane activation in Au-substituted FAU, FER, ZSM-5 and MCM-22."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Coordination number: Lower coordination numbers of active sites generally lead to stronger binding of surface intermediates, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

2. 3D structure: The complex 3D structure of zeolites affects their catalytic properties, requiring detailed modeling to understand their behavior.

3. Framework structure: The stability of active metal species (e.g., [GaH]2+) depends on the local structure of the zeolite framework, such as ring size.

4. Zeolite topology: Different zeolite frameworks (e.g., FAU, FER, ZSM-5, MCM-22) exhibit varying dehydrogenation activities due to their unique structures.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlling the coordination environment of active sites.
2. Tailoring the zeolite framework structure and composition.
3. Selecting appropriate zeolite topologies for specific reactions.
4. Modifying pore sizes and distributions to enhance mass transfer and selectivity.

These strategies can be employed to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the local environment of active sites and the overall structure of the catalyst support.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学质量和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 配位数：活性位点的较低配位数通常导致表面中间体的更强结合，可能增加催化活性。

2. 3D结构：沸石的复杂3D结构影响其催化性质，需要详细建模来理解其行为。

3. 框架结构：活性金属物种（如[GaH]2+）的稳定性取决于沸石框架的局部结构，如环的大小。

4. 沸石拓扑结构：不同的沸石框架（如FAU、FER、ZSM-5、MCM-22）由于其独特的结构展现不同的脱氢活性。

优化这些性质的支持修饰策略包括：

1. 控制活性位点的配位环境。
2. 调整沸石框架结构和组成。
3. 为特定反应选择适当的沸石拓扑结构。
4. 修改孔径和分布以增强质量传递和选择性。

这些策略可以通过优化活性位点的局部环境和催化剂支持的整体结构，来提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
