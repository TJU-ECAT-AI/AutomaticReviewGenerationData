[1] "Due to the existence of the coverage effect, it is not easy to identify dominating reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions purely based on DFT-calculated barriers."

[2] "The dehydrogenation activity on these three surfaces follows the trend of Pt(211) > Pt(100) > Pt(111), based on the calculated dehydrogenation barriers."

[3] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[5] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical composition: Alloying Pt with metals like Cu and Sn can increase selectivity towards propylene in propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that modifying the chemical makeup of the catalyst can tune its selectivity.

2. Surface structure: Different surface structures of Pt (211, 100, 111) show varying dehydrogenation activities, with Pt(211) being the most active. This indicates that the morphological characteristics of the catalyst surface play a crucial role in determining activity.

3. Stability: Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a major challenge for Pt catalysts, highlighting the importance of catalyst stability.

4. Promoters: The addition of promoters like late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides can improve the catalyst's resistance to coking, thereby enhancing its stability and longevity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Alloying: Incorporating metals like Cu or Sn into Pt catalysts to improve selectivity.

2. Surface structuring: Controlling the surface structure of the catalyst to optimize activity.

3. Promoter addition: Using promoters to enhance coking resistance and stability.

4. Coverage control: Managing surface coverage, as it affects reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by tailoring the catalyst's chemical and morphological properties to suit the specific requirements of the dehydrogenation reaction.
