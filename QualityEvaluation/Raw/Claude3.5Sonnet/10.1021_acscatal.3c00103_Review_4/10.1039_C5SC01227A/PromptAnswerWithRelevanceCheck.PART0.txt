It is expected that the strongest binding of a surface intermediate should be observed on an ad-atom due to its smallest coordination number."

[1] "Although the steam reforming process is now widely used in the modern chemical industry, other alternative routes to process methane are still quite challenging. Such alternative processes include, among others, the direct conversion of methane to other valuable chemicals or the dry CO2 reforming which not only reduces greenhouse emission but also produces a H2/CO mixture with a H2/CO ratio adequate for the FischerTropsch process."

[2] "Interestingly, all four dehydrogenation barriers on Ni(100) are lower than the corresponding ones on Ni(111), which has been connected to the higher d-band center of Ni(100) surface (1.64 eV) than of Ni(111) (1.78 eV)."

[3] "Besides the electronic effect, a strong stabilization of adsorbed C atoms was observed on Ni(100), which binds >100 kJ mol1 stronger than a C atom on Ni(111). The more stable tetra-coordinated C on Ni(100) reflects the needs of a C atom to satisfy its valence."

[4] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism: (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

[5] "At least two factors contribute to the relative high barriers of D4 among all four dehydrogenation steps, electronically and geometrically. The electronic effect is influenced by the relative stability of dehydrogenated intermediates."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Electronic properties: The d-band center of metal catalysts affects their dehydrogenation activity. Surfaces with higher d-band centers tend to bind intermediates and transition states more strongly, generally resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers and higher activity.

2. Surface structure: Different crystal facets of the same metal can have varying catalytic properties. For example, Ni(100) shows lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to Ni(111) due to its higher d-band center and stronger binding of carbon intermediates.

3. Coordination environment: The coordination number of active sites impacts the stability of intermediates. For instance, the tetra-coordinated carbon on Ni(100) is more stable than on Ni(111), affecting the overall reaction pathway.

4. Redox properties: For oxide catalysts like vanadium oxide, the ability to undergo reduction and re-oxidation is crucial for the catalytic cycle in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Geometric effects: The spatial arrangement of active sites influences the stability of intermediates and transition states, affecting reaction barriers.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Alloying: Introducing a second metal can alter the electronic structure and binding properties of the catalyst surface.

2. Controlling particle size and shape: This can expose different crystal facets and create specific types of active sites.

3. Tuning the metal-support interaction: This can modify the electronic properties of the active metal.

4. Doping: Introduction of specific elements can alter the redox properties or acidity/basicity of oxide supports.

5. Creating defects or vacancies: This can introduce new active sites with different coordination environments.

6. Surface functionalization: Adding specific functional groups can modify the local environment of active sites.

By carefully tailoring these properties, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.
