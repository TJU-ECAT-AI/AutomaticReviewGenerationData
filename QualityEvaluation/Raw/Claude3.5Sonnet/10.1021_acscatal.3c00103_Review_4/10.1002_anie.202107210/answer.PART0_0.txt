[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."

[5] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

In propane dehydrogenation (PDH), Pt is widely used due to its high performance in C-H scissions and relatively low performance in C-C cleavage. The geometric effect of the catalyst is important, as PDH is structure-insensitive while side reactions are structure-sensitive. Alloying Pt with inactive metals can help prevent undesired side reactions by diluting large Pt-Pt ensembles.

The electronic properties of Pt also contribute to catalyst performance. Increasing the electron density of Pt induces electrostatic repulsion to propylene, promoting its desorption and improving catalyst stability.

Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties. For example, decorating the surface of intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 with Pb provides geometric modification by blocking Pt3 sites. This modification remains stable at high temperatures due to Pb's large atomic size and the thermal stability of PtGa.

Additionally, depositing alkali or alkaline earth cations (such as Ca2+) around the PtGa nanoparticles serves as an electron-donating agent. These cations, with high ionization tendencies, are not easily reduced or alloyed with PtGa, allowing them to modify the electronic properties of the catalyst without altering its structure.

These strategies synergistically enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing both geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst, resulting in improved performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，由于铂在C-H键断裂方面表现出色，而在C-C键断裂方面表现相对较差，因此被广泛使用。催化剂的几何效应很重要，因为PDH对结构不敏感，而副反应对结构敏感。将铂与惰性金属合金化可以通过稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体来帮助防止不希望的副反应。

铂的电子性质也会影响催化剂的性能。增加铂的电子密度会诱导对丙烯的静电排斥，促进其脱附并提高催化剂的稳定性。

可以采用支持体修饰策略来优化这些性质。例如，用铅装饰SiO2上的金属间化合物PtGa纳米粒子表面，通过阻断Pt3位点提供几何修饰。由于铅的大原子尺寸和PtGa的热稳定性，这种修饰在高温下保持稳定。

此外，在PtGa纳米粒子周围沉积碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+）作为电子给体。这些具有高电离倾向的阳离子不易被还原或与PtGa合金化，允许它们修改催化剂的电子性质而不改变其结构。

这些策略通过优化催化剂的几何和电子性质，协同增强催化效率和选择性，从而提高脱氢反应的性能。
