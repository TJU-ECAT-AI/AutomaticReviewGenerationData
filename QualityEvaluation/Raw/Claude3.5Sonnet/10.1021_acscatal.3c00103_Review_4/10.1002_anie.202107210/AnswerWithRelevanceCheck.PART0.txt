          [1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."

[5] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa."

[6] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."

[7] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Chemical qualities:
   - Acid strength: Not explicitly discussed in the given text.
   - Stability: Crucial for long-term performance. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding stability, maintaining activity for up to a month at 600°C.

2. Morphological characteristics:
   - Geometric effects: Alloying Pt with inactive metals (e.g., Ga) can dilute large Pt-Pt ensembles, preventing undesired side reactions.
   - Surface structure: Specific sites (e.g., Pt1 and Pt3 sites) on the catalyst surface influence reactivity and selectivity.

3. Electronic properties:
   - Electron density of active sites: Increasing the electron density of Pt atoms improves propylene selectivity and catalyst stability by promoting propylene desorption.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Double decoration: Applying both geometric (e.g., Pb) and electronic (e.g., Ca) modifications to PtGa intermetallics.
2. Alloying: Diluting Pt-Pt ensembles with inactive metals like Sn, Ga, In, or Zn.
3. Single-atom isolation: Completely isolating Pt atoms with second metals.
4. Electron donation: Using alkali or alkaline earth cations (e.g., Ca2+) as electron-donating agents.
5. Surface decoration: Selectively blocking certain sites (e.g., Pt3 sites) with elements like Pb.
6. Support interactions: Utilizing interactions between the active metal and the support (e.g., GaOCa linkage).
7. H2 co-feeding: Adding hydrogen to suppress coke formation and improve catalyst stability.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst system.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括：

1. 化学性质：
   - 酸强度：在给定文本中未明确讨论。
   - 稳定性：对长期性能至关重要。PtGaCaPb/SiO2表现出优异的稳定性，在600°C下保持活性长达一个月。

2. 形态特征：
   - 几何效应：将Pt与非活性金属（如Ga）合金化可以稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体，防止不需要的副反应。
   - 表面结构：催化剂表面的特定位点（如Pt1和Pt3位点）影响反应活性和选择性。

3. 电子性质：
   - 活性位点的电子密度：增加Pt原子的电子密度通过促进丙烯脱附来改善丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 双重修饰：对PtGa金属间化合物应用几何（如Pb）和电子（如Ca）双重修饰。
2. 合金化：用Sn、Ga、In或Zn等非活性金属稀释Pt-Pt集合体。
3. 单原子隔离：用第二种金属完全隔离Pt原子。
4. 电子给予：使用碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+）作为电子给予剂。
5. 表面修饰：用Pb等元素选择性地阻挡某些位点（如Pt3位点）。
6. 载体相互作用：利用活性金属与载体之间的相互作用（如GaOCa连接）。
7. H2共进料：添加氢气以抑制积碳形成并提高催化剂稳定性。

这些策略旨在通过优化催化剂系统的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。
