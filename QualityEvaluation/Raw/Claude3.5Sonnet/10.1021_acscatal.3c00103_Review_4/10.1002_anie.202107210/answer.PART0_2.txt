[1] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."

[5] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial for catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Geometrically, alloying Pt with inactive metals like Ga can dilute large Pt-Pt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. This ensemble effect can maximize selectivity by isolating Pt atoms, favoring the desired C-H scissions while inhibiting subsequent reactions that lead to side products.

Electronically, increasing the electron density of Pt can improve catalyst stability. This is because higher electron density induces electrostatic repulsion to propylene, promoting its desorption and reducing the likelihood of side reactions or coking.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Decorating the catalyst surface with specific elements: For example, depositing Pb on PtGa nanoparticles can block undesired Pt3 sites, improving selectivity.

2. Adding electron-donating agents: Depositing alkali or alkaline earth cations (like Ca2+) around the nanoparticles can increase the electron density of Pt, enhancing stability.

3. Using thermally stable supports: SiO2 is used as a support in this study, which helps maintain the structure of the catalyst at high temperatures.

4. Double decoration strategy: Combining geometric (e.g., Pb) and electronic (e.g., Ca) modifiers can synergistically enhance both selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

These strategies aim to create an ideal active site that suppresses side reactions, improves propylene selectivity, and enhances the overall stability and efficiency of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。几何效应和电子效应对催化系统至关重要，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。

从几何角度来看，将Pt与不活泼金属（如Ga）合金化可以稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体，这些集合体已知会激活不需要的副反应。这种集合效应可以通过隔离Pt原子来最大化选择性，有利于所需的C-H断裂，同时抑制导致副产物的后续反应。

从电子角度来看，增加Pt的电子密度可以提高催化剂的稳定性。这是因为更高的电子密度会引起对丙烯的静电排斥，促进其脱附，减少副反应或积碳的可能性。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 用特定元素装饰催化剂表面：例如，在PtGa纳米颗粒上沉积Pb可以阻塞不需要的Pt3位点，提高选择性。

2. 添加电子供体：在纳米颗粒周围沉积碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+）可以增加Pt的电子密度，提高稳定性。

3. 使用热稳定的载体：本研究中使用SiO2作为载体，有助于在高温下维持催化剂的结构。

4. 双重装饰策略：结合几何（如Pb）和电子（如Ca）修饰剂可以协同增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在创造一个理想的活性位点，抑制副反应，提高丙烯选择性，并增强催化剂在PDH反应中的整体稳定性和效率。
