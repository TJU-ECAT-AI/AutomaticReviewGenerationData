[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage."

[2] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "PtGaCa, which possesses electron-enriched Pt atoms, exhibited higher C3H6 selectivity and stability compared with those of PtGa. Thus, tuning the electronic property of the intermetallics was effective in prolonging the lifetime of the catalyst."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: Not explicitly discussed in the given text.
- Stability: The stability of catalysts is crucial for their long-term performance. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited outstanding stability, maintaining activity for up to a month at 600°C.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Particle size and distribution: The catalysts discussed had nanoparticles with mean particle sizes around 2.2-2.4 nm, uniformly distributed on the support.
- Surface structure: The presence of specific sites (e.g., Pt1 and Pt3 sites) on the catalyst surface influences reactivity and selectivity.

3. Electronic properties:
- Electron density of active sites: Increasing the electron density of Pt atoms improved propylene selectivity and catalyst stability by promoting propylene desorption.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Double decoration: Applying both geometric and electronic modifications, such as decorating PtGa intermetallics with Pb (geometric effect) and Ca (electronic effect).

2. Alloying: Diluting large PtPt ensembles by alloying Pt with inactive metals like Sn, Ga, In, or Zn to prevent side reactions.

3. Single-atom isolation: Completely isolating Pt atoms with second metals to favor specific CH scissions while inhibiting others.

4. Electron donation: Using alkali or alkaline earth cations (e.g., Ca2+) as electron-donating agents to modify the electronic properties of active sites.

5. Surface decoration: Selectively blocking certain sites (e.g., Pt3 sites) with elements like Pb to enhance selectivity.

6. Support interactions: Utilizing interactions between the active metal and the support (e.g., GaOCa linkage) to stabilize the catalyst structure.

7. H2 co-feeding: Adding hydrogen to the reaction mixture to suppress coke formation and improve catalyst stability.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst system.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度：在给定文本中未明确讨论。
- 稳定性：催化剂的稳定性对其长期性能至关重要。PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂表现出优异的稳定性，在600°C下保持活性长达一个月。

2. 形态特征：
- 粒径和分布：讨论的催化剂具有平均粒径约2.2-2.4 nm的纳米颗粒，均匀分布在载体上。
- 表面结构：催化剂表面特定位点（如Pt1和Pt3位点）的存在影响反应活性和选择性。

3. 电子性质：
- 活性位点的电子密度：增加Pt原子的电子密度通过促进丙烯脱附来改善丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 双重修饰：应用几何和电子双重修饰，如用Pb（几何效应）和Ca（电子效应）修饰PtGa金属间化合物。

2. 合金化：通过将Pt与Sn、Ga、In或Zn等惰性金属合金化来稀释大的PtPt集合体，防止副反应。

3. 单原子隔离：用第二种金属完全隔离Pt原子，以促进特定的CH断裂同时抑制其他断裂。

4. 电子给予：使用碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+）作为电子给予剂来修饰活性位点的电子性质。

5. 表面修饰：用Pb等元素选择性地阻挡某些位点（如Pt3位点）以增强选择性。

6. 载体相互作用：利用活性金属与载体之间的相互作用（如GaOCa连接）来稳定催化剂结构。

7. H2共进料：向反应混合物中添加氢气以抑制积碳形成并提高催化剂稳定性。

这些策略旨在通过优化催化剂系统的活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。
