[1] "Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in CH scissions and relatively low performance in CC cleavage."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa."

[5] "Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+, is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

In propane dehydrogenation (PDH), Pt is widely used due to its high performance in C-H scissions and relatively low performance in C-C cleavage. The geometric effect of the catalyst is important, as PDH is structure-insensitive while side reactions are structure-sensitive. Alloying Pt with inactive metals can help prevent undesired side reactions by diluting large Pt-Pt ensembles.

The electronic properties of Pt also contribute to catalyst performance. Increasing the electron density of Pt induces electrostatic repulsion to propylene, promoting its desorption and improving catalyst stability.

Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties. For example, decorating the surface of intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 with Pb provides geometric modification by blocking Pt3 sites. This modification remains stable at high temperatures due to Pb's large atomic size and the thermal stability of PtGa.

Additionally, depositing alkali or alkaline earth cations (such as Ca2+) around the PtGa nanoparticles serves as an electron-donating agent. These cations, with high ionization tendencies, are not easily reduced or alloyed with PtGa, allowing them to modify the electronic properties of the catalyst without altering its structure.

These strategies synergistically enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing both geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst, resulting in improved performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，由于铂在C-H键断裂方面表现出色，而在C-C键断裂方面表现相对较差，因此被广泛使用。催化剂的几何效应很重要，因为PDH对结构不敏感，而副反应对结构敏感。将铂与惰性金属合金化可以通过稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体来帮助防止不希望的副反应。

铂的电子性质也会影响催化剂的性能。增加铂的电子密度会诱导对丙烯的静电排斥，促进其脱附并提高催化剂的稳定性。

可以采用支持体修饰策略来优化这些性质。例如，用铅装饰SiO2上的金属间化合物PtGa纳米粒子表面，通过阻断Pt3位点提供几何修饰。由于铅的大原子尺寸和PtGa的热稳定性，这种修饰在高温下保持稳定。

此外，在PtGa纳米粒子周围沉积碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+）作为电子给体。这些具有高电离倾向的阳离子不易被还原或与PtGa合金化，允许它们修改催化剂的电子性质而不改变其结构。

这些策略通过优化催化剂的几何和电子性质，协同增强催化效率和选择性，从而提高脱氢反应的性能。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The geometric and electronic effects are crucial for catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Geometrically, alloying Pt with inactive metals like Ga can dilute large Pt-Pt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. This ensemble effect can maximize selectivity by isolating Pt atoms, favoring the desired C-H scissions while inhibiting subsequent reactions that lead to side products.

Electronically, increasing the electron density of Pt can improve catalyst stability. This is because higher electron density induces electrostatic repulsion to propylene, promoting its desorption and reducing the likelihood of side reactions or coking.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Decorating the catalyst surface with specific elements: For example, depositing Pb on PtGa nanoparticles can block undesired Pt3 sites, improving selectivity.

2. Adding electron-donating agents: Depositing alkali or alkaline earth cations (like Ca2+) around the nanoparticles can increase the electron density of Pt, enhancing stability.

3. Using thermally stable supports: SiO2 is used as a support in this study, which helps maintain the structure of the catalyst at high temperatures.

4. Double decoration strategy: Combining geometric (e.g., Pb) and electronic (e.g., Ca) modifiers can synergistically enhance both selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

These strategies aim to create an ideal active site that suppresses side reactions, improves propylene selectivity, and enhances the overall stability and efficiency of the catalyst in PDH reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。几何效应和电子效应对催化系统至关重要，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应。

从几何角度来看，将Pt与不活泼金属（如Ga）合金化可以稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体，这些集合体已知会激活不需要的副反应。这种集合效应可以通过隔离Pt原子来最大化选择性，有利于所需的C-H断裂，同时抑制导致副产物的后续反应。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 用特定元素装饰催化剂表面：例如，在PtGa纳米颗粒上沉积Pb可以阻塞不需要的Pt3位点，提高选择性。

2. 添加电子供体：在纳米颗粒周围沉积碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+）可以增加Pt的电子密度，提高稳定性。

3. 使用热稳定的载体：本研究中使用SiO2作为载体，有助于在高温下维持催化剂的结构。

4. 双重装饰策略：结合几何（如Pb）和电子（如Ca）修饰剂可以协同增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在创造一个理想的活性位点，抑制副反应，提高丙烯选择性，并增强催化剂在PDH反应中的整体稳定性和效率。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Morphological characteristics, particularly the geometric arrangement of active sites, are also important.

The study highlights two main aspects of catalyst design for propane dehydrogenation (PDH):

1. Geometric effects: Alloying Pt with inactive metals like Ga helps dilute large Pt-Pt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. The geometric arrangement of active sites can be further optimized by decorating the catalyst surface with elements like Pb to block specific sites (e.g., Pt3 sites).

2. Electronic effects: Modifying the electron density of Pt atoms can influence the adsorption strength of reactants and products. Increasing the electron density of Pt can promote propylene desorption, thereby improving catalyst stability.

Support modification strategies employed to optimize these properties include:

1. Using SiO2 as a support for PtGa nanoparticles, providing a stable base for the active catalyst.

2. Decorating the catalyst surface with Pb to achieve geometric modification, blocking undesired active sites.

3. Depositing alkali or alkaline earth cations (e.g., Ca2+) around the PtGa nanoparticles to act as electron-donating agents, modifying the electronic properties of Pt.

These strategies work synergistically to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing both the geometric arrangement of active sites and the electronic properties of the catalyst. The resulting doubly decorated intermetallic catalyst (PtGaCaPb/SiO2) demonstrated superior stability and performance in PDH reactions compared to previous catalysts.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学特性如酸强度和稳定性在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。形态特征，特别是活性位点的几何排列，也很重要。

该研究强调了丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂设计的两个主要方面：

1. 几何效应：将Pt与Ga等非活性金属合金化有助于稀释大的Pt-Pt集合体，这些集合体已知会激活不需要的副反应。通过用Pb等元素装饰催化剂表面以阻挡特定位点（如Pt3位点），可以进一步优化活性位点的几何排列。

用于优化这些性质的支持体修饰策略包括：

1. 使用SiO2作为PtGa纳米颗粒的支持体，为活性催化剂提供稳定的基础。

2. 用Pb装饰催化剂表面以实现几何修饰，阻挡不需要的活性位点。

3. 在PtGa纳米颗粒周围沉积碱金属或碱土金属阳离子（如Ca2+），作为电子供体，修改Pt的电子性质。
