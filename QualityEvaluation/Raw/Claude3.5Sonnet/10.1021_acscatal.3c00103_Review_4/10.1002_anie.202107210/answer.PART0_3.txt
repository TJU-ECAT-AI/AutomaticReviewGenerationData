[1] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."

[2] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1month."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Geometric effects: Alloying Pt with inactive metals like Sn, Ga, In, or Zn can dilute large PtPt ensembles, which are known to activate undesired side reactions. This ensemble effect can maximize selectivity for desired reactions.

2. Electronic effects: Increasing the electron density of Pt can promote propylene desorption and improve catalyst stability by inducing electrostatic repulsion between Pt and propylene.

3. Thermal stability: Catalysts that maintain their structure at high temperatures (>600°C) are crucial for continuous operation without frequent regeneration.

4. Resistance to coking: The ability to minimize coke formation is essential for maintaining catalyst activity over time.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Double decoration: As demonstrated with PtGaCaPb/SiO2, combining geometric modification (Pb deposition) with electronic modification (Ca addition) can synergistically enhance catalyst stability and selectivity.

2. Intermetallic compound formation: Creating thermally stable intermetallic compounds (e.g., PtGa) can provide isolated active sites that resist sintering at high temperatures.

3. Co-feeding H2: This strategy can significantly reduce coke formation, thereby improving catalytic stability.

4. Use of appropriate support materials: Selecting suitable supports (e.g., SiO2) can help maintain catalyst dispersion and stability.

These strategies aim to create catalysts with optimal geometric and electronic properties, high thermal stability, and resistance to coking, resulting in enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括：

1. 几何效应：将Pt与Sn、Ga、In或Zn等惰性金属合金化可以稀释大的PtPt集合体，这些集合体已知会激活不需要的副反应。这种集合效应可以最大化所需反应的选择性。

2. 电子效应：增加Pt的电子密度可以通过诱导Pt和丙烯之间的静电排斥来促进丙烯的脱附，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。

3. 热稳定性：在高温下（>600°C）保持结构的催化剂对于持续运行而无需频繁再生至关重要。

4. 抗结焦性：最小化结焦形成的能力对于长期保持催化剂活性至关重要。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 双重修饰：如PtGaCaPb/SiO2所示，将几何修饰（Pb沉积）与电子修饰（Ca添加）相结合可以协同增强催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

2. 金属间化合物形成：创建热稳定的金属间化合物（如PtGa）可以提供在高温下抗烧结的孤立活性位点。

3. 共进料H2：这种策略可以显著减少结焦形成，从而提高催化稳定性。

4. 使用适当的载体材料：选择合适的载体（如SiO2）可以帮助保持催化剂的分散性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在创建具有最佳几何和电子性质、高热稳定性和抗结焦性的催化剂，从而在脱氢反应中提高催化效率和选择性。
