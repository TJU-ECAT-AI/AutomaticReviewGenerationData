[1] "The PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts were fully characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, STEM, XPS, and CO-IR techniques, which reveals that highly dispersed PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles are enclosed into mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5."

[2] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[3] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[4] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

[5] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The key properties include:

1. Particle dispersion: Highly dispersed PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles enclosed in mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 contribute to improved catalytic performance.

2. Pore structure: The presence of mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 plays a crucial role. It confines and stabilizes PtSn particles, enhancing their stability at high temperatures. Additionally, mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing easier access of propane to active sites and faster removal of propylene products.

3. Metal composition: The Sn/Pt ratio in bimetallic particles greatly affects catalytic performance.

4. Support modification: Desilication of ZSM-5 using alkali solutions creates hierarchical structures with mesopores, which is a key support modification strategy. The concentration of the alkali solution used in this process significantly impacts the catalyst's performance.

These properties collectively contribute to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by:
- Stabilizing active metal particles
- Improving reactant and product diffusion
- Reducing unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking
- Optimizing the electronic state of active metal sites

To optimize these properties, strategies include:
- Controlled desilication to create mesopores without destroying the zeolite structure
- Fine-tuning of Sn/Pt ratios in bimetallic particles
- Optimizing the alkali treatment conditions to achieve the desired hierarchical structure

These modifications aim to balance the confinement effect, diffusion improvement, and stability of active sites to achieve optimal catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.
