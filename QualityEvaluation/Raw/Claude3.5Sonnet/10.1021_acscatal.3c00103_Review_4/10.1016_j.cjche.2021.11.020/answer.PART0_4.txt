[1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

[4] "The desilication of ZSM-5 with NaOH solution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol·L1 leads to a decrease of crystallinity, but the topology of MFI is still well kept."

[5] "The stability of the Pt particles at the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by the manipulation of metal-support interaction"

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

For the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, the concentrations of alkali solution used in the desilication process and the Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles are key factors affecting catalytic performance. The creation of mesopores in the ZSM-5 zeolite structure through desilication is a critical support modification strategy. These mesopores confine PtSn particles, which enhances catalyst stability at high temperatures.

The hierarchical structure with both micropores and mesopores improves diffusion rates, allowing easier access of propane to PtSn particles and faster diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal. This enhanced mass transfer leads to higher propane conversion and reduced side reactions like cracking and coking.

Optimizing the desilication process is crucial, as it affects the crystallinity and porosity of the zeolite. The treatment with NaOH solution creates mesopores while maintaining the overall MFI topology, striking a balance between increased accessibility and preserved zeolite structure.

Another important aspect is the metal-support interaction. Manipulating this interaction can greatly enhance the stability of Pt particles on the support surface, which is critical for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

In summary, key strategies for optimizing catalyst properties include careful control of the desilication process to create an optimal hierarchical structure, fine-tuning of the Sn/Pt ratio in bimetallic particles, and enhancing metal-support interactions. These modifications aim to balance acid strength, stability, porosity, and metal dispersion to achieve high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

对于PtSn/层次结构ZSM-5催化剂，脱硅过程中使用的碱溶液浓度和PtSn双金属颗粒中的Sn/Pt比例是影响催化性能的关键因素。通过脱硅在ZSM-5沸石结构中创建介孔是一个关键的载体改性策略。这些介孔限制了PtSn颗粒，提高了催化剂在高温下的稳定性。

具有微孔和介孔的层次结构提高了扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触到PtSn颗粒，丙烯也能更快地从沸石晶体中扩散出来。这种增强的传质效应导致了更高的丙烷转化率和减少的副反应，如裂解和结焦。

优化脱硅过程至关重要，因为它影响沸石的结晶度和孔隙度。NaOH溶液处理创建了介孔，同时保持了整体MFI拓扑结构，在增加可及性和保持沸石结构之间取得平衡。

另一个重要方面是金属-载体相互作用。操控这种相互作用可以大大提高Pt颗粒在载体表面的稳定性，这对于长期维持催化剂性能至关重要。

总之，优化催化剂性质的关键策略包括仔细控制脱硅过程以创建最佳层次结构，精细调节双金属颗粒中的Sn/Pt比例，以及增强金属-载体相互作用。这些修改旨在平衡酸强度、稳定性、孔隙度和金属分散度，以在脱氢反应中实现高催化效率和选择性。
