[1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

[4] "The desilication of ZSM-5 with NaOH solution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol·L1 leads to a decrease of crystallinity, but the topology of MFI is still well kept."

[5] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics play crucial roles in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

In the case of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, the key factors affecting performance include:

1. Mesopore structure: The presence of mesopores in the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite enhances catalytic performance by confining PtSn particles and improving diffusion rates. This confinement effect stabilizes the PtSn particles at high temperatures and allows easier access for propane molecules to reach active sites.

2. Alkali treatment concentration: The desilication process using NaOH solution creates the hierarchical structure. The concentration of the alkali solution affects the crystallinity and porosity of the zeolite, which in turn impacts catalytic performance.

3. Sn/Pt ratio: The ratio of Sn to Pt in the bimetallic particles significantly influences the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

4. Particle size and dispersion: The size and distribution of PtSn particles within the zeolite structure affect the catalyst's performance.

5. Zeolite framework stability: While desilication decreases crystallinity, maintaining the overall MFI topology is crucial for preserving the zeolite's beneficial properties.

To optimize these properties, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlled desilication: Carefully adjusting the concentration of the alkali solution and treatment time to create an optimal hierarchical structure without excessive damage to the zeolite framework.

2. Tuning metal loading: Optimizing the Sn/Pt ratio and overall metal content to achieve the best balance between activity and selectivity.

3. Post-synthesis treatments: Employing techniques such as ion exchange or selective removal of framework atoms to modify acidity or create additional porosity.

4. Templating methods: Using structure-directing agents during zeolite synthesis to create desired pore structures.

5. Composite materials: Combining the zeolite with other support materials to enhance stability or introduce additional functionalities.

By carefully controlling these factors and employing appropriate modification strategies, it is possible to tailor the physicochemical properties of the catalyst to achieve enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。

对于PtSn/分级ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中，影响性能的关键因素包括：

1. 介孔结构：分级ZSM-5沸石中介孔的存在通过限制PtSn颗粒和改善扩散速率来增强催化性能。这种限制效应在高温下稳定PtSn颗粒，并允许丙烷分子更容易接触活性位点。

2. 碱处理浓度：使用NaOH溶液的脱硅过程创造了分级结构。碱溶液的浓度影响沸石的结晶度和孔隙度，进而影响催化性能。

3. Sn/Pt比例：双金属颗粒中Sn与Pt的比例显著影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

4. 粒子尺寸和分散度：PtSn颗粒在沸石结构中的尺寸和分布影响催化剂的性能。

5. 沸石骨架稳定性：虽然脱硅会降低结晶度，但保持整体MFI拓扑结构对于保持沸石的有益性质至关重要。

为优化这些性质，可以采用几种载体改性策略：

1. 受控脱硅：仔细调整碱溶液浓度和处理时间，以创建最佳分级结构，同时不过度损害沸石骨架。

2. 调整金属负载：优化Sn/Pt比例和整体金属含量，以达到活性和选择性之间的最佳平衡。

3. 后合成处理：采用离子交换或选择性去除骨架原子等技术来修改酸度或创造额外的孔隙度。

4. 模板法：在沸石合成过程中使用结构导向剂来创建所需的孔结构。

5. 复合材料：将沸石与其他载体材料结合，以增强稳定性或引入额外功能。

通过仔细控制这些因素并采用适当的改性策略，可以定制催化剂的物理化学性质，以在脱氢反应中实现更高的效率和选择性。
