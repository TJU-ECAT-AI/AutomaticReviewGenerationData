[1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The key factors include:

1. Mesoporous structure: The presence of mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Mesopores confine and stabilize PtSn particles, preventing sintering at high temperatures.

2. Diffusion properties: Mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing propane to easily access PtSn particles and facilitating the rapid removal of propylene. This enhances propane conversion and reduces unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking.

3. Metal composition and distribution: The ratio of Sn to Pt in bimetallic particles significantly affects catalyst performance. Optimizing this ratio can lead to improved conversion and selectivity.

4. Support modification strategies: Desilication of ZSM-5 zeolite using alkali solutions creates a hierarchical structure with both micropores and mesopores. The concentration of the alkali solution used in this process greatly influences the final catalyst performance.

5. Particle size and dispersion: Highly dispersed, small PtSn particles (around 1.33 nm in this study) contribute to improved catalytic performance.

By carefully controlling these properties through synthesis methods and support modifications, catalysts can be optimized for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。关键因素包括：

1. 介孔结构：分级ZSM-5沸石中介孔的存在对提高催化效率和选择性起着至关重要的作用。介孔可以限制和稳定PtSn粒子，防止其在高温下烧结。

2. 扩散性能：介孔加速扩散速率，使丙烷容易接触到PtSn粒子，并促进丙烯的快速移除。这提高了丙烷转化率，并减少了不需要的副反应，如裂解和积碳。

3. 金属组成和分布：双金属粒子中Sn与Pt的比例显著影响催化剂性能。优化这一比例可以提高转化率和选择性。

4. 载体改性策略：使用碱溶液对ZSM-5沸石进行脱硅处理，创造出同时具有微孔和介孔的分级结构。这一过程中使用的碱溶液浓度极大地影响最终催化剂的性能。

5. 粒子大小和分散度：高度分散的小PtSn粒子（本研究中约为1.33 nm）有助于提高催化性能。

通过合成方法和载体改性来仔细控制这些性质，可以优化催化剂，以提高脱氢反应的效率和选择性。
