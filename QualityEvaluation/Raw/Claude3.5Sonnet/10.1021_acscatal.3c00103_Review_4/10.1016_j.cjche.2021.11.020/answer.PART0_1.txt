[1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

[4] "The desilication of ZSM-5 with NaOH solution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol·L1 leads to a decrease of crystallinity, but the topology of MFI is still well kept."

[5] "The treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite with NaOH solution at a low concentration of 0.2 mol·L-1 leads to an increase of surface area to 294 m2·g1 and total pore volume to 0.17 cm3·g1."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The key factors include:

1. Mesopore structure: The presence of mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite confines PtSn particles, stabilizing them at high temperatures. This confinement effect enhances catalyst stability and performance.

2. Surface area and pore volume: Alkali treatment increases the surface area and pore volume of the zeolite, providing more accessible active sites for the reaction.

3. Crystallinity: While desilication decreases crystallinity, maintaining the overall MFI topology is crucial for preserving the zeolite's catalytic properties.

4. Diffusion properties: Mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing easier access of propane to active sites and faster removal of propylene, reducing side reactions and coking.

5. Metal dispersion and alloying: The ratio of Sn to Pt in bimetallic particles affects catalyst performance, with an optimal ratio around 1:1.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlled desilication: Using appropriate concentrations of alkali solution (e.g., NaOH) to create mesopores without destroying the zeolite structure.

2. Optimizing metal loading: Carefully controlling the Sn/Pt ratio to achieve the best catalytic performance.

3. Post-synthesis treatments: Tailoring the acid strength and stability through ion-exchange or other treatments.

4. Hierarchical structure design: Creating a balance between micropores and mesopores to optimize diffusion and reaction kinetics.

5. Bimetallic particle engineering: Developing methods to ensure uniform dispersion and alloying of Pt and Sn within the zeolite structure.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the balance between active site accessibility, stability, and diffusion properties of the catalyst.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括：

1. 介孔结构：分级ZSM-5沸石中的介孔结构可以限制PtSn颗粒，在高温下稳定它们。这种限制效应增强了催化剂的稳定性和性能。

2. 比表面积和孔体积：碱处理增加了沸石的比表面积和孔体积，为反应提供了更多可接触的活性位点。

3. 结晶度：虽然脱硅会降低结晶度，但保持整体MFI拓扑结构对于保持沸石的催化性能至关重要。

4. 扩散性质：介孔加速扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触活性位点，丙烯更快地移出，减少副反应和积碳。

5. 金属分散和合金化：双金属颗粒中Sn与Pt的比例影响催化剂性能，最佳比例约为1:1。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 受控脱硅：使用适当浓度的碱溶液（如NaOH）创建介孔，而不破坏沸石结构。

2. 优化金属负载：仔细控制Sn/Pt比例以实现最佳催化性能。

3. 后合成处理：通过离子交换或其他处理调整酸强度和稳定性。

4. 分级结构设计：在微孔和介孔之间创造平衡，以优化扩散和反应动力学。

5. 双金属颗粒工程：开发方法确保Pt和Sn在沸石结构中均匀分散和合金化。

这些策略旨在通过优化活性位点可及性、稳定性和催化剂的扩散性能之间的平衡来提高催化效率和选择性。
