          [1] "The catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 is greatly affected by the concentrations of alkali solution in the desilication process and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles."

[2] "The high efficiency in these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly ascribed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

[3] "The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation. Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

[5] "The desilication of ZSM-5 with NaOH solution from 0.2 to 1.0 mol·L1 leads to a decrease of crystallinity, but the topology of MFI is still well kept."

[6] "The stability of the Pt particles at the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by the manipulation of metal-support interaction"

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Mesoporous structure: Mesopores in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite confine and stabilize PtSn particles, enhancing catalyst stability at high temperatures.

2. Diffusion properties: Mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, improving reactant access and product removal, which enhances conversion and reduces side reactions.

3. Metal composition and distribution: The Sn/Pt ratio in bimetallic particles greatly affects catalyst performance.

4. Support modification: Desilication using alkali solutions creates a hierarchical structure with both micropores and mesopores. The concentration of the alkali solution significantly impacts the final catalyst performance.

5. Crystallinity and topology: While desilication decreases crystallinity, maintaining the overall MFI topology is crucial for preserving zeolite properties.

6. Metal-support interaction: Enhancing this interaction improves the stability of Pt particles on the support surface.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlled desilication: Carefully adjusting alkali concentration and treatment time to create optimal hierarchical structures.

2. Metal loading optimization: Fine-tuning the Sn/Pt ratio and overall metal content.

3. Post-synthesis treatments: Using techniques like ion exchange or selective atom removal to modify acidity or create additional porosity.

4. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Developing methods to strengthen the bond between metal particles and the support.

These strategies aim to balance acid strength, stability, porosity, and metal dispersion to achieve high catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括：

1. 介孔结构：分级ZSM-5沸石中的介孔限制和稳定PtSn颗粒，提高了催化剂在高温下的稳定性。

2. 扩散性能：介孔加速扩散速率，改善反应物接触和产物移除，从而提高转化率并减少副反应。

3. 金属组成和分布：双金属颗粒中的Sn/Pt比例极大地影响催化剂性能。

4. 载体改性：使用碱溶液进行脱硅处理，创造出同时具有微孔和介孔的分级结构。碱溶液的浓度显著影响最终催化剂的性能。

5. 结晶度和拓扑结构：虽然脱硅会降低结晶度，但保持整体MFI拓扑结构对于保持沸石性质至关重要。

6. 金属-载体相互作用：增强这种相互作用可以提高Pt颗粒在载体表面的稳定性。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 受控脱硅：仔细调整碱浓度和处理时间，以创建最佳分级结构。

2. 金属负载优化：精细调节Sn/Pt比例和总体金属含量。

3. 后合成处理：使用离子交换或选择性原子去除等技术来修改酸度或创造额外的孔隙度。

4. 增强金属-载体相互作用：开发方法来加强金属颗粒与载体之间的结合。

这些策略旨在平衡酸强度、稳定性、孔隙度和金属分散度，以在脱氢反应中实现高催化效率和选择性。
