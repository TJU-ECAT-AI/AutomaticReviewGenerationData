          [1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with an acceptable deactivation rate of ∼ 0.02 h−1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h−1 is achieved in the presence of H2."

          The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
   - Acid strength: Lewis acidity, resulting from electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, enhances catalytic performance.
   - Stability: Stabilization of Zn species by silanols from zeolite framework dealumination contributes to catalyst stability.

2. Morphological characteristics:
   - Dispersion: Homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the support is crucial for catalytic efficiency.
   - Particle size: Highly-dispersed Zn species act as anchoring sites for Pt, forming small, well-distributed active sites.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Dealumination: Creates silanol groups that act as anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species.
2. Bimetallic system: Zn modifies Pt's electronic properties, weakening propylene adsorption and improving selectivity.
3. Controlled metal loading: Optimizing Pt-Zn ratio ensures close contact and electronic interaction between metals.
4. Hydrogen addition: Improves catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation.

These strategies enhance metal dispersion, modify electronic properties, and create stable active sites, resulting in improved catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions. For example, the 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst achieves high propylene production rates with low deactivation rates, especially in the presence of H2.

          催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
   - 酸强度：由Zn向Pt物种的电子转移产生的Lewis酸性增强了催化性能。
   - 稳定性：沸石骨架脱铝产生的硅醇基对Zn物种的稳定作用有助于催化剂的稳定性。

2. 形态特征：
   - 分散性：Pt-Zn物种在载体上的均匀分散对催化效率至关重要。
   - 粒径：高分散的Zn物种作为Pt的锚定位点，形成小而分布均匀的活性位点。

优化这些性质的载体改性策略包括：

1. 脱铝：产生作为Zn和Pt-Zn物种锚定位点的硅醇基。
2. 双金属体系：Zn改变Pt的电子性质，减弱丙烯吸附并提高选择性。
3. 控制金属负载：优化Pt-Zn比例确保金属之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用。
4. 氢气添加：通过抑制积碳形成提高催化剂稳定性。

这些策略增强金属分散性、改变电子性质并创造稳定的活性位点，从而提高脱氢反应中的催化效率、选择性和稳定性。例如，0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta催化剂实现了高丙烯产率和低失活率，尤其是在有H2存在的情况下。
