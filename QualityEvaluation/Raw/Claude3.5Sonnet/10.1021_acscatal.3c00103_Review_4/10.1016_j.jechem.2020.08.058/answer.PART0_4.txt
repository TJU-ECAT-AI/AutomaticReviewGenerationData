[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "The good catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in the reaction is well explained, and the deactivation mechanism is finally discussed."

[3] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "These results show that the modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities:
- Acid strength: The Lewis acidity observed in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts, resulting from electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, indicates strong interaction between Pt and Zn on the Si-Beta support. This interaction enhances catalytic performance.
- Stability: The stabilization of highly-dispersed Zn species by silanols from zeolite framework dealumination contributes to the catalyst's stability and performance.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Dispersion: Homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the support is crucial for catalytic efficiency. This is achieved through the anchoring of Zn and Pt-Zn species to framework vacant sites (silanol groups) created by dealumination.
- Particle size: Highly-dispersed Zn species and their role as anchoring sites for Pt species contribute to the formation of small, well-distributed active sites.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Dealumination: This process creates silanol groups that act as anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.
- Bimetallic system: The introduction of Zn modifies the electronic properties of Pt through electron transfer, enriching Pt's electron density and weakening propylene adsorption. This helps suppress unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity.
- Controlled metal loading: Optimizing the Pt-Zn ratio ensures close contact and electronic interaction between the two metals, which is essential for catalyst performance.

These strategies optimize the catalyst's properties by enhancing metal dispersion, modifying electronic properties, and creating stable active sites. This results in improved catalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度：在Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂中观察到的Lewis酸性，源于Zn向Pt物种的电子转移，表明Pt和Zn在Si-Beta支撑体上有强烈的相互作用。这种相互作用增强了催化性能。
- 稳定性：沸石骨架脱铝产生的硅醇基对高分散Zn物种的稳定作用，有助于催化剂的稳定性和性能。

2. 形态特征：
- 分散性：Pt-Zn物种在载体上的均匀分散对催化效率至关重要。这是通过将Zn和Pt-Zn物种锚定到脱铝产生的骨架空位（硅醇基）上实现的。
- 粒径：高分散的Zn物种及其作为Pt物种锚定位点的作用，有助于形成小而分布均匀的活性位点。

3. 载体改性策略：
- 脱铝：这个过程产生硅醇基，作为Zn和Pt-Zn物种的锚定位点，确保它们的均匀分散。
- 双金属体系：引入Zn通过电子转移改变Pt的电子性质，富集Pt的电子密度并减弱丙烯的吸附。这有助于抑制不需要的副反应并提高选择性。
- 控制金属负载：优化Pt-Zn比例确保两种金属之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用，这对催化剂性能至关重要。

这些策略通过增强金属分散性、改变电子性质和创造稳定的活性位点来优化催化剂的性能。这导致脱氢反应中催化效率、选择性和稳定性的提高。
