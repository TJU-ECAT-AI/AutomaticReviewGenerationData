[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

[3] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof."

[5] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Dispersion of active species: Highly-dispersed Zn and Pt species on the support enhance catalytic activity. This is achieved through the stabilization of Zn by silanol groups from zeolite framework dealumination, which then anchor Pt species.

2. Electronic interactions: The close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species contribute to the robustness of the catalyst. Electron transfer from Zn to Pt modifies the electronic properties of both species, affecting their catalytic behavior.

3. Acidity: The electron transfer from Zn to Pt creates Lewis acid sites, which can influence the catalytic process.

4. Adsorption properties: The electronic modification of Pt by Zn weakens the adsorption of propylene, which can help prevent unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

5. Morphology: The framework vacant sites created by dealumination act as anchoring points for active species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.

To optimize these properties, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlled dealumination: This creates silanol groups and framework vacancies that act as anchoring sites for active species.

2. Sequential metal loading: Adding Zn first, followed by Pt, helps maintain high dispersion and promotes Pt-Zn interaction.

3. Optimizing metal ratios: Balancing the Pt/Zn ratio is crucial for achieving the desired electronic interactions and catalytic performance.

4. Zeolite selection: Using a zeolite support like Si-Beta provides a high surface area and suitable framework for anchoring active species.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the dispersion, electronic properties, and stability of the active species on the support.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括：

1. 活性物种的分散：高度分散的Zn和Pt物种可以提高催化活性。这是通过沸石骨架脱铝形成的硅醇基团稳定Zn，进而锚定Pt物种来实现的。

2. 电子相互作用：Pt和Zn物种之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用有助于催化剂的稳定性。Zn向Pt的电子转移改变了两种物种的电子性质，影响其催化行为。

3. 酸性：Zn向Pt的电子转移创造了路易斯酸位点，这可能影响催化过程。

4. 吸附性质：Zn对Pt的电子修饰减弱了丙烯的吸附，这有助于防止不需要的副反应和积碳形成。

5. 形态：脱铝产生的骨架空位作为活性物种的锚定点，确保了它们的均匀分散。

为优化这些性质，可以采用以下几种载体修饰策略：

1. 受控脱铝：这会产生硅醇基团和骨架空位，作为活性物种的锚定位点。

2. 顺序金属负载：先添加Zn，然后添加Pt，有助于保持高分散度并促进Pt-Zn相互作用。

3. 优化金属比例：平衡Pt/Zn比例对于实现所需的电子相互作用和催化性能至关重要。

4. 沸石选择：使用Si-Beta等沸石载体提供了高比表面积和适合锚定活性物种的骨架。

这些策略旨在通过优化载体上活性物种的分散、电子性质和稳定性来提高催化效率和选择性。
