[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support."

[3] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The study reveals that the Lewis acidity observed in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts is indicative of strong interactions between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support, which is beneficial for the catalytic process.

Morphological characteristics, particularly the dispersion of active metal species, are essential for optimal catalyst performance. The research shows that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then serve as anchoring sites for Pt species. This ensures a homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the support, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency.

Support modification strategies employed to optimize these properties include:

1. Framework dealumination: This creates vacant sites (silanols) that act as anchoring points for Zn and Pt-Zn species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.

2. Sequential metal loading: The study demonstrates that loading Zn first, followed by Pt, results in better catalytic performance compared to the reverse order. This strategy helps suppress Pt agglomeration and promotes Pt-Zn interaction.

3. Optimizing metal loadings: The research shows that finding the optimal Pt/Zn ratio is crucial for achieving the best catalytic performance. This involves balancing the close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species.

4. Electron transfer modulation: The transfer of electrons from Zn to Pt species enriches the electron density of Pt, weakening the adsorption of electron-rich propylene. This helps suppress deep dehydrogenation and coke formation, improving catalyst stability and selectivity.

These support modification strategies work together to enhance the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the dispersion, interaction, and electronic properties of the active metal species on the support.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学特性，如酸强度和稳定性，在决定催化效率和选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。研究表明，在Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂中观察到的路易斯酸性表明Pt和Zn物种在Si-Beta支持体上存在强相互作用，这对催化过程有利。

形态特征，特别是活性金属物种的分散性，对于催化剂的最佳性能至关重要。研究表明，高度分散的Zn物种被沸石骨架脱铝产生的硅醇稳定，这些硅醇然后作为Pt物种的锚定点。这确保了Pt-Zn物种在支持体上的均匀分散，从而提高了催化效率。

用于优化这些性质的支持体改性策略包括：

1. 骨架脱铝：这创造了作为Zn和Pt-Zn物种锚定点的空位（硅醇），确保它们的均匀分散。

2. 顺序金属负载：研究表明，先负载Zn，然后负载Pt，比相反的顺序能获得更好的催化性能。这种策略有助于抑制Pt团聚并促进Pt-Zn相互作用。

3. 优化金属负载量：研究表明，找到最佳的Pt/Zn比例对实现最佳催化性能至关重要。这涉及平衡Pt和Zn物种之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用。

4. 电子转移调节：Zn到Pt物种的电子转移丰富了Pt的电子密度，减弱了富电子丙烯的吸附。这有助于抑制深度脱氢和焦炭形成，提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

这些支持体改性策略通过优化活性金属物种在支持体上的分散、相互作用和电子性质，共同作用以提高脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。
