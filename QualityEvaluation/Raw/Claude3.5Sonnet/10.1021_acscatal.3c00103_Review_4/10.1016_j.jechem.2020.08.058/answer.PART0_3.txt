[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts."

[3] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof."

[5] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Dispersion of active species: Highly-dispersed Zn and Pt species on the support lead to improved catalytic performance. This is achieved through stabilization by silanol groups created from zeolite framework dealumination.

2. Electronic interactions: The close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species contribute to the robustness of the catalyst. Electron transfer from Zn to Pt modifies the electronic properties of both species, affecting their catalytic behavior.

3. Acid-base properties: The introduction of Zn species creates Lewis acid sites, which can influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

4. Morphology: Homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the support ensures optimal use of the active components and enhances catalytic efficiency.

5. Adsorption properties: The modulation of Pt by Zn weakens the adsorption of propylene, which can help suppress undesired side reactions and coke formation.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Controlled dealumination: This creates silanol groups that act as anchoring sites for metal species, promoting their dispersion.

2. Careful selection of metal loadings and loading order: Optimizing the Pt/Zn ratio and loading Zn before Pt can enhance the dispersion and interaction of the active species.

3. Post-synthesis treatments: Calcination and reduction procedures can be tailored to optimize the electronic state and dispersion of the active species.

4. Use of microporous supports: Zeolites like Si-Beta provide a high surface area and confinement effects that can enhance catalytic performance.

By carefully controlling these factors, catalysts with enhanced efficiency and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions can be developed.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。关键因素包括：

1. 活性物种的分散性：高度分散的Zn和Pt物种在载体上可以提高催化性能。这是通过沸石骨架脱铝形成的硅醇基团稳定实现的。

2. 电子相互作用：Pt和Zn物种之间的紧密接触和电子相互作用有助于催化剂的稳定性。Zn到Pt的电子转移改变了两种物种的电子性质，影响其催化行为。

3. 酸碱性质：引入Zn物种会产生Lewis酸位，这可以影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

4. 形态：Pt-Zn物种在载体上的均匀分散确保了活性组分的最佳利用，提高了催化效率。

5. 吸附性质：Zn对Pt的调节减弱了丙烯的吸附，这有助于抑制不良副反应和积碳形成。

优化这些性质的载体修饰策略包括：

1. 受控脱铝：这会产生作为金属物种锚定位点的硅醇基团，促进其分散。

2. 仔细选择金属负载量和负载顺序：优化Pt/Zn比例并在Pt之前负载Zn可以增强活性物种的分散和相互作用。

3. 后合成处理：可以调整煅烧和还原程序以优化活性物种的电子状态和分散性。

4. 使用微孔载体：如Si-Beta等沸石提供高比表面积和限域效应，可以增强催化性能。

通过仔细控制这些因素，可以开发出具有增强效率和选择性的脱氢反应催化剂。
