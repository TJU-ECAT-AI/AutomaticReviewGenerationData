[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with an acceptable deactivation rate of ∼ 0.02 h−1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h−1 is achieved in the presence of H2."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities: The acid strength and stability of the catalyst play crucial roles. The study shows that the interaction between Pt and Zn species creates Lewis acid sites, which contribute to the catalyst's activity. The electron transfer from Zn to Pt species enriches the electron density of Pt, weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing coke formation.

2. Morphological characteristics: The dispersion of active metal species is critical. Highly dispersed Zn and Pt species on the support lead to better catalytic performance. The study demonstrates that framework dealumination creates silanol groups that act as anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.

3. Support modification strategies:
   a) Dealumination: This creates silanol groups that stabilize and disperse the active metal species.
   b) Bimetallic system: The use of Pt-Zn bimetallic system improves catalyst performance through electronic interactions and better dispersion.
   c) Controlling metal loading: Optimizing the Pt/Zn ratio is essential for achieving the best catalytic performance.
   d) Hydrogen addition: Adding H2 to the reaction system can significantly improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation.

These strategies result in enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, as evidenced by the high propylene production rate and low deactivation rate achieved with the optimized 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. Dispersion of active species: Highly-dispersed Zn and Pt species on the support enhance catalytic activity. This is achieved through the stabilization of Zn by silanol groups from zeolite framework dealumination, which then anchor Pt species.

2. Electronic interactions: The close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species contribute to the robustness of the catalyst. Electron transfer from Zn to Pt modifies the electronic properties of both species, affecting their catalytic behavior.

3. Acidity: The electron transfer from Zn to Pt creates Lewis acid sites, which can influence the catalytic process.

4. Adsorption properties: The electronic modification of Pt by Zn weakens the adsorption of propylene, which can help prevent unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

5. Morphology: The framework vacant sites created by dealumination act as anchoring points for active species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.

To optimize these properties, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Controlled dealumination: This creates silanol groups and framework vacancies that act as anchoring sites for active species.

2. Sequential metal loading: Adding Zn first, followed by Pt, helps maintain high dispersion and promotes Pt-Zn interaction.

3. Optimizing metal ratios: Balancing the Pt/Zn ratio is crucial for achieving the desired electronic interactions and catalytic performance.

4. Zeolite selection: Using a zeolite support like Si-Beta provides a high surface area and suitable framework for anchoring active species.

These strategies aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity by optimizing the dispersion, electronic properties, and stability of the active species on the support.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The chemical qualities, such as acid strength and stability, play a crucial role in determining catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The study reveals that the Lewis acidity observed in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts is indicative of strong interactions between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support, which is beneficial for the catalytic process.

Morphological characteristics, particularly the dispersion of active metal species, are essential for optimal catalyst performance. The research shows that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then serve as anchoring sites for Pt species. This ensures a homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the support, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency.

Support modification strategies employed to optimize these properties include:

1. Framework dealumination: This creates vacant sites (silanols) that act as anchoring points for Zn and Pt-Zn species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.

2. Sequential metal loading: The study demonstrates that loading Zn first, followed by Pt, results in better catalytic performance compared to the reverse order. This strategy helps suppress Pt agglomeration and promotes Pt-Zn interaction.

3. Optimizing metal loadings: The research shows that finding the optimal Pt/Zn ratio is crucial for achieving the best catalytic performance. This involves balancing the close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species.

4. Electron transfer modulation: The transfer of electrons from Zn to Pt species enriches the electron density of Pt, weakening the adsorption of electron-rich propylene. This helps suppress deep dehydrogenation and coke formation, improving catalyst stability and selectivity.

These support modification strategies work together to enhance the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by optimizing the dispersion, interaction, and electronic properties of the active metal species on the support.
