[1] "Characterization results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVvis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveal that highly-dispersed Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination, which then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."

[2] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."

[3] "The modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption"

[4] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."

[5] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with an acceptable deactivation rate of ∼ 0.02 h−1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 mol_C3H6 mol_Pt−1 s−1 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h−1 is achieved in the presence of H2."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities: The acid strength and stability of the catalyst play crucial roles. The study shows that the interaction between Pt and Zn species creates Lewis acid sites, which contribute to the catalyst's activity. The electron transfer from Zn to Pt species enriches the electron density of Pt, weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing coke formation.

2. Morphological characteristics: The dispersion of active metal species is critical. Highly dispersed Zn and Pt species on the support lead to better catalytic performance. The study demonstrates that framework dealumination creates silanol groups that act as anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species, ensuring their homogeneous dispersion.

3. Support modification strategies:
   a) Dealumination: This creates silanol groups that stabilize and disperse the active metal species.
   b) Bimetallic system: The use of Pt-Zn bimetallic system improves catalyst performance through electronic interactions and better dispersion.
   c) Controlling metal loading: Optimizing the Pt/Zn ratio is essential for achieving the best catalytic performance.
   d) Hydrogen addition: Adding H2 to the reaction system can significantly improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation.

These strategies result in enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, as evidenced by the high propylene production rate and low deactivation rate achieved with the optimized 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.

催化剂的物理化学性质对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响：

1. 化学性质：催化剂的酸强度和稳定性起着关键作用。研究表明，Pt和Zn物种之间的相互作用创造了Lewis酸位点，这有助于催化剂的活性。Zn到Pt物种的电子转移增加了Pt的电子密度，减弱了丙烯的吸附并抑制了积碳形成。

2. 形态特征：活性金属物种的分散性至关重要。高度分散的Zn和Pt物种在载体上可以带来更好的催化性能。研究表明，骨架脱铝形成的硅羟基作为Zn和Pt-Zn物种的锚定位点，确保了它们的均匀分散。

3. 载体改性策略：
   a) 脱铝：这创造了硅羟基，可以稳定和分散活性金属物种。
   b) 双金属体系：使用Pt-Zn双金属体系通过电子相互作用和更好的分散性改善催化剂性能。
   c) 控制金属负载：优化Pt/Zn比例对于获得最佳催化性能至关重要。
   d) 氢气添加：向反应体系中添加H2可以通过抑制积碳形成显著提高催化剂稳定性。

这些策略提高了催化效率和选择性，从优化的0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta催化剂所实现的高丙烯产率和低失活率可以证明这一点。
