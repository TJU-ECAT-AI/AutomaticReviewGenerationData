Stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts
Zeolitesmicroporous crystalline aluminosilicatesare widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis1,2,3 because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis. But the very presence of the micropores, with aperture diameters below 1nm, often goes hand-in-hand with diffusion limitations3,4,5 that adversely affect catalytic activity. The problem can be overcome by reducing the thickness of the zeolite crystals, which reduces diffusion path lengths and thus improves molecular diffusion4,5. This has been realized by synthesizing zeolite nanocrystals6, by exfoliating layered zeolites7,8,9, and by introducing mesopores in the microporous material through templating strategies10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 or demetallation processes18,19,20,21,22. But except for the exfoliation, none of these strategies has produced ultrathin zeolites with thicknesses below 5nm. Here we show that appropriately designed bifunctional surfactants can direct the formation of zeolite structures on the mesoporous and microporous length scales simultaneously and thus yield MFI (ZSM-5, one of the most important catalysts in the petrochemical industry) zeolite nanosheets that are only 2nm thick, which corresponds to the b-axis dimension of a single MFI unit cell. The large number of acid sites on the external surface of these zeolites renders them highly active for the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules, and the reduced crystal thickness facilitates diffusion and thereby dramatically suppresses catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during methanol-to-gasoline conversion. We expect that our synthesis approach could be applied to other zeolites to improve their performance in a range of important catalytic applications.
Main
In principle, zeolites will exhibit maximized molecular diffusion if the thickness of the crystal is reduced to the single unit cell dimension. Isolated zeolite unit cells (zero-dimensional crystal structure), nanowires (one-dimensional) and nanosheets (two-dimensional) would be obtained when confining the crystal thickness to the dimension of a single unit cell along three, two and one spatial dimensions, respectively. Of these three types of ultrathin zeolites, nanowires and nanosheets would be preferred in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ease of handling (they are collectable by filtration).
Although such ultrathin zeolites are easy to imagine, their actual synthesis is extremely difficult. This is because zeolite crystallization, like other crystallization processes, is accompanied by Ostwald ripening. Ostwald ripening is a naturally and spontaneously occurring process that minimizes the surface free energy of crystals, resulting in dissolution of smaller crystals and further growth of larger crystals. This thermodynamically controlled phenomenon becomes more significant as the crystal size decreases and therefore renders the synthesis of ultrathin zeolites extremely challenging. Although careful optimization of crystallization conditions6, or use of solid templates10,11,12,13 or organosilanes14,15,16 during synthesis resulted in zeolites with significantly reduced framework thicknesses, thicknesses were typically still between 5 and 100nm. Only the layer-by-layer exfoliation of a MWW (MCM-22) zeolite crystal7,8,9 yielded zeolites with ultrathin frameworks less than 5nm thick.
We approached the synthesis of MFI nanosheets by designing a di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant, C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H13 (designated C22-6-6 hereafter)23. The surfactant was composed of a long-chain alkyl group (C22) and two quaternary ammonium groups spaced by a C6 alkyl linkage (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for the three-dimensional molecular structure). The diammonium head group acted as an effective structure-directing agent for the MFI zeolite, while the hydrophobic interaction between the long-chain tails induced the formation of mesoscale micellar structure. With the surfactant, an ultrathin zeolite framework was formed at the hydrophilic part of the micelles while the hydrophobic tail restricted the excessive growth of zeolites. It is noteworthy that ordinary surfactants, with a single quaternary ammonium group, failed to function as an effective structure-directing agent for zeolite (generating amorphous MCM-41-type silicas)24,25.
MFI zeolites with Si/Al ratio of 30 to  were crystallized by using the diammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent. In a typical synthesis condition (Methods), the zeolite was obtained as multilamellar stacking of MFI nanosheets that were three-dimensionally intergrown (Fig. 1a). The overall thickness of the lamellar stacking was normally 2040nm. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigation of the cross-section (Fig. 1c) revealed that the stacking was composed of alternating layers of 2.0-nm-thick MFI zeolite framework and 2.8-nm-thick surfactant micelles. The zeolite layer was composed of three pentasil sheets, which corresponded to a single unit cell dimension along the b-axis (b = 1.9738nm). TEM investigation and electron diffraction on the layer surface identified it as the (010) surface of the MFI framework (Fig. 1b). The short arc in the electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 1b) indicated that each zeolite layer possessed high structural correlation in the ac plane orientation with a minor deviation. Only the h0l reflections were sufficiently sharp for indexing in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1d), confirming that the zeolite layer possessed large coherent domains characterized by wide ac planes while the framework thickness along the b-axis was extremely small. Elemental analysis revealed that the surfactant content was about 45wt% of the as-synthesized product. The surfactant content could be decreased to 19wt% (that is, a SiO2/surfactant molar ratio of 37) by extraction with an HCl/ethanol solution. The non-extractable content is supposed to be the amount entrapped in the zeolite micropores after the surfactant has acted as a structure-directing agent. The extractable portion is attributed to the surfactant molecules that are located in the surfactant micelle as dummy filler. On the basis of the elemental analysis and aforementioned TEM investigations, we propose that the material is composed of MFI layers wherein the surfactant molecules are aligned along the straight micropores of the MFI framework (Fig. 2a).

Because the surfactant layers provide interlamellar support (Fig. 2b), surfactant removal was expected to lead to the complete condensation of the MFI layers. However, the calcination actually led to a partial condensation only (Fig. 1e). The calcined product was highly mesoporous, although the mesopore size distribution was rather broad owing to the irregular distortion of zeolite layers (Fig. 1f). The calcined sample still exhibited a markedly enhanced BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) area (520m2g-1) compared to conventional MFI zeolite (420m2g-1). The retained mesoporosity can be explained as follows. First, as indicated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. 1a), there were a large number of crystal intergrowths. The intergrown crystals could act as a pillar supporting each other, preventing complete collapse of the mesoporous structure. Second, there were slight deviations of the crystal orientation in the ac plane, and this mismatch between the position of silanol groups on each MFI layers prevented the complete condensation of MFI layers.
In addition to the multilamellar form, MFI zeolite could also be synthesized in the form of unilamellar nanosheets (Fig. 3a) by reducing the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture (Methods). TEM images (Fig. 3b) revealed that the material was composed of a single MFI layer (that is, three pentasil sheets) having a very narrow ac plane; this material can thus be considered to be composed of essentially the same building blocks as the multilamellar form but without long-range stacking along the b-axis (Fig. 2c). The ability to produce these different forms indicates that crystal growth in the ac plane and layer stacking along the b-axis are significantly affected by the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture. The unilamellar zeolite exhibited a significantly increased surface area (710m2g-1), compared to its multilamellar counterpart (520m2g-1) (Fig. 3c).

The catalytic performance of the MFI nanosheets was investigated using large organic molecules so that diffusion of the reactant molecules constrains the reaction (Methods)26. As expected, the catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1). These enhanced catalytic activities can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (that is, on the external surface of the zeolite layer) of MFI nanosheets, with the unilamellar MFI generally exhibiting higher activities owing to its larger external surface area after calcination.

Another remarkable feature of the MFI nanosheets is their increased catalyst lifetime, which manifested itself when we investigated the catalytic properties of MFI zeolites in methanol-to-gasoline conversion. Owing to methanols small size, there was no significant difference in the initial catalytic activity between the ultrathin and the conventional MFI zeolite. With time on-stream, however, the MFI nanosheets were deactivated far more slowly than the conventional MFI (Fig. 4). To determine why, we monitored the quantity and location of coke formation during the reaction (Methods). As shown in Fig. 4, the MFI nanosheets exhibited not only much slower coke deposition than the conventional MFI (45 versus 170mgg-1 zeolite at 5days), but also coke formation almost exclusively at the external surface (that is, mesopores) while the conventional MFI zeolite showed major coke formation inside the micropores. Coke deposition within micropores causes more effective catalyst deactivation than external coke formation27,28 because internally deposited coke can cover the catalytically active acid sites and also block micropores already at low coking levels; in contrast, external coke causes relatively little hindrance to diffusion unless it covers the entire external catalyst surface. We therefore propose that the long catalytic lifetime of the MFI nanosheets is due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external zeolite surfaces, which arises because of facile mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores. Although we observed slow catalyst deactivation in the methanol-to-gasoline case study, it is expected that the MFI nanosheets would generally show high catalyst lifetime in various reactions29.

a, Conventional MFI zeolite. b, Unilamellar MFI zeolite. The unilamellar MFI zeolite exhibits a dramatically increased catalytic lifetime compared with its conventional counterpart, which is related to the preferential formation of coke in mesopores. Catalytic conversion over the unilamellar MFI was repeatedly investigated using three different synthesis batches (red circles, black squares, open circles, respectively). The catalytic measurement for conventional zeolite was repeated twice using the same sample (red circles and black squares). The solid black lines and the dotted red and black lines are guides to the eye. Dark blue bars indicate internal (inside the micropores of the zeolite) coke content, and light blue bars indicate external coke content.

The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications. 27Al magic-angle spinning NMR spectra indicated that approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al was retained in the zeolite framework even after being heated in 100% steam at 700C (Supplementary Fig. 5). In initial experiments, we also used the present synthesis strategy to create nanosheets of the zeolite MTW (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). This suggests that the structure-directing strategy that targets the mesoporous and microporous length scales simultaneously is fairly general, and that it can be extended to other zeolite structures and zeotype materials through the design of suitable bifunctional surfactants. The next challenge is to synthesize such porous materials in the form of continuous films or membranes for advanced applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation and sensor technologies.
Methods Summary
The C22-6-6 surfactant was synthesized in the bromide form, that is, C22-6-6Br2. This surfactant was mixed with tetraethylorthosilicate (or sodium silicates), aluminium sulphate, NaOH, H2SO4 and distilled water, to give a molar composition of 30Na2O:1Al2O3:100SiO2:10C22-6-6Br2:18H2SO4:4,000H2O. This mixture was heated at 150C for 5days in an autoclave (set on tumbling), to obtain the multilamellar MFI zeolite. The unilamellar MFI zeolite was synthesized at 1Al2O3:100SiO2:15C22-6-6(OH)2:3H2SO4:6,000H2O, at 150C for 11days, under sodium-free conditions. The hydroxide form of the surfactant was prepared through the anion exchange treatment of C22-6-6Br2. The conventional MFI zeolite (ZSM-5) used in this work was purchased from Zeolyst. All the zeolite samples possessed similar Si/Al ratios of 4153. All catalytic reactions were carried out after converting zeolites into the H+ form.
Online Methods
Synthesis of organic surfactant
C22-6-6Br2 was synthesized as follows: 39.0g (0.100mol) 1-bromodocosane (TCI) and 172g (1.000mol) N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-1,6-diaminohexane (Aldrich) were dissolved in 1,000ml acetonitrile/toluene mixture (1:1 vol/vol) and heated at 70C for 10h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was filtered, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50C. 56.2g (0.100mol) of the product and 24.6g (0.200mol) 1-bromohexane (Aldrich) were dissolved in 300ml acetonitrile and refluxed for 10h. After cooling to room temperature, the product was filtered, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50C.
Synthesis of nanosheet MFI zeolite
In a typical synthesis of multilamellar MFI nanosheets, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, from TCI), Al2(SO4)3·18H2O (Aldrich), NaOH, C22-6-6Br2, H2SO4 and distilled water were mixed to obtain a gel composition of 30Na2O:1Al2O3:100SiO2:10C22-6-6Br2:18H2SO4:4,000H2O. Water glass (an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, SiO2/Na = 1.75, 29wt% SiO2) may be used as a silica source instead of TEOS. The resultant gel was transferred to a Teflon-coated stainless-steel autoclave, and heated at 150C for 5days with the autoclave set to tumbling at 60r.p.m. After crystallization, the zeolite product was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 120C. The product was calcined at 550C for 4h under flowing air. For synthesis of unilamellar MFI, C22-6-6Br2 was converted to C22-6-6(OH)2 by passing aqueous solution through a column packed with anion exchange resin (MTO-Dowex SBR LCNG OH form, Supelco). The resultant solution contained 13wt% C22-6-6(OH)2. The C22-6-6(OH)2 solution, TEOS, Al2(SO4)3·18H2O and distilled water were mixed to obtain a gel composition of 1Al2O3:100SiO2:15C22-6-6(OH)2:3H2SO4:6,000H2O. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-coated stainless-steel autoclave, and heated at 150C for 11days with the autoclave set to tumbling at 60r.p.m.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns were taken with a Rigaku Multiflex diffractometer equipped with CuKα radiation (40kV, 40mA). SEM images were taken with a JEOL JSM-7401F at a low landing energy (0.30.6keV, in gentle-beam mode). The samples were mounted without crashing and metal coating. TEM images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-3010 with accelerating voltage of 300kV (Cs = 0.6mm, point resolution 0.17nm). N2 adsorption isotherms were measured at the temperature of liquid nitrogen with an ASAP2020 volumetric adsorption analyser. The BrunauerEmmettTeller equation was used to calculate the apparent surface area from the adsorption data obtained at P/P0 between 0.1 and 0.3. P, pressure; P0, standard pressure.
Catalytic reactions
For catalytic reactions, all MFI zeolites synthesized in the present work were NH4+-ion exchanged with a 1M NH4NO3 solution three times in all (NH4NO3/zeolite Al = 10, each time). The zeolite samples were converted to the H+ form through calcination in air at 550C. An MFI zeolite sample in NH4+ form was purchased from Zeolyst (sample codes CBV 8014, Si/Al = 41). The zeolite was also calcined at 550C. This zeolite is referred to as conventional zeolite.
The catalytic reactions involving large molecules were carried out and analysed, following methods reported in the literature26. Cracking of branched polyethylene was performed in a Pyrex batch reactor equipped with an overhead stirrer. 10g of polyethylene were placed in the reactor and melted at 350C. After the addition of 0.1g of catalyst, the reactor temperature was further increased to 380C. During the reaction, N2 gas was passed through the reactor at a rate of 40mlmin-1. After 30min reaction, the reaction yield was calculated from the mass change. Protection of benzaldehyde with pentaerythritol was carried out using a Pyrex batch reactor (EYELA chemistation) equipped with a reflux condenser. 1.06g benzaldehyde (10mmol), 0.68g pentaerythritol (5mmol), 4ml toluene and 20mg catalyst were placed into the Pyrex reactor and heated under stirring for 4h at 120C. Condensation of 2-hydroxyacetophenone with benzaldehyde was carried out by heating a mixture containing benzaldehyde (0.75g, 7mmol), 2-hydroxyacetophenone (0.48g, 3.5mmol) and 50mg catalyst at 150C for 14h.
The methanol-to-gasoline reaction was performed at 400C in a fixed-bed Pyrex reactor (inner diameter, 13mm) using 100mg of catalyst. Before reaction, catalysts were activated at 550C for 2h in a flowing air (30mlmin-1). Methanol (99.6%) vapour was introduced by passing N2 flow (50mlmin-1) through a saturation evaporator at 30C (weight hourly space velocity = 11.0h-1). By considering oxygenates (methanol and dimethylether) as unconverted species, conversion was calculated by gas chromatography analysis. After prolonged reaction time, the used catalyst was collected and coke content was analysed by thermogravimetric analysis (TA Instrument). The coke formation inside micropores (internal coke) was calculated from a decrease in micropore volume (determined by N2 adsorption), assuming coke density to be 1.22gcm-3 (ref. 27). The coke content deposited on the external surface was calculated by subtracting the internal coke content from the total coke content.
