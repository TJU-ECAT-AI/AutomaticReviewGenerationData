[1] "Zeolites—microporous crystalline aluminosilicates—are widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis1,2,3 because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis."

[2] "The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications."

[3] "27Al magic-angle spinning NMR spectra indicated that approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al was retained in the zeolite framework even after being heated in 100% steam at 700°C (Supplementary Fig. 5)."

[4] "The catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1). These enhanced catalytic activities can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (that is, on the external surface of the zeolite layer) of MFI nanosheets"

[5] "The MFI nanosheets exhibited not only much slower coke deposition than the conventional MFI (45 versus 170 mg g−1 zeolite at 5 days), but also coke formation almost exclusively at the external surface (that is, mesopores) while the conventional MFI zeolite showed major coke formation inside the micropores."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in catalytic reactions, including dehydrogenation reactions. 

Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability play crucial roles in catalytic efficiency. As mentioned in the literature, zeolites with strong acid sites enable size- and shape-selective catalysis. The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal and hydrothermal stability, as well as strong acidity, which are important for many catalytic applications. The stability of these catalysts is demonstrated by the retention of approximately 50% of the initial tetrahedral Al in the zeolite framework even after exposure to harsh conditions (100% steam at 700°C).

Morphological characteristics also greatly impact catalytic performance. The MFI nanosheets, with their unique structure, showed much higher catalytic activities compared to conventional MFI zeolite. This enhancement is attributed to the large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (external surface of the zeolite layer).

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Nanosheet formation: As demonstrated in the study, creating zeolite nanosheets significantly improves catalytic performance by increasing the number of accessible acid sites on the external surface.

2. Mesopore introduction: The presence of mesopores in the MFI nanosheets led to slower coke deposition and formation of coke primarily on the external surface, rather than inside micropores. This resulted in improved catalyst longevity.

3. Control of crystal thickness: Reducing the thickness of zeolite crystals to nanometer scale can reduce diffusion path lengths and improve molecular diffusion, enhancing catalytic activity.

4. Tailoring of Si/Al ratio: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, controlling the Si/Al ratio in zeolites is a common strategy to adjust acid strength and density.

5. Hierarchical structuring: Combining micropores and mesopores, as seen in the MFI nanosheets, can optimize mass transfer and increase the accessibility of active sites.

These strategies can be applied to various zeolite structures and potentially extended to other catalytic materials to enhance their performance in dehydrogenation reactions and other catalytic processes.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在催化反应（包括脱氢反应）中的性能有显著影响。

化学性质如酸强度和稳定性在催化效率中起着至关重要的作用。正如文献中所提到的，具有强酸位点的沸石能够实现尺寸和形状选择性催化。MFI纳米片表现出优异的热稳定性和水热稳定性，以及强酸性，这些特性对许多催化应用都很重要。这些催化剂的稳定性通过在苛刻条件下（700°C的100%蒸汽）仍能保留约50%的初始四面体铝在沸石骨架中得到证明。

形态特征也极大地影响催化性能。具有独特结构的MFI纳米片相比传统MFI沸石表现出更高的催化活性。这种增强归因于位于介孔表面（沸石层的外表面）的大量酸位点。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种载体改性策略：

1. 纳米片形成：如研究所示，创建沸石纳米片可以显著提高催化性能，增加外表面可接触的酸位点数量。

2. 介孔引入：MFI纳米片中介孔的存在导致焦炭沉积速度更慢，且焦炭主要形成在外表面而不是微孔内。这提高了催化剂的寿命。

3. 晶体厚度控制：将沸石晶体厚度减小到纳米级可以减少扩散路径长度，改善分子扩散，从而提高催化活性。

4. 调整Si/Al比：虽然在给定文本中没有明确提及，但控制沸石中的Si/Al比是调节酸强度和密度的常用策略。

5. 多级结构：如MFI纳米片所示，结合微孔和介孔可以优化物质传递并增加活性位点的可接触性。

这些策略可以应用于各种沸石结构，并可能扩展到其他催化材料，以提高它们在脱氢反应和其他催化过程中的性能。
