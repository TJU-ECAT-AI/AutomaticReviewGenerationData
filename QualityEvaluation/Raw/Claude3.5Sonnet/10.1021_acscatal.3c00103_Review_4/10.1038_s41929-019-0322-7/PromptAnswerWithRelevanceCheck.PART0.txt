The given literature does not contain information specifically about dehydrogenation reactions or support modification strategies for optimizing catalyst properties. The text focuses on polymer-nanocrystal hybrid catalysts for CO oxidation, discussing how polymer layers affect transition states and product diffusion. It does not address dehydrogenation reactions or the physicochemical properties influencing them.

[1] "Realizing a catalyst with this kinetic and transport control that can be used under demanding industrial conditions is challenging. Here, we show a modular approach for the systematic synthesis of polymernanocrystal hybrids, where palladium nanocrystals are encapsulated within tunable microporous polymer layers."

[2] "The polymer chemistry and morphology control the catalytic performance of the metal sites, affecting the transition state for CO oxidation and controlling the transport of CO2 away from the active site."

[3] "Microporous polymers are a class of materials that have emerged recently17,18 and that have found uses in gas storage and separation19. These materials contain the micropores that are necessary for confinement-driven catalysis, like in zeolites and some MOF-encapsulated materials, and also hold the promise of a higher degree of functionalization being possible with inclusion of additional chemical functional groups in monomers with high thermo-chemical stability."

[4] "By introducing functional groups that affect gas adsorption properties into microporous polymers, in principle it could be possible to affect the transport properties of reactive species through polymer pores as well as the energetic properties of catalytic intermediates that are present within microporous cavities."

The literature does not specifically discuss dehydrogenation reactions, but it provides insights into how physicochemical properties of catalysts can influence performance in other reactions, which may be applicable to dehydrogenation:

1. The chemistry and morphology of polymer layers encapsulating metal nanocrystals can control catalytic performance by affecting the transition state of reactions and controlling transport of products away from active sites.

2. Microporous polymers provide confinement-driven catalysis similar to zeolites and MOFs, while allowing for a higher degree of functionalization through the inclusion of additional chemical functional groups in monomers.

3. Introducing specific functional groups into microporous polymers can affect gas adsorption properties, potentially influencing the transport of reactive species through pores and the energetics of catalytic intermediates within microporous cavities.

4. The approach allows for tuning of microporous polymer layers, which can be used to systematically modify catalyst properties for use under demanding industrial conditions.

While not directly addressing dehydrogenation reactions, these principles of tuning catalyst properties through polymer encapsulation and functionalization could potentially be applied to optimize catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, enhancing efficiency and selectivity by controlling reactant/product transport and transition state energetics.

虽然文献没有具体讨论脱氢反应，但它提供了关于催化剂的物理化学性质如何影响其他反应性能的见解，这些见解可能适用于脱氢反应：

1. 包覆金属纳米晶的聚合物层的化学性质和形态可以通过影响反应的过渡态和控制产物从活性位点的传输来控制催化性能。

2. 微孔聚合物提供类似于沸石和MOFs的限域驱动催化作用，同时通过在单体中包含额外的化学官能团，允许更高程度的功能化。

3. 在微孔聚合物中引入特定的官能团可以影响气体吸附性质，潜在地影响反应物种通过孔隙的传输和微孔腔内催化中间体的能量学。

4. 这种方法允许调节微孔聚合物层，可用于系统地修改催化剂性质，以适应苛刻的工业条件。

虽然没有直接针对脱氢反应，但这些通过聚合物包覆和功能化来调节催化剂性质的原理可能可以应用于优化脱氢反应的催化剂，通过控制反应物/产物传输和过渡态能量学来提高效率和选择性。
