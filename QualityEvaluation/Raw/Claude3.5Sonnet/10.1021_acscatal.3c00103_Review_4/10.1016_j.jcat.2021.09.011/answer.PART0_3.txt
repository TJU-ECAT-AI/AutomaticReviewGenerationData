[1] "The presence of silanol nests in the resultant zeolite was confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies."

[2] "We suggest that the sodium-free synthesis results in the spontaneous generation of silanol nest defects, as in the case of post-synthetic degallation."

[3] "The generation of the silanol nests is believed to be affected by the absence of Na+ ions. They are known to promote the dissolution–recrystallization process during the zeolite crystallization, which in turn can heal the temporarily created defect sites and remove the silanol nests."

[4] "These results suggest that the silanol nests generated by the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br have a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior upon changes in the electronic state of Pt."

[5] "Furthermore, to confirm the effect of silanol nests, the PDH reaction was measured with PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl, where the zeolite support was synthesized by simply adding a small amount of NaCl into the synthesis gel composition for MZ-sf-Br. Despite the minor change of NaCl addition, there was a large difference in the PDH conversion between PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br-NaCl."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the presence of silanol nests, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Silanol nests, which are clusters of neighboring -SiOH groups associated with hydrogen bonding, play a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. These nanoparticles exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior due to changes in the electronic state of Pt, which enhances catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Sodium-free synthesis: This method results in the spontaneous generation of silanol nest defects, similar to post-synthetic degallation. The absence of Na+ ions during zeolite crystallization prevents the healing of temporarily created defect sites, allowing silanol nests to form.

2. Avoiding sodium-containing compounds: Adding even small amounts of sodium (e.g., NaCl) to the synthesis gel composition can significantly reduce the formation of silanol nests and negatively impact catalytic performance.

3. Direct synthesis methods: Techniques that generate silanol nests during the initial zeolite synthesis, rather than through post-synthetic treatments, can lead to improved catalytic properties.

4. Controlling metal loading: Optimizing the metal loading on the zeolite support can balance the benefits of increased active sites with the potential drawbacks of excessive metal facet areas that may promote coke formation.

These strategies aim to create a catalyst support with an optimal distribution of silanol nests, which in turn promotes the formation of highly active and stable intermetallic alloy nanoparticles for enhanced catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是硅醇巢的存在，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。硅醇巢是由氢键相连的相邻-SiOH基团组成的簇，在金属间合金纳米粒子的形成中起关键作用。这些纳米粒子由于Pt电子态的变化而表现出可逆的化学吸附行为，从而提高了催化效率和选择性。

优化这些性质的支持体修饰策略包括：

1. 无钠合成：这种方法导致硅醇巢缺陷的自发生成，类似于后合成脱镓。在沸石结晶过程中缺少Na+离子防止了临时创建的缺陷位点的愈合，从而允许硅醇巢的形成。

2. 避免含钠化合物：在合成凝胶组成中添加即使是少量的钠（如NaCl）也会显著减少硅醇巢的形成，并对催化性能产生负面影响。

3. 直接合成方法：在初始沸石合成过程中生成硅醇巢的技术，而不是通过后合成处理，可以带来改进的催化性质。

4. 控制金属负载：优化沸石载体上的金属负载可以平衡增加活性位点的好处与过多金属面可能促进焦炭形成的潜在缺点。

这些策略旨在创建具有最佳硅醇巢分布的催化剂载体，从而促进高活性和稳定的金属间合金纳米粒子的形成，以提高脱氢反应的催化性能。
