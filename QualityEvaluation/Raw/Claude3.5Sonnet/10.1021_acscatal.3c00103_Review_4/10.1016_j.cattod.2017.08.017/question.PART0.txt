Abstract
Zeolites are microporous aluminosilicates that are used extensively for a wide variety of industrial applications. Applications of microporous zeolites are limited to transformations of small molecules due to the pore diffusion limitation imposed by the microporous network structure. In order to overcome this limitation, zeolites with inter-/intra-crystalline mesopores are generally preferred. This review article presents the details of various strategies for the preparation of mesoporous zeolites with inter-/intra-crystalline mesopores. A wide range of soft templates and additives is described in details for their use in the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta zeolites. A brief report on the applications of mesoporous zeolites in various acid catalyzed reactions, involving large organic molecules, is provided in this article. Another important feature of this article is that it summarizes the applications of mesoporous zeolites in the electrochemical detection of various physiologically important biomolecules and organic/inorganic water pollutants. Further, the role of mesoporous zeolites based electrode materials for direct methanol fuel cell application is presented. Finally, the potential role of mesoporous zeolites in the field of biomedical engineering, particularly as a bone implant material, is summarized.

1. Introduction
When one thinks of a robust industrial catalyst for a wide range of applications, zeolites are mostly positioned at number one. The success of zeolites owes to their wide range of applications as ion-exchangers, in separation processes, and as shape selective heterogeneous catalysts, especially in petrochemical and fine chemical industries

. The term zeolite was given by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. He adopted this term from the Greek word zeolite which originally described those materials that upon heating produce large amount of steam. Such materials are naturally occurring. Till today over 40 zeolite framework structures have been found naturally and more than 230 type framework structure are described by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (IZA-SC)
[6]
.
Microporous zeolites are composed of MO4 (M = Si or Al) tetrahedral primary building units, connected through the corner-sharing of oxygen atoms to form a 3D porous framework structure that encloses pores of the molecular dimension (less than 1 nm). The wide spectrum of applications mentioned above are due to the tuneable interconnected porous network structure, Si/Al ratio, strong acidity, and textural properties (such as surface area and pore volume) etc. Applications of zeolites discussed above are determined by their structure. For example; gas separation and sorption ability depend on the size of the pore opening and void volume; ion-exchange property depends on the number and nature of cation exchange sites and their accessibility; catalytic property depends on Si/Al ratio, the pore opening, channel dimension and type, size and spacing of cages to host reactants & intermediates and so on. Therefore, the structural information of the zeolite framework is essential to exploit its reactivity. Framework structure describes the connectivity of the framework-atoms in the tetrahedral arrangements. It also defines the size and shape of the pore opening, the dimensions of the channel & cages, and the type of cation sites available but without reference to the chemical compositions. However, it must be noted that the chemical compositions and the post-synthetic modifications also play important roles in enhancing the zeolites applications. A three letter code is suggested by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association according to the rules set up by an IUPAC Commission on zeolite nomenclature. The codes are normally derived from the name of zeolite or type material. In this review emphasis has been made only to a few framework types such as MFI and BEA. MFI code is given to ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil-5) type materials. The details can be found in some selected review articles and books
[7]
. Each framework has a 3-dimensional, 4-connected framework structure constructed from corner sharing of TO4 tetrahedra, where T is any tetrahedral coordination cations. During the zeolite synthesis, primary building units (TO44) are self-assembled in the presence of inorganic cations to form secondary building units. The stabilized secondary building units arrange and form suitable framework structure with definite pore opening, channels, and cages. Pore opening are characterized by the 8/10/12 member O-ring channels that define porous architecture. An 8-member/10-member/12-member O-ring pore opening is classified as small pore/medium pore/large pore materials with effective pore diameter of 4.1 Å/5.5 Å/7.4 Å. For example, pentasil [51 × 4 = 54] describes the secondary building units that are linked to form pentasil chains, and mirror images of these chains are connected via oxygen bridges to form corrugated sheets with 10-ring holes. Each sheet is linked by oxygen bridges to form 3-dimentional, 5.5 Å medium pores ZSM-5 zeolite. Among the 7 disordered type framework structures, zeolite Beta corresponds to BEA family. Zeolite Beta structure is formed by joining [54] units to one another via 4-rings to form a layer with saddle-shaped 12 rings. Such a saddle-shaped layer can rotate in the clockwise or anticlock wise directions and is stacked together to form a 12 membered, 3-dimensional large-pore zeolite. Disorderness arises due to their possible rotation and stacking sequence. The details of stacking and framework structure of MFI and BEA framework can be found in some of the interesting compilations on zeolite science
[7]
,
[8]

[9]
.
Zeolites are synthesized in aqueous basic medium using silica source, alumina source, inorganic and/or organic cation. Zeolites are obtained through a kinetically controlled hydrothermal crystallization process since it is a meta-stable phase
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. Crystallized zeolites are removed from the synthesis mixture after certain time duration. By varying the synthesis composition and the cation (inorganic and/or organic), a wide variety of zeolites with different framework structures can be synthesized. Among all crystalline aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates, over 230 crystallographically distinct zeolite framework types have been synthesized and documented in the database of the International Zeolite Association
[6]
.
Zeolites are synthesized with the help of templates (also called structure directing agents, SDA), either in the form of charge balancing hydrated cations or small organic molecules. One framework type can be synthesized by one or more organic SDA. Similarly one organic SDA can form two different zeolite frameworks under different synthesis conditions. Factors influencing the zeolite synthesis are summarized in some selected literature
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. Moreover, one framework type can have different chemical compositions. The ratio of the main elements such as Si, Al or P is usually variable to a certain degree and can be specifically altered by inclusion of other (catalytically active) elements such as V, Ti, Ga, Zr, etc. Such flexibility in the structure and composition gives rise to tuneable chemical and physical properties even within one type of framework structure. Such tuneable properties thus make zeolites highly versatile and the top-notch material for a wide range of industrial applications.
Microporous zeolites are unique with respect to molecular sieving and shape/size selectivity but this is a limiting factor in the fine chemical industries or even in the petrochemical industries involving large organic molecules. The small size of the channels (less than 8 Å) and cavities (typically <15 Å) imposes diffusion constraints on reactions involving large organic molecules and exhibits high back pressure on the flow systems
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
that limits industrial applications of zeolites
[14]
,
[15]
. Further, in order to develop a recyclable catalyst based on a metal complex, it needs to be incorporated in the zeolite matrix either in the pores or on the surface through surface functionalization. Some of the metal complexes can fit well in the super-cage of zeolite matrix
[16]
. However, most of such complexes largely fail to fit in the porous structure due to the small pore openings. Homogenous metal complexes can be easily tethered on the support through surface silanol groups. Since the microporous zeolites neither have large external surface nor surface Si-OH groups, it is difficult to functionalize microporous zeolite. Similarly, catalytic active isolated metal/metal oxide phases can be incorporated in highly dispersed state if the zeolites have large external surface area to enable them to act as a multi-functional catalyst. The diffusion limitation and the inability of the surface functionalization have led to the role of microporous zeolites being limited in the fine chemical industry and for electrochemical applications. Through surface functionalization, it is possible to incorporate catalytically active species to make them useful in the fine chemical applications. Large external surface of zeolites is important to make them applicable in a wide range of electrochemical applications such as that for making sensing and energy materials. Therefore, the spectrum of application areas can be widened if larger external surface area and mesoporosity are incorporated in the zeolite matrix. This has encouraged researchers to develop synthetic strategies to create intra-/inter-crystalline mesoporosity in the zeolite materials. Researchers have developed synthetic strategies by which one can insert mesoporosity in the zeolite samples that are not ordered in the low angle region (termed as disordered mesoporous zeolites). Attempts have also been made to prepare mesoporous zeolites which have ordered structure in the low-angle length scale as well as in the wide-angle length scale (termed as ordered mesoporous zeolites).
In this review, the synthesis of ordered and disordered mesoporous zeolites are presented. Various methodologies reported for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites are presented with a detailed description of mesoporous zeolite synthesis using soft template method. This review is limited to the application of mesoporous zeolites in the acid catalyzed acylation and condensation reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals involving large organic molecules. Applications of mesoporous zeolites as sensors in the electrochemical detection of physiologically important biomolecules and organic/inorganic pollutants are presented along with their applications in methanol fuel cell. Finally, a brief summary on the role of mesoporous zeolite is presented in the biomedical applications.
2. Synthesis of mesoporous zeolites
Microporous zeolites are prepared using a wide variety of organic and inorganic cations. To improve the diffusion limitation imposed by microporous zeolites, several possible strategies have been explored which includes synthesizing zeolites with large pores, reducing the size of the zeolite crystals (resultant materials are termed as nanocrystalline zeolites having inter-crystalline mesopores), and inserting additional porosity in the materials to obtain interconnected microporous-mesoporous structure (termed as hierarchical zeolites). Diffusion limitation imposed by the intricate microporous network structure has created interest in the scientists to prepare materials which has mesopores in the length scale of 220 nm. This lead to the development of amorphous mesoporous aluminosilicates with different geometry
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
. However, the amorphous nature of their framework wall and the weak acidity limit their applications in the reactions requiring stronger acidic strength where zeolites play the dominant role. In an attempt to increase the acidity and thermal stability, pseudo-zeolitic mesoporous materials were prepared
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
. In this strategy, zeolite seeds were coated on the mesopore wall of the mesoporous aluminosilicate in order to increase the acidity. Such materials exhibited improved catalytic activity but their activities were far below than the expected activities with crystalline mesoporous zeolites. These results confirm that it is important to prepare materials which are similar to that of microporous zeolites in term of their crystallinity but have additional inter-/intra-crystalline mesoporosity.
Top-down and bottom-up approaches have been adopted to insert mesoporosity in the zeolite materials. In general, these approaches produce disordered zeolites. However, some successful bottom-up approaches have been reported to produce ordered zeolites with suitable type of SDA at an appropriate synthesis condition. Only a brief description is provided below for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite using top-down approach.
Dealumination: In this approach, the calcined form of zeolites is treated with acid to remove Al from the framework. During this process, almost all of the extra framework-Al and some framework-Al are removed by complexation with the acid
[27]
,
[28]
. This treatment is done using mineral acid or other organic acids such as oxalic/tartaric acid
[29]
. Improvement in the diffusion process due to the generation of disordered mesopores leads to improve the catalytic activity. One can increase the efficiency of the commercial zeolite samples by this process. However, with this process non-uniform mesopores are created. Further, framework Al is removed which reduces the total acidity of the sample. This process also influences the distribution of acid sites in the framework structure.
Desilication: In this strategy, the calcined form of zeolites is treated with a base, especially aqueous NaOH
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
. During this process, Si-O-Si cleavage takes place selectively which results desilication. Resultant materials exhibit decrease in the Si/Al and increase in the ion-exchange capacity. Improvement in the diffusion process is observed due to the generation of disordered mesopores. One can increase the efficiency of the commercial zeolite samples for selected catalytic applications using this approach. Using this approach, significant loss in the zeolite mass is observed in the form of dissolved silica in the aqueous mother solution. In this process, non-uniform mesopores are created.
Desilication followed by surfactant assisted synthesis: This process utilizes the limitation associated with desilication process mentioned above. In this method, desilication is performed with a mild bases such as NH4OH/dilute NaOH solution followed by the crystallization in the presence of an additional mesopore director (for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMABr))
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
. In this process, leached Si and other zeolite precursor species self-assemble using mesopore director to form mesoporous aluminosilicate. Researchers, in this procedure, observed improvement in the diffusion process owing to the generation of the uniform and the non-uniform mesoporous domains. Two different types of domains exist in the materials obtained with this method. One with true zeolite framework and the other with mesoporous domain coated with microporous zeolite. The latter domain of the material has non-uniform distribution of acid sites and cannot be termed as true zeolite framework.
In the bottom-up approach, zeolite molecular precursors are crystallized in the presence of template to produce mesoporous zeolite. Various bottom-up approaches have been developed for the preparation of mesoporous zeolites. Their advantages and limitations are provided below.
Zeolitization of amorphous mesoporous material (pseudo-zeolitic mesoporous material): In this method, pre-synthesized zeolite seeds were added to the conventional synthetic composition of mesoporous aluminosilicate
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
. In this process, as the amorphous mesoporous aluminosilicate domains grew, zeolite seeds were coated on the wall of amorphous mesoporous aluminosilicate. In another approach, zeolite seeds were grown and then added to the aqueous suspension of mesoporous aluminosilicate
[25]
,
[26]
. The synthesis was performed at low temperature (temperature suitable for the formation of mesoporous aluminosilicate). Improvement in the diffusion process was observed due to the generation of uniform mesoporous domain. One can achieve high activity in the fine chemical synthesis but not for those reactions which require strong acidity. Acidity of the resultant material was far low when compared to the true microporous zeolites. The material so obtained did not provide the XRD pattern corresponding to the crystalline microporous zeolite.
Hard template method: A pre-synthesized mesoporous material such as mesoporous silica, mesoporous carbon, polymers and similar such materials with well-defined porous architecture can be used as a hard template
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
. In general, for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites, carbonaceous materials are preferred
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
,
[38]
. Zeolite precursors are in-filtered in the carbon matrix for the growth to take place exclusively within the mesopores. This process produced materials with very uniform pore size just smaller than the pore size of porous carbon. In contrast, when excess of zeolite precursor was used, crystallization occurred on the surface as well as in the pores resulting in mesoporous zeolite with non-uniform pores. After the synthesis, carbon templates were removed by calcination to get pure zeolite. The advantage of this method is that one can prepare any type of zeolite framework with well-defined porosity and improved catalytic activity. The limitation of this method is that it is very costly process because it requires hard template. Further, this process is limited to very small scale synthesis.
Soft template method: This is the most versatile synthetic method due to the presence of a wide variety of soft-templates. Since a wide range of soft templates can be synthesized, a wide range of mesoporous zeolites can be prepared. In this method, zeolite precursors are self-assembled in the presence of a mesopore directing agent. In this method, a suitable type of structure directing agent is required to generate a particular framework structure. Thus, one can prepare zeolites of different framework structure. Zeolites can be synthesized in large scale with improvement in the catalytic activity and retardation in the rates of catalytic deactivation process. Only a particular type of surfactant under a certain synthesis condition can lead to the production of a highly ordered mesoporous zeolite. Very recently, the advances in the synthesis of new zeolite structures are summarized
[41]
. These zeolite structures have been achieved by utilization of the synthetic strategies based on pre-designed structure-directing agents.
In the present review, details of various soft templates reported for the synthesis of ordered and disordered mesoporous zeolites are summarized with a special emphasis on the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta. ZSM-5 rules the petrochemical industry whereas Beta rules the fine chemical industry. Therefore, significant emphasis is made towards the synthesis of these two zeolites. Among these two zeolites, significant efforts have been made for the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5 because the diffusion limitation is a serious obstacle in ZSM-5 zeolite. Furthermore, the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite is simple when compared to that of zeolite Beta.
2.1. Synthesis of disordered mesoporous zeolite using additives and soft templates
Initial attempts to synthesize mesoporous zeolite using CTMABr failed. Later, attempts to crystallize mesoporous zeolite were made by the combination of surfactants (micropore surfactant tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) and mesopore director CTMABr). In this process, two templates did not cooperatively participate during the crystallization and it turned out to be a physical mixture of microporous zeolite and mesoporous aluminosilicate domains. These experiments provided evidence that conventional mesopore director was not suitable for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite. Following these attempts, several additives and soft-templates were used to prepare disordered mesoporous zeolites (
Scheme 1
,
Scheme 2
). It was anticipated that when a suitable additive is added to the synthesis composition of conventional zeolite, it could retard the growth of zeolite crystals and thereby shorten the diffusion path and improve the catalytic activity. The addition of alkyltriethoxysilane and phenylaminopropyl-trimethoxysilane was found to be successful
[42]
,
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
. Phenylaminopropyl-trimethoxysilane was found to be successful for the synthesis of ZSM-5 and Beta nanocrystals
[42]
. Later, detailed study based on alkyltriethoxysilane was performed to systematically investigate the role of various alkyltriethoxysilane and aminoalkylsilanes in the synthesis of ZSM-5 nanocrystals
[43]
,
[44]
. Alkyltriethoxysilane molecules (which contains a hydrolysable alkoxysilyl moiety) interacted well with the growing crystal domains through the formation of covalent bonds with zeolite precursors (SiO2 and Al2O3 sources) using the alkoxysilyl moiety. Alkylalkoxysilanes contain only three hydrolyzable moieties (with one hydrophobic alkyl group), which was disadvantageous for the formation of extended tetrahedral SiO2 linkages. Consequently, the zeolite growth was significantly retarded at the organic and inorganic interfaces, which thereby resulted in the formation of inter-crystalline mesopores in the resulting material. Physicochemical characterizations showed that the zeolite samples prepared with propyltriethoxysilane and methyltriethoxysilane had spherical/egg-shape morphology, which was built with nano-sized zeolite crystals and mesopores were present in the voids between the nanocrystals. The surface area of the obtained materials follows the order shown in
Table 1
. This clearly indicates that moderate length alkyl chain-containing organosilanes have a strong interaction with the growing crystals and, hence, effectively modulate the zeolite crystallization to form high surface area zeolite nanocrystals. The long-alkyl chain hydrophobic octyltriethoxysilane was found to be less effective, as it could be segregated from the aluminosilicate domain. It was unable to modulate the crystallization process by participating in the crystal growth. A new kind of organosilane (1,6-bis(diethyl(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)ammonium) hexane bromide) with a Gemini type structure was prepared and used as a mesoporogen for the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite
[45]
. ZSM-5 materials prepared with (1,6-bis(diethyl(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)ammonium) hexane bromide) exhibited low surface area when compared to ZSM-5 prepared with propyltriethoxy silane (
Table 1
). Disordered mesoporous ZSM-5 was also synthesized using a wide range of multi-cationic SDA
[46]
,
[47]
,
[48]
. ZSM-5 prepared with propyltriethoxy silane exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activities for the synthesis of large molecules that cannot enter zeolite micropores
[43]
. Such high catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of small zeolite crystals and the presence of inter-crystal mesopores between them. This also shortened the diffusion path and enhanced the diffusion of reactant/product molecules.

As indicated above, that mono-cationic long chain CTMABr/Cl failed to produce mesoporous zeolite but di-cationic and multi-cationic SDA were found to be successful in the synthesis of disordered ZSM-5. Some of these SDA and the textural properties of resultant materials are shown in
Scheme 1
,
Scheme 2
and

. Although a wide range of SDAs were successful in the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5
[49]
,
[50]
,
[51]
,
[52]
,
[53]
,
[54]
,
[55]
, only a certain class of SDA could ably to produce disordered mesoporous Beta
[50]
,
[51]
,
[52]
,
[53]
. The formation of disordered mesoporous Beta using some di-cationic SDA indicates that the presence of two ammonium groups in the same molecule could be the most important factor for the generation of zeolite with inter-crystalline mesoporosity. It is proposed that the diammonium type SDAs were able to generate a large number of zeolite seeds when compared to their monoammonium analogues tetraethylammonium (TEA+) halide
[49]
. The XRD analysis confirmed the formation of a pre-organized zeolite-like assembly during gelation (0 h, before crystallization)
[49]
. This process reduced the nucleation time. Further crystal growth took place rapidly to form the nanocrystalline zeolite Beta. In one of the detailed works, it has been shown that a wide range of similar SDAs were prepared but only a specific SDA was capable of producing zeolite Beta
[51]
. In one of the pioneer works, it has been reported that the formation of zeolite Beta took place using SDA-20 and SDA-21 with molecular dimensions less than that of the pore channels of the 12-member ring of Beta with pore dimensions: 6.6 × 6.7 Å for
[100]
and 5.6 × 5.6 Å for [001]
[50]
. However, synthesis of zeolite Beta using SDA-13 to SDA-17 shown in
Scheme 2
and previous reports clearly demonstrate that this may not be the necessary condition for the formation of zeolite Beta

The molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the conformational changes by thermal rotation and vibration were greatly suppressed, even at elevated temperature (473 K), due to their rigid cyclic geometry. Such a limited conformational freedom is known as an important prerequisite for the selective structure direction of zeolites
[55]
. Theoretical modelling suggested that piperidine chair conformation was the appropriate conformation for the SDA to form zeolite Beta
[49]
,
[51]
. In order to confirm this hypothesis, several new, long chain SDA, which contain 4,4-trimethylenebis(1-methylpiperidine), were prepared and investigated in the synthesis of zeolite Beta (

)
[52]
. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that 4,4-trimethylenebis(1-methylpiperidine) moiety was required to direct 12-membered micropores with Beta framework structure for various piperidine based SDA
[53]
. The geminal-type surfactant species were designed to promote the formation of both micropores as well as mesopores concomitantly, in the same material. The mesopores were generated by the aggregation of the surfactant molecules, whereas the crystallization of microporous Beta framework was directed by the quaternary ammonium groups derived from 4,4-trimethylenebis(1-methylpiperidine) moiety within the mesopore wall. It was interesting to observe that 4,4-trimethylenebis(1-methylpiperidine) moiety based SDA-18 did not produce zeolite Beta. In SDA-17, a long alkyl ammonium chain is separated by a p-xylene unit whereas in SDA-18, it is separated by aliphatic linear C6H12 unit. The DFT optimized structures revealed that piperidine rings exist in the chair conformation in the case of SDA-16 and SDA-17
[52]
, which seems to be an appropriate conformation for SDA to form zeolite Beta. In SDA-18, the piperidine ring exists in the twist-boat conformation, which is an inappropriate conformation for SDA to form zeolite Beta
[52]
. These studies confirmed that just having a suitable organic moiety in the molecular structure of SDA may not lead to the formation of zeolite Beta. It is the suitable special orientation of the piperidine rings in the SDA, which was responsible for the formation of disordered mesoporous Beta. Disordered mesoporous Beta/ZSM-5 were also crystallized in the presence of tetraethylammonium hydroxide(TEAOH)/tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and a mesoscale cationic polymer SDA-24
[53]
. Mesoporous Beta with disordered structure was prepared using alkyl chain containing dicationic SDA-22 and SDA-23. With these SDA-22 and SDA-23, nanocrystalline Beta samples (1020 nm) were synthesized under broad Si/Al ratios (1530) in alkaline and fluoride media with excellent yields (above 95%)
[56]
. Disordered mesoporous Beta was prepared using commercial cationic polymer (SDA11/SDA-19) that acted as a dual function template to generate zeolite micropores and mesopores, simultaneously
[57]
. Disordered mesoporous Beta with multi-modal mesoporous architecture was obtained using cationic polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride. In this study, it has been demonstrated that the mesopore size was tuned in the range of 40400 nm just by varying the polymer amount. This one-step procedure offers a convenient and inexpensive synthesis route to prepare customized hierarchical zeolitic beta materials within 3 days
[58]
.
Disordered mesoporous Beta exhibited promising catalytic activity in the acid catalyzed alkylation and acylation reactions
[48]
,
[51]
. Catalytic activities of disordered mesoporous Beta were found to be extremely high when compared to conventional Beta for reactions involving large organic molecules. High catalytic activity of disordered mesoporous Beta was attributed to the accessibility of large reactant molecules to the strong acid sites and to the facile diffusion of large reactant and product molecules though mesoporous channel.
2.2. Synthesis of ordered mesoporous zeolites
Previous section described that a wide range of di-cationic and multi-cationic SDA could ably produce disordered mesoporous zeolites. However, it was difficult to achieve the order in both length scale (micropore and mesopore). Only a few successes have been made in this direction which leads to the production of ordered mesoporous ZSM-5. One special type of amphiphilic organosilane [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]hexadecyldimethylammonium chloride (SDA-27) and their structural analogues were prepared (
Scheme 3
)
[59]
. Amphiphilic surfactant molecules contain a hydrolysable methoxysilyl moiety, a zeolite structure-directing group such as quaternary ammonium, and a hydrophobic surfactant-like long-chain alkyl ammonium moiety linked together by a SiC bond, which was chemically stable under the synthetic condition of zeolite. As discussed above, such amphiphilic organosilanes could strongly interact with growing crystal domains through the formation of covalent bonds with other SiO2 and Al2O3 sources using the methoxysilyl moiety. This template produced ordered mesoporous ZSM-5. The formation of the ordered mesoporous ZSM-5 particles was well supported by a small-angle XRD peak (appearing at 0.7) and the wide angle XRD peaks corresponding to the MFI framework structure
[59]
. One interesting feature of this template was that one can tune the mesopore diameter of the zeolite by varying the chain length of the organosilanes and/or the temperature of the hydrothermal synthesis. The strategy for the synthesis of ordered zeolite based on the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules is one of the most effective methods for the preparation of hierarchical zeolites. Surfactants with multi-quaternary ammonium head groups have directed the formation of ordered MFI nanosheets without the use of any microporous directing agents

Later, multi-quaternary ammonium surfactants based on long chain C22H45 and C18H37 were investigated for the synthesis of ordered ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheets
[45]
,
[46]
,
[61]
,
[62]
,
[63]
. A series of C22H45N+(CH3)2CiH2iN+(CH3)2C6H13 were prepared: (a) when i = 3, it formed bulk MFI crystals; (b) when i = 6 then ordered zeolite nanosheets were obtained (
Scheme 3
); (c) when i = 8, the nanosheets were assembled in a disordered manner. Based on the results obtained, following conclusions were derived: at least two ammonium groups were required for the formation of the zeolite nanosheets. The first ammonium group, which was bonded directly to the surfactant tail, did not seem to function as a template for the zeolite structure. The thickness of the nanosheets was tailored by varying the number of ammonium groups except the one bonded directly to the surfactant tail. A versatile method of synthesis has been described for the preparation of ordered mesoporous ZSM-5 composed of ultrathin ZSM-5 frameworks using amorphous linear-chain polymers functionalized with a random distribution of side groups that can participate in the zeolite crystallization (
Scheme 3
)
[64]
. Tight binding of the side groups with zeolite precursors enforced strain in the polymer backbones, limiting the crystallization to the ultrathin micellar scale
[64]
.
ZSM-5 nanosheets were synthesized using multi-quaternary ammonium surfactants based on 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). The surfactant was composed of a long alkyl chain (C18H37) and DABCO quaternary ammonium groups spaced by a C6 alkyl linkage
[47]
. The quaternary ammonium head group acted as an effective SDA for the ZSM-5 zeolite, whereas the hydrophobic interaction between the long-chain tails induced the formation of inter-/intra-crystalline mesopores. Both wide-angle and small-angle diffraction patterns were obtained using only a suitable kind of SDA (SDA-25 and SDA-26) under a specific composition in zeolite synthesis. It is reported that appropriately designed surfactants under a particular synthesis gel composition could direct the formation of zeolite structures on the mesoporous and microporous length scales simultaneously and yielded ordered ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheet
[47]
. An optimum amount of ethanol was required for the formation of ZSM-5 zeolite having a small-angle XRD pattern. Supramolecular templating action of SDA-26 having a bulky hydrophilic head group yields a small g value (1/3 < g < 1/2) at ambient temperature, which resulted in the formation of a disordered hexagonal phase (
Scheme 4
). However, at high temperatures in a basic solution, the long hydrophobic tail could increase the effective surfactant volume (V). Accordingly, due to the large g value, the hexagonal assembly could transform to a multi-lamellar mesophase with low surface curvature. The multi-quaternary ammonium head group could strongly interact with silicate species in their composites, and therefore, the phase transformation seems to occur very fast in this case resulting in highly ordered mesoporous ZSM-5 nanosheet. It was found that the formation of a micellar mesophase was disfavoured in the presence of a large amount of ethanol
[47]
. Despite the small thickness, the nanosheet architecture was highly stable under thermal and steam-heat treatment conditions at a very high temperature, and it retained the ZSM-5 framework structure. Strong acid sites were present on the external surface of the zeolite nanosheet. Having encouraged from the report on multi-cationic SDA for the synthesis of ordered ZSM-5 zeolite, a series of new tetra-head group rigid bolaform quaternary ammonium surfactants (SDA-31 to SDA-33,
Scheme 3
) were prepared and found successful towards the synthesis of ordered mesoporous ZSM-5
[65]
. However, the textural properties of resultant materials were lower when compared to the materials prepared with SDA-26 and SDA-28 (
Table 1
). A unique one-step synthesis of a hierarchical self-pillared ZSM-5 zeolite composed of orthogonally connected microporous nanosheets was realized using tetrabutylphosphonium (TBP)silica and tetrabutylammonium (TBA)silica sols
[66]
. The nanosheets were 2 nm thick and contained a network of 0.5 nm micropores. The house-of-cards arrangement of the nanosheets created a permanent network of 2 nm to 7 nm mesopores, and resembled a house-of-cards construction.

Ordered mesoporous ZSM-5 exhibited excellent activity in the acid-catalyzed reactions involving large molecules that cannot enter the micropores of conventional zeolites
[47]
,
[67]
,
[68]
. Furthermore, they exhibited significant retardation in the catalyst deactivation for several vapour phase reactions that require strong acidity
[68]
. The large number of acid sites on the external surface of these zeolites rendered them highly active for the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules, and the reduced crystal thickness facilitated the diffusion process, thereby improving their performance in a range of important catalytic applications with retardation in the catalyst deactivation.
2.3. Strategies for preparing mesoporous zeolites of different framework structure using one mesopore director
A wide range of mono-cationic and multi-cationic mesopore directors have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites of different framework structures. It is important to note that for every framework type zeolite, a special type of mesopore director is required. This has led to the development of a wide range of soft templates for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites (
Scheme 1
,
Scheme 2
). Only a few SDA have been successful in the synthesis of more than one zeolite framework. For example, a mesoscale cationic polymer, polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDADMAC) was found to be successful in the synthesis of mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta using TPAOH and TEAOH as micropore structure directing agents
[53]
. One-step, direct synthetic strategy using the combination of a zeolite microporous structure directing agent and di-cationic SDA-28 was used to synthesize mesoporous ZSM-5, MOR, and SOD zeolite nanocrystals
[69]
. The nanocrystal formation was attributed to the strong cooperative binding of the SDA-28 and micropore directing agent with the growing zeolite phase, when compared to the monovalent long chain surfactant such as CTMABr. Long hydrophobic chain of SDA-28 facilitated the ordered stacking of microporous zeolite layers to produce nanosheet-like morphology. ZSM-5 framework forms sinusoidal 10-member rings channels along the a-axis, interconnected with 10-member ring straight channels along the b-axis. A tortuous porous architecture is present along the c-axis (
Scheme 5
). It is well documented that small tetrapropylammonium (TPA) cations are situated at the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels
[70]
. Bulkier mono-cationic or di-quaternary ammonium cations with n >4 are known to fit well in the straight channels than along the sinusoidal channels
[70]
,
[71]
,
[72]
. The synthesis of ZSM-5 takes place using only TPABr, because one TPA can be located at the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels, whereas two or more TPA cations can fit into the straight channels along the b-axis. When one equivalent of di-quaternary SDA-28 and one equivalent of TPABr were used, TPA cations seemed to prefer locating themselves at the intersection of the straight and the sinusoidal channels. However, di-quaternary ammonium cations seemed to prefer occupying the straight channels along the b-axis and form the ZSM-5 framework structure (
Scheme 5
). During the initial stage of synthesis, nucleation of the ZSM-5 framework structure took place in the presence of TPABr and SDA-28 cations. Growth process was preferred to take place along the ac plane due to the presence of hydrophobic long tail surfactant molecules along the b-axis and form wide ZSM-5 layer along the ac plane (
Scheme 5
). These ZSM-5 layers were stacked along the b-axis to provide multi-lamellar architecture (
Scheme 5
). The multi-lamellar grown crystals acted as a pillar supporting each other, preventing the collapse of the mesoporous structure to form mesoporous ZSM-5.

3. Application of mesoporous zeolites
Evolution of mesopores in zeolite catalysts increases their industrial and environmental demands. The indispensable roles of modulating pore models for zeolite catalysts for the enhancement of their catalytic performances in various industrial processes is recently summarized
[73]
. The rational construction of pore models, especially hierarchical features, is highlighted with respect to industrial perspective in this report
[73]
. The role of mesoporous zeolites should be demonstrated using a suitable kind of model reactions. Several model reactions have been explored to demonstrate the benefit of the hierarchical pore system with respect to their suitability to prove the positive effects of hierarchical porous zeolites
[74]
. It is important to note that positive effects on activity, stability and selectivity observed for hierarchically structured catalysts not always due to the presence of additional meso- or macropores but also the number, strength and location of active sites as well as defects and impurities present in the sample.
Mesoporous zeolites exhibited higher catalytic activity in various acid catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity. Activities of mesoporous zeolites are similar to that of the conventional zeolites in the reactions involving small molecules. Moreover, mesoporous zeolites exhibited significant retardation in the catalyst deactivation in vapour phase and liquid phase reactions when compared with conventional zeolites. The application window of mesoporous zeolites can be widened due to their large surface area, inter-crystalline mesopores, tuneable hydrophobicity, surface functionalization capabilities and so on. Some of these applications are provided in the following sub-sections:
3.1. Comparative catalytic activity of mesoporous ZSM-5 and mesoporous beta with conventional zeolites
In an interesting report, ordered and disordered zeolites with ZSM-5 and Beta framework were investigated in the FriedelCrafts acylation and benzoylation reactions
[75]
. Mesoporous ZSM-5 materials (ZSM-5-PrTES and ZSM-5-SDA-26) exhibited significantly higher activity than conventional ZSM-5. Conventional ZSM-5 exhibited negligible activity towards acylation of aromatic methoxy compounds and heterocyclic compounds, which confirmed that the acylation reactions were not feasible because catalytically active sites were located inside the micropores of ZSM-5 (
Table 3
,
Table 4
,
Table 5
). Again, mesoporous Beta (Beta-SDA-13) was found to be more active than conventional Beta. This difference in the activity can be correlated to the large surface area and inter-/intra-crystalline mesopores. In the case of mesoporous zeolite materials, the acid sites located at the pore-mouth or little bit farther inside the channels were the real centres of the reaction. Inter-crystalline mesopores present in the mesoporous zeolites facilitated the diffusion of the reactant to the acid sites and diffusion of the product from the active sites, which was responsible for the high activity. High reactant conversion in the case of ZSM-5-SDA-26 can be correlated well with its large mesopore volume when compared to ZSM-5-PrTES. High reactant conversion in the case of Beta-SDA-13 can be correlated to the high acidity obtained using TPD. If Si/Al is taken into consideration, then the activity (average TOF) in the case of ZSM-5-SDA-26 would be more than Beta-SDA-13. However, considering the activity based on TOF would not be appropriate because of two reasons: First, it was difficult to know the concentration of the actual acid sites, where the reaction took place; second, most of the acidic centres were unavailable for bulkier molecules. Thus, the real TOF was difficult to calculate. The catalytic activity data for the benzoylation of dihydroxy benzene isomers over these catalysts are summarized in
Table 5
. ZSM-5 was found to be inactive, but mesoporous ZSM-5 exhibited good activity. High selectivity for the O-benzoylated product was observed in the benzoylation reaction of resorcinol using mesoporous ZSM-5. In the benzoylation of resorcinol, zeolite Beta was found to exhibit better activity than mesoporous ZSM-5 not only with respect to resorcinol conversion, but also with respect to the selectivity for the C-benzoylated product. Further, increase in the resorcinol conversion and selectivity for the desired C-benzoylated product were observed in the case of mesoporous Beta, which can be correlated to the large mesopore volume when compared to Beta. Conversion of the reactant was correlated with the mesopore surface area (Sexternal)/mesopore volume (Vmeso) for the different samples. For illustration, conversion (of anisole, 2-methoxy naphthalene, indole, and resorcinol) versus Sexternal/Vmeso of ZSM-5 and Beta samples was plotted (
Fig. 1
). These representations clearly justify the influence of mesoporosity on the catalytic activity. Based on these studies, it could be concluded that mesoporous ZSM-5 can have an almost equal or more activity (when Si/Al is taken into consideration) than mesoporous Beta in most of the acid catalyzed reactions. However, there are a few reactions where mesoporous Beta could play a better role than mesoporous ZSM-5. Therefore, successful synthesis of these two mesoporous zeolites would be very important from the industrial perspective.

3.2. Electrocatalytic activity of mesoporous zeolite
The role of microporous zeolites have been demonstrated in the gas sensor applications
[76]
,
[77]
, however only a handful of reports are available for their analytical applications especially as electrochemical sensors
[78]
. The most of these applications are due to the ion-exchange property of the microporous zeolites
[79]
,
[80]
,
[81]
,
[82]
,
[83]
,
[84]
. Iron (III) doped zeolite modified carbon paste electrode was developed for the sub-micromolar determination of tryptophan, uric acid, and ascorbic acid in the aqueous solution
[79]
. Further, iron-doped natrolite zeolite-multiwall carbon nanotube was developed for the simultaneous and sensitive determination of ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid, and tryptophan
[80]
. Iron-enriched natural zeolite modified carbon paste electrode was also developed for H2O2 detection
[81]
. Co (II)-exchanged zeolite Y modified carbon paste electrode was investigated in voltammetric determination of l-cysteine
[82]
. The scope for ammonium exchanged zeolite-Y modified carbon paste electrode was investigated in the voltammetric detection of Cd (II) and Pb (II) ions in groundwater resources and industrial effluents
[83]
. Very recently, lanthanum-impregnated mordenite zeolite modified carbon paste electrode was developed for the determination of Cd (II)
[84]
.
Mesoporous zeolites could play an important role in various inter-disciplinary research areas because of their enhanced textural properties, compared to the conventional micron-sized zeolites. Small particle size and mesoporosity present in these materials decrease the diffusion path length and provide readily accessible active sites in the fine chemical synthesis involving large molecules. These are some of the important characteristics owing to which they are applicable in electrochemical applications. Application of less conductive zeolites in the construction of electrochemical sensors and biosensors is limited because they do not contain any redox metal in their framework structure. Recently, it was reported that it is possible to use the native form of zeolite for the electrochemical detection of water pollutants
[85]
. Different framework structure zeolites (Beta, ZSM-5, and LTA) were investigated in the electrochemical detection of environmental water pollutants namely, dihydroxybenzene isomers (hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CC), and resorcinol (RC)). Pore diameters of zeolite A, ZSM-5, and Beta are 4.2 Å, 5.5 Å, and 6.5 Å. The current sensitivity of LTA-SDA-27 were marginally higher when compared to LTA although the surface area of LTA-SDA-27 (SBET = 255 m2/g, Sext = 162 m2/g) was higher than LTA (SBET = 152 m2/g, Sext = 52 m2/g). This observation confirmed that small pore zeolite A was not good for the detection of dihydroxybenzene isomers. An increase in the current response for LTA-SDA-27 compared to zeolite LTA confirmed that LTA-SDA-27 possesses more number of surface Si-OH which was responsible for the increment in the LTA-SDA-27 activity. Response currents with Beta-SDA-13 and ZSM-5-PrTES were much higher than that of Beta and ZSM-5, respectively. This observation confirmed that large external surface area and a large number of surface Si-OH were responsible for the high electrocatalytic activity. This increased electrocatalytic activity of mesoporous zeolite was due to their large micropore size, high surface area, large external surface area, abundantly available Si-OH groups, and inter-crystalline mesopores. Facile diffusion and favourable interaction sites provided by Beta-SDA-13 were responsible for the significantly high current response and sensitivity compared to other zeolite materials investigated in this study (
Fig. 2
a,
Table 6
). ZSM-5-PrTES also exhibited very good activity in the electrochemical detection of these molecules. Further, the structure directing agent required for the synthesis of mesoporous Beta-SDA-13 is costly and need to be synthesized (as it is not commercially available). Whereas, the additive used in the synthesis of ZSM-5-PrTES is commercially available at reasonable price. ZSM-5-PrTES is comparatively easy to synthesize. Considering the commercial perspective, electrochemical sensors based on ZSM-5-PrTES were developed for the electrochemical determination of other analytes.

For most of the electrochemical applications, it is important to incorporate redox active sites in the zeolite matrix. One can incorporate active metal centres via ion-exchange, incorporation of metal in the framework structure, and support metal oxide/metal nanoparticles on the large external surface of the mesoporous zeolite. At least one example of each such system is described in this review. Transition metal ion-exchanged ZSM-5-PrTES (where transition metal = Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+) modified electrodes were fabricated for the electrochemical detection of glucose

. Among the various transition metal-ion exchanged ZSM-5-PrTES materials, Ni2+ exchanged ZSM-5-PrTES was found to exhibit the highest sensing ability (Linear range 100 μM34 mM, limit of detection 10 μM, and current sensitivity 22.1 μA/mM) but Cu2+ exchanged nanocrystalline ZSM-5 exhibited the highest current sensitivity for glucose oxidation (Linear range 100 μM12 mM, limit of detection 8 μM, and current sensitivity 59.85 μA/mM) (
Fig. 2
b,
Table 6
). The sensor was successfully applied to determine glucose concentration in the human blood serum.
It may be noted that it is difficult to prepare transition metal framework substituted mesoporous zeolites because of two reasons: (a) the difference in the hydrolysis rate of the metal precursor and silica precursor and (b) the difference in the ionic radius of metal and Si. Therefore, only a few transition metals can be substituted in the zeolite framework structure
[87]
. Electrocatalytic determination using zirconium/titanium framework substituted zeolites (zirconosilicates (Zr-ZSM-5-PrTES)/titanosilicates (Ti-ZSM-5-PrTES)) were investigated
[88]
,
[89]
. Zr-ZSM-5-PrTES based electrochemical sensors were developed for the simultaneous determination of vitamins (riboflavin (RB), rutin (RU), and pyridoxine (PY)) and environmental pollutants aminophenol isomers (p-aminophenol (p-AP), o-aminophenol (o-AP) and m-aminophenol (m-AP)) (
Table 6
). The results demonstrated that Zr-ZSM-5-PrTES exhibited significantly higher electrocatalytic activity when compared to Zr-ZSM-5 with a good stability, sensitivity and selectivity. High electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and sensitivity promote Zr-ZSM-5-PrTES to be an effective sensor for the simultaneous determination of vitamins and aminophenol isomers. The analytical performances of these sensors were demonstrated in the determination of vitamins in multivitamin tablets and aminophenol isomers in different environmental water bodies with high accuracy and satisfactory recovery.
As discussed above, redox active metals can be ion-exchanged or framework substituted in zeolites. However, using this method, only a limited amount of metals can be incorporated in the zeolite matrix. Furthermore, the redox properties of these metals are not tuneable because metals are incorporated in the zeolite framework. Mesoporous zeolites can act as an excellent support material due to their large external surface area, porosity, and surface Si-OH groups. Therefore, highly dispersed metal/metal oxide nanoparticles were supported on the mesoporous zeolites. It may be noted that the metal/metal oxides supported on mesoporous zeolites retain their individual characteristics. Mesoporous zeolites facilitate the high dispersion of the metal/metal oxide nanoparticles. Due to the high dispersion and small size of the metal/metal oxide particles supported on zeolite, the activity of the metal/metal oxide was significantly enhanced when compared to the bulk metal oxides. Ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA), and tryptophan (TyP) usually coexist in the blood serum. Therefore, the development of a sensitive and selective method for their simultaneous determination is highly desirable for analytical application and diagnostic research. AA showed very less anodic current response during the simultaneous determination of these biomolecules at various modified electrodes
[90]
. Furthermore, somewhat merged voltammeteric response were observed for DA and UA at several modified electrodes
[89]
,
[90]
. Therefore, it was highly desired to develop electrode materials, which can show highly distinct voltammeteric responses with high sensitivity and low detection limit. NiCo2O4/ZSM-5-PrTES was investigated in the simultaneous electrochemical determination of AA, DA, UA, and TrP (
Table 6
)
[91]
. The analytical performance of the developed sensor was demonstrated in the determination of AA and DA in the commercial pharmaceutical preparations (vitamin C tablets and dopamine injections) and uric acid in human urine samples. ZrO2 supported ZSM-5-PrTES was found to be successful as an electrochemical sensor for the determination of environmental pollutants metol and bisphenol A (
Table 6
)
[92]
. The analytical performance of the developed sensor was demonstrated with satisfactory results in different real samples, such as, the determination of metol in photographic solution, bisphenol A in baby bottle, and both metol and bisphenol A in river water. Furthermore, electrochemical sensor based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles supported on silver ion-exchanged zeolite modified glassy carbon electrode (HAP/Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE) was fabricated for the detection of ultra-trace (<1 ppb) amount of toxic heavy metal ions Cd (II), Pb (II), As (III) and Hg (II) (
Table 6
)
[93]
. The analytical application of the developed sensor was shown in the determination of heavy metal ions found in different water bodies. Hydroxyapatite supported nanocrystalline ZSM-5 based electrochemical sensor exhibited comparable or higher electrocatalytic activity when compared to the electrochemical sensors reported in the literature.
Surface Si-OH groups of mesoporous zeolites can be used to functionalize organic groups. These organic functionalities serve as capping agents to incorporate metal nanoparticles on zeolite surface. Highly dispersed gold nanoparticles were supported on mesoporous zeolite using aminopropyl functionalization (
Scheme 6
)
[94]
. The gold nanoparticles decorated ZSM-5-PrTES was then investigated in the electrochemical detection of cysteine and glutathione with high electrocatalytic activity, sensitivity, selectivity, and remarkably low detection limit (
Table 6
)
[94]
. Analytical performance of the developed sensor was demonstrated in the determination of cysteine and glutathione in the commercial pharmaceutical preparations with satisfactory results even in the presence of several amino acids.

To enhance the conductivity of zeolites, conductive materials (ionic liquids/polyaniline) were incorporated in zeolites in order to make the zeolites applicable for selected electrocatalytic applications. Ionic liquids were coated on the surface of ZSM-5-PrTES by post-synthesis method
[95]
. Polyaniline-ZSM-5-PrTES hybrid material was synthesized by the oxidative polymerization of aniline with ammonium peroxydisulfate in an aqueous zeolite suspension by the in-situ polymerization method
[95]
. Due to the large surface area and large number of surface silanol groups present on the external surface of mesoporous zeolite, substantial amount of ionic liquids/polyaniline were incorporated in the zeolite matrix. In order to introduce redox activity, transition metals were either ion-exchanged or supported as metal nanoparticles in nanocomposite materials. Ionic liquids coated ZSM-5-PrTES modified electrodes were constructed for the simultaneous determination of all four DNA bases (adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T))
[95]
. Methyl imidazolium chloride modified zeolite, MIM/ZSM-5-PrTES, exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of all four DNA bases (
Table 6
). The analytical performance of the proposed method was demonstrated in the simultaneous determination of all four DNA bases in calf thymus DNA sample. Under the optimum condition, the proposed method was applied for the determination of G, A, T, and C in a thermally denatured calf thymus DNA sample. The concentrations of G, A, T, and C in the HCl digested calf thymus DNA sample were found to be 21.6, 26.6, 27.7, and 24.0 (mol%), respectively, and the value of (G + C)/(A + T) for calf thymus DNA sample was obtained to be 0.84, which was very close to the reported value (0.77)
[96]
. Again, standard addition method was used to test the recovery. This was established by adding a known amount of DNA base to the HCl digested calf thymus DNA sample. The recoveries were in the range of 98103% demonstrating good accuracy and reliability of this method. Transition metal ion-exchanged polyaniline-zeolite (where transition metal = Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+) were investigated in the simultaneous determination of epinephrine (EP), paracetamol (PCM), and folic acid (FA)
[97]
. Cu2+ exchanged polyaniline-mesoporous ZSM-5 nanocomposite (Cu-PANI/ZSM-5-PrTES) exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity for epinephrine, paracetamol, and folic acid among the various transition metal-ion exchanged polyaniline-mesoporous ZSM-5 materials (Linear range 10 nM600 μM, 15 nM800 μM, 13 nM700 μM and limit of detection 4 nM, 8 nM, 5 nM for epinephrine, paracetamol, and folic acid, respectively) (
Fig. 2
c,
Table 6
). The analytical performance of the developed sensor was extended in the determination of epinephrine, paracetamol, and folic acid in various pharmaceutical preparations. Metal nanoparticles (silver and copper) supported polyaniline-mesoporous zeolite nanocomposite materials were investigated in the electrochemical determination of environmental pollutants lindane, hydrazine, and phenyl hydrazine
[98]
,
[99]
. While, silver nanoparticles decorated polyaniline-mesoporous ZSM-5 nanocomposite (Ag/ZSM-5-PrTES) exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity in lindane detection (
Table 6
), copper nanoparticles supported polyaniline-mesoporous ZSM-5 (Cu/ZSM-5-PrTES) exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity in the electrochemical detection of hydrazine and phenyl hydrazine (
Table 6
). The analytical performances of the developed sensors were demonstrated for the determination of lindane, hydrazine and phenyl hydrazine in different water bodies with satisfactory results.
Mesoporous zeolite based nanocomposite materials were also investigated as electrochemical biosensors. Biocompatible mesoporous ZSM-5 was used for the immobilization of enzymes. An acetylcholinesterase immobilized polyaniline-zeolite (ACH-PANI/ZSM-5-PrTES) based electrochemical biosensor was developed for the detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the resultant biosensor was further employed for the detection of toxic organophosphate pesticides monocrotopos and dichlorvos (
Table 6
)
[100]
. Later, an excellent electrochemical biosensor based on nanocrystalline titanosilicate was fabricated by the covalent immobilization of enzyme acetylcholinesterase for the ultra-trace detection of toxic organophosphate pesticides such as malathion, parathion methyl, monocrotopos, and dichlorvos (
Table 6
)
[101]
. The fabrication of this biosensor and its detection mechanism are summarized in
Scheme 7
. The analytical performance of the developed biosensors was demonstrated in the determination of these pesticides in different real samples (apple, cabbage, tap water, and river water) with satisfactory recovery. The titanosilicate based biosensor exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity when compared to the polyaniline-zeolite based electrochemical biosensor because of the covalent immobilization of enzyme and framework substituted titanium (that can act as redox mediator).

3.3. Usefulness of mesoporous zeolite in methanol fuel cell application
Microporous zeolites are inactive for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. Metal complex (Ni and Co Salen complex, Salen: N, N bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine) encapsulated microporous zeolites have been investigated for the electocatalytic oxidation of methanol in aqueous NaOH solution
[102]
,
[103]
. With the development of mesoporous zeolites, efforts have been made to develop modified electrodes for methanol oxidation. M2+-ZSM-5-PrTES samples were investigated for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol in alkaline medium
[86]
. Detailed investigations were made using Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES due to its high activity. Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES modified electrode produced Ni(OH)2 species which was converted to the species NiOOH during the potential sweep, which subsequently oxidized methanol to produce anodic current. Carbon dioxide was formed as the final product during the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol at Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES modified electrode. It was produced via an overall four-electron process as indicated below, producing formate anion as an intermediate.
α-Ni(OH)2 + OH  NiOOH + H2O + e
NiOOH + CH3OH  β-Ni(OH)2 + Product
β-Ni(OH)2 + OH  NiOOH + H2O + e
CH3OH + 5OH  HCOO + 4H2O + 4e
Ni2+-ZSM-5 modified electrode exhibited a similar CV to that of Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES modified electrode, but with a low current response. The improved performance of Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES originated from the synergistic action of intercrystalline mesopores and high surface area, which facilitated the electron transfer rate. It may be noted that the external surface area of Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES was about five times higher than that of Ni2+-ZSM-5. The large external surface enhanced the diffusion of the reactant and product molecules and also provided highly dispersed Ni2+ active centres for the electocatalytic reaction. As a result of the high surface area and highly dispersed Ni2+ in Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES, reactants were easily accessible to the catalytically active sites, which in turn enhanced the reaction rate for the electrocatalytic oxidation. The current sensitivities for the modified electrodes were found to be 20, 49.91, 0, 4573, and 1321 μA M1 for Mn2+-ZSM-5-PrTES, Fe2+-ZSM-5-PrTES, Co2+-ZSM-5-PrTES, Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES, and Cu2+-ZSM-5-PrTES, respectively. Based on the experimental evidence, one can conclude that Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES exhibited superior current sensitivity and sensing ability as compared to the other M2+-ZSM-5-PrTES modified electrodes.
CeO2 supported mesoporous ZSM-5 (CeO2/ZSM-5-PrTES) was investigated in the methanol oxidation for its possible application in methanol fuel cell
[104]
. The results demonstrated that CeO2/ZSM-5-PrTES (weight ratio 30%) exhibited 16 times higher current density when compared to the individual nanocrystalline CeO2 (
Table 7
). The activity of CeO2-ZSM-5-PrTES was even higher than that of SnO2 supported mesoporous ZSM-5
[105]
. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of CeO2/ZSM-5-PrTES can be attributed to the synergistic contribution provided by nanocrystalline CeO2 and acidic ZSM-5-PrTES. The large external surface area and the surface silanol groups were found to be favourable for the formation of a stable inter-connected catalytic phase and of a high dispersion of nanocrystalline CeO2 on the large external surface of ZSM-5-PrTES. Acidic sites present on ZSM-5-PrTES facilitated the adsorption of OH species (from supporting electrolyte) on its surface which then reacted with CeO2 to form Ce(OH)x)
[105]
,
[106]
,
[107]
. The Ce(OH)x species are believed to reversibly release OH and regenerate CeO2. In the case of cerium, the energy between 4f and 5d is almost same
[108]
. Therefore, the inter-conversion of oxidation states of cerium is facilitated by applying low potential energy
[108]
.

Proposed mechanism for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol at CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES is presented in
Scheme 8
. After the addition of methanol in the electrochemical cell, the methanol molecules were adsorbed onto the Brnsted acidic sites of ZSM-5-PrTES in the CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE. Then the Ce(OH)x formed at the electrode surface accelerated the dehydrogenation of the CH3OHads species in a stepwise manner to form COads species on the catalyst surface
[109]
. Ce(OH)x had the ability to convert CO to COOH with the help of adsorbed OH before it was finally liberated as CO2 (
Scheme 8
).

The stability of CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE was examined by recording repetitive CVs for 1000 scans in 0.5 M NaOH at a scan rate of 50 mV/s in the presence of 0.5 M methanol (
Fig. 3
). No significant decrease in the peak current density was observed after 1000 cycles (
Fig. 3
, inset), which confirmed that CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES was highly stable. The current density remained at above 96% even after being cycled 1000 times, indicating the stable electrocatalytic activity of CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES (
Fig. 3
). At the same time, the commercial catalyst Pt(20%)/C exhibited a large decrease in the current density and was only able to retain 9% of its original activity after 1000 cycles. This loss in the electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the CO poisoning of the Pt surface, which forms as an inhibiting intermediate during the electrochemical oxidation of methanol.

On the basis of the results obtained and the proposed mechanism, the following conclusions were derived for the excellent activity of CeO2-ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE in methanol oxidation. (1) The calcination method was favourable for the high dispersion of active nanocrystalline CeO2 on the large external surface of ZSM-5-PrTES, (2) The calcination procedure provided an active interface between the support (ZSM-5-PrTES) and catalytically active CeO2 species. This was important to form the catalytically active Ce(OH)x species and the CH3OHads species in close proximity for an efficient electrochemical oxidation of methanol at the interface. (3) The synergistic contribution provided by the catalytically active nanocrystalline CeO2 and the Brnsted acidic sites of ZSM-5-PrTES significantly increased the electrocatalytic activity of CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE. (4) The fast electrode kinetics, the low overpotential, and the favourable textural properties (large surface area and intercrystalline mesopores) facilitated the diffusion of methanol to and from the electrode surface of CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE were additional factors which enhanced the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The excellent current density and high stability of CeO2(30%)/ZSM-5-PrTES/GCE suggest that this material can be considered as a suitable candidate for the commercial direct methanol fuel cell.
3.4. Biomedical applications of mesoporous zeolites
Biochemical processes are closely related to the various zeolite properties (ion-exchange, adsorption, and catalysis) and, therefore, synthetic zeolites have the ability to play significant roles towards the advancements in the fields of biology, medicine, and the pharmaceutical industry. Toxicological studies have shown that the zeolite clinoptilolite is non-toxic and a safe material for human consumption
[110]
. Metal-exchanged zeolites are known for the controlled release of agents against microbial pollution
[111]
. Zeolites containing copper ions exhibited good antibacterial activity for both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria
[112]
. The degree of zeolite hydrophilicity can be controlled by adjusting the Si/Al ratio of the framework. Thus zeolites appear to be ideally suited for both enhancing the dissolution and controlling the release of various drug molecules. A detailed study on a combination of experiment and theory has been used to assess the potential use of the zeolites Beta and Y as a drug delivery agent
[113]
,
[114]
. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) was loaded on zeolite A and Y. Both of the zeolites individually revealed no toxicity towards the HCT-15 cancer cells. CHC encapsulated zeolite exhibited an inhibition of cell viability up to 585-fold, when compared to the non-encapsulated drug. These results indicate the potential of the zeolites for drug loading and delivery into cancer cells to induce cell death
[115]
.
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is an important inorganic material that provides strength to the hard tissues of bone and teeth. Therefore, artificial HAP is widely used in the fields of orthopaedic and dentistry owing to its excellent biocompatibility with the human tissues
[116]
,
[117]
. However, artificial HAP exhibits poor tensile strength and fracture toughness, which limits its application in bone-tissue engineering. To overcome these limitations, it is important to prepare HAP-based nanocomposite materials, which shall provide better tensile strength and fracture toughness. In general, these nanocomposite materials are used to replace damaged or missed bone tissues
[118]
,
[119]
. It may be noted that synthetic HAP is a biocompatible material that can be strongly bonded to the bone and thus promote the formation of bone tissue on its surface
[120]
. HAP was grown in zeolite matrix by incubating the silver ion-exchanged ZSM-5-PrTES in simulated body fluid at 310 K
[121]
. Physicochemical characterizations revealed that a large amount of hydroxyapatite ( 8 wt%) with nanosheet morphology was grown in Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES matrix when it was incubated in simulated body fluid for 20 days. Investigations revealed that silver ions present in ZSM-5-PrTES triggered the growth of hydroxyapatite. This investigation showed that the Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES and HAP grown Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES were both biocompatible and exhibited 100% cell viability for the mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages and the human Caco2 cell lines. The compression test results of Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES and Ag-ZSM-5 are shown in
Fig. 4
. The mean values of compressive modulus (2  0.03 vs 0.2  0.05 G), compressive strength (61.7  1.02 vs 6.5  0.09 MPa), and strain at failure (3.0 and 3.1) for Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES and Ag-ZSM-5 showed that the compressive strength and compressive modulus of Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES were much higher than that of Ag-ZSM-5. However, in the case of Ag-ZSM-5, the strain of failure was somewhat higher than Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES. Higher compressive strength in Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES can be correlated to inter/intra-crystalline mesoporosity, which provides more dense packing of zeolite crystals compared to Ag-ZSM-5 in a similar specimen. The mechanical properties of Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES were comparable to cancellous bone, and natural (heated bovine cancellous bone) and synthetic (freeze-casted) hydroxyapatite
[122]
. Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES was presumably strong enough to resist handling related damages during implantation and loading. Therefore, Ag-ZSM-5-PrTES can be used as a bone-implant material because its porous structure permits the growth of bone matrixes and the transport of body fluids.

4. Conclusions and future prospects
In this review, strategies for the synthesis of zeolites having inter-/intra-crystalline mesopores have been presented. Various top-down approaches such as dealumination, desilication, desilication followed by surfactant assisted zeolite crystallization show that commercial zeolites can be converted to mesoporous zeolites having disordered mesopores and non-homogenous distribution of acid sites. In order to overcome these limitations, several bottom-up approaches have emerged. Most of these bottom-up approaches involve the use of templates (hard/soft). For the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites, mesoporous carbon is a preferred hard template. However, using this strategy, only a small scale synthesis can be performed. Due to the small scale synthesis and the high cost involved in the preparation of hard template, this may not be a sustainable synthetic approach from the industrial perspective. A wide range of additives and soft templates, such as multi-cationic surfactants, silylated surfactants or polymers, and cationic polymers have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites with different framework structures. The study shows that a suitable surfactant is required for the synthesis of a specific zeolite framework structure. Most of these surfactants produced materials with disordered mesoporous structure. Using suitable types of multi-cationic surfactants under an optimum synthetic condition one can produce mesoporous zeolites having an order in the low-angle length scale as well as in the wide angle-length scale. Finally, a few synthesis strategies have emerged by which it is possible to synthesize mesoporous zeolites of different framework structure using one mesopore directing soft template.
Mesoporous zeolite exhibited significantly higher catalytic activities in various acid-catalyzed reactions involving large organic molecules where conventional zeolites were found to be either inactive or exhibited very low activity. Tuneable physicochemical properties of mesoporous zeolites such as ion-exchange property, framework metal substitution, surface functionalization ability, large external surface area, and inter-crystalline mesoporosity were required to develop the suitable electrode materials towards the chosen electrochemical applications. Non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors based on mesoporous zeolites were fabricated for the detection of bio-molecules and water pollutants (organic and inorganic metals). The surface functionalization ability was used to develop enzymatic electrochemical sensors for organophosphates. The proposed methodology was simple and rapid. It provides a potentially new analytical platform for the detection of biomolecules in the fields of clinical investigations and quality control (in the pharmaceutical industry) and also for sensing various environmental pollutants present in the water bodies. The zeolite- based biosensors can further be extended to different enzymes and antibodies and hence can be considered as a promising candidate for the construction of important biosensors. The applicability of nanocrystalline zeolite-based materials was extended in the methanol oxidation for their possible use in the direct methanol fuel cell. Moreover, the applicability of these materials was also extended in the field of biomedical engineering such as bone-implant materials. High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance.
Although the use of zeolites makes the catalytic process eco-friendly and recyclable, the synthesis of mesoporous directing agents required for the preparation of mesoporous zeolites is not eco-friendly. The major limitation associated with multi-cationic mesopore directors is that they need to be synthesized using multi-step organic synthesis route. This discourages its industrial scope for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolites. Therefore, it is important to develop synthetic strategies for the preparation of zeolites that shall utilize eco-friendly, economical, and abundantly available commercial templates. Furthermore, with the development of mesoporous zeolite, the application domain can be extended beyond the petrochemical/fine chemical industry so that zeolites can find their applications as sensors, as energy materials, and in healthcare products. These applications certainly make zeolites as the materials for mankind from the standpoint of sustainable modern technology.
