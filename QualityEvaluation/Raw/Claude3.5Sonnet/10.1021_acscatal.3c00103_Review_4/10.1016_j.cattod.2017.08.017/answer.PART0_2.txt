[1] "Diffusion limitation imposed by the intricate microporous network structure has created interest in the scientists to prepare materials which has mesopores in the length scale of 220 nm."

[2] "Improvement in the diffusion process due to the generation of disordered mesopores leads to improve the catalytic activity."

[3] "Mesoporous zeolites could play an important role in various inter-disciplinary research areas because of their enhanced textural properties, compared to the conventional micron-sized zeolites. Small particle size and mesoporosity present in these materials decrease the diffusion path length and provide readily accessible active sites in the fine chemical synthesis involving large molecules."

[4] "High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Diffusion limitations: Conventional microporous zeolites have intricate network structures that limit diffusion of reactants and products. Introducing mesopores in the 2-20 nm range improves diffusion processes and enhances catalytic activity.

2. Particle size: Smaller particle sizes decrease diffusion path lengths, providing more readily accessible active sites for reactions involving large molecules.

3. Surface area: Mesoporous zeolites have enhanced textural properties compared to conventional micron-sized zeolites, including higher surface areas. This allows for better dispersion of active sites and improved catalytic performance.

4. Pore structure: The presence of intercrystalline mesopores facilitates enhanced diffusion of reactant and product molecules, contributing to higher catalytic activity.

5. Active site dispersion: Mesoporous structures allow for high dispersion of metal active centers throughout the porous zeolite network, increasing the number of accessible catalytic sites.

6. Electron transfer: The porous structure enables facile transportation of electrons in electrochemical processes and reduces electron transfer resistance.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Introducing mesoporosity: This can be done through various methods such as templating or post-synthesis treatments to create additional pores in the 2-20 nm range.

2. Controlling particle size: Synthesis methods can be adjusted to produce smaller zeolite particles with shorter diffusion path lengths.

3. Increasing surface area: Techniques to enhance the overall surface area of the catalyst support can improve active site dispersion and accessibility.

4. Tailoring pore structure: Methods to create well-connected pore networks combining micropores and mesopores can optimize diffusion properties.

5. Enhancing active site dispersion: Techniques to ensure uniform distribution of active metal centers throughout the porous structure can maximize catalytic efficiency.

6. Improving electron transfer: Modifications to enhance the conductive properties of the support material can facilitate better electron transport in electrochemical applications.

By carefully optimizing these physicochemical properties through various support modification strategies, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of zeolite-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions can be significantly enhanced.
