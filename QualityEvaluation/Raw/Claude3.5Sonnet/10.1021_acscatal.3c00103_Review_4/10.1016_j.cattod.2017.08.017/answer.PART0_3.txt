[1] "Microporous zeolites are unique with respect to molecular sieving and shape/size selectivity but this is a limiting factor in the fine chemical industries or even in the petrochemical industries involving large organic molecules. The small size of the channels (less than 8 Å) and cavities (typically <15 Å) imposes diffusion constraints on reactions involving large organic molecules and exhibits high back pressure on the flow systems"

[2] "Mesoporous zeolites exhibited higher catalytic activity in various acid catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity. Activities of mesoporous zeolites are similar to that of the conventional zeolites in the reactions involving small molecules. Moreover, mesoporous zeolites exhibited significant retardation in the catalyst deactivation in vapour phase and liquid phase reactions when compared with conventional zeolites."

[3] "High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Chemical qualities: 
- Acid strength and stability are crucial for catalytic activity. Mesoporous zeolites exhibit higher catalytic activity in acid-catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity.
- The presence of metal active centers dispersed in the porous zeolite network enhances catalytic efficiency.

2. Morphological characteristics:
- Pore size and structure are critical. Conventional microporous zeolites have limitations due to small channel sizes, which impose diffusion constraints for large organic molecules.
- Mesoporous zeolites overcome this limitation, allowing enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules.
- High surface area of mesoporous zeolites contributes to improved catalytic performance.

3. Support modification strategies:
- Creating intercrystalline mesopores in zeolites enhances diffusion and reduces mass transfer limitations.
- Increasing the external surface area of zeolites improves accessibility to active sites.
- Dispersing metal active centers throughout the porous network structure optimizes catalytic efficiency.
- Developing nanocomposite materials based on zeolites can further enhance catalytic properties.

These modifications result in enhanced catalytic efficiency, improved selectivity, and reduced catalyst deactivation in both vapor phase and liquid phase reactions. The optimized physicochemical properties facilitate better molecular transport, increased accessibility to active sites, and improved electron transfer, all contributing to superior catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 化学性质：
- 酸强度和稳定性对催化活性至关重要。介孔沸石在需要中等到强酸性的酸催化反应中表现出更高的催化活性。
- 分散在多孔沸石网络结构中的金属活性中心的存在可以提高催化效率。

2. 形态特征：
- 孔径和结构至关重要。传统的微孔沸石由于通道尺寸小，对大型有机分子存在扩散限制。
- 介孔沸石克服了这一限制，允许反应物/产物分子更好地扩散。
- 介孔沸石的高比表面积有助于提高催化性能。

3. 载体改性策略：
- 在沸石中创建晶间介孔可以增强扩散并减少传质限制。
- 增加沸石的外表面积可以提高活性位点的可及性。
- 将金属活性中心分散在整个多孔网络结构中可以优化催化效率。
- 开发基于沸石的纳米复合材料可以进一步增强催化性能。

这些改进导致催化效率的提高、选择性的改善，以及在气相和液相反应中催化剂失活的减少。优化的物理化学性质促进了更好的分子传输、增加了活性位点的可及性，并改善了电子转移，所有这些都有助于在脱氢反应中实现更优越的催化性能。
