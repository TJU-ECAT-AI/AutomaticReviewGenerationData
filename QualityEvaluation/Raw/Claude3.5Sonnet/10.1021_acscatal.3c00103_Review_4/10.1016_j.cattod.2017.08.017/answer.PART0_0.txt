[1] "Mesoporous zeolites exhibited significantly higher catalytic activities in various acid-catalyzed reactions involving large organic molecules where conventional zeolites were found to be either inactive or exhibited very low activity."

[2] "Tuneable physicochemical properties of mesoporous zeolites such as ion-exchange property, framework metal substitution, surface functionalization ability, large external surface area, and inter-crystalline mesoporosity were required to develop the suitable electrode materials towards the chosen electrochemical applications."

[3] "High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Key properties include:

1. Acid strength and stability: Mesoporous zeolites exhibit higher catalytic activity in acid-catalyzed reactions compared to conventional zeolites, especially for large organic molecules.

2. Morphological characteristics: Large external surface area and inter-crystalline mesoporosity enhance diffusion of reactants and products, improving catalytic efficiency.

3. Ion-exchange properties and framework metal substitution: These allow for tuning of the catalyst's properties to suit specific reactions.

4. Surface functionalization ability: This enables modification of the catalyst surface for improved selectivity or activity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties include:

1. Creating mesopores in zeolites to enhance diffusion and accessibility of active sites.

2. Framework metal substitution to tune the electronic properties and acidity of the catalyst.

3. Surface functionalization to alter the catalyst's selectivity or affinity for certain reactants.

4. Dispersing metal active centers throughout the porous zeolite network to increase the number of available catalytic sites.

These strategies can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by improving mass transfer, increasing the number of accessible active sites, and tuning the electronic and chemical properties of the catalyst.
