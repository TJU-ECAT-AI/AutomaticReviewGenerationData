[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. 

Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability affect the selectivity towards the targeted alkene. Proper acidity is crucial for C-H activation and propylene desorption, but excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like C-C cracking and deep dehydrogenation. 

Morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products. The diffusion efficiency is determined by the catalyst's morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Acidity Adjustment: Introducing alkali or alkaline-earth metals can balance the strong acidity of supports like Al2O3, inhibiting catalytic deactivation.

2. Morphology Regulation: Developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies (e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, mesh-shaped) and high external surfaces can shorten diffusion paths and reduce diffusion resistance.

3. Porosity Regulation: Creating hierarchical structures with both micro and meso-level porosity can combine the benefits of microporous and mesoporous zeolites, providing fast transport and high hydrothermal stability.

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between acidity and diffusion efficiency, leading to improved catalyst performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。

化学性质如酸强度和稳定性影响了对目标烯烃的选择性。适当的�idity对C-H活化和丙烯脱附至关重要，但过度的酸性可能导致不期望的副反应，如C-C断裂和深度脱氢。

形态和多孔性质影响反应物和产物的扩散效率。扩散效率由催化剂的形态、结构、尺寸和化学性质决定。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种支撑体修饰策略：

1. 酸度调节：引入碱金属或碱土金属可以平衡Al2O3等支撑体的强酸性，抑制催化剂失活。

2. 形态调控：开发纳米级支撑体和合成具有特定形态（如针状、片状、网状）和高外表面积的支撑体，可以缩短扩散路径并降低扩散阻力。

3. 孔隙度调控：创建具有微观和介观层次孔隙度的分级结构，可以结合微孔和介孔沸石的优点，提供快速传输和高水热稳定性。

这些策略旨在优化酸度和扩散效率之间的平衡，从而提高催化剂在脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
