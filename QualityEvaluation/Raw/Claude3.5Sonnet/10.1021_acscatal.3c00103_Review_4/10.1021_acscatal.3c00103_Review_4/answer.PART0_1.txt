[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The acid strength and stability affect the selectivity towards the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous qualities impact diffusion efficiency.

Chemical properties, particularly acidity, play a crucial role in catalyst performance. Proper acidity is essential for CH activation and propylene desorption. However, excessive acidity can lead to undesirable side reactions such as CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation, negatively impacting the dehydrogenation process.

Morphological characteristics of the catalyst support, including structure, size, and shape, determine the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products. This is a critical kinetic factor for heterogeneous catalysts.

To optimize these properties and enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Acidity Adjustment: This involves balancing the acidity of the support to achieve optimal performance. Techniques include introducing alkali or alkaline-earth metals to reduce strong acidity, dealumination to reduce Brønsted acid sites, and ion-exchange methods.

2. Morphology Regulation: Developing supports with specific morphologies like nanosized, needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, or mesh-shaped structures can shorten diffusion paths and reduce diffusion resistance.

3. Porosity Regulation: Creating hierarchical structures with both micro and meso-level porosity can combine the benefits of fast transport and high hydrothermal stability. This can be achieved through top-down methods (post-treatment procedures) or bottom-up methods (using templates as mesoporogens).

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability by tailoring the physicochemical properties of the catalyst support to suit the specific requirements of dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。酸强度和稳定性影响目标烯烃的选择性，而形态和孔隙特性则影响扩散效率。

化学性质，特别是酸性，在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。适当的酸性对CH活化和丙烯脱附至关重要。然而，过度的酸性可能导致不良的副反应，如CC断裂和深度脱氢，对脱氢过程产生负面影响。

催化剂载体的形态特征，包括结构、尺寸和形状，决定了反应物和产物的扩散效率。这是异相催化剂的一个关键动力学因素。

为了优化这些性质并提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种载体改性策略：

1. 酸度调节：这涉及平衡载体的酸度以实现最佳性能。技术包括引入碱金属或碱土金属以降低强酸性，脱铝以减少Brønsted酸位点，以及离子交换方法。

2. 形态调控：开发具有特定形态的载体，如纳米尺寸、针状、片状或网状结构，可以缩短扩散路径并降低扩散阻力。

3. 孔隙度调控：创建具有微观和介观级孔隙度的分层结构，可以结合快速传输和高水热稳定性的优点。这可以通过自上而下的方法（后处理程序）或自下而上的方法（使用模板作为介孔成因剂）来实现。

这些策略旨在通过定制催化剂载体的物理化学性质，以适应脱氢反应的特定要求，从而优化催化活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡。
