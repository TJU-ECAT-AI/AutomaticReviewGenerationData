[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

[2] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

[4] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. 

Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability affect the selectivity towards the targeted alkene. Proper acidity of the support is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption, while excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation.

Morphological and porous qualities influence the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products. The diffusion efficiency is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Acidity adjustment: This involves regulating the acid properties of the catalyst support to improve catalytic stability and selectivity toward propylene.

2. Morphology regulation: Developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies (e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures) to shorten diffusion paths and reduce diffusion resistance.

3. Porosity regulation: Creating hierarchical structures with secondary porosity at micro and meso levels to combine fast transport and high hydrothermal stability.

These strategies aim to balance the acid properties, improve mass transport, and enhance the accessibility of active sites, ultimately leading to better catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，对其在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。

化学性质如酸强度和稳定性影响目标烯烃的选择性。支持物的适当酸度对CH活化和丙烯脱附至关重要，而过度的酸度可能导致不希望的副反应，如CC断裂和深度脱氢。

形态和孔隙特性影响反应物和产物的扩散效率。扩散效率由支持物的形态、结构、大小和化学性质决定。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用以下几种支持物改性策略：

1. 酸度调节：调节催化剂支持物的酸性质，以提高催化稳定性和对丙烯的选择性。

2. 形态调控：开发纳米尺寸的支持物和合成特定形态（如针状、片状和网状结构）的支持物，以缩短扩散路径和减少扩散阻力。

3. 孔隙调控：创建在微观和介观水平上具有次级孔隙度的分级结构，结合快速传输和高水热稳定性。

这些策略旨在平衡酸性质、改善质量传输和提高活性位点的可及性，最终在脱氢反应中实现更好的催化性能。
