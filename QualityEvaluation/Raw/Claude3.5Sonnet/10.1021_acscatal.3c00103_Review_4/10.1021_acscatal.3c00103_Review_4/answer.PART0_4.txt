[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

[2] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

[4] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability affect the selectivity towards the targeted alkene. Proper acidity is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption, while excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation.

Morphological and porous qualities of the catalyst support influence the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products. This is a critical kinetic factor in heterogeneous catalysis. The diffusion efficiency is determined by the support's morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Acidity adjustment: This involves balancing the acidity of the support to achieve optimal selectivity and stability. Methods include introducing alkali or alkaline-earth metals to reduce strong acidity, dealumination of zeolites, and ion-exchange methods.

2. Morphology regulation: This focuses on shortening diffusion paths or reducing diffusion resistance. Strategies include developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies (e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures) to increase external surface area and improve mass transport.

3. Porosity regulation: This involves creating hierarchical structures with both micro- and mesoporosity. Hierarchical zeolites, for example, combine fast transport properties with high hydrothermal stability. These can be synthesized through top-down methods (post-treatment procedures) or bottom-up methods (using templates as mesoporogens).

These strategies aim to optimize the balance between catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability by tailoring the support's physicochemical properties to enhance diffusion efficiency, provide appropriate acidity, and maintain structural integrity under reaction conditions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学性质如酸强度和稳定性影响了对目标烯烃的选择性。适当的酸度对CH活化和丙烯脱附至关重要，而过度的酸度可能导致不需要的副反应，如CC裂解和深度脱氢。

催化剂支持体的形态和多孔性质影响反应物和产物的扩散效率。这是异相催化中的一个关键动力学因素。扩散效率由支持体的形态、结构、尺寸和化学性质决定。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种支持体改性策略：

1. 酸度调节：这涉及平衡支持体的酸度以达到最佳的选择性和稳定性。方法包括引入碱金属或碱土金属以减少强酸性，沸石的脱铝，以及离子交换方法。

2. 形态调控：这主要集中在缩短扩散路径或减少扩散阻力。策略包括开发纳米级支持体和合成具有特定形态（如针状、片状和网状结构）的支持体，以增加外部表面积并改善物质传输。

3. 孔隙度调节：这涉及创建具有微孔和介孔的层次结构。例如，分级沸石结合了快速传输特性和高水热稳定性。这些可以通过自上而下的方法（后处理程序）或自下而上的方法（使用模板作为介孔形成剂）合成。

这些策略旨在通过调整支持体的物理化学性质来优化催化活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡，以增强扩散效率，提供适当的酸度，并在反应条件下维持结构完整性。
