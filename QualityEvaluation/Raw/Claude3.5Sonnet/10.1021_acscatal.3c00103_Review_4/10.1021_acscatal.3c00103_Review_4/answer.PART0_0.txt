[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."

[2] "PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."

[3] "For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

[4] "Several strategies are proposed, focusing on shortening the diffusion path or diffusion resistance, including developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with particular morphologies and high external surfaces, e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions in several ways:

1. Acid strength and stability affect the selectivity towards the targeted alkene. Proper acidity is crucial for CH activation and propylene desorption, but excessive acidity can lead to undesired side reactions like CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation.

2. Morphological and porous qualities impact the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products. This is a key kinetic factor determined by the catalyst's morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties.

3. The hydrothermal and pH stability of the catalyst affect its overall performance and longevity in the reaction environment.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several support modification strategies can be employed:

1. Acidity adjustment: This can involve introducing alkali or alkaline-earth metals to balance strong acidity, or dealumination to reduce Brønsted acid sites in zeolites.

2. Morphology regulation: Developing nanosized supports or synthesizing supports with specific shapes (e.g., needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, mesh-shaped) can shorten diffusion paths and reduce diffusion resistance.

3. Porosity regulation: Creating hierarchical structures with both micro and meso-level porosity can combine the benefits of fast transport and high hydrothermal stability.

4. Using mesoporous materials: Supports like mesoporous SiO2 and Al2O3 can provide excellent hydrothermal stability and large surface areas.

5. Designing zeolites with particular morphologies: This includes creating nanosized zeolites or zeolites with unique structures like "finned" zeolites to enhance mass transport properties.

These strategies aim to balance various factors such as acidity, diffusion efficiency, stability, and active site accessibility to achieve optimal catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特征，通过以下几种方式显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能：

1. 酸强度和稳定性影响目标烯烃的选择性。适当的酸度对CH活化和丙烯脱附至关重要，但过度的酸度可能导致不希望的副反应，如CC断裂和深度脱氢。

2. 形态和多孔性质影响反应物和产物的扩散效率。这是由催化剂的形态、结构、尺寸和化学性质决定的关键动力学因素。

3. 催化剂的水热和pH稳定性影响其在反应环境中的整体性能和寿命。

为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用几种支持体改性策略：

1. 酸度调节：这可以包括引入碱金属或碱土金属来平衡强酸性，或对沸石进行脱铝以减少Brønsted酸位。

2. 形态调控：开发纳米尺寸的支持体或合成特定形状（如针状、片状、网状）的支持体可以缩短扩散路径并降低扩散阻力。

3. 孔隙度调节：创建具有微观和介观级孔隙度的层级结构可以结合快速传输和高水热稳定性的优势。

4. 使用介孔材料：如介孔SiO2和Al2O3等支持体可提供优异的水热稳定性和大表面积。

5. 设计特定形态的沸石：这包括创建纳米尺寸的沸石或具有独特结构的沸石，如"鳍状"沸石，以增强物质传输性能。

这些策略旨在平衡酸度、扩散效率、稳定性和活性位可及性等各种因素，以在脱氢反应中实现最佳的催化性能。
