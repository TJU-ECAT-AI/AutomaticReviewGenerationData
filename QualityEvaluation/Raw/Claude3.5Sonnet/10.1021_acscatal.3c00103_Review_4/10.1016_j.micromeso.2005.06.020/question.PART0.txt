I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
Recent access to measuring techniques covering the whole scale of diffusion phenomena relevant for heterogeneous catalysis demands reconsideration of the transport phenomena inherent to heterogeneous catalysis with respect to the options of their quantitation. With respect to the relevant diffusion paths the measuring techniques may be classified as microscopic and macroscopic and with respect to the thermodynamic regime as equilibrium techniques and non-equilibrium techniques. The PFG NMR method is presented as a particularly versatile technique, being able to reflect aspects of both microscopic and macroscopic observation. In addition to the direct measurement of the coefficients of intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion, it is as well able to provide information about deviations from normal diffusion such as, e.g., in the case of single-file diffusion, and about the existence of transport barriers. With diffusion studies of FCC catalysts an example of the practical application of PFG NMR, including its inherent limitations, is given.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do the physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions, and what support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
