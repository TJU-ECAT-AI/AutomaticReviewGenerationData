Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, or their influence on catalyst performance. The document focuses on N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using iron-containing MFI zeolites with different framework compositions. It does not discuss CO2-ODHP or Fe oxide catalysts supported on other materials. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的可还原性和载体材料,以及它们对催化剂性能的影响的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用具有不同骨架组成的铁含MFI沸石进行N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。它没有讨论CO2-ODHP或负载在其他材料上的Fe氧化物催化剂。因此,无法根据提供的文本回答这个问题。
