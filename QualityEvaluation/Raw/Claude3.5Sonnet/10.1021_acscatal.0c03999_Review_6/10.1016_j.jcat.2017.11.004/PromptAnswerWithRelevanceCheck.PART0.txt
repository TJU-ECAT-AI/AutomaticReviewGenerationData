Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, their reducibility, support materials, or performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The document focuses on molybdenum carbide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and does not discuss iron oxide catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given information.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献中不包含任何关于Fe氧化物基催化剂、它们的可还原性、载体材料或在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的信息。该文档主要讨论了用于丙烷脱氢的钼碳化物催化剂,并没有涉及铁氧化物催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。因此,无法根据给定的信息回答这个问题。
