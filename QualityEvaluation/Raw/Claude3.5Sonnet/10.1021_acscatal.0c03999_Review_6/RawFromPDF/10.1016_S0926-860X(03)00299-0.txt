Abstract
The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identiﬁed
by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter ∼4–5 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the
zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.5–1.5 m long and 0.1–0.2 m wide) of Ga2O3. Upon
calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter ∼4–5 nm), still at the outer surface of the
zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely. Reducing–oxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration
of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. The latter enhance the bifunctional
(dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modiﬁed zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears
that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.

1. Introduction
Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are proven good catalysts for
the aromatisation of light alkanes (C3 and C4) (i.e. the
CYCLAR process [1–3]). They are bifunctional cat-
alysts with gallium species promoting the activation
and dehydrogenation of the alkane and acid centres be-
ing responsible for the conjunct polymerisation reac-

tions leading eventually to aromatic compounds, light
branched alkanes, and hydrogen as products [4–6].
Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites [7] by
different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation us-
ing gallium salts in aqueous or organic media [5,8],
mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed
by thermal treatment [6], and by direct isomorphous
substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis [9,10]. The
method that is most applied is impregnation from
aqueous solutions followed by calcination and activa-
tion treatments.
The present contribution aims at providing addi-
tional information on the effect of such treatments on
the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5
catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance
for the aromatisation of propane.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The gallium-modiﬁed ZSM-5 catalyst, Ga/H-ZSM-
5, was prepared by ionic exchange. A 0.05 M
Ga(NO3)3 solution (Ga(NO3)3·6H2O, purity 99.9%,
Aldrich) was stirred with NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite (Ze-
olyst, Si/Al = 18, i.e. 5.05 Al per unit cell) using
10 cm3 of solution per gram of zeolite. The mixture
was reﬂuxed at 373 K for consecutive steps of 0.5 h
(pH 3). Samples obtained after one, two, four and
eight successive reﬂux steps, i.e. 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h
in total, were prepared and are designated below as
Ga/(0.5), Ga/(1), Ga/(2) and Ga/(4), respectively. Af-
ter each step of reﬂux, the solid was recovered by
ﬁltration and then dried at 423 K. The ﬁnal solid was
ﬁltered, washed with de-ionised water at ambient tem-
perature and subsequently dried at 293 K, calcined at
823 K, and eventually submitted, as desired, to H2–O2
treatments at 823 K (up to three successive cycles
comprising each 1 h under H2 and 1 h under O2).
2.2. Catalyst characterisation
The chemical state and location of the Ga species
were determined by several techniques, namely XRD,
FT-IR, HRTEM–EDX, XPS, MAS-NMR, N2 and
n-hexane adsorption, NH3-TPD, and H2-TPR. The
chemical compositions of the different samples were
determined by atomic adsorption at UMIST, UK.
XRD data were collected at ambient temperature
with a Philips PW 1050 X-ray diffractometer equipped
with a Hilten Brooks generator using the Co K radi-
ation. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were carried out
at 77 K, volumetrically, using a Micromeritics ASAP
2000 adsorption apparatus after degassing the sam-
ples (ca. 200 mg) at 623 K under a pressure of 1.3 ×
10−3 Pa. A Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermal analyser was
adapted and used to study n-hexane (n-C6) adsorption.
Samples (30 mg) were activated in situ under dry N2
by raising the temperature from ambient to 573 K at
a rate of 10 K min−1, and kept at that temperature for
30 min before cooling to 363 K for n-hexane adsorp-
tion. The latter was achieved by diverting the N2 ﬂow
through a double stage saturator containing n-hexane
(Aldrich, purity 99%) at 293 K (P/P0 of n-C6 = 0.18).
Weight gains (%) due to adsorption of n-hexane are
referred to the sample weight measured after activa-
tion at 573 K.
FT-IR spectra of the catalysts were obtained using
a Nicolet Nexus FT-IR spectrometer, either as KBr
wafers (1 mg of zeolite ground in 200 mg KBr) in
the transmission mode for the study of lattice vibra-
tions in the 400–1200 cm−1 range or using the DRIFT
mode, after in situ degassing, to study the OH re-
gion (3000–4000 cm−1). A Spectra-Tech high temper-
ature/high pressure cell, ﬁtted with ZnSe windows,
was specially designed for the in situ studies.
NH3-TPD analyses were performed on samples
exchanged with an ammonia buffer solution (1 M
NH4Cl/NH4OH, pH 9.4) ensuring that all chlorine
ions were removed by extensive washing. A Setaram
TG-DTG-DSC-111
thermoanalyser,
using
helium
ﬂow, was used to follow the desorption of ammo-
nia from ambient temperature to 973 K. Desorbed
ammonia was titrated with a sulfamic acid solution
(3.10×10−3 M) using an automated Metrohm titrator
connected to the outlet of the thermal analyser.
TPR proﬁles were obtained with a Micromeritics
TPD/TPR 2900 analyser using 5 vol.% hydrogen in
argon as reducing atmosphere. Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples
were activated at 423 K under nitrogen to remove wa-
ter prior to TPR analysis. A microbalance, accurate to
0.002 mg attached to a calorimeter built in the same
equipment (Setaram DSC-TG-DTA 111) was used to
determine the effect of hydrogen/oxygen cycles. Af-
ter drying to constant weight at 423 K in nitrogen,
the samples were ﬁrst heated in pure hydrogen up to
1073 K and then in air (293–1073 K).
XPS measurements were performed with an ES-
CALAB 200R (VG Scientiﬁc) spectrometer using the
Al K (1486.6 eV) radiation. The following photo-
electron lines were recorded: Ga 2p3/2, Ga 3d, Si 2p,
Al 2p, O 1s, O 2s and C 1s, and the binding energies
values were corrected for charging effect by referring
to the adventitious C 1s line at 284.5 eV.
27Al and 29Si MAS-NMR spectra were recorded
using a Bruker Avance DSX400 spectrometer with a
spinning frequency of 4 kHz. For 27Al spectra (ν0 =
104.27 MHz), a recycling time of 0.5 s and a short
pulse time of 0.25 s were used. For 29Si spectra (ν0 =
79.49 MHz), the recycling time was 120 s and the 90◦
pulse 5 s. Chemical shifts for 29Si and 27Al are re-
ferred to tetramethyl silane (TMS) and to an aqueous
solution of Al(NO3)3·6H2O, respectively.

For the HRTEM analyses, the samples were dis-
persed in ethanol using a sonicator, a drop of the sus-
pension was deposited onto a copper grid coated with
a carbon ﬁlm, and then ethanol was quickly evap-
orated. A JEOL 2010 high resolution transmission
electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of
200 kV was used. This microscope was equipped with
a high-resolution pole piece and an energy dispersive
X-ray spectrometer (Link Isis from Oxford Instru-
ments). Ga/(0.5) samples (dried, calcined, and H2–O2
treated) were chosen for these analysis, as the most
representative of this work. To ensure that the observa-
tions were statistically representative, more than ﬁfty
analyses were performed for each sample with an elec-
tron beam size of 25 nm, except for some wider zones
of 300–500 nm.
2.3. Catalytic testing
Propane aromatisation reaction was studied in a
ﬂow tubular stainless steel micro-reactor loaded with
1–1.5 g catalyst) with GC analysis on line. For cat-
alytic measurements the system was purged with he-
lium for 0.5 h. The sample/reactor was then heated
up to 423 K under helium ﬂow and kept at 423 K for
2 h to remove adsorbed water. Temperature was then
increased to 573 K (2 K min−1). Finally, the catalyst
was exposed to air and the temperature progressively
raised (0.4 K min−1) to 823 K where it was maintained
for another 2 h. The Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was then
subjected to successive H2–O2 cycles for 2 h (1 h in
H2, 1 h in O2). Propane was contacted with the cat-
alyst for 2 min at 823 K between cycles to monitor
its catalytic activity for the aromatisation of propane.
Products were analysed on line with a VARIAN GC
3400CX using with TCD a 2.5 m (0.3175 cm o.d.,
1.905 cm) Haysep F column for CO2 and hydrocar-
bons and a 1 m (0.3175 cm o.d., 1.905 cm) Molsieve
13X column for O2, CO, CH4 and with FID a 25 m
capillary column (DB-1) for aliphatics and aromatics.
3. Results and discussion
Exchanging trivalent cations into ZSM-5 zeolite is
difﬁcult because this material is rather hydrophobic
and its Al sites where ion-exchange occurs are quite
separated. In addition, its anionic ﬁeld is weak due
to its high Si/Al ratio and its intermediate pore size
restricts the access of highly hydrated cations to its
intracrystalline volume.
Bénézeth et al. [11] have shown that the distri-
bution of Ga species in aqueous solution depends
strongly on pH and temperature. At pH 3.0 and
T ∼303 K (which are the pH range and temperature
usually used for ion-exchange), the Ga speciation is
strongly dominated by the positively charged species
Ga3+ (∼50%) and Ga(OH)2+ (∼50%). Increasing
temperature up to 423 K causes the disappearance
of the former and favours less positively charged
species, such as Ga(OH)2+ (∼10%), Ga(OH)2+
(∼60%), and Ga(OH)30 (∼30%). This means that,
in the ion-exchange conditions used in this study
(T = 373 K), the Ga species in solutions are expected
to be Ga(OH)2+ and Ga(OH)2+, with the latter being
likely dominant.
The aluminium content was found equal for all sam-
ples and corresponds to 5.05 Al per unit cell (Si/Al =
18). The gallium loadings of the different samples
are given in Table 1. The ﬁrst two loadings are less
than the ion-exchange capacity of 5.05 Ga per unit
cell assuming that ion-exchanged Ga species have a
+1 charge only, whether gallium is reduced as Ga+
species or present as partially hydrated Ga3+ species,
e.g. Ga(OH)2+, Ga(OH)2+ or GaO+.
3.1. XRD characterisation
XRD results for freshly ion-exchanged and dried
samples show the presence of the oxide hydrate
GaO(OH) (JCPDS 06-0180, diffraction line at 2θ =
24.8◦(d = 4.18 nm) which does not overlap any
zeolite peak). As seen in Fig. 1A (ex situ experi-
ments), the intensity of this peak varies linearly with
Ga content. Following calcination at 823 K, the XRD
line characteristic of GaO(OH) whose intensity for
the Ga/(0.5) sample was about 1.7% of that of a
zeolite diffraction line at d = 3.84 nm, disappeared
and a new and broader line appeared at 2θ = 41.9◦
(d = 2.51 nm) that could be assigned to Ga2O3 parti-
cles. As seen in Fig. 1B, the intensity of the latter also
varies linearly with Ga content. However, its intensity
after the H2–O2 treatment cycles decreased drasti-
cally. These results show that after ion-exchange and
drying Ga species are mainly present as GaO(OH)
and that calcination converts these species into Ga2O3

particles. Furthermore, they suggest that Ga2O3 par-
ticles are highly re-dispersed upon H2–O2 cycling,
resulting in diffraction lines broadening.
The crystallinity of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples de-
termined by XRD and from the ratio of the intensities
of the IR bands at 550 and 450 cm−1 [12] (Table 1) is
only slightly affected by the different treatments. Re-
ﬂections recorded in the in situ cell, characteristic of
the ZSM-5 framework in the 22–25◦2θ range, show
only small lattice parameter changes depending on gas
and temperature conditions. Some contraction of the
framework was observed after heating to 823 K and
it is assigned to the desorption of physisorbed water.
This contraction was smaller after the H2 treatment
probably due to the incorporation of Ga species within
the zeolite channels.
3.2. XPS analyses
Comparison between chemical analysis and XPS
data for H-ZSM-5 and Ga/(0.5) samples (Table 2)
shows the occurrence of Al zoning in the zeolite crys-
tallites, their surface being enriched in aluminium as
the Si/Al ratio measured by XPS is smaller than the
bulk Si/Al ratio determined by chemical analysis. The
chemical and XPS analyses shown in Table 2 also
demonstrate that the bulk and surface Si/Al ratios of
the Ga/(0.5) dried and calcined samples were not af-
fected by the treatments to which the parent Ga/(0.5)
material was submitted. The Si/Ga ratio measured by
XPS is about seven times smaller than the Si/Ga ra-
tio determined by chemical analysis, which indicates
that Ga species are mostly located at the surface of the
zeolite crystallites. For higher Ga loadings the same
phenomenon was observed but to a much lesser ex-
tent, e.g. for Ga/(1) and Ga/(2) samples Si/Ga atom
ratios were found by XPS equal to 20 and 15 for cal-
cined samples, respectively, against 30 and 14 from
chemical analysis.
After H2–O2 treatment, both XPS and chemical
analysis ratios are comparable in all cases, which con-
ﬁrms that Ga species are then distributed nearly homo-
geneously within the zeolite crystallites. Any change
in the Si/Ga ratio measured by XPS must be related to
the migration of gallium from the external surface of
the zeolite crystallites to their intracrystalline volume.
Therefore, as the Si/Ga ratio increases, it is obvious
that H2–O2 cycles promote the migration of gallium
species into the zeolite channels, which is in agree-
ment with the smaller contraction of the framework
observed by XRD (vide supra) upon desorption of
water.

These observations imply that Ga species are very
mobile in ZSM-5 zeolite under oxidising or reducing
environments as pointed out earlier [13], with a pref-
erence to be at the external surface of the zeolite be-
fore and after calcination and more homogeneously
distributed in the zeolite channels following H2–O2
treatments. Thermodynamics shows that, in the pres-
ence of hydrogen at 823 K, Ga2O3 is reduced to Ga2O
that has a high vapour pressure (∼2.4×10−3 Pa). The
latter species can migrate into the zeolite channels
when the catalyst is subjected to a hydrogen activation
treatment and can be further “anchored” to the zeolite
by a subsequent treatment in oxygen. Thus, repeated
H2–O2 oxygen cycles were shown to increase sub-
stantially the dispersion of gallium [14]. It was pro-
posed that the highly dispersed Ga-species following
H2–O2 treatments are GaO+ species in ion-exchange
position. Scheme 1 summarises this phenomenon.
It was also observed that the Ga 2p3/2 binding
energy values for gallium in the dried and calcined
samples are higher (1118.2 and 1118.1 eV, respec-
tively) than those characteristic of Ga2O3 (1117.8 eV)

[15], indicating a more ionic character of the Ga–O
bond. This binding energy value was found lower
(1117.6 eV) following the H2–O2 cycles, indicating a
stronger (more covalent) bonding between the gallium
species (presumably GaO+) and the zeolite frame-
work. These data support the suggestion that the latter
gallium species are located at zeolite ion-exchange
sites. Similar conclusions were reached on calcined
Ga-BEA zeolite by Chao et al. on the basis of 71Ga
MAS-NMR, XPS and IR data [16] and on 823 K hy-
drogen reduced Ga BEA sample on the basis of XAS
and 71Ga MAS-NMR data [17]. Note that Shpiro
et al. [18] observed by XPS the reduction of only
30% Ga3+ to Ga+ upon H2 treatment at 773 K by de-
convolution of the Ga 3d peak at ca. 20.0 eV into two
peaks, one at 21.0 eV assigned to Ga+3 and the sec-
ond at 19.7–20.2 eV assigned to Ga+. Surprisingly,
these authors did not report any shift of the 2p3/2
peak. In our experiments, the signal-to-noise ratio for
the Ga 3d peak was too low to enable a reliable peak

deconvolution and the apparent discrepancy between
our and earlier observations may simply result of
different Ga loadings.
3.3. FT-IR results
The FT-IR spectrum of the Ga/(0.5) calcined sam-
ple shows a shoulder at ca. 760 cm−1 and a broad
absorption band in the range 650–750 cm−1 compared
to the spectrum of the parent H-ZSM-5 material, as
seen in Fig. 2. These features are likely to be due to
the presence Ga2O3 which shows a peak at 690 cm−1
with a small shoulder at 760 cm−1. After H2–O2
treatment, both the shoulder and the broad absorption
band disappeared entirely, indicating the disappear-
ance of the Ga2O3 phase. In the latter case, the sym-
metric stretching vibration of Si–O–T (T = Al, Ga) at
1090 cm−1 was also shifted to 1088 cm−1. This shift
could reﬂect either the incorporation of some Ga into
the framework, as it is well known for Al substitution

113
for Si [19] or the migration of gallium following
reducing–oxidising treatments that disperse the Ga
species into the zeolite channels. The latter interpreta-
tion is preferred. Indeed, the interaction of Ga species,
e.g. GaO+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position,
interacting with the zeolite framework are expected to
reduce the O–Al bond strength [20] and this proposal
is in line with the XPS results reported above.
DRIFT spectra of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample in
the OH stretching vibration region show that, after
evacuation, three bands are observed: (i) a band at
∼3739 cm−1 attributed to terminal SiOH groups; (ii)
a band at 3606 cm−1 characteristic of bridging acidic
Brønsted sited [21]; and (iii) a band at 3660 cm−1
which can be assigned to extra-lattice species bearing
hydroxyl groups. After ammonia adsorption followed
by evacuation at ambient temperature, the band near
3650 cm−1, was deconvoluted into two bands centred
at 3660 and 3642 cm−1, most probably corresponding
to gallium species such as Ga(OH)2+ or Ga(OH)2+ in
ion-exchange position.
3.4. Adsorption of nitrogen and n-hexane
Nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K for all sam-
ples were of type I as expected for zeolites. The
intracrystalline pore volumes of the Ga-modiﬁed
H-ZSM-5 samples, following various treatments, were
determined using the Harwath–Kawazoe equation
(Table 1). They only show small variations (within
10%) that can be attributed to the presence and re-
distribution of Ga species in the zeolite channels, in
particular following H2–O2 treatment cycles.
The n-hexane adsorption capacity of the calcined Ga
samples is only slightly smaller than that of the parent
zeolite (only about 10% as shown in Table 1) indicat-
ing that Ga species are mostly located at the external
surface of the zeolite crystallites and that some pore
mouth blockage may occur, in particular for higher
Ga loadings (e.g. Ga/(4)). Nitrogen and n-hexane ad-
sorption results are consistent with the observations
reported above.
3.5. MAS-NMR study
The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of the NH4+-form
of calcined and H2–O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples are
shown in Fig. 3A and B. Two main signals [22] are
observed centred at approximately −112 ppm corre-
sponding to Si (4Si) and at approximately −105 ppm
corresponding to Si (1T, 3Si), with T being Al, Ga
or a defect site. Both spectra are very similar indicat-
ing that it is most unlikely that any Ga substitution
occurred in the ZSM-5 lattice following the H2–O2
treatments.
Following the procedure used by Fyfe et al. [23]
who deconvoluted the 29Si NMR spectrum of a highly
crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite into nine peaks correspond-
ing to 29Si in various crystallographic sites, seven
peaks were used to ﬁt the signal observed after calci-
nation and H2–O2 treatment, as shown in Fig. 3. Only
minor changes are observed. Replacement of Al by
Ga should result in a shift of the 29Si peak by 3 pm
[24], which is not the case here. Consequently, we can
conclude that Ga following H2–O2 treatment is not in-
corporated in the zeolite framework but most probably
present as ion-exchanged species.
Deconvolution of the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra per-
mits to calculate the Si/Al ratio for the different sam-
ples [24] as shown in Table 3. It is also possible to
calculate this ratio from the 27Al MAS-NMR spectra
shown in Fig. 4. It is remarkable that there is only a
small difference between the ratio calculated by ICP
(Si/Al = 18) and those obtained from 29Si and 27Al
MAS-NMR. The small increase of the Si/Al ratio for
the calcined and H2–O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples may
be assigned to the presence of some extra framework
aluminium likely to be generated by the calcination
and H2–O2 treatments.
27Al MAS-NMR spectra show that the starting
zeolite material does not contain extra framework
aluminium and that modiﬁcation by gallium leads
to partial dealumination (tetrahedral framework alu-
minium peak at ∼54 ppm and octahedral extra frame-
work aluminium at ∼0 ppm; Fig. 4) in agreement
with previous reports [25]. In addition, a small shift
and a small broadening of the tetrahedral aluminium

peak to lower chemical shifts were also observed
upon H2–O2 treatment (Table 4), which reﬂect most
likely the modiﬁcation of the 27Al environment by
ion-exchanged cationic Ga species as the chemical
shift is related to the tri-dimensional chemical shield-
ing of the observed nucleus (27Al in this case) by
the surrounding electrons, i.e. to the electronic and

ilar observations were made for the calcined and or

act as counter-cations in the Ga-modiﬁed zeolite.
3.6. Ammonia temperature programmed
desorption (TPD)
NH3-TPD of NH4+-exchanged samples shows that
the amount of ammonia desorbed between 533 and
973 K corresponds to 9.6 (5.2 per unit cell), 10.2 (5.4
per unit cell), 10.3 (5.6 per unit cell), 7.7 (4.2 per unit
cell) and 6.8 (3.7 per unit cell) × 10−4 moles of NH3

per gram for the H-ZSM-5, Ga/(0.5), Ga/(1), Ga/(2)
and Ga/(4) calcined samples, respectively. These val-
ues should be compared to the number of Brønsted
sites (i.e. tetrahedral Al sites) per unit cell, i.e. 5.05.
The decrease in the amount of desorbed ammonia at
high Ga loading can be attributed to partial dealumi-
nation, as quantiﬁed by NMR It is interesting to note
that following H2–O2 treatment, the amount of am-
monia desorbed from Ga/(0.5) is increased by about
6%, i.e. to 5.4 NH3 per unit cell.
Mild dealumination (12 and 17% for the cal-
cined and H2–O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples, respec-
tively) occurred most likely, as demonstrated by 27Al
MAS-NMR, because gallium is introduced at pH 3
and because some water is formed during the H2–O2
treatments at 823 K, inducing some steaming. There-
fore, the increase in ammonia adsorption for Ga/(0.5)
following H2–O2 treatment must be attributed to the
presence of cationic Ga species in ion-exchange posi-
tion. Those act as Lewis acidic sites and are capable to
adsorb more than one ammonia molecule per cation.
Two endothermic ammonia desorption peaks are ob-
served in the DSC spectrum of the NH4+-exchanged
Ga/(0.5) sample, at 823 K and 903 K, respectively,
the former being the largest. For H-ZSM-5, these
peaks appear at 833 K and 903 K, respectively,
with the 903 K peak being smaller than for the
NH4+-exchanged Ga/(0.5) sample. It is therefore
likely that the 903 K peak corresponds to the adsorp-
tion of ammonia on Lewis acid sites.
3.7. TPR and TG/DSC
Additional information on the nature and location
of the gallium species in the Ga/(0.5) sample, follow-
ing various treatments, were obtained from TPR and
TG/DSC studies performed under reducing and oxidis-
ing conditions. Gallium may be present as oxide or hy-
droxide species deposited in the pores or at the exter-
nal surface of the zeolite crystals, and/or it may occupy
cationic positions in the zeolite channels as discussed
above. These Ga species should have different redox
properties depending on their nature and environment.
No reduction of pure Ga2O3 was observed in
our conditions, which agrees with a previous report
of Price and Kanazirev [26] and demonstrates that
the presence of acidic sites is necessary for the re-
duction of gallium oxide to occur. Reduction of a

Fig. 5. TPR proﬁles observed for calcined Ga/(0.5), Ga/(1), Ga/(2)
and Ga/(4) samples.
Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 mixture (1.3 wt.% Ga), starts at
about 850 K and peaks at around 1010 K.
Fig. 5 shows the TPR curves observed for the four
calcined samples differing by their Ga content. Three
distinct reduction peaks are observed: a small and
broad one near 730 K whose intensity is not much
affected by Ga loading, a narrow and intense one at
900 K whose intensity increases with Ga content at low
Ga loading, and a broad one at 1050–1100 K whose
intensity increases nearly continuously with Ga load-
ing (in particular, when the amount of Ga present ex-
ceeds the ion-exchange capacity of the zeolite). Con-
sequently, the latter peak is assigned to large, bulk
Ga2O3 particles separated from or loosely supported
on the zeolite matrix. The major peak at 900 K is at-
tributed to well-dispersed Ga species such as small
Ga2O3 particles or GaO+ species interacting with the
zeolite, and the weak peak near 730 K should arise
from other well-dispersed Ga species, not precisely
identiﬁed, present in very small concentration.
Following H2–O2 treatment of the Ga/(0.5) sample,
the peaks at 730 and 900 K are still observed, with
the same general characteristics, whereas the broad
peak at 1050–1100 K has disappeared, conﬁrming that
bulk and large Ga2O3 species have been dispersed.
Fig. 6. TG/DSC study of oxidation/reduction cycles for calcined
Ga/(0.5).
Quantitative determination of the total H2 consump-
tion shows that Ga3+ is nearly totally reduced to Ga+
in all cases.
The effect of a H2–O2 redox cycle on calcined
Ga/(0.5) was further investigated by TG/DSC. The
results are shown in Fig. 6. Reduction again occurs
in two steps (a shoulder at ca. 675 K and a peak at
840 K; both peaks are shifted by ca. 60 K to lower
temperature due to the different operating conditions)
conﬁrming the H2-TPR results. The weight loss upon
reduction for the Ga/(0.5) dried sample was found
equal to 0.96% suggesting that oxidic or hydroxidic
GaIII species are completely reduced to GaI species
(0.96 wt.% loss against a theoretical value of about
0.91%). Re-oxidation of the reduced material pro-
ceeded in several steps, the main step occurring at
470 K, a temperature that is rather low but not unex-
pected considering that reduced Ga species are highly
dispersed as discussed above.
3.8. HRTEM–EDX analyses
The distribution of the Ga species in the dried, cal-
cined, and H2–O2-treated samples was further inves-
tigated by HRTEM–EDX.
I. Nowak et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 251 (2003) 107–120
117
Fig. 7. HRTEM picture and EDX analyses of calcined Ga/(0.5).
For the dried and calcined Ga/(0.5) samples, both
the HRTEM pictures and EDX results were quite
similar. One distinguishes clearly (Fig. 7) needles
of gallium oxide (0.5–1.5 m long and 0.1–0.2 m
wide) and zeolite crystals of a few m supporting
micro-crystallites (diameter = 4–5 nm) of Ga ox-
ide, GaO(OH) or Ga2O3, on their external surface.
The latter are most probably the highly dispersed Ga
oxide particles which were reduced at 900 K in our
H2-TPR study (vide supra). The Si/Al atomic ratio
varies in the range 8–14 in the surface layers against
14–24 in the interior of the zeolite crystallites and the
Si/Ga ratio varies in the range 100–400, demonstrat-
ing that there is Al zoning in the zeolite crystallites,
the surface being richer in Al as also shown by XPS
(vide supra), and that the distribution of Ga is not
homogeneous. When wider zones of the zeolite crys-
tals were analysed (300–500 nm), the Si/Al and Si/Ga
ratios were 20 and 150, respectively. The ﬁrst value is
close to the expected average chemical composition
(Si/Al = 18) while the second one shows a lower Ga
concentration in the zeolite relative to chemical anal-
ysis (Si/Ga ∼90), in agreement with the presence of
large Ga2O3 crystallites.
The H2–O2-treated sample (Fig. 8) shows very dif-
ferent features. Most of the needles have disappeared
and those remaining appear spongy. They also contain
an appreciable amount of Si suggesting that Ga silicate
species have been formed. Small Ga oxide crystallites
are not observed anymore at the external surface of
the zeolite crystals conﬁrming that migration of Ga
species into the zeolite channels has indeed occurred.
This is also conﬁrmed by the fact that the Si/Ga ratio
range is narrower: only 100–250, i.e. showing a more
118

homogeneous and higher average content of Ga in the
zeolite crystals. As expected, there is no change in the
Si/Al ratio of the zeolite.
The distribution of Ga in the zeolite crystallites fol-
lows that of Al due to Al zoning as shown in the
HRTEM micrograph and EDX analyses values pro-
vided in Fig. 8. Near the surface of the zeolite crys-
tallites, Si/Al = 8.4 and Si/Ga = 70 whereas in the
bulk Si/Al = 20 and Si/Ga = 250. This indicates fur-
ther that the highly dispersed Ga species formed upon
H2–O2 treatment are most likely at cationic exchange
positions associated to framework Al, either as GaO+
or Ga(OH)2+ species.
The HRTEM–EDX results substantiate our former
conclusions and demonstrate further that Ga-modiﬁed
H-ZSM-5 is a very complex system in which sev-
eral phases are simultaneously present, whose nature,
distribution, and location is strongly affected by the
treatments to which the catalyst is subjected. Such con-
clusions were previously mentioned in the literature
[10,16,27,28] and have been quantiﬁed in this work.
The resulting model showing the transformations
of Ga species occurring upon calcination and H2–O2
treatments is shown in Scheme 2 that is in agreement
with previous reports [27].
3.9. Catalytic results: propane aromatisation
A dual mechanism involving zeolite Brønsted sites
and highly dispersed Ga species acting in synergy,
whose amount increase with successive H2–O2 treat-
ments, has been proposed for the initial activation
of propane, via a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane
(PPCP) transition state [13]. It was concluded that
the main contribution of Ga to the performance of a
Ga-modiﬁed ZSM-5 catalyst used for propane aroma-
tisation was to this initial step.

Catalytic
results
obtained
at
high
conversion
(97–99%, 823 K) show that highly dispersed Ga
species may also play a role, although smaller, in the
aromatisation reactions as shown in Table 5.
In all cases, the catalysts show a higher activity
and selectivity to aromatic compounds after treat-
ment by hydrogen, together with a higher selectiv-
ity to methane, ethylene, and C5+ compounds and
a lower selectivity to ethane and C4 alkanes. The
selectivity to propene remains small in all cases,
probably as it is dimerised to produce a C6 oleﬁn
that is readily dehydrogenated further and aroma-
tised. The higher selectivities to ethylene, C5+, and
aromatic compounds after H2 treatment should be
attributed to the lower acidity (Brønsted and Lewis)
and higher dehydrogenation efﬁciency of the cat-
alyst due the higher dispersion of gallium as GaI
species. As aromatisation of propane produces a large
amount of hydrogen (a valuable by-product), it is
thus not surprising that the selectivity to methane, a
partial sink for the hydrogen evolved, increases as
more aromatics are produced. These results agree
with previous observations [8,13,27,29] and conﬁrm
further the critical role played by highly dispersed
Ga species acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic
sites.
4. Conclusions
Zeolite H-ZSM-5 following Ga ion-exchange and
drying at 293 K contains mostly GaO(OH) small par-
ticles (diameter = 4–5 nm) located on the external
surface of the zeolite crystallites, a few Ga cationic
species in ion-exchange position and some large crys-
tallites of gallium oxide. Upon calcination, GaO(OH)
small particles are transformed into Ga2O3 particles
of comparable size also located at the outer surface of
the zeolite crystallites.
Reduction–oxidation cycles at 823 K promote the
migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where
highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in
ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely
Ga(OH)2+ species. Evidence for the interaction of
the latter species with the zeolite framework, and
their probable synergistic action, was obtained from
FT-IR, XPS and 27Al MAS-NMR studies as well as
HRTEM–EDX results showing a correlation between
the distribution of Ga and Al in the zeolite, following
various treatments.
From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly
dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting
in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to
achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species
in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.
The latter is probably the case when the process is
operated at high conversion, i.e. in conditions where
ample hydrogen, as a product, is available such that
Ga should be kept in a reduced state.
