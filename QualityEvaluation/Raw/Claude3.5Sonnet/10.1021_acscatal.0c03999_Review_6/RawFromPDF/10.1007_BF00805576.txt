The activation and dehydrogenation of CH4 on Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 have been investigated under non-oxidizing condi- 
tions. Unsupported Mo2C exhibited very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K. The main reaction pathway was 
the decomposition of methane to give hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support 
somewhat enhanced its catalytic activity, but did not change the products of the reaction. A dramatic change in the product forma- 
tion occurred on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons benzene was produced with a selectivity of 
70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also led to a very active catalyst: the conver- 
sion of 
methane at the steady state was 5-6% and the selectivity 
of benzene formation was 85%.

1. Introduction 
Recently many attempts have been made to activate 
methane under non-oxidative conditions and to convert 
it into higher hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds. 
In the case of supported Pt metal catalysts the dehydro- 
genation of methane occurred readily yielding a small 
amount of ethane in addition to the main products, H2 
and surface carbon [ 
1-9]. The subsequent hydrogenation 
of the most reactive carbon gave several higher hydro- 
carbons and even benzene [1-9]. 
Similar studies on MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts produced 
more attractive results: it appeared that methane can be 
directly transformed to aromatic products [10-13]. 
Wang et al. [10] reported 100% selectivity of benzene for- 
mation at 7.2% conversion. In our study, the maximum 
selectivity for benzene formation (taking into account 
only the C-containing gaseous products) was 61-75% at 
973 K and at 2.0-5.7% CH4 conversion [11,12]. After a 
rather long induction period, this reaction occurred also 
on MoO3/SiO2 (the highest selectivity to benzene was 
56% at a methane conversion of 3.2%) [11]. Recently the 
conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and 
benzene was observed on K2MoO4/ZSM-5 catalyst with 
somewhat lower CH4 conversion (1o2-6.3% at 973 K) 
than on MoO3/ZSM-5~ but still with high selectivity 
(60-67%) of benzene formation [12]. 
As the reduction of Mo 
6+ to Mo 
4+ proceeded during 
the induction period, Mo 
4+ or its compounds were con-

sidered as key species in the methane conversion [11]. 
Taking into account the large amount of carbon depos- 
ited on the catalyst in the course of the high temperature 
methane reaction, MoaC is a good candidate for the 
active compound. Recently Lunsford et al. [13] identi- 
fied the formation of MOEC from MoO3/ZSM-5 follow- 
ing the methane treatment at 973 K by means of XPS, 
and we did the same from KEMoOa/ZSM-5 and from 
MoO3/SiOz [12]. 
In the present paper the interaction of CH4 is investi- 
gated with unsupported and supported MOEC under the 
same conditions as reported in our previous studies 
[11,12]. 
2. Experimental 
The reactor and the analysis of the products were 
described previously [11]. Briefly, reactions were carried 
out in a fixed bed, continuous flow reactor consisting of 
a quartz tube (20 mm i.d.) connected to a capillary tube. 
Undiluted CH4 was used. The flow rate was 12 ml/min. 
The selectivity 
values of product formation represent the 
fraction of methane that has been converted to specific 
products taking into account the number of carbon 
atoms in the molecules. 
MoaC was the product of Aldrich, its surface area is 
1.1 ma/g. The sample was characterized by X-ray photo- 
electron spectroscopy. Binding energies were normal- 
ized to the Fermi level of Mo. The XPS peaks for Mo(3d) 
and C(ls) were located at 228.9 and 283.8 eV, 
respectively.

F Solymosi et al. / Methane conversion to benzene over Mo 
2C catalysts 
A mixture of Mo2C and ZSM-5 was prepared by the 
slurry method. ZSM-5 was suspended in triply distilled 
water and the fine powder of Mo2C was added slowly to 
a stirred slurry of ZSM-5. Water was evaporated while 
the slurry was stirred. The solid was homogenized and 
further dried at 403 K. The homogenized powders were 
slightly pressed into wafers and calcined in situ. 
Supported Mo2C was prepared according to the method 
of Lee et al. [14]. Starting material in this case was 2 wt% 
MoO3/ZSM-5 which was obtained by impregnating the 
H-ZSM-5 (Si/A1 = 55.0) zeolite with a basic solution of 
ammonium paramolybdate [ 
11 
]. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Reactions of 
methane on unsupported Mo2C 
As shown in fig. 1 methane interacts with Mo2C at 
973 K. The reaction starts with a maximum rate, the con- 
version is, however, very low (0.16%), which further 
decreases in time. The main gaseous product is H2. 
Ethane is formed only in a very small amount. No 
change in the products occurred after several hours of 
reaction. Variation of the temperature, in the range of 
873-1073 K, resulted in the same picture. 
One possible reason for the low reactivity of Mo2C is 
that during its preparation excess carbon was deposited 
on the surface of Mo2C, which poisoned its surface. 
When treating the Mo2C with hydrogen, methane 
evolved, which supports the presence of carbon contami- 
nation. This carbon species was removed by isothermal 
H/-treatment at 873 K, where bulk carbon was found to 
be unreactive [14-16]. 
Exposing the catalyst, free of contamination of non- 
carbidic carbon, to methane flow at 973 K, we obtained 
somewhat higher initial activity, but the general behav- 
ior remained the same (fig. 1). Examination of the cat- 
alyst surface after methane decomposition for 2 h 
showed the formation of excess carbon on the surface of 
Mo2C catalyst. This carbon exhibited very low reactiv- 
ity. Whereas on supported Pt metal catalysts, the hydro- 
genation of the most reactive carbon produced by 
methane decomposition gave C4-C6 compounds [1-9], 
in the present case we obtained only methane. According 
to the TPR profile, the excess carbon formed in the high 
temperature decomposition of methane on Mo2C is 
hydrogenated only above 800 K. 
In the next experiment the catalytic performance of 
Mo2C mixed with ZSM-5 was examined. It is known that 
ZSM-5 is a very active catalyst in the oligomerization 
and aromatization of ethylene [17,18]. As shown in fig. 1, 
the use of Mo2C/ZSM-5 still resulted in very little activ- 
ity in the methane decomposition and caused no change 
in the product distribution. (This sample contained an 
amount of Mo which corresponds to 2 wt% MOO3.) 
Increasing the amount of Mo/C to 30%, the initial con- 
version of CH4 was still below 0.5% at 973 K. 
The absence of a larger production of hydrocarbons 
suggests that methane decomposes completely to carbon

on Mo2C under the reaction conditions. The formation 
of a small amount of ethane indicates that the primary 
product, CH3, of the dissociation of CH4, 
CH4 ~- CH3 + H, 
may have a sufficient lifetime to recombine into ethane, 
2CH3 ~ C2H6. 
Due to the high reaction temperature, this reaction very 
likely occurs in the gas phase, similarly as during the oxi- 
dative coupling of CH4. The presence of ZSM-5 could 
not lead to a more active catalyst and did not alter the 
reaction pathways of methane on this Mo2C. In other 
words, it could not promote coupling of the CHx frag- 
ments, CH3 and CH2, possib!y formed in the decomposi- 
tion of CH3 species, to ethane and ethylene. One of the 
reasons of the lack of improvement of the catalytic per- 
formance of MOEC mixed with ZSM-5 is the low disper- 
sion of MOEC, and/or blocking of some of the channels 
in the ZSM-5. 
To overcome this problem, MOEC was produced by 
the carburization of 2% MoO3/ZSM-5 following the 
method of Lee et al. [14] (fig. 2). In this case we experi- 
enced a dramatic change in the conversion of methane 
and also in the product distribution. The conversion of 
methane on MOEC/ZSM-5 is as high as measured for 
MoO3/ZSM-5, and qualitatively the same products 
were formed. There are, however, important differences. 
The induction period is practically missing; the reaction 
starts with the highest rate. Although a decay in the con- 
version occurs in this case too, the conversion at the 
steady state is higher (5-6%) compared to that obtained 
for 2 wt% MoO3/ZSM-5 under the same conditions 
[11,12]. The selectivity to benzene is also higher, 
N 85.0%, on Mo2C/ZSM-50 and remained constant 
after 30 rain. 
The fact that CO was also identified among the prod- 
ucts suggests that the carburization of highly dispersed 
MoO3 was not complete during the preparation of 
Mo2C on ZSM-5. Accordingly, we may count with the 
presence of some kind of 
molybdenum oxide. 
3.2. Effects of 
partial oxidation 
of 
Mo2C 
In order to explore the influence of molybdenum oxi- 
des, in the subsequent experiments we examined the 
effect of the oxidation of 2 wt% Mo2C (Aldrich) mixed 
with ZSM-5 support. In a separate thermogravimetic 
study we found that the oxidation of this Mo2C to MoO3 
proceeds at a measurable rate at 773 K [19]. Based on this 
finding, the oxidation of Mo2C was performed in situ to 
different extents and the catalytic behavior of the solid 
so formed was tested. Note that this sample exhibited 
very little activity towards methane decomposition 
before the oxidation (fig. 1). As we wanted to explore the 
product formation in the initial phase of the interaction 
of methane with the partially oxidized catalyst, the 
methane flow through the catalyst bed was stopped dur- 
ing the analysis of outlet gases. The initial products were 
CO, CO2 and H20, which diminished to a very low level

Fig. 3. Effect of the extent of oxidation of 1.4 wt% Mo2C/ZSM-5 at 773 K (Mo2C/ZSM-5 was prepared by mixing Mo2C (Aldrich) with ZSM- 
5) on the initial phase of methane conversion and on the rate of benzene formation at 973 K. The extent of oxidation of Mo2C: (9 15%, (O) 30%, 
([]) 50%. In these experiments the methane flow was stopped during the analysis of the reaction products. 
after 10 min. At the same time, the formation of various 
hydrocarbons including benzene became prominent. In 
fig. 3 are plotted the conversion of methane and the rate 
of benzene formation allowing the oxidation of 1.4 wt% 
Mo2C/ZSM-5 to different extents. The conversion of 
methane started with a maximum value on the sample 
oxidized to 15%. Following a more extensive oxidation, 
the development of a more active catalyst required a 
longer contact of CH4 with the catalyst. This feature was 
also exhibited in the rate of benzene formation. The 
initial rate was high on the Mo2C oxidized to 15%. A 
much lower rate (0.1 #mol at 2.5 min and 2.65 #tool at 
4 min) was measured on the catalyst oxidized to 50%, 
although the conversion of methane was 8% in the latter 
case. All these results suggest that, besides Mo2C, the 
presence of some other Mo compounds, perhaps the 
oxygen deficient MOO2, 
is also necessary for the activa- 
tion of methane and for the promotion of the formation 
of ethylene from CHx fragments. 
ZSM-5 exhibited a high catalytic activity towards 
methane decomposition: the selectivity to benzene 
approached 85% at the methane conversion of 5-6%. 
(iv) It is assumed that Mo2C-MoO2 with an oxygen 
deficiency represent the active catalytic sites for methane 
activation and for the formation of ethylene from CHx 
fragments, which is transformed into benzene on the 
acidic sites of the zeolite.

4. Conclusions 
(i) Commercial Mo2C alone and Mo2C mixed with 
ZSM-5 are rather inactive catalysts in the high tempera- 
ture decomposition of methane. 
(ii) Partial oxidation of this inactive Mo2C/ZSM-5 
led to a more active catalyst; the extent of the oxidation 
influenced the initial conversion of methane and the rate 
of the benzene production.
