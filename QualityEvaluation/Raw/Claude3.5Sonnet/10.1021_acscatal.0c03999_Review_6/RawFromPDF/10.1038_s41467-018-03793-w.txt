The inherent variability and insufﬁciencies in the co-production of propylene from steam
crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed
industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies. The oxidative dehydrogenation
of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially ﬁll this gap while consuming a greenhouse
gas. Non-precious FeNi and precious NiPt catalysts supported on CeO2 have been identiﬁed
as promising catalysts for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively, in ﬂow reactor studies
conducted at 823 K. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed the oxi-
dation states of metals under reaction conditions and density functional theory calculations
were utilized to identify the most favorable reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts.

P
ropylene is one of the most diverse petrochemical building
blocks used for the production of many chemicals (e.g.,
polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile). The co-
production of propylene from steam and ﬂuidized crackers is
anticipated to be insufﬁcient to satisfy the rapidly growing
demand1. Consequently, there is a need for the development of
economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional
propylene. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is ther-
modynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔH°r = 29.70
kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for sig-
niﬁcant propylene yields2. In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a
mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by
oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and conse-
quently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating
temperatures2,3. The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili-
brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the
reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo-
dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a. Additionally, unlike regular oxi-
dative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild
oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the pro-
duction of carbon oxides. The reactions of propane and CO2 also
have the potential to employ two underutilized4–6 reactants to

The reactions of CO2 with propane may occur through two
distinct pathways, oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2 + C3H8 →
C3H6 + CO + H2O) and dry reforming (3CO2 + C3H8 →6CO +
4H2). The two reactions should occur simultaneously at tem-
peratures around 823 K and above with considerable conversions
(Fig. 1b), allowing the formation of both dehydrogenation pro-
ducts (propylene) and reforming products (synthesis gas). The
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can
reach an equilibrium conversion of 33% as opposed to 17% for
DDP at 823 K. At that same reaction temperature, as seen in
Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of
propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less
than that of methane dry reforming (DRM). This in turn would
reduce catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transfor-
mations triggered by the relatively high temperatures commonly
used in DRM9,10. Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system
unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard
reaction (CO2 + Cs →2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with
moderate rates11,12. Thus, it is of great interest to identify cata-
lysts that can either selectively break the C–H bond to produce
propylene or the C–C bonds to generate synthesis gas (CO + H2).
Previous work in CO2-ODH primarily focuses on supported
chromium catalysts13–15 as a result of their ability to exist in
multiple oxidation states16, but implementation is limited due to
short lifecycles and high toxicity of chromium17. Ni is mainly used
for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking is
still a problem18–20. To alleviate coke formation, precious metal
catalysts (e.g., Rh, Re, Ru) have also been investigated on high
surface area Al2O321,22. However, large scale catalytic conversion of
CO2 into valuable products would require the development of cost
effective, selective, and coking-resistant catalytic systems. While
there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a
thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a
temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lack-
ing. Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has
the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct C–O
bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen
for coke suppression9,23–25.
The present work will explore ceria supported bimetallic cat-
alysts, non-precious metal Fe3Ni as well as precious metal- based
Fe3Pt and Ni3Pt, that are active at 823 K. In summary, steady-
state ﬂow reactor studies indicate that Fe3Ni shows promising
selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway,
whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward
CO. Density functional theory calculations of the energetics for
the C–H and C–C bond scissions over the two catalysts are in
agreement with experimental results.
Results
Catalytic evaluation with kinetics and deactivation patterns.
Flow reactor studies measuring both CO2-ODHP and DRP
activity simultaneously are summarized in Table 1 along with CO
chemisorption values. All catalysts were synthesized via incipient
wetness impregnation of metals onto commercially obtained
CeO2 (35–45 m2/g, Sigma Aldrich). For additional details see
Methods section or Supplementary Methods section. Results for
conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for
all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The mono-
metallic Ni1 catalyst exhibits 12%–87% C3H6 and reforming
selectivity, respectively, with minimal cracking products (CH4
and C2 hydrocarbons), while the Fe3 monometallic catalyst is not
active for either reaction. The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however,
at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-
ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity. The
differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided
in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the
respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2%
over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the for-
mation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst.
Exchanging Ni in the Fe3Ni catalyst with precious metal Pt
(Fe3Pt) roughly reduces the activity by half, decreases the
selectivity toward C3H6 to 32%, and is unstable compared to
Fe3Ni (Supplementary Fig. 2). The other precious metal bimetallic
catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39%

CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at
comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is
more stable compared to monometallic Ni3 (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Thus, when Ni is coupled with non-precious Fe at a ratio
of 1:3, higher dehydrogenation activity can be achieved and
propylene is produced. In contrast, when Ni is alloyed with
precious metal Pt, reforming activity is enhanced compared to
monometallic Ni3. Further analysis, such as the comparison of
CeO2 supported Ni3Pt with Ni3Fe and Fe3Ni catalysts along with
CO selectivity following CO2 conversion plots can be found
in Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, respectively.
Kinetic studies examining the inﬂuence of the reactant partial
pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni
and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences
between the two types of catalysts. The apparent activation
energies were derived by measuring production rates in the
temperature range of 803–843 K. Over Fe3Ni, the activation
barrier for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation was found to
be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation barrier for reforming over
Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1. Arrhenius-type plots and additional
values are available in Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Table 3, respectively. As seen in Fig. 2a, the reactant consumption
rate of C3H8 for the Fe3Ni CO2-ODHP catalyst was initially
unaffected by increasing the partial pressure of CO2 but upon
reaching a C3H8:CO2 ratio of 1:1, the rate started to decline. The
reforming catalyst, on the other hand, was positively inﬂuenced
by the partial pressure of CO2 until the aforementioned ratio of
1:6. Increasing the C3H8 partial pressure produced similar trends
and are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. The declining rates
signify that there are less catalytic sites available for one reactant
when the other is in excess, indicative of competitive adsorption
of adsorbates and/or surface intermediates. Particularly, the rates
for both reactants decrease at high propane partial pressure,
suggesting that as the reaction progresses intermediates from
propane block surface sites and lead to a loss in activity.
To further evaluate how different reaction pathways may
inﬂuence deactivation patterns, both thermogravimetric (TGA)
and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) experiments were
conducted and results are provided in Supplementary Figs 6 and
7, respectively. The TGA results indicate that the Fe3Ni catalyst
only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it
is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking.
The EDS of the spent Fe3Ni sample shows small regions of higher
Ni content, and to a lesser extent regions with higher Fe.
However, in-situ XRD measurements do not reveal obvious
agglomeration formation during reaction, and the absence of
metal diffraction peaks suggests that the metal particles are most
likely less than 2 nm in size (Supplementary Fig. 8). The Ni3Pt
catalyst loses about 8% of its original mass but does not illustrate
signs of sintering. However, the coking over the Ni3Pt catalyst at
comparable propane conversion to Fe3Ni is not signiﬁcant.
Oxidation states by in situ XANES. In situ X-ray absorption near
edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in
order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction
conditions, as shown in Fig. 3. Additional details are available in
Supplementary Note 3. The XANES data identiﬁed that under
reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt
(Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts
consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the
Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form. The extended X-ray
absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) ﬁtting of Fe3Ni suggested the
presence of an inserted oxygen through Fe–O–Fe as well as Fe–O
bonds (Supplementary Table 4). Theofanidis et al. and Kim et al.
studied DRM over higher loading Ni–Fe catalysts (8 wt.% Ni-5 wt.%
Fe, and 8.8 wt.% Ni-2.1 wt.% Fe, respectively) supported on mag-
nesium aluminate and they also observed oxidized Fe under in situ
conditions but in an oxidation state of 2+26,27. For the Ni3Pt cat-
alyst, the EXAFS ﬁtting indicates that the coordination number of
the Pt–Pt and Pt–Ni bonds is 3.4 and 6.4, respectively, conﬁrming
the formation of the Pt–Ni bimetallic bond.
Reaction pathways and DFT calculations. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-
Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces (Supplementary
Fig. 10) to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways
for the oxidative C–H and C–C bond cleavage of propane to form
*CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively.
In these calculations, the surfaces are ﬁrst modiﬁed by *O atoms
assuming that *CO2 dissociates to form *CO + *O. The DFT opti-
mized geometries in Supplementary Fig. 11 show that the inter-
mediates *CH3CH2CH2O, *CH3CH2CHO, and *H2O interact with
the surfaces via the oxygen atoms while other intermediates

*CH3CH2CH2, *CH3CHCH2, *CH3CH2, and *CO interact with the
surfaces via the carbon atoms. It is noted that, even though the
binding conﬁgurations of intermediates are similar on both surfaces,
all the intermediates bind more strongly on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni
(111) than on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) (Supplementary Tables 5
and 6). The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to
calculate the change in energy for the oxidative C–H and C–C bond
scission of propane. On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows
that the pathway for the oxidative C–H bond cleavage lies lower in
energy than that for the C–C bond scission. In contrast, as shown in
Fig. 4b on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the pathway for the C–C bond
cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the C–H bond.
Overall the DFT results reveal that the C–C bond cleavage
pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni
(111) favors the C–H bond cleavage pathway. Kinetically, this is
also the case based on the comparison of activation energies
(Supplementary Table 7). According to the DFT calculations, on
Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111),
the
*O
insertion
reaction
(*CH3CH2CH2 + *O →*CH3CH2CH2O + *) along the C–C bond
cleavage pathway (ΔE = −0.75 eV and Ea = 1.07 eV) is thermo-
dynamically and kinetically more favorable than the oxidative
dehydrogenation reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O →*CH3CHCH2
+ *OH) along the C–H bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = −0.51 eV
and Ea = 1.33 eV). In contrast, on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111),
the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ΔE = 0.29 eV and Ea =
1.02 eV) is more favorable than the *O insertion reaction (ΔE =
0.43 eV and Ea = 3.30 eV). These DFT predictions are in
agreement with experimental observations, suggesting that the
bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface promotes the oxidative C–H
bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2 while the Pt-
terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage
of propane to form *CO.
To account for the potential FeO–Ni interfacial active sites
based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in
the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to
investigate the pathways for the oxidative C–H and C–C bond
cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface. For the FeOx
clusters supported on Ni(111), both Fe6O9 and Fe3O3 clusters on
three layer 7 × 7 Ni(111) and 5 × 5 Ni(111) surfaces (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 12) were considered. The oxygenated species (*O, *CO,
*CH3CH2CH2O, *CH3CH2CHO, and *CH3CH2CO) prefer to
adsorb at the interfacial sites while *CxHy species (*CH3CH2CH2,
*CH3CHCH2, and *CH3CH2) most favorably adsorb on Ni(111)
sites (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Fig. 13). The
energy diagram in Fig. 4c, calculated based on the DFT obtained
binding energies of the potential intermediates, show that the ﬁrst
steps in oxidative C–C and C–H bond cleavage pathways are
competitive. The subsequent step to form *CH3CHCH2 is
downhill in energy along the oxidative C–H bond cleavage
pathway; in contrast, the subsequent steps are uphill in energy
along the oxidative C–C bond cleavage pathway. Again, such
thermodynamic predictions are fully supported by the calculated

that
the
oxidative
dehydrogenation
reaction
(ΔE = −0.40 eV and Ea = 0.29 eV) is highly favorable over the
*O insertion reaction (ΔE = 0.01 eV and Ea = 2.13 eV) on the
Fe3O3/Ni(111) surface. This indicates that the oxidative dehy-
drogenation pathway should be more favorable than reforming,
consistent with experimental observation.
Finally, on the three surfaces studied the desorption of *CO is
expected to be a facile process due to the contribution of entropy at
823 K. *C2H5 is one of the reaction intermediates that undergoes O-
insertion, C–H and C–C bond scission reactions to eventually
produce CO and H2. The *O species on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111)
react with *CxHy to form the *CxHyO intermediate, which promotes
the C–C bond scission. In contrast, the more stable *O on bulk-
terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and the FeO/Ni(111) interface are expected
to remain on the surface, which facilitates the selective C–H bond
scission of propane to produce propylene.
Discussion
Overall, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has
the potential to combine two underutilized4–6 reactants to pro-
duce propylene or syngas. Two types of bimetallic catalysts have
been identiﬁed for the CO2 + C3H8 system. The DFT calculation
results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni
(111) interface should favor C–H bond scission for the CO2-
ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface
should favor the C–C bond cleavage for the DRP pathway. Flow
reactor results are consistent with the DFT calculations as it was
observed that the Fe3Ni catalyst is selective for propylene pro-
duction, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows good activity and CO
selectivity. The oxidation states of the different metals provided
by in situ XANES measurements reveal that Fe3Ni consists of
oxidized Fe and metallic Ni. Future efforts should be geared
toward enhancing propylene yield through the discovery of more
stable and selective catalytic materials.
Methods
Density functional theory calculations. Spin polarized28,29 density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed as an attempt to elucidate the possible
pathways of C–C and C–H bond cleavage of propane over Fe3Ni(111), Ni3Pt(111)
surfaces, and FeO/Ni(111) interface using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package
(VASP) code30,31. Projector augmented wave potentials were used to describe the
core electrons with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)32,33 using
PW91 functionals34. The Kohn−Sham one-electron wave functions were expanded
by using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The Brillouin
zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid in the Monkhorst−Pack scheme35.
Ionic positions were optimized until Hellman–Feynman force on each ion was
smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. The transition state of a chemical reaction was located
using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method implemented in
VASP36. The activation energy (Ea) of a chemical reaction is deﬁned as the energy
difference between the initial and transition states while the reaction energy (ΔE) is
deﬁned as the energy difference between the initial and ﬁnal states.
Catalyst preparation and ﬂow reactor studies. The catalysts evaluated in this
study were synthesized through incipient wetness impregnation of metals onto
commercially obtained CeO2 (35–45 m2/g, Sigma-Aldrich). Flow reactor experi-
ments were performed under atmospheric pressure utilizing a 1/4” quartz U-
shaped reactor. All catalysts were reduced at 723 K for 1 h under a 1:1 H2/Ar ﬂow
(40 mL/min total). Subsequently, the temperature was increased and held at 823 K
in the presence of 1:1:2 CO2, C3H8, and Ar for 12 h. Apparent activation barrier
and reaction order experiments were conducted at slightly different reaction
conditions to ensure operation in a true intrinsic kinetic regime and minimize
transport effects. XANES measurements were conducted using a custom in situ
micro-channel cell holding ~200 mg of catalyst (60–80 mesh) and a 4-channel
vortex ﬂuorescence detector.
