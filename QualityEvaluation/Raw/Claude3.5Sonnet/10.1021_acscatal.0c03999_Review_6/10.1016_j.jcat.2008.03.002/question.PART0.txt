Abstract
The role of vanadyl and peroxovanadate oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was analyzed by density functional
theory (DFT). The dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 and the oxidation of C3H6 occurred over vanadyl oxygen of VOx species, yielding reduced
VOx species. The vanadyl oxygen species were restored via reoxidation of reduced VOx species with O2 and N2O. The ODP reaction with N2O
occurred via a VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox couple, whereas both VV(d0)/VIV(d1) and VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox cycles were active with O2. O2 was a
more active oxidizing agent than N2O. Peroxovanadates as precursors of vanadyl species were formed on reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide
species with O2, but not with N2O. Peroxovanadates were highly reactive for propene oxidation. The absence of peroxovanadates may explain
the superior performance of N2O compared with O2 in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species.

1. Introduction
Among the catalysts for which high propene selectivity has
been achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(ODP) are supported vanadium [13] and molybdenum oxide-
based [4] materials. But with O2 as an oxidizing agent, high
propene selectivity (>80%) is observed only at low propane
conversion (<2%). Recent studies of the ODP reaction over
differently loaded VOx/γ -Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] cat-
alysts have shown that propene selectivity is significantly im-
proved when the reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2.
The effect of N2O on product selectivity has been previously
observed in the oxidative coupling of methane [79], in the
transformation of benzene to phenol [10], and in the oxidation
of ethylene to ethyleneoxide [11]. Although the use of N2O
is economically unattractive because of its high cost and the
product dilution by N2, understanding the origin of the supe-

rior selective performance of N2O compared with O2 may help
identify selective and nonselective elementary processes. This
knowledge is of high scientific and industrial interest, because
it may aid in the design of catalytic materials performing selec-
tively with O2.
One possible explanation for the high propene selectivity in
the ODP reaction with N2O over vanadium-based catalysts was
given previously [5,6]: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species
more slowly than O2. This results in a higher degree of re-
duction of surface VOx species and a lower density of active
oxygen species, which may favor selective propane conversion
to propene over consecutive propene oxidation to carbon ox-
ides. The nature of oxygen species formed during reoxidation
of reduced vanadium oxides by O2 also may play a role [12].
The present contribution aims to further elucidate the role
of various oxygen species in the elementary steps of ODP by
density functional theory (DFT). We considered both lattice
oxygen species in supported vanadates, such as vanadyl oxy-
gen or bridging oxygen, and (nonlattice) oxygen species, such
as superoxo and peroxo species formed on reoxidation of re-
duced vanadium oxide sites.

vanadium oxide.
Formula 1.
We performed DFT calculations on elementary steps of the
oxidation of propane and propene. The latter process con-
tributes to the loss of propene selectivity.
A previous DFT study of the ODP mechanism [21] has
demonstrated that the first and rate-limiting step is hydro-
gen abstraction from propane, leading to a surface propyl
radical coupled to a HOVIV(O)3 surface site. Propene is
formed after a second hydrogen abstraction, leaving either a
VIII(O)3 site if it occurs at the same HOVIV(O)3 site or two
HOVIV(O)3 surface sites if it occurs at another O=VV(O)3
surface site (Fig. 1). Consequently, we do not restrict our
study to the VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox couple, but also consider the
VV(d0)/VIV(d1) redox couple.
2. Models and methods
As in previous studies [21,22], here we adopted vanadyl-
exchanged silsesquioxanes as models of monomeric 1 and
dimeric 49 vanadium oxide species supported on silica. We
also show that the minimal O=V(OH)3 model 5 yielded very
similar results. Because that model is computationally less de-
manding, we adopted it for a systematic study of different re-
action mechanisms on monomeric sites. Hydrogen atoms have
proven to be very effective terminating atoms for silica models
[39], but not necessarily for other oxides. Therefore, the small
models are not suited for studying the effect of different sup-
ports on the activity of supported vanadia sites.
Our DFT calculations used the hybrid B3LYP functional [13,
14] with triple-ζ plus polarization basis sets (TZVP) [15] on all
atoms, along with the Turbomole 5.7 code [1619]. The opti-
mized structures were characterized by frequency calculations.
Formula 2.
All energies include zero-point vibrational energies unless oth-
erwise stated.
Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UB3LYP) was used for systems
with triplet and open-shell singlet (broken-symmetry) spin
states. Spin-projection was applied to obtain the singlet energy
from the broken-symmetry and triplet energies as described
previously ([2022]; also see Eq. (5) of Ref. [21]). We report
the expectation value of the total spin operator only if it devi-
ated significantly (>0.02) from the value of the corresponding
pure spin state.
Gibbs free energies were calculated within the harmonic
oscillator-rigid rotor-ideal gas approximation. The rigid clus-
ter model was adopted; that is, the translational and rotational
degrees of freedom of the clusters representing the surface
site were not considered when evaluating the Gibbs free en-
ergies. This allowed a more direct comparison between the val-
ues obtained with cluster models of different sizes, namely the
monomeric O=V(OH)3 and O=VSi7O12H7 models, as well as
the (O=V)2Si6O12H6 dimer model.
3. Results
We start with a comparison of the two different model
sizes for the ODP intermediates, then consider reoxidation of
VIII(O)3, HOVIV(O)3, and H2O·VIII(O)3 species by N2O
and O2. Finally, we analyze the reactivity and selectivity of oxy-
gen species formed on N2O and O2 interaction with the reduced
vanadium sites in propane and propene oxidation.
3.1. ODP Intermediates: Comparison of models
Fig. 2 shows intermediates resulting from the reaction of
propane with isolated O=V(O)3 species for the silsesquioxane
(VSi7O12H7) models (14) and the O=V(OH)3 models (58).
Similar relative energies and Gibbs free energies were obtained
with both types of cluster models (Table 1). Along the reac-
tion path, the deviations varied between 9 and +12 kJ/mol.
For the transition structure of the first hydrogen abstraction, the
barrier for the small model (see Section 3.7.1, 59 in Table 9)
deviated by <6 kJ/mol from the result for the full silsesquiox-
ane model [21].
3.2. Reoxidation of VIII(d2) species
Fig. 3a shows the reaction pathways for the reoxidation of re-
duced VIII(d2) sites with N2O and O2 for both the VSi7O12H7
(4) and V(OH)3 models (8). Table 2 reports the energies for

N2O, which can adsorb via N or O onto V. The ONN·VIII(d2)
complex (9, 13) was more stable than the NNO·VIII(d2) com-
plex (10, 14), but N2 formation and restoration of the vanadyl
group occurred by decomposition of the latter via a single tran-
sition structure (11, 15) with an energy barrier of around
30 kJ/mol. The reaction was exothermic, with products (12 and
16) around 360 kJ/mol more stable than the initial state.
The similar energies obtained with the two cluster mod-
els (deviations between 8 and +17 kJ/mol) confirmed that
O=V(OH)3 is a valid model for isolated VOx species on
SiO2 supports. Thus, we used this model to conduct a detailed
analysis of the electronic structures involved in the reoxidation
process (Fig. 4). The reoxidation started on the triplet poten-
tial energy surface and arrived at the (closed shell) singlet state,
s16. Spin-crossover [23,24] occurred after t15. We optimized
the structures 14, 15, and 16 on both the triplet (superscript t)
and broken-symmetry potential energy surfaces; Table 2 gives
the energies. The open-shell singlet energies (superscript s)
were obtained by spin projection using the triplet energies at
the broken-symmetry structure.
Compared with the reoxidation of VIII(d2) by N2O, the re-
oxidation with O2 was straightforward. No energy barrier could
be localized with B3LYP. Figs. 3a and 5 illustrate different in-
termediates obtained for different spin states. When O2 in the
triplet state interacted with the VIII(d2) site, which also was in
the triplet ground state, the spins could couple into an (open-
shell) singlet, a triplet, or a quintet state. In the latter, tO2 was
bound weakly to tVIII(d2) (q17 and q20, Table 3). In the open-
shell singlet and triplet states, a superoxovanadate could form
that was around 110 kJ/mol below the entrance channel (t18
and t21). Only in the singlet state could 18/21 further evolve
and reach a peroxovanadate species in the closed-shell singlet
state (s19 and s22), which was around 147 kJ/mol below the
entrance channel.
In terms of the Gibbs free energy, the energy gain from per-
oxovanadate formation is partially or totally compensated for
by the loss of rotational and translational entropy of O2 as it
binds onto the surface. According to our DFT results, the sur-
face peroxovanadate should decompose spontaneously into O2
and the reduced VIII site above 800 K at 1 bar of O2 (Ta-
ble 3). This means that peroxovanadate and O2 +VIII(d2) are in
equilibrium at typical temperatures of the ODP reaction (700
773 K).
We considered two routes for the decomposition of perox-
ovanadate: formation of vanadyl and molecular oxygen in the
gas phase, or reaction with a second VIII(d2) site to yield two
vanadyl sites,
(1)
O2V(O)3 [O=V(O)3 + O] O=V(O)3 + 1
2O2
and
O2V(O)3 + V(O)3
[O=V(O)3 + O + V(O)3] 2O=V(O)3.
(2)
For both reactions, we considered the decomposition of per-
oxovanadate into vanadyl and atomic oxygen as a hypothetical
transition state. This decomposition most likely occurrs with a
continuous energy increase (uphill process) and requirs ener-
gies of 109 and 124 kJ/mol for 19 and 22, respectively. When
the tO atom still interacted with 5, the decomposition energy
was 115 kJ/mol (EZPE of [O·5] is 36 kJ/mol). No transition
structure with a transition mode corresponding to the rupture of
the peroxovanadate into vanadyl and an oxygen atom could be
localized using a transition search method following the decom-
position pathway of 22 into [O·5]. When the O atom leaves the
surface, it recombines with another O atom (coming from, e.g.,
another peroxovanadate) to form O2, making the process very
favorable; see 1 + 1
2O2 and 5 + 1
2O2 in Table 3. This means
that we may consider 1 + O a transition state for 19 yield-
ing 1 + 1
2O2. The desorption energy 19 1 + O (109 kJ/mol)
defines the energy barrier, and the respective desorption rate

(about 107 and 108 s1 at 600 and 800 K, respectively; see
Eq. (X) in the supplementary material of Ref. [30]) defines
the decomposition rate. This does not imply that atomic oxy-
gen existed in any measurable quantity in the system; from
G800 K = 265 kJ/mol for the O 1
2O2 reaction in Table 3,
it follows that the partial pressure of atomic O is 18 orders of
magnitude lower than the O2 partial pressure. It simply implies
that peroxovanadate is in equilibrium with vanadate and O2;
that is, Eq. (1) is an equilibrium.
Alternatively, atomic oxygen released from the peroxo group
can readsorb at a reduced VIII(d2) site. Also for this reaction,
the desorption step would determine the rate, and Eq. (2) would
define an equilibrium.
The reaction of peroxovanadate with a reduced VIII(d2) site
also can occur by migration of oxygen atoms over the silica sup-
port via VOOSi and SiOOSi species instead of the des-
orption/readsorption of oxygen. A recent study [40] cites exper-
imental evidence for such species and reports energy and free
energy profiles for such migration. The latter were calculated
by DFT, adopting a silsesquioxane model like 1 but with one
O=V(O)3 and one reduced VIII(O)3 site. For peroxovanadate
formation, the results were similar (Eel = 180 kJ/mol and
G650 K = 74 kJ/mol [40]) to those reported for 19 in Table 3.
The highest barrier for O migration with respect to the entrance
channel was at Eel = 51 kJ and G650 K = +63 kJ/mol. This
also implies rapid decomposition of about 103 s1 at 650 K; the
route via the desorption/readsorption of atomic oxygen appears
to be faster, however.
In summary, in contrast to reoxidation by N2O, reoxi-
dation of VIII(d2) by O2 exhibited no energy barrier, but
the vanadyl group was not directly restored. First, perox-
ovanadate was formed, after which it was separated from
the vanadyl group and 1
2O2 by an intrinsic barrier of about
109 kJ/mol.
3.3. Reoxidation of VIV(d1) species
Reoxidation of VIV(d1) sites occurred by hydrogen abstrac-
tion from 2 and 6 (Fig. 2) and simultaneous restoration of the
vanadyl group (Fig. 3b). Because similar results were obtained
for the O=V(OH)3 and O=V(OSi)3 models, the following
calculations were made only on the smaller cluster model, 6.

When N2O was abstracting the hydrogen, the products were N2,
OH•, and O=VV(d0) (25). The energy for adsorption of N2O to
HOV(O)3 (23) was slightly negative (Table 4). After crossing
the transition structure 24 (energy barrier, 138 kJ/mol), the en-
ergy became negative (25). The entire reaction occurred on the
doublet potential energy surface.
When reoxidation was achieved by O2, the reaction products
were O=VV(d0) and HOO• (28). HOO• could reoxidize an-
other HOVIV(O)3 site to yield O=VV(O)3 and H2O2 (34) via
transition structure 33 with a barrier of 55 7 (30  24) =
18  24 kJ/mol (see Fig. 3c and energies in Table 5; also
see Section 3.4 for the uncertainty of the energy of 33). The
formed complex 34 could be converted via low barrier steps
42 and 44 into peroxovanadate and H2O. This required mi-
gration of •OOH on the surface to another HOVIV(O)3 site
or desorption/readsorption steps as discussed earlier for oxy-
gen.
H2O2 itself was consumed by different processes, including
reoxidation of HOVIV(O)3, according to

The interaction between O2 and HOV(O)3 in the O2·

ture corresponding to hydrogen transfer could be localized only
on the doublet potential energy surface (27). The energy bar-
rier was 93 kJ/mol lower than the barrier for N2O, and the
free energy barrier at 600 K was 58 kJ/mol lower, demonstrat-
ing that reoxidation of VIV(d1) was much easier by O2 than by
N2O.

3.4. Reoxidation of H2O·VIII(d2) species
Reoxidation of VIII(d2) with O2 and N2O also could proceed
directly from H2O·VIII(O)3 species (see Fig. 3c). The inter-
action between O2 and H2O·V(O)3 (29) was as weak as the
interaction between O2 and V(O)3 (20). The complex 29 had
high-spin (quintet) and low-spin (singlet) states with similar
energies, resulting from two interacting triplets. This complex
evolved toward a superoxovanadate complex 30, with the same
structure and energies in both the triplet and singlet spin states.
This complex could rearrange in a more stable (by 31 kJ/mol)
complex of peroxovanadate with water, 45. Desorption of wa-
ter from 45 to reach peroxovanadate 22 (+H2O) required only
11 kJ/mol. An additional route from 30 was hydrogen trans-
fer from water to oxygen, yielding the •OOH·HOVIV(d1)(O)3,
complex, 32, a biradical that had virtually the same energy in
the triplet and singlet spin states. The transition structure 31
also had the same energy on the triplet and (open-shell) singlet
potential energy surfaces. At about 4 kJ/mol, the energy bar-
rier with respect to 30 was very small, and the energy of 32 was
only marginally higher than that of 30.
The next step along this route was hydrogen transfer from
HOV(O)3 to •OOH leading to the much more stable com-
plex of H2O2 with O=V(O)3, 34. It existed as a singlet, and
the transition structure 33 could be localized only within the
broken-symmetry formalism. At 0.63, S2was much smaller
than 1 (Table 5), indicating strong interaction between the
spins and making spin projection doubtful [21,26,27]. Taking
the broken-symmetry and spin-projected energies as limits, the
low-spin energy of 33 could be estimated as 3024 kJ/mol.
Although the uncertainty is relatively large, the higher value is
still well below the entrance channel of the reaction, indicat-
ing very fast formation of H2O2·O=V(O)3. From this com-
plex, H2O2 could be released (H2O2 + 5 was more stable than
H2O + 22; Table 5), and H2O2 formation indeed was observed
in homogeneous reoxidation of vanadium oxide by O2 [28].
A more stable intermediate H2O·O=V(O)2(OO) (43)
was reached via transition structure 42 if in 34 a hydrogen
atom was transferred from H2O2 to a terminal OH group
in O=V(O)3 at the same time that one OV bond was bro-
ken and another one was formed; that is, OOH became
connected to V, whereas OH was detached as H2O. Re-
arrangement of O=V(O)2(OO) via H transfer and OOV ring
closure through 44 yielded the H2O·peroxovanadate com-
plex 45, which was less stable than the H2O2·vanadate com-
plex 41. From 43, transformation of O=V(O1)(O2)(O3O4)
into O=V(O1O3)(O2)(O4) by oxygen transfer also was pos-
sible, but the energy of the respective transition structure 44a
was much higher than that of 44.
The succession of transition structures and intermediates
was slightly different when the large model 1 was used instead
of 5 (O=V(OH)3). The reaction of H2O2 with O=V(OSi)3
in 1 yielded O=V(OSi)2(OOH)(HOSi), which recombined
to O=V(OSi)2(OOSi) + H2O and further rearranged to
(OO)V(OSi)3 + H2O. With the O=VSi7O12H7 cluster model
1, the energy of O=V(OSi)2(OOSi) was 4 kJ/mol lower than
that of (OO)V(OSi)3. The energy barriers on this pathway
were relatively small, and the reaction could proceed in both
directions depending on concentration; that is, peroxovanadate
also could dissociate into vanadyl and H2O2 when in contact
with H2O.
Fig. 3c (left) and Table 6 show the results for the hydrogen
transfers between H2O·V(O)3 and N2O. N2O was bound more
strongly on H2O·V(O)3 compared with O2 (35). The first hy-
drogen transfer led to a biradical (37). The transition structure

(36), which had a relatively high energy, existed only on the
triplet potential energy surface. N2 was bound to the vanadium
oxide only via van der Waals interactions and could desorb (38).
Van der Waals interactions are poorly described by DFT, ex-
plaining why the energies of 37 and 38 are the same. However,
the free energy gain obtained by releasing N2 from the surface
was so large that N2 desorbed immediately at reaction tempera-
ture even for realistic binding energies. The transition structure
for the subsequent second hydrogen transfer from HOV(O)3
to OH• (39) to yield H2O and O=V(O)3 (40) existed only
on the broken-symmetry surface, as for the O2 reaction path-
way. Both energy and Gibbs free energy barriers are only a
few kJ/mol, indicating that this second hydrogen transfer was
instantaneous. The formation of 40 was strongly exothermic,
and the Gibbs free energies of 40 and 5 shown in Table 6 indi-
cate that water rapidly desorbed from the vanadyl.
Consequently, hydrogen transfers from H2O·V(O)3 to O2
and N2O restoring the vanadyl group were possible and oc-
curred depending on the reaction conditions (particularly water
content). The highest intrinsic energy barrier was calculated for
the reoxidation with N2O. This barrier was higher than that
for the reoxidation of V(O)3 by N2O; that is, reoxidation of
VIII(d2) by N2O dominated the reoxidation of H2O·VIII(d2) by
N2O.
3.5. Peroxovanadate formation
The main difference in the reoxidation of VIII(d2) by N2O
and O2 is that the latter reaction yields peroxovanadate or, for
hydrated sites, H2O2. Consequently, it is particularly impor-
tant to investigate whether peroxovanadate could be generated
through a reaction of vanadyl with N2O. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous theoretical or experimental data are
available; we present results for this reaction in Fig. 6 and
Table 7. The formation of peroxovanadate using N2O can be
safely disregarded because of the high barrier (225 kJ/mol)
connected with transition structure 47.

3.6. Reaction intermediates in ODP with a dimeric VOx
species
We do not know whether vanadium oxide supported on silica
has exclusively monomeric VOx species or if (and under which
conditions) VOx species of higher polymerization degree also
are present [29]. Consequently, we explored the reoxidation of
reduced dimeric vanadium oxide sites (Fig. 7) based on ener-
gies of intermediates given in Table 8. No transition structures
were localized. We assumed that barriers could be similar for
monomeric and dimeric sites.
We used a dimeric vanadium-exchanged silsesquioxane (49)
[29] with a structure derived from 1 (Fig. 2). We considered two
reaction pathways in the ODP reaction [30] (Fig. 7). According
to the first of these pathways, VV(d0)/VV(d0) was reduced to
VIV(d1)/VIV(d1) (50). As discussed in Section 3.3, O2 could

easily reoxidize HOVIV(d1) (27, 45 kJ/mol). The HOO• rad-
ical formed after 27 (Fig. 3b) will immediately react with the
neighboring HOVIV(d1) site with a very low barrier (similarly
as 33, Fig. 3c).
The reoxidation of 50 by N2O was more difficult (Fig. 3b,
24, 138 kJ/mol), and the isomerization of 50 to 51 could com-
pete with it (energy barrier, 146 kJ/mol) [29]. The reoxidation
of 51 by N2O and O2 could occur before or after H2O desorp-
tion. We described the reaction mechanisms in previous sec-
tions. Similar to monomeric vanadium oxide clusters, with O2,
the peroxovanadate 52 could be reached once H2O (formed dur-
ing the ODP) desorbed from VIII(d2). This remained unchanged
regardless of whether vanadium oxide existed as monomeric
species or as dimeric species. The decomposition of 52 into
49 and atomic oxygen gave a reaction energy of 113 kJ/mol
(cf. 109 kJ/mol for 19 into 1 + O).
Finally, we mention the unlikely situation in which both
vanadium sites in the dimer were reduced to VIII(d2) (53). The
intermediate 53 had a much higher energy than the others, and
the catalytic cycle could not reach this situation. Reoxidation
of 53 was similar to that of the monomer. When O2 was the
reoxidizing agent, it replaced H2O, and peroxovanadate was
formed. Reoxidation of the neighboring VIII(d2) by the peroxo-
vanadate site could follow different reaction pathways (after or
before water desorption); all of these processes were quick and
easy, considering the high activity of peroxovanadate. We con-
clude that the presence of dimeric vanadium oxide species on
silica did not significantly alter the reoxidation reaction path-
ways as obtained for the monomeric species. In particular, it
did not affect the differences observed between N2O and O2 as
reoxidizing agents.
3.7. Hydrocarbon activation by peroxovanadate and vanadyl
The main difference between reoxidation of reduced VOx
species by O2 and N2O is that the former can form surface per-
oxovanadate. As shown in Section 3.2, N2O by itself was not
a strong enough oxidant to form peroxovanadate from vanadyl.
Does the presence of peroxovanadate explain the poorer selec-
tivity of O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane? To
gain some insight into this question, we considered the reac-
tion pathways of propane (Section 3.7.1) and propene (Sec-
tion 3.7.2) oxidation by surface vanadyl and peroxovanadate
oxygen species.
Experimental evidence exists [6] demonstrating that the loss
of selectivity in the ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx
species on MCM-41 stems mainly from consecutive oxidation
of primarily formed propene. Thus, the analysis of propene oxi-
dation is of great importance to the design of selective catalytic
materials. On the other hand, propane is the most abundant
species in the system, with a concentration far higher than that
of propene; therefore, the oxidation of propane by vanadyl and
peroxovanadate also was examined.

3.7.1. Activation of propane
It has been shown that surface vanadyl sites can abstract hy-
drogen from propane in a single step [21]. The reaction mech-
anisms and energies given in Fig. 8 and Table 9, respectively,
show that also is true for peroxovanadate sites. After propane
adsorption (55), the peroxo-group abstracted hydrogen from
propane, and a vanadyl group was formed. Examination of the
transition mode in 56 indicates formation of a propyl and a
hydroxyl group, but this intermediate could not be localized
as a stationary point, and its structure immediately evolved to-
ward isopropanol and a vanadyl site (57). The energy barrier
for isopropanol formation was 108 kJ/mol with respect to 55,
demonstrating that the peroxovanadate group was much more
active than the vanadyl group, for which a barrier of 143 kJ/mol
was obtained (59). This finding suggests that peroxovanadate
species will not persist under ODP conditions. The contribu-
tion of different channels to the peroxovanadate decomposition,
such as releasing O2 or reacting with propane, will depend on
the specific reaction conditions. The formation of isopropanol
and vanadyl (57) was strongly exothermic and yielded sufficient
energy to overcome the intrinsic barrier of about 140 kJ/mol for
further oxidation of isopropanol to acetone [22], opening the
path to COx. Isopropanol also can dehydrate if VIII(d2) sites
are available [21].
Because the results for the silsesquioxane model have been
published previously [21], for comparison, Table 9 and Fig. 8
present only the most relevant results for the ODP by vanadyl
sites for the small O=V(OH)3 model. The first hydrogen ab-
straction (59) is the rate-determining step, with an energy bar-
rier of 13310 kJ/mol. It leads to formation of a propyl radical
attached to HOVIV(d1) (60) as a high-energy intermediate that
gives propene and H2O·VIII(d2) via several competitive reac-

tion routes. We mention one of the dominant transition struc-
tures, TS in Table 9 [21,30].
We note that surface HOO•, the primary product of the
reoxidation of HOVIV(d1) sites by O2, also can abstract hy-
drogen from propane, yielding H2O2 and propyl radical (esti-
mated energy barrier, 65 kJ/mol). Thus, both surface vanadyl
and peroxovanadate species are able to activate propane, but
peroxovanadate is more reactive, and the products are differ-
ent (propene and isopropanol, respectively). Isopropanol can be
further oxidized to acetone by the vanadyl group, or it can be-
come dehydrated by VIII(d2).
3.7.2. Activation of propene
The lower part of Fig. 8 shows the mechanisms of the reac-
tions of peroxovanadate and vanadyl sites with propene. Both
yielded propene oxide, but the energy barriers again were much
lower for the peroxovanadate species. The energies of the inter-
mediates and transition structures are reported in Table 10.
The oxidation of propene by a vanadyl group was not an easy
process. After adsorption to the vanadyl group (61), propene
chemisorbed through the broken-symmetry transition struc-
ture 62. The energy barrier of 127  11 kJ/mol was simi-
lar to the barrier for hydrogen abstraction from propane (59;
133  10 kJ/mol). The biradical intermediate 63 converted into
the epoxide with an energy barrier of 176 kJ/mol (64). For-
mation of acetone from 63 required overcoming an even higher
barrier. The conversion of propene to propene oxide (65) was
endothermic. In contrast, the conversion of propene by perox-
ovanadate was strongly exothermic (68; 250 kJ/mol). After
propene adsorption onto the peroxovanadate species (66), oxy-
gen transfer (67) led immediately to propene oxide and a
vanadyl species (68) with a barrier of only 93 kJ/mol.
To summarize, peroxovanadate and vanadyl can oxidize
propene to propene oxide; however, peroxovanadate does it
with a significantly lower energy barrier. Whatever species
it comes in contact with (be it propene, propane, or water),
that species is oxidized, and vanadyl is restored. Formation of

propene oxide is strongly exothermic, opening the route to the

4. Discussion
Fig. 9 shows a simplified scheme of ODP product formation
in the presence of O2 and N2O as emerging from the present
DFT calculations (Fig. 9). The numbers given are the calculated
energy/Gibbs free energy barriers (600 K) for the initial steps
leading to the respective products. Independent of the oxidizing
agent (O2 or N2O), C3H6 is formed by successive abstraction of
two H atoms from C3H8 by VOx species, which are reduced in
the process. This agrees with previous experiments on the ODP
reaction over various vanadium-based catalytic materials [5,31
37]. DFT calculations suggest the involvement of the vanadyl
oxygen atom of VOx species in the rate-determining step of
propane activation [21,30] and also, as we have shown, in the
further oxidation of propene, ultimately yielding COx species.
Reoxidation of the reduced VOx species is shown in the
lower part of Fig. 9. According to the DFT calculations dis-
cussed in Sections 3.23.4, O2 can easily oxidize vanadium
+III and +IV species, whereas N2O reoxidizes vanadium +III
species. The significantly higher barriers demonstrate that N2O
is a less-reactive oxidizing agent than O2. This theoretical result
agrees with an earlier experimental kinetic analysis of reoxida-
tion of reduced VOx species over VOx (2.7 wt%)/MCM-41 by
O2 and N2O [38] and demonstrates that the rates of propane
consumption and propene formation over VOx/MCM-41 [6]
and VOx/γ -Al2O3 [5] are lower with N2O than with O2.
N2O and O2 also differ in terms of the nature of oxygen
species formed on reoxidation of reduced VOx species. N2O se-
lectively restores vanadyl oxygen in the reduced VOx species,
whereas O2 can form peroxovanadates, which then decompose
into vanadyl and oxygen. The latter can oxidize another vana-
dium +III or +IV site after either migration over the surface
[40] or desorption/readsorption of oxygen.
These results are supported by a joint experimentalcomputa-
tional study [25] that reported formation of peroxovanadate on
exposure of a (reduced) V2O3 (0001) surface to molecular oxy-
gen at low temperature (90 K) under UHV conditions. Under
these conditions, the surface exhibited VIII sites. The peroxo
groups decomposed into vanadyl groups between 170 K and
room temperature.
It is important to stress that peroxovanadate is active for both
propane and propene oxidation, and at the temperatures consid-
ered here (600800 K), the oxidation rate is one to two orders of
magnitude larger for propene than for propane at the same con-
centrations. Under these conditions, propene oxidation is 48
times slower than propane oxidation on vanadyl sites. The find-
ing that the catalysts capability for consecutive C3H6 oxidation
to COx is significantly reduced when N2O instead of O2 is used
as the oxidizing agent can be understood by keeping in mind
that N2O cannot form peroxovanadate. As shown in Fig. 9, the
route of COx formation via propene reaction with peroxovana-
dates disappeares in the presence of N2O.
Our theoretical results agree well with experimental obser-
vations. COx formed in the ODP reaction over VO (2.7 wt%)/
MCM-41 stems mainly from consecutive propene oxidation
[6,38]. Experimentally, direct propane oxidation to COx plays
a minor role, and the catalysts capability for consecutive C3H6
oxidation to COx is strongly reduced on replacement of O2 with
N2O.
5. Conclusion
According to our calculations, different oxidants in the ODP
reaction on supported vanadium oxide catalysts not only in-
fluence the degree of reduction of the VOx species, but also
may generate different concentrations of selective vanadyl and
nonselective peroxo species, as illustrated in Fig. 9 for O2 and
N2O. Propene is formed primarily from propane via oxidative
dehydrogenation by lattice (vanadyl) oxygen of VOx species.
Vanadyl oxygen also is active for consecutive propene oxida-
tion. Vanadyl groups can be restored via reoxidation by O2 and
N2O. N2O is less active and can oxidize VIII sites only, whereas
O2 can oxidize both VIII and VIV. Only in the case of reoxida-
tion by O2 is the vanadyl oxygen species reached via a per-
oxovanadate precursor. The latter is more reactive for propene
oxidation (leading to COx) compared with vanadyl species.
