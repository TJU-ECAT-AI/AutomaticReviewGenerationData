The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. CeO2 has been identified as the most promising support material due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

These insights suggest that the reaction mechanism involves the activation of CO2 on the support material, while the Fe oxide provides active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane. The combination of Fe with CeO2 creates a synergistic effect that enhances catalytic performance and stability.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, researchers should focus on:
1. Developing Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts with controlled Fe loading to balance CO2 activation and propane dehydrogenation.
2. Exploiting the oxygen mobility and OSC properties of ceria to maintain catalyst stability and prevent deactivation.
3. Investigating the interaction between Fe and Ce in the catalyst structure to maximize the synergistic effects.
4. Exploring other reducible support materials that may offer similar or improved CO2 activation properties.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。CeO2被认为是最有前景的载体材料，因为它能够通过直接C=O键裂解来活化CO2。基于铈的催化剂的氧移动性和氧储存容量(OSC)有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点。

这些见解表明，反应机理涉及在载体材料上活化CO2，而Fe氧化物提供丙烷脱氢的活性位点。Fe与CeO2的组合产生了协同效应，增强了催化性能和稳定性。

为了优化这一过程的催化系统，研究人员应该关注：
1. 开发Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂，控制Fe负载量，以平衡CO2活化和丙烷脱氢。
2. 利用氧化铈的氧移动性和OSC特性来保持催化剂稳定性并防止失活。
3. 研究催化剂结构中Fe和Ce之间的相互作用，以最大化协同效应。
4. 探索其他可能提供类似或更优CO2活化性能的可还原载体材料。
