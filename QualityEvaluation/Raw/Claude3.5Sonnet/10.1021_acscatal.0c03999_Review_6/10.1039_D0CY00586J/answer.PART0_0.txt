[1] "The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding imporved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems."

[2] "It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified."

[3] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."

[4] "Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support material provides improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity, which contributes to the stability of the catalytic systems. The formation of Fe-Ce solid solutions, where Fe ions substitute Ce ions in the lattice, enhances the propane ODH pathway at higher Fe/Ce ratios while suppressing propane cracking.

These insights suggest that the reaction mechanism likely involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the CeO2 support, facilitated by the presence of Fe ions. The improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity of CeO2 allow for efficient oxygen transfer to active sites, while the Fe ions may play a role in activating CO2 and propane.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, a balance must be struck between Fe loading and stability. Higher Fe/Ce ratios enhance the ODH pathway, but excessive Fe loading can lead to deactivation through CeO2 sintering and Fe migration. Lower Fe loadings may result in coke deposition. Therefore, an optimal Fe loading should be determined to maximize catalytic performance while maintaining stability.

Additionally, the formation of a single-phase Fe-Ce solid solution appears to be crucial for catalytic performance, as opposed to separate Fe and Ce oxide phases. This suggests that catalyst preparation methods should focus on achieving uniform Fe distribution within the CeO2 lattice.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。使用CeO2作为支撑材料可提供改善的氧移动性和氧储存能力，这有助于催化系统的稳定性。Fe-Ce固溶体的形成，即Fe离子替代晶格中的Ce离子，在较高的Fe/Ce比率下增强了丙烷ODH途径，同时抑制了丙烷裂解。

这些见解表明，反应机理可能涉及来自CeO2支撑材料的晶格氧的参与，这一过程由Fe离子的存在所促进。CeO2改善的氧移动性和储存能力允许氧高效地转移到活性位点，而Fe离子可能在活化CO2和丙烷方面发挥作用。

为了优化这一过程的催化系统，必须在Fe负载量和稳定性之间取得平衡。较高的Fe/Ce比率可以增强ODH途径，但过多的Fe负载可能导致CeO2烧结和Fe迁移而失活。较低的Fe负载可能导致积碳。因此，应确定最佳Fe负载量，以最大化催化性能同时保持稳定性。

此外，形成单相Fe-Ce固溶体对催化性能似乎至关重要，而不是分离的Fe和Ce氧化物相。这表明催化剂制备方法应该注重在CeO2晶格中实现均匀的Fe分布。
