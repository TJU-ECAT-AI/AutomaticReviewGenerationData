[1] "The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding imporved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems."

[2] "It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified."

[3] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."

[4] "Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support material provides improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity, which contributes to the stability of the catalytic systems. The formation of Fe-Ce solid solutions, where Fe ions substitute Ce ions in the lattice, enhances the propane ODH pathway at higher Fe/Ce ratios while suppressing propane cracking.

These insights suggest that the reaction mechanism likely involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the CeO2 support, facilitated by the presence of Fe ions. The improved oxygen mobility and storage capacity of CeO2 allow for efficient oxygen transfer to active sites, while the Fe ions may play a role in activating CO2 and propane.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, a balance must be struck between Fe loading and stability. Higher Fe/Ce ratios enhance the ODH pathway, but excessive Fe loading can lead to deactivation through CeO2 sintering and Fe migration. Lower Fe loadings may result in coke deposition. Therefore, an optimal Fe loading should be determined to maximize catalytic performance while maintaining stability.

Additionally, the formation of a single-phase Fe-Ce solid solution appears to be crucial for catalytic performance, as opposed to separate Fe and Ce oxide phases. This suggests that catalyst preparation methods should focus on achieving uniform Fe distribution within the CeO2 lattice.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。使用CeO2作为支撑材料可提供改善的氧移动性和氧储存能力，这有助于催化系统的稳定性。Fe-Ce固溶体的形成，即Fe离子替代晶格中的Ce离子，在较高的Fe/Ce比率下增强了丙烷ODH途径，同时抑制了丙烷裂解。

这些见解表明，反应机理可能涉及来自CeO2支撑材料的晶格氧的参与，这一过程由Fe离子的存在所促进。CeO2改善的氧移动性和储存能力允许氧高效地转移到活性位点，而Fe离子可能在活化CO2和丙烷方面发挥作用。

为了优化这一过程的催化系统，必须在Fe负载量和稳定性之间取得平衡。较高的Fe/Ce比率可以增强ODH途径，但过多的Fe负载可能导致CeO2烧结和Fe迁移而失活。较低的Fe负载可能导致积碳。因此，应确定最佳Fe负载量，以最大化催化性能同时保持稳定性。

此外，形成单相Fe-Ce固溶体对催化性能似乎至关重要，而不是分离的Fe和Ce氧化物相。这表明催化剂制备方法应该注重在CeO2晶格中实现均匀的Fe分布。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. CeO2 has been identified as the most promising support material due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves competitive pathways such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), reverse water gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. These pathways can be tuned by carefully selecting the bimetallic composition of active sites. For instance, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

These insights suggest that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on:

1. Using CeO2 as a support material to enhance CO2 activation.
2. Tailoring the bimetallic composition to control the balance between different reaction pathways.
3. Leveraging the oxygen mobility and storage capacity of ceria-based catalysts to maintain stable active sites.
4. Considering the specific bond-breaking preferences of different metal combinations (e.g., Fe-Ni vs. Pt-containing surfaces) to optimize selectivity towards desired products.

By carefully considering these factors, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有重大影响。CeO2被确定为最有前景的载体材料，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。基于氧化铈的催化剂的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点。

反应机理涉及竞争性途径，如氧化脱氢(ODH)、逆水煤气反应和烷烃干重整。这些途径可以通过仔细选择活性位点的双金属组成来调节。例如，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt决定的表面有利于C-C键断裂。

这些见解表明，优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统应该关注：

1. 使用CeO2作为载体材料来增强CO2的活化。
2. 调整双金属组成以控制不同反应途径之间的平衡。
3. 利用基于氧化铈的催化剂的氧移动性和储存能力来维持稳定的活性位点。
4. 考虑不同金属组合的特定键断裂偏好（例如Fe-Ni与含Pt表面），以优化对目标产物的选择性。

通过仔细考虑这些因素，研究人员可以开发出更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，用于CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. 

CeO2 appears to be a particularly promising support material due to its improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC). These properties contribute to the synthesis of stable catalytic systems. CeO2 also shows the ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission, which is beneficial for the reaction.

Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts with moderate Fe loading demonstrated stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours. This suggests that the Fe-CeO2 combination can create active and stable catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

The deactivation mechanisms vary depending on Fe loading. Low Fe catalysts deactivate primarily due to coke deposition, while high Fe loading catalysts suffer from CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals.

These insights provide valuable information for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP. The ideal catalyst should balance Fe loading to maximize activity and stability while minimizing deactivation mechanisms. The use of CeO2 as a support material appears crucial due to its beneficial properties in activating CO2 and maintaining catalyst stability.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the interplay between the Fe active sites and the CeO2 support. The Fe sites may be responsible for C-H bond activation in propane, while the CeO2 support aids in CO2 activation and oxygen mobility. This synergistic effect contributes to the overall performance of the catalyst in CO2-ODHP reactions.

CeO2作为支撑材料表现出特别有前景,这是由于其改善的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)。这些性质有助于合成稳定的催化体系。CeO2还显示出通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2的能力,这对反应有利。

具有适度Fe负载量的Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂表现出长达20小时的稳定丙烷转化和丙烯选择性。这表明Fe-CeO2组合可以创造出活性和稳定性俱佳的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂。

失活机理因Fe负载量而异。低Fe催化剂主要由于积碳而失活,而高Fe负载量催化剂则因CeO2烧结和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体而失活。

这些见解为优化CO2-ODHP的催化体系提供了宝贵信息。理想的催化剂应平衡Fe负载量,以最大化活性和稳定性,同时最小化失活机理。使用CeO2作为支撑材料似乎至关重要,因为它在活化CO2和维持催化剂稳定性方面具有有益的特性。

反应机理可能涉及Fe活性位点和CeO2支撑材料之间的相互作用。Fe位点可能负责丙烷中C-H键的活化,而CeO2支撑材料则有助于CO2的活化和氧的移动。这种协同效应有助于催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体性能。
