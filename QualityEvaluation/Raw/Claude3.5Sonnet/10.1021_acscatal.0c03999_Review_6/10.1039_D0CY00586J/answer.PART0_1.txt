The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. CeO2 has been identified as the most promising support material due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves competitive pathways such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), reverse water gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. These pathways can be tuned by carefully selecting the bimetallic composition of active sites. For instance, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

These insights suggest that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on:

1. Using CeO2 as a support material to enhance CO2 activation.
2. Tailoring the bimetallic composition to control the balance between different reaction pathways.
3. Leveraging the oxygen mobility and storage capacity of ceria-based catalysts to maintain stable active sites.
4. Considering the specific bond-breaking preferences of different metal combinations (e.g., Fe-Ni vs. Pt-containing surfaces) to optimize selectivity towards desired products.

By carefully considering these factors, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有重大影响。CeO2被确定为最有前景的载体材料，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。基于氧化铈的催化剂的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点。

反应机理涉及竞争性途径，如氧化脱氢(ODH)、逆水煤气反应和烷烃干重整。这些途径可以通过仔细选择活性位点的双金属组成来调节。例如，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt决定的表面有利于C-C键断裂。

这些见解表明，优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统应该关注：

1. 使用CeO2作为载体材料来增强CO2的活化。
2. 调整双金属组成以控制不同反应途径之间的平衡。
3. 利用基于氧化铈的催化剂的氧移动性和储存能力来维持稳定的活性位点。
4. 考虑不同金属组合的特定键断裂偏好（例如Fe-Ni与含Pt表面），以优化对目标产物的选择性。

通过仔细考虑这些因素，研究人员可以开发出更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，用于CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。
