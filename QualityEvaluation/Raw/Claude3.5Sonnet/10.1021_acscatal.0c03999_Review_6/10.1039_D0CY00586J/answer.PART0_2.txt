The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. 

CeO2 appears to be a particularly promising support material due to its improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC). These properties contribute to the synthesis of stable catalytic systems. CeO2 also shows the ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission, which is beneficial for the reaction.

Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts with moderate Fe loading demonstrated stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours. This suggests that the Fe-CeO2 combination can create active and stable catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

The deactivation mechanisms vary depending on Fe loading. Low Fe catalysts deactivate primarily due to coke deposition, while high Fe loading catalysts suffer from CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals.

These insights provide valuable information for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP. The ideal catalyst should balance Fe loading to maximize activity and stability while minimizing deactivation mechanisms. The use of CeO2 as a support material appears crucial due to its beneficial properties in activating CO2 and maintaining catalyst stability.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the interplay between the Fe active sites and the CeO2 support. The Fe sites may be responsible for C-H bond activation in propane, while the CeO2 support aids in CO2 activation and oxygen mobility. This synergistic effect contributes to the overall performance of the catalyst in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。

CeO2作为支撑材料表现出特别有前景,这是由于其改善的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)。这些性质有助于合成稳定的催化体系。CeO2还显示出通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2的能力,这对反应有利。

具有适度Fe负载量的Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂表现出长达20小时的稳定丙烷转化和丙烯选择性。这表明Fe-CeO2组合可以创造出活性和稳定性俱佳的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂。

失活机理因Fe负载量而异。低Fe催化剂主要由于积碳而失活,而高Fe负载量催化剂则因CeO2烧结和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体而失活。

这些见解为优化CO2-ODHP的催化体系提供了宝贵信息。理想的催化剂应平衡Fe负载量,以最大化活性和稳定性,同时最小化失活机理。使用CeO2作为支撑材料似乎至关重要,因为它在活化CO2和维持催化剂稳定性方面具有有益的特性。

反应机理可能涉及Fe活性位点和CeO2支撑材料之间的相互作用。Fe位点可能负责丙烷中C-H键的活化,而CeO2支撑材料则有助于CO2的活化和氧的移动。这种协同效应有助于催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的整体性能。
