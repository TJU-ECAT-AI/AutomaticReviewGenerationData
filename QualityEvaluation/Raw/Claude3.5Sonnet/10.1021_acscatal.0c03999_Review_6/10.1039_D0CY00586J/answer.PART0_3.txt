The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. CeO2 was found to be the most promising support material due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. This suggests that the support plays a crucial role in CO2 activation, which is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

The bimetallic composition of active sites was shown to tune the competitive reaction pathways, including ODH, reverse water gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. This implies that the reducibility of the catalyst, which is influenced by its composition, affects the reaction selectivity.

DFT calculations revealed that Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond breaking, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage. This provides insight into how the catalyst composition influences the reaction mechanism at the molecular level.

These findings suggest that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions should focus on:
1. Using CeO2 as a support material to enhance CO2 activation
2. Carefully selecting bimetallic compositions to tune reaction selectivity
3. Considering the balance between C-H and C-C bond activation based on the desired products

The insights into the reaction mechanism highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between catalyst reducibility, support materials, and active site composition in designing effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和载体材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。CeO2被发现是最有前景的载体材料，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来激活CO2。这表明载体在CO2活化中起着关键作用，而CO2活化是反应机理中的一个关键步骤。

活性位点的双金属组成被证明可以调节竞争性反应途径，包括ODH、逆水气变换和烷烃干重整。这意味着催化剂的还原性（受其组成影响）会影响反应选择性。

DFT计算揭示Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt决定的表面有利于C-C键断裂。这为催化剂组成如何在分子水平上影响反应机理提供了洞见。

这些发现表明，优化CO2-ODHP反应的催化系统应关注：
1. 使用CeO2作为载体材料以增强CO2活化
2. 仔细选择双金属组成以调节反应选择性
3. 根据所需产品考虑C-H和C-C键活化之间的平衡

对反应机理的洞察强调了在设计有效的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂时，理解催化剂还原性、载体材料和活性位点组成之间相互作用的重要性。
