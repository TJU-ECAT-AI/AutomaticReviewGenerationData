Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, their reducibility, or support materials for CO2-ODHP reactions. The text focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on active carbon for propane dehydrogenation with CO2. It does not discuss iron oxide catalysts or provide insights into the reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP specifically. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于Fe氧化物基催化剂、它们的可还原性或CO2-ODHP反应的载体材料的任何信息。该文本主要讨论了以活性炭为载体的氧化铬催化剂用于含CO2的丙烷脱氢反应。它没有讨论氧化铁催化剂，也没有提供关于CO2-ODHP反应机理的见解。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, their reducibility, or support materials for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) reactions. The document primarily discusses chromium oxide catalysts supported on active carbon for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. There is no mention of iron oxide catalysts or their properties in relation to CO2-ODHP reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given information.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献中没有关于Fe氧化物基催化剂、其还原性或CO2-ODHP(丙烷氧化脱氢)反应的支撑材料的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了活性炭负载的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应。文中没有提到铁氧化物催化剂或它们与CO2-ODHP反应相关的性质。因此,无法根据给定信息回答这个问题。
