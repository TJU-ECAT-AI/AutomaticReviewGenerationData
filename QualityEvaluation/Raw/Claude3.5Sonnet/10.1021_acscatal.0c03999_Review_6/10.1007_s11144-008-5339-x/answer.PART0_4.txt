The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The addition of Nb-doped HZSM-5 with varying Nb content effectively improves catalytic performance. Catalytic activity and product selectivity increase with Nb content up to 15 wt%, after which they slightly decrease. This improvement is attributed to enhanced catalyst reducibility and an increased number of acid sites with appropriate strength. The formation of Nb-O-Si linkages in Nb-doped catalysts helps stabilize active sites and prevent sintering during the reaction.

These findings provide insights into the reaction mechanism, suggesting that the reducibility of the catalyst and the presence of appropriate acid sites play crucial roles in the CO2-ODHP process. The stabilization of active sites through Nb-O-Si linkages indicates the importance of preventing catalyst degradation during the reaction. To optimize catalytic systems for this process, researchers should focus on tailoring the support material composition and dopant content to achieve an optimal balance of reducibility, acidity, and stability.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。添加不同Nb含量的Nb掺杂HZSM-5能有效提高催化性能。催化活性和产物选择性随Nb含量增加而增加，直至15 wt%，之后略有下降。这种改进归因于催化剂可还原性的增强和适当强度酸性位数量的增加。Nb掺杂催化剂中Nb-O-Si链接的形成有助于稳定活性位点并防止反应过程中的烧结。

这些发现为反应机理提供了见解，表明催化剂的可还原性和适当酸性位的存在在CO2-ODHP过程中起着关键作用。通过Nb-O-Si链接稳定活性位点表明防止催化剂在反应过程中降解的重要性。为优化该过程的催化系统，研究人员应专注于调整载体材料组成和掺杂剂含量，以实现可还原性、酸度和稳定性的最佳平衡。
