The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The addition of Pd to Fe2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts improves their catalytic activity, with an optimal Pd loading of around 15 wt%. This enhancement is attributed to a synergistic effect between Pd and Fe2O3, which increases the reducibility of the catalysts and promotes the activation of both CO2 and propane.

These findings provide insights into the reaction mechanism, suggesting that the ability of the catalyst to activate both reactants (CO2 and propane) is crucial for improved performance. The synergistic effect between Pd and Fe2O3 likely creates more active sites or lowers the activation energy for the reaction.

For optimizing catalytic systems in this process, the results indicate that:

1. Careful selection of support materials (such as HZSM-5) is important.
2. Incorporating noble metals like Pd can significantly enhance catalyst performance.
3. The loading of the noble metal should be optimized, as too little or too much can lead to suboptimal performance.
4. Improving the reducibility of the catalyst is a key factor in enhancing its activity.

These insights can guide future catalyst design for CO2-ODHP reactions, focusing on creating multi-component systems that maximize synergistic effects and optimize reducibility.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。向Fe2O3/HZSM-5催化剂中添加Pd可以改善其催化活性，最佳Pd负载量约为15 wt%。这种增强效果归因于Pd和Fe2O3之间的协同作用，它提高了催化剂的可还原性，并促进了CO2和丙烷的活化。

这些发现为反应机理提供了洞见，表明催化剂活化两种反应物（CO2和丙烷）的能力对于提高性能至关重要。Pd和Fe2O3之间的协同作用可能创造了更多的活性位点或降低了反应的活化能。

为优化此过程的催化系统，结果表明：

1. 仔细选择载体材料（如HZSM-5）很重要。
2. 引入贵金属（如Pd）可显著提高催化剂性能。
3. 贵金属的负载量应该优化，因为太少或太多都会导致性能不佳。
4. 提高催化剂的可还原性是增强其活性的关键因素。

这些见解可以指导未来CO2-ODHP反应的催化剂设计，重点是创建多组分系统，以最大化协同效应并优化可还原性。
