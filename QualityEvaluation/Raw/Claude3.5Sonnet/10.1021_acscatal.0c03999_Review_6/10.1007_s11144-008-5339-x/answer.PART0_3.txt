The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of Pt as a support material enhances the reducibility of the catalysts, which in turn improves their catalytic performance. This increased reducibility is directly related to the enhancement of catalytic activity and selectivity.

The improved performance can be attributed to the facilitated generation of oxygen vacancies due to the increased reducibility. This insight suggests that the reaction mechanism likely involves the creation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes, focus should be placed on enhancing the reducibility of the catalysts. This can be achieved by incorporating suitable support materials, such as Pt, which promote the formation of oxygen vacancies and improve overall catalytic performance.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。Pt作为支持材料的存在增强了催化剂的可还原性，从而提高了其催化性能。这种增加的可还原性直接关系到催化活性和选择性的提高。

性能的改善可以归因于由于可还原性增加而促进的氧空位的生成。这一见解表明，反应机理可能涉及催化剂表面氧空位的创建和利用。

为了优化CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统，应该将重点放在提高催化剂的可还原性上。这可以通过incorporation合适的支持材料（如Pt）来实现，这些材料可以促进氧空位的形成并提高整体催化性能。
