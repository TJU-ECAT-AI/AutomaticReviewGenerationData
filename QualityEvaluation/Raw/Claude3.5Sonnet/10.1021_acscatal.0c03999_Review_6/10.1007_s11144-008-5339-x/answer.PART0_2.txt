The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts plays a crucial role in their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The conversion of CO2 is more closely related to the reducibility of the catalysts than their surface area. This suggests that the active sites for CO2 activation are metallic Fe species that are reduced from iron oxide during the reaction.

The support materials also influence catalyst performance. The addition of Ag as a promoter enhances CO2 conversion by facilitating the reduction of iron oxide, leading to the formation of more active sites.

These insights provide valuable information about the reaction mechanism and potential strategies for optimizing catalytic systems. The proposed mechanism involves the reduction of iron oxide to form metallic Fe species, which serve as active sites for CO2 activation. To improve catalyst performance, efforts should focus on enhancing the reducibility of the iron oxide and incorporating promoters that facilitate this reduction process.

Optimizing the catalytic system for CO2-ODHP reactions may involve:
1. Selecting support materials that promote the reducibility of iron oxide
2. Incorporating promoters like Ag that enhance the formation of active sites
3. Fine-tuning the catalyst composition to balance reducibility and stability
4. Optimizing reaction conditions to favor the formation and maintenance of active metallic Fe species

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能中起着至关重要的作用。CO2的转化与催化剂的可还原性比其表面积更密切相关。这表明CO2活化的活性位点是反应过程中从氧化铁还原而来的金属Fe物种。

载体材料也影响催化剂性能。添加Ag作为助剂可以通过促进氧化铁的还原来增强CO2的转化，从而形成更多的活性位点。

这些见解为反应机理和优化该过程的催化系统提供了宝贵的信息。提出的机理涉及氧化铁还原形成金属Fe物种，这些物种作为CO2活化的活性位点。为了提高催化剂性能，应该集中精力增强氧化铁的可还原性，并引入促进这一还原过程的助剂。

优化CO2-ODHP反应的催化系统可能包括：
1. 选择促进氧化铁可还原性的载体材料
2. 引入像Ag这样的助剂，以增强活性位点的形成
3. 微调催化剂组成，以平衡可还原性和稳定性
4. 优化反应条件，有利于活性金属Fe物种的形成和维持
