[1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[2] "The activation of CO2 for chromium-based catalysts is typically attributed to a Cr6+ active center generated from a redox cycle with Cr3+."

[3] "Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 would fill the vacancy."

[4] "Apart from CO2 filling vacancies or providing lattice oxygen, the exchange over CeO2 can also provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression."

[5] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of readily reducible oxides like CeO2 as support materials is crucial for CO2 activation due to their ability to reversibly convert between oxidation states (Ce4+ and Ce3+) and their oxygen exchange properties. This reducibility facilitates CO2 adsorption and activation, which is a critical step in the CO2-ODHP process.

The structure of the support material, particularly its vacancy geometry, plays a vital role in determining how CO2 interacts with the catalyst surface. The adsorption configuration of CO2 on the support surface dictates the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. Additionally, the oxygen exchange properties of supports like CeO2 can provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression, which is important for maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

For Fe oxide-based catalysts, the oxidation state of Fe is crucial for promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. In the case of Fe3Ni1 catalysts, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions has been found to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage, which is key to the CO2-ODHP mechanism. This suggests that maintaining Fe in an oxidized state is important for selectivity towards the desired CO2-ODHP products.

These insights into the role of reducibility and support materials provide valuable guidance for optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP. They suggest that ideal catalysts should combine readily reducible supports with Fe oxide species that can maintain an appropriate oxidation state under reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst design should consider the interplay between the metal oxide and the support to create optimal adsorption sites and oxygen exchange properties for CO2 activation and subsequent reaction steps.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能有显著影响。使用像CeO2这样易还原的氧化物作为载体材料对CO2活化至关重要，这是由于它们能够在氧化态之间可逆转换（Ce4+和Ce3+）以及它们的氧交换特性。这种可还原性有助于CO2的吸附和活化，这是CO2-ODHP过程中的关键步骤。

载体材料的结构，特别是其空位几何结构，在决定CO2如何与催化剂表面相互作用方面起着至关重要的作用。CO2在载体表面上的吸附构型决定了CO2还原的机理和能量学。此外，像CeO2这样的载体的氧交换特性可以提供晶格氧用于抑制积碳，这对于维持催化剂的稳定性和活性很重要。

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂，Fe的氧化态对促进CO2-ODHP途径至关重要。在Fe3Ni1催化剂的情况下，反应条件下氧化Fe的存在被发现有利于氧化性C-H键断裂，这是CO2-ODHP机理的关键。这表明保持Fe在氧化态对于向所需的CO2-ODHP产物的选择性很重要。

这些关于可还原性和载体材料作用的见解为优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统提供了宝贵的指导。它们表明，理想的催化剂应该结合易还原的载体和能在反应条件下保持适当氧化态的Fe氧化物物种。此外，催化剂设计应考虑金属氧化物和载体之间的相互作用，以创造最佳的吸附位点和氧交换特性，用于CO2活化和后续反应步骤。
