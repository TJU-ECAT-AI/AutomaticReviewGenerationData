          [1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[2] "Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 would fill the vacancy."

[3] "Apart from CO2 filling vacancies or providing lattice oxygen, the exchange over CeO2 can also provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression."

[4] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[5] "CeO2 has the ability to accommodate high oxygen vacancy concentrations without a change in crystallographic structure even at high temperatures."

[6] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Key insights include:

1. Reducibility of support: CeO2 is an ideal support material due to its ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, facilitating oxygen exchange critical for CO2 activation. It can accommodate high oxygen vacancy concentrations without structural changes, even at high temperatures.

2. Structure dependence: The effectiveness of CO2 adsorption on ceria surfaces is structure-dependent. The adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction, with vacancy geometry determining if CO2 fills the vacancy.

3. Oxidation state of Fe: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests maintaining Fe in an oxidized state is important for selectivity.

4. Synergistic effects: In bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni1, the interplay between metallic Ni and oxidized Fe is important. Fe tends to segregate to the surface in the presence of oxygen due to stronger Fe-O bonds compared to Ni-O.

5. Coke suppression: The oxygen exchange properties of CeO2 can provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression, enhancing catalyst stability.

These insights suggest that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on:
- Using reducible supports like CeO2 to facilitate oxygen exchange and CO2 activation.
- Controlling the oxidation state of Fe to maintain it in an oxidized form during the reaction.
- Tailoring the surface structure to optimize CO2 adsorption and subsequent reaction steps.
- Balancing the composition of bimetallic catalysts to leverage the beneficial properties of each component.
- Enhancing coke resistance through careful selection and design of the support material.

By considering these factors, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and stable catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

          Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。主要见解包括：

1. 载体的可还原性：CeO2是理想的载体材料，因为它能够在Ce4+和Ce3+之间可逆转换，促进了对CO2活化至关重要的氧交换。它可以在高温下容纳高浓度的氧空位而不改变晶体结构。

2. 结构依赖性：CO2在氧化铈表面的有效吸附取决于结构。吸附构型决定了CO2还原的机理和能量学，空位几何结构决定了CO2是否填充空位。

3. Fe的氧化态：反应条件下氧化Fe的存在对于通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化性C-H键断裂至关重要。这表明保持Fe处于氧化态对选择性很重要。

4. 协同效应：在Fe3Ni1等双金属催化剂中，金属Ni和氧化Fe之间的相互作用很重要。由于Fe-O键比Ni-O键更强，Fe倾向于在有氧存在时偏析到表面。

5. 抑制积碳：CeO2的氧交换特性可以提供晶格氧以抑制积碳，提高催化剂稳定性。

这些见解表明，优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统应该关注：
- 使用像CeO2这样的可还原载体来促进氧交换和CO2活化。
- 控制Fe的氧化态，使其在反应过程中保持氧化形式。
- 调整表面结构以优化CO2吸附和后续反应步骤。
- 平衡双金属催化剂的组成，以利用每个组分的有益特性。
- 通过仔细选择和设计载体材料来增强抗积碳能力。

通过考虑这些因素，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效、更稳定的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂。
