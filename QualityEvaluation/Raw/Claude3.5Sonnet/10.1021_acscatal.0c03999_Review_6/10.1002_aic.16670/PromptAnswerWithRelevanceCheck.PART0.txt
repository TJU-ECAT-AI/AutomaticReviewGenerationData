[1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[2] "Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 would fill the vacancy."

[3] "Apart from CO2 filling vacancies or providing lattice oxygen, the exchange over CeO2 can also provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression."

[4] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support material is particularly beneficial due to its readily reducible nature and ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states. This property enables efficient oxygen exchange, which is crucial for CO2 activation.

The structure of the ceria surface affects CO2 adsorption, which in turn influences the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process can weaken the C-O bond, while the vacancy geometry determines whether CO2 fills the vacancy. Additionally, the oxygen exchange over CeO2 can provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression, improving catalyst stability.

For Fe oxide-based catalysts, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This is evidenced by the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions.

These insights suggest that the CO2-ODHP mechanism involves the interaction between the reducible support (CeO2) and the oxidized Fe species. The support facilitates CO2 activation and provides oxygen mobility, while the oxidized Fe promotes C-H bond cleavage. To optimize catalytic systems for this process, it is crucial to maintain the oxidized state of Fe while utilizing a reducible support like CeO2 that can efficiently activate CO2 and suppress coke formation.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。使用CeO2作为载体材料特别有利，因为它具有易还原性，能够在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间可逆转换。这一特性使得氧交换效率高，对CO2的活化至关重要。

氧化铈表面的结构影响CO2的吸附，进而影响CO2还原的机理和能量学。吸附过程可以削弱C-O键，而空位几何结构决定了CO2是否填充空位。此外，CeO2上的氧交换可以提供晶格氧以抑制积碳，提高催化剂稳定性。

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂，在反应条件下氧化Fe的存在是通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化性C-H键断裂的关键。Fe3Ni1催化剂在反应条件下由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，证实了这一点。

这些见解表明，CO2-ODHP机理涉及可还原载体（CeO2）和氧化Fe物种之间的相互作用。载体促进CO2的活化并提供氧的移动性，而氧化Fe促进C-H键的断裂。为了优化这一过程的催化系统，保持Fe的氧化状态并使用像CeO2这样的可还原载体至关重要，因为它可以有效地活化CO2并抑制积碳形成。

The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts and the choice of support material significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support is particularly beneficial due to its ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, which facilitates oxygen exchange and CO2 activation. This redox property of CeO2 is critical for the overall reaction mechanism.

The structure of the catalyst surface, particularly the adsorption sites on CeO2, plays a crucial role in determining the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. This suggests that careful control of the catalyst structure can optimize its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

For Fe-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Fe3Ni1, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring the oxidative C-H bond cleavage pathway in CO2-ODHP. This indicates that maintaining Fe in an oxidized state is crucial for selectivity towards propylene formation.

The strong Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O leads to Fe segregation to the surface in the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation. This surface segregation of oxidized Fe likely plays a critical role in the reaction mechanism, potentially providing active sites for C-H bond activation.

These insights suggest that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on:
1. Using reducible supports like CeO2 to facilitate oxygen exchange and CO2 activation.
2. Controlling the oxidation state of Fe to maintain it in an oxidized form during the reaction.
3. Tailoring the surface structure to optimize CO2 adsorption and subsequent reaction steps.
4. Balancing the composition of bimetallic catalysts to leverage the beneficial properties of each component, such as the oxidized Fe for C-H activation and metallic Ni for other reaction steps.

催化剂表面的结构，特别是CeO2上的吸附位，在决定CO2还原的机理和能量学方面起着关键作用。这表明仔细控制催化剂结构可以优化其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。

对于Fe基双金属催化剂，如Fe3Ni1，在反应条件下氧化Fe的存在是通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化C-H键断裂的关键。这表明保持Fe处于氧化状态对于丙烯形成的选择性至关重要。

与Ni-O相比，Fe-O键更强，导致在CO2解离产生的氧存在下Fe会偏析到表面。这种氧化Fe的表面偏析可能在反应机理中起着关键作用，可能为C-H键活化提供活性位点。

这些见解表明，优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统应该关注：
1. 使用像CeO2这样的可还原支撑材料来促进氧交换和CO2活化。
2. 控制Fe的氧化状态，使其在反应过程中保持氧化形式。
3. 调整表面结构以优化CO2吸附和后续反应步骤。
4. 平衡双金属催化剂的组成，以利用每个组分的有益特性，如用于C-H活化的氧化Fe和用于其他反应步骤的金属Ni。
