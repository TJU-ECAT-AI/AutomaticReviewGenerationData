[1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[2] "Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 would fill the vacancy."

[3] "Apart from CO2 filling vacancies or providing lattice oxygen, the exchange over CeO2 can also provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression."

[4] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support material is particularly beneficial due to its readily reducible nature and ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states. This property enables efficient oxygen exchange, which is crucial for CO2 activation.

The structure of the ceria surface affects CO2 adsorption, which in turn influences the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process can weaken the C-O bond, while the vacancy geometry determines whether CO2 fills the vacancy. Additionally, the oxygen exchange over CeO2 can provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression, improving catalyst stability.

For Fe oxide-based catalysts, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This is evidenced by the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe under reaction conditions.

These insights suggest that the CO2-ODHP mechanism involves the interaction between the reducible support (CeO2) and the oxidized Fe species. The support facilitates CO2 activation and provides oxygen mobility, while the oxidized Fe promotes C-H bond cleavage. To optimize catalytic systems for this process, it is crucial to maintain the oxidized state of Fe while utilizing a reducible support like CeO2 that can efficiently activate CO2 and suppress coke formation.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。使用CeO2作为载体材料特别有利，因为它具有易还原性，能够在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间可逆转换。这一特性使得氧交换效率高，对CO2的活化至关重要。

氧化铈表面的结构影响CO2的吸附，进而影响CO2还原的机理和能量学。吸附过程可以削弱C-O键，而空位几何结构决定了CO2是否填充空位。此外，CeO2上的氧交换可以提供晶格氧以抑制积碳，提高催化剂稳定性。

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂，在反应条件下氧化Fe的存在是通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化性C-H键断裂的关键。Fe3Ni1催化剂在反应条件下由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，证实了这一点。

这些见解表明，CO2-ODHP机理涉及可还原载体（CeO2）和氧化Fe物种之间的相互作用。载体促进CO2的活化并提供氧的移动性，而氧化Fe促进C-H键的断裂。为了优化这一过程的催化系统，保持Fe的氧化状态并使用像CeO2这样的可还原载体至关重要，因为它可以有效地活化CO2并抑制积碳形成。
