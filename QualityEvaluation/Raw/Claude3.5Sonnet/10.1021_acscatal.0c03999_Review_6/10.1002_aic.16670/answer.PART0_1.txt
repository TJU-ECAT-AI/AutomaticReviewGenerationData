[1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[3] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[4] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

The reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts and the choice of support material significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support is particularly beneficial due to its ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, which facilitates oxygen exchange and CO2 activation. This redox property of CeO2 is critical for the overall reaction mechanism.

The structure of the catalyst surface, particularly the adsorption sites on CeO2, plays a crucial role in determining the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. This suggests that careful control of the catalyst structure can optimize its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

For Fe-based bimetallic catalysts, such as Fe3Ni1, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring the oxidative C-H bond cleavage pathway in CO2-ODHP. This indicates that maintaining Fe in an oxidized state is crucial for selectivity towards propylene formation.

The strong Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O leads to Fe segregation to the surface in the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation. This surface segregation of oxidized Fe likely plays a critical role in the reaction mechanism, potentially providing active sites for C-H bond activation.

These insights suggest that optimizing catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on:
1. Using reducible supports like CeO2 to facilitate oxygen exchange and CO2 activation.
2. Controlling the oxidation state of Fe to maintain it in an oxidized form during the reaction.
3. Tailoring the surface structure to optimize CO2 adsorption and subsequent reaction steps.
4. Balancing the composition of bimetallic catalysts to leverage the beneficial properties of each component, such as the oxidized Fe for C-H activation and metallic Ni for other reaction steps.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料的选择对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。使用CeO2作为支撑材料特别有益，因为它能够在Ce4+和Ce3+氧化态之间可逆转换，这促进了氧交换和CO2的活化。CeO2的这种氧化还原特性对整个反应机理至关重要。

催化剂表面的结构，特别是CeO2上的吸附位，在决定CO2还原的机理和能量学方面起着关键作用。这表明仔细控制催化剂结构可以优化其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。

对于Fe基双金属催化剂，如Fe3Ni1，在反应条件下氧化Fe的存在是通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化C-H键断裂的关键。这表明保持Fe处于氧化状态对于丙烯形成的选择性至关重要。

与Ni-O相比，Fe-O键更强，导致在CO2解离产生的氧存在下Fe会偏析到表面。这种氧化Fe的表面偏析可能在反应机理中起着关键作用，可能为C-H键活化提供活性位点。

这些见解表明，优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统应该关注：
1. 使用像CeO2这样的可还原支撑材料来促进氧交换和CO2活化。
2. 控制Fe的氧化状态，使其在反应过程中保持氧化形式。
3. 调整表面结构以优化CO2吸附和后续反应步骤。
4. 平衡双金属催化剂的组成，以利用每个组分的有益特性，如用于C-H活化的氧化Fe和用于其他反应步骤的金属Ni。
