[1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[2] "Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 would fill the vacancy."

[3] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The use of CeO2 as a support material is particularly beneficial due to its ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+, which facilitates oxygen exchange properties crucial for CO2 activation. This reducibility of the support material plays a key role in the adsorption and activation of CO2.

The structure of the support surface, particularly the vacancy geometry, is important in determining how CO2 interacts with the catalyst. The adsorption process can weaken the C-O bond, which is a critical step in CO2 activation and subsequent reactions.

For Fe oxide-based catalysts, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This suggests that maintaining Fe in an oxidized state during the reaction is crucial for the desired selectivity towards propylene production.

These insights into the reaction mechanism highlight the importance of catalyst design that maintains the appropriate oxidation states of both the active metal (Fe) and the support material (CeO2) under reaction conditions. Optimizing the reducibility of the support and the oxidation state of Fe could lead to improved catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP processes, potentially increasing selectivity towards propylene and overall catalyst performance.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和支撑材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。使用CeO2作为支撑材料特别有益，因为它能够在Ce4+和Ce3+之间可逆转换，这种特性有助于氧交换，对CO2活化至关重要。支撑材料的这种可还原性在CO2的吸附和活化中起着关键作用。

支撑表面的结构，特别是空位几何形状，对决定CO2如何与催化剂相互作用很重要。吸附过程可以削弱C-O键，这是CO2活化和后续反应的关键步骤。

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂，反应条件下Fe的氧化状态对于通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化性C-H键断裂至关重要。这表明在反应过程中保持Fe的氧化状态对于实现向丙烯生产的理想选择性是至关重要的。

这些对反应机理的见解突出了催化剂设计的重要性，即在反应条件下维持活性金属（Fe）和支撑材料（CeO2）的适当氧化状态。优化支撑材料的可还原性和Fe的氧化状态可能会导致CO2-ODHP过程的催化系统得到改进，潜在地提高对丙烯的选择性和整体催化剂性能。
