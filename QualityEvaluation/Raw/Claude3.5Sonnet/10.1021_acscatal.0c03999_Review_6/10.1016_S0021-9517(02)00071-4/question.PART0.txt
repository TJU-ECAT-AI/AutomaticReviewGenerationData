Abstract
The adsorption, decomposition, and reaction of propane with CO2 have been investigated on Rh catalysts, deposited on various supports.
The strong interaction of propane with Rh was noticed above 273 K. By means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, π-bonded
propylene, di-σ-bonded propylene, and propylidyne have been identified. Propane underwent dehydrogenation and cracking on supported
Rh at 824923 K. Propylene formed with a selectivity of 5060%. The other major products were ethylene and methane. The deposition
of carbonaceous species was also observed, the hydrogenation of which occurred only above 700750 K, with a peak temperature of 900
950 K. The amount of carbon was more than one order of magnitude higher than that of surface Rh atoms, suggesting its diffusion from the
Rh onto the support. The presence of CO2 basically altered the reaction pathway of propane, and the formation of H2 and CO with a ratio of
0.420.59 came into prominence. Propylene was detected only in traces. This led to the assumption that propylene reacted quickly with CO2
over Rh after its formation. This idea was confirmed by separate study of the reaction of propylene with CO2. Taking into account the rates
of decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalysts, as well as the reaction orders, we came to the conclusion that the CO2 is involved
in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming of propane. The highest specific rates for the production of H2 and CO were measured for
Rh/TiO2; this was explained by the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2.

1. Introduction
Supported Rh is one of the most active catalysts for the
dry reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas [1,2].
Its advantage is that it limits the carbon deposition that
causes the significant deterioration of other catalysts. This
was explained by the reaction of CO2 and CHx fragments
formed in the dissociation of methane [2]. Experiments
showed that this process is faster than the reaction between
CO2 and surface carbon formed at high temperature over
Rh [3]. Subsequent studies confirmed the high activity of Rh
and revealed several features of this catalytic reaction [49].
Later it was also observed that the presence of ethane in the
CH4 + CO2 gas mixture caused the enhancement of carbon
deposition and thereby the deactivation of the catalyst [10].
Detailed kinetic study on the C2H6 +CO2 reaction disclosed
that the deposition of surface carbon and the deactivation of
the catalyst can be prevented by larger amounts of CO2 [10].

In the present work the study of the catalytic performance
of the Rh catalyst has been extended to the dry reforming
of propane. Particular attention is paid to the C deposition
and to the effects of supports. A literature search for
the CO2 reforming of propane yielded only a few works.
Sutton et al. [11] examined the kinetics and the mechanism
of this process over Ru/Al2O3, whereas we performed a
comparative study on the catalytic efficiencies of alumina-
supported Pt metals [12]. The latter clearly indicated that
Ru and Rh are outstanding catalysts for this process. The
reaction of propane with CO2 was also investigated on
supported Mo2C catalysts, but the aim of the work was to
promote the production of propylene [13].
2. Experimental
The catalysts were prepared by impregnating the supports
with RhCl3 · 3H2O salt to yield a nominal 1 wt% metal. The
following supports were used: Al2O3 (Degussa P110Cl),
100 m2/g; SiO2 (Cab-O-Sil), 200 m2/g; MgO (DAB6),
170 m2/g; TiO2 (Degussa P25), 50 m2/g. The catalyst sam-
ples were oxidized at 523 K for 30 min and reduced at 773 K

for 60 min. The dispersion of Rh was determined by H2 ad-
sorption at 300 K. The gases used were initially of commer-
cial purity. CO2 was further purified by fractional distilla-
tion. Ar (99.95%) was deoxygenated with an oxytrap. The
other impurities were adsorbed on a 5-Å molecular sieve at
the temperature of liquid air. In the case of C3H8 decomposi-
tion the carrier gas was Ar which contained 12.5% propane.
In the study of C3H8 + CO2 reaction we used a stoichio-
metric (1 : 3) gas mixture. The propane content was again
12.5%. Kinetic measurements were carried out in a fixed
bed continuous-flow reactor made from a 0.7-mm i.d. quartz
tube. The amount of catalyst used was 0.3 g. The reaction
between C3H6 and CO2 has been studied in the same way.
For IR measurements self-supporting wafers (31 × 10 mm,
10 mg/cm2) were used. The flow rate of the reactant gases
was 60 ml/min. Inert gas was used as a diluent to deter-
mine the partial order of the reaction. The exit gases were
analyzed by gas chromatograph (HewlettPackard 5890) on
a Porapak QS column. Infrared spectra were recorded with
a Biorad Fourier transform IR spectrometer (Digilab. Div.
FTS 7) with a resolution of 4 cm1. Typically 128 scans
were collected. All subtractions of the spectra were taken
without the use of a scaling factor (f = 1.0000). The sup-
plementary method used was temperature-programmed re-
action (TPR). The heating rate was 6.0 K/min.
3. Results
3.1. Interaction of propane with Rh catalyst
The interaction between propane and Rh catalyst was first
investigated at 173300 K. For this study the more inert
SiO2 support was chosen. In order to obtain more intense
absorption bands 10 wt% Rh was used. The solid sample was
cooled in 1.33 mbar of propane to a selected temperature and
the IR spectrum was recorded after 10 min. FTIR spectra
obtained are shown in Fig. 1A. Note that the gas-phase
spectrum has been subtracted from each spectrum. At 173
193 K absorption bands appeared at 2960, 2940 (shoulder),
2904, 2876, 1649, 1466, and 1448 cm1 and several weak
bands between 1335 and 1387 cm1. Further increase in
the temperature led to the attenuation of all these bands. At
253 K a slight shift occurred in the positions of these bands
and new features clearly developed or intensified at 2930,
1452, 1353, and 1333 cm1. At 273 K, the only change
was the enhancement of the bands at 1353 cm1. After
evacuation at 300 K for 10 min absorption bands remained
at 2964, 2925, 2898, 2866, 2832, 1638, 1450, 1424, 1402,
1381, 1353, and 1333 cm1.
In the next experimental series the reduced sample was
exposed to 1.33 mbar of C3H8 at 300 K for 10 min, and
then the adsorbed layer was annealed under continuous
evacuation at different temperatures for 10 min. Spectra are
displayed in Fig. 1B. At 300 K we observed practically the
same bands as in the previous measurement. A dramatic

attenuation of the bands at 2965 and 2927 cm1 occurred
at 360 K, where the low-frequency bands also became very
weak. The next significant change was observed at 423
473 K, when only the spectral features at 2923, 2854,
1462, and 1455 cm1 remained; they were eliminated only
above 573 K. Absorption bands observed and their possible
assignments are shown in Table 1. Note that in the case of
pure silica no absorption band could be detected at and above
253 K at all. The above characteristics were observed for 1%
Rh/SiO2, too, but the bands were much weaker.
The same IR spectroscopic measurements have been
carried out in the presence of CO2. We found practically
identical spectral features with slight variations in the
positions and intensities of the absorption bands.

3.2. Decomposition of propane
The decomposition of propane was investigated in a
greater detail on Rh/Al2O3. A well measurable reaction
occurred at 823923 K. The initial fast decay was followed
by a slower deactivation process. The main product is
propylene; it formed with 5658% selectivity at 923 K,
which slightly increased with lowering the temperature. The
other major products were ethylene (s 20%), methane
(s 1012%), and benzene (s 58%). The decomposition
of propane and the formation of various products over
Rh/Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 2A.
In order to see whether the deposition of some car-
bonaceous species occurred during the reaction, the used
Rh/Al2O3 has been heated in H2 flow and the products
formed were analyzed from time to time. The formation
of methane was observed above 750 K, other hydrocarbons
were produced only in negligible amounts. Results are plot-
ted in Fig. 2B. The peak temperature is 960 K. From the
integration of the curve the amount of carbon deposited was
calculated (Table 2). It was more than one order of magni-
tude higher than that of surface Rh atoms.
The reaction of propane gave practically the same prod-
ucts over Rh/SiO2. In the case of Rh/MgO and Rh/TiO2
the formation of benzene was not detected. Data for the ef-

fects of the support on the decomposition of propane on Rh
is collected in Table 2. TPR measurements were also car-
ried out after the reaction. TPR spectra are also displayed
in Fig. 2B. The reactivity of carbon exhibited only a slight
variation with the support. The quantity of carbon formed
was the highest for Rh/Al2O3 and the lowest for Rh/TiO2.
3.3. Decomposition of CO2
In harmony with the previous FTIR spectroscopic mea-
surements the dissociation of CO2 proceeds on the most ac-
tive Rh/Al2O3 catalyst at and above 473 K as indicated by
the appearance of an absorption band at 2010 cm1 due to
adsorbed CO [2]. In the reacting gas mixture this absorp-
tion band appeared already at 373423 K. The decomposi-
tion of CO2 has also been studied in a flow system under
the same conditions as appeared in the C3H8 + CO2 reac-
tion. We found only very limited formation of gaseous CO
at 923 K; the conversion of CO2 was below 0.5%.
3.4. Reaction of propane with CO2
The addition of a small amount of CO2 (2.5% of C3H8)
to propane exerted a dramatic influence on its decomposi-
tion over Rh/Al2O3 at 923 K (Fig. 3). The rate of the forma-
tion of propylene markedly decreased, whereas that of hy-
drogen increased. CO and a small amount of methane were
also formed. With increased CO2 content the conversion of
propane and the production of H2 and CO gradually in-
creased, while that of propylene abruptly decreased to trace
amounts. A decrease was measured in the ratio of H2/CO
and a slight increase in the CH4/CO ratio. Using a stoichio-
metric composition of reacting gas mixture corresponding to
the equation
(1)
C3H8 + 3CO2 = 6CO + 4H2,
the initial conversion of propane was 8085%, which de-
cayed only to 63% after 2 h. The H2/CO ratio was
0.500.55. The CH4/CO ratio was around 0.110.13. These
results are plotted in Fig. 4. When the measurements over
Rh/Al2O3 were extended to 24 h, we found only very slight
changes in the data determined in 120150 min. Lower-
ing the reaction temperature caused a slight increase in the
H2/CO ratio and a decrease of the relative rate of CH4 pro-
duction occurred. Doubling the flow rate of the reacting gas
mixture led to an increase of the H2/CO ratio from 0.53 to
0.56 and to a decrease of the CH4/CO ratio from 0.13 to
0.09.
The amount of carbon remaining on the catalyst after the
reaction has been determined by TPR in the same way as
after the decomposition of propane. We obtained much less
carbon with a lower peak temperature, 825 K.
The kinetic orders were calculated from the logarithmic
plots of the various rates versus the volume percentage of the
reactants. In one experimental series the partial pressure of
CO2 was held constant at 285.0 Torr, while that of C3H8 was
varied. In the other case, the partial pressure of C3H8 was
kept constant at 95.0 Torr, and that of CO2 was changed. The
order of the reaction was zero in C3H8 and it was fractional
(0.40.45)with respect to CO2. From the Arrhenius plots the
activation energies were calculated. For the formation of H2
and CO, we obtained 87.4 and 92.2 kJ/mol, respectively.
3.5. Effects of support
Kinetic measurements were repeated for Rh deposited
on various supports. Some characteristic data are plotted in
Fig. 5. The rate of consumption of C3H8 and the H2/CO
ratios varied with the support but the general features
remained the same. Reaction rates were less than those
measured for Rh/Al2O3, which decreased in the order
Rh/TiO2, Rh/MgO, and Rh/SiO2. The H2/CO ratio was
the highest, 0.530.64, for Rh/TiO2. It was only 0.42 for
Rh/SiO2. The formation of methane was not detected. As
in the case of Rh/Al2O3, less carbon was deposited on the
catalysts than in the decomposition of propane. The peak
temperature of hydrogenation fell in the range 860940 K.
The most important data are collected in Table 3.
3.6. Reactions of propylene with CO2
As we can count with the transitory formation of propy-
lene during the dry reforming of propane, it was important to

know more about its reactions under the same experimental
conditions. In the absence of CO2, the cracking of propy-
lene proceeded at a very high rate at 923773 K, produc-
ing a large amount of carbon, which leads to a fast decay
in the rate of propylene decomposition. In the presence of
CO2 (C3H6/CO2 = 1/3), the product distribution dramati-
cally changed, and CO and H2 became the main products.
Starting the reaction at 773 K, the initial rates of the for-
mation of H2 and CO were higher than those determined for
C3H8 +CO2, but due to the carbon deposition the rates mea-
sured after 120 min were somewhat lower (Fig. 6). The activ-
ity order of the Rh samples followed that determined for the
C3H8 + CO2 reaction. The reactivity of carbon towards H2
was practically the same as that of the carbon produced by
the C3H8 + CO2 reaction. The peak temperatures fell in the
temperature range 900950 K. The amount of carbon mea-

sured decreased in the order Rh/Al2O3, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2.
Over Rh/TiO2 we found only a small amount of carbon,
which reacted with H2 above 800 K. When the C3H8/CO2
ratio was decreased from 1/3 to 1/6 the initial rate of for-
mation of H2 was doubled and decreased more slowly. The
amount of carbon formed in 120 min was also less.
4. Discussion
Although the complexity of the reaction and the occur-
rence of several secondary processes make it difficult to de-
termine the mechanism of the C3H8 + CO2 reaction, some
conclusions can be drawn on the basis of our supplementary
studies on the interaction of CO2 and CxHy with metal sur-
faces [817].
4.1. Interaction of propane with supported Rh
The interaction of propane with Rh/SiO2 has been stud-
ied by IR spectroscopy. Considering the characteristic vibra-
tions of propane and some related compounds (Table 1), we
can conclude that the absorption bands observed following
the adsorption of C3H8 onto Rh/SiO2 at 173193 K corre-
spond very well to the different vibrations of propane [14].
At 253273 K, a marked attenuation of these bands occurred
as a result of the desorption of propane. The spectral fea-
tures that remained or developed at 2930, 2830, 1429, 1411,
and 1374 cm1 suggest that a fraction of propane interacted
strongly with Rh (Fig. 1A). This is clearly indicated when
propane was brought into contact with the catalyst at 300
360 K. Taking into account the IR spectra of adsorbed propy-
lene and propylidyne [13,1517], some of these absorption
bands are attributed to di-σ-propylene formed in the dehy-
drogenation of propane, and some to the vibrations of propy-
lidyne, which is produced in the further dehydrogenation of
di-σ-propylene (Table 1). These surface species were also
detected following the adsorption of propane on Pt/SiO2
[15,16] and on Mo2C/SiO2 [13,17].

4.2. Decomposition and dehydrogenation of propane
In the decomposition of propane the dehydrogenation
reaction
(2)
C3H8 = C3H6 + H2
is the dominant process, in contrast to the reaction of
methane, which decomposes to carbon and hydrogen on the
same Rh catalysts [2]. Ethane was also produced in minor
amounts. This is very likely the result of the coupling of
CH3, the primary dissociation product of methane. If we
assume the same initial step in the interaction of propane
with metals, then we expect the transitory formation of
propyl species, C3H7,
(3)
C3H8(a) = C3H7(a) + H(a),
which dehydrogenates further to propylene,
(4)
C3H7(a) = C3H6(a) + H(a).
On the single-crystal surfaces of Pt metals under UHV con-
ditions, C3H7 species underwent dehydrogenation and hy-
drogenation, but its coupling into C6 compounds was not
observed [18,19]. It occurred, however, over Cu(110) [20],
Ag(111) [21], Au(111) [22], and to a limited extent, on
Mo2C/Mo(100) [23] surfaces. The last, with the combi-
nation of ZSM-5, is able to convert methane into aromat-
ics [2428]. Under the present experimental conditions, the
cracking of C3H7(a) and C3H6(a), resulting in the forma-
tion of a very unreactive carbon layer, also proceeded. Its
low reactivity suggests that the carbon is mainly in the form
of graphite. Taking into account the amount of carbon de-
posited and the dispersion of Rh we can come to the conclu-
sion that the larger part of the carbon locates on the support.
It is an interesting result that we detected the formation of C6
compounds on some supported Rh catalysts. Accordingly,
under the present experimental conditions the reductive cou-
pling of C3H7 into C6 compounds also took place.
From the calculation of the specific activities (turnover
number) of various catalysts in the dehydrogenation of
propane we obtained only slight deviations for different
samples (Table 2). An exception is Rh/TiO2, which exhibits
the highest activity. This value, however, can be considered
with caution due to the very low dispersion of the Rh. As
the support alone exerts no or very little activity we have
to assume that the activation and the reaction of propane
occur on the Rh or at the Rh/support interface. The large
amount of surface carbon measured, however, suggests that
the majority carbonaceous species formed in the cracking
of the reaction intermediates diffuses from the Rh onto the
support. The formation of surface carbon seems to be in
strong correlation with the conversion of propane (Table 2).
4.3. Reaction of propane with CO2
The presence of CO2 dramatically influenced the reac-
tion pathway of C3H8, and, instead of dehydrogenation and
cracking, the formation of H2 and CO came into promi-
nence. Although the presence of CO2 significantly reduced
the amount of carbon deposited, it could not prevent its for-
mation. This very unreactive carbon is probably responsible
384
F. Solymosi et al. / Journal of Catalysis 216 (2003) 377385
for the deactivation of the catalyst. Note that the formation
of carbon in the C3H8 + CO2 reaction has been observed on
all alumina-supported Pt metals [12]. However, it was not
reported by Sutton et al. [11] for Ru/Al2O3. As in the dry
reforming of methane we assume that the adsorbed species
of each reactant strongly influence the reactivity of the other.
Accordingly, (i) the dissociation of CO2,
(5)
CO2(g) = CO(a) + O(a),
is promoted by CxHy fragments of the decomposition of
C3H8, and (ii) the dissociation of C3H8 is facilitated by
adsorbed O formed in the decomposition of CO2. In the
latter case we may count with a new route for the formation
of C3H7 and C3H6
(6)
C3H8(a) + O(a) = C3H7(a) + OH(a),
(7)
C3H7(a) + O(a) = C3H6(a) + OH(a),
(8)
C3H7(a) = C3H6(g) + 1
2H2(g).
This is, however, not sufficient to explain changes in the
product distribution. The results suggest that in the presence
of adsorbed O atoms the reaction does not stop at the
formation of propylene. The latter compound may also
be activated by adsorbed O atoms to give further reactive
species,
(9)
C3H6(a) + O(a) = C3H5(a) + OH(a),
(10)
C3H5(a) = C3H4(a) + 1
2H2(g),
which react with adsorbed O on one hand and decompose to
hydrogen and carbon on the other hand,
(11)
C3H4(a) + O(a) = C3H3(a) + OH(a),
(12)
C3H4(a) = 3C(s) + 2H2(g).
Control measurements showed that the propylene + CO2
reaction proceeds at a high rate on supported Rh to give CO
and H2. That is probably the reason that when a sufficient
amount of CO2 is added to propane, propylene disappears
from the reaction products. Taking into account the rates of
decomposition of propane and CO2 on Rh catalyst, as well
as the reaction orders, we come to the conclusion that CO2
is involved in the rate-determining step of the dry reforming
of propane.
In our previous study of the dry reforming of methane
over Rh and Pd catalysts we found that the carbon species
formed or treated at high temperature is very unreactive to-
ward CO2 [2,29]. Therefore the lack of deposition of a sig-
nificant amount of carbon, which also leads to deactivation,
was explained by the direct reaction of CH3 or CH2 with
CO2,
(13)
CH3(a) + CO2(g) = 2CO(g) + 1.5H2(g),
which does not involve the formation of any kind of
carbon. Experiments with CH3 produced by the pyrolysis
of azomethane confirmed this assumption, as adsorbed CH3
reacted readily with gaseous CO2 [3]. We may assume
that the reaction of CxHy fragments with CO2 proceeds to
certain extent in the present case, too.
From the study of the effects of supports we obtained that
the reaction of propane took place at the highest rate over
Rh/Al2O3 catalyst (Table 3). On the basis of the turnover
numbers, the Rh/TiO2 shows the highest activity. This,
however, is partly due to the very low dispersion of that
sample due to the decoration effect occurred at the reduction
of the Rh/TiO2 at 773 K. Nevertheless, Rh/TiO2 is still the
most active catalyst, if we multiply the dispersion of Rh by
a factor of 10 (Table 3). Note that the Rh/TiO2 exhibited
the highest activity towards the dissociation of CO2 and CO,
which was explained by the electronic interaction between
Rh and the n-type TiO2 resulting in an extended electron
transfer from the Rh into the π orbital of CO2 and CO
[30,31].
5. Conclusions
(i) Propane interacted with supported Rh to give propylene
and propylidyene even at 253300 K.
(ii) The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurred
with selectivities of 4055% over supported Rh cata-
lysts. Carbon species deposited was very unreactive to-
ward H2: the peak temperature of its dehydrogenation
fell in the range of 900950 K.
(iii) In the presence of CO2 the reaction pathway of propane
is changed, and the formation of CO and H2 came into
prominence.
(iv) It was shown that propylene, the product of the de-
hydrogenation of propane, reacted rapidly with CO2
to give CO and H2. As regards the dry reforming of
propane, the highest specific rates were measured for
Rh/TiO2.
