The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were 
investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SIO2. Carbon 
dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting 
effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to 
suppress the catalyst deactivation. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The utilization of carbon dioxide has recently received much attention since the global 
warming mainly due to carbon dioxide was recognized as one of the most serious problems in 
the world. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol, hydrocarbons, etc., and 
the CO2 reforming of methane to syngas have been extensively studied. Furthermore, it has 
been reported that CO2 has several promoting effects on the conversion of hydrocarbons, for 
example, oxidative coupling of methane [1], aromatization of propane [2] and dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene [3, 4]. The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation 
of propane over several supported Cr203 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects 
on a silica-supported Cr203 catalysts.

catalyst, catalytic tests with alternate feeds of

CaH8/Ar and C3H8/CO2/Ar were carried out. The 
results shown in Figure 3 clearly indicate that the

presence of CO,,_ markedly improved the yield of 
C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that 
CO,, plays a promoting role in the conversion of 
0 
C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst. 
Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the 
reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the 
absence of CO 
2 decreased with increasing Cr203 
content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 
4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 
and SiO2 particles might have an important role in 
the promoting effect of CO2. 
The effect of CO2 addition on the deactivation 
of a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst was also examined (Figure 
-I 
5). The reaction conditions for the both cases with 
and without CO2 were the same except the catalyst 
weight, which was 50% larger in the case of the 
reaction without CO2, in order to obtain the same 
initial yield of C3H6. The decrease in the yield of 
C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO 
than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests 
 
that the addition of CO2 could suppress 
the 
deactivation of the catalyst. 
. 
3.2. TPR/D result 
Figure 6 shows TPR/D profiles during various 
treatments of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst. The Cr203 was 
found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller 
peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was 
reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re- 
reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could 
oxidize some part of the surface of Cr203 in the

A pulse reaction technique was employed tbr 
examining the initial activity of the catalyst. Figure

of C3H8 pulses on Cr203/SiO2 catalyst. The yield

of C3H6 reached a maximum of about 21% at the 
second pulse. After the second pulse, the yield of 15 
C3H6 slightly decreased with increasing pulse

number. The yield of C3H6 decreased to 17% by ,10 
the treatment of the catalyst with H2 after filth pulse, 
and remained constant from sixth pulse to ninth 
5 
pulse. The treatment of the catalyst with CO2 after 
ninth pulse raised the yield of C3H6 to 19%, but the 
yield of C3H6 gradually decreased with increasing 
0 
pulses number from 10th pulses. These findings 
confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst 
could be more active for the dehydrogenation of 
C3H8 than a reduced catalyst. The results obtained 
from pulse reaction studies and from TPR/D studies 
might explain slower deactivation of the catalyst 
during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. 
Furthemore, pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the yield of 
C3H6 during the reaction in stream of CO2 and in a stream of He. The C3H 
6 yield at the first 
pulse and the second pulse in the presence of CO2 was found to be higher than those in the 
absence of CO2. This strongly suggests that CO2 could enhance the rate of the 
dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst. This promoting effects of CO2 might 
occur at the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles, as described in 3.1. 
4. CONCLUSION 
The effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 exhibits only on 
SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of CO, over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were 
to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized 
Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of 
CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction.
