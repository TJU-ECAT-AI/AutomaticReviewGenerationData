[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SIO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."

[2] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr203 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on a silica-supported Cr203 catalysts."

[3] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[4] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into the effects of support materials and reducibility on Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which may have some relevance to the question.

The study shows that the support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibited promoting effects with CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

Regarding reducibility, the research indicates that maintaining a partially oxidized state of the metal oxide is beneficial for the reaction. In the presence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface was kept partially oxidized, which correlated with enhanced catalytic performance and reduced deactivation.

The study also suggests that the interface between the metal oxide and support particles is important for the promoting effect of CO2. This implies that optimizing the dispersion and interaction of the active phase with the support could be a strategy for improving catalyst performance.

While these findings are specific to Cr2O3 catalysts, they provide some general principles that could be applicable to the development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The choice of support material, the ability to maintain a partially oxidized state, and the optimization of the metal oxide-support interface are likely to be important factors in designing effective catalysts for this process.

该文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于支撑材料和可还原性对Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢反应的影响的见解，这可能与该问题有一定的相关性。

研究表明，支撑材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。SiO2支撑的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出促进作用，而Al2O3和活性碳支撑的催化剂则没有。这表明活性金属氧化物与支撑材料之间的相互作用在决定催化行为中起着关键作用。

关于可还原性，研究表明保持金属氧化物的部分氧化状态对反应有利。在CO2存在下，Cr2O3表面保持部分氧化状态，这与增强的催化性能和降低的失活相关。

研究还表明，金属氧化物与支撑材料颗粒之间的界面对CO2的促进作用很重要。这意味着优化活性相的分散和与支撑材料的相互作用可能是提高催化剂性能的一种策略。

虽然这些发现是特定于Cr2O3催化剂的，但它们提供了一些可能适用于开发Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应的一般原则。支撑材料的选择、保持部分氧化状态的能力以及优化金属氧化物-支撑材料界面可能是设计这一过程有效催化剂的重要因素。
