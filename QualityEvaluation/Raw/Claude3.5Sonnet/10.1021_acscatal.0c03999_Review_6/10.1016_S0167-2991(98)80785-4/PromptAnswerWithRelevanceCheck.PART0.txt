[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol, hydrocarbons, etc., and the CO2 reforming of methane to syngas have been extensively studied."

[2] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[3] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[5] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not specifically discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into the behavior of Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, which may be relevant to understanding catalyst performance in similar reactions.

The study found that the support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed promoting effects in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity and CO2 utilization.

The reducibility of the catalyst was found to be important. In the presence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface was maintained in a partially oxidized state, which was more active for propane dehydrogenation than the fully reduced state. This indicates that the ability of CO2 to maintain the catalyst in an optimal oxidation state is a key factor in its promoting effect.

The study also suggests that the interface between the metal oxide and support particles is important for the CO2 promoting effect, as the ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence vs. absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content.

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 rather than Fe oxide, it provides insights into how support materials and oxidation states can influence catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions with CO2. These principles may be applicable to the development and optimization of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, suggesting that careful selection of support materials and control of the catalyst's oxidation state could be crucial for maximizing performance.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于在CO2存在下，不同材料支撑的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的行为见解，这可能与理解类似反应中催化剂性能有关。

研究发现，支撑材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。在CO2存在下，SiO2支撑的Cr2O3催化剂表现出促进效应，而Al2O3和活性炭支撑的催化剂则没有。这表明活性金属氧化物与支撑材料之间的相互作用在决定催化活性和CO2利用方面起着关键作用。

催化剂的可还原性被发现是重要的。在CO2存在下，Cr2O3表面保持在部分氧化状态，这种状态对丙烷脱氢反应比完全还原状态更活跃。这表明CO2能够将催化剂维持在最佳氧化状态是其促进作用的关键因素。

研究还表明，金属氧化物和支撑材料颗粒之间的界面对CO2的促进效应很重要，因为随着Cr2O3含量的增加，CO2存在下与不存在时的C3H6产率比率降低。

虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3而不是Fe氧化物上，但它提供了关于支撑材料和氧化状态如何影响催化剂在含CO2的脱氢反应中的性能的见解。这些原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应中Fe氧化物基催化剂的开发和优化，表明仔细选择支撑材料和控制催化剂的氧化状态对于最大化性能可能至关重要。

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into the effects of support materials and reducibility on Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which may have some relevance to the question.

The study shows that the support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibited promoting effects with CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

Regarding reducibility, the research indicates that maintaining a partially oxidized state of the metal oxide is beneficial for the reaction. In the presence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface was kept partially oxidized, which correlated with enhanced catalytic performance and reduced deactivation.

The study also suggests that the interface between the metal oxide and support particles is important for the promoting effect of CO2. This implies that optimizing the dispersion and interaction of the active phase with the support could be a strategy for improving catalyst performance.

While these findings are specific to Cr2O3 catalysts, they provide some general principles that could be applicable to the development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. The choice of support material, the ability to maintain a partially oxidized state, and the optimization of the metal oxide-support interface are likely to be important factors in designing effective catalysts for this process.

该文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于支撑材料和可还原性对Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢反应的影响的见解，这可能与该问题有一定的相关性。

研究表明，支撑材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。SiO2支撑的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出促进作用，而Al2O3和活性碳支撑的催化剂则没有。这表明活性金属氧化物与支撑材料之间的相互作用在决定催化行为中起着关键作用。

关于可还原性，研究表明保持金属氧化物的部分氧化状态对反应有利。在CO2存在下，Cr2O3表面保持部分氧化状态，这与增强的催化性能和降低的失活相关。

研究还表明，金属氧化物与支撑材料颗粒之间的界面对CO2的促进作用很重要。这意味着优化活性相的分散和与支撑材料的相互作用可能是提高催化剂性能的一种策略。

虽然这些发现是特定于Cr2O3催化剂的，但它们提供了一些可能适用于开发Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应的一般原则。支撑材料的选择、保持部分氧化状态的能力以及优化金属氧化物-支撑材料界面可能是设计这一过程有效催化剂的重要因素。

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights on Cr2O3 catalysts that may be relevant:

The support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 showed promoting effects with CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not. This suggests the importance of catalyst-support interactions.

Reducibility plays a key role. In the absence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface is reduced during reaction. With CO2 present, it remains partially oxidized, which is linked to higher activity. This indicates that maintaining an optimal oxidation state is crucial for catalyst performance.

The proposed mechanism involves CO2 helping to maintain the catalyst in a partially oxidized state, which enhances activity and stability. This suggests that for Fe oxide catalysts, designing systems that can maintain an optimal oxidation state in reaction conditions could improve performance.

To optimize catalytic systems, the insights suggest focusing on:
1. Selecting appropriate support materials that enhance activity
2. Tuning reducibility to maintain an optimal oxidation state
3. Utilizing CO2 or other oxidants to stabilize the active catalyst state

While these findings are for Cr2O3 catalysts, they provide a framework for investigating and optimizing Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

这篇文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于Cr2O3催化剂的见解，这些见解可能具有相关性：

载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。SiO2负载的Cr2O3在CO2存在下表现出促进效果，而Al2O3和活性炭载体则没有。这表明催化剂-载体相互作用的重要性。

可还原性起着关键作用。在没有CO2的情况下，Cr2O3表面在反应过程中被还原。而在CO2存在的情况下，它保持部分氧化状态，这与更高的活性有关。这表明维持最佳氧化状态对催化剂性能至关重要。

提出的机理涉及CO2帮助维持催化剂处于部分氧化状态，从而提高活性和稳定性。这表明对于Fe氧化物催化剂，设计能在反应条件下维持最佳氧化状态的系统可能会提高性能。

为优化催化系统，这些见解建议关注：
1. 选择适当的载体材料以提高活性
2. 调节可还原性以维持最佳氧化状态
3. 利用CO2或其他氧化剂来稳定活性催化剂状态

虽然这些发现是针对Cr2O3催化剂的，但它们为研究和优化Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用提供了一个框架。
