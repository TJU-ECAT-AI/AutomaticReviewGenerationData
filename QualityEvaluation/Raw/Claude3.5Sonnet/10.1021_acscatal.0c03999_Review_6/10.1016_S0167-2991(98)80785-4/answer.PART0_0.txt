[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol, hydrocarbons, etc., and the CO2 reforming of methane to syngas have been extensively studied."

[2] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on a silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[3] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[5] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not specifically discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into the behavior of Cr2O3 catalysts supported on different materials for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, which may be relevant to understanding catalyst performance in similar reactions.

The study found that the support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed promoting effects in the presence of CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity and CO2 utilization.

The reducibility of the catalyst was found to be important. In the presence of CO2, the Cr2O3 surface was maintained in a partially oxidized state, which was more active for propane dehydrogenation than the fully reduced state. This indicates that the ability of CO2 to maintain the catalyst in an optimal oxidation state is a key factor in its promoting effect.

The study also suggests that the interface between the metal oxide and support particles is important for the CO2 promoting effect, as the ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence vs. absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content.

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 rather than Fe oxide, it provides insights into how support materials and oxidation states can influence catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions with CO2. These principles may be applicable to the development and optimization of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, suggesting that careful selection of support materials and control of the catalyst's oxidation state could be crucial for maximizing performance.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于在CO2存在下，不同材料支撑的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的行为见解，这可能与理解类似反应中催化剂性能有关。

研究发现，支撑材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。在CO2存在下，SiO2支撑的Cr2O3催化剂表现出促进效应，而Al2O3和活性炭支撑的催化剂则没有。这表明活性金属氧化物与支撑材料之间的相互作用在决定催化活性和CO2利用方面起着关键作用。

催化剂的可还原性被发现是重要的。在CO2存在下，Cr2O3表面保持在部分氧化状态，这种状态对丙烷脱氢反应比完全还原状态更活跃。这表明CO2能够将催化剂维持在最佳氧化状态是其促进作用的关键因素。

研究还表明，金属氧化物和支撑材料颗粒之间的界面对CO2的促进效应很重要，因为随着Cr2O3含量的增加，CO2存在下与不存在时的C3H6产率比率降低。

虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3而不是Fe氧化物上，但它提供了关于支撑材料和氧化状态如何影响催化剂在含CO2的脱氢反应中的性能的见解。这些原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应中Fe氧化物基催化剂的开发和优化，表明仔细选择支撑材料和控制催化剂的氧化状态对于最大化性能可能至关重要。
