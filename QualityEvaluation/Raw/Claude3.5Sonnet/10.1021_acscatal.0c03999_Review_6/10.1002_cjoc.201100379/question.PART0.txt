Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over zinc oxide catalysts supported on steaming-treated HZSM-5 in 
the presence of CO2 has been investigated. The highest catalytic performance can be achieved on the 
5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst with the HZSM-5 support steaming at 650 , which allows the maximum propyl-
ene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of pro-
pane at 600 . The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and 
appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support. The catalytic stability is enhanced by the addition of 
CO2 to the feed gas due to the suppression of coke formation.

Introduction 
Propylene is an important raw material for producing 
polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic 
acid and so on. At present, a majority of propylene is 
obtained as a by-product of ethylene production by the 
naphtha steam-cracking process and of a fluid catalytic 
cracking (FCC) of petroleum. To meet the rapidly in-
creasing demands of the propylene market, the catalytic 
dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing signifi-
cance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking 
and FCC. However, this process has some inherent 
drawbacks, such as thermodynamic limitations for pro-
pane conversion, high energy requirements due to en-
dothermic reaction and limited catalytic stability owing 
to coke formation.[1,2] Alternatively, the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of propane by oxygen is free from thermo-
dynamic constraints and can be operated at lower tem-
peratures with an exothermic reaction.[3] Nevertheless, 
the use of O2 as the oxidant resulted in unavoidable 
over-oxidation, leading to inefficient use of the reactant 
and low selectivity to propylene.  
Over the last decade, the utilization of carbon diox-
ide as a mild oxidant for the selective dehydrogenation 
of light alkanes to alkenes and ethylbenzene to styrene 
is of particularly interest.[4-7] As to propane dehydroge-
nation, this new process has been reported to give rather 
high propylene selectivity due to the lack of deep oxida-
tion of propane.[8] Moreover, carbon dioxide can pro-
mote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mecha-
nism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehy-
drogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift 
reaction.[9,10] ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has 
been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing 
to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific 
surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, 
the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or 
support. Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel 
structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking. It is 
well known that ZnO- or Ga2O3-loaded HZSM-5 mate-
rials are good catalysts for the production of aromatics 
from light alkanes including propane.[11,12] Recently, we 
have demonstrated that Ga2O3 catalysts supported on 
steam-treated 
HZSM-5 
or 
phosphorous-modified 
HZSM-5 are highly active and stable for dehydrogena-
tion of propane to propylene in the presence of 
CO2.[13-15] Our findings suggest that reducing the num-
ber or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 
can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus lead-
ing to the enhanced propylene yield. The aim of the 
present study is to extend our recent work on the appli-
cations of HZSM-5-supported oxide catalysts in pro-
pane dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of 
CO2,[13-16] herein, we report the use of ZnO supported 
on steam-treated HZSM-5 as a new efficient catalyst in 
the dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene. 
The catalytic performance was correlated with the

physicochemical properties of the catalysts. 
Experimental 
Catalyst preparation 
Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite 
(Si/Al25) was carried out at various temperatures 
(600, 650 and 700 ) for 6 h, followed by washing 
with 1 mol•L
1 HNO3 at 95  for 24 h, filtering, dry-
ing and calcining at 600  for 6 h. Supported zinc 
oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnating an 
aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2 on HZSM-5 or steam-
ing-treated HZSM-5 using the incipient wetness method. 
The impregnated samples were dried at 100  and 
calcined at 600  for 6 h in air flow. The catalysts 
were designated as mZnO/HZSM-5(n), where m repre-
sents the weight percentage of ZnO in the catalysts and 
n is the steaming temperature.  
Catalyst characterization 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were re-
corded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using 
nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA 
with a scanning range (2θ) of 540. The surface area 
and pore volume were analyzed by N2 adsorption at liq-
uid N2 temperature using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 
instrument. The surface acidity was measured by tem-
perature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) in 
a flow-type fixed-bed reactor at ambient pressure. A 
100 mg sample was preheated at 550  for 2 h, and 
then cooled to 120  in flowing helium. At this tem-
perature, sufficient pulses of ammonia were injected 
until adsorption saturation occurred, followed by purg-
ing with helium for 2 h. The temperature was then 
raised from 120 to 600  at a rate of 10 •min
1. 
The ammonia desorbed was collected in a liquid N2 trap 
and detected by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) 
equipped with a TCD. The Brnsted acidity was meas-
ured by a model acid-catalyzed reaction (i.e. cumene 
cracking) in a pulsed microreactor. The reaction tem-
perature was 300 , and the sample load was 20 mg. 
Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 
40 mL•min
1. The amount of cumene injected for each 
test was 1 μL. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was 
conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 apparatus to de-
termine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst 
after reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
measurements were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 
5000C spectrometer with Mg Kα radiation as the ex-
citation source.  
Activity measurement 
Catalytic tests for propane dehydrogenation in the 
presence of CO2 were performed at 600  in a fixed- 
bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The 
catalyst load was 0.2 g, and it was activated at 600  
for 1 h in nitrogen flow prior to the reaction. The gas 
reactant contained 2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% carbon 
dioxide and balancing nitrogen. The total flow rate of 
the gas reactant was 20 mL•min
1. The hydrocarbon 
reaction products were analyzed using an on-line GC 
equipped with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a 
FID. The aromatic products in the gas were analyzed 
on-line by another GC equipped with a 2-m packed col-
umn of DNP and a FID.  
Results and Discussion 
Structure and physicochemical properties 
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the supported 
zinc oxide catalysts. It is evident that all the samples 
have a typical MFI structure with characteristic diffrac-
tion peaks at 2θ8.0, 8.9, 23.1, 23.3 and 24.0. The 
peak intensities of the samples are similar, indicating 
that the MFI-type framework structure of HZSM-5 
keeps intact after the steaming treatment. No character-
istic peaks of zinc oxide were observed on the XRD 
patterns, suggesting that zinc oxide is highly dispersed 
on the supports.

HZSM-5(650), (d) 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(700). 
The textural properties of the supported zinc oxide 
catalysts are listed in Table 1. The specific surface areas 
of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide 
catalysts are slightly lower than that of the parent 
HZSM-5 supported one. The micropore areas and pore 
volumes of the catalysts are in the range of 291332 
m2•g
1 and 0.150.16 cm3•g
1, respectively. Such high 
values demonstrate that the micropore channels of 
HZSM-5 supports were not blocked by the supported 
ZnO species. 
The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was meas-
ured using cumene cracking as a model reaction, and the 
results are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that the activ-
ity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is 
indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms 
in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since 
cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid 
sites.[17] Moreover, the activity of the steaming-treated 
HZSM-5 supports decreases with increase in the

steaming temperature, showing that the higher the 
steaming temperature, the lower the number of Brnsted 
acid sites. The acidity of various HZSM-5 supports was 
also measured by the NH3-TPD method, and the results 
are summarized in Table 2. As presented in Table 2, the 
number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of 
NH3 desorbed at 120350 ), strong acid sites (ex-
pressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600 ) 
and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are 
evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The 
severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity. 
The NH3-TPD results are in agreement with the model 
acid-catalyzed reaction data of cumene cracking. 
Catalytic performance 
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the 
presence of CO2 was carried out at 600  over the 
parent and steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported zinc 
oxide catalysts. The results are given in Table 3 and 
Figure 2. Although the initial propane conversion over 
the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst is really high (99.9%), it 
decreases very fast with time on stream, being 7.1% 
after 30 h on-stream operation. In contrast, the conver-
sion of propane on steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported 
ZnO catalysts drops much slowly, although the initial 
propane conversion over these catalysts is markedly 
lower, indicating that steaming treatment on the 
HZSM-5 support has a distinct influence on the catalytic 
performance of the supported ZnO samples. The en-
hanced catalyst stability can also be verified by meas-
uring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream 
for 30 h. As shown in Table 3, the amount of coke re-
duces significantly after the steaming treatment on 
HZSM-5. For all catalysts, the propane conversion de-
clines with reaction time, and almost reaches steady 
state after 30 h on stream. The steady state conversion 
of propane decreases in the order of 5%ZnO/HZSM- 
5(650)5%ZnO/HZSM-5(600)5%ZnO/HZSM-  
5(700)5%ZnO/HZSM-5. Figure 2B shows the yield 
of propylene over supported zinc oxide catalysts as a 
function of reaction time. The propylene yield of the 
5%ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst first increases with reaction 
time up to 23.1% at 9 h on stream, and then falls rapidly 
to 2.4% at 30 h on stream. The initial rise in propylene 
yield is due to the sharp increase in the propylene selec-
tivity in the initial stage of the reaction. In contrast, the 
steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts 
show a quite different performance evolution, and their 
propylene yields diminish gradually with reaction time, 
almost reaching steady state after 30 h on stream. The 
5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst affords the highest yield 
of propylene with an initial value of 29.7%. Even after 
30 h on-stream operation, a high propylene yield up to 
20.3% could still be maintained for this catalyst. The 
steady state yield of propylene over supported ZnO cat-
alysts follows the same order as propane conversion at 
the steady state. The above results suggest that too many 
and too few Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are both 
not favored to the dehydrogenation reaction, and appro-
priate density of Brnsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 is 
crucial to the catalytic performance of ZnO/HZSM-5. 
It is widely recognized that the transformation of 
propane over zinc-promoted HZSM-5 catalyst proceeds 
through a bifunctional mechanism. Zinc oxide species 
are responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of 
propane, as shown in Scheme 1,[18] while Brnsted acid 
sites (i.e. zeolitic protons) account for catalyzing the 
oligomerization of propylene and the cyclization of 
C6C9 alkenes.[19,20] Therefore, the decrease in the 
number of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst would 
suppress the side reactions such as oligomerization, cy-
clization, cracking and aromatization, thus leading to 
the high propylene yield and superior stability due to the 
decrease in coke formation on the catalyst surface. This 
is the reason why the steaming-treated HZSM-5 sup-
ported ZnO catalysts exhibit superior catalytic per-
formance in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of

CO2 than the parent HZSM-5 supported one. As the 
steaming temperature of HZSM-5 is increased from 600 
to 700 , the Zn/Si ratio of supported ZnO catalysts 
measured by XPS increases as well (Table 1), indicative 
of better ZnO dispersion on the HZSM-5 support. This 
would lead to the enhanced activity in propane dehy-
drogenation. Using DFT calculations, Pidko and van 
Santen[18] have proposed that the presence of acidic 
protons in the catalyst can promote the regeneration of 
the active sites on zinc-promoted ZSM-5, leading to an 
increase in activity for light alkane dehydrogenation. 
Therefore, on the other hand, the decrease in Brnsted 
acidity of HZSM-5 with steaming temperature (Table 2) 
would diminish the activity in propane dehydrogenation. 
A balance between these two contrary aspects (increase 
in ZnO dispersion on HZSM-5 and decrease in Brnsted 
acidity of HZSM-5 with an increase in the steaming 
temperature) results in the observation that the 
5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst shows the highest dehy-
drogenation activity and propylene yield among the 
steaming-treated HZSM-5 supported ZnO samples.

The influence of ZnO content of ZnO/HZSM-5(650) 
catalysts on propane dehydrogenation in the presence of 
CO2 was also investigated, and the results are presented 
in Figure 3. It is observed that the propylene yield on 
ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalysts is strongly dependent on 
the ZnO content. The propylene yield first increases 
with ZnO content up to 3%, then levels off with further 
increase in ZnO content from 3% to 10%. 
Carbon monoxide was detected in the effluent gases. 
The variation of the amount of CO in the reaction prod-
uct with reaction time on 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) cata-
lyst was measured, and the results are shown in Figure 4. 
The amount of CO formed in the reaction is always 
higher than that of consumed CO2, but lower than twice 
of CO2 consumed in the reaction, suggesting that CO2 
was converted into CO through both the reverse wa-
ter-gas shift reaction (CO2H2  COH2O) and the 
Boudouard reaction (CO2C  2CO) during the de-
hydrogenation process. Figure 5 compares the propyl-
ene yield on the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst as a 
function of time on stream in the presence and absence 
of carbon dioxide. The initial propylene yield in the 
presence of CO2 (29.7%) is slightly lower than that in 
the absence of CO2 (30.8%). However, the propylene 
yield after 30 h on stream is obviously higher in the 
former case (20.3%) than in the latter one (16.0%), in-
dicating that the catalyst stability is improved by the  
Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene over Steaming-treated HZSM-5 Supported ZnO

addition of CO2. The amount of coke after 30 h reaction 
in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the 
absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%). The suppression of coke 
formation in the presence of CO2 may result from the 
elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction. There-
fore, in conjunction with the coke formation data of the 
spent catalyst, the enhanced stability of the catalyst in 
the presence of CO2 is due to its low coking tendency as 
a function of time on stream.  
Attempt was also made to regenerate the best per-
formance catalyst of 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) after 10 h 
of reaction at 600  in the presence of CO2. As shown 
in Figure 6, the propylene yield on the catalyst de-
creases from 29.7% to 25.3% after 10 h on stream. The 
reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and then 
flowing air was introduced at 600  for 2 h followed 
by purge with N2 for another 1 h. It is obvious that the 
original propylene yield of 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) could 
be fully restored, with no noticeable deactivation being 
detected even after the second regeneration. The full 
recovery of the activity after the air treatment is due to 
the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst. 
This result also implies that the coke formation is re-
sponsible for the catalyst deactivation.

Conclusions 
In summary, dehydrogenation of propane to propyl-
ene in the presence of CO2 over steaming-treated 
HZSM-5 supported ZnO catalysts has been investigated. 
The optimal steaming temperature of the parent 
HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650 , 
and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum 
propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and 
steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogena-
tion of propane to prepare propylene at 600 . The 
superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is a con-
sequence of high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate 
Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 sup-
port. The improved stability of the catalyst in the pres-
ence of CO2 in comparison with in the absence of CO2 
is due to the suppression of coke formation resulting 
from elimination of the coke by the Boudouard reaction.
