<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions or their reducibility and support materials. The document primarily discusses dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation of paraffins using other types of catalysts, but does not mention the specific topic of Fe oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
