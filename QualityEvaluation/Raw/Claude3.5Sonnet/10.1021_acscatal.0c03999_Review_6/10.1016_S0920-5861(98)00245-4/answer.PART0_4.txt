[1] "The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed the diffraction lines ascribed only to the phases of respective supports. In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study does not directly investigate Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into how support materials and reducibility influence the performance of Cr2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation with CO2, which may be applicable to similar catalytic systems.

The support material significantly affects catalyst performance. Cr2O3/SiO2 showed enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, while Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed decreased activity, and Cr2O3/AC was unaffected. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

Reducibility is also important. The study shows that Cr2O3 can be reduced by H2 and re-oxidized by CO2. The partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 on SiO2 was found to be more active for propane dehydrogenation. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction, which may explain the enhanced activity and stability of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

These findings suggest a reaction mechanism where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, maintaining the active state of the catalyst. This could be applicable to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. To optimize catalytic systems for this process, one should consider:

1. Selecting appropriate support materials that enhance the catalyst's interaction with CO2.
2. Balancing the reducibility of the active metal oxide to maintain a partially oxidized state.
3. Utilizing CO2 as both a reactant and a catalyst regeneration agent.

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 catalysts, the principles of support material selection and redox behavior could guide the development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

该研究并未直接调查Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现。然而，它提供了关于载体材料和可还原性如何影响Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢性能的见解，这可能适用于类似的催化系统。

载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。Cr2O3/SiO2在CO2存在下表现出增强的活性，而Cr2O3/Al2O3活性降低，Cr2O3/AC则不受影响。这表明活性金属氧化物与载体之间的相互作用在决定催化行为中起着关键作用。

可还原性也很重要。研究表明，Cr2O3可被H2还原并被CO2重新氧化。SiO2上部分氧化的Cr2O3状态被发现对丙烷脱氢更活跃。CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态，这可能解释了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂增强的活性和稳定性。

这些发现暗示了一种反应机制，其中CO2作为温和的氧化剂，维持催化剂的活性状态。这可能适用于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。为优化这一过程的催化系统，应考虑：

1. 选择合适的载体材料，增强催化剂与CO2的相互作用。
2. 平衡活性金属氧化物的可还原性，以维持部分氧化状态。
3. 利用CO2作为反应物和催化剂再生剂。

虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3催化剂上，但载体材料选择和氧化还原行为的原理可以指导Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的开发。
