[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[2] "The post-reactor XRD was performed. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed, but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in Cr2O3/SiO2."

[3] "TPR/D studies were carried out to elucidate the behavior of Cr2O3 in the catalyst during treatment with H2 and CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[5] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study focuses on Cr2O3-based catalysts rather than Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the results:

1. The support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed promoting effects with CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not.

2. The reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role. CO2 can partially oxidize the surface of Cr2O3 on SiO2 support, maintaining it in a partially oxidized state during the reaction. This partially oxidized state is more active for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The proposed mechanism involves CO2 acting as a mild oxidant, preventing complete reduction of the catalyst surface and maintaining its activity.

4. To optimize catalytic systems, the choice of support material is critical. The interaction between the active metal oxide and the support influences the catalyst's redox properties and its ability to utilize CO2 effectively.

5. The boundaries between the metal oxide and support particles may be important for the promoting effect of CO2, suggesting that optimizing the dispersion of the active phase on the support could enhance catalyst performance.

These findings, although specific to Cr2O3 catalysts, provide insights into how support materials and reducibility can influence catalyst performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, which may be applicable to the development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for similar processes.

虽然这项研究主要集中在Cr2O3基催化剂而非Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应，但我们仍可从结果中得到一些见解：

1. 载体材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出促进效应，而Al2O3和活性炭载体则没有。

2. 催化剂的可还原性起着关键作用。CO2可以部分氧化SiO2载体上Cr2O3的表面，在反应过程中保持其部分氧化状态。这种部分氧化状态对丙烷脱氢更为活跃。

3. 提出的机理涉及CO2作为温和的氧化剂，防止催化剂表面完全还原，从而维持其活性。

4. 要优化催化系统，载体材料的选择至关重要。活性金属氧化物与载体之间的相互作用影响催化剂的氧化还原性质及其有效利用CO2的能力。

5. 金属氧化物与载体颗粒之间的界面可能对CO2的促进效应很重要，这表明优化活性相在载体上的分散可能会提高催化剂性能。

这些发现虽然特定于Cr2O3催化剂，但为载体材料和可还原性如何影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂性能提供了见解，这可能适用于开发类似过程的Fe氧化物基催化剂。
