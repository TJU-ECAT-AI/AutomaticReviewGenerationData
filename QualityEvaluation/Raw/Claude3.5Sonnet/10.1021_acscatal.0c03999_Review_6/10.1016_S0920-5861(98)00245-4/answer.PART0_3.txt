[1] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[2] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into the influence of reducibility and support materials on Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which may have some relevance.

The study shows that the reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its performance. The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was found to be more active when partially oxidized rather than fully reduced. CO2 was able to oxidize some part of the Cr2O3 surface, maintaining it in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which enhanced catalytic activity and stability.

The support material was also found to be critical. The promoting effects of CO2 were only observed on SiO2-supported catalysts, not on Al2O3 or active carbon supports. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support is crucial for enabling CO2 promotion.

These findings suggest a mechanism where the partially oxidized state of the metal oxide and its interaction with the support material are key factors in the catalyst's performance. The ability of CO2 to maintain this partially oxidized state appears to be central to its promoting effect.

For optimizing catalytic systems, these results suggest that choosing an appropriate support material and tailoring the oxidation state of the active metal oxide are crucial strategies. While this study focused on Cr2O3 catalysts, similar principles might apply to Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, although further research would be needed to confirm this.

该文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于还原性和载体材料对Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢反应性能影响的见解，这可能具有一定的相关性。

研究表明，催化剂的还原性在其性能中起着至关重要的作用。部分氧化状态的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比完全还原状态的催化剂更活跃。CO2能够氧化Cr2O3表面的一部分，在反应过程中保持其部分氧化状态，从而提高了催化活性和稳定性。

载体材料也被发现是至关重要的。CO2的促进作用只在SiO2负载的催化剂上观察到，而在Al2O3或活性炭载体上没有观察到。这表明活性金属氧化物与载体之间的相互作用对于实现CO2促进作用至关重要。

这些发现暗示了一种机制，即金属氧化物的部分氧化状态及其与载体材料的相互作用是催化剂性能的关键因素。CO2维持这种部分氧化状态的能力似乎是其促进作用的核心。

对于优化催化系统，这些结果表明，选择适当的载体材料和调整活性金属氧化物的氧化状态是关键策略。虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3催化剂上，但类似的原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应的Fe氧化物基催化剂，尽管还需要进一步的研究来确认这一点。
