Abstract
The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3
catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported
Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to
suppress the catalyst deactivation. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction
The utilization of carbon dioxide has recently
received much attention since the global warming
mainly due to carbon dioxide was recognized as
one of the most serious problems in the world. The
catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol,
hydrocarbons, etc., and the CO2 reforming of methane
to syngas have been extensively studied. Furthermore,
it has been reported that CO2 has several promoting
effects on the conversion of hydrocarbons, for exam-
ple, oxidative coupling of methane [1], aromatization
of propane [2] and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
[3,4]. The authors have investigated the effect of CO2
on the dehydrogenation of propane over several sup-
ported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has pro-
moting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

Experimental
Several supported Cr2O3 catalysts were prepared by
an impregnation method using an aqueous solution of
chromium nitrate. The supports used were g-Al2O3,
active carbon (AC) and SiO2. The catalysts were
calcined at 823 K in air for 2 h. The catalysts were
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD
patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed the
diffraction lines ascribed only to the phases of respec-
tive supports. In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase
and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed. The
post-reactor XRD was performed. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and
Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed,
but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in
Cr2O3/SiO2. The dehydrogenation of C3H8 was con-
ducted under atmospheric pressure of C3H8CO2(Ar)
at 823 K by using a xed bed ow reactor. TPR/D
studies were carried out to elucidate the behavior of
Cr2O3 in the catalyst during treatment with H2 and

Effects of CO2 on dehydrogenation of C3H8
The main products of the conversion of C3H8 in the
presence of Ar were C3H6 and H2, while those in the
presence of CO2 were C3H6, H2, and CO, as shown in
Table 1. Since the selectivities for C3H6 were more
than 90%, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6
should be the main reaction both in the presence of
CO2 and in the absence of CO2. The yield of H2CO
was found to be higher than C3H6 yield over all
catalysts used in the present study. There might be
three possible routes for CO formation; the rst one
via the successive reactions (1) and (2), the second one
via the reaction (3) and the third one via CO2 reform-
ing of C3H8 (reaction (4)) as shown below:
C3H8  C3H6  H2

(2)
C3H8  CO2  C3H6  CO  H2O

C3H8  3CO2  6CO  4H2

Fig. 1 shows the activities of several supported
Cr2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in
the presence of CO2 as well as in the absence of CO2.
The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much
lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence
of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent
of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity
of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was
surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the
absence of CO2.
Fig. 2 shows the selectivities for H2 and CO as a
function of C3H6 yield. In the case of Cr2O3/Al2O3
catalyst, the selectivity for H2 decreased with an
increase in C3H6 yield, whereas the selectivity for CO
increased with an increase in C3H6 yield, as shown in
Fig. 2(A). On the other hand, the selectivities of
Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change
irrespective of C3H6 yield, as shown in Fig. 2(B).
These ndings suggest that CO might be formed via
successive reactions (1) and (2) over Cr2O3/Al2O3
catalyst, whereas both the reactions (1) and (3) could
take place simultaneously over Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.
In order to study the contribution of CO2 in the
conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 cat-
alyst, catalytic tests with alternate feeds of C3H8/Ar
and C3H8/CO2/Ar were carried out. The results shown
in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that the presence of CO2
markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic
performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting
role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/
SiO2 catalyst.

Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction
in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2
decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/
SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that

the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles
might have an important role in the promoting effect
of CO2.
The effect of CO2 addition on the deactivation of a
Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was also examined (Fig. 5). The
reaction conditions for both the cases with and without
CO2 were the same except the catalyst weight, which
was 50% larger in the case of the reaction without
CO2, in order to obtain the same initial yield of C3H6.
The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less
in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2.
This nding suggests that the addition of CO2 could
suppress the deactivation of the catalyst.

TPR/D result
Fig. 6 shows TPR/D proles during various treat-
ments of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The Cr2O3 was found to
be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were
observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with
H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2.
This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the
surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. Accordingly, these
ndings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/
SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydro-

genation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the
surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxi-
dized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.
3.3.
Pulse reaction
A pulse reaction technique was employed for exam-
ining the initial activity of the catalyst. Fig. 7 shows
the conversion of C3H8 and the yield of hydrocarbon
products as a function of the number of C3H8 pulses on
Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The yield of C3H6 reached a
maximum of about 21% at the second pulse. After
the second pulse, the yield of C3H6 slightly decreased
with increasing pulse number. The yield of C3H6
decreased to 17% by the treatment of the catalyst
with H2 after fth pulse, and remained constant from
sixth pulse to ninth pulse. The treatment of the catalyst
with CO2 after ninth pulse raised the yield of C3H6 to
19%, but the yield of C3H6 gradually decreased with
increasing pulse number from tenth pulse. These
ndings conrm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2
catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation
of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst. The results obtained
from pulse reaction studies and from TPR/D studies
might explain slower deactivation of the catalyst dur-
ing the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
Furthermore, pulse reaction studies were performed
for comparing between the yield of C3H6 during the
reaction in a stream of CO2 and in a stream of He. The
C3H6 yield at the rst pulse and the second pulse in the
presence of CO2 was found to be higher than those in
the absence of CO2. This strongly suggests that CO2
could enhance the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8
over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. This promoting effect of
CO2 might occur at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and
SiO2 particles.

Conclusion
Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydro-
genation performance was only observed on SiO2
supported catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2
over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield
of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. The
partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is
active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the
presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might
be maintained to be partially oxidized during the
reaction.
