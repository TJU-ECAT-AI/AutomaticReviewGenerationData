[1] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

[4] "These ndings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into how reducibility and support materials influence catalyst performance for a related reaction - CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane over Cr2O3 catalysts.

The study shows that SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts uniquely benefit from CO2 promotion, while Al2O3 and carbon-supported catalysts do not. This suggests the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and CO2 interaction.

Regarding reducibility, the research indicates that partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is more active for propane dehydrogenation than fully reduced Cr2O3. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction, which may explain its promoting effect.

These findings suggest that for optimal catalyst performance in CO2-promoted dehydrogenation reactions:
1. The choice of support material is critical and can dramatically affect catalyst behavior.
2. Maintaining a partially oxidized state of the active metal oxide is important.
3. CO2 can play a role in preserving this optimal oxidation state during the reaction.

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 catalysts, similar principles may apply to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The research highlights the importance of carefully considering support materials and understanding the redox behavior of catalysts in the presence of CO2 to optimize catalytic systems for such processes.

这篇文献并未直接讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。但是，它为一个相关反应提供了见解 - 即Cr2O3催化剂上CO2促进的丙烷脱氢反应，特别是还原性和载体材料如何影响催化剂性能。

研究表明，只有SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂能从CO2促进中受益，而Al2O3和碳负载的催化剂则不能。这表明载体材料在决定催化剂性能和CO2相互作用方面起着至关重要的作用。

关于还原性，研究表明，部分氧化的SiO2负载Cr2O3比完全还原的Cr2O3对丙烷脱氢更活跃。CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态，这可能解释了它的促进作用。

这些发现表明，要在CO2促进的脱氢反应中获得最佳的催化剂性能：
1. 载体材料的选择至关重要，可以显著影响催化剂的行为。
2. 保持活性金属氧化物的部分氧化状态很重要。
3. CO2可以在反应过程中起到保持这种最佳氧化状态的作用。

虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3催化剂上，但类似的原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂。研究强调了仔细考虑载体材料的重要性，以及理解CO2存在下催化剂的氧化还原行为，以优化此类过程的催化系统。
