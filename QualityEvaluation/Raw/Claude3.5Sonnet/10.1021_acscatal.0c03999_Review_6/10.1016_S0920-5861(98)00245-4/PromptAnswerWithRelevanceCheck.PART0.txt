[1] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

[4] "These ndings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into how reducibility and support materials influence catalyst performance for a related reaction - CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane over Cr2O3 catalysts.

The study shows that SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts uniquely benefit from CO2 promotion, while Al2O3 and carbon-supported catalysts do not. This suggests the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance and CO2 interaction.

Regarding reducibility, the research indicates that partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is more active for propane dehydrogenation than fully reduced Cr2O3. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction, which may explain its promoting effect.

These findings suggest that for optimal catalyst performance in CO2-promoted dehydrogenation reactions:
1. The choice of support material is critical and can dramatically affect catalyst behavior.
2. Maintaining a partially oxidized state of the active metal oxide is important.
3. CO2 can play a role in preserving this optimal oxidation state during the reaction.

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 catalysts, similar principles may apply to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The research highlights the importance of carefully considering support materials and understanding the redox behavior of catalysts in the presence of CO2 to optimize catalytic systems for such processes.

这篇文献并未直接讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。但是，它为一个相关反应提供了见解 - 即Cr2O3催化剂上CO2促进的丙烷脱氢反应，特别是还原性和载体材料如何影响催化剂性能。

研究表明，只有SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂能从CO2促进中受益，而Al2O3和碳负载的催化剂则不能。这表明载体材料在决定催化剂性能和CO2相互作用方面起着至关重要的作用。

关于还原性，研究表明，部分氧化的SiO2负载Cr2O3比完全还原的Cr2O3对丙烷脱氢更活跃。CO2有助于在反应过程中维持这种部分氧化状态，这可能解释了它的促进作用。

这些发现表明，要在CO2促进的脱氢反应中获得最佳的催化剂性能：
1. 载体材料的选择至关重要，可以显著影响催化剂的行为。
2. 保持活性金属氧化物的部分氧化状态很重要。
3. CO2可以在反应过程中起到保持这种最佳氧化状态的作用。

虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3催化剂上，但类似的原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂。研究强调了仔细考虑载体材料的重要性，以及理解CO2存在下催化剂的氧化还原行为，以优化此类过程的催化系统。

[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[2] "The post-reactor XRD was performed. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed, but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in Cr2O3/SiO2."

[3] "TPR/D studies were carried out to elucidate the behavior of Cr2O3 in the catalyst during treatment with H2 and CO2."

[4] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

The study focuses on Cr2O3-based catalysts rather than Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the results:

1. The support material significantly influences catalyst performance. SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed promoting effects with CO2, while Al2O3 and active carbon supports did not.

2. The reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role. CO2 can partially oxidize the surface of Cr2O3 on SiO2 support, maintaining it in a partially oxidized state during the reaction. This partially oxidized state is more active for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The proposed mechanism involves CO2 acting as a mild oxidant, preventing complete reduction of the catalyst surface and maintaining its activity.

4. To optimize catalytic systems, the choice of support material is critical. The interaction between the active metal oxide and the support influences the catalyst's redox properties and its ability to utilize CO2 effectively.

5. The boundaries between the metal oxide and support particles may be important for the promoting effect of CO2, suggesting that optimizing the dispersion of the active phase on the support could enhance catalyst performance.

These findings, although specific to Cr2O3 catalysts, provide insights into how support materials and reducibility can influence catalyst performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, which may be applicable to the development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for similar processes.

虽然这项研究主要集中在Cr2O3基催化剂而非Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应，但我们仍可从结果中得到一些见解：

1. 载体材料对催化剂性能有显著影响。SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出促进效应，而Al2O3和活性炭载体则没有。

2. 催化剂的可还原性起着关键作用。CO2可以部分氧化SiO2载体上Cr2O3的表面，在反应过程中保持其部分氧化状态。这种部分氧化状态对丙烷脱氢更为活跃。

3. 提出的机理涉及CO2作为温和的氧化剂，防止催化剂表面完全还原，从而维持其活性。

4. 要优化催化系统，载体材料的选择至关重要。活性金属氧化物与载体之间的相互作用影响催化剂的氧化还原性质及其有效利用CO2的能力。

5. 金属氧化物与载体颗粒之间的界面可能对CO2的促进效应很重要，这表明优化活性相在载体上的分散可能会提高催化剂性能。

这些发现虽然特定于Cr2O3催化剂，但为载体材料和可还原性如何影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂性能提供了见解，这可能适用于开发类似过程的Fe氧化物基催化剂。

The literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into how reducibility and support materials affect catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which may be relevant to understanding similar systems.

The study shows that the reducibility of the catalyst (Cr2O3 in this case) plays a crucial role in its performance. The catalyst can be reduced by H2 and partially re-oxidized by CO2, maintaining a partially oxidized state during the reaction. This partially oxidized state is found to be more active for propane dehydrogenation.

The support material is also critical, as the CO2 promotion effect was only observed with SiO2-supported catalysts, not with Al2O3 or active carbon supports. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support is important for the CO2 promoting effect.

These findings imply a reaction mechanism where CO2 helps maintain the catalyst in a partially oxidized state, which is more active for the dehydrogenation reaction. This mechanism could involve redox cycles between the catalyst and CO2, with the support material playing a role in facilitating this process.

To optimize catalytic systems for similar processes, these insights suggest focusing on:
1. Selecting support materials that enable CO2 promotion effects
2. Tailoring the reducibility of the active metal oxide to maintain a partially oxidized state
3. Optimizing the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support material

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 catalysts, similar principles might apply to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, though further research would be needed to confirm this.

该文献并没有直接讨论铁氧化物基催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而，它提供了关于可还原性和载体材料如何影响在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的见解，这可能与理解类似系统相关。

研究表明，催化剂的可还原性（在本例中为Cr2O3）在其性能中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂可以被H2还原，并被CO2部分再氧化，在反应过程中保持部分氧化状态。这种部分氧化状态被发现对丙烷脱氢更加活跃。

载体材料也很关键，因为CO2促进效应只在SiO2负载的催化剂上观察到，而在Al2O3或活性炭载体上没有观察到。这表明活性金属氧化物与载体之间的相互作用对CO2促进效应很重要。

这些发现暗示了一种反应机制，其中CO2有助于将催化剂保持在部分氧化状态，这对脱氢反应更加活跃。这种机制可能涉及催化剂和CO2之间的氧化还原循环，载体材料在促进这一过程中发挥作用。

为优化类似过程的催化系统，这些见解建议关注：
1. 选择能够实现CO2促进效应的载体材料
2. 调整活性金属氧化物的可还原性以保持部分氧化状态
3. 优化活性金属氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用

虽然这项研究集中在Cr2O3催化剂上，但类似的原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应中的铁氧化物基催化剂，尽管需要进一步的研究来确认这一点。

The study shows that the reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its performance. The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was found to be more active when partially oxidized rather than fully reduced. CO2 was able to oxidize some part of the Cr2O3 surface, maintaining it in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which enhanced catalytic activity and stability.

The support material was also found to be critical. The promoting effects of CO2 were only observed on SiO2-supported catalysts, not on Al2O3 or active carbon supports. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support is crucial for enabling CO2 promotion.

These findings suggest a mechanism where the partially oxidized state of the metal oxide and its interaction with the support material are key factors in the catalyst's performance. The ability of CO2 to maintain this partially oxidized state appears to be central to its promoting effect.

For optimizing catalytic systems, these results suggest that choosing an appropriate support material and tailoring the oxidation state of the active metal oxide are crucial strategies. While this study focused on Cr2O3 catalysts, similar principles might apply to Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, although further research would be needed to confirm this.

[1] "The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed the diffraction lines ascribed only to the phases of respective supports. In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed."

[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[3] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

The study does not directly investigate Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into how support materials and reducibility influence the performance of Cr2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation with CO2, which may be applicable to similar catalytic systems.

The support material significantly affects catalyst performance. Cr2O3/SiO2 showed enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, while Cr2O3/Al2O3 showed decreased activity, and Cr2O3/AC was unaffected. This suggests that the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

Reducibility is also important. The study shows that Cr2O3 can be reduced by H2 and re-oxidized by CO2. The partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 on SiO2 was found to be more active for propane dehydrogenation. CO2 helps maintain this partially oxidized state during the reaction, which may explain the enhanced activity and stability of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

These findings suggest a reaction mechanism where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, maintaining the active state of the catalyst. This could be applicable to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. To optimize catalytic systems for this process, one should consider:

1. Selecting appropriate support materials that enhance the catalyst's interaction with CO2.
2. Balancing the reducibility of the active metal oxide to maintain a partially oxidized state.
3. Utilizing CO2 as both a reactant and a catalyst regeneration agent.

While this study focuses on Cr2O3 catalysts, the principles of support material selection and redox behavior could guide the development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

2. 平衡活性金属氧化物的可还原性，以维持部分氧化状态。
3. 利用CO2作为反应物和催化剂再生剂。
