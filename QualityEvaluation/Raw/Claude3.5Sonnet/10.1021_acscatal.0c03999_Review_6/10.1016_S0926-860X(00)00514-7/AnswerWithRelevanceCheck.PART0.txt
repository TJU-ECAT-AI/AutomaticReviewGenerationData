          [1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."

[4] "Our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation between the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."

[5] "The type of support had a stronger influence on the catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as support showing extremely low ash content."

[6] "The alkaline metal oxide promoters lithium, potassium and sodium raised the activity of the catalyst Fe/D-90"

[7] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

[8] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."

[9] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14]"

[10] "The introduction of alkaline metal oxide promoters to iron oxide supported D-90 protected the catalyst partly against the loss of specific surface area"

[11] "No strong effects of the changes of pretreatment conditions on the catalytic performance were observed at 550C"

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Key findings include:

1. Support material: Active carbon, particularly low-ash content varieties like D-90, was found to be the most effective support. Other carbonaceous and inorganic supports showed very low or no activity.

2. Iron content: The optimal iron content was found to be around 5 wt% for all catalysts tested.

3. Alkali metal promoters: The addition of alkali metal oxides (Li, Na, K) significantly enhanced catalyst activity. The optimal alkali metal to Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1.

4. Active phase: The formation of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface is proposed as the active phase, supporting an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift reaction.

5. Surface area: Alkali metal promoters helped maintain the catalyst's specific surface area during reactions.

6. Pretreatment: Changes in pretreatment conditions did not strongly affect catalytic performance at 550°C, suggesting that the iron oxide's reducibility may not be a critical factor.

These insights suggest that the reaction mechanism involves the formation of an active potassium ferrite phase on the carbon support. The high performance of active carbon supports may be due to their ability to stabilize iron oxide particles and promote the formation of the active ferrite phase.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, focus should be on:
1. Using high-quality, low-ash content active carbon supports
2. Maintaining an optimal iron content around 5 wt%
3. Incorporating alkali metal promoters at a 0.1 atomic ratio to iron
4. Ensuring conditions that promote the formation and stability of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface
5. Maintaining high surface area during the reaction

These findings highlight the complex interplay between the iron oxide, carbon support, and promoters in creating active sites for the CO2-ODHP reaction, emphasizing the importance of both the support material and the active phase composition in determining catalyst performance.

          Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和载体材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。主要发现包括：

1. 载体材料：活性炭，特别是低灰分含量的品种如D-90，被发现是最有效的载体。其他碳质和无机载体显示出很低或没有活性。

2. 铁含量：所有测试的催化剂中，最佳铁含量约为5 wt%。

3. 碱金属促进剂：添加碱金属氧化物（Li、Na、K）显著提高了催化剂活性。最佳的碱金属与Fe的原子比被发现为0.1。

4. 活性相：提出在催化剂表面形成钾铁氧体作为活性相，支持氧化脱氢机理而非简单的逆水气变换反应。

5. 比表面积：碱金属促进剂有助于在反应过程中保持催化剂的比表面积。

6. 预处理：在550°C下，预处理条件的变化对催化性能影响不大，这表明氧化铁的还原性可能不是关键因素。

这些见解表明，反应机理涉及在碳载体上形成活性钾铁氧体相。活性炭载体的高性能可能是由于其能够稳定铁氧化物颗粒并促进活性铁氧体相的形成。

为了优化此过程的催化系统，应该关注：
1. 使用高质量、低灰分含量的活性炭载体
2. 保持最佳铁含量在5 wt%左右
3. 以0.1的原子比引入碱金属促进剂
4. 确保条件有利于在催化剂表面形成和稳定钾铁氧体
5. 在反应过程中保持高比表面积

这些发现突出了铁氧化物、碳载体和促进剂之间在创建CO2-ODHP反应活性位点方面的复杂相互作用，强调了载体材料和活性相组成对确定催化剂性能的重要性。
