[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."

[3] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."

[4] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14]"

The literature provides several insights into how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material, particularly active carbon with low ash content (D-90).

2. The optimal iron content was 5 wt% for all catalysts tested.

3. Alkali metal oxide promotion, particularly at an alkali metal to Fe atomic ratio of 0.1, significantly enhanced catalyst activity.

4. The formation of potassium ferrite appears to be crucial for the active phase of the catalyst.

These findings suggest that the reaction mechanism likely involves the formation of an active potassium ferrite phase on the carbon support, rather than solely relying on the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The high performance of active carbon supports may be due to their ability to stabilize iron oxide particles and promote the formation of the active ferrite phase.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, researchers should focus on:

1. Using high-surface-area, low-ash content active carbon supports.
2. Maintaining an optimal iron content around 5 wt%.
3. Incorporating alkali metal promoters, particularly at a 0.1 atomic ratio to iron.
4. Ensuring conditions that promote the formation and stability of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface.

These insights highlight the importance of both the support material and the active phase composition in determining catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.

文献为Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能提供了几个见解：

1. 活性炭被发现是最有效的载体材料，特别是低灰分含量的活性炭（D-90）。

2. 所有测试的催化剂中，最佳的铁含量为5 wt%。

3. 碱金属氧化物的促进作用，特别是在碱金属与Fe的原子比为0.1时，显著提高了催化剂活性。

4. 钾铁氧体的形成似乎对催化剂的活性相至关重要。

这些发现表明，反应机理可能涉及在碳载体上形成活性钾铁氧体相，而不仅仅依赖于逆水气变换反应。活性炭载体的高性能可能是由于其能够稳定铁氧化物颗粒并促进活性铁氧体相的形成。

为了优化此过程的催化系统，研究人员应该关注：

1. 使用高比表面积、低灰分含量的活性炭载体。
2. 保持最佳铁含量在5 wt%左右。
3. 引入碱金属促进剂，特别是与铁的原子比为0.1。
4. 确保条件有利于在催化剂表面形成和稳定钾铁氧体。

这些见解突出了载体材料和活性相组成对CO2-ODHP反应的催化剂性能的重要性。
