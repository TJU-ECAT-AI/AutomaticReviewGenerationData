[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."

[4] "Our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation between the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."

The study found that active carbon was the only effective support material for Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, with other carbonaceous and inorganic supports proving ineffective. The reducibility of the Fe oxide was enhanced by the addition of alkali metal promoters, particularly at an alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio of 0.1. This improved performance correlates with the formation of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface, supporting an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism rather than the reverse water-gas shift reaction. These findings suggest that optimizing the Fe oxide-alkali metal interaction on an active carbon support is crucial for developing effective catalysts for this process.

研究发现，活性炭是CO2-ODHP反应中Fe氧化物催化剂唯一有效的载体材料，其他碳质和无机载体均无效。通过添加碱金属助剂，特别是在碱金属/Fe原子比为0.1时，Fe氧化物的可还原性得到了提高。这种性能改善与催化剂表面钾铁氧化物的形成相关，支持氧化脱氢机理而非逆水煤气反应机理。这些发现表明，在活性炭载体上优化Fe氧化物-碱金属相互作用对于开发该过程的有效催化剂至关重要。
