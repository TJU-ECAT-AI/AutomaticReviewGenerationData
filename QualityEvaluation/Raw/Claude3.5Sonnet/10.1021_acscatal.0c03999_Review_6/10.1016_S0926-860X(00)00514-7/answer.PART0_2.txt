[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The type of support had a stronger influence on the catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as support showing extremely low ash content."

The literature provides several insights into how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material, with other carbonaceous and inorganic supports showing very low activity. 

2. The type of active carbon support had a stronger influence on catalytic activity than the iron concentration, with the best results achieved using active carbon D-90, which had extremely low ash content.

3. Alkali metal oxide promoters (Li, Na, K) increased the activity of the Fe/active carbon catalysts.

4. The proposed reaction mechanism involves surface ferrite as the active site, with ethylbenzene being oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is then reoxidized by CO2.

These findings suggest that the reducibility of the iron oxide catalyst is enhanced by the active carbon support and alkali metal promoters. The active carbon likely facilitates electron transfer and provides a high surface area for the active iron species. The alkali promoters may help stabilize the active iron sites and enhance their reducibility.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, the focus should be on:
1. Using high-quality active carbon supports with low ash content
2. Optimizing the iron loading (around 5 wt% was found to be optimal)
3. Adding appropriate amounts of alkali metal promoters (with an atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron of about 0.1)
4. Ensuring a good dispersion of iron and promoter species on the carbon support surface

These insights support a mechanism involving redox cycling of iron species, facilitated by the carbon support and promoters, rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift reaction.

文献为Fe氧化物基催化剂的还原性和载体材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能提供了几个见解：

1. 活性炭被发现是最有效的载体材料，其他碳质和无机载体显示出很低的活性。

2. 活性炭载体的类型对催化活性的影响比铁的浓度更大，使用灰分含量极低的活性炭D-90获得了最佳结果。

3. 碱金属氧化物促进剂（Li，Na，K）增加了Fe/活性炭催化剂的活性。

4. 提出的反应机理涉及表面铁氧化物作为活性位点，乙苯被铁氧化物氧化成苯乙烯，然后铁氧化物被CO2再氧化。

这些发现表明，活性炭载体和碱金属促进剂增强了氧化铁催化剂的还原性。活性炭可能促进电子转移并为活性铁物种提供高比表面积。碱金属促进剂可能有助于稳定活性铁位点并增强其还原性。

为了优化这个过程的催化系统，应该关注：
1. 使用低灰分含量的高质量活性炭载体
2. 优化铁的负载量（发现约5 wt%是最佳的）
3. 添加适量的碱金属促进剂（碱金属与铁的原子比约为0.1）
4. 确保铁和促进剂物种在碳载体表面上良好分散

这些见解支持了一种涉及铁物种氧化还原循环的机理，这种循环由碳载体和促进剂促进，而不是简单的逆水气变换反应。
