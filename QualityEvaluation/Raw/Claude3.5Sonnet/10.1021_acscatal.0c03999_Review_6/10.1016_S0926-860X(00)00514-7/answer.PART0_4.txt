The literature provides some insights into the influence of reducibility and support materials on Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions:

Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material, with other carbonaceous and inorganic supports yielding inactive catalysts. The type of active carbon used significantly impacted catalytic performance, with the lowest ash content support (D-90) giving the best results.

Alkali metal oxide promoters improved the activity of iron oxide catalysts supported on active carbon. This was attributed to the formation of surface ferrites, which are proposed to be the active sites. The alkali promoters also helped maintain the catalyst surface area during reaction.

The reducibility of the iron oxide does not appear to be a major factor, as pretreatment conditions had little effect on catalytic performance. This suggests the oxidation state of iron may not change significantly during the reaction.

These findings support an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism involving surface ferrites rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift reaction. To optimize these catalysts, focus should be on using high purity active carbon supports, incorporating alkali promoters at an optimal ratio, and maintaining high surface area during reaction. The iron loading and choice of alkali promoter can be tuned to maximize activity and selectivity.

文献为Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的还原性和载体材料的影响提供了一些见解：

活性炭被发现是最有效的载体材料，其他碳质和无机载体产生的催化剂不活跃。使用的活性炭类型显著影响催化性能，灰分含量最低的载体(D-90)给出了最好的结果。

碱金属氧化物促进剂改善了负载在活性炭上的氧化铁催化剂的活性。这归因于表面铁氧体的形成，它们被认为是活性位点。碱促进剂还有助于在反应过程中保持催化剂的表面积。

氧化铁的还原性似乎不是一个主要因素，因为预处理条件对催化性能影响不大。这表明在反应过程中铁的氧化态可能不会发生显著变化。

这些发现支持涉及表面铁氧体的氧化脱氢机理，而不是简单的逆水煤气反应。为了优化这些催化剂，应该关注使用高纯度活性炭载体，以最佳比例引入碱促进剂，并在反应过程中保持高比表面积。可以调整铁的负载量和碱促进剂的选择，以最大化活性和选择性。
