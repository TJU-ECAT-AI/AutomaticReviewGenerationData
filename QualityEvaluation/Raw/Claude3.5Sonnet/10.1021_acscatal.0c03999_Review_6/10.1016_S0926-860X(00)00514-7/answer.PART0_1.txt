[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The iron oxide catalyst showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene varying from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C."

[3] "For all catalysts supported by Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, SiO2/ZrO2 and carbonized polymers the ethylbenzene conversion was lower than 3%."

[4] "The alkaline metal oxide promoters lithium, potassium and sodium raised the activity of the catalyst Fe/D-90"

[5] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

The literature provides several insights into how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Support material is crucial: Active carbon was found to be the most effective support, while inorganic supports like Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, and SiO2/ZrO2 resulted in very low catalytic activity.

2. Iron oxide showed the highest performance among tested transition metal oxides, with ethylbenzene conversion increasing significantly with temperature.

3. Alkali metal oxide promoters (Li, Na, K) enhanced the activity of Fe/active carbon catalysts, suggesting a role in modifying the active sites.

4. The proposed reaction mechanism involves surface ferrite as an active site, as suggested by Sugino et al.

These findings suggest that the reducibility of iron oxide, facilitated by the active carbon support and alkali metal promoters, is crucial for catalytic performance. The carbon support likely provides a high surface area and may participate in the reaction mechanism. The alkali promoters may help in forming active ferrite sites or modifying the electronic properties of iron oxide.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, focus should be on:
1. Using high-surface-area active carbon supports
2. Optimizing iron oxide loading (around 5 wt% was found optimal in this study)
3. Incorporating appropriate amounts of alkali metal promoters
4. Further investigating the role of surface ferrite and the oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism

These insights support a complex interplay between the iron oxide, carbon support, and promoters in creating active sites for the CO2-ODHP reaction, rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift mechanism.

文献为Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能提供了几个见解：

1. 载体材料至关重要：活性炭被发现是最有效的载体，而Al2O3、ZnO、TiO2、WO3和SiO2/ZrO2等无机载体导致的催化活性很低。

2. 在测试的过渡金属氧化物中，氧化铁表现出最高的性能，随着温度的升高，乙苯转化率显著增加。

3. 碱金属氧化物促进剂（Li、Na、K）增强了Fe/活性炭催化剂的活性，表明它们在修饰活性位点方面发挥作用。

4. Sugino等人提出的反应机理涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点。

这些发现表明，由活性炭载体和碱金属促进剂促进的氧化铁的可还原性对催化性能至关重要。碳载体可能提供高比表面积，并可能参与反应机理。碱金属促进剂可能有助于形成活性铁酸盐位点或修饰氧化铁的电子性质。

为优化此过程的催化系统，应关注：
1. 使用高比表面积的活性炭载体
2. 优化氧化铁负载量（本研究发现约5 wt%为最佳）
3. 添加适量的碱金属促进剂
4. 进一步研究表面铁酸盐的作用和氧化脱氢机理

这些见解支持了氧化铁、碳载体和促进剂之间在创建CO2-ODHP反应活性位点方面的复杂相互作用，而不是简单的反水气变换机理。
