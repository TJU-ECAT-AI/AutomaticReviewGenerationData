[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."

[4] "Our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation between the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."

</quotes>

The study found that active carbon was the only effective support material for Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, with other carbonaceous and inorganic supports proving ineffective. The reducibility of the Fe oxide was enhanced by the addition of alkali metal promoters, particularly at an alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio of 0.1. This improved performance correlates with the formation of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface, supporting an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism rather than the reverse water-gas shift reaction. These findings suggest that optimizing the Fe oxide-alkali metal interaction on an active carbon support is crucial for developing effective catalysts for this process.

研究发现，活性炭是CO2-ODHP反应中Fe氧化物催化剂唯一有效的载体材料，其他碳质和无机载体均无效。通过添加碱金属助剂，特别是在碱金属/Fe原子比为0.1时，Fe氧化物的可还原性得到了提高。这种性能改善与催化剂表面钾铁氧化物的形成相关，支持氧化脱氢机理而非逆水煤气反应机理。这些发现表明，在活性炭载体上优化Fe氧化物-碱金属相互作用对于开发该过程的有效催化剂至关重要。

[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The iron oxide catalyst showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene varying from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C."

[3] "For all catalysts supported by Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, SiO2/ZrO2 and carbonized polymers the ethylbenzene conversion was lower than 3%."

[4] "The alkaline metal oxide promoters lithium, potassium and sodium raised the activity of the catalyst Fe/D-90"

[5] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

</quotes>

The literature provides several insights into how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Support material is crucial: Active carbon was found to be the most effective support, while inorganic supports like Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, and SiO2/ZrO2 resulted in very low catalytic activity.

2. Iron oxide showed the highest performance among tested transition metal oxides, with ethylbenzene conversion increasing significantly with temperature.

3. Alkali metal oxide promoters (Li, Na, K) enhanced the activity of Fe/active carbon catalysts, suggesting a role in modifying the active sites.

4. The proposed reaction mechanism involves surface ferrite as an active site, as suggested by Sugino et al.

These findings suggest that the reducibility of iron oxide, facilitated by the active carbon support and alkali metal promoters, is crucial for catalytic performance. The carbon support likely provides a high surface area and may participate in the reaction mechanism. The alkali promoters may help in forming active ferrite sites or modifying the electronic properties of iron oxide.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, focus should be on:
1. Using high-surface-area active carbon supports
2. Optimizing iron oxide loading (around 5 wt% was found optimal in this study)
3. Incorporating appropriate amounts of alkali metal promoters
4. Further investigating the role of surface ferrite and the oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism

These insights support a complex interplay between the iron oxide, carbon support, and promoters in creating active sites for the CO2-ODHP reaction, rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift mechanism.

文献为Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能提供了几个见解：

1. 载体材料至关重要：活性炭被发现是最有效的载体，而Al2O3、ZnO、TiO2、WO3和SiO2/ZrO2等无机载体导致的催化活性很低。

2. 在测试的过渡金属氧化物中，氧化铁表现出最高的性能，随着温度的升高，乙苯转化率显著增加。

3. 碱金属氧化物促进剂（Li、Na、K）增强了Fe/活性炭催化剂的活性，表明它们在修饰活性位点方面发挥作用。

4. Sugino等人提出的反应机理涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点。

这些发现表明，由活性炭载体和碱金属促进剂促进的氧化铁的可还原性对催化性能至关重要。碳载体可能提供高比表面积，并可能参与反应机理。碱金属促进剂可能有助于形成活性铁酸盐位点或修饰氧化铁的电子性质。

为优化此过程的催化系统，应关注：
1. 使用高比表面积的活性炭载体
2. 优化氧化铁负载量（本研究发现约5 wt%为最佳）
3. 添加适量的碱金属促进剂
4. 进一步研究表面铁酸盐的作用和氧化脱氢机理

这些见解支持了氧化铁、碳载体和促进剂之间在创建CO2-ODHP反应活性位点方面的复杂相互作用，而不是简单的反水气变换机理。

These findings suggest that the reducibility of the iron oxide catalyst is enhanced by the active carbon support and alkali metal promoters. The active carbon likely facilitates electron transfer and provides a high surface area for the active iron species. The alkali promoters may help stabilize the active iron sites and enhance their reducibility.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, the focus should be on:
1. Using high-quality active carbon supports with low ash content
2. Optimizing the iron loading (around 5 wt% was found to be optimal)
3. Adding appropriate amounts of alkali metal promoters (with an atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron of about 0.1)
4. Ensuring a good dispersion of iron and promoter species on the carbon support surface

These insights support a mechanism involving redox cycling of iron species, facilitated by the carbon support and promoters, rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift reaction.

The literature provides several insights into how the reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material, particularly active carbon with low ash content (D-90).

2. The optimal iron content was 5 wt% for all catalysts tested.

3. Alkali metal oxide promotion, particularly at an alkali metal to Fe atomic ratio of 0.1, significantly enhanced catalyst activity.

4. The formation of potassium ferrite appears to be crucial for the active phase of the catalyst.

These findings suggest that the reaction mechanism likely involves the formation of an active potassium ferrite phase on the carbon support, rather than solely relying on the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The high performance of active carbon supports may be due to their ability to stabilize iron oxide particles and promote the formation of the active ferrite phase.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, researchers should focus on:

1. Using high-surface-area, low-ash content active carbon supports.
2. Maintaining an optimal iron content around 5 wt%.
3. Incorporating alkali metal promoters, particularly at a 0.1 atomic ratio to iron.
4. Ensuring conditions that promote the formation and stability of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface.

These insights highlight the importance of both the support material and the active phase composition in determining catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.

The literature provides some insights into the influence of reducibility and support materials on Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions:

Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material, with other carbonaceous and inorganic supports yielding inactive catalysts. The type of active carbon used significantly impacted catalytic performance, with the lowest ash content support (D-90) giving the best results.

Alkali metal oxide promoters improved the activity of iron oxide catalysts supported on active carbon. This was attributed to the formation of surface ferrites, which are proposed to be the active sites. The alkali promoters also helped maintain the catalyst surface area during reaction.

The reducibility of the iron oxide does not appear to be a major factor, as pretreatment conditions had little effect on catalytic performance. This suggests the oxidation state of iron may not change significantly during the reaction.

These findings support an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism involving surface ferrites rather than a simple reverse water-gas shift reaction. To optimize these catalysts, focus should be on using high purity active carbon supports, incorporating alkali promoters at an optimal ratio, and maintaining high surface area during reaction. The iron loading and choice of alkali promoter can be tuned to maximize activity and selectivity.

文献为Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的还原性和载体材料的影响提供了一些见解：

活性炭被发现是最有效的载体材料，其他碳质和无机载体产生的催化剂不活跃。使用的活性炭类型显著影响催化性能，灰分含量最低的载体(D-90)给出了最好的结果。

碱金属氧化物促进剂改善了负载在活性炭上的氧化铁催化剂的活性。这归因于表面铁氧体的形成，它们被认为是活性位点。碱促进剂还有助于在反应过程中保持催化剂的表面积。

氧化铁的还原性似乎不是一个主要因素，因为预处理条件对催化性能影响不大。这表明在反应过程中铁的氧化态可能不会发生显著变化。

这些发现支持涉及表面铁氧体的氧化脱氢机理，而不是简单的逆水煤气反应。为了优化这些催化剂，应该关注使用高纯度活性炭载体，以最佳比例引入碱促进剂，并在反应过程中保持高比表面积。可以调整铁的负载量和碱促进剂的选择，以最大化活性和选择性。
