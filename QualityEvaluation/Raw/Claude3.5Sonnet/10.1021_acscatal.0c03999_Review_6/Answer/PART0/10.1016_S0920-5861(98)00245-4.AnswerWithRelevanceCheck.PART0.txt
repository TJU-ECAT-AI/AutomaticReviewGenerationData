          [1] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

[4] "These ndings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[5] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[6] "The post-reactor XRD was performed. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed, but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in Cr2O3/SiO2."

[7] "TPR/D studies were carried out to elucidate the behavior of Cr2O3 in the catalyst during treatment with H2 and CO2."

[8] "The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed the diffraction lines ascribed only to the phases of respective supports. In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed."

[9] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

          Although the study does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions, it provides valuable insights into how reducibility and support materials influence catalyst performance in CO2-promoted dehydrogenation reactions, which may be applicable to similar catalytic systems.

1. Influence of support materials:
- The choice of support material significantly affects catalyst performance.
- SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed unique benefits from CO2 promotion, while Al2O3 and carbon-supported catalysts did not.
- The interaction between the active metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior and CO2 interaction.

2. Reducibility and oxidation state:
- The reducibility of the catalyst is crucial for its performance.
- Partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is more active for propane dehydrogenation than fully reduced Cr2O3.
- CO2 can partially oxidize the surface of Cr2O3 on SiO2 support, maintaining it in a partially oxidized state during the reaction.

3. Proposed reaction mechanism:
- CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, preventing complete reduction of the catalyst surface and maintaining its activity.
- The partially oxidized state of the metal oxide and its interaction with the support material are key factors in the catalyst's performance.
- The ability of CO2 to maintain this partially oxidized state appears to be central to its promoting effect.

4. Optimization strategies for catalytic systems:
- Carefully select support materials that enable CO2 promotion effects.
- Tailor the reducibility of the active metal oxide to maintain a partially oxidized state.
- Optimize the interaction between the active metal oxide and the support material.
- Consider the boundaries between the metal oxide and support particles for enhancing the promoting effect of CO2.

While these findings are specific to Cr2O3 catalysts, similar principles may apply to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The research highlights the importance of carefully considering support materials and understanding the redox behavior of catalysts in the presence of CO2 to optimize catalytic systems for such processes.

          虽然这项研究并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应，但它为我们提供了关于还原性和载体材料如何影响CO2促进的脱氢反应中催化剂性能的有价值见解，这些见解可能适用于类似的催化系统。

1. 载体材料的影响：
- 载体材料的选择显著影响催化剂性能。
- SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂表现出独特的CO2促进效应，而Al2O3和碳负载的催化剂则没有。
- 活性金属氧化物与载体之间的相互作用在决定催化行为和CO2相互作用方面起着关键作用。

2. 可还原性和氧化状态：
- 催化剂的可还原性对其性能至关重要。
- 部分氧化的SiO2负载Cr2O3比完全还原的Cr2O3对丙烷脱氢更活跃。
- CO2可以部分氧化SiO2载体上Cr2O3的表面，在反应过程中保持其部分氧化状态。

3. 提出的反应机制：
- CO2作为温和的氧化剂，防止催化剂表面完全还原，从而维持其活性。
- 金属氧化物的部分氧化状态及其与载体材料的相互作用是催化剂性能的关键因素。
- CO2维持这种部分氧化状态的能力似乎是其促进作用的核心。

4. 催化系统的优化策略：
- 仔细选择能够实现CO2促进效应的载体材料。
- 调整活性金属氧化物的可还原性以保持部分氧化状态。
- 优化活性金属氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用。
- 考虑金属氧化物与载体颗粒之间的界面，以增强CO2的促进效应。

虽然这些发现特定于Cr2O3催化剂，但类似的原理可能适用于CO2-ODHP反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂。研究强调了仔细考虑载体材料的重要性，以及理解CO2存在下催化剂的氧化还原行为，以优化此类过程的催化系统。
