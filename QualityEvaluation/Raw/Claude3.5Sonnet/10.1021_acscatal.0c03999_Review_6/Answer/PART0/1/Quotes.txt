[1] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

[3] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."

[4] "Our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation between the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."

[5] "The type of support had a stronger influence on the catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as support showing extremely low ash content."

[6] "The alkaline metal oxide promoters lithium, potassium and sodium raised the activity of the catalyst Fe/D-90"

[7] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

[8] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."

[9] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14]"

[10] "The introduction of alkaline metal oxide promoters to iron oxide supported D-90 protected the catalyst partly against the loss of specific surface area"

[11] "No strong effects of the changes of pretreatment conditions on the catalytic performance were observed at 550C"

"Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

"Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion."

"Co-feeding CO2 substantially increased the activity for both catalysts and more CO was observed at high partial pressures of CO2. Both catalysts suffered from deactivation from coke formation. The addition of 25% O2 facilitated greater propane conversion, lower coke, and a greater syngas yield."

"Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8). The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts. 5% Ru doped CeO2 makes methane while 5% Ru doped ZrO2 produce no methane."

[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

"The effects of the Pd loading on the catalytic activity of Fe-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reaction were investigated."

"The specific activity of the catalysts decreased in the order of Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(15) > Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(10) > Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(20) > Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(05) > Fe2O3/HZSM-5"

"These results suggest that the catalytic performance of Fe-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reaction can be improved by the addition of Pd, and the optimal Pd loading is around 15 wt%."

"This can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Pd and Fe2O3, which enhances the reducibility of the catalysts and facilitates the activation of CO2 and propane."

"The conversion of CO2 is more closely related to the reducibility than the surface area of the catalysts."

"This may be attributed to that the active sites for CO2 activation are metallic Fe species reduced from iron oxide during reaction."

"The increase in CO2 conversion with increasing Ag-loading can be attributed to the formation of more active sites as a result of more reduction of iron oxide."

"The results reveal that the presence of Pt enhances the reducibility of the catalysts and improves the catalytic performance."

"These results suggest that the increase in reducibility with Pt-doping amount is related to the enhancement of catalytic activity and selectivity."

"The enhancement can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the catalysts, which facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies."

"The addition of Nb-doped to HZSM-5 with different Nb content was found to effectively improve the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP reaction."

"The catalytic activity and product selectivity increased with increasing Nb content up to 15 wt%, and then decreased slightly with further increase of Nb content."

"This can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility of the catalysts and the increased number of acid sites with appropriate strength."

"The improved catalytic performance of Nb-doped catalysts was also related to the formation of Nb-O-Si linkages, which helped to stabilize the active sites and prevent sintering during the reaction."

[1] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

[2] "In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions"

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "To account for the potential FeONi interfacial active sites based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface."

[5] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermodynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."

[1] "The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst."

[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

[4] "These ndings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[5] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."

[6] "The post-reactor XRD was performed. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed, but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in Cr2O3/SiO2."

[7] "TPR/D studies were carried out to elucidate the behavior of Cr2O3 in the catalyst during treatment with H2 and CO2."

[8] "The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed the diffraction lines ascribed only to the phases of respective supports. In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed."

[9] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[1] "CeO2 is a readily reducible oxide with the ability to reversibly convert between Ce4+ and Ce3+ and is well known for oxygen exchange properties that are critical for CO2 activation."

[2] "Effective CO2 adsorption on a ceria surface is structure dependent and the adsorption configurations dictate the mechanism and energetics of CO2 reduction. The adsorption process itself can weaken the C-O bond, but the vacancy geometry determines if CO2 would fill the vacancy."

[3] "Apart from CO2 filling vacancies or providing lattice oxygen, the exchange over CeO2 can also provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression."

[4] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[5] "CeO2 has the ability to accommodate high oxygen vacancy concentrations without a change in crystallographic structure even at high temperatures."

[6] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

[1] "The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding imporved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems."

[2] "It was confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization that all samples featured single cerianite crystalline phase with periodic lattice Ce ions substituted by Fe ions, with no hematite phase identified."

[3] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."

[4] "Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts."

[5] "Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2"

[6] "Recently, the effect of oxide supports was also investigated by the same research group highlighting the CeO2 as the most promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission."

[7] "Olefin selectivity was found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites."

[8] "DFT calculations suggested that Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined surface favors C-C cleavage."

[9] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant. The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites"

[1] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[2] "Comparing the H2-TPR profiles of bulk V2O5 and 0WV sample, shown in Fig. 2, the reduction profile for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks at 660 C and 790 C while for 0WV only one signal at 580 C can be observed."

[3] "The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form"

[4] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

[5] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[6] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."
