          [1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (AC) shows the best performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, attributed to its improved reducibility. The reduction process follows the pathway Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe.

In contrast, Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts exhibit reduced reducibility due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support. These interactions lead to the formation of hardly reducible phases (e.g., FeAl2O3 spinel) or strongly stabilized Fe2+ ions in the support matrix.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2. This highlights the crucial role of the redox cycle of Fe oxide in the CO2-ODHP process.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, these findings suggest:
1. Prioritizing support materials that enhance Fe oxide reducibility, such as activated carbon.
2. Avoiding supports that form strong interactions with Fe oxide or lead to hardly reducible phases.
3. Designing catalysts that facilitate efficient redox cycling of Fe oxide.
4. Balancing the reducibility of the catalyst with its ability to be reoxidized by CO2.

These insights can guide the development of more effective Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions by focusing on support materials and preparation methods that enhance reducibility while maintaining the ability to complete the redox cycle with CO2 as the oxidant.

          Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。以活性炭（AC）为载体的Fe2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6产率方面表现最佳，这归因于其改善的可还原性。还原过程遵循Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe的路径。

相比之下，以γ-Al2O3为载体的Fe2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂由于Fe氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而表现出较低的可还原性。这些相互作用导致了难以还原的相（如FeAl2O3尖晶石）的形成，或Fe2+离子在载体基质中被强烈稳定。

Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP的提议反应机理涉及两个主要步骤：（1）使用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6，（2）CO2对还原后的Fe氧化物进行再氧化。这突出了Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP过程中的关键作用。

为了优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统，这些发现表明：
1. 优先选择能增强Fe氧化物可还原性的载体材料，如活性炭。
2. 避免与Fe氧化物形成强相互作用或导致难还原相形成的载体。
3. 设计能促进Fe氧化物高效氧化还原循环的催化剂。
4. 平衡催化剂的可还原性与其被CO2再氧化的能力。

这些见解可以指导开发更有效的Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应，重点关注能提高可还原性的载体材料和制备方法，同时保持使用CO2作为氧化剂完成氧化还原循环的能力。
