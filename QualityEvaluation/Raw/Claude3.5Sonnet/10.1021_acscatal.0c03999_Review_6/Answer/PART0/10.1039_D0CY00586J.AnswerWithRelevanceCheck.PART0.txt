          [1] "The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding imporved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems."

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. CeO2 has been identified as the most promising support material due to its improved oxygen mobility, oxygen storage capacity (OSC), and ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. These properties contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites and overall catalyst stability.

The reaction mechanism involves competitive pathways such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), reverse water gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. These pathways can be tuned by carefully selecting the bimetallic composition of active sites. Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond breaking, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The Fe/Ce ratio plays a crucial role in determining catalyst behavior, with higher ratios enhancing the propane ODH pathway while suppressing propane cracking.

Deactivation mechanisms vary depending on Fe loading. Low Fe catalysts deactivate primarily due to coke deposition, while high Fe loading catalysts suffer from CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, researchers should focus on:
1. Using CeO2 as a support material to enhance CO2 activation and catalyst stability.
2. Tailoring the bimetallic composition and Fe loading to control the balance between different reaction pathways and minimize deactivation.
3. Leveraging the oxygen mobility and storage capacity of ceria-based catalysts to maintain stable active sites.
4. Considering the specific bond-breaking preferences of different metal combinations to optimize selectivity towards desired products.
5. Developing synthesis methods that ensure uniform Fe distribution within the CeO2 lattice to form single-phase Fe-Ce solid solutions.

These insights provide valuable information for designing more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

          Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。CeO2被确定为最有前景的载体材料，因为它具有改善的氧移动性、氧储存能力(OSC)，以及通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2的能力。这些特性有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点和整体催化剂稳定性。

反应机理涉及竞争性途径，如氧化脱氢(ODH)、逆水煤气反应和烷烃干重整。这些途径可以通过仔细选择活性位点的双金属组成来调节。Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt决定的表面有利于C-C键断裂。

Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂在使用CO2作为软氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出增强的稳定性和良好的催化性能。Fe/Ce比率在决定催化剂行为方面起着关键作用，较高的比率增强了丙烷ODH途径，同时抑制了丙烷裂解。

失活机理因Fe负载量而异。低Fe催化剂主要由于积碳而失活，而高Fe负载量催化剂则因CeO2烧结和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体而失活。

为了优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统，研究人员应该关注：
1. 使用CeO2作为载体材料来增强CO2活化和催化剂稳定性。
2. 调整双金属组成和Fe负载量，以控制不同反应途径之间的平衡并最小化失活。
3. 利用基于氧化铈的催化剂的氧移动性和储存能力来维持稳定的活性位点。
4. 考虑不同金属组合的特定键断裂偏好，以优化对目标产物的选择性。
5. 开发确保Fe在CeO2晶格中均匀分布的合成方法，以形成单相Fe-Ce固溶体。

这些见解为设计更高效、更具选择性的CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂提供了宝贵信息。
