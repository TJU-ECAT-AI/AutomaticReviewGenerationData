          "The effects of the Pd loading on the catalytic activity of Fe-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reaction were investigated."

"The specific activity of the catalysts decreased in the order of Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(15) > Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(10) > Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(20) > Fe2O3/Pd-HZSM-5(05) > Fe2O3/HZSM-5"

"These results suggest that the catalytic performance of Fe-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reaction can be improved by the addition of Pd, and the optimal Pd loading is around 15 wt%."

"This can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Pd and Fe2O3, which enhances the reducibility of the catalysts and facilitates the activation of CO2 and propane."

"The conversion of CO2 is more closely related to the reducibility than the surface area of the catalysts."

"This may be attributed to that the active sites for CO2 activation are metallic Fe species reduced from iron oxide during reaction."

"The increase in CO2 conversion with increasing Ag-loading can be attributed to the formation of more active sites as a result of more reduction of iron oxide."

"The results reveal that the presence of Pt enhances the reducibility of the catalysts and improves the catalytic performance."

"These results suggest that the increase in reducibility with Pt-doping amount is related to the enhancement of catalytic activity and selectivity."

"The enhancement can be attributed to the increased reducibility of the catalysts, which facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies."

"The addition of Nb-doped to HZSM-5 with different Nb content was found to effectively improve the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP reaction."

"The catalytic activity and product selectivity increased with increasing Nb content up to 15 wt%, and then decreased slightly with further increase of Nb content."

"This can be attributed to the enhanced reducibility of the catalysts and the increased number of acid sites with appropriate strength."

"The improved catalytic performance of Nb-doped catalysts was also related to the formation of Nb-O-Si linkages, which helped to stabilize the active sites and prevent sintering during the reaction."

          The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The addition of noble metals (Pd, Ag, Pt) and other elements (Nb) to Fe-based catalysts enhances their reducibility, which is closely related to improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The optimal loading of these additives (e.g., 15 wt% for Pd and Nb) results in the best catalytic performance.

The enhanced performance is attributed to several factors:
1. Synergistic effects between the additives and Fe2O3, facilitating the activation of CO2 and propane.
2. Formation of more active sites through increased reduction of iron oxide.
3. Generation of oxygen vacancies due to increased reducibility.
4. Stabilization of active sites and prevention of sintering (in the case of Nb-doped catalysts).

The reaction mechanism likely involves the reduction of iron oxide to form metallic Fe species, which serve as active sites for CO2 activation. The support material (e.g., HZSM-5) plays a crucial role in dispersing the active components and maintaining catalyst stability.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions, focus should be placed on:
1. Enhancing catalyst reducibility through careful selection of additives and support materials.
2. Balancing the loading of additives to achieve optimal performance.
3. Tailoring the support material composition to achieve an optimal balance of reducibility, acidity, and stability.
4. Incorporating promoters that facilitate the reduction process and stabilize active sites.

          Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。向Fe基催化剂中添加贵金属（Pd、Ag、Pt）和其他元素（Nb）可以增强其可还原性，这与催化活性和选择性的提高密切相关。这些添加剂的最佳负载量（例如Pd和Nb为15 wt%）可获得最佳催化性能。

性能提升归因于几个因素：
1. 添加剂与Fe2O3之间的协同效应，促进CO2和丙烷的活化。
2. 通过增加氧化铁的还原形成更多活性位点。
3. 由于可还原性增加而产生氧空位。
4. 稳定活性位点并防止烧结（对于Nb掺杂催化剂）。

反应机理可能涉及氧化铁还原形成金属Fe物种，这些物种作为CO2活化的活性位点。载体材料（如HZSM-5）在分散活性组分和维持催化剂稳定性方面起着关键作用。

为优化CO2-ODHP反应的催化系统，应重点关注：
1. 通过谨慎选择添加剂和载体材料来增强催化剂的可还原性。
2. 平衡添加剂的负载量以获得最佳性能。
3. 调整载体材料组成，以实现可还原性、酸度和稳定性的最佳平衡。
4. 引入促进还原过程和稳定活性位点的助剂。
