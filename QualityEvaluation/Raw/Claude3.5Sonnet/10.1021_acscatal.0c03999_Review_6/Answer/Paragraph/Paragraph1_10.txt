Fe oxide-based catalysts have shown promising potential in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) process, which offers a more sustainable route for propylene production. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the choice of support materials, which play a crucial role in determining the dispersion, reducibility, and stability of the active Fe species. Various supports, such as silica, alumina, and mixed metal oxides, have been investigated, each imparting unique properties to the catalyst system. The reducibility of Fe oxide species, often assessed through temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies, has been correlated with catalytic activity, as it affects the ability of the catalyst to participate in redox cycles during the reaction. The reaction mechanism involves complex interactions between the Fe active sites, the support, and the reactant molecules, with the support material influencing the adsorption and activation of CO2 and propane. Understanding the relationship between catalyst properties, such as surface area, pore structure, and Fe oxidation state, and the resulting catalytic activity is crucial for optimizing these systems. Recent research has focused on elucidating structure-activity relationships and developing novel support materials to enhance the selectivity and stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.
