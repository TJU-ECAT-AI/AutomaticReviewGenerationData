3.4. Other Transition Metal Catalysts
3.4.1. Fe-Based Catalysts
3.4.1.1. Fe2O3 Catalysts
Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2&ndash;ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane. (150−153) Michorczyk et al. have conducted screening tests on bare Fe2O3, supported Fe2O3 (active carbon (AC) and γ-Al2O3) catalysts, and hydrotalcite-derived Mg&ndash;Fe oxides. (154) Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived Fe&ndash;Mg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix. Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2&ndash;ODHP. Noteworthily, the absence of H2 from the reaction excludes the occurrence of RWGS. Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant.

Catalysts marked with an asterisk indicate that the sample was diluted to achieve comparable C3H8 reactant conversion to Fe3Ni.
dFe2O3/Ce2O3-phy represents a physical mixture with Fe2O3/CeO2 = 1/20 molar ratio. Other Fe&ndash;Ce solid solution catalysts are prepared by coprecipitation; values in the subscript indicate the molar percentage of Fe over Ce atoms.
ePd loading is 5 wt. % for all catalysts. The composition of CeZrOx is Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox. Data were collected at TOS = 1 h.
3.4.1.2. Fe&ndash;Ni Bimetallic Catalysts
To prepare cost-effective, selective, and coke-resistant catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP, Gomez et al. have conducted screening tests of monometallic and bimetallic transition metals and attempted to establish a library to determine the inherent activity toward either ODHP or DRP. (155) Transition metals that are active in ODHP and dry reforming, as well as efficient in coke resistance, were chosen, such as Fe, Ni/Co, and Pt/Pd. The FexNiy catalysts favor the CO2&ndash;ODHP path, and selectivity can be manipulated by varying the Ni content; others are active and selective for the DRP path (Table 7). The same group has continued to examine the competitive paths between CO2&ndash;ODHP and DRP at industrial operational conditions over these catalysts. (12) Monometallic catalysts exhibit low activity and selectivity toward C3H6 production (Table 7). The combination of Fe and Ni substantially improves both activity and selectivity, while combining Ni and Pt favors dry reforming products with much higher conversion of both reactants (Table 7). Clearly, there is a synergistic effect on Fe3Ni1 (i.e., C3H6 yield = 1.6%) in comparison to the simple sum of yields on the monometallic counterpart (e.g., 0.4% and 0.2% for Ni1 and Fe3, respectively). In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements (XANES and EXAFS) demonstrate that the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt and Ni with the formation of Pt&ndash;Ni bimetallic bonds, while the metallic Ni and oxidized Fe species present an inserted oxygen through Fe&ndash;O&ndash;Fe, as well as Fe&ndash;O bonds. Combined with DFT calculations, C&ndash;H bond scission is shown to be more thermodynamically favorable and kinetically feasible than C&ndash;C bond scission on the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface (Figure 11A), while Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) favors C&ndash;C bond scission (Figure 11B). Other identified interfacial active sites Fe&ndash;O&ndash;Ni show competitiveness in the first step of C&ndash;H and C&ndash;C bond scissions, whereas the following step of C&ndash;H scission is downhill in energy, while that of C&ndash;C scission is uphill in energy (Figure 11C). These results corroborate the crucial roles of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni in C3H6 production.

3.4.1.3. Fe&ndash;Ce Solid Solution Catalysts
Inspired by the well-recognized characteristics of CeO2 in improving oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity, Wang et al. report Fe-doped CeO2 solid solution catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP. (29) Among the catalysts with Fe/Ce ratios from 1 to 15%, both activity (C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield) and C3H6 selectivity are optimized at higher Fe/Ce ratios (Table 7). Deactivation as a consequence of coking occurs at low Fe/Ce ratios (i.e., <5%), while the FeCeO2 catalysts with higher Fe/Ce ratios (i.e., >5%) suffer from CeO2 crystal sintering and Fe migration to form nanosized crystals. Therefore, Fe5CeO2 has the optimal activity at Fe/Ce = 5 and exerts stable performance for more than 20 h on stream.
3.4.2. Mo-Based Catalysts: Mo2C
Supported Mo2C is reported to be active for methane conversion to benzene, in which Mo2C is crucial in activating the C&ndash;H bond of methane and subsequently forming CHx fragments on the surface. (156,157) Also, it is established as an effective catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. (158) On the basis of these findings, Solymosi et al. have prepared SiO2-supported Mo2C catalysts and evaluated their catalytic performance in CO2&ndash;ODHP. (159) At low temperatures (i.e., ≤ 500 °C), CO2 adsorption is too weak to dissociate on Mo2C, leading to poor activity at 500 °C, though a high C3H6 selectivity is attained (Table 7). At high temperatures (i.e., 670 °C), CO2 can oxidize Mo2C, resulting in enhanced activity, yet C3H6 selectivity is compromised because of the thermo-induced cracking to C2H4 (Table 7). Oxidation of Mo2C with CO2 is proposed as the initial step to activate the Mo2C surface, through which the Mo oxycarbide is formed with active oxygen to activate the methylene C&ndash;H bond in C3H8 molecules. (160)
3.4.3. Precious Metal Catalysts (Rh, Ru, Pt, and Pd)
An early work, led by Solymosi et al., shows that Al2O3-, SiO2-, TiO2-, and MgO-supported Rh catalysts have relatively low C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 50&ndash;60%) in the DHP reaction at 550&ndash;650 °C, along with the C3H8 conversion varying from ∼1 to 6%. (161) In the presence of CO2, the reaction pathway shifts from DHP to dry reforming of propylene on the Rh catalyst, resulting in the dominance of CO and H2 with decreased C3H6 selectivity. Similar results are also evident on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (162) and supported Au catalysts. (163) CO and H2 become the major products in the case of Ru/CeO2 and Ru/ZrO2, regardless of the reducibility of these support materials. (164) Precious and noble metals are active in C&ndash;C cleavage and the dry reforming reaction, which make them less suitable for catalyzing CO2&ndash;ODHP as a single active component. An option to use precious metals is to make them an assistant component responsible for the regeneration of active sites.
Ceria proves to be an effective catalyst for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, and the high activity is linked with its oxygen storage/release capacity (OSC) in terms of creation and replenishment of oxygen vacancies. (165−168) Adding ZrO2 into CeO2 endows the formed bimetallic oxides with more stabilized oxygen vacancies; moreover, CO2 dissociation can occur on CeZrOx and lead to a highly oxidized state of Ce. (169) To improve the durability of such oxide combination, Al2O3 is used as the underlying support. (170) Inspired by the functionalities of these components in mixed oxide catalysts, Nowicka et al. have prepared Pd catalysts supported on CeZrAlOx mixed oxides with various compositions and evaluated their activity in CO2&ndash;ODHP. (171) Screening tests clarify that the optimal composition and Pd loading are obtained on Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox-supported Pd catalyst (Table 7); Pd/Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox also displays long-term stability of C3H8 conversion from 40 to 140 h on stream, along with a slight rise of C3H6 selectivity from ∼94% to 98%. As proposed in Figure 12, reactions on Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox proceed through a combined Mars van Krevelen (MvK) and RWGS mechanism linked by a common step. The lattice oxygen ions abstract H from C3H8 to form C3H6 and H2O. CO2 takes part in the replenishment of the consumed O species in both Ce0.25Zr0.25Al0.5Ox and Pd sites, releasing CO as a byproduct. Of note, Pd only promotes the oxidation activity of the redox sites Ce3+ ↔ Ce4+ in the catalyst rather than the secondary reaction, such as dry reforming of propylene. Therefore, its presence boosts overall C3H8 conversion without sacrificing C3H6 selectivity.


3.5. Roles of CO2 in CO2&ndash;ODHP
Early work has considered co-fed CO2 merely as a diluent and heating medium, yet continuing studies unravel its other important roles. (57) Liu et al. have conducted DFT studies of CO2&ndash;ODHP over Ga2O3(100) surface and suggested that C3H6 forms via DHP in CO2&ndash;ODHP. (172) Positive roles of CO2 include (i) reoxidizing the reduced catalyst surface, (ii) shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side of CO2&ndash;ODHP by consuming the produced H2 via RWGS, and (iii) removing surface deposited carbon via reverse Boudouard reaction. These positive effects are generally applicable to all catalysts that have been developed but vary depending on the redox properties of the active metal oxides and the nature of the support. Negative impacts also exist, which are mainly reflected in the competitive CO2 adsorption against C3H8.
3.5.1. Oxidation State and Redox Cycle
Redox-active metal oxides can be reduced upon the contact with C3H8. In comparison to the direct DHP reaction, a donation of oxygen species in CO2 can help to maintain Cr at high oxidation states. (173,174) Despite the weak oxidizing potential, CO2 can take part in the reoxidation of CrOx to complete the redox cycle, benefiting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6. This positive role in the case of CrOx has already been discussed in section 3.1. Similarly, adding CO2 can change the redox properties of the V-based catalysts, such as the oxidation states. Takahara et al. report that using CO2 as an oxidant results in the presence of V5+ rather than V4+/V3+ in the direct DHP reaction. (175) In DHP, the V&ndash;OH sites adjacent to V4+/V3+ are proposed as acid sites on VOx, which are detrimental to C3H6 yield by boosting the reaction of propylene to aromatics. (176) CO2 addition reduces the number of acid sites by changing the oxidation state to V5+, leading to a higher propylene yield by inhibiting aromatization.
3.5.2. CO2-Promoting Effects in Shifting Reaction Equilibrium of CO2&ndash;ODHP
Isotope-labeling experiments have been conducted by introducing D2 in the feed with C3H8 and CO2, and revealed only 45% of the formed water contains D2O. (28) This observation confirms the existence of parallel-consecutive reaction networks consisting of ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. Figure 13 shows changes in the C3H6 formation rate during switch-operation mode between DHP and CO2−ODHP on CrSiBeta and CrAlBeta catalysts. (22) Clearly, the CO2-promoting effect on C3H6 formation is only evident on the CrSiBeta catalyst, as evidenced from the alternatingly highest C3H6 and H2 formation rates in CO2&ndash;ODHP (Figure 13A). This indicates that the H2 formed through the DHP is consumed by reacting with CO2, which shifts the reaction equilibrium of the ODHP to the product side with a higher C3H6 formation rate. This CO2-promoting effect is also valid on other catalysts, such as Cr/HZSM-5 (141,143) and Cr-SBA-1, (66) and Ga2O3 catalysts, (121,129) regardless of redox properties.

It is noteworthy that the CO2-promoting effect is not universal and is affected by the nature of the support, such as CrAlBeta in Figure 13B. Combined with the low Si/Al ratio in this catalyst, the stronger acidity might interfere in the CO2-promoting effect by shifting the reaction pathways. (22) Among Al2O3-, activated carbon (AC)-, and SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP, Takahara et al. observe that the CO2-promoting effect is only evident on Cr2O3/SiO2. (74,75) The correlation between CO/H2 ratio and C3H6 yield demonstrates that DHP and RWGS occur in the case of Cr2O3/Al2O3, while the combination of DHP and DRP occurs on Cr2O3/SiO2.
3.5.3. Agent for Coke Removal
The reverse Boudouard reaction is an endothermic reaction, which likely happens in the temperature range that has been explored (i.e., 500&ndash;650 °C) for CO2&ndash;ODHP. Pulse experiments have confirmed that little coke forms in the presence of CO2 on bulk Ga2O3 catalysts, and CO2 can serve as an agent to remove deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction. (23) A similar effect on coke removal has also been observed on other catalyst systems, including Cr2O3/SiO2, (74,75) Cr/HZSM-5, (141,143) and Cr-MCM-41. (173,174) Of note, CO2 cannot completely prevent deactivation or completely eliminate coke, but it can help to alleviate coke formation.
COx-derived coke may form through two conditions on Cr sites: (i) CO2 fixation caused by reduced Cr species with abundant H species at the surface and (ii) carbon chain growth and aromatization reaction triggered at high temperatures (i.e., >300 °C). (73) The presence of CO2 consumes the surface atomic H species, the concentration of which becomes too low to deoxygenate C&ndash;O species to form hydrocarbon species through C&ndash;C coupling chain growth or aromatization. Clearly, not only can CO2 contribute to the coke removal, but it can also inhibit coking, benefiting the overall stability of Cr catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP.
3.5.4. Competitive Adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6
A negative role of CO2 has also been reported on redox CrOx catalysts, in which the presence of CO2 in the feed gas hampers the adsorption of C3H8. (24) On the other hand, it prevents the adsorption of C3H6 and its subsequent conversion into coke. (24) Therefore, an overall CO2-promoting effect still predominates in the case of CrOx. On HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalysts with a non-redox property, the reaction proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation mechanism, in which C3H8 dissociates on acid&ndash;base pairs in the forms of H&ndash; and C3H7+, respectively (Figure 10A). (127) As a more acidic molecule than C3H8, CO2 adsorption on basic sites will negatively impact C3H8 adsorption on Ga2O3, causing drop in activity. In particular, the negative impact prevails at higher CO2 partial pressures. Hence, a proper C3H8/CO2 ratio is of importance for high dehydrogenation activity in CO2&ndash;ODHP. This is the area where more efforts are needed in future studies.

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) reactions. Key findings from the literature review include:

1. Support Material:
Active carbon, particularly low-ash content varieties like D-90, has been found to be the most effective support for Fe oxide catalysts [10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7]. CeO2 is also identified as a promising support due to its oxygen storage/release capability, which facilitates CO2 activation and suppresses coke formation [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The choice of support material can significantly impact catalyst performance, with SiO2-supported catalysts showing unique benefits from CO2 promotion in some cases [10.1016/S0920-5861(98)00245-4].

2. Reducibility:
The reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (AC) exhibits improved reducibility, following the pathway Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6]. However, the reducibility can be retarded when Fe2O3 is supported on γ-Al2O3 or in hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts due to strong interactions with the support [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6].

3. Active Phase and Oxidation State:
The formation of potassium ferrite on the catalyst surface is proposed as the active phase for some Fe oxide catalysts [10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7]. In situ XANES measurements revealed that Fe in Fe3Ni catalysts remained in an oxidized state under reaction conditions, while Ni was in a metallic form [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This oxidized state of Fe appears to be crucial for promoting selective formation of propylene.

4. Promoters and Additives:
The addition of alkali metal oxides (Li, Na, K) significantly enhances catalyst activity, with an optimal alkali metal to Fe atomic ratio of 0.1 [10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00514-7]. Noble metals (Pd, Ag, Pt) and other elements (Nb) added to Fe-based catalysts enhance their reducibility, which is closely related to improved catalytic activity and selectivity [10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x].

5. Reaction Mechanism:
The proposed reaction mechanism involves two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_6]. The presence of CO2 can also increase propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

6. Catalyst Stability and Deactivation:
Deactivation mechanisms vary depending on Fe loading. Low Fe catalysts deactivate primarily due to coke deposition, while high Fe loading catalysts suffer from support sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP reactions, researchers should focus on:
1. Using support materials that enhance Fe oxide reducibility and CO2 activation, such as activated carbon or CeO2.
2. Maintaining an optimal iron content (around 5 wt%) and incorporating appropriate promoters.
3. Controlling the oxidation state of Fe to maintain it in a partially oxidized form during the reaction.
4. Tailoring the surface structure and bimetallic composition to optimize CO2 adsorption and subsequent reaction steps.
5. Enhancing catalyst stability by minimizing coke formation and preventing sintering.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The complex interplay between Fe oxide, support materials, and promoters in CO2-ODHP reactions presents both challenges and opportunities for catalyst design. Future research directions could include:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state under reaction conditions.
2. Development of novel support materials or composite supports that combine the beneficial properties of multiple materials (e.g., CeO2-AC composites).
3. Exploration of advanced synthesis methods to create highly dispersed and stable Fe oxide species on supports.
4. Investigation of the role of defects and interfaces in CO2 activation and propane dehydrogenation.
5. Computational studies to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures for enhanced performance.
6. Integration of machine learning approaches to accelerate catalyst discovery and optimization.
7. Exploration of sustainable and economically viable alternatives to noble metal promoters.
8. Scale-up studies to address challenges in translating lab-scale results to industrial applications.

By addressing these areas, researchers can work towards developing more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, potentially enabling more sustainable routes for propylene production.
