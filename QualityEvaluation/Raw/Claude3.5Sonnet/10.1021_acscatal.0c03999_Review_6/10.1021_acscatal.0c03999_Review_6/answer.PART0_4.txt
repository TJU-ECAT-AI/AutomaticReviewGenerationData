[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (AC) shows the best performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, while maintaining comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. This is attributed to the improved reducibility of Fe2O3/AC, which undergoes a stepwise reduction process (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe).

In contrast, Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts exhibit reduced reducibility due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support. For instance, Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 forms a spinel phase FeAl2O3 that is difficult to reduce, while Fe3+ cations in MgO-supported catalysts are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix.

These observations provide insights into the proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts. The reaction is thought to proceed through two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in this process.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, these findings suggest that:

1. Support materials that enhance the reducibility of Fe oxide, such as activated carbon, are preferable.
2. Avoiding supports that form strong interactions with Fe oxide or lead to the formation of hardly reducible phases is important.
3. Maintaining an efficient redox cycle of Fe oxide is crucial for high catalytic performance.
4. Balancing the reducibility of the catalyst with its ability to be reoxidized by CO2 is key to sustaining the catalytic cycle.

These insights can guide the design of more effective Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions by focusing on support materials and preparation methods that enhance reducibility while maintaining the ability to complete the redox cycle with CO2 as the oxidant.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。负载在活性炭（AC）上的Fe2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现最佳，同时保持与纯Fe2O3相当的C3H6选择性。这归因于Fe2O3/AC的可还原性提高，它经历了阶段性还原过程（Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe）。

相比之下，负载在γ-Al2O3上的Fe2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂由于Fe氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而表现出降低的可还原性。例如，γ-Al2O3上的Fe2O3形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3，而MgO负载催化剂中的Fe3+阳离子还原为Fe2+离子，在MgO基质中被强烈稳定。

这些观察为Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP的反应机理提供了见解。该反应被认为通过两个主要步骤进行：(1)使用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6，(2)被还原的Fe氧化物被CO2重新氧化。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在这个过程中起着关键作用。

为了优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统，这些发现表明：

1. 优先选择能提高Fe氧化物可还原性的载体材料，如活性炭。
2. 避免使用与Fe氧化物形成强相互作用或导致难还原相形成的载体很重要。
3. 保持Fe氧化物的高效氧化还原循环对高催化性能至关重要。
4. 平衡催化剂的可还原性与其被CO2重新氧化的能力是维持催化循环的关键。

这些见解可以指导设计更有效的Fe氧化物基CO2-ODHP反应催化剂，重点关注能提高可还原性的载体材料和制备方法，同时保持使用CO2作为氧化剂完成氧化还原循环的能力。
