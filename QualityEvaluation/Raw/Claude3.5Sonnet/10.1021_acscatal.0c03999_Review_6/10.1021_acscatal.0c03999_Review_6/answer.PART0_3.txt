[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon) shows superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield compared to other supports. This is attributed to its improved reducibility, with the reduction process following the pathway Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe.

In contrast, Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts exhibit reduced reducibility due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support. For instance, Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 forms a spinel phase FeAl2O3 that is difficult to reduce, while in MgO-based supports, Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix.

These findings provide insights into the proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts. The reaction is thought to proceed through two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2. This suggests that the redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP process.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, these insights indicate that:

1. Support materials that enhance the reducibility of Fe oxide, such as activated carbon, are preferable.
2. Supports that form strong interactions with Fe oxide, potentially hindering its reducibility, should be avoided.
3. The catalyst design should facilitate the redox cycle of Fe oxide, allowing for efficient oxidation of C3H8 and subsequent reoxidation by CO2.
4. The ability of the catalyst to maintain an appropriate balance between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 species may be crucial for optimal performance.

These considerations can guide future research in developing more effective Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。Fe2O3/AC（活性炭）在C3H8转化和C3H6产率方面表现优于其他载体。这归因于其改善的可还原性，还原过程遵循Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe的路径。

相比之下，负载在γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生FeMg催化剂上的Fe2O3由于Fe氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而表现出降低的可还原性。例如，γ-Al2O3上的Fe2O3形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3，而在基于MgO的载体中，Fe3+阳离子被还原为在MgO基质中被强烈稳定的Fe2+离子。

这些发现为Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP的反应机理提供了见解。该反应被认为通过两个主要步骤进行：(1)使用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6，(2)CO2对还原的Fe氧化物进行再氧化。这表明Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP过程中起着关键作用。

为优化此过程的催化系统，这些见解表明：

1. 优先选择能增强Fe氧化物可还原性的载体材料，如活性炭。
2. 应避免与Fe氧化物形成强相互作用、可能阻碍其可还原性的载体。
3. 催化剂设计应促进Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，允许C3H8的高效氧化和随后的CO2再氧化。
4. 催化剂保持Fe2O3和Fe3O4物种之间适当平衡的能力可能对最佳性能至关重要。

这些考虑可以指导未来研究开发更有效的Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应。
