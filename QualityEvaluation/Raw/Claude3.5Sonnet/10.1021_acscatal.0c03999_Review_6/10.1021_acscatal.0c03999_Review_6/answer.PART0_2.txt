[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (AC) shows superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield compared to other supports. This is attributed to the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC, which allows for a more efficient redox cycle.

In contrast, Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts exhibit retarded reducibility due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support. For instance, Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 forms a spinel phase FeAl2O3 that is difficult to reduce, while Fe3+ cations in MgO-supported catalysts are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix.

These observations provide insights into the proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts. The reaction is thought to proceed through two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2 acting as a soft oxidant. This mechanism highlights the crucial role of the redox cycle of Fe oxide in the CO2-ODHP process.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, these findings suggest that support materials that enhance the reducibility of Fe oxide without forming stable, hard-to-reduce phases should be prioritized. Activated carbon appears to be a promising support in this regard. Additionally, the ability of the catalyst to maintain an efficient redox cycle is key to achieving high performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。以活性炭（AC）为载体的Fe2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6产率方面表现优于其他载体。这归因于Fe2O3在AC上的可还原性得到改善，从而使氧化还原循环更加高效。

相比之下，以γ-Al2O3为载体的Fe2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂由于Fe氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而表现出较低的可还原性。例如，Fe2O3在γ-Al2O3上形成难以还原的尖晶石相FeAl2O3，而在MgO支持的催化剂中，Fe3+阳离子被还原为在MgO基质中被强烈稳定的Fe2+离子。

这些观察结果为Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP的反应机理提供了见解。该反应被认为通过两个主要步骤进行：（1）使用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6，（2）CO2作为软氧化剂重新氧化还原后的Fe氧化物。这一机理突出了Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP过程中的关键作用。

为了优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统，这些发现表明应优先选择能够增强Fe氧化物可还原性而不形成稳定、难以还原相的载体材料。活性炭在这方面显示出promising的特性。此外，催化剂保持高效氧化还原循环的能力是实现CO2-ODHP反应高性能的关键。
