[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "However, the reducibility of Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts is retarded due to the strong interaction between Fe oxide with support. For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The reducibility and support materials of Fe oxide-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (AC) shows the best performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, while maintaining comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. This is attributed to the improved reducibility of Fe2O3/AC, which undergoes a stepwise reduction process (Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe).

In contrast, Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts exhibit reduced reducibility due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support. For instance, Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 forms a spinel phase (FeAl2O3) that is difficult to reduce, while Fe3+ cations in MgO-supported catalysts are reduced to Fe2+ ions that are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix.

These observations provide insights into the proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts. The reaction is thought to proceed through two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2. This mechanism highlights the crucial role of the redox cycle of Fe oxide in the CO2-ODHP process.

To optimize catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP, these findings suggest that:

1. Support materials should be chosen to enhance the reducibility of Fe oxide, with activated carbon being a promising option.
2. The redox properties of the catalyst should be carefully tuned to facilitate both the reduction and reoxidation steps of the proposed mechanism.
3. Strong interactions between the Fe oxide and support material should be avoided, as they can hinder the catalyst's reducibility and overall performance.

By considering these factors, researchers can design more efficient Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved propylene yields and selectivity.

Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。负载在活性炭（AC）上的Fe2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现最佳，同时保持与纯Fe2O3相当的C3H6选择性。这归因于Fe2O3/AC的可还原性得到改善，经历了逐步还原过程（Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe）。

相比之下，负载在γ-Al2O3上的Fe2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂由于Fe氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而表现出降低的可还原性。例如，Fe2O3在γ-Al2O3上形成难以还原的尖晶石相（FeAl2O3），而在MgO支持的催化剂中，Fe3+阳离子被还原为Fe2+离子，并在MgO基质中被强烈稳定。

这些观察结果为Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP的反应机理提供了见解。该反应被认为通过两个主要步骤进行：（1）使用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6，（2）CO2对还原后的Fe氧化物进行再氧化。这一机理突出了Fe氧化物氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP过程中的关键作用。

为了优化CO2-ODHP的催化系统，这些发现表明：

1. 应选择能够增强Fe氧化物可还原性的载体材料，活性炭是一个有前途的选择。
2. 应仔细调节催化剂的氧化还原性能，以促进所提出机理中的还原和再氧化步骤。
3. 应避免Fe氧化物与载体材料之间的强相互作用，因为它们可能会阻碍催化剂的可还原性和整体性能。

通过考虑这些因素，研究人员可以设计出更高效的Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应，有可能提高丙烯产率和选择性。
