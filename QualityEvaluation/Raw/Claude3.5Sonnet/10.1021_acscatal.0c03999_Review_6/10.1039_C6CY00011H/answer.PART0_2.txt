[1] "Ceria and zirconia are relatively inactive for reactions with alkanes. Atomic doping with 5% Ru activates both metal oxides for partial oxidation of propane with carbon dioxide as an oxidant."

[2] "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C."

[3] "We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

[4] "Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion."

The literature does not specifically discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights on how reducibility and support materials affect catalyst performance for propane partial oxidation with CO2:

1. Ruthenium doping activates both ceria and zirconia for this reaction, despite their inactivity when undoped.

2. While Ru-doped ceria showed higher reducibility than Ru-doped zirconia, both catalysts had similar activities above 300°C. The reducibility of the oxide support did not significantly affect catalyst activity.

3. The ruthenium metal loading had the largest effect on propane conversion, more so than the choice of oxide support.

These findings suggest that for this reaction, the active metal (Ru) plays a more crucial role than the reducibility or type of oxide support. This provides insight into optimizing catalytic systems, indicating that focus should be on the active metal rather than support properties. However, caution should be taken in directly applying these insights to Fe oxide catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions without further specific studies.

该文献并未具体讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而，它确实提供了一些关于还原性和支撑材料如何影响丙烷与CO2部分氧化反应的催化剂性能的见解：

1. 钌掺杂能够激活氧化铈和氧化锆进行这种反应，尽管它们在未掺杂时是不活跃的。

2. 虽然钌掺杂的氧化铈表现出比钌掺杂的氧化锆更高的还原性，但两种催化剂在300°C以上的活性相似。氧化物支撑体的还原性对催化剂活性没有显著影响。

3. 钌金属的负载量对丙烷转化率的影响最大，比氧化物支撑体的选择更为重要。

这些发现表明，对于这种反应，活性金属（钌）比氧化物支撑体的还原性或类型起着更关键的作用。这为优化催化系统提供了见解，表明应该关注活性金属而不是支撑体的性质。然而，在没有进行进一步具体研究的情况下，应谨慎地将这些见解直接应用于Fe氧化物催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。
