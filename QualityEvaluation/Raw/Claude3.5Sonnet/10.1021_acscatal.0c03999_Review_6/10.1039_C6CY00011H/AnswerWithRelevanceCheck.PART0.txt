          "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

"Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion."

"Co-feeding CO2 substantially increased the activity for both catalysts and more CO was observed at high partial pressures of CO2. Both catalysts suffered from deactivation from coke formation. The addition of 25% O2 facilitated greater propane conversion, lower coke, and a greater syngas yield."

"Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8). The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts. 5% Ru doped CeO2 makes methane while 5% Ru doped ZrO2 produce no methane."

          While the provided literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, it offers insights into the influence of reducibility and support materials on Ru-doped catalysts for propane partial oxidation with CO2. These findings may provide some relevant principles for understanding CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Reducibility: The reducibility of the oxide support (ceria vs. zirconia) did not significantly affect catalyst activity for propane conversion, despite ceria being more reducible. This suggests that the redox properties of the support may not be the primary factor in determining catalyst performance for this reaction.

2. Metal loading: The ruthenium metal loading had the largest effect on propane conversion, indicating that the active metal plays a more crucial role than the support material in this reaction.

3. CO2 activation: The presence of CO2 as an oxidant significantly increased catalyst activity, suggesting that CO2 activation is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

4. Oxygen addition: The addition of O2 improved propane conversion and reduced coke formation, indicating that oxygen can play a beneficial role in the reaction and catalyst stability.

5. Product distribution: The support material influenced product selectivity, with Ru-doped CeO2 producing some methane while Ru-doped ZrO2 did not.

These insights suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions with Fe oxide-based catalysts:
- The reducibility of the support may not be the most critical factor
- The active metal (Fe in this case) loading and dispersion could be more important
- CO2 activation is likely a crucial step in the mechanism
- Co-feeding O2 might improve performance and stability
- The choice of support material may influence product selectivity

However, it's important to note that these conclusions are drawn from a study on Ru-based catalysts and may not directly apply to Fe oxide-based systems. Further research specific to Fe oxide catalysts would be needed to confirm these hypotheses for CO2-ODHP reactions and to optimize the catalytic systems for this process.

          虽然所提供的文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用，但它提供了关于可还原性和载体材料对Ru掺杂催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷部分氧化反应中影响的见解。这些发现可能为理解CO2-ODHP反应提供一些相关原则：

1. 可还原性：尽管氧化铈更易还原，但氧化物载体（氧化铈与氧化锆）的可还原性并未显著影响催化剂对丙烷转化的活性。这表明载体的氧化还原性能可能不是决定此反应催化剂性能的主要因素。

2. 金属负载量：钌金属负载量对丙烷转化影响最大，表明在这种反应中，活性金属比载体材料起着更关键的作用。

3. CO2活化：CO2作为氧化剂的存在显著提高了催化剂活性，表明CO2的活化是反应机理中的关键步骤。

4. 氧气添加：添加O2改善了丙烷转化率并减少了积碳形成，表明氧气可以在反应和催化剂稳定性方面发挥有益作用。

5. 产物分布：载体材料影响产物选择性，Ru掺杂CeO2产生少量甲烷，而Ru掺杂ZrO2则不产生甲烷。

这些见解表明，对于Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP反应：
- 载体的可还原性可能不是最关键的因素
- 活性金属（在这种情况下为Fe）的负载量和分散度可能更为重要
- CO2的活化可能是机理中的关键步骤
- 共进料O2可能会提高性能和稳定性
- 载体材料的选择可能会影响产物选择性

然而，需要注意的是，这些结论是从Ru基催化剂的研究中得出的，可能不能直接应用于Fe氧化物基系统。需要对Fe氧化物催化剂进行进一步的专门研究，以确认这些假设在CO2-ODHP反应中的适用性，并优化该过程的催化系统。
