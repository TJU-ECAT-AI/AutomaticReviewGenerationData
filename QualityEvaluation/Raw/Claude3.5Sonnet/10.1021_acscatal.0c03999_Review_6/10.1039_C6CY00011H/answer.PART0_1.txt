[1] "On both the reducible Ru doped ceria and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C."

[2] "Ceria is redox active metal oxide which when partially reduced contains abundant vacancies making the surface relatively basic and reactive to CO2 (a Lewis acid) forming carbonate intermediates. Whereas, zirconia is a less reducible oxide generally considered to be an acidic metal oxide and not as reactive for acidic CO2."

[3] "The O2 consumption obtained for 5% Ru doped CeO2 catalyst was considerably higher than 5% Ru doped ZrO2. Several studies reported that cerium oxide have a very high oxygen storage capacity."

[4] "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

The reducibility and support materials of Ru-doped oxide catalysts showed some influence on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but not as much as might be expected. 

Ceria is a reducible, redox-active oxide with high oxygen storage capacity, while zirconia is less reducible and more acidic. Ru-doped ceria showed higher oxygen mobility and reducibility compared to Ru-doped zirconia. 

However, despite these differences in reducibility and support properties, both catalysts showed comparable activity for propane partial oxidation below 450°C, producing mainly CO and H2. Both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300°C, and their activities were nearly identical above 300°C.

This suggests that the reducibility of the oxide support had no significant effect on the catalyst activity for this reaction. The ruthenium metal loading appears to be the dominant factor influencing propane conversion, rather than the properties of the support oxide.

These findings provide insight that the reaction mechanism may not heavily depend on the redox properties or oxygen mobility of the support material. Instead, the active sites created by ruthenium doping seem to be the key factor. This suggests that optimizing the ruthenium loading and dispersion may be more important for improving catalytic performance than engineering the reducibility of the support oxide.

Ru掺杂氧化物催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应性能确实有一些影响,但影响程度并不如预期的那么大。

氧化铈是一种可还原的、具有氧化还原活性的氧化物,具有高氧储存能力,而氧化锆则不易还原且更具酸性。Ru掺杂的氧化铈表现出比Ru掺杂的氧化锆更高的氧移动性和可还原性。

然而,尽管在可还原性和载体特性方面存在这些差异,但两种催化剂在450°C以下的丙烷部分氧化活性相当,主要产物为CO和H2。两种催化剂在300°C以下对丙烷都没有反应活性,而在300°C以上它们的活性几乎相同。

这表明氧化物载体的可还原性对该反应的催化活性没有显著影响。钌金属的负载量似乎是影响丙烷转化的主要因素,而不是载体氧化物的性质。

这些发现提供了一个见解,即反应机理可能并不heavily依赖于载体材料的氧化还原性质或氧移动性。相反,钌掺杂产生的活性位点似乎是关键因素。这表明,优化钌的负载量和分散度可能比改进载体氧化物的可还原性更重要,以提高催化性能。
