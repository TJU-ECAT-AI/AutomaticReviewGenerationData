[1] "For the H2-TPR of Ru doped CeO2, the H2 partial pressure starts decreasing as the temperature reached to 100 C, and at the same time water signal observed in the mass spectrometer. The maximum amount of hydrogen consumed at 150 C, and this correlates the maximum amount of water produced at the same temperature confirmed from the change in partial pressure of H2 and H2O and the overall H2 uptake was 535 μmol g1."

[2] "In case of Ru doped ZrO2, the H2 uptake starts at around 200 C and the maximum H2 reduction occur at much higher temperature 350 C compare to Ru doped CeO2 catalyst. The H2 uptake calculation shows very low amount of H2 was consumed (137 μmol g1), considering ZrO2 is hardly reducible oxide (34 μmol g1)."

[3] "Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8). The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts. 5% Ru doped CeO2 makes methane while 5% Ru doped ZrO2 produce no methane."

The study does not directly examine Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, but instead focuses on Ru-doped CeO2 and ZrO2 catalysts for propane partial oxidation with CO2. However, some insights can be drawn from the results:

1. The reducibility of the support material significantly affects catalyst performance. Ru-doped CeO2 was more easily reduced and showed higher H2 uptake compared to Ru-doped ZrO2.

2. The more reducible Ru-doped CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher catalytic activity (53% conversion) compared to the less reducible Ru-doped ZrO2 (22% conversion) under oxidative conditions.

3. Both catalysts produced mainly CO and H2, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism involving C-C bond cleavage and reforming rather than dehydrogenation.

4. The support material influenced product selectivity, with Ru-doped CeO2 producing some methane while Ru-doped ZrO2 did not.

These findings suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions, using a more reducible support material could potentially enhance catalytic activity. However, it may also affect product selectivity. Optimizing the balance between reducibility and desired product selectivity would be crucial for developing effective catalysts for this process.

这项研究并没有直接研究Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现,而是专注于Ru掺杂CeO2和ZrO2催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷部分氧化反应。然而,从结果中可以得出一些见解:

1. 载体材料的可还原性显著影响催化剂性能。Ru掺杂CeO2更容易被还原,并且显示出比Ru掺杂ZrO2更高的H2吸收量。

2. 在氧化条件下,可还原性更强的Ru掺杂CeO2催化剂表现出更高的催化活性(53%转化率),而可还原性较弱的Ru掺杂ZrO2的转化率为22%。

3. 两种催化剂主要产生CO和H2,这表明反应机理可能涉及C-C键断裂和重整,而非脱氢。

4. 载体材料影响产物选择性,Ru掺杂CeO2产生少量甲烷,而Ru掺杂ZrO2则不产生甲烷。

这些发现表明,对于CO2-ODHP反应,使用更易还原的载体材料可能会增强催化活性。然而,它也可能影响产物选择性。优化可还原性和所需产物选择性之间的平衡对于开发这一过程的有效催化剂至关重要。
