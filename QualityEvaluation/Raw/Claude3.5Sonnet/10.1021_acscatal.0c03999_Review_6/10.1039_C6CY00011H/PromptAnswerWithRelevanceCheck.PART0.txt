[1] "For the H2-TPR of Ru doped CeO2, the H2 partial pressure starts decreasing as the temperature reached to 100 C, and at the same time water signal observed in the mass spectrometer. The maximum amount of hydrogen consumed at 150 C, and this correlates the maximum amount of water produced at the same temperature confirmed from the change in partial pressure of H2 and H2O and the overall H2 uptake was 535 μmol g1."

[2] "In case of Ru doped ZrO2, the H2 uptake starts at around 200 C and the maximum H2 reduction occur at much higher temperature 350 C compare to Ru doped CeO2 catalyst. The H2 uptake calculation shows very low amount of H2 was consumed (137 μmol g1), considering ZrO2 is hardly reducible oxide (34 μmol g1)."

[3] "Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8). The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts. 5% Ru doped CeO2 makes methane while 5% Ru doped ZrO2 produce no methane."

The question cannot be directly answered based on the given literature, as it specifically asks about Fe oxide-based catalysts and CO2-ODHP reactions, which are not discussed in the provided text. However, we can draw some insights from the comparison of Ru-doped CeO2 and ZrO2 catalysts in propane partial oxidation with CO2.

The literature shows that the reducibility of the support material significantly influences catalyst performance. Ru-doped CeO2 is more easily reducible than Ru-doped ZrO2, as evidenced by lower reduction temperatures and higher H2 uptake. This higher reducibility correlates with better catalytic performance in propane partial oxidation, with Ru-doped CeO2 showing higher conversion (53%) compared to Ru-doped ZrO2 (22%).

The difference in reducibility affects product distribution as well. While both catalysts primarily produce CO and H2, only Ru-doped CeO2 produces methane, likely due to its higher reducibility and oxygen mobility.

These findings suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions with Fe oxide-based catalysts, using a more reducible support material might lead to higher catalytic activity and potentially different product distributions. The ease of reduction could facilitate oxygen mobility and the creation of active sites, which are crucial for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

However, it's important to note that the reaction mechanisms for propane partial oxidation and CO2-ODHP may differ, so direct extrapolation of these results to Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions should be done cautiously. Further studies specifically on Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed to confirm these hypotheses and optimize the catalytic systems for this process.

虽然给定的文献没有直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂和CO2-ODHP反应，因此无法直接回答这个问题，但我们可以从Ru掺杂CeO2和ZrO2催化剂在丙烷部分氧化与CO2反应中的比较中得到一些见解。

文献表明，支撑材料的可还原性显著影响催化剂性能。Ru掺杂CeO2比Ru掺杂ZrO2更容易还原，这从较低的还原温度和较高的H2吸收量可以看出。这种较高的可还原性与丙烷部分氧化中更好的催化性能相关，Ru掺杂CeO2显示出更高的转化率（53%），而Ru掺杂ZrO2的转化率为22%。

可还原性的差异也影响产品分布。虽然两种催化剂主要产生CO和H2，但只有Ru掺杂CeO2产生甲烷，这可能是由于其较高的可还原性和氧移动性。

这些发现表明，对于Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP反应，使用更易还原的支撑材料可能会导致更高的催化活性和潜在的不同产品分布。还原的容易程度可能有助于氧的移动性和活性位点的创建，这对氧化脱氢过程至关重要。

然而，需要注意的是，丙烷部分氧化和CO2-ODHP的反应机理可能不同，因此将这些结果直接外推到Fe氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中应该谨慎。需要进一步针对Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的研究来确认这些假设，并优化该过程的催化系统。

[1] "On both the reducible Ru doped ceria and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C."

[2] "Ceria is redox active metal oxide which when partially reduced contains abundant vacancies making the surface relatively basic and reactive to CO2 (a Lewis acid) forming carbonate intermediates. Whereas, zirconia is a less reducible oxide generally considered to be an acidic metal oxide and not as reactive for acidic CO2."

[3] "The O2 consumption obtained for 5% Ru doped CeO2 catalyst was considerably higher than 5% Ru doped ZrO2. Several studies reported that cerium oxide have a very high oxygen storage capacity."

[4] "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

The reducibility and support materials of Ru-doped oxide catalysts showed some influence on their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but not as much as might be expected. 

Ceria is a reducible, redox-active oxide with high oxygen storage capacity, while zirconia is less reducible and more acidic. Ru-doped ceria showed higher oxygen mobility and reducibility compared to Ru-doped zirconia. 

However, despite these differences in reducibility and support properties, both catalysts showed comparable activity for propane partial oxidation below 450°C, producing mainly CO and H2. Both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300°C, and their activities were nearly identical above 300°C.

This suggests that the reducibility of the oxide support had no significant effect on the catalyst activity for this reaction. The ruthenium metal loading appears to be the dominant factor influencing propane conversion, rather than the properties of the support oxide.

These findings provide insight that the reaction mechanism may not heavily depend on the redox properties or oxygen mobility of the support material. Instead, the active sites created by ruthenium doping seem to be the key factor. This suggests that optimizing the ruthenium loading and dispersion may be more important for improving catalytic performance than engineering the reducibility of the support oxide.

Ru掺杂氧化物催化剂的可还原性和载体材料对CO2-ODHP反应性能确实有一些影响,但影响程度并不如预期的那么大。

氧化铈是一种可还原的、具有氧化还原活性的氧化物,具有高氧储存能力,而氧化锆则不易还原且更具酸性。Ru掺杂的氧化铈表现出比Ru掺杂的氧化锆更高的氧移动性和可还原性。

然而,尽管在可还原性和载体特性方面存在这些差异,但两种催化剂在450°C以下的丙烷部分氧化活性相当,主要产物为CO和H2。两种催化剂在300°C以下对丙烷都没有反应活性,而在300°C以上它们的活性几乎相同。

这表明氧化物载体的可还原性对该反应的催化活性没有显著影响。钌金属的负载量似乎是影响丙烷转化的主要因素,而不是载体氧化物的性质。

这些发现提供了一个见解,即反应机理可能并不heavily依赖于载体材料的氧化还原性质或氧移动性。相反,钌掺杂产生的活性位点似乎是关键因素。这表明,优化钌的负载量和分散度可能比改进载体氧化物的可还原性更重要,以提高催化性能。

[1] "Ceria and zirconia are relatively inactive for reactions with alkanes. Atomic doping with 5% Ru activates both metal oxides for partial oxidation of propane with carbon dioxide as an oxidant."

[2] "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C."

[3] "We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

[4] "Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion."

The literature does not specifically discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights on how reducibility and support materials affect catalyst performance for propane partial oxidation with CO2:

1. Ruthenium doping activates both ceria and zirconia for this reaction, despite their inactivity when undoped.

2. While Ru-doped ceria showed higher reducibility than Ru-doped zirconia, both catalysts had similar activities above 300°C. The reducibility of the oxide support did not significantly affect catalyst activity.

3. The ruthenium metal loading had the largest effect on propane conversion, more so than the choice of oxide support.

These findings suggest that for this reaction, the active metal (Ru) plays a more crucial role than the reducibility or type of oxide support. This provides insight into optimizing catalytic systems, indicating that focus should be on the active metal rather than support properties. However, caution should be taken in directly applying these insights to Fe oxide catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions without further specific studies.

该文献并未具体讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而，它确实提供了一些关于还原性和支撑材料如何影响丙烷与CO2部分氧化反应的催化剂性能的见解：

1. 钌掺杂能够激活氧化铈和氧化锆进行这种反应，尽管它们在未掺杂时是不活跃的。

2. 虽然钌掺杂的氧化铈表现出比钌掺杂的氧化锆更高的还原性，但两种催化剂在300°C以上的活性相似。氧化物支撑体的还原性对催化剂活性没有显著影响。

3. 钌金属的负载量对丙烷转化率的影响最大，比氧化物支撑体的选择更为重要。

这些发现表明，对于这种反应，活性金属（钌）比氧化物支撑体的还原性或类型起着更关键的作用。这为优化催化系统提供了见解，表明应该关注活性金属而不是支撑体的性质。然而，在没有进行进一步具体研究的情况下，应谨慎地将这些见解直接应用于Fe氧化物催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。

The study does not directly examine Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, but instead focuses on Ru-doped CeO2 and ZrO2 catalysts for propane partial oxidation with CO2. However, some insights can be drawn from the results:

1. The reducibility of the support material significantly affects catalyst performance. Ru-doped CeO2 was more easily reduced and showed higher H2 uptake compared to Ru-doped ZrO2.

2. The more reducible Ru-doped CeO2 catalyst demonstrated higher catalytic activity (53% conversion) compared to the less reducible Ru-doped ZrO2 (22% conversion) under oxidative conditions.

3. Both catalysts produced mainly CO and H2, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism involving C-C bond cleavage and reforming rather than dehydrogenation.

4. The support material influenced product selectivity, with Ru-doped CeO2 producing some methane while Ru-doped ZrO2 did not.

These findings suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions, using a more reducible support material could potentially enhance catalytic activity. However, it may also affect product selectivity. Optimizing the balance between reducibility and desired product selectivity would be crucial for developing effective catalysts for this process.

这项研究并没有直接研究Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现,而是专注于Ru掺杂CeO2和ZrO2催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷部分氧化反应。然而,从结果中可以得出一些见解:

1. 载体材料的可还原性显著影响催化剂性能。Ru掺杂CeO2更容易被还原,并且显示出比Ru掺杂ZrO2更高的H2吸收量。

2. 在氧化条件下,可还原性更强的Ru掺杂CeO2催化剂表现出更高的催化活性(53%转化率),而可还原性较弱的Ru掺杂ZrO2的转化率为22%。

3. 两种催化剂主要产生CO和H2,这表明反应机理可能涉及C-C键断裂和重整,而非脱氢。

4. 载体材料影响产物选择性,Ru掺杂CeO2产生少量甲烷,而Ru掺杂ZrO2则不产生甲烷。

这些发现表明,对于CO2-ODHP反应,使用更易还原的载体材料可能会增强催化活性。然而,它也可能影响产物选择性。优化可还原性和所需产物选择性之间的平衡对于开发这一过程的有效催化剂至关重要。

[1] "The present work supports the following:
1) Both host oxides were inactive to propane and carbon dioxide when ruthenium was absent, doping with ruthenium increases CC cleavage and dry reforming activity of propane at modest temperatures."

[2] "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

[3] "Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion. The low rate of dehydrogenation in the absence of carbon dioxide suggests that the chemistry is not identical to ruthenium on an inert support."

[4] "Co-feeding CO2 substantially increased the activity for both catalysts and more CO was observed at high partial pressures of CO2. Both catalysts suffered from deactivation from coke formation. The addition of 25% O2 facilitated greater propane conversion, lower coke, and a greater syngas yield."

The literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into the influence of reducibility and support materials on Ru-doped catalysts for propane partial oxidation with CO2, which may offer some relevant principles:

1. The reducibility of the oxide support (ceria vs. zirconia) did not significantly affect catalyst activity for propane conversion, despite ceria being more reducible. This suggests that the redox properties of the support may not be the primary factor in determining catalyst performance.

2. The ruthenium metal loading had the largest effect on propane conversion, indicating that the active metal plays a more crucial role than the support material in this reaction.

3. The presence of CO2 as an oxidant significantly increased catalyst activity, suggesting that CO2 activation is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

4. The addition of O2 improved propane conversion and reduced coke formation, indicating that oxygen can play a beneficial role in the reaction and catalyst stability.

These insights suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions with Fe oxide-based catalysts:
- The reducibility of the support may not be the most critical factor
- The active metal (Fe in this case) loading and dispersion could be more important
- CO2 activation is likely a crucial step in the mechanism
- Co-feeding O2 might improve performance and stability

However, it's important to note that these conclusions are drawn from a study on Ru-based catalysts and may not directly apply to Fe oxide-based systems. Further research specific to Fe oxide catalysts would be needed to confirm these hypotheses for CO2-ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接涉及Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于可还原性和载体材料对Ru掺杂催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷部分氧化反应中影响的见解，这可能提供一些相关的原理：

1. 尽管氧化铈更易还原，但氧化物载体（氧化铈与氧化锆）的可还原性并未显著影响催化剂对丙烷转化的活性。这表明载体的氧化还原性能可能不是决定催化剂性能的主要因素。

2. 钌金属负载量对丙烷转化影响最大，表明在这种反应中，活性金属比载体材料起着更关键的作用。

3. CO2作为氧化剂的存在显著提高了催化剂活性，表明CO2的活化是反应机理中的关键步骤。

4. 添加O2改善了丙烷转化率并减少了积碳形成，表明氧气可以在反应和催化剂稳定性方面发挥有益作用。

这些见解表明，对于Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP反应：
- 载体的可还原性可能不是最关键的因素
- 活性金属（在这种情况下为Fe）的负载量和分散度可能更为重要
- CO2的活化可能是机理中的关键步骤
- 共进料O2可能会提高性能和稳定性

然而，需要注意的是，这些结论是从Ru基催化剂的研究中得出的，可能不能直接应用于Fe氧化物基系统。需要对Fe氧化物催化剂进行进一步的专门研究，以确认这些假设在CO2-ODHP反应中的适用性。
