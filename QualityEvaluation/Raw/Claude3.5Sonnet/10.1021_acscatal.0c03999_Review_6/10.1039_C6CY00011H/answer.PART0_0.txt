[1] "For the H2-TPR of Ru doped CeO2, the H2 partial pressure starts decreasing as the temperature reached to 100 C, and at the same time water signal observed in the mass spectrometer. The maximum amount of hydrogen consumed at 150 C, and this correlates the maximum amount of water produced at the same temperature confirmed from the change in partial pressure of H2 and H2O and the overall H2 uptake was 535 μmol g1."

[2] "In case of Ru doped ZrO2, the H2 uptake starts at around 200 C and the maximum H2 reduction occur at much higher temperature 350 C compare to Ru doped CeO2 catalyst. The H2 uptake calculation shows very low amount of H2 was consumed (137 μmol g1), considering ZrO2 is hardly reducible oxide (34 μmol g1)."

[3] "Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8). The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts. 5% Ru doped CeO2 makes methane while 5% Ru doped ZrO2 produce no methane."

The question cannot be directly answered based on the given literature, as it specifically asks about Fe oxide-based catalysts and CO2-ODHP reactions, which are not discussed in the provided text. However, we can draw some insights from the comparison of Ru-doped CeO2 and ZrO2 catalysts in propane partial oxidation with CO2.

The literature shows that the reducibility of the support material significantly influences catalyst performance. Ru-doped CeO2 is more easily reducible than Ru-doped ZrO2, as evidenced by lower reduction temperatures and higher H2 uptake. This higher reducibility correlates with better catalytic performance in propane partial oxidation, with Ru-doped CeO2 showing higher conversion (53%) compared to Ru-doped ZrO2 (22%).

The difference in reducibility affects product distribution as well. While both catalysts primarily produce CO and H2, only Ru-doped CeO2 produces methane, likely due to its higher reducibility and oxygen mobility.

These findings suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions with Fe oxide-based catalysts, using a more reducible support material might lead to higher catalytic activity and potentially different product distributions. The ease of reduction could facilitate oxygen mobility and the creation of active sites, which are crucial for oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

However, it's important to note that the reaction mechanisms for propane partial oxidation and CO2-ODHP may differ, so direct extrapolation of these results to Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions should be done cautiously. Further studies specifically on Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed to confirm these hypotheses and optimize the catalytic systems for this process.

虽然给定的文献没有直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂和CO2-ODHP反应，因此无法直接回答这个问题，但我们可以从Ru掺杂CeO2和ZrO2催化剂在丙烷部分氧化与CO2反应中的比较中得到一些见解。

文献表明，支撑材料的可还原性显著影响催化剂性能。Ru掺杂CeO2比Ru掺杂ZrO2更容易还原，这从较低的还原温度和较高的H2吸收量可以看出。这种较高的可还原性与丙烷部分氧化中更好的催化性能相关，Ru掺杂CeO2显示出更高的转化率（53%），而Ru掺杂ZrO2的转化率为22%。

可还原性的差异也影响产品分布。虽然两种催化剂主要产生CO和H2，但只有Ru掺杂CeO2产生甲烷，这可能是由于其较高的可还原性和氧移动性。

这些发现表明，对于Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP反应，使用更易还原的支撑材料可能会导致更高的催化活性和潜在的不同产品分布。还原的容易程度可能有助于氧的移动性和活性位点的创建，这对氧化脱氢过程至关重要。

然而，需要注意的是，丙烷部分氧化和CO2-ODHP的反应机理可能不同，因此将这些结果直接外推到Fe氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中应该谨慎。需要进一步针对Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的研究来确认这些假设，并优化该过程的催化系统。
