[1] "The present work supports the following:
1) Both host oxides were inactive to propane and carbon dioxide when ruthenium was absent, doping with ruthenium increases CC cleavage and dry reforming activity of propane at modest temperatures."

[2] "Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were unreactive towards propane below 300 C and their activities were nearly identical above 300 C. We conclude that the reducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the catalyst activity."

[3] "Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion. The low rate of dehydrogenation in the absence of carbon dioxide suggests that the chemistry is not identical to ruthenium on an inert support."

[4] "Co-feeding CO2 substantially increased the activity for both catalysts and more CO was observed at high partial pressures of CO2. Both catalysts suffered from deactivation from coke formation. The addition of 25% O2 facilitated greater propane conversion, lower coke, and a greater syngas yield."

The literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into the influence of reducibility and support materials on Ru-doped catalysts for propane partial oxidation with CO2, which may offer some relevant principles:

1. The reducibility of the oxide support (ceria vs. zirconia) did not significantly affect catalyst activity for propane conversion, despite ceria being more reducible. This suggests that the redox properties of the support may not be the primary factor in determining catalyst performance.

2. The ruthenium metal loading had the largest effect on propane conversion, indicating that the active metal plays a more crucial role than the support material in this reaction.

3. The presence of CO2 as an oxidant significantly increased catalyst activity, suggesting that CO2 activation is a key step in the reaction mechanism.

4. The addition of O2 improved propane conversion and reduced coke formation, indicating that oxygen can play a beneficial role in the reaction and catalyst stability.

These insights suggest that for CO2-ODHP reactions with Fe oxide-based catalysts:
- The reducibility of the support may not be the most critical factor
- The active metal (Fe in this case) loading and dispersion could be more important
- CO2 activation is likely a crucial step in the mechanism
- Co-feeding O2 might improve performance and stability

However, it's important to note that these conclusions are drawn from a study on Ru-based catalysts and may not directly apply to Fe oxide-based systems. Further research specific to Fe oxide catalysts would be needed to confirm these hypotheses for CO2-ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接涉及Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于可还原性和载体材料对Ru掺杂催化剂在CO2存在下丙烷部分氧化反应中影响的见解，这可能提供一些相关的原理：

1. 尽管氧化铈更易还原，但氧化物载体（氧化铈与氧化锆）的可还原性并未显著影响催化剂对丙烷转化的活性。这表明载体的氧化还原性能可能不是决定催化剂性能的主要因素。

2. 钌金属负载量对丙烷转化影响最大，表明在这种反应中，活性金属比载体材料起着更关键的作用。

3. CO2作为氧化剂的存在显著提高了催化剂活性，表明CO2的活化是反应机理中的关键步骤。

4. 添加O2改善了丙烷转化率并减少了积碳形成，表明氧气可以在反应和催化剂稳定性方面发挥有益作用。

这些见解表明，对于Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP反应：
- 载体的可还原性可能不是最关键的因素
- 活性金属（在这种情况下为Fe）的负载量和分散度可能更为重要
- CO2的活化可能是机理中的关键步骤
- 共进料O2可能会提高性能和稳定性

然而，需要注意的是，这些结论是从Ru基催化剂的研究中得出的，可能不能直接应用于Fe氧化物基系统。需要对Fe氧化物催化剂进行进一步的专门研究，以确认这些假设在CO2-ODHP反应中的适用性。
