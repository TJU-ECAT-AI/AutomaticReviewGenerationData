          [1] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[2] "Comparing the H2-TPR profiles of bulk V2O5 and 0WV sample, shown in Fig. 2, the reduction profile for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks at 660 C and 790 C while for 0WV only one signal at 580 C can be observed."

[3] "The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form"

[4] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

[5] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[6] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

          The literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into vanadium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, which may be applicable more broadly:

1. Reducibility and support material significantly impact catalyst performance. The structure, dispersion, and support characteristics affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The support material (SiO2) helps disperse vanadium oxide, leading to more easily reducible species compared to bulk V2O5. This higher reducibility could contribute to improved catalytic performance.

3. CO2 can partially re-oxidize reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4), enabling oxidative dehydrogenation. However, CO2 is a weaker oxidant than O2, only able to partially re-oxidize the vanadium species.

4. The reaction mechanism appears to involve multiple pathways occurring simultaneously:
   - Direct oxidative dehydrogenation 
   - Non-oxidative dehydrogenation
   - Reverse water gas shift reaction

5. Isotope labeling experiments helped elucidate these mechanistic details.

To optimize catalysts, careful control of the metal oxide reducibility and interactions with the support material seem important. The ability of CO2 to partially re-oxidize the catalyst while avoiding over-oxidation appears key to achieving good performance.

While these insights are for V-based catalysts, similar principles may apply in developing Fe oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. Further studies specifically on Fe-based systems would be needed to confirm this.

          该文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而,它提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢反应中的见解,这些见解可能更广泛地适用:

1. 还原性和载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。结构、分散性和载体特性影响催化活性和选择性。

2. 载体材料(SiO2)有助于分散钒氧化物,导致与体相V2O5相比更容易还原的物种。这种更高的可还原性可能有助于提高催化性能。

3. CO2可以部分再氧化还原态钒物种(V2O3到V2O4),从而实现氧化脱氢。然而,CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂,只能部分重新氧化钒物种。

4. 反应机理似乎涉及同时发生的多种途径:
   - 直接氧化脱氢
   - 非氧化脱氢
   - 逆水气变换反应

5. 同位素标记实验有助于阐明这些机理细节。

为了优化催化剂,谨慎控制金属氧化物的还原性和与载体材料的相互作用似乎很重要。CO2能够部分再氧化催化剂同时避免过度氧化,这一特性对于获得良好性能至关重要。

虽然这些见解是针对V基催化剂的,但在开发Fe氧化物催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应时可能适用类似原理。需要对Fe基系统进行进一步的专门研究以确认这一点。
