[1] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[2] "The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form"

[3] "The position of the peak remains unchanged and is approximately 580 C, indicating the reduction of amorphous monomeric VOx surface species and that the reducibility of all the samples remains the same."

[4] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[5] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

The literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the reducibility and support materials for V oxide-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions with CO2:

1. The reducibility of vanadium oxide species on SiO2 support was investigated using H2-TPR. The results showed a symmetrical reduction peak at 580°C, indicating the presence of isolated, monomeric VOx species. 

2. The addition of WOx to the catalyst did not change the reducibility of the VOx species.

3. CO2 was found to partially re-oxidize the reduced vanadium species, converting V2O3 to V2O4. This allows CO2 to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

4. Isotope labeling experiments revealed that the reaction proceeds through both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, as well as the reverse water gas shift reaction.

While these findings are for V oxide rather than Fe oxide catalysts, they demonstrate how studying reducibility and support interactions can provide mechanistic insights for dehydrogenation reactions with CO2. Similar approaches could potentially be applied to investigate Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而，它确实为V氧化物基催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应提供了一些关于还原性和支撑材料的见解：

1. 使用H2-TPR研究了SiO2支撑的钒氧化物物种的还原性。结果显示在580°C出现对称的还原峰，表明存在孤立的、单体的VOx物种。

2. 向催化剂中添加WOx并未改变VOx物种的还原性。

3. 发现CO2可以部分再氧化还原后的钒物种，将V2O3转化为V2O4。这使得CO2能够参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。

4. 同位素标记实验揭示了反应通过氧化和非氧化脱氢途径进行，同时伴随逆水气变换反应。

虽然这些发现是针对V氧化物而非Fe氧化物催化剂，但它们展示了研究还原性和支撑相互作用如何能为CO2参与的脱氢反应提供机理见解。类似的方法可能也适用于研究CO2-ODHP反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂。
