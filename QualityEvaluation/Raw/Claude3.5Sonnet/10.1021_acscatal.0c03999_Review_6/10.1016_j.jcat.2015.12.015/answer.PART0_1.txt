[1] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[2] "Comparing the H2-TPR profiles of bulk V2O5 and 0WV sample, shown in Fig. 2, the reduction profile for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks at 660 C and 790 C while for 0WV only one signal at 580 C can be observed."

[3] "The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form"

[4] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

The provided literature does not discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions specifically. However, it does provide some insights into the reducibility of vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation reactions involving CO2.

The reducibility of the catalysts was investigated using H2-TPR. For the VOx/SiO2 catalyst (0WV sample), a single reduction peak was observed at 580°C, indicating the presence of isolated, monomeric VOx species. This differs from bulk V2O5, which showed two reduction peaks at higher temperatures. 

The support material (SiO2) appears to help disperse the vanadium oxide, leading to more easily reducible species compared to bulk V2O5. This higher reducibility could contribute to improved catalytic performance.

When the reduced catalyst was re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2, only about 45% of the oxygen was regenerated. This suggests CO2 is a weaker oxidant than O2, only able to partially re-oxidize the vanadium species.

While not directly addressing the CO2-ODHP reaction mechanism, these findings suggest the redox properties of the supported metal oxide catalysts play an important role. The partial re-oxidation by CO2 likely influences the reaction pathway and catalyst regeneration steps. Optimizing the metal-support interactions to control reducibility and re-oxidation behavior could be important for developing improved catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions.

提供的文献并未具体讨论基于铁氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而,它确实为我们提供了一些关于二氧化硅负载的钒氧化物催化剂在涉及CO2的丙烷脱氢反应中的可还原性的见解。

使用H2-TPR研究了催化剂的可还原性。对于VOx/SiO2催化剂(0WV样品),在580°C观察到单一还原峰,表明存在孤立的、单体的VOx物种。这与体相V2O5不同,后者在更高温度下显示两个还原峰。

载体材料(SiO2)似乎有助于分散钒氧化物,导致与体相V2O5相比更容易还原的物种。这种更高的可还原性可能有助于提高催化性能。

当用CO2代替O2重新氧化还原后的催化剂时,只有约45%的氧被再生。这表明CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂,只能部分重新氧化钒物种。

虽然没有直接解决CO2-ODHP反应机理,但这些发现表明负载金属氧化物催化剂的氧化还原性质起着重要作用。CO2的部分再氧化可能影响反应途径和催化剂再生步骤。优化金属-载体相互作用以控制可还原性和再氧化行为可能对开发改进的CO2辅助脱氢反应催化剂很重要。
