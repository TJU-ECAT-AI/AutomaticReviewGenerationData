[1] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[2] "Comparing the H2-TPR profiles of bulk V2O5 and 0WV sample, shown in Fig. 2, the reduction profile for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks at 660 C and 790 C while for 0WV only one signal at 580 C can be observed."

[3] "The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form"

[4] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

[5] "This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides some relevant insights on the reducibility and support materials of vanadium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2:

1. The reducibility of vanadium oxide species is influenced by the support material. On SiO2 support, VOx exists in an isolated, monomeric form that is more easily reduced compared to bulk V2O5.

2. The support material affects the dispersion and structure of the active metal oxide, which in turn impacts reducibility and catalytic performance. 

3. CO2 is a weaker oxidant compared to O2, only able to partially re-oxidize reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4 instead of V2O5). This suggests CO2 plays a role in maintaining the catalyst in a partially reduced state during reaction.

4. The redox properties and oxygen exchange capacity of the catalyst are important for the reaction mechanism, likely following a Mars-van Krevelen type pathway involving lattice oxygen.

While not directly addressing Fe oxide catalysts, these insights on V oxide systems provide a framework for understanding how reducibility and support interactions could influence catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions more broadly. Optimizing the reducibility, dispersion, and oxygen exchange properties through choice of support and promoters would likely be key strategies for developing effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

该文献并未直接讨论基于铁氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而,它提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢反应中的可还原性和载体材料的相关见解:

1. 钒氧化物物种的可还原性受载体材料的影响。在SiO2载体上,VOx以孤立的单体形式存在,与块状V2O5相比更容易被还原。

2. 载体材料影响活性金属氧化物的分散性和结构,进而影响可还原性和催化性能。

3. 与O2相比,CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂,只能部分再氧化还原的钒物种(V2O3氧化到V2O4而不是V2O5)。这表明CO2在反应过程中起到维持催化剂处于部分还原状态的作用。

4. 催化剂的氧化还原性质和氧交换能力对反应机理很重要,可能遵循涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen类型途径。

虽然没有直接涉及铁氧化物催化剂,但这些关于钒氧化物体系的见解为更广泛地理解可还原性和载体相互作用如何影响CO2辅助脱氢反应中的催化剂性能和反应机理提供了框架。通过选择合适的载体和助剂来优化可还原性、分散性和氧交换性质,可能是开发有效CO2-ODHP催化剂的关键策略。
