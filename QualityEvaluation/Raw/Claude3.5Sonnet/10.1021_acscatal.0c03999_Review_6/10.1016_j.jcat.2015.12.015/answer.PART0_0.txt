[1] "The catalytic activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) depends on its structure, dispersion and the characteristics of its supporting material."

[2] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[3] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

The literature does not specifically discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into vanadium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, which may be applicable more broadly:

1. The reducibility and support material significantly impact catalyst performance. The structure, dispersion and support characteristics affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. CO2 can partially re-oxidize reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4), enabling oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The reaction mechanism appears to involve multiple pathways occurring simultaneously:
   - Direct oxidative dehydrogenation 
   - Non-oxidative dehydrogenation
   - Reverse water gas shift reaction

4. Isotope labeling experiments helped elucidate these mechanistic details.

To optimize catalysts, careful control of the metal oxide reducibility and interactions with the support material seem important. The ability of CO2 to partially re-oxidize the catalyst while avoiding over-oxidation appears key to achieving good performance.

While these insights are for V-based catalysts, similar principles may apply in developing Fe oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. Further studies specifically on Fe-based systems would be needed to confirm this.

该文献并未具体讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。但是,它提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢反应中的见解,这些见解可能更广泛地适用:

1. 还原性和载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。结构、分散性和载体特性影响催化活性和选择性。

2. CO2可以部分再氧化还原态钒物种(V2O3到V2O4),从而实现氧化脱氢。

3. 反应机理似乎涉及同时发生的多种途径:
   - 直接氧化脱氢
   - 非氧化脱氢
   - 逆水气变换反应

4. 同位素标记实验有助于阐明这些机理细节。

为了优化催化剂,谨慎控制金属氧化物的还原性和与载体材料的相互作用似乎很重要。CO2能够部分再氧化催化剂同时避免过度氧化,这一特性对于获得良好性能至关重要。

虽然这些见解是针对V基催化剂的,但在开发Fe氧化物催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应时可能适用类似原理。需要对Fe基系统进行进一步的专门研究以确认这一点。
