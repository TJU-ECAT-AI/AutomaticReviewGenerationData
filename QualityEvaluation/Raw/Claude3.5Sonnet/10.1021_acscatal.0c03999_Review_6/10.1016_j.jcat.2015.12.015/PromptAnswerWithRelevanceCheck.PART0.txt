[1] "The catalytic activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) depends on its structure, dispersion and the characteristics of its supporting material."

[2] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[3] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

The literature does not specifically discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into vanadium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, which may be applicable more broadly:

1. The reducibility and support material significantly impact catalyst performance. The structure, dispersion and support characteristics affect the catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. CO2 can partially re-oxidize reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4), enabling oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. The reaction mechanism appears to involve multiple pathways occurring simultaneously:
   - Direct oxidative dehydrogenation 
   - Non-oxidative dehydrogenation
   - Reverse water gas shift reaction

4. Isotope labeling experiments helped elucidate these mechanistic details.

To optimize catalysts, careful control of the metal oxide reducibility and interactions with the support material seem important. The ability of CO2 to partially re-oxidize the catalyst while avoiding over-oxidation appears key to achieving good performance.

While these insights are for V-based catalysts, similar principles may apply in developing Fe oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions. Further studies specifically on Fe-based systems would be needed to confirm this.

该文献并未具体讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的应用。但是,它提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢反应中的见解,这些见解可能更广泛地适用:

1. 还原性和载体材料显著影响催化剂性能。结构、分散性和载体特性影响催化活性和选择性。

2. CO2可以部分再氧化还原态钒物种(V2O3到V2O4),从而实现氧化脱氢。

3. 反应机理似乎涉及同时发生的多种途径:
   - 直接氧化脱氢
   - 非氧化脱氢
   - 逆水气变换反应

4. 同位素标记实验有助于阐明这些机理细节。

为了优化催化剂,谨慎控制金属氧化物的还原性和与载体材料的相互作用似乎很重要。CO2能够部分再氧化催化剂同时避免过度氧化,这一特性对于获得良好性能至关重要。

虽然这些见解是针对V基催化剂的,但在开发Fe氧化物催化剂用于CO2-ODHP反应时可能适用类似原理。需要对Fe基系统进行进一步的专门研究以确认这一点。

[1] "H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support."

[2] "Comparing the H2-TPR profiles of bulk V2O5 and 0WV sample, shown in Fig. 2, the reduction profile for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks at 660 C and 790 C while for 0WV only one signal at 580 C can be observed."

[3] "The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form"

[4] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2."

The provided literature does not discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions specifically. However, it does provide some insights into the reducibility of vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation reactions involving CO2.

The reducibility of the catalysts was investigated using H2-TPR. For the VOx/SiO2 catalyst (0WV sample), a single reduction peak was observed at 580°C, indicating the presence of isolated, monomeric VOx species. This differs from bulk V2O5, which showed two reduction peaks at higher temperatures. 

The support material (SiO2) appears to help disperse the vanadium oxide, leading to more easily reducible species compared to bulk V2O5. This higher reducibility could contribute to improved catalytic performance.

When the reduced catalyst was re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2, only about 45% of the oxygen was regenerated. This suggests CO2 is a weaker oxidant than O2, only able to partially re-oxidize the vanadium species.

While not directly addressing the CO2-ODHP reaction mechanism, these findings suggest the redox properties of the supported metal oxide catalysts play an important role. The partial re-oxidation by CO2 likely influences the reaction pathway and catalyst regeneration steps. Optimizing the metal-support interactions to control reducibility and re-oxidation behavior could be important for developing improved catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions.

提供的文献并未具体讨论基于铁氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而,它确实为我们提供了一些关于二氧化硅负载的钒氧化物催化剂在涉及CO2的丙烷脱氢反应中的可还原性的见解。

使用H2-TPR研究了催化剂的可还原性。对于VOx/SiO2催化剂(0WV样品),在580°C观察到单一还原峰,表明存在孤立的、单体的VOx物种。这与体相V2O5不同,后者在更高温度下显示两个还原峰。

载体材料(SiO2)似乎有助于分散钒氧化物,导致与体相V2O5相比更容易还原的物种。这种更高的可还原性可能有助于提高催化性能。

当用CO2代替O2重新氧化还原后的催化剂时,只有约45%的氧被再生。这表明CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂,只能部分重新氧化钒物种。

虽然没有直接解决CO2-ODHP反应机理,但这些发现表明负载金属氧化物催化剂的氧化还原性质起着重要作用。CO2的部分再氧化可能影响反应途径和催化剂再生步骤。优化金属-载体相互作用以控制可还原性和再氧化行为可能对开发改进的CO2辅助脱氢反应催化剂很重要。

The literature does not directly address Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the reducibility and support materials for V oxide-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions with CO2:

1. The reducibility of vanadium oxide species on SiO2 support was investigated using H2-TPR. The results showed a symmetrical reduction peak at 580°C, indicating the presence of isolated, monomeric VOx species. 

2. The addition of WOx to the catalyst did not change the reducibility of the VOx species.

3. CO2 was found to partially re-oxidize the reduced vanadium species, converting V2O3 to V2O4. This allows CO2 to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

4. Isotope labeling experiments revealed that the reaction proceeds through both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, as well as the reverse water gas shift reaction.

While these findings are for V oxide rather than Fe oxide catalysts, they demonstrate how studying reducibility and support interactions can provide mechanistic insights for dehydrogenation reactions with CO2. Similar approaches could potentially be applied to investigate Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而，它确实为V氧化物基催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应提供了一些关于还原性和支撑材料的见解：

1. 使用H2-TPR研究了SiO2支撑的钒氧化物物种的还原性。结果显示在580°C出现对称的还原峰，表明存在孤立的、单体的VOx物种。

2. 向催化剂中添加WOx并未改变VOx物种的还原性。

3. 发现CO2可以部分再氧化还原后的钒物种，将V2O3转化为V2O4。这使得CO2能够参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。

4. 同位素标记实验揭示了反应通过氧化和非氧化脱氢途径进行，同时伴随逆水气变换反应。

虽然这些发现是针对V氧化物而非Fe氧化物催化剂，但它们展示了研究还原性和支撑相互作用如何能为CO2参与的脱氢反应提供机理见解。类似的方法可能也适用于研究CO2-ODHP反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂。

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides some relevant insights on the reducibility and support materials of vanadium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2:

1. The reducibility of vanadium oxide species is influenced by the support material. On SiO2 support, VOx exists in an isolated, monomeric form that is more easily reduced compared to bulk V2O5.

2. The support material affects the dispersion and structure of the active metal oxide, which in turn impacts reducibility and catalytic performance. 

3. CO2 is a weaker oxidant compared to O2, only able to partially re-oxidize reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4 instead of V2O5). This suggests CO2 plays a role in maintaining the catalyst in a partially reduced state during reaction.

4. The redox properties and oxygen exchange capacity of the catalyst are important for the reaction mechanism, likely following a Mars-van Krevelen type pathway involving lattice oxygen.

While not directly addressing Fe oxide catalysts, these insights on V oxide systems provide a framework for understanding how reducibility and support interactions could influence catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions more broadly. Optimizing the reducibility, dispersion, and oxygen exchange properties through choice of support and promoters would likely be key strategies for developing effective catalysts for CO2-ODHP.

该文献并未直接讨论基于铁氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应。然而,它提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷脱氢反应中的可还原性和载体材料的相关见解:

1. 钒氧化物物种的可还原性受载体材料的影响。在SiO2载体上,VOx以孤立的单体形式存在,与块状V2O5相比更容易被还原。

2. 载体材料影响活性金属氧化物的分散性和结构,进而影响可还原性和催化性能。

3. 与O2相比,CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂,只能部分再氧化还原的钒物种(V2O3氧化到V2O4而不是V2O5)。这表明CO2在反应过程中起到维持催化剂处于部分还原状态的作用。

4. 催化剂的氧化还原性质和氧交换能力对反应机理很重要,可能遵循涉及晶格氧的Mars-van Krevelen类型途径。

虽然没有直接涉及铁氧化物催化剂,但这些关于钒氧化物体系的见解为更广泛地理解可还原性和载体相互作用如何影响CO2辅助脱氢反应中的催化剂性能和反应机理提供了框架。通过选择合适的载体和助剂来优化可还原性、分散性和氧交换性质,可能是开发有效CO2-ODHP催化剂的关键策略。
