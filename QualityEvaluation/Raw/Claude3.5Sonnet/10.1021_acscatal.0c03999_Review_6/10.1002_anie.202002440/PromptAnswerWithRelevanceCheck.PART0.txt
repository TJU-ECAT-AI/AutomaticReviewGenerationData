Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The document primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It does not discuss iron oxide catalysts, their reducibility, support materials, or their influence on CO2-ODHP reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的任何信息。该文档主要关注六方氮化硼(h-BN)和氧化硼催化剂用于丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)。它没有讨论氧化铁催化剂、它们的可还原性、载体材料或它们对CO2-ODHP反应的影响。因此,根据提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
