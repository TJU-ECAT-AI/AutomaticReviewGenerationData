[1] "Figure 8 shows the results of TPR-H2 for the catalyst Ga(10%)Ox/Silica and the support. The process of gallium reduction came into play at 510520C; that is, the catalyst surface was partially reduced by the hydrogen formed at the reaction temperature of propane dehydrogenation (600C)."

[2] "Note that the GaOx/SiO2 systems began to be reduced in the presence of hydrogen at a temperature of 510520, and they were reduced only partially under dehydrogenation conditions (600) because a maximum of H2 absorption on TPR was observed at  > 800."

[3] "In the case of CrOx/SiO2 at 600C, chromium was rapidly reduced to the oxidation states 2+ and 3+ depending on the particle size. In this case, the large agglomerates of CrOx (mainly Cr2O3) were very difficult to reoxidize; ions within these agglomerates were inaccessible to oxygen and, obviously, propane, and they did almost not participate in dehydrogenation."

[4] "The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."

The literature does not directly discuss Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. However, based on the information provided about Ga and Cr oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, we can draw some insights that may be relevant:

1. Reducibility: The reducibility of the catalyst significantly affects its performance. Partial reduction of the catalyst surface occurs under reaction conditions, which is important for catalytic activity. For example, Ga oxide catalysts begin to reduce at 510-520°C and are only partially reduced at the reaction temperature of 600°C.

2. Support materials: Low-acidity silicate supports are beneficial as they decrease coke formation and increase the effective operation times of the catalysts. The acid properties of the support play a role in dispersing the active phase and influencing catalyst stability.

3. Particle size and dispersion: The size of the metal oxide particles affects their reducibility and accessibility to reactants. Larger agglomerates (e.g., Cr2O3) are difficult to reoxidize and may not participate in the reaction.

4. Reaction mechanism: While not explicitly stated for Fe oxide catalysts, the information suggests that the presence of reduced metal species is important for catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

To optimize Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, one might consider:
- Using low-acidity silicate supports to minimize coke formation
- Ensuring good dispersion of the active phase on the support
- Tailoring the reducibility of the Fe oxide to achieve an optimal balance of oxidation states under reaction conditions
- Considering the role of CO2 in the reaction mechanism, as it may affect the oxidation state of the active metal and compete for adsorption sites with hydrocarbons

虽然文献没有直接讨论基于Fe氧化物的催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应，但根据提供的关于丙烷脱氢反应中Ga和Cr氧化物催化剂的信息，我们可以得出一些可能相关的见解：

1. 可还原性：催化剂的可还原性显著影响其性能。在反应条件下催化剂表面的部分还原对催化活性很重要。例如，Ga氧化物催化剂在510-520°C开始还原，在600°C的反应温度下只有部分还原。

2. 载体材料：低酸性硅酸盐载体是有益的，因为它们减少了积炭形成并增加了催化剂的有效运行时间。载体的酸性质在分散活性相和影响催化剂稳定性方面起作用。

3. 粒子大小和分散性：金属氧化物粒子的大小影响其可还原性和对反应物的可及性。较大的聚集体（如Cr2O3）难以重新氧化，可能不参与反应。

4. 反应机理：虽然没有明确说明Fe氧化物催化剂的情况，但信息表明还原态金属物种的存在对脱氢反应的催化活性很重要。

为了优化CO2-ODHP反应的Fe氧化物基催化剂，可以考虑：
- 使用低酸性硅酸盐载体以最小化积炭形成
- 确保活性相在载体上的良好分散
- 调整Fe氧化物的可还原性，以在反应条件下达到氧化态的最佳平衡
- 考虑CO2在反应机理中的作用，因为它可能影响活性金属的氧化态并与碳氢化合物竞争吸附位点
