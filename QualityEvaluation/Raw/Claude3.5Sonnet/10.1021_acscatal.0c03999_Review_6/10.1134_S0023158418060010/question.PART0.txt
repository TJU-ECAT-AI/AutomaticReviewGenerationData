AbstractThe catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica
gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary
(a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the
course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined. It was found that the relatively low acidity of silica gels
prevents intense coke deposition and has a positive effect on the stability of catalyst operation. At the same
time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface.
In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low
specific activity of these systems. It was found that the appearance and growth of catalytic activity with tem-
perature was accompanied by the formation of the reduced forms of gallium oxide, the fraction of which was
limited under the conditions of dehydrogenation (600C). It was established that CO2 hindered the adsorp-
tion of propane on the surface of catalysts to decrease its conversion; at the same time, it prevented the
adsorption of propylene and its further conversion into coke. In the case of the chromium systems, the
increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen
upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect. This negative effect was more pronounced for
the gallium catalysts, and this led to a decrease of the propylene yield.

Catalytic systems based on chromium, along with
platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial
catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1].
Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are
characterized by high coke deposition during opera-
tion [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates
the use of cyclic regeneration procedures. An alterna-
tive to aluminum oxide can be various silicate carriers,
which possess low acidity, developed surface, and
porosity, for example, amorphous silica gels [3, 4], or
mesoporous materials with a regular structure (MSM,
SBA, MSU, etc.) [59]. Intensively studied chro-
mium catalysts on their basis demonstrate high activity
and stability. Another way to increase the efficiency of
dehydrogenation of light paraffins is to carry out the
process in the presence of oxidizing additives, which
remove hydrogen from the reaction and remove coke.
The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occur-
rence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2
is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently
utilize this greenhouse gas [1]. Studies of the effect of
carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of
C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are
promising lines in the development of these processes
because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on
both the activity and the yield of olefins [39]. With
respect to the dehydrogenation of paraffins, gallium
catalysts have been studied relatively recently. These
systems are less active, but they are characterized by
high selectivity and stability [1, 1013], which can be
very important for their industrial implementation.
Despite a large number of studies, many questions
related to the basic, acidbase, and oxidationreduc-
tion properties of catalysts and carriers and the mech-
anisms of the reactions remain open questions. The
acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was
not considered in detail, although acid sites, espe-
cially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption
of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization
and coke deposition. The properties of the active sur-
face and support under the conditions of dehydroge-
nation (at a high temperature and in a reducing atmo-
sphere) are poorly understood, and there are almost
no works on a comparison between the adsorption
characteristics of reaction system components in the
dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 on
chromium oxide and gallium oxide catalysts. In this
work, the use of a nonstationary response method

made it possible to carry out such a comparison by
analyzing the relaxation of the system in terms of H2,
CO, and C3H6 upon the introduction of CO2 in the
dehydrogenation of propane. In addition, the catalytic
properties of Ga- and Cr-containing systems during
long-term operation, the acid and redox properties of
catalysts and supports, and their interrelation and role
in the process of dehydrogenation were considered.
EXPERIMENTAL
The catalysts were prepared by precipitation from
the aqueous solutions of chromium or gallium
nitrates. Silica gel of KSKG grade with a BET specific
surface area (SBET) of 330360 m2/g, Silica gel for
chromatography (Acros, CAS 7631-86-9) with SBET =
480550 m2/g, and, for comparison, γ-Al2O3 (A-64)
with SBET = 196 m2/g were used as supports. The chro-
mium oxide catalysts contained 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and
5.0 wt % chromium. The gallium content was varied
within a range of 2.060 wt %. In all of the tests, the
catalyst samples were pretreated in a flow of oxygen at
600C for 8 h. The activity of the catalysts was studied
in a flow setup at atmospheric pressure, 600C, and a
space velocity of 200 h1 using a mixture of the follow-
ing composition (vol % ): C3H8 (15), CO2 (30), and N2
(55). The series of long-term experiments were con-
ducted: three or four cycles of 600800 min. The reac-
tion products were analyzed chromatographically on
an LKhM-8MD instrument (Khromatograf, USSR)
with two columns packed with molecular sieves 5A
(H2, N2, CH4, and CO) and Porapak-Q (CO2, C1C3
hydrocarbons, and H2O).
The adsorption characteristics of the reaction sys-
tem components were obtained using a nonstationary
response method. The experiments were carried out in
a flow setup containing three independent lines. The ini-
tial partial pressures of propane and carbon dioxide were
varied over ranges of 0.1250.33 and 0.300.75 atm,
respectively. The reactor was connected to an MSKh-6
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (USSR), which
allowed us to analyze the reaction mixture directly
during relatively fast relaxation processes. The condi-
tions of the process ensured that it proceeded in the
differential reactor mode. Relaxation curves were
obtained upon a sharp change in the concentrations of
the starting materials, mainly at 600C. The adsorp-
tion and desorption studies of the reaction system
components and experiments on the mutual displace-
ment of propylene and carbon dioxide were also car-
ried out at 200C. The following mass numbers were
measured in the course of the experiments: 2 (hydro-
gen), 15 (methane), 18 (water), 28 (carbon monox-
ide), 29 (propane), 41 (propylene), and 44 (carbon
dioxide). The catalysts contained 1.0% chromium and
10.0% gallium. In each experiment, the mass number
of only one substance was measured at regular inter-
vals of 1 s; therefore, the relaxation curves were almost
continuous on the time scale shown in the figures.
Diffuse Reflectance UVVis spectroscopy mea-
surements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda19 (United State) instrument equipped with
an integrating sphere with the internal surface covered
inside with BaSO4. A glass unit equipped with a quartz
cell with an optical window of quartz was used for gas
treatment and evacuation of catalysts at different tem-
peratures, and the test samples were placed in this cell.
The TPR-H2 and TPD-NH3 data were obtained on
a flow system equipped with a linear sample heating
system and a thermal conductivity detector. Before the
TPR measurements, the samples were processed in a
flow of helium at 300C for 2 h. A mixture of H2 : Ar =
10 : 90 (vol %) was used for the TPR-H2; the feed rate
of the mixture was 2 L/h, and the heating rate was
20C/min. The resulting water was frozen out before
entering the detector. Before the TPD-NH3 measure-
ments, the weighed portions of catalysts were treated
in a flow of H2 or He for 1 h; thereafter, the adsorption
of ammonia from a mixture with nitrogen ([NH3] =
15 vol %) was performed at room temperature with the
subsequent gas stripping at temperatures of 50, 120,
150, or 210C for 1 h. The TPD-NH3 was carried out
in a flow of helium (2 L/h) at a heating rate of
15C/min.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows a comparative evaluation of the
operation of supported chromium- and gallium-con-
taining catalysts with similar molar Cr and Ga con-
centrations in the dehydrogenation of propane.
According to the TPD-NH3 data, the acidity of the
supports was 1822 mmol NH3/100 g for KSKG or
7080 mmol NH3/100 g for γ-Al2O3, which is used for
the preparation of industrial catalysts for the dehydro-
genation of light paraffins.
According to the experiments, the main processes
related to changes in the active surface were complete
after 300 min of catalyst operation. The results showed
that the more acidic aluminum oxide provoked active
coke deposition to decrease the yield of propylene.
The high initial activity of the catalysts (90% for
CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and 70% for GaOx/γ-Al2O3) strongly
decreased after 5 h. It is likely that a higher activity of
GaOx/γ-Al2O3, as compared with that of GaOx/KSKG,
indicates the more disperse supporting of the active
phase in the case of γ-Al2O3. The advantage of inert
silicate supports for Cr- and Ga-containing samples is
obvious because their use can significantly increase
the time of the continuous work of catalysts with the
retention of the high yields of olefins.
Figure 2a shows the dependence of propane con-
version upon the operation time of fresh CrOx/KSKG
catalysts containing 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 wt % chromium.

It can be seen that the activity of the catalysts
increased with the chromium content; in this case, all
of the samples were characterized by a decrease in
activity during operation. The initial activity and its
change in catalysts with 1.0 and 2.0 wt % chromium in
the next two cycles after regeneration were similar; this
fact indicates the relative stability of the active surface
of these samples. The catalyst containing 3.0 wt %
chromium behaved differently: its activity in the sec-
ond and third cycles was much lower than that in a
fresh sample (differences were as high as 10%). Ana-
lyzing the dependence of the yield of propylene on the
operation time of the samples (Fig. 3), we can note
that, at chromium concentrations of 23 wt %, the
curves exhibited maximums, which were obviously
associated with changes in the properties of the active
surface; these changes were mainly determined by the
reduction of a chromium oxide phase (from Cr6+ to
Cr3+ and Cr2+) and active coke deposition at the initial
moment. It is likely that this process proceeds very
rapidly at low chromium concentrations, and the
reducibility of the active phase decreases with the
amount of chromium in the sample due to an increase
in the size of agglomerates [8]. Note that the yield of
propylene on regenerated chromium catalysts may be
greater than that on fresh ones. This indicates a high
activity of the fresh surface in the side reactions of
cracking and coke deposition. Indeed, the oxidized
surface of catalysts promotes methanation, as evi-
denced by significant methane concentrations in reac-
tion products in the initial period of operation (60
100 min). The effect is enhanced with increasing chro-
mium content. Agglomeration also decreases the over-
all activity of the catalysts, to a greater extent, in crack-
ing reactions.
Carbon dioxide was actively consumed under the
conditions of propane dehydrogenation, especially, in
the first hour of operation. During this time his con-
version can drop almost three times. As the chromium
content was increased, the conversion of CO2
increased (the initial values of the conversion of CO2
for 
Cr(1%)Ox/KSKG, 
Cr(2%)Ox/KSKG, 
and
Cr(3%)Ox/KSKG were 24, 37, and 48%, respectively).
It is obvious that coke, which actively filled a fresh sur-
face, strongly inhibited the interaction of carbon diox-
ide with dehydrogenation hydrogen.
Figures 2b and 4 show data on the conversion of
propane and the yield of propylene on gallium oxide
catalysts supported onto Silica gel. The conversion
increased with the gallium content; however, the rate
of deactivation also increased in this case, especially in
the first hours of operation. This can be due to both a
change in the active surface of the catalysts and an
increase in the rate of coke deposition with an increase
in the active metal concentration. At high gallium
contents, the active surface actually degenerated into
an array of gallium oxide, which allowed us to recog-
nize the influence of the support. In terms of propyl-
ene yield, its role is positive (Fig. 4) because the effi-
ciency of propylene production has a maximum
(about [Ga] = 15%) depending on the amount of gal-
lium in the samples. However, catalysts with gallium
contents of 40 and 60 wt % exhibited greater stability;
moreover, they developed, and the yield of propylene
on them slightly increased after regeneration. It is
obvious that considered catalytic systems have limita-
tions in terms of the dispersity of the active phase,
which limits their specific activity.
In contrast to the chromium oxide systems, a con-
siderable decrease in the conversion of CO2 in the first
hour of operation was not observed in the dehydroge-
nation of propane on the gallium oxide catalysts, thus
conversion decreased almost three times for ten working
hours. The conversion of CO2 increased as the gallium
content was increased up to 40 wt % (the maximum con-
versions for Ga(10%)Ox/KSKG, Ga(20%)Ox/KSKG,
Ga(40%)Ox/KSKG, and Ga(60%)Ox/KSKG were 4,

10, 29, and 21%, respectively), but its further increase
was limited, apparently, by a decrease in the concen-
tration of dehydrogenation hydrogen.
Figure 5 shows the relaxation curves of changes in
the concentration of propylene with time on the catalysts
Cr(1%)Ox/KSKG (Fig. 5a) and Ga(10%)Ox/KSKG
(Fig. 5b) in the responses of He/(He + C3H8) (curve 1),
He/(CO2 + C3H8) (curve 2), and (He + CO2)/(CO2 +
C3H8) (curve 3) at a temperature of 600C. It can be
seen that a delay in the appearance of propylene in the
gas phase varied depending on the composition of the
reaction mixture and the initial state of the catalyst. It
was the smallest when the reaction mixture contained
no CO2 and the largest on the supply of a reaction mix-
ture of propane and carbon dioxide to the catalyst with
preadsorbed carbon dioxide. In the latter case, addi-
tional time was required for the adsorption of propane
on the surface of catalysts occupied by CO2. On the
chromium oxide catalyst, the delays in the appearance
of propylene and the times required for reaching a
steady state upon the introduction of CO2 were shorter
than those on gallium oxide. The advantage of CO2
over C3H8 on their competitive adsorption can be a
reason for the delay. The difference in the strength of
adsorption 
of 
the 
dioxide 
and 
propane 
on
GaOx/KSKG is stronger than that on the chromium-
containing catalyst. In addition, in the responses of

(CO2 + C3H8)/He for the Cr- and Ga-containing cat-
alysts, the appearance time of propylene was longer
than that in the response of (CO2 + C3H8)/(He +
CO2); this fact is indicative of the competitive adsorp-
tion of CO2 and propylene. The responses to the
mutual displacement of CO2 and propylene on both
types of the catalysts obtained at 600C showed that,
when propylene was displaced with carbon dioxide,
propylene appeared in the gas phase earlier than car-
bon dioxide on its displacement with propylene; that
is, carbon dioxide more easily displaced propylene
than propylene displaced carbon dioxide. On the
chromium oxide catalyst, differences between the total
displacement of propylene with carbon dioxide (12 s)
and carbon dioxide (15 s) with propylene were smaller
than those on the gallium oxide catalyst (14 and 24 s,
respectively). Thus, CO2 was adsorbed more strongly
than propylene on both of the catalysts and more strongly
on the gallium oxide catalyst than on the chromium
oxide catalyst. Similar responses obtained at 200C con-
firmed these conclusions; in this case, the response and
delay times in them increased.
Figure 6 shows the relaxation curves of changes in
the hydrogen concentration with time obtained in the
responses of (He + C3H8)/(C3H8 + CO2) on the chro-
mium oxide (Fig. 6a) and gallium oxide (Fig. 6b) cat-
alysts. The main reason for a decrease in the hydrogen
concentration is the reaction CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O.
The natures and rates of decrease in the concentration
of H2 were very different for the gallium and chro-
mium samples; obviously, the above reaction proceeds
faster in the presence of the chromium oxide system.
Indeed, the times taken for establishing stationary
states were 20 and 10 s on the gallium oxide and
chromium oxide catalysts, respectively.
In responses to the introduction of CO2 onto the
coked surfaces of gallium- and chromium-containing
catalysts, CO was formed primarily due to the
Boudouard reaction CO2 + C = 2CO; moreover, the
oxidation of metal oxide surfaces of the samples, espe-
cially chromium oxide, can occur. The appearance of
CO in the responses on both of the catalysts indicated
the important role of CO2 in reducing coke formation,
but the low conversion of CO2 (12%) indicated that
the oxidation of coke was slow.
Thus, in the dehydrogenation of propane on chro-
mium oxide catalysts, CO2 actively participated in the
reverse water gas shift reaction and oxidized coke to
increase the yield of propylene and the stability of opera-
tion. In the case of the gallium oxide systems, CO2 was a
strong competitor to propane on adsorption, and the
yield of propylene could slightly decrease.
Numerous studies [39] showed that the structure
and properties of chromium oxide catalysts depend to
a large extent on the method of preparation, the chro-
mium content, and the processing conditions. Earlier
[5], we found that a relatively uniform application to
silica gel can be achieved at chromium contents to 5 wt %.
The agglomeration of an active phase was observed
with increasing chromium concentration; it was
enhanced in a reducing atmosphere of propane dehy-
drogenation and facilitated the appearance of large
Cr2O3 and CrO agglomerates (with chromium con-
tents above 3 wt %), which are difficult to oxidize even
in a flow of oxygen at 600C. Thus, agglomeration led
to a decrease in the availability of chromium-contain-

ing centers for interaction with the gas phase compo-
nents.
The results of the UV-diffuse reflectance studies
obtained for the Cr(5%)Ox/KSGG sample confirmed
these conclusions (Fig. 7). It can be seen that the char-
acteristic bands of chromates at 22000, 28000, and
38000 cm1 were observed on a fresh oxidized sample
(curve 1) [13]. Upon the addition of propane (40 Torr)
for 20 min at a temperature of 600C (curve 2), the
intensity of these bands decreased and a band
appeared at 16500 cm1, which was attributed to the
dd transitions of triply charged chromium in the lat-
tice of α-Cr2O3 in the case of chromium oxide systems
[13]. The subsequent supply of oxygen (100 Torr) at
600C and treatment for 1 h did not lead to the com-
plete oxidation of crystalline chromium oxide (curve 4),
whose peak disappeared only after treatment in an
oxygen flow at atmospheric pressure for 2 h at 600C
(curve 5).
Figure 8 shows the results of TPR-H2 for the cata-
lyst Ga(10%)Ox/Silica and the support. The process of
gallium reduction came into play at 510520C; that
is, the catalyst surface was partially reduced by the
hydrogen formed at the reaction temperature of pro-
pane dehydrogenation (600C). Similar temperatures
of reduction were found [14, 15] for gallium catalysts
supported onto silica gel. Takahara et al. [14] demon-
strated that the treatment of the Ga(1.7%)/SiO2 cata-
lyst with hydrogen at 550C reduced 30% oxygen in
Ga2O3. It is likely that the specific activity of Ga-con-
taining samples was lower than that of Cr-containing
ones due to the mechanism of paraffin activation,
which requires the presence of centers with the oxida-
tion states of gallium lower than 3+, rather than the
lower dispersity of gallium oxide.
As we have shown above, the acid properties of the
support and catalyst play an important role in coke
formation and catalyst deactivation; thus, we consider
this matter in more detail. Figure 9a shows the results
of TPD-NH3 for chromium-containing catalysts and
KSKG pretreated with hydrogen at 600C. The reduc-
tion of the samples with hydrogen makes it possible to
bring the systems closer to their state in a reducing
atmosphere of propane dehydrogenation. It can be
seen that a significant portion of acid sites belonged to
the support, especially, in the region of weak acidity.
The acidity of the samples increased with the chro-
mium content mainly due to medium and strong acid

sites. Usually, desorption curves are decomposed to
separate individual peaks at different temperatures;
this is difficult to perform if the peaks are not explicitly
expressed. In addition to the decomposition of the
curves, a series of experiments on the desorption of
ammonia carried out at different temperatures will be
helpful for obtaining additional information on acid
sites. Figure 9b shows the results obtained in this series
of experiments selectively for the catalyst with a chro-
mium content of 3 wt % pretreated in He at 600C. It
can be seen that the desorption of NH3 after blowing at
60C is insufficiently informative because the bulk of
adsorbed ammonia consists of weakly bound adsorp-
tion species, which probably do not play an important
role in catalysis at a temperature of 600C. An increase
in the desorption temperature has shown that many
ammonia adsorption sites of different strengths
occurred on the surface of the catalyst.
Table 1 summarizes a detailed comparison of the
amounts of ammonia desorbed from catalysts con-
taining 1 and 3 wt % chromium. Treatment with
hydrogen at 600C significantly decreased the number
of weak adsorption sites, which were mainly different
hydroxyls, up to the pre-blowing temperature Tb =
160C, but the situation changed at Tb = 210C. This
is understandable because it is evident that strong acid
sites are the reduced forms of a chromium oxide
phase, that is, Lewis acid sites. Starting with Tb =
120C, the concentration of acid sites in the reduced
sample with a chromium content of 3 wt % was higher
than that in the catalyst containing 1 wt % Cr, but this
difference was small. This was likely due to a decrease
in the dispersity of the active phase with increasing
amount of chromium in the catalyst.
The major portion of the Ga-containing samples
were prepared based on the chromatographic Silica
gel, which possessed a lower acidity than that of
KSKG silica gel (Fig. 10). The results of the study of
the acidity of the two different forms of silica gel indi-
cate that the prevalence of weak acid sites was charac-
teristic of KSKG, in contrast to Silica, where medium-
strength acid sites were predominant. Reductive treat-
ment led to a strong decrease in the latter on both types
of silica gel. The reduced acidity and a higher specific
surface area of Silica would have to give it an advantage
over KSKG as a support of dehydrogenation catalysts,
but the experimentally obtained data gave an opposite
result. Figure 11 shows the histogram of a comparison
between the activities of Cr- and Ga-containing sam-
ples supported onto KSKG and Silica in the dehydro-
genation of propane in the presence of CO2 after
300 min of operation. For both of the systems, the use
of KSKG silica gel was preferred in terms of the yield
of propylene. It is likely that the acid hydroxyls of the
support, which are weak acid sites, participate in the
formation of the active surface to facilitate the disper-
sion of the active phase in the course of catalyst prepa-
ration.

PROPANE DEHYDROGENATION ON CHROMIUM OXIDE

Figure 12 illustrates the results of the studies on the
acidity of GaOx/Silica catalysts. In the case of gallium
catalysts, the pretreatment temperature in helium
(Fig. 12a) and hydrogen (Fig. 12b) was 650C because
it was found that ammonia adsorption sites in these
systems are stronger than those in chromium systems.
Up to [Ga] = 15 wt %, the acidity of the samples did
not undergo significant changes. A further increase in
the concentration of gallium strongly changed the acid
properties of the catalysts; this was probably due to the
formation of an individual phase of gallium oxide. The
effect of hydrogen treatment was clearly manifested as
the initial temperature of ammonia desorption was
increased to 160C (Fig. 12b). The reductive treatment
of Ga-containing samples, as well as chromium sys-
tems and silica gels, led to a decrease in the number of
weak and medium acid sites, that is, to a decrease in
the surface concentration of acid hydroxyls.
Comparing the acidity of supported gallium cata-
lysts with their activity in the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane, note that the acid properties of these systems do
not have a strong effect on the efficiency of olefin pro-
duction. There was a negative effect only at a gallium
content higher than 20 wt %, when gallium oxide
degenerated into a separate agglomerated phase. A dif-
ferent result was observed in the case of chromium
oxide systems, when an increase in the chromium
content was accompanied by an increase in the acidity,
activity, and propylene yield on the dehydrogenation
of propane. The experimental data are indicative of
different mechanisms of propane dehydrogenation in
the presence of chromium and gallium systems. More-
over, the Ga-containing catalysts exhibit low specific
activity. One of the reasons for this is the low dispersity
of the active phase on the surface of a silicate support.
As found experimentally, the strength of binding of
gallium oxide and chromium oxide particles to the
surface of a silicate support is caused by the acidity of
the support. It is likely that Brnsted acid sites are
important for the production of effective catalysts: a
high surface concentration of these sites promotes the
dispersion of the active phase. The weak fixation of the
active phase leads to its active diffusion and agglomer-
ation at a high temperature in a reducing atmosphere
of dehydrogenation or to a decrease in specific activity
upon prolonged operation. At the same time, the

strong acid sites of the support, being the centers of
olefin adsorption, play a negative role in the dehydro-
genation to provoke active coke deposition, which was
observed in the case of the use of alumina as a support.
Note that the GaOx/SiO2 systems began to be
reduced in the presence of hydrogen at a temperature
of 510520, and they were reduced only partially
under dehydrogenation conditions (600) because a
maximum of H2 absorption on TPR was observed at 
> 800. The appearance and growth of catalytic
activity with temperature was accompanied by the for-
mation of reduced gallium oxide species and an
increase in their concentration; however, their fraction
was limited under the dehydrogenation conditions. In
the case of CrOx/SiO2 at 600C, chromium was rap-
idly reduced to the oxidation states 2+ and 3+ depend-
ing on the particle size. In this case, the large agglom-
erates of CrOx (mainly Cr2O3) were very difficult to
reoxidize; ions within these agglomerates were inac-
cessible to oxygen and, obviously, propane, and they
did almost not participate in dehydrogenation.
CONCLUSIONS
The results obtained in this study demonstrated
that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the

preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased
coke formation and increased the effective operation
times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems. At the same
time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an
important role in the formation of a disperse active
surface. However, in order to increase the specific
activity and stability of the catalysts, it is necessary to
provide not only the disperse application but also the
strong fixation of the dispersed particles of an active
phase on the surface of a silicate support, which is dif-
ficult to perform with the use of a deposition method.
The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction
of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and
the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with pro-
pane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an
oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is
adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively
with the hydrocarbons. Preventing the adsorption of
olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent
polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of
propane by preventing its adsorption. In the case of
gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly
complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a
decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxi-
dation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon
dioxide because the presence of these species is neces-
sary for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the case of
chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propyl-
ene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation
of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2
prevail over the negative influence.
