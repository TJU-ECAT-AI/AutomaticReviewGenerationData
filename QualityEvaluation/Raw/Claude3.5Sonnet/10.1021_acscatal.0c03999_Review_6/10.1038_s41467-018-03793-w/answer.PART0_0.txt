[1] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

[2] "In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions"

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "To account for the potential FeONi interfacial active sites based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface."

The literature does not directly address how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the role of support materials and the oxidation state of Fe in the catalytic system.

The study used ceria (CeO2) as a support material due to its oxygen storage/release capability, which may facilitate CO2 activation and help suppress coke formation. This suggests that the choice of support material can significantly impact catalyst performance.

In situ XANES measurements revealed that under reaction conditions, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remained in an oxidized state, while Ni was in a metallic form. This observation led to further investigation of the FeO/Ni interface as a potential active site for the reaction.

DFT calculations on the FeO/Ni(111) interface showed that the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway (CH bond cleavage) was more favorable than the reforming pathway (CC bond cleavage). This suggests that the presence of oxidized Fe species may play a crucial role in promoting the selective formation of propylene.

These findings indicate that the oxidation state of Fe and the interaction between Fe oxide and metallic Ni at the interface are important factors in determining catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions. The study suggests that maintaining Fe in an oxidized state while keeping Ni metallic may be beneficial for propylene selectivity.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, future research could focus on:
1. Exploring support materials that can stabilize the desired oxidation states of the active metals.
2. Investigating methods to control the formation and stability of metal-oxide interfaces.
3. Studying the effects of different Fe:Ni ratios and their impact on the formation of active sites.
4. Developing strategies to enhance the oxygen storage/release capabilities of the support material to improve CO2 activation and coke resistance.

虽然文献没有直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，但它提供了一些关于支撑材料作用和Fe氧化态在催化体系中的作用的见解。

研究使用了氧化铈（CeO2）作为支撑材料，因为它具有储存/释放氧的能力，可能有助于CO2的活化并抑制积碳形成。这表明支撑材料的选择可以显著影响催化剂的性能。

原位XANES测量显示，在反应条件下，Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe保持氧化态，而Ni则处于金属态。这一观察结果促使研究者进一步研究FeO/Ni界面作为潜在的活性位点。

对FeO/Ni(111)界面的DFT计算表明，氧化脱氢途径（C-H键断裂）比重整途径（C-C键断裂）更有利。这表明氧化态Fe物种的存在可能在促进丙烯的选择性形成中起着关键作用。

这些发现表明，Fe的氧化态以及Fe氧化物与金属Ni在界面处的相互作用是决定CO2-ODHP反应催化剂性能的重要因素。研究表明，保持Fe处于氧化态而Ni保持金属态可能有利于丙烯的选择性。

为了优化这一过程的催化体系，未来的研究可以集中在：
1. 探索能够稳定活性金属所需氧化态的支撑材料。
2. 研究控制金属-氧化物界面形成和稳定性的方法。
3. 研究不同Fe:Ni比例及其对活性位点形成的影响。
4. 开发增强支撑材料氧储存/释放能力的策略，以改善CO2活化和抗积碳性能。
