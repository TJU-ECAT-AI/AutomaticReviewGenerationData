[1] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

[2] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[3] "To account for the potential FeONi interfacial active sites based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface."

The literature does not directly discuss the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts or compare different support materials for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the role of the support and the oxidation state of Fe that are relevant to the question:

1. CeO2 is highlighted as a good support material due to its oxygen storage/release capability and ability to induce CO2 activation. This suggests that reducible oxide supports like CeO2 may be beneficial for CO2-ODHP reactions.

2. In situ XANES measurements showed that Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remained in an oxidized state under reaction conditions, while Ni was metallic. This indicates that Fe oxide species may play an important role in the active sites for CO2-ODHP.

3. DFT calculations considered FeO/Ni interfacial sites to account for the observed oxidized Fe, suggesting these may be important active sites for selective CH bond activation.

These insights suggest that the interaction between oxidized Fe species and the support, as well as with other metallic components (e.g., Ni), may be crucial for CO2-ODHP performance. The reducibility of Fe oxide species and their stabilization by the support material likely influence the formation and stability of active sites. Optimizing these interactions through careful selection of support materials and catalyst compositions could be a promising approach for improving CO2-ODHP catalysts.

虽然文献没有直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性或比较CO2-ODHP反应的不同载体材料，但它确实提供了一些关于载体作用和Fe氧化态的见解，这些与问题相关：

1. CeO2被强调为一种良好的载体材料，因为它具有储存/释放氧的能力，并能诱导CO2的活化。这表明像CeO2这样的可还原氧化物载体可能对CO2-ODHP反应有益。

2. 原位XANES测量显示，在反应条件下，Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe保持氧化态，而Ni是金属态。这表明Fe氧化物物种可能在CO2-ODHP的活性位点中发挥重要作用。

3. DFT计算考虑了FeO/Ni界面位点，以解释观察到的氧化Fe，表明这些可能是选择性CH键活化的重要活性位点。

这些见解表明，氧化Fe物种与载体之间的相互作用，以及与其他金属成分（如Ni）的相互作用，可能对CO2-ODHP性能至关重要。Fe氧化物物种的可还原性及其被载体材料稳定化可能影响活性位点的形成和稳定性。通过仔细选择载体材料和催化剂组成来优化这些相互作用，可能是改进CO2-ODHP催化剂的一种有前景的方法。
