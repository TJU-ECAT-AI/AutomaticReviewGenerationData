[1] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

[2] "In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions"

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "To account for the potential FeONi interfacial active sites based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface."

The literature does not directly address how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the role of support materials and the oxidation state of Fe in the catalytic system.

The study used ceria (CeO2) as a support material due to its oxygen storage/release capability, which may facilitate CO2 activation and help suppress coke formation. This suggests that the choice of support material can significantly impact catalyst performance.

In situ XANES measurements revealed that under reaction conditions, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remained in an oxidized state, while Ni was in a metallic form. This observation led to further investigation of the FeO/Ni interface as a potential active site for the reaction.

DFT calculations on the FeO/Ni(111) interface showed that the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway (CH bond cleavage) was more favorable than the reforming pathway (CC bond cleavage). This suggests that the presence of oxidized Fe species may play a crucial role in promoting the selective formation of propylene.

These findings indicate that the oxidation state of Fe and the interaction between Fe oxide and metallic Ni at the interface are important factors in determining catalyst performance for CO2-ODHP reactions. The study suggests that maintaining Fe in an oxidized state while keeping Ni metallic may be beneficial for propylene selectivity.

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, future research could focus on:
1. Exploring support materials that can stabilize the desired oxidation states of the active metals.
2. Investigating methods to control the formation and stability of metal-oxide interfaces.
3. Studying the effects of different Fe:Ni ratios and their impact on the formation of active sites.
4. Developing strategies to enhance the oxygen storage/release capabilities of the support material to improve CO2 activation and coke resistance.

虽然文献没有直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能，但它提供了一些关于支撑材料作用和Fe氧化态在催化体系中的作用的见解。

研究使用了氧化铈（CeO2）作为支撑材料，因为它具有储存/释放氧的能力，可能有助于CO2的活化并抑制积碳形成。这表明支撑材料的选择可以显著影响催化剂的性能。

原位XANES测量显示，在反应条件下，Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe保持氧化态，而Ni则处于金属态。这一观察结果促使研究者进一步研究FeO/Ni界面作为潜在的活性位点。

对FeO/Ni(111)界面的DFT计算表明，氧化脱氢途径（C-H键断裂）比重整途径（C-C键断裂）更有利。这表明氧化态Fe物种的存在可能在促进丙烯的选择性形成中起着关键作用。

这些发现表明，Fe的氧化态以及Fe氧化物与金属Ni在界面处的相互作用是决定CO2-ODHP反应催化剂性能的重要因素。研究表明，保持Fe处于氧化态而Ni保持金属态可能有利于丙烯的选择性。

为了优化这一过程的催化体系，未来的研究可以集中在：
1. 探索能够稳定活性金属所需氧化态的支撑材料。
2. 研究控制金属-氧化物界面形成和稳定性的方法。
3. 研究不同Fe:Ni比例及其对活性位点形成的影响。
4. 开发增强支撑材料氧储存/释放能力的策略，以改善CO2活化和抗积碳性能。

The literature does not directly address how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the role of support materials and the oxidation state of Fe in the catalytic system.

The study uses ceria (CeO2) as a support material due to its ability to store and release oxygen, which can facilitate CO2 activation and suppress coke formation. This suggests that the redox properties of the support play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance.

The XANES data reveals that under reaction conditions, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remains in an oxidized state, while Ni is in its metallic form. This indicates that the Fe oxide species are stable under reaction conditions and may be crucial for the catalyst's activity.

The DFT calculations considering the FeO/Ni(111) interface suggest that the oxidized Fe species interact with Ni to create active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This implies that maintaining Fe in its oxidized state is important for the catalyst's selectivity towards propylene production.

These findings suggest that the reducibility of Fe oxide species should be carefully controlled to maintain the desired oxidation state under reaction conditions. The support material (in this case, CeO2) plays a vital role in stabilizing the active species and promoting the desired reaction pathway. Future optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on tailoring the redox properties of both the active metal species and the support material to enhance catalyst performance and selectivity.

考虑FeO/Ni(111)界面的DFT计算表明，氧化的Fe物种与Ni相互作用，为丙烷的氧化脱氢创造活性位点。这意味着保持Fe的氧化状态对于催化剂向丙烯生产的选择性很重要。

这些发现表明，应该仔细控制Fe氧化物物种的可还原性，以在反应条件下维持所需的氧化态。支撑材料（在本例中为CeO2）在稳定活性物种和促进所需反应途径方面起着重要作用。未来针对CO2-ODHP的催化系统优化应该集中在调整活性金属物种和支撑材料的氧化还原性质，以提高催化剂性能和选择性。

The literature does not directly discuss the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts or compare different support materials for CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the role of the support and the oxidation state of Fe that are relevant to the question:

1. CeO2 is highlighted as a good support material due to its oxygen storage/release capability and ability to induce CO2 activation. This suggests that reducible oxide supports like CeO2 may be beneficial for CO2-ODHP reactions.

2. In situ XANES measurements showed that Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remained in an oxidized state under reaction conditions, while Ni was metallic. This indicates that Fe oxide species may play an important role in the active sites for CO2-ODHP.

3. DFT calculations considered FeO/Ni interfacial sites to account for the observed oxidized Fe, suggesting these may be important active sites for selective CH bond activation.

These insights suggest that the interaction between oxidized Fe species and the support, as well as with other metallic components (e.g., Ni), may be crucial for CO2-ODHP performance. The reducibility of Fe oxide species and their stabilization by the support material likely influence the formation and stability of active sites. Optimizing these interactions through careful selection of support materials and catalyst compositions could be a promising approach for improving CO2-ODHP catalysts.

2. In situ XANES measurements revealed that under reaction conditions, Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remains in an oxidized state, while Ni is in a metallic state.

3. The presence of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni in the Fe3Ni catalyst suggests the formation of FeONi interfacial active sites, which were further investigated using DFT calculations.

4. These FeONi interfacial sites were found to favor the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway over reforming, consistent with experimental observations.

These findings suggest that the partial oxidation of Fe in Fe oxide-based catalysts, combined with the oxygen storage/release properties of the CeO2 support, may play a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP reaction mechanism. The ability to maintain Fe in an oxidized state while keeping Ni metallic appears to be beneficial for selectivity towards propylene production. 

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, future research could focus on:

1. Fine-tuning the oxidation states of metal components in bimetallic catalysts.
2. Exploring other support materials with similar oxygen storage/release properties.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects between partially oxidized metals and the support material.
4. Developing strategies to maintain the desired oxidation states and interfacial sites under reaction conditions.

The literature does not provide direct information on how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. The choice of support material, specifically CeO2, plays an important role in the catalyst's performance. CeO2 has the ability to store and release oxygen, which can help induce CO bond scission in CO2 and provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression.

2. The oxidation state of Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst under reaction conditions is oxidized, while Ni remains in its metallic form. This suggests that the Fe oxide component may be important for the catalyst's activity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. The presence of CO2 can increase propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which consumes H2.

These observations suggest that the interplay between the reducibility of Fe oxide and the oxygen storage capacity of the CeO2 support may be crucial for the catalyst's performance. The oxidized state of Fe during the reaction indicates that maintaining this oxidation state might be important for the CO2-ODHP mechanism. Further research would be needed to fully understand the relationship between Fe oxide reducibility and catalyst performance, as well as to optimize the catalytic system for this process.
