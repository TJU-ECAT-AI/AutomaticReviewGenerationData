[1] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermodynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."

[2] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression9,2325."

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

The literature does not provide direct information on how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. The choice of support material, specifically CeO2, plays an important role in the catalyst's performance. CeO2 has the ability to store and release oxygen, which can help induce CO bond scission in CO2 and provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression.

2. The oxidation state of Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst under reaction conditions is oxidized, while Ni remains in its metallic form. This suggests that the Fe oxide component may be important for the catalyst's activity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. The presence of CO2 can increase propane conversion through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which consumes H2.

These observations suggest that the interplay between the reducibility of Fe oxide and the oxygen storage capacity of the CeO2 support may be crucial for the catalyst's performance. The oxidized state of Fe during the reaction indicates that maintaining this oxidation state might be important for the CO2-ODHP mechanism. Further research would be needed to fully understand the relationship between Fe oxide reducibility and catalyst performance, as well as to optimize the catalytic system for this process.

虽然文献中没有直接提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性如何影响CO2-ODHP反应性能的信息，但从提供的信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 支撑材料的选择，特别是CeO2，在催化剂性能中起着重要作用。CeO2具有储存和释放氧的能力，这可以帮助诱导CO2中CO键的断裂，并提供晶格氧以抑制积碳。

2. 在反应条件下，Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe处于氧化状态，而Ni保持金属态。这表明Fe氧化物组分可能对催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的活性很重要。

3. CO2的存在可以通过逆水气变换反应消耗H2，从而增加丙烷的转化率。

这些观察结果表明，Fe氧化物的可还原性与CeO2支撑体的氧储存能力之间的相互作用可能对催化剂的性能至关重要。反应过程中Fe的氧化状态表明，保持这种氧化状态可能对CO2-ODHP机理很重要。需要进一步研究以充分理解Fe氧化物可还原性与催化剂性能之间的关系，以及优化这一过程的催化系统。
