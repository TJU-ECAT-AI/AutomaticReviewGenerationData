[1] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

[2] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[3] "To account for the potential FeONi interfacial active sites based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface."

The literature does not directly address how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the role of support materials and the oxidation state of Fe in the catalytic system.

The study uses ceria (CeO2) as a support material due to its ability to store and release oxygen, which can facilitate CO2 activation and suppress coke formation. This suggests that the redox properties of the support play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance.

The XANES data reveals that under reaction conditions, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remains in an oxidized state, while Ni is in its metallic form. This indicates that the Fe oxide species are stable under reaction conditions and may be crucial for the catalyst's activity.

The DFT calculations considering the FeO/Ni(111) interface suggest that the oxidized Fe species interact with Ni to create active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This implies that maintaining Fe in its oxidized state is important for the catalyst's selectivity towards propylene production.

These findings suggest that the reducibility of Fe oxide species should be carefully controlled to maintain the desired oxidation state under reaction conditions. The support material (in this case, CeO2) plays a vital role in stabilizing the active species and promoting the desired reaction pathway. Future optimization of catalytic systems for CO2-ODHP should focus on tailoring the redox properties of both the active metal species and the support material to enhance catalyst performance and selectivity.

该文献并未直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。然而，它提供了一些关于支撑材料和Fe氧化态在催化系统中作用的见解。

研究使用氧化铈（CeO2）作为支撑材料，因为它具有储存和释放氧的能力，可以促进CO2的活化并抑制积碳形成。这表明支撑材料的氧化还原性质在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。

XANES数据显示，在反应条件下，Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe保持氧化状态，而Ni处于金属状态。这表明Fe氧化物物种在反应条件下是稳定的，可能对催化剂的活性至关重要。

考虑FeO/Ni(111)界面的DFT计算表明，氧化的Fe物种与Ni相互作用，为丙烷的氧化脱氢创造活性位点。这意味着保持Fe的氧化状态对于催化剂向丙烯生产的选择性很重要。

这些发现表明，应该仔细控制Fe氧化物物种的可还原性，以在反应条件下维持所需的氧化态。支撑材料（在本例中为CeO2）在稳定活性物种和促进所需反应途径方面起着重要作用。未来针对CO2-ODHP的催化系统优化应该集中在调整活性金属物种和支撑材料的氧化还原性质，以提高催化剂性能和选择性。
