[1] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

[2] "In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were conducted in order to identify the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions"

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "To account for the potential FeONi interfacial active sites based on the in situ experimental observation of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, further DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the FeO/Ni(111) interface."

The literature does not provide direct information on how the reducibility of Fe oxide-based catalysts influences their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the role of the support material and oxidation states in the catalytic process:

1. CeO2 is identified as a good support material due to its oxygen storage/release capability, which may facilitate CO2 activation and suppress coke formation.

2. In situ XANES measurements revealed that under reaction conditions, Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst remains in an oxidized state, while Ni is in a metallic state.

3. The presence of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni in the Fe3Ni catalyst suggests the formation of FeONi interfacial active sites, which were further investigated using DFT calculations.

4. These FeONi interfacial sites were found to favor the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway over reforming, consistent with experimental observations.

These findings suggest that the partial oxidation of Fe in Fe oxide-based catalysts, combined with the oxygen storage/release properties of the CeO2 support, may play a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP reaction mechanism. The ability to maintain Fe in an oxidized state while keeping Ni metallic appears to be beneficial for selectivity towards propylene production. 

To optimize catalytic systems for this process, future research could focus on:

1. Fine-tuning the oxidation states of metal components in bimetallic catalysts.
2. Exploring other support materials with similar oxygen storage/release properties.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects between partially oxidized metals and the support material.
4. Developing strategies to maintain the desired oxidation states and interfacial sites under reaction conditions.

虽然文献没有直接提供Fe氧化物基催化剂的可还原性如何影响CO2-ODHP反应性能的信息，但它确实对支撑材料和氧化态在催化过程中的作用提供了一些见解：

1. CeO2被认为是一种良好的支撑材料，因为它具有储存/释放氧的能力，这可能有助于CO2的活化和抑制积碳的形成。

2. 原位XANES测量显示，在反应条件下，Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe保持氧化态，而Ni处于金属态。

3. Fe3Ni催化剂中氧化态Fe和金属态Ni的存在表明形成了FeONi界面活性位点，这些位点通过DFT计算进行了进一步研究。

4. 这些FeONi界面位点被发现更倾向于氧化脱氢路径而非重整路径，这与实验观察一致。

这些发现表明，Fe氧化物基催化剂中Fe的部分氧化，结合CeO2支撑材料的氧储存/释放特性，可能在CO2-ODHP反应机理中起着关键作用。保持Fe处于氧化态而Ni保持金属态的能力似乎有利于丙烯生成的选择性。

为了优化这一过程的催化系统，未来的研究可以集中在：

1. 精细调节双金属催化剂中金属组分的氧化态。
2. 探索具有类似氧储存/释放特性的其他支撑材料。
3. 研究部分氧化金属与支撑材料之间的协同效应。
4. 开发在反应条件下维持所需氧化态和界面位点的策略。
