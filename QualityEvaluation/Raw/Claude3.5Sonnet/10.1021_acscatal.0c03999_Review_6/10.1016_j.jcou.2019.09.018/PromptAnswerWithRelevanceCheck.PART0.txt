Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-ODHP reactions. The text focuses on Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts or their reducibility in relation to CO2-ODHP reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或CO2-ODHP反应的信息。该文本主要讨论了含Cr的Beta沸石催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢的情况。文中没有提到Fe氧化物催化剂或它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的可还原性。因此,无法根据所提供的文档回答这个问题。
