Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The document focuses on Mo2C catalysts supported on various materials like SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and ZSM-5 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. It does not discuss Fe oxide catalysts or their reducibility. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中不包含任何关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能的信息。该文档主要讨论了以SiO2、Al2O3、TiO2和ZSM-5等材料为载体的Mo2C催化剂,用于利用CO2进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。文中没有讨论Fe氧化物催化剂或其可还原性。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) reactions. The document primarily discusses Mo2C-based catalysts supported on various materials like SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and ZSM-5 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. It does not mention iron oxide catalysts or their reducibility. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.
