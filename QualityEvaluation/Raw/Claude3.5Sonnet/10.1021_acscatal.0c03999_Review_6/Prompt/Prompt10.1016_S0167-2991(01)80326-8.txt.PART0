Following the interaction of propane with Mo2C/SiO2 at 373-573 K, the formation of 7r- 
bonded and di-o-bonded propylene, and propylidyne were identified by Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy. The presence of CO2 exerted very little influence on the formation of 
these surface species. CO2 adsorbs weakly and non-dissociatively on Mo2C catalysts below 
773 K. At higher temperature CO2 oxidizes the Mo2C; this process was followed by X-ray 
photoelectron 
spectroscopy. Mo2C/SiO2 is an effective catalyst for the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane. The selectivity to propylene at 773-873 K is 85-90 % The yield 
of propylene production is -11% at 943 K. Other hydrocarbon products are ethylene, methane 
and butane. It is assumed that the Mo oxycarbide formed in the reaction between CO2 and 
Mo2C plays an important role in the activation of propane. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Mo2C deposited on ZSM-5 was found to be an effective catalyst in the high temperature 
conversion of methane into benzene [1-6]. The selectivity of benzene formation is 80-85% at 
a conversion level of 8-10% [3,4]. This work was initiated by the results published by Wang 
et al. [7,8], whose starting catalyst was MoO3/ZSM-5, and by the observation that MoO3 has 
been converted into other compounds during the reaction accompanied by the deposition of a 
large amount of carbon [9]. As no benzene formation occurred on pure Mo2C [2,3], it was 
assumed that the primary role of Mo2C is to activate the C-H bond of methane and to produce 
CHx fragments. Further reactions, particularly the oligomerization of ethylene, proceed on the 
acidic sites of ZSM-5. The study of the chemistry of the reaction intermediates, CH2, CH3 and 
C2H5, on Mo2C/Mo(100) surface in UHV system by means of several spectroscopic methods 
disclosed further details of the complex process, namely that CH3 decomposes to CH2 on 
Mo2C and the recombination of CH2 can possibly also occur on Mo2C catalyst [11,12]. 
Mo2C/ZSM-5 exhibited a high activity in the aromatization of ethane [ 13 
] and propane [ 14]. 
Recently, we found the Mo2C prepared on SiO2 is an effective catalyst for the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant [ 15]. The selectivity to ethylene at 850- 
923 K was 90-95% at an ethane conversion of 8-30%. In the present paper the catalytic 
performance of supported Mo2C is examined in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
Hexagonal M02C was prepared by the method of Boudart et al. [16]. Supported Mo2C 
catalyst was prepared by the earburation of calcined MoO3/SiO2 in the catalytic reactor [3]. 
340 
MoO3/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnating silica (Cab-O-Sil, area: 200 m2/g) with a 
basic solution of ammonium paramolybdate to yield a nominal 2wt% of MOO3. The 
adsorption of reacting gases and that of the products of the reaction was studied by Fourier 
transform IR spectroscopy using a Biorad spectrometer (FTS 155). For IR measurements the 
MoO3/SiO2 sample was pressed into 10x30 mm self-supporting disc, and the carburation of 
the disc was performed in the infra red cell. The reaction of propane with supported MOO3, 
and the oxidation of Mo2C with CO2 were followed in situ by XPS (Kratos XSAM 800). 
Catalytic reaction was carried out at 1 atm of pressure in a fixed-bed, continuous flow 
reactor consisting of a quartz tube connected to a capillary tube [3,14]. The flow rate was in 
most cases 12 ml/min. The carrier gas was Ar. The propane content was 12.5%, which was 
kept constant in all experiments. Generally 0.5 g of loosely compressed catalyst sample was 
applied. Reaction products were analyzed gas chromatographically with a Hewlett-Packard 
5890 gas chromatograph and a Porapak QS column [3,14]. 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1. Adsorption of CO2 and C31 
The interaction of CO2 with supported MozC catalyst has been first examined by FTIR 
spectroscopy. Adsorption of CO2 (50 Tort) on Mo2C/SiO2 at 300 K produced no absorption 
bands. Heating the sample in the presence of CO2 and registering the IR spectrum at 250 K, 
below the thermal desorption of CO from Mo,zC (Tp = 337 K [17]), we observed weak CO 
band at 2050 cm 
"l above 773 K. Mass spectrometric analysis of the gas phase indicated the 
formation of gaseous CO first at 823 K, suggesting the dissociation of CO2 and/or its reaction 
with Mo2C. The latter process was followed by XPS in the temperature range of C3H8 + CO2 
reaction. 
In Fig.lA we show the XPS spectra of Mo2C/SiO2 treated with CO2. It shows that CO2 
reacts slowly with Mo2C at 873 K, but the oxidation of Mo can be clearly seen by the 
appearance of new peaks at 233.3 and 236.2 eV. In the presence of CO2 + C3H8 gas mixture 
only very little change is observed in the XPS spectra of the sample, suggesting the 
occurrence of a fast reaction between Mo-O species and propane. 
Before the study of the interaction of propane with Mo2C, we examined the reaction 
between MoO3 and propane. From previous measurements it appeared that MoO3 is converted 
into Mo2C in the methane flow at 973 K [3-5]. This formation of Mo2C occurred at much 
lower temperature, at 773 K, with ethane [13]. The carburation was almost complete in 5 
hours. Propane proved to be also an effective carburizing compound. In propane flow at 873 
K, the characteristic binding energies of Mo2C already appeared at 10 min. Relevant XPS 
spectra are presented in Fig. lB. Characteristic XPS data for different Mo compounds are 
collected in Table 1. 
The absorption bands observed following the adsorption of propane on Mo2C/SiO2 at 150- 
250 K correspond very well to the different vibrations of adsorbed propane. At 573 K, 
however, new spectral features appeared at 2925, 1429, 1411 and 1374 cm", which suggests 
that a fraction of propane interacted strongly with Mo2C. Taking into account the spectral 
features of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne on Mo2C/SiO2 [ 
14] and on Pt/SiO2 [ 18,19], 
these absorption bands are attributed to adsorbed propylene formed in the dehydrogenation of 
propane. At higher temperature two weak bands at 1407 and 1367 cm 
"z were identified which 
we order to the vibrations of propylidyne. This suggests that a fraction of adsorbed propylene 
converted into propylidyne.

This hydrocarbon compound was produced in higher concentration by the adsorption of 
propylene on Mo2C/SiO2 at 300 K, when all its characteristic absorption bands were 
observed. The above surface species were also detected following the adsorption of propane 
on Pt/SiO2 by Sheppard et al. [18,19]. Accordingly, the reactivity of highly dispersed Mo2C 
towards propane and propylene is not much less than that of supported Pt catalyst. 
The same IR spectroscopic measurements have been carried out in the presence of CO2. 
We found practically identical spectral features as in the absence of CO2 with slight variation 
in the position and intensities of the absorption bands. 
3.2. Catalytic studies 
First we tested the catalytic effect of pure Mo2C. The ratio of the gas mixture, C02/C3H8, 
was 1.0. At 873 K we measured only a low conversion 0.5-1.0% of propane. Propylene was 
produced with a selectivity of--90%. Similar measurements were performed on silica support, 
which exhibited even lower activity. 
Deposition of Mo2C on SiO2 caused a dramatic change in the catalytic performance and 
produced an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The main 
hydrocarbon products were propylene, ethylene and methane. In addition, butane, CO, 1-I20, 
H2 and very little benzene were found. The H20/H2 ratio varied between 10-15. The products 
distribution suggests that both the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation proceed, 
but the latter is the dominant process. After the initial decay, the conversion of propane 
remained constant for the applied measuring time, 4 hours. The reaction began at 773 K, 
when the steady state conversion was about 2.0%. With the increase of the temperature the 
conversion gradually increased and at 943 K it attained a value of 20.0%. The selectivity to 
propylene was very high, 85-90%, and was almost constant in the temperature range 773-873 
K. Further increase in the temperature caused a decrease in the selectivity to propylene, but an 
enhancement in the yield of propylene production. The selectivities of ethylene and methane 
gradually increased with the rise of the temperature. The effect of reaction temperature on the 
above features is displayed in Fig. 2A. 
Variation of the flow rate showed that the conversion of propane decreased with the rise of 
space velocity, but the rate of the formation of propylene slightly increased. As a result, the 
selectivity to propylene remained unchanged (Fig. 2B).

The effects of the CO2/C3H8 ratio on the rate and selectivities of several products were 
investigated at 873 K. The amount of propane was kept constant, 12.5%, and the amount of 
CO2 was varied. Comparison was made at 60 rain of reaction time. Results are presented in 
Fig. 3. The conversion of propane did not alter with the increase of the CO2 content, and fell 
in the range 7-10%. The propylene selectivity remained at a high level, --85%, and was 
practically independent of the CO2/C3I-Is ratio in the range of 0.5-4.0. In contrast, the rate of 
the formation of 1-12 and the H2/CO decreased, while the ratio of 1-120/I-12 increased with the 
increase of CO2 content suggesting that the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction became more 
dominant. 
In the interpretation of the results of catalytic measurements it appears clearly that CO2 
opened a new route for the formation of propylene. It is very likely that the first step in the 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 is the oxidation of Mo2C with CO2 and the 
formation of Mo oxycarbide. Further steps are practically the same as on the oxides. Propane 
may form a surface complex with the active oxygen of the carbide

3.4. Effects of supports 
Some experiments were also performed on the effects of supports. Qualitatively, we 
obtained similar results for Mo2C/AI203 arid Mo2C/Ti02. Basically different behavior was 
observed for Mo2C deposited on ZSM-5. On this catalyst, the main reaction pathway was the 
aromatization of propane. In the absence of CO2 at 873 K, the aromatic compounds (benzene 
and toluene) were produced with the highest selectivity, .-.45%, at a conversion level of 46%. 
This was followed by ethylene (12%), propylene (7%) and methane (26%). The presence of 
CO2 altered this product distribution, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane came into 
prominence. This is attributed to the partial oxidation of Mo2C.
