[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "For instance, h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials. (25) A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions."

[6] "Grant et al. (25) conducted kinetic experiments which revealed that the consumption rate of propane followed the partial order of PO2 and the second-order dependence to PC3H8, which was obviously different from the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism over supported VOx catalysts (zero order for O2 and first order for propane)."

[7] "To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Reaction mechanism: The 1-D edge active sites follow a different reaction mechanism compared to traditional catalysts. Kinetic experiments revealed that the consumption rate of propane followed a partial order for oxygen and second-order dependence on propane, which differs from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism observed in supported VOx catalysts.

2. Oxygen functionalization: Characterization techniques have shown that the BN sheets undergo oxygen functionalization when exposed to ODHP reaction conditions, which is crucial for their catalytic activity.

3. Performance improvement strategies: Understanding the importance of edge sites has led to strategies for improving catalyst performance, such as:
   a) Preoxygen modification of edge sites to reduce the induction period and improve ODHP performance.
   b) Increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio.
   c) Creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites.

4. Stability enhancement: Knowledge of the active sites has led to the development of composite catalysts like h-BN-In2O3, which show improved stability due to the strong metal oxide-support interaction.

By understanding these unique properties and mechanisms, researchers can design more efficient B-based catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and increased olefin productivity, making them more suitable for commercial ODHP applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可分为三类：一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D）分散活性位点。

一维活性位点，即线性分布在2-D h-BN片边缘的活性位点，在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。例如，具有1-D边缘活性位点的h-BN在14%的丙烷转化率下表现出79%的丙烯选择性，优于传统的V/SiO2等催化剂。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 反应机理：1-D边缘活性位点遵循与传统催化剂不同的反应机理。动力学实验表明，丙烷的消耗速率对氧气呈部分级数依赖，对丙烷呈二级依赖，这与负载型VOx催化剂上观察到的Mars-van Krevelen机理不同。

2. 氧功能化：表征技术表明，BN片在ODHP反应条件下会发生氧功能化，这对其催化活性至关重要。

3. 性能改进策略：理解边缘位点的重要性导致了多种改进催化剂性能的策略，如：
   a) 对边缘位点进行预氧化处理，以减少诱导期并提高ODHP性能。
   b) 通过减小BN纳米片的尺寸并增加边缘/表面比来增加边缘位点的密度。
   c) 创造一维形状的材料以增加活性位点数量。

4. 稳定性增强：对活性位点的了解促进了复合催化剂（如h-BN-In2O3）的开发，由于金属氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用，这些催化剂表现出更好的稳定性。

通过理解这些独特的性质和机理，研究人员可以设计出选择性更高、稳定性更好、烯烃产率更高的B基催化剂，使其更适合商业ODHP应用。
