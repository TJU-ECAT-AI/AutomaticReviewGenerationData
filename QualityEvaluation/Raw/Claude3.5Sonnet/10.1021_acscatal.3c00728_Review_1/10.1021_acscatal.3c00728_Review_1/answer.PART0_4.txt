[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."

[6] "DFT calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the OO bond created the BO and NO species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively."

[7] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

[8] "To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior selectivity towards olefins compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts. For instance, h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, while conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a lower propane conversion of 9%.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The reaction mechanism on 1-D edge active sites involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the second carbon of propane, followed by the cleavage of the O-O bond to create B-O and N-O species.

However, catalysts with 1-D active sites face challenges such as the need for an induction period, low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials, and stability issues. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed several performance promotion strategies, including preoxygen modification of edge sites, reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge/surface ratio, and creating 1-D shaped materials through methods like electrospinning.

By understanding and optimizing these aspects, researchers can design more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved commercial applications in the production of valuable olefins.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为三种类型：一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D）分散活性位点。

1-D活性位点线性分布在2-D h-BN片的边缘，与传统的金属氧化物催化剂相比，它们对烯烃表现出优越的选择性。例如，h-BN在14%的丙烷转化率下表现出79%的丙烯选择性，而传统的V/SiO2在较低的9%丙烷转化率下仅显示61%的丙烯选择性。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂做出了重大贡献。1-D边缘活性位点上的反应机理涉及从丙烷的第二个碳原子上提取氢，随后O-O键断裂形成B-O和N-O物种。

然而，具有1-D活性位点的催化剂面临一些挑战，如需要诱导期、2-D材料中边缘活性位点密度低，以及稳定性问题。为解决这些挑战，研究人员提出了几种性能促进策略，包括边缘位点的预氧化修饰、减小BN纳米片尺寸以增加边缘/表面比率，以及通过电纺等方法创造1-D形状的材料。

通过理解和优化这些方面，研究人员可以设计出更高效的B基ODHP反应催化剂，潜在地改进有价值烯烃生产的商业应用。
