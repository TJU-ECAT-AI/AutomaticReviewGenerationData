[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "Notably, the principal byproduct of the ODHP on the BN material was ethene (selectivity of 12%), also a valuable olefin, thus making the ODHP over BN atomically more efficient and profitable and resulting in the release of fewer carbon prints (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials. (25) A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions."

[6] "Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction (Figure 2b)."

[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

The 1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. These sites, particularly the oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<), are proposed as the primary active sites for the ODHP reaction. The zig-B edge has been found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, with propane dehydrogenation occurring more easily on oxygen-modified edge sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The superior selectivity towards olefins, particularly propene, and the production of valuable byproducts like ethene make the ODHP process over BN materials more efficient and profitable. Additionally, these catalysts result in fewer carbon emissions compared to conventional catalysts.

The oxygen functionalization of BN sheets under ODHP reaction conditions plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. This understanding has led to the development of various strategies to improve catalyst performance, such as preoxygen modification of edge sites, increasing the density of edge sites, and creating 1-D shaped materials through techniques like electrospinning.

By comprehending the behavior and mechanisms of these active sites, researchers can design catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and commercially viable processes for olefin production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为三种类型：一维(1-D)、二维(2-D)和三维(3-D)分散活性位点。

一维活性位点，即线性分布在二维h-BN片边缘的活性位点，在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。这些位点，特别是BN的含氧末端扶手边(>BOON<)，被认为是ODHP反应的主要活性位点。研究发现，锯齿形B边缘比扶手边或锯齿形N边缘更活跃，且在含氧修饰的边缘位点上，丙烷脱氢更容易发生。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，尤其是一维边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂贡献重大。BN材料在ODHP过程中对烯烃（特别是丙烯）的优异选择性，以及产生有价值的副产品如乙烯，使得这一过程更加高效和有利可图。此外，与传统催化剂相比，这些催化剂产生的碳排放更少。

BN片在ODHP反应条件下的含氧官能化对催化活性起着关键作用。这一认识促使研究人员开发了各种策略来提高催化剂性能，如边缘位点的预氧化修饰、增加边缘位点密度，以及通过电纺等技术创造一维形状的材料。

通过理解这些活性位点的行为和机理，研究人员可以设计出活性、选择性和稳定性更高的ODHP反应催化剂，有望为烯烃生产带来更高效和商业可行的工艺。
