[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."

[6] "DFT calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the OO bond created the BO and NO species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively."

[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."

[8] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior selectivity towards olefins compared to conventional metal oxide catalysts. For instance, h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, while conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a 9% conversion.

The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contribute to their high performance. DFT calculations revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by the cleavage of the O-O bond to create B-O and N-O species. The zig-B edge was found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, and propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to C-C bond cleavage side reactions.

Understanding these unique properties and mechanisms has led to the development of performance promotion strategies for 1-D BN edge active sites. These include pre-oxygen modification of edge sites, reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge/surface ratio, and aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials.

However, there are some challenges associated with 1-D active sites, such as the existence of an induction period, low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials, and stability issues. Addressing these challenges through various strategies, such as creating abundant 1-D edge active sites and improving catalyst stability, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可分为三类：一维(1-D)、二维(2-D)和三维(3-D)分散活性位点。

1-D活性位点线性分布在2-D h-BN片的边缘，与传统金属氧化物催化剂相比，对烯烃表现出优异的选择性。例如，h-BN在14%的丙烷转化率下表现出79%的丙烯选择性，而传统的V/SiO2在9%的转化率下仅显示61%的丙烯选择性。

1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理贡献了其高性能。DFT计算表明，反应始于从丙烷的第二个碳原子上抽取氢，随后O-O键断裂形成B-O和N-O物种。锯齿形B边缘比扶手椅形或锯齿形N边缘位点更活跃，且在氧修饰的边缘位点上丙烷脱氢比C-C键断裂副反应更容易发生。

理解这些独特性质和机理导致了1-D BN边缘活性位点性能提升策略的开发。这些策略包括边缘位点的预氧化修饰、减小BN纳米片尺寸以增加边缘/表面比例，以及将活性组分聚集成1-D形状的材料。

然而，1-D活性位点也存在一些挑战，如存在诱导期、2-D材料中边缘活性位点密度低，以及稳定性问题。通过各种策略解决这些挑战，如创造丰富的1-D边缘活性位点和提高催化剂稳定性，有助于设计出更高效的ODHP反应商业应用催化剂。
