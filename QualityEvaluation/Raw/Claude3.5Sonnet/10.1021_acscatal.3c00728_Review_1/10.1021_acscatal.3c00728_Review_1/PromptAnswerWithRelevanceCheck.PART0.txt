[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "Notably, the principal byproduct of the ODHP on the BN material was ethene (selectivity of 12%), also a valuable olefin, thus making the ODHP over BN atomically more efficient and profitable and resulting in the release of fewer carbon prints (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials. (25) A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions."

[6] "Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction (Figure 2b)."

[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

The 1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. These sites, particularly the oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<), are proposed as the primary active sites for the ODHP reaction. The zig-B edge has been found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, with propane dehydrogenation occurring more easily on oxygen-modified edge sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, especially the 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The superior selectivity towards olefins, particularly propene, and the production of valuable byproducts like ethene make the ODHP process over BN materials more efficient and profitable. Additionally, these catalysts result in fewer carbon emissions compared to conventional catalysts.

The oxygen functionalization of BN sheets under ODHP reaction conditions plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. This understanding has led to the development of various strategies to improve catalyst performance, such as preoxygen modification of edge sites, increasing the density of edge sites, and creating 1-D shaped materials through techniques like electrospinning.

By comprehending the behavior and mechanisms of these active sites, researchers can design catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and commercially viable processes for olefin production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为三种类型：一维(1-D)、二维(2-D)和三维(3-D)分散活性位点。

一维活性位点，即线性分布在二维h-BN片边缘的活性位点，在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。这些位点，特别是BN的含氧末端扶手边(>BOON<)，被认为是ODHP反应的主要活性位点。研究发现，锯齿形B边缘比扶手边或锯齿形N边缘更活跃，且在含氧修饰的边缘位点上，丙烷脱氢更容易发生。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，尤其是一维边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂贡献重大。BN材料在ODHP过程中对烯烃（特别是丙烯）的优异选择性，以及产生有价值的副产品如乙烯，使得这一过程更加高效和有利可图。此外，与传统催化剂相比，这些催化剂产生的碳排放更少。

BN片在ODHP反应条件下的含氧官能化对催化活性起着关键作用。这一认识促使研究人员开发了各种策略来提高催化剂性能，如边缘位点的预氧化修饰、增加边缘位点密度，以及通过电纺等技术创造一维形状的材料。

通过理解这些活性位点的行为和机理，研究人员可以设计出活性、选择性和稳定性更高的ODHP反应催化剂，有望为烯烃生产带来更高效和商业可行的工艺。

[5] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, h-BN materials with 1-D active sites face some challenges, including:

1. An induction period for the formation of real BO active sites
2. Low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials, limiting catalytic activity
3. Stability issues of 1-D B catalysts

To address these challenges and improve catalyst performance, researchers have proposed several strategies:

1. Preoxygen modification of edge sites to improve ODHP performance and reduce the induction period
2. Reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge/surface ratio and improve the density of edge sites
3. Aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials, such as nanofibers
4. Designing composite catalysts with improved stability, like h-BNxIn2O3

为了解决这些挑战并提高催化剂性能，研究人员提出了几种策略：

1. 对边缘位点进行预氧化处理，以提高ODHP性能并缩短诱导期

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Reaction mechanism: The 1-D edge active sites follow a different reaction mechanism compared to traditional catalysts. Kinetic experiments revealed that the consumption rate of propane followed a partial order for oxygen and second-order dependence on propane, which differs from the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism observed in supported VOx catalysts.

2. Oxygen functionalization: Characterization techniques have shown that the BN sheets undergo oxygen functionalization when exposed to ODHP reaction conditions, which is crucial for their catalytic activity.

3. Performance improvement strategies: Understanding the importance of edge sites has led to strategies for improving catalyst performance, such as:
   a) Preoxygen modification of edge sites to reduce the induction period and improve ODHP performance.
   b) Increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio.
   c) Creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites.

4. Stability enhancement: Knowledge of the active sites has led to the development of composite catalysts like h-BN-In2O3, which show improved stability due to the strong metal oxide-support interaction.

By understanding these unique properties and mechanisms, researchers can design more efficient B-based catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and increased olefin productivity, making them more suitable for commercial ODHP applications.

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 反应机理：1-D边缘活性位点遵循与传统催化剂不同的反应机理。动力学实验表明，丙烷的消耗速率对氧气呈部分级数依赖，对丙烷呈二级依赖，这与负载型VOx催化剂上观察到的Mars-van Krevelen机理不同。

2. 氧功能化：表征技术表明，BN片在ODHP反应条件下会发生氧功能化，这对其催化活性至关重要。

3. 性能改进策略：理解边缘位点的重要性导致了多种改进催化剂性能的策略，如：
   a) 对边缘位点进行预氧化处理，以减少诱导期并提高ODHP性能。
   b) 通过减小BN纳米片的尺寸并增加边缘/表面比来增加边缘位点的密度。
   c) 创造一维形状的材料以增加活性位点数量。

4. 稳定性增强：对活性位点的了解促进了复合催化剂（如h-BN-In2O3）的开发，由于金属氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用，这些催化剂表现出更好的稳定性。

通过理解这些独特的性质和机理，研究人员可以设计出选择性更高、稳定性更好、烯烃产率更高的B基催化剂，使其更适合商业ODHP应用。
