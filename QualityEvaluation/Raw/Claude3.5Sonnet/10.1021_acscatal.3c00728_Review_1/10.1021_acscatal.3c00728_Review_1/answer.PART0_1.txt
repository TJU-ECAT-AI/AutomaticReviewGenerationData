[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (5872)"

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions. (41,53,73) Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction"

[5] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

[6] "To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

The 1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have been extensively studied due to their superior selectivity towards olefins. These sites play a crucial role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. The oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<) are proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction, formed through oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets under reaction conditions.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, h-BN materials with 1-D active sites face some challenges, including:

1. An induction period for the formation of real BO active sites
2. Low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials, limiting catalytic activity
3. Stability issues of 1-D B catalysts

To address these challenges and improve catalyst performance, researchers have proposed several strategies:

1. Preoxygen modification of edge sites to improve ODHP performance and reduce the induction period
2. Reducing the size of BN nanosheets to increase the edge/surface ratio and improve the density of edge sites
3. Aggregating active components into 1-D shaped materials, such as nanofibers
4. Designing composite catalysts with improved stability, like h-BNxIn2O3

By understanding and optimizing these factors, researchers can develop more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved commercial applications in olefin production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为三类：一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D）分散活性位点。

一维活性位点线性分布在二维h-BN片的边缘，由于其对烯烃的优异选择性而被广泛研究。这些位点在表面和气相自由基反应中起着关键作用。BN的含氧末端扶手边（>BOON<）被提出作为ODHP反应的活性位点，它们是在反应条件下通过BN片的氧功能化形成的。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是一维边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂做出了重要贡献。然而，具有一维活性位点的h-BN材料面临一些挑战，包括：

1. 形成真正BO活性位点需要一个诱导期
2. 二维材料中边缘活性位点密度低，限制了催化活性
3. 一维B催化剂的稳定性问题

为了解决这些挑战并提高催化剂性能，研究人员提出了几种策略：

1. 对边缘位点进行预氧化处理，以提高ODHP性能并缩短诱导期
2. 减小BN纳米片的尺寸，增加边缘/表面比，提高边缘位点密度
3. 将活性组分聚集成一维形状的材料，如纳米纤维
4. 设计具有improved稳定性的复合催化剂，如h-BNxIn2O3

通过理解和优化这些因素，研究人员可以开发出更高效的B基ODHP反应催化剂，有可能为烯烃生产的商业应用带来改进。
