          [1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with a little CO2 (0.5%) at propane conversion of 20.6%."

[3] "On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[4] "It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP."

[5] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D distributions specifically, it highlights several important aspects:

1. Edge active sites (1-D): The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) showed high propylene selectivity, suggesting that 1-D edge sites can be highly effective for ODHP reactions.

2. Surface-distributed sites (2-D): B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface, indicating the importance of well-distributed 2-D active sites.

3. Structural considerations (3-D): The use of honeycomb cordierite structures with straight channels allows for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer, while thin wash-coated B2O3 layers facilitate pore diffusion, suggesting the importance of 3-D structural design in catalyst performance.

4. Anchoring mechanisms: The formation of B-O-Si bonds effectively anchored boron species, which likely contributes to better stability and distribution of active sites.

5. Active site nature: Tricoordinated BO species are proposed as the active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP, suggesting that the local coordination environment is crucial for catalytic activity.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to catalyst design by:

1. Emphasizing the importance of creating accessible edge sites or surface-distributed active centers.
2. Highlighting the need for proper anchoring mechanisms to stabilize active species.
3. Focusing on the creation and preservation of specific coordination environments (e.g., tricoordinated boron) that are conducive to ODHP reactions.
4. Considering 3-D structural design to optimize mass transfer and reactant accessibility.

These insights can guide the development of more efficient catalysts with optimized spatial distributions of active sites, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability for commercial ODHP applications.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。虽然文献没有详细介绍1-D、2-D和3-D分布的具体情况，但它强调了几个重要方面：

1. 边缘活性位点（1-D）：边缘羟基化的氮化硼（BNOH）表现出高丙烯选择性，表明1-D边缘位点对ODHP反应可能非常有效。

2. 表面分布的位点（2-D）：B2O3/SBA-15催化剂由于表面上丰富的三配位硼氧醇和羟基化线性硼物种而表现出更高的活性，说明了良好分布的2-D活性位点的重要性。

3. 结构考虑（3-D）：使用具有直通道的蜂窝状堇青石结构允许高气体时空速度（GHSV）和改善的传质效果，而薄层涂覆的B2O3层可以促进孔扩散，表明3-D结构设计在催化剂性能中的重要性。

4. 锚定机制：B-O-Si键的形成有效地锚定了硼物种，这可能有助于提高活性位点的稳定性和分布。

5. 活性位点性质：三配位BO物种被认为是硼基催化剂在ODHP中的活性位点，表明局部配位环境对催化活性至关重要。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于催化剂设计：

1. 强调创建可接近的边缘位点或表面分布的活性中心的重要性。
2. 突出了适当锚定机制的必要性，以稳定活性物种。
3. 关注创建和保持有利于ODHP反应的特定配位环境（如三配位硼）。
4. 考虑3-D结构设计以优化传质和反应物可及性。

这些见解可以指导开发具有优化活性位点空间分布的更高效催化剂，可能会提高商业ODHP应用的活性、选择性和稳定性。
