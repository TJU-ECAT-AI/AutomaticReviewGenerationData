[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[3] "It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP"

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about the nature of active sites in these catalysts.

The document mentions that boron-based metal-free catalysts have shown impressive activity and olefin selectivity in ODHP reactions. It specifically points out that tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species act as active sites in B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. The formation of B-O-Si bonds is also noted to effectively anchor the boron species.

The literature emphasizes the importance of tricoordinated BO species as active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP reactions. This suggests that the spatial configuration of these sites plays a crucial role in catalyst performance.

While the document does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites or their unique properties and reaction mechanisms, it does highlight the significance of understanding reaction mechanisms for designing more efficient catalysts. The preparation of B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst with improved catalytic activity is mentioned as an example of how this understanding can be applied.

Overall, the literature suggests that the nature and coordination of boron species are important factors in determining catalyst performance for ODHP reactions, but it does not provide specific information on how spatial distribution and dimensionality of these sites influence the reaction or contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在ODHP反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于这些催化剂中活性位点性质的相关信息。

文献提到，无金属的硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出令人印象深刻的活性和烯烃选择性。它特别指出，在B2O3/SBA-15催化剂中，三配位硼氧杂环和羟基化的线性硼物种作为活性位点。同时还注意到B-O-Si键的形成可以有效地固定硼物种。

文献强调了三配位BO物种作为硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中的活性位点的重要性。这表明这些位点的空间构型在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。

虽然文献没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点或其独特的性质和反应机理，但它确实强调了理解反应机理对设计更高效催化剂的重要性。文中提到制备具有更高催化活性的B2O3/SBA-15催化剂作为如何应用这种理解的例子。

总的来说，文献表明硼物种的性质和配位是决定ODHP反应催化剂性能的重要因素，但没有提供关于这些位点的空间分布和维度如何影响反应或如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂的具体信息。
