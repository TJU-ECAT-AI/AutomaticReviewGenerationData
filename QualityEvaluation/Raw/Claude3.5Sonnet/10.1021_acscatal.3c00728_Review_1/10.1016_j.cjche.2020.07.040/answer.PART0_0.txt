The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that 1-D edge active sites, such as those found in edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH), can efficiently catalyze ODHP with high propylene selectivity and low CO2 production. The understanding of these unique properties and reaction mechanisms has led to the development of more efficient catalysts like B2O3/SBA-15, which utilizes abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species as active sites.

The design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications has been further improved by incorporating these insights into novel structures, such as the honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst. This design takes advantage of the well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer effectively facilitates pore diffusion on the catalyst, leading to enhanced performance.

By understanding and optimizing the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, researchers have been able to create catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions. This approach has potential for further development and optimization of B-based catalysts for commercial applications in the production of propylene from propane.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，一维边缘活性位点（如在边缘羟基化的氮化硼(BNOH)中发现的）能够高效催化ODHP，具有高丙烯选择性和低CO2产量。对这些独特性质和反应机理的理解促进了更高效催化剂的开发，如B2O3/SBA-15，它利用丰富的三配位硼氧环和羟基化线性硼物种作为活性位点。

将这些见解应用于新型结构（如蜂窝状堇青石整体B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂）进一步改进了商业应用的高效催化剂设计。这种设计利用了蜂窝状堇青石的发达直通道结构，允许高气体时空速度(GHSV)和改善的传质效果。薄层涂覆的B2O3有效促进了催化剂上的孔扩散，从而提高了性能。

通过理解和优化活性位点的空间分布和维度，研究人员能够创造出ODHP反应的催化剂，具有更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。这种方法有潜力进一步开发和优化B基催化剂，用于丙烷制丙烯的商业应用。
