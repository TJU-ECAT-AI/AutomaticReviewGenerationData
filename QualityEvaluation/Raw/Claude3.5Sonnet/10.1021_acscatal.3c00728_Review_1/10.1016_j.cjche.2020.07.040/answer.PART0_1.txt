[1] "The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with a little CO2 (0.5%) at propane conversion of 20.6%."

[2] "B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[3] "It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP"

The literature does not directly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of active sites and their influence on catalyst performance.

The document mentions that edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzes ODHP, suggesting that edge sites play a crucial role in the reaction. This could be considered as an example of 1-D edge active sites.

For B2O3-based catalysts, the literature indicates that tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species act as active sites. The formation of B-O-Si bonds helps anchor these active species to the support. This suggests that the spatial distribution of these active sites on the support surface is important for catalyst performance.

The document emphasizes the importance of tricoordinated BO species as active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP. This highlights the significance of the local bonding environment and coordination of boron atoms in determining catalytic activity.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, it implies that optimizing the distribution and accessibility of these active sites could lead to improved catalyst performance. The development of the B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst with high propylene productivity demonstrates how catalyst design can be influenced by understanding the nature of active sites and optimizing their distribution on a suitable support.

文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于活性位点性质及其对催化剂性能影响的见解。

文献提到边缘羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)能有效催化ODHP，这表明边缘位点在反应中起着关键作用。这可以被视为一维边缘活性位点的一个例子。

对于B2O3基催化剂，文献指出三配位硼氧环和羟基化线性硼物种作为活性位点。B-O-Si键的形成有助于将这些活性物种锚定在载体上。这表明这些活性位点在载体表面的空间分布对催化剂性能很重要。

文献强调三配位BO物种作为硼基催化剂在ODHP中的活性位点的重要性。这突出了硼原子的局部键合环境和配位在决定催化活性方面的重要性。

虽然文献并未明确讨论理解这些特性如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，但它暗示了优化这些活性位点的分布和可及性可能会提高催化剂性能。B2O3/SiO2@HC整体催化剂的开发及其高丙烯生产力表明，催化剂设计可以通过理解活性位点的性质并在合适的载体上优化其分布来实现。
