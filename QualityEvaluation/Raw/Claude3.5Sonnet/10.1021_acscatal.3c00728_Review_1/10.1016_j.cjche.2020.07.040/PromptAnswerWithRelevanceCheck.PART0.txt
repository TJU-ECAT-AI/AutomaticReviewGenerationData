[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "In the previous work, we reported that the edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with a little CO2 (0.5%) at propane conversion of 20.6%."

[3] "On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[4] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that 1-D edge active sites, such as those found in edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH), can efficiently catalyze ODHP with high propylene selectivity and low CO2 production. The understanding of these unique properties and reaction mechanisms has led to the development of more efficient catalysts like B2O3/SBA-15, which utilizes abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species as active sites.

The design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications has been further improved by incorporating these insights into novel structures, such as the honeycomb cordierite monolithic B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst. This design takes advantage of the well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer effectively facilitates pore diffusion on the catalyst, leading to enhanced performance.

By understanding and optimizing the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, researchers have been able to create catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions. This approach has potential for further development and optimization of B-based catalysts for commercial applications in the production of propylene from propane.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，一维边缘活性位点（如在边缘羟基化的氮化硼(BNOH)中发现的）能够高效催化ODHP，具有高丙烯选择性和低CO2产量。对这些独特性质和反应机理的理解促进了更高效催化剂的开发，如B2O3/SBA-15，它利用丰富的三配位硼氧环和羟基化线性硼物种作为活性位点。

将这些见解应用于新型结构（如蜂窝状堇青石整体B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂）进一步改进了商业应用的高效催化剂设计。这种设计利用了蜂窝状堇青石的发达直通道结构，允许高气体时空速度(GHSV)和改善的传质效果。薄层涂覆的B2O3有效促进了催化剂上的孔扩散，从而提高了性能。

通过理解和优化活性位点的空间分布和维度，研究人员能够创造出ODHP反应的催化剂，具有更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。这种方法有潜力进一步开发和优化B基催化剂，用于丙烷制丙烯的商业应用。

The literature does not directly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of active sites and their influence on catalyst performance.

The document mentions that edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzes ODHP, suggesting that edge sites play a crucial role in the reaction. This could be considered as an example of 1-D edge active sites.

For B2O3-based catalysts, the literature indicates that tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species act as active sites. The formation of B-O-Si bonds helps anchor these active species to the support. This suggests that the spatial distribution of these active sites on the support surface is important for catalyst performance.

The document emphasizes the importance of tricoordinated BO species as active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP. This highlights the significance of the local bonding environment and coordination of boron atoms in determining catalytic activity.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, it implies that optimizing the distribution and accessibility of these active sites could lead to improved catalyst performance. The development of the B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst with high propylene productivity demonstrates how catalyst design can be influenced by understanding the nature of active sites and optimizing their distribution on a suitable support.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature doesn't provide extensive details on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D distributions specifically, but it does highlight some important aspects:

1. Edge active sites: The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) showed high propylene selectivity, suggesting that 1-D edge sites can be effective for ODHP reactions.

2. Surface-distributed sites: B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface, indicating the importance of well-distributed 2-D active sites.

3. Anchoring mechanisms: The formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored boron species, which likely contributes to better stability and distribution of active sites.

4. Active site nature: Tricoordinated BO species are proposed as the active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP, suggesting that the local coordination environment is crucial for catalytic activity.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to catalyst design by:

1. Emphasizing the importance of creating accessible edge sites or surface-distributed active centers.
2. Highlighting the need for proper anchoring mechanisms to stabilize active species.
3. Focusing on the creation and preservation of specific coordination environments (e.g., tricoordinated boron) that are conducive to ODHP reactions.

These insights can guide the development of more efficient catalysts with optimized spatial distributions of active sites, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability for commercial ODHP applications.

2. 表面分布的位点：B2O3/SBA-15催化剂由于表面上丰富的三配位硼氧醇和羟基化线性硼物种而表现出更高的活性，说明了良好分布的2-D活性位点的重要性。

3. 锚定机制：BOSi键的形成有效地锚定了硼物种，这可能有助于提高活性位点的稳定性和分布。

4. 活性位点性质：三配位BO物种被认为是硼基催化剂在ODHP中的活性位点，表明局部配位环境对催化活性至关重要。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于催化剂设计：

1. 强调创建可接近的边缘位点或表面分布的活性中心的重要性。
2. 突出了适当锚定机制的必要性，以稳定活性物种。
3. 关注创建和保持有利于ODHP反应的特定配位环境（如三配位硼）。

这些见解可以指导开发具有优化活性位点空间分布的更高效催化剂，可能会提高商业ODHP应用的活性、选择性和稳定性。
