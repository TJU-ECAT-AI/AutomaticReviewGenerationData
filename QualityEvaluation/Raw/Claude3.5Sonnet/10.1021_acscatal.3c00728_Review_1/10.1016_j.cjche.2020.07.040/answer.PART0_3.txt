[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[3] "It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP"

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide some relevant information about the nature of active sites in these catalysts.

The document mentions that boron-based metal-free catalysts have shown impressive activity and olefin selectivity in ODHP reactions. It specifically notes that tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species act as active sites in B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. The formation of B-O-Si bonds is also mentioned as important for anchoring boron species to the support.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites or compare different dimensionalities, it does emphasize the importance of tricoordinated boron species as active sites for ODHP. This suggests that understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these specific sites is crucial for catalyst design.

The document does not provide information on how this understanding contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, it implies that optimizing the distribution and accessibility of these tricoordinated boron species could be a key factor in improving catalyst performance for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。但是，它确实提供了一些关于这些催化剂中活性位点性质的相关信息。

文档提到，无金属的硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出令人印象深刻的活性和烯烃选择性。它特别指出，三配位硼氧化物和羟基化线性硼物种在B2O3/SBA-15催化剂中充当活性位点。B-O-Si键的形成也被提及，对于将硼物种锚定到支持物上很重要。

虽然文献没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点或比较不同的维度，但它确实强调了三配位硼物种作为ODHP活性位点的重要性。这表明，理解这些特定位点的独特性质和反应机理对催化剂设计至关重要。

文档没有提供关于这种理解如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂的信息。然而，它暗示优化这些三配位硼物种的分布和可及性可能是改善ODHP反应催化剂性能的关键因素。
