[1] "CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

[2] "These basal plane edges are usually saturated with oxygenated surface groups, which are reported to be the active phase in ODH. The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

[3] "As blank tests with B2O3 showed no activity, the increase of conversion with B doping could be explained because of the increase in surface area and the creation of new oxygenated surface groups upon thermal treatment of the boric acid precursor as demonstrated by the increase of the O/C ratio determined by XPS"

[4] "The highest selectivity to propene (>70%) was achieved with 1.5%PTPP-CNF."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The carbon nanofibers (CNFs) used as catalyst supports expose basal plane edges, which provide a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface. These edge sites are typically saturated with oxygenated surface groups that act as the active phase in ODH reactions.

The 1-D edge active sites in B-doped CNFs play a crucial role in catalyst performance. Boron doping increases the surface area and creates new oxygenated surface groups, which enhances catalytic activity. The selective sites for propene formation are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Optimizing dopant distribution: By controlling the spatial distribution of boron on the CNF surface, catalysts can be designed to maximize the number of selective active sites while minimizing unselective ones.

2. Tuning surface chemistry: The type and density of oxygenated surface groups can be tailored through careful selection of dopants and precursors, as demonstrated by the high selectivity achieved with triphenylphosphine-doped CNFs.

3. Enhancing accessibility: The exposed edge sites of CNFs provide excellent accessibility to reactants, which can be further improved by optimizing the catalyst's morphology and pore structure.

4. Balancing activity and selectivity: Understanding the role of different active sites allows for the development of catalysts that strike an optimal balance between conversion and selectivity, which is crucial for commercial viability.

5. Improving stability: Knowledge of the active site properties can guide the design of catalysts with enhanced thermal and chemical stability, addressing long-term performance issues in industrial applications.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved yields, selectivities, and overall process economics in commercial applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。作为催化剂载体的碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露出基面边缘，在外表面提供了高密度的可接触缺陷位点。这些边缘位点通常被含氧表面基团饱和，这些基团在ODH反应中充当活性相。

B掺杂CNFs中的一维边缘活性位点在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。硼掺杂增加了表面积并创造了新的含氧表面基团，从而增强了催化活性。据报道，碳表面的醌或二羰基是丙烯形成的选择性位点，而羧酸则不具选择性并促进完全氧化。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 优化掺杂剂分布：通过控制硼在CNF表面的空间分布，可以设计出最大化选择性活性位点数量同时最小化非选择性位点的催化剂。

2. 调节表面化学性质：可以通过仔细选择掺杂剂和前驱体来调整含氧表面基团的类型和密度，正如三苯基膦掺杂CNFs所展示的高选择性那样。

3. 提高可及性：CNFs的暴露边缘位点为反应物提供了极佳的可及性，可以通过优化催化剂的形态和孔结构进一步改善。

4. 平衡活性和选择性：了解不同活性位点的作用有助于开发在转化率和选择性之间取得最佳平衡的催化剂，这对商业可行性至关重要。

5. 提高稳定性：了解活性位点的性质可以指导设计具有增强热稳定性和化学稳定性的催化剂，解决工业应用中的长期性能问题。

利用这些见解，研究人员可以开发出更高效的ODHP反应B基催化剂，有望在商业应用中提高产率、选择性和整体工艺经济性。
