[1] "Unlike CNTs, which expose graphitic planes to the gas reactants, CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

[2] "The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

[3] "For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied."

[4] "A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

[5] "The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. 

1D edge active sites: CNFs expose basal plane edges, providing a higher density of accessible defect sites for reactants. These edge sites are crucial for the catalytic activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions.

2D surface sites: The selective sites for ODHP are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface. These surface-bound functional groups play a key role in the reaction mechanism.

3D clustered sites: At higher calcination temperatures, B2O3 clusters can form on the CNF surface. These 3D structures can potentially block active sites and affect catalyst performance.

The unique properties of 1D edge active sites contribute significantly to catalyst design:

1. Higher accessibility: Edge sites are more accessible to reactants, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

2. Tunability: The nature of edge sites can be modified by varying boron loading and calcination temperature, allowing for optimization of catalyst performance.

3. Selective functionalization: Edge sites can be selectively functionalized with boron species, such as B linked to three O atoms or (BO3)n chains, which can enhance selectivity towards propene.

Understanding these different types of active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the distribution and nature of 1D edge sites, 2D surface functional groups, and controlling the formation of 3D clusters, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for large-scale propene production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。

一维边缘活性位点：碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露基面边缘，为反应物提供了更高密度的可接近缺陷位点。这些边缘位点对ODHP反应的催化活性和选择性至关重要。

二维表面位点：ODHP的选择性位点据报道是碳表面的醌或二羰基团。这些表面结合的官能团在反应机理中起关键作用。

三维聚集位点：在较高的煅烧温度下，B2O3簇可以在CNF表面形成。这些三维结构可能会阻塞活性位点并影响催化剂性能。

一维边缘活性位点的独特性质对催化剂设计有重要贡献：

1. 更高的可及性：边缘位点更容易被反应物接近，可能增加催化活性。

2. 可调性：通过改变硼负载量和煅烧温度，可以修改边缘位点的性质，从而优化催化剂性能。

3. 选择性功能化：边缘位点可以选择性地与硼物种（如与三个氧原子相连的硼或(BO3)n链）功能化，这可以提高对丙烯的选择性。

理解这些不同类型的活性位点及其反应机理对于设计更高效的商业ODHP催化剂至关重要。通过优化一维边缘位点的分布和性质、二维表面官能团，以及控制三维簇的形成，研究人员可能开发出活性、选择性和稳定性更好的催化剂，用于大规模丙烯生产。
