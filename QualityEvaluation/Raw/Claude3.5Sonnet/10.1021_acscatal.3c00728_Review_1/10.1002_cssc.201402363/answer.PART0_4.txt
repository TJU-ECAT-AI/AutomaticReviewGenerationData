[1] "CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

[2] "The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

[3] "A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

[4] "The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) used as catalyst supports expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface. These edge sites are crucial for reactant accessibility and catalytic activity.

The 1-D edge active sites in B-doped CNFs play a pivotal role in the ODHP reaction. The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these edge sites, creating new active centers.

B-doping creates different types of active sites depending on the calcination temperature and boron loading. At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron predominantly forms B-O-C structures, with boron linked to three oxygen atoms or forming (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. These 1-D structures along the edges of the CNFs contribute to the selective dehydrogenation of propane.

At higher calcination temperatures (973K), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface. These 3-D structures can block some active sites, potentially reducing overall activity but possibly enhancing selectivity by deactivating unselective sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The balance between different types of boron species (1-D B-O-C structures vs. 3-D B2O3 clusters) can be tuned by controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading. This knowledge allows for the optimization of catalyst performance by maximizing the density of selective sites while minimizing the formation of unselective or blocking structures.

For commercial applications, this understanding can guide the development of catalysts with improved propene yield and selectivity. By carefully controlling the spatial distribution of boron species and leveraging the high accessibility of edge sites in CNFs, it may be possible to create catalysts that outperform traditional metal oxide-based systems in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。作为催化剂载体的碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露出基面边缘，在外表面提供了高密度的可接触缺陷位点。这些边缘位点对反应物的可及性和催化活性至关重要。

B掺杂CNFs中的一维边缘活性位点在ODHP反应中起着关键作用。报道显示，选择性位点是碳表面的醌或二羰基团，而羧酸基团则不具选择性并促进完全氧化。硼的引入修饰了这些边缘位点，创造了新的活性中心。

B掺杂根据煅烧温度和硼负载量的不同会创造不同类型的活性位点。在较低温度(673-773K)下，硼主要形成B-O-C结构，硼与三个氧原子相连或形成与石墨晶格锯齿面相连的(BO3)n链。这些沿CNFs边缘的一维结构有助于丙烷的选择性脱氢。

在较高的煅烧温度(973K)下，B2O3簇在CNF表面形成。这些三维结构可能会阻塞一些活性位点，潜在地降低整体活性，但可能通过使非选择性位点失活而增强选择性。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是一维边缘活性位点，对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。通过控制煅烧温度和硼负载量，可以调节不同类型硼物种(一维B-O-C结构与三维B2O3簇)之间的平衡。这些知识允许通过最大化选择性位点的密度并最小化非选择性或阻塞结构的形成来优化催化剂性能。

对于商业应用，这种理解可以指导开发具有改进的丙烯产率和选择性的催化剂。通过仔细控制硼物种的空间分布并利用CNFs中边缘位点的高可及性，可能创造出在活性、选择性和稳定性方面优于传统金属氧化物基系统的催化剂。
