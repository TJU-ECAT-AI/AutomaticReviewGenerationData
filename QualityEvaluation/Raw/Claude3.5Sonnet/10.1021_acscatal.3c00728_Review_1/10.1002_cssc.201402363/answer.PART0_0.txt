[1] "CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

[2] "The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

[3] "A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

[4] "The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of defects on the outer surface that are easily accessible to reactants. This 1-D edge structure contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon-based catalysts are primarily oxygenated surface groups. Selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these sites and their distribution.

Boron doping creates different types of active sites depending on the calcination temperature. At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron is predominantly linked to three oxygen atoms, forming isolated BO3 units or (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. This creates a 1-D distribution of active sites along the edges of the CNFs.

As calcination temperature increases (973K), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface, creating a more 3-D distribution of active sites. This change in spatial distribution and dimensionality affects the catalyst's performance, with the 1-D edge sites generally providing better selectivity towards propene.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading, it's possible to optimize the distribution of active sites, maximizing selectivity towards propene while maintaining high conversion rates. This knowledge allows for the development of catalysts with improved performance and stability, potentially bringing ODHP processes closer to commercial viability.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露基底平面边缘，在外表面提供高密度的缺陷，这些缺陷容易被反应物接触。这种一维边缘结构有助于催化剂的有效性。

碳基催化剂上ODHP反应的活性位点主要是含氧表面基团。选择性位点被报道为醌或二羰基团，而羧酸基团不具选择性并促进完全氧化。引入硼修饰了这些位点及其分布。

硼掺杂根据煅烧温度创造不同类型的活性位点。在较低温度(673-773K)下，硼主要与三个氧原子相连，形成孤立的BO3单元或与石墨晶格之字形面键合的(BO3)n链。这在CNFs边缘创造了一维分布的活性位点。

随着煅烧温度升高(973K)，B2O3簇在CNF表面形成，创造了更多三维分布的活性位点。这种空间分布和维度的变化影响了催化剂的性能，一维边缘位点通常提供更好的丙烯选择性。

理解这些独特的一维边缘活性位点的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。通过控制煅烧温度和硼负载量，可以优化活性位点的分布，在保持高转化率的同时最大化丙烯选择性。这些知识允许开发性能和稳定性更好的催化剂，有可能使ODHP过程更接近商业可行性。
