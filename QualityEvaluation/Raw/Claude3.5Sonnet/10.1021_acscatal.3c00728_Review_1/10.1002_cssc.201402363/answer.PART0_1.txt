[1] "Unlike CNTs, which expose graphitic planes to the gas reactants, CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

[2] "The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

[3] "B-CNF samples seem to be stable in air until approximately 873K. The residue after carbon gasification increases slightly as the B content in the CNFs increases, presumably because of residual boron oxide."

[4] "As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

[5] "A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a higher density of defects on the outer surface that are accessible to reactants. This 1-D edge structure contributes to the unique properties of B-based CNF catalysts.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon surfaces are primarily quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. When B is introduced to CNFs, it interacts with these surface groups, modifying their reactivity and selectivity.

As the calcination temperature increases, new B species develop on the CNF surface. At lower temperatures (673-773K), B is predominantly linked to three O atoms or forms (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. This 1-D distribution of B along the CNF edges likely contributes to the catalyst's performance by modifying the electronic properties of nearby carbon atoms and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Understanding these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The unique spatial distribution of B species along the CNF edges allows for tuning of the catalyst's selectivity and activity. By controlling the calcination temperature and B content, it's possible to optimize the distribution and nature of active sites for improved ODHP performance.

The stability of B-CNF catalysts up to 873K in air suggests that these 1-D edge structures maintain their integrity under reaction conditions, which is important for commercial applications. However, at higher temperatures, the formation of boron oxide residues may affect the catalyst's long-term performance.

In summary, the 1-D edge active sites in B-based CNF catalysts offer a unique platform for tuning ODHP reactions. By understanding and controlling the spatial distribution of B species along these edges, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for commercial ODHP processes.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露出基底平面边缘，在外表面提供了更高密度的缺陷，这些缺陷易于被反应物接触。这种一维边缘结构构成了B基CNF催化剂的独特性质。

ODHP反应在碳表面的活性位点主要是醌或双羰基基团，而羧酸基团则不具选择性并促进完全氧化。当B引入CNFs时，它与这些表面基团相互作用，改变了它们的反应性和选择性。

随着煅烧温度的升高，CNF表面会形成新的B物种。在较低温度(673-773K)下，B主要与三个O原子相连，或形成与石墨晶格锯齿形边缘相连的(BO3)n链。这种B沿CNF边缘的一维分布可能通过改变附近碳原子和含氧官能团的电子性质来影响催化剂的性能。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。B物种沿CNF边缘的独特空间分布允许调节催化剂的选择性和活性。通过控制煅烧温度和B含量，可以优化活性位点的分布和性质，以提高ODHP性能。

B-CNF催化剂在空气中873K以下的稳定性表明，这些一维边缘结构在反应条件下保持完整，这对商业应用很重要。然而，在更高温度下，氧化硼残留物的形成可能影响催化剂的长期性能。

总之，B基CNF催化剂中的一维边缘活性位点为调节ODHP反应提供了独特的平台。通过理解和控制B物种沿这些边缘的空间分布，研究人员可以开发出更高效、更具选择性的商业ODHP过程催化剂。
