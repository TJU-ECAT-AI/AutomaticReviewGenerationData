The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of defects on the outer surface that are easily accessible to reactants. This 1-D edge structure contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon-based catalysts are primarily oxygenated surface groups. Selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these sites and their distribution.

Boron doping creates different types of active sites depending on the calcination temperature. At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron is predominantly linked to three oxygen atoms, forming isolated BO3 units or (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. This creates a 1-D distribution of active sites along the edges of the CNFs.

As calcination temperature increases (973K), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface, creating a more 3-D distribution of active sites. This change in spatial distribution and dimensionality affects the catalyst's performance, with the 1-D edge sites generally providing better selectivity towards propene.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading, it's possible to optimize the distribution of active sites, maximizing selectivity towards propene while maintaining high conversion rates. This knowledge allows for the development of catalysts with improved performance and stability, potentially bringing ODHP processes closer to commercial viability.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a higher density of defects on the outer surface that are accessible to reactants. This 1-D edge structure contributes to the unique properties of B-based CNF catalysts.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon surfaces are primarily quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. When B is introduced to CNFs, it interacts with these surface groups, modifying their reactivity and selectivity.

As the calcination temperature increases, new B species develop on the CNF surface. At lower temperatures (673-773K), B is predominantly linked to three O atoms or forms (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. This 1-D distribution of B along the CNF edges likely contributes to the catalyst's performance by modifying the electronic properties of nearby carbon atoms and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Understanding these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The unique spatial distribution of B species along the CNF edges allows for tuning of the catalyst's selectivity and activity. By controlling the calcination temperature and B content, it's possible to optimize the distribution and nature of active sites for improved ODHP performance.

The stability of B-CNF catalysts up to 873K in air suggests that these 1-D edge structures maintain their integrity under reaction conditions, which is important for commercial applications. However, at higher temperatures, the formation of boron oxide residues may affect the catalyst's long-term performance.

In summary, the 1-D edge active sites in B-based CNF catalysts offer a unique platform for tuning ODHP reactions. By understanding and controlling the spatial distribution of B species along these edges, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for commercial ODHP processes.

理解这些一维边缘活性位点对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。B物种沿CNF边缘的独特空间分布允许调节催化剂的选择性和活性。通过控制煅烧温度和B含量，可以优化活性位点的分布和性质，以提高ODHP性能。

B-CNF催化剂在空气中873K以下的稳定性表明，这些一维边缘结构在反应条件下保持完整，这对商业应用很重要。然而，在更高温度下，氧化硼残留物的形成可能影响催化剂的长期性能。

总之，B基CNF催化剂中的一维边缘活性位点为调节ODHP反应提供了独特的平台。通过理解和控制B物种沿这些边缘的空间分布，研究人员可以开发出更高效、更具选择性的商业ODHP过程催化剂。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. 

1D edge active sites: CNFs expose basal plane edges, providing a higher density of accessible defect sites for reactants. These edge sites are crucial for the catalytic activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions.

2D surface sites: The selective sites for ODHP are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface. These surface-bound functional groups play a key role in the reaction mechanism.

3D clustered sites: At higher calcination temperatures, B2O3 clusters can form on the CNF surface. These 3D structures can potentially block active sites and affect catalyst performance.

The unique properties of 1D edge active sites contribute significantly to catalyst design:

1. Higher accessibility: Edge sites are more accessible to reactants, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

2. Tunability: The nature of edge sites can be modified by varying boron loading and calcination temperature, allowing for optimization of catalyst performance.

3. Selective functionalization: Edge sites can be selectively functionalized with boron species, such as B linked to three O atoms or (BO3)n chains, which can enhance selectivity towards propene.

Understanding these different types of active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the distribution and nature of 1D edge sites, 2D surface functional groups, and controlling the formation of 3D clusters, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for large-scale propene production.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The carbon nanofibers (CNFs) used as catalyst supports expose basal plane edges, which provide a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface. These edge sites are typically saturated with oxygenated surface groups that act as the active phase in ODH reactions.

The 1-D edge active sites in B-doped CNFs play a crucial role in catalyst performance. Boron doping increases the surface area and creates new oxygenated surface groups, which enhances catalytic activity. The selective sites for propene formation are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Optimizing dopant distribution: By controlling the spatial distribution of boron on the CNF surface, catalysts can be designed to maximize the number of selective active sites while minimizing unselective ones.

2. Tuning surface chemistry: The type and density of oxygenated surface groups can be tailored through careful selection of dopants and precursors, as demonstrated by the high selectivity achieved with triphenylphosphine-doped CNFs.

3. Enhancing accessibility: The exposed edge sites of CNFs provide excellent accessibility to reactants, which can be further improved by optimizing the catalyst's morphology and pore structure.

4. Balancing activity and selectivity: Understanding the role of different active sites allows for the development of catalysts that strike an optimal balance between conversion and selectivity, which is crucial for commercial viability.

5. Improving stability: Knowledge of the active site properties can guide the design of catalysts with enhanced thermal and chemical stability, addressing long-term performance issues in industrial applications.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to improved yields, selectivities, and overall process economics in commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) used as catalyst supports expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface. These edge sites are crucial for reactant accessibility and catalytic activity.

The 1-D edge active sites in B-doped CNFs play a pivotal role in the ODHP reaction. The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these edge sites, creating new active centers.

B-doping creates different types of active sites depending on the calcination temperature and boron loading. At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron predominantly forms B-O-C structures, with boron linked to three oxygen atoms or forming (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. These 1-D structures along the edges of the CNFs contribute to the selective dehydrogenation of propane.

At higher calcination temperatures (973K), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface. These 3-D structures can block some active sites, potentially reducing overall activity but possibly enhancing selectivity by deactivating unselective sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The balance between different types of boron species (1-D B-O-C structures vs. 3-D B2O3 clusters) can be tuned by controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading. This knowledge allows for the optimization of catalyst performance by maximizing the density of selective sites while minimizing the formation of unselective or blocking structures.

For commercial applications, this understanding can guide the development of catalysts with improved propene yield and selectivity. By carefully controlling the spatial distribution of boron species and leveraging the high accessibility of edge sites in CNFs, it may be possible to create catalysts that outperform traditional metal oxide-based systems in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.
