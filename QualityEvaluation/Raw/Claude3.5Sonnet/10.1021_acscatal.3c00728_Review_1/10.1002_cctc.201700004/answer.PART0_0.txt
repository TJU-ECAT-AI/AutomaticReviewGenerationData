The literature provides insights into how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, particularly focusing on 1-D edge active sites.

The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst demonstrates superior performance in ODHP reactions, with high selectivity towards propylene (80.2%) and minimal CO2 formation (0.5%). This performance is attributed to the unique properties of the 1-D edge active sites, specifically the BOH groups located at the edges of the boron nitride structure.

The creation of these edge sites is achieved through steam activation, which generates a large number of edges while maintaining the hexagonal symmetry of the in-plane lattice. This process results in a catalyst with a high concentration of 1-D active sites, which are crucial for the selective activation of C-H bonds in propane.

The reaction mechanism involves the dynamic generation of active BNO. sites through hydrogen abstraction from BOH groups by molecular oxygen. These sites selectively break the C-H bond in propane while simultaneously preventing the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. This selective activation is a key factor in the catalyst's high performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By focusing on the creation and optimization of these edge sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with even higher selectivity and efficiency for ODHP reactions.

The study demonstrates that the spatial distribution of active sites, particularly the concentration of edge sites, plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. This insight can guide future catalyst design, emphasizing the importance of maximizing the number of accessible edge sites while maintaining the overall structural integrity of the catalyst.

In conclusion, the research on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalysts highlights the significance of 1-D edge active sites in improving ODHP reactions. By understanding and exploiting these unique properties, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and selective catalysts for commercial applications in the production of propylene.

该文献提供了关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的见解，特别关注了一维边缘活性位点。

边缘羟基化的氮化硼催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能，对丙烯具有高选择性（80.2%）和最小的CO2形成（0.5%）。这种性能归因于一维边缘活性位点的独特属性，特别是位于氮化硼结构边缘的BOH基团。

这些边缘位点的创建是通过蒸汽活化实现的，这种方法在保持平面内晶格六方对称性的同时生成了大量的边缘。这个过程产生了具有高浓度一维活性位点的催化剂，这些位点对丙烷中C-H键的选择性活化至关重要。

反应机理涉及通过分子氧从BOH基团中提取氢而动态生成活性BNO.位点。这些位点选择性地断裂丙烷中的C-H键，同时防止丙烯过度氧化为CO2。这种选择性活化是催化剂高性能的关键因素。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂有重大贡献。通过关注这些边缘位点的创建和优化，研究人员可能开发出具有更高选择性和效率的ODHP反应催化剂。

该研究表明，活性位点的空间分布，特别是边缘位点的浓度，在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。这一见解可以指导未来的催化剂设计，强调在保持催化剂整体结构完整性的同时最大化可访问边缘位点数量的重要性。

总之，对边缘羟基化氮化硼催化剂的研究强调了一维边缘活性位点在改善ODHP反应中的重要性。通过理解和利用这些独特的属性，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效、更具选择性的商业应用催化剂，用于丙烯的生产。
