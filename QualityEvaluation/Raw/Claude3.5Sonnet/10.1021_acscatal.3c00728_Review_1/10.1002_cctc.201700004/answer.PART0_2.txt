[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "TEM images viewed along the [001] direction (Figure2a and FigureS6) revealed that the most frequently exposed lateral termination facets were {10 0}, {01 0}, and {1 00}, suggesting that the terminated configuration had zigzag edges."

[4] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[5] "Upon exposure to C3H8 atmosphere at 530C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged, and no propane conversion was detected (Figure3a). With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened (Figure3a), accompanied with the formation of propylene, indicating that the OH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction network."

The literature provides insights into how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, particularly focusing on the 1-D edge active sites.

The BNOH catalyst was prepared by steam activation, which created a large number of edges on the hexagonal boron nitride lattice. These edges, characterized by zigzag terminations, are the primary locations of the active sites. The active sites are specifically identified as BOH groups at the edges of the boron nitride structure.

The 1-D nature of these edge sites is crucial for the catalyst's performance. The boron atoms at the edges are bonded to oxygen, forming BOH groups, which are distinct from the boron atoms coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface. This spatial distribution of active sites along the edges provides accessibility for reactants and allows for selective activation of CH bonds in propane.

The reaction mechanism involving these 1-D edge sites is elucidated through in-situ FTIR studies. The BOH groups at the edges interact with molecular oxygen, leading to the weakening of hydroxyl vibrations and the formation of propylene. This suggests that the edge sites play a critical role in activating both the propane molecule and oxygen, facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of the 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By focusing on creating and optimizing these edge sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with higher selectivity and activity for ODHP reactions. The spatial distribution of active sites along the edges allows for better control of the reaction pathway, potentially minimizing unwanted side reactions and improving overall catalyst performance.

This research demonstrates the importance of tailoring the dimensionality and spatial distribution of active sites in catalyst design, particularly for ODHP reactions. By leveraging the unique properties of 1-D edge sites in boron-based catalysts, it may be possible to overcome limitations of traditional metal-based catalysts and develop more efficient and selective catalytic systems for commercial ODHP processes.

该文献提供了关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的见解，特别关注了一维边缘活性位点。

BNOH催化剂通过蒸汽活化制备，在六方氮化硼晶格上创造了大量边缘。这些边缘以之字形终端为特征，是活性位点的主要位置。活性位点被明确识别为氮化硼结构边缘的BOH基团。

这些边缘位点的一维性质对催化剂的性能至关重要。边缘处的硼原子与氧结合，形成BOH基团，这与平面表面上与氮配位的硼原子不同。这种沿边缘的活性位点空间分布为反应物提供了可及性，并允许选择性地活化丙烷中的CH键。

通过原位FTIR研究阐明了涉及这些一维边缘位点的反应机理。边缘处的BOH基团与分子氧相互作用，导致羟基振动减弱和丙烯的形成。这表明边缘位点在活化丙烷分子和氧气方面起着关键作用，促进了脱氢反应。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂做出了重大贡献。通过专注于创建和优化这些边缘位点，研究人员可能开发出具有更高选择性和活性的ODHP反应催化剂。沿边缘的活性位点空间分布允许更好地控制反应路径，可能最大限度地减少不需要的副反应并提高整体催化剂性能。

这项研究表明了在催化剂设计中调整活性位点的维度和空间分布的重要性，特别是对于ODHP反应。通过利用硼基催化剂中一维边缘位点的独特性质，可能克服传统金属基催化剂的局限性，并为商业ODHP过程开发更高效和选择性的催化系统。
