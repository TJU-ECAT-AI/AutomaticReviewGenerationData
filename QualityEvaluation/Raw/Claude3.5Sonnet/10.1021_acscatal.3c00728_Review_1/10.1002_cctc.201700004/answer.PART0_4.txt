The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature describes a catalyst where the active sites are primarily located at the edges of boron nitride sheets, creating a 1-D distribution of active sites.

These edge sites, particularly the BOH groups, play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance. The steam activation process creates a large number of edges with zigzag configurations, increasing the number of potential active sites. The boron species at these edges bond with oxygen, forming BOH groups that are key to the catalyst's activity.

The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the catalyst's high selectivity and efficiency. The BOH groups at the edges interact with molecular oxygen, creating dynamic active sites that selectively trigger propane dehydrogenation. This mechanism allows for efficient propane conversion while minimizing unwanted CO2 production.

Understanding these 1-D edge active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By focusing on enhancing the formation and properties of these edge sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved selectivity, stability, and efficiency for ODHP reactions. This approach offers a promising direction for creating metal-free catalysts that can outperform traditional metal-based systems in terms of both activity and selectivity.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。文献描述了一种催化剂，其活性位点主要位于氮化硼片的边缘，形成一维分布的活性位点。

这些边缘位点，特别是BOH基团，在催化剂的性能中起着至关重要的作用。蒸汽活化过程创造了大量具有锯齿形构型的边缘，增加了潜在活性位点的数量。这些边缘的硼物种与氧结合，形成对催化剂活性至关重要的BOH基团。

这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质有助于催化剂的高选择性和效率。边缘的BOH基团与分子氧相互作用，创造动态活性位点，选择性地触发丙烷脱氢。这种机制允许高效的丙烷转化，同时最大限度地减少不需要的CO2产生。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点及其反应机制对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂至关重要。通过专注于增强这些边缘位点的形成和性质，研究人员可以潜在地开发出具有改进的选择性、稳定性和效率的ODHP反应催化剂。这种方法为创造在活性和选择性方面都能超越传统金属基系统的无金属催化剂提供了一个有前景的方向。
