The literature provides insights into how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, particularly focusing on the 1-D edge active sites.

The catalyst structure consists of a 2-D hexagonal lattice with newly created edges during steam activation. These edges, specifically the zigzag edges, serve as the primary 1-D active sites for the ODHP reaction. The spatial distribution of active sites is characterized by two types of boron species: one coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface (2-D) and another bonded to oxygen at the edges (1-D).

The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute significantly to the catalyst's performance. The BOH groups at the edges play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Molecular oxygen abstracts hydrogen from these BOH groups, dynamically generating the active sites that trigger propane dehydrogenation.

Understanding these 1-D edge active sites and their reaction mechanisms is essential for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By focusing on enhancing the density and reactivity of these edge sites, researchers can potentially improve catalyst performance in terms of selectivity and conversion rates for ODHP reactions.

The study demonstrates that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, are critical factors in determining the catalyst's effectiveness. This knowledge can guide future catalyst design strategies, emphasizing the importance of optimizing edge structures and their chemical properties to achieve better performance in commercial ODHP applications.

该文献提供了关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应性能的见解，特别关注了一维边缘活性位点。

催化剂结构由二维六方晶格组成，在蒸汽活化过程中形成了新的边缘。这些边缘，特别是锯齿形边缘，作为ODHP反应的主要一维活性位点。活性位点的空间分布由两种硼物种特征化：一种与平面上的氮配位（二维），另一种与边缘处的氧结合（一维）。

这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质对催化剂性能贡献显著。边缘处的BOH基团在反应机理中起着关键作用。分子氧从这些BOH基团中提取氢，动态生成触发丙烷脱氢的活性位点。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点及其反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂至关重要。通过关注提高这些边缘位点的密度和反应活性，研究人员可能改善ODHP反应的选择性和转化率，从而提高催化剂性能。

该研究表明，活性位点的空间分布和维度，特别是一维边缘位点，是决定催化剂有效性的关键因素。这些知识可以指导未来的催化剂设计策略，强调优化边缘结构及其化学性质的重要性，以在商业ODHP应用中获得更好的性能。
