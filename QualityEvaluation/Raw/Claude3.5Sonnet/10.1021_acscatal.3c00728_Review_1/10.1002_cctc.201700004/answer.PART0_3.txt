[2] "TEM images viewed along the [001] direction (Figure2a and FigureS6) revealed that the most frequently exposed lateral termination facets were {10 0}, {01 0}, and {1 00}, suggesting that the terminated configuration had zigzag edges."

[3] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge,9 and the B/N ratio (1.28, point2) at the edge was higher than that (0.95, point4) of the in-plane (Figure2b)."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Figure2d, inset)."

[5] "We have demonstrated that boron nitride, upon steam activation to generate BOH groups at the edges, efficiently catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with a superior selectivity toward propylene and a significantly minimized CO2 emission."

The literature primarily focuses on the 1-D edge active sites of boron nitride catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). These edge sites play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance and reaction mechanisms.

The spatial distribution of active sites is concentrated at the edges of the boron nitride structure. Steam activation creates a large number of new edges with zigzag configurations, as revealed by TEM analyses. These edges have distinct properties compared to the in-plane structure, including a higher π* to σ* ratio and a higher B/N ratio.

The dimensionality of the active sites is primarily 1-D, as they are located along the edges of the 2-D boron nitride sheets. This 1-D nature of the active sites contributes to their unique properties and reactivity.

The edge sites contain two types of boron-oxygen bonding: edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and BOH groups. These BOH groups at the edges are key to the catalyst's performance in ODHP reactions.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites has led to the development of a highly efficient catalyst for ODHP. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst demonstrates superior selectivity toward propylene and significantly minimized CO2 emission.

This insight into the importance of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by highlighting the need to focus on edge modification and optimization in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. Future catalyst designs could aim to maximize the number of edge sites and optimize their chemical environment to enhance catalytic performance.

这篇文献主要关注氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中氮化硼催化剂的一维边缘活性位点。这些边缘位点在催化剂的性能和反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。

活性位点的空间分布集中在氮化硼结构的边缘。透射电子显微镜(TEM)分析表明，蒸汽活化创造了大量具有之字形构型的新边缘。与平面内结构相比，这些边缘具有独特的性质，包括更高的π*与σ*比率和更高的B/N比率。

活性位点的维度主要是一维的，因为它们位于二维氮化硼片的边缘。这种活性位点的一维特性赋予了它们独特的性质和反应活性。

边缘位点包含两种类型的硼-氧键合：与两个桥接氧原子键合的边缘硼位点和BOH基团。这些位于边缘的BOH基团是催化剂在ODHP反应中性能优异的关键。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的性质和反应机理，促进了ODHP反应高效催化剂的开发。边缘羟基化的氮化硼催化剂表现出对丙烯的优异选择性和显著降低的CO2排放。

这种对一维边缘活性位点重要性的认识，为商业应用设计更高效的催化剂提供了指导，强调了在ODHP反应的B基催化剂中需要关注边缘修饰和优化。未来的催化剂设计可以致力于最大化边缘位点数量并优化其化学环境，以提高催化性能。
