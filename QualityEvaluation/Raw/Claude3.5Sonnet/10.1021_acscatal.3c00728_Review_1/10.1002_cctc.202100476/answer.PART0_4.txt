[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts"

[3] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

[4] "In recent years, the superior activity of h-BN in ODHP was demonstrated, which inspired a wave for the research of boron-based ODHP catalysts. Meanwhile, the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in ODHP have been extensively studied."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional structures, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers described in this study, show superior performance compared to bulk or 3D catalysts. This is primarily due to the enhanced exposure of active sites and improved mass transfer characteristics of 1D structures.

The 1D nanofiber catalysts facilitate better transmission of substances and expose a higher number of active sites, leading to increased catalytic activity. This is evidenced by the remarkably higher productivity of olefins (24.9golefinsgBN1h1) achieved by the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The research on h-BN in ODHP has led to extensive studies on the active origin and reaction mechanism, which in turn helps in developing strategies to maximize the exposure and utilization of active sites.

By leveraging the advantages of 1D structures, such as enhanced mass transfer and increased active site exposure, researchers can design catalysts with improved performance for ODHP reactions. This approach opens up new possibilities for creating more efficient boron-based catalysts that could potentially meet the requirements for commercial ODHP applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。一维结构，如本研究中描述的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维，与体相或3D催化剂相比表现出优越的性能。这主要是由于一维结构增强了活性位点的暴露和改善了物质传递特性。

一维纳米纤维催化剂促进了物质的更好传递，并暴露了更多的活性位点，从而提高了催化活性。这一点从h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂实现的显著更高的烯烃生产率（24.9golefinsgBN1h1）可以得到证实，该生产率比体相h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂都要高。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂贡献重大。对ODHP中h-BN的研究已导致对活性起源和反应机理的广泛研究，这反过来有助于开发策略以最大化活性位点的暴露和利用。

通过利用一维结构的优势，如增强的物质传递和增加的活性位点暴露，研究人员可以设计出ODHP反应性能更好的催化剂。这种方法为创造更高效的硼基催化剂开辟了新的可能性，这些催化剂可能满足商业ODHP应用的要求。
