The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional structures, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study, have shown superior performance compared to bulk or 3D catalysts. This is primarily due to the enhanced exposure of active sites and improved mass transfer in 1D structures.

The unique properties of 1D edge active sites contribute to more efficient catalysts in several ways:

1. Increased active site exposure: The 1D structure allows for a higher proportion of active sites to be accessible to reactants.

2. Enhanced mass transfer: The fibrous structure facilitates better movement of reactants and products through the catalyst.

3. Improved catalytic efficiency: Under high space velocity conditions, 1D structures perform better due to easier access to active sites.

4. Higher conversion rates: The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst showed higher propane conversion compared to bulk h-BN catalysts.

5. Better stability: The 1D structure, combined with the SiO2 support, provides improved catalyst stability.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites and leveraging the benefits of 1D structures, researchers can develop catalysts with higher productivity, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study, show superior performance due to their ability to facilitate substance transmission and expose more active sites. This is evidenced by the remarkably higher productivity of the nanofiber catalyst compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, particularly the BOH groups at the edges and defects of h-BN, contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. These sites are more easily exposed in the one-dimensional structure, leading to better mass transfer and higher catalytic efficiency, especially under high space velocity conditions.

Understanding these reaction mechanisms and the role of edge active sites has led to the design of more efficient catalysts. By dispersing h-BN on a one-dimensional SiO2 support, researchers have created a catalyst with improved space utilization of h-BN and higher olefins productivity. This approach provides a new strategy for preparing more effective boron-based catalysts for potential commercial applications in ODHP reactions.
