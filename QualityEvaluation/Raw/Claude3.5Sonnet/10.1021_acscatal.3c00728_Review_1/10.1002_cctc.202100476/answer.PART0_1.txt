[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table1) used in the ODHP reaction."

[3] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

[4] "In the previous work, based on various means of spectroscopy studies, we proposed the BOH at the edges and defects of h-BN as the active sites in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by means of experimental and theoretical methods, which was subsequently confirmed by other groups."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional nanomaterials, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study, show superior performance due to their ability to facilitate substance transmission and expose more active sites. This is evidenced by the remarkably higher productivity of the nanofiber catalyst compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, particularly the BOH groups at the edges and defects of h-BN, contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. These sites are more easily exposed in the one-dimensional structure, leading to better mass transfer and higher catalytic efficiency, especially under high space velocity conditions.

Understanding these reaction mechanisms and the role of edge active sites has led to the design of more efficient catalysts. By dispersing h-BN on a one-dimensional SiO2 support, researchers have created a catalyst with improved space utilization of h-BN and higher olefins productivity. This approach provides a new strategy for preparing more effective boron-based catalysts for potential commercial applications in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。一维纳米材料，如本研究中描述的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂，由于其促进物质传输和暴露更多活性位点的能力，表现出优越的性能。这一点从纳米纤维催化剂相比体相h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂具有显著更高的生产力得到了证实。

一维边缘活性位点的独特性质，特别是h-BN边缘和缺陷处的BOH基团，对提高催化活性起到了重要作用。这些位点在一维结构中更容易暴露，导致更好的物质传递和更高的催化效率，尤其是在高空速条件下。

理解这些反应机制和边缘活性位点的作用，促进了更高效催化剂的设计。通过将h-BN分散在一维SiO2支撑体上，研究人员创造了一种具有改进的h-BN空间利用率和更高烯烃生产力的催化剂。这种方法为制备更有效的硼基催化剂提供了新的策略，有望在ODHP反应的商业应用中发挥作用。
