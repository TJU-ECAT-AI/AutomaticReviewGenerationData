[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction"

[3] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

[4] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts"

[5] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional structures, like the h-BN/SiO2 nanofibers described in this study, show superior performance compared to bulk or 3D catalysts. This is primarily due to:

1. Enhanced exposure of active sites: The 1D structure facilitates better exposure of catalytic sites, allowing more sites to participate in the reaction.

2. Improved mass transfer: The fibrous structure enhances the transmission of substances, allowing reactants to more easily reach active sites.

3. Higher catalytic efficiency: The nanofiber catalyst demonstrated remarkably higher productivity of olefins compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

4. Better performance under high space velocity conditions: The 1D structure allows for better catalytic efficiency when reactants are flowing at high speeds, likely due to improved mass transfer and active site accessibility.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing active site exposure and improving mass transfer. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications, focusing on creating structures that optimize these beneficial characteristics of 1D catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。一维结构，如本研究中描述的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维，相比于体相或3D催化剂表现出更优越的性能。这主要是由于：

1. 增强活性位点暴露：一维结构有利于催化位点的更好暴露，使更多位点参与反应。

2. 改善物质传递：纤维状结构增强了物质的传输，使反应物更容易到达活性位点。

3. 更高的催化效率：纳米纤维催化剂展示了比体相h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂明显更高的烯烃生产率。

4. 在高空速条件下表现更好：一维结构在反应物高速流动时允许更好的催化效率，可能是由于改善了物质传递和活性位点可及性。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于催化剂设计，强调了最大化活性位点暴露和改善物质传递的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂，重点关注创建优化这些一维催化剂有益特性的结构。
