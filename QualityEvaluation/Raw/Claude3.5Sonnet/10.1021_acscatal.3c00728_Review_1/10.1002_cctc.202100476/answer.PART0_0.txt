[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "Based on the above considerations, in this work, a new h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was prepared by the electrospinning method, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene."

[3] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction"

[4] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

[5] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional structures, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study, have shown superior performance compared to bulk or 3D catalysts. This is primarily due to the enhanced exposure of active sites and improved mass transfer in 1D structures.

The unique properties of 1D edge active sites contribute to more efficient catalysts in several ways:

1. Increased active site exposure: The 1D structure allows for a higher proportion of active sites to be accessible to reactants.

2. Enhanced mass transfer: The fibrous structure facilitates better movement of reactants and products through the catalyst.

3. Improved catalytic efficiency: Under high space velocity conditions, 1D structures perform better due to easier access to active sites.

4. Higher conversion rates: The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst showed higher propane conversion compared to bulk h-BN catalysts.

5. Better stability: The 1D structure, combined with the SiO2 support, provides improved catalyst stability.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites and leveraging the benefits of 1D structures, researchers can develop catalysts with higher productivity, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。一维结构，如本研究中描述的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂，相比于块状或3D催化剂表现出更优异的性能。这主要是因为一维结构能够增强活性位点的暴露和改善物质传递。

一维边缘活性位点的独特性质通过以下几种方式贡献于更高效的催化剂：

1. 增加活性位点暴露：一维结构允许更高比例的活性位点能被反应物接触。

2. 增强物质传递：纤维状结构有助于反应物和产物在催化剂中更好地移动。

3. 提高催化效率：在高空速条件下，由于更容易接触活性位点，一维结构表现更佳。

4. 更高的转化率：h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂相比块状h-BN催化剂显示出更高的丙烷转化率。

5. 更好的稳定性：一维结构结合SiO2支撑体提供了改善的催化剂稳定性。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，有助于设计出更适合商业应用的高效催化剂。通过优化活性位点的空间分布并利用一维结构的优势，研究人员可以开发出具有更高生产力、选择性和稳定性的ODHP反应催化剂。
