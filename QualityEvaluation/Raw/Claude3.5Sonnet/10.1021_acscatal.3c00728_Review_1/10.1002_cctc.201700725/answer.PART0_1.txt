[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, s-BN manifested a remarkable 100% selectivity without any trace of byproducts at an ethane conversion of 9.2%."

[3] "Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

[4] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[5] "Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. However, we can draw some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the nanosheets, indicating a 1-D distribution of active sites. This edge-based activity is crucial for the catalyst's performance, as it allows for high selectivity and conversion rates.

The 2-D nature of the BN nanosheets provides a high surface area, which contributes to improved catalyst performance. However, the majority of the surface remains inactive, emphasizing the importance of the edge sites.

Understanding the unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites has led to insights into the reaction mechanism. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, and BOH active sites form at these edges, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

This understanding of 1-D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing edge exposure in BN-based materials. Future catalyst designs could focus on increasing the number of accessible edge sites while maintaining the 2-D nanosheet structure for high surface area.

While this study focused on ethane, the insights gained about the importance of edge sites and their role in the reaction mechanism could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for propane ODH and other similar reactions in commercial applications.

虽然这篇文献主要关注硼氮(BN)纳米片在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而不是丙烷，但我们仍可以得出一些关于B基催化剂中活性位点空间分布和维度的见解：

BN催化剂中的活性位点主要位于纳米片的边缘，表明活性位点呈1-D分布。这种基于边缘的活性对催化剂的性能至关重要，因为它可以实现高选择性和转化率。

BN纳米片的2-D特性提供了高比表面积，这有助于提高催化剂性能。然而，大部分表面仍然保持不活跃，强调了边缘位点的重要性。

理解这些1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质，使我们深入了解了反应机理。边缘B原子参与O2的活化，BOH活性位点在这些边缘形成，促进了脱氢过程。

对1-D边缘活性位点的理解有助于催化剂设计，强调了在BN基材料中最大化边缘暴露的重要性。未来的催化剂设计可以集中于增加可访问的边缘位点数量，同时保持2-D纳米片结构以获得高比表面积。

虽然这项研究集中在乙烷上，但关于边缘位点重要性及其在反应机理中作用的见解可能适用于设计更高效的丙烷ODH催化剂和其他类似的商业应用反应。
