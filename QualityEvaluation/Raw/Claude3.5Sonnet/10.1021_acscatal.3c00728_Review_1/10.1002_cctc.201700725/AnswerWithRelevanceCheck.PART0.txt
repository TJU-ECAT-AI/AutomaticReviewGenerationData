          [1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, s-BN manifested a remarkable 100% selectivity without any trace of byproducts at an ethane conversion of 9.2%."

[3] "Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

[4] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[5] "Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[6] "Notably, the appearance of CO ( =1067cm1) and BO ( =1220cm1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X ."

[7] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically BN nanosheets, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. While the study focuses on ethane ODH rather than propane, the insights can be applied to similar reactions:

1. Spatial Distribution: The active sites are primarily located at the edges of the BN nanosheets, indicating a 1-D distribution. This edge-specific activity is crucial for the catalyst's performance, as evidenced by the high selectivity (100% at 9.2% conversion) achieved.

2. Dimensionality: The catalyst consists of 2-D BN nanosheets, but the active sites are confined to the 1-D edges. This unique structure contributes to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. Active Site Properties: The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, forming BOH and BO active sites. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation process without dissociating O2, contributing to high selectivity by preventing overoxidation.

4. Reaction Mechanisms: Two catalytic pathways are identified based on reaction conditions:
   a) At low temperatures (X <10%): BOH active sites form, promoting direct dehydrogenation of ethane.
   b) At high temperatures (X >10%): BO active sites form, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane.

5. Performance Influence: The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to high selectivity and conversion rates. The majority of the catalyst surface remains inactive, emphasizing the importance of edge sites.

Understanding these aspects contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:
1. Focusing on maximizing edge exposure in BN-based materials.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions to control the formation of specific active sites (BOH vs. BO).
3. Developing synthesis methods that prioritize the formation of active edge sites.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize edge structures for long-term catalytic performance.

While this study focused on ethane ODH, similar principles could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for propane ODH and other related reactions in commercial applications.

          B基催化剂，特别是BN纳米片中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在氧化脱氢反应中的性能。虽然研究重点是乙烷ODH而非丙烷，但这些见解可应用于类似反应：

1. 空间分布：活性位点主要位于BN纳米片的边缘，表明呈1D分布。这种边缘特异性活性对催化剂性能至关重要，这从达到的高选择性（9.2%转化率时100%选择性）可以得到证实。

2. 维度：催化剂由2D BN纳米片组成，但活性位点局限于1D边缘。这种独特结构有助于催化剂的高选择性和效率。

3. 活性位点特性：边缘B原子参与O2活化，形成BOH和BO活性位点。这些位点在不解离O2的情况下促进脱氢过程，通过防止过度氧化贡献高选择性。

4. 反应机理：根据反应条件确定两种催化途径：
   a) 低温（X <10%）：形成BOH活性位点，促进乙烷的直接脱氢。
   b) 高温（X >10%）：形成BO活性位点，能从乙烷中提取氢。

5. 性能影响：这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质有助于高选择性和转化率。催化剂表面大部分保持不活跃，强调了边缘位点的重要性。

理解这些方面有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂：
1. 专注于最大化BN基材料中的边缘暴露。
2. 优化反应条件以控制特定活性位点（BOH vs. BO）的形成。
3. 开发优先形成活性边缘位点的合成方法。
4. 探索稳定边缘结构以实现长期催化性能的方法。

虽然本研究集中于乙烷ODH，但类似原理可能适用于设计更高效的丙烷ODH催化剂和其他相关商业应用反应。
