[1] "Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane;"

[2] "Notably, the appearance of CO ( =1067cm1) and BO ( =1220cm1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X ."

[3] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[4] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. However, we can draw some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

1. The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the nanosheets, suggesting a 1-D distribution of active sites.

2. The formation of BO(H) sites at the edges of BN is crucial for the catalytic activity. These edge sites are responsible for O2 activation and ethane dehydrogenation.

3. The dimensionality of the catalyst (2-D BN nanosheets) influences the accessibility and distribution of these 1-D edge active sites, potentially enhancing their performance compared to bulk 3-D structures.

4. Understanding the unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing edge exposure and controlling the formation of BO(H) species.

5. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of BOH active sites at low temperatures and BO sites at higher temperatures, both located at the edges. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient catalysts by optimizing edge structures and reaction conditions.

While the study doesn't directly address propane dehydrogenation, these insights into the importance of edge sites and their activation mechanisms in ethane ODH can likely be extended to inform the design of catalysts for propane ODH and other related reactions.

The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the nanosheets, indicating a 1-D distribution of active sites. This edge-based activity is crucial for the catalyst's performance, as it allows for high selectivity and conversion rates.

The 2-D nature of the BN nanosheets provides a high surface area, which contributes to improved catalyst performance. However, the majority of the surface remains inactive, emphasizing the importance of the edge sites.

Understanding the unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites has led to insights into the reaction mechanism. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, and BOH active sites form at these edges, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

This understanding of 1-D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing edge exposure in BN-based materials. Future catalyst designs could focus on increasing the number of accessible edge sites while maintaining the 2-D nanosheet structure for high surface area.

While this study focused on ethane, the insights gained about the importance of edge sites and their role in the reaction mechanism could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for propane ODH and other similar reactions in commercial applications.

[2] "Notably, s-BN manifested a remarkable 100% selectivity without any trace of byproducts at an ethane conversion of 9.2%."

[3] "Another notable finding was the substantially improved consumption rate of ethane over s-BN, which was 5.5times higher than that over b-BN (Figure1b), provided that there was a 108-fold enhancement in the specific surface area for s-BN (TableS1, FigureS4). Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

4. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, which is critical for the ODH reaction. This suggests that controlling the edge structure and composition is key to designing more efficient catalysts.

5. The formation of BOH active sites at the edges facilitates the dehydrogenation of ethane, highlighting the unique properties of these 1-D edge sites in the reaction mechanism.

Understanding these aspects of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Focusing on maximizing the number of edge sites through nanostructuring.
2. Tailoring the edge composition and structure to optimize O2 activation and substrate interaction.
3. Developing synthesis methods that prioritize the formation of active edge sites over inactive basal plane areas.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize and maintain the edge structure under reaction conditions for long-term catalytic performance.

While this study focuses on ethane ODH, similar principles may apply to propane ODH, where optimizing the 1-D edge active sites could lead to improved selectivity and conversion rates in commercial applications.

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. However, we can extrapolate some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

1. The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the 2D nanosheets. This is evidenced by the formation of BO and BOH species at the edges, which play crucial roles in the catalytic process.

2. The dimensionality of the active sites appears to be 1D, as they are confined to the edges of the 2D BN nanosheets. This unique 1D edge structure contributes to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the reaction conditions, which affect the nature of the active sites. At lower temperatures and conversions, BOH sites dominate, while at higher temperatures and conversions, BO sites become more prevalent.

4. Understanding the formation and behavior of these 1D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The study shows that the presence of ethane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN, forming BO(H) sites that complete the dehydrogenation cycle.

5. The unique properties of these 1D edge sites, such as their ability to activate ethane without dissociating O2, contribute to the high selectivity of the catalyst, preventing overoxidation and combustion products.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, researchers should focus on:

1. Maximizing the number of edge sites in BN-based materials.
2. Controlling the formation and distribution of BOH and BO sites.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions to maintain high selectivity while increasing conversion rates.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize the active sites for long-term catalytic performance.

By understanding and exploiting the unique properties of these 1D edge active sites, researchers can potentially develop more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, including those involving propane.
