[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, the appearance of CO (ν=1067cm−1) and BO (ν=1220cm−1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X."

[3] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[4] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. However, we can extrapolate some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

1. The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the 2D nanosheets. This is evidenced by the formation of BO and BOH species at the edges, which play crucial roles in the catalytic process.

2. The dimensionality of the active sites appears to be 1D, as they are confined to the edges of the 2D BN nanosheets. This unique 1D edge structure contributes to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. The performance of the catalyst is influenced by the reaction conditions, which affect the nature of the active sites. At lower temperatures and conversions, BOH sites dominate, while at higher temperatures and conversions, BO sites become more prevalent.

4. Understanding the formation and behavior of these 1D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The study shows that the presence of ethane promotes the activation of adsorbed O2 towards the edges of BN, forming BO(H) sites that complete the dehydrogenation cycle.

5. The unique properties of these 1D edge sites, such as their ability to activate ethane without dissociating O2, contribute to the high selectivity of the catalyst, preventing overoxidation and combustion products.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, researchers should focus on:

1. Maximizing the number of edge sites in BN-based materials.
2. Controlling the formation and distribution of BOH and BO sites.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions to maintain high selectivity while increasing conversion rates.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize the active sites for long-term catalytic performance.

By understanding and exploiting the unique properties of these 1D edge active sites, researchers can potentially develop more efficient and selective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, including those involving propane.

虽然这篇文献主要关注氮化硼（BN）纳米片用于乙烷的氧化脱氢，而非丙烷，但我们可以从中推断出一些关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度的见解：

1. BN催化剂中的活性位点主要位于2D纳米片的边缘。这一点可以从边缘形成的BO和BOH物种得到证实，这些物种在催化过程中起着关键作用。

2. 活性位点的维度似乎是1D的，因为它们局限于2D BN纳米片的边缘。这种独特的1D边缘结构有助于催化剂的高选择性和效率。

3. 催化剂的性能受反应条件的影响，这些条件影响活性位点的性质。在较低的温度和转化率下，BOH位点占主导地位，而在较高的温度和转化率下，BO位点变得更加普遍。

4. 了解这些1D边缘活性位点的形成和行为对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。研究表明，乙烷的存在促进了吸附O2向BN边缘的活化，形成完成脱氢循环的BO(H)位点。

5. 这些1D边缘位点的独特性质，如它们能够在不解离O2的情况下活化乙烷，有助于催化剂的高选择性，防止过度氧化和燃烧产物的产生。

为了设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，研究人员应该关注：

1. 最大化BN基材料中的边缘位点数量。
2. 控制BOH和BO位点的形成和分布。
3. 优化反应条件，在提高转化率的同时保持高选择性。
4. 探索稳定活性位点以实现长期催化性能的方法。

通过理解和利用这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质，研究人员可能开发出更高效和选择性的催化剂，用于氧化脱氢反应，包括涉及丙烷的反应。
