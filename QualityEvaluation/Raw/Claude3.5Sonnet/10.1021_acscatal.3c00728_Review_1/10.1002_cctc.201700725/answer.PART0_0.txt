[1] "Indeed, our operando spectroscopic results showed that BO(H) formation was accompanied by an induction phase of C2H6 activation and that it was these BO(H) sites that served as the active sites for the ODH ethane;"

[2] "Notably, the appearance of CO ( =1067cm1) and BO ( =1220cm1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X ."

[3] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[4] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. However, we can draw some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

1. The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the nanosheets, suggesting a 1-D distribution of active sites.

2. The formation of BO(H) sites at the edges of BN is crucial for the catalytic activity. These edge sites are responsible for O2 activation and ethane dehydrogenation.

3. The dimensionality of the catalyst (2-D BN nanosheets) influences the accessibility and distribution of these 1-D edge active sites, potentially enhancing their performance compared to bulk 3-D structures.

4. Understanding the unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing edge exposure and controlling the formation of BO(H) species.

5. The reaction mechanism involves the formation of BOH active sites at low temperatures and BO sites at higher temperatures, both located at the edges. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient catalysts by optimizing edge structures and reaction conditions.

While the study doesn't directly address propane dehydrogenation, these insights into the importance of edge sites and their activation mechanisms in ethane ODH can likely be extended to inform the design of catalysts for propane ODH and other related reactions.

这篇文献主要关注氮化硼(BN)纳米片在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而非丙烷。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于B基催化剂活性位点空间分布和维度的见解：

1. BN催化剂的活性位点主要位于纳米片的边缘，表明活性位点呈现一维分布。

2. 在BN边缘形成的BO(H)位点对催化活性至关重要。这些边缘位点负责O2的活化和乙烷的脱氢。

3. 催化剂的维度（二维BN纳米片）影响了这些一维边缘活性位点的可及性和分布，可能比体相三维结构具有更高的性能。

4. 了解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质有助于催化剂设计，强调了最大化边缘暴露和控制BO(H)物种形成的重要性。

5. 反应机理涉及在低温下形成BOH活性位点和在高温下形成BO位点，两者都位于边缘。这一理解可以通过优化边缘结构和反应条件来指导开发更高效的催化剂。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及丙烷脱氢，但这些关于边缘位点重要性及其在乙烷ODH中的活化机理的见解可能可以扩展到丙烷ODH和其他相关反应的催化剂设计中。
