[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, s-BN manifested a remarkable 100% selectivity without any trace of byproducts at an ethane conversion of 9.2%."

[3] "Another notable finding was the substantially improved consumption rate of ethane over s-BN, which was 5.5times higher than that over b-BN (Figure1b), provided that there was a 108-fold enhancement in the specific surface area for s-BN (TableS1, FigureS4). Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

[4] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[5] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. However, we can extrapolate some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

1. The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the nanosheets, suggesting a 1-D distribution of active sites. This edge-specific activity is crucial for the catalyst's performance.

2. The high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) showed significantly improved ethane consumption rates compared to bulk BN (b-BN), indicating that increasing the number of edge sites through 2-D nanosheet structures enhances catalytic activity.

3. The majority of the surface area was found to be inactive, further emphasizing the importance of edge sites over basal plane sites in 2-D BN structures.

4. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, which is critical for the ODH reaction. This suggests that controlling the edge structure and composition is key to designing more efficient catalysts.

5. The formation of BOH active sites at the edges facilitates the dehydrogenation of ethane, highlighting the unique properties of these 1-D edge sites in the reaction mechanism.

Understanding these aspects of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Focusing on maximizing the number of edge sites through nanostructuring.
2. Tailoring the edge composition and structure to optimize O2 activation and substrate interaction.
3. Developing synthesis methods that prioritize the formation of active edge sites over inactive basal plane areas.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize and maintain the edge structure under reaction conditions for long-term catalytic performance.

While this study focuses on ethane ODH, similar principles may apply to propane ODH, where optimizing the 1-D edge active sites could lead to improved selectivity and conversion rates in commercial applications.

虽然这篇文献主要关注硼氮(BN)纳米片在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而非丙烷，但我们可以从中推断出一些关于B基催化剂活性位点空间分布和维度的见解：

1. BN催化剂的活性位点主要位于纳米片的边缘，表明活性位点呈1D分布。这种边缘特异性活性对催化剂的性能至关重要。

2. 高比表面积BN纳米片(s-BN)与块状BN(b-BN)相比，显示出显著提高的乙烷消耗速率，说明通过2D纳米片结构增加边缘位点数量可以增强催化活性。

3. 大部分表面积被发现是无活性的，进一步强调了2D BN结构中边缘位点相对于基面位点的重要性。

4. 边缘B原子参与O2的活化，这对ODH反应至关重要。这表明控制边缘结构和组成是设计更高效催化剂的关键。

5. 在边缘形成的BOH活性位点有助于乙烷的脱氢，突显了这些1D边缘位点在反应机理中的独特性质。

理解B基催化剂中1D边缘活性位点的这些方面有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，具体体现在：

1. 专注于通过纳米结构化最大化边缘位点数量。
2. 调整边缘组成和结构，以优化O2活化和底物相互作用。
3. 开发优先形成活性边缘位点而非无活性基面区域的合成方法。
4. 探索在反应条件下稳定和维持边缘结构的方法，以实现长期催化性能。

虽然这项研究侧重于乙烷ODH，但类似的原理可能适用于丙烷ODH，其中优化1D边缘活性位点可能会导致商业应用中选择性和转化率的提高。
