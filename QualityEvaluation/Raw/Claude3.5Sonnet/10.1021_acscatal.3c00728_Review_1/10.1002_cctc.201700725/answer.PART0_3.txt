[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, the appearance of CO ( =1067cm1) and BO ( =1220cm1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X ."

[3] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[4] "Altogether, we were able to draw two possible catalytic pathways, as determined by the bond-breaking position of ethane (Scheme1). Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

The literature primarily focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane rather than propane. However, we can draw some insights about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts:

1. The active sites in BN catalysts are primarily located at the edges of the nanosheets, suggesting a 1-D distribution of active sites.

2. The high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) catalyst shows better performance compared to bulk BN, indicating that increasing the number of edge sites improves catalytic activity.

3. The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, forming BO and BOH active sites that facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to high selectivity towards ethylene production, with the ability to achieve 100% selectivity at low conversion rates.

5. Understanding the reaction mechanisms at these edge sites, such as the formation of BOH active sites at low temperatures and BO sites at higher temperatures, can guide the design of more efficient catalysts.

For commercial applications, this understanding suggests that optimizing the edge structure of B-based catalysts and maximizing the number of accessible edge sites could lead to improved catalyst performance. Additionally, controlling the formation of specific active sites (BOH vs. BO) through temperature and reaction conditions could help tailor the catalyst for desired selectivity and conversion rates.

这篇文献主要集中于研究氮化硼(BN)纳米片在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而非丙烷。但是，我们可以从中得到一些关于B基催化剂活性位点空间分布和维度的见解：

1. BN催化剂的活性位点主要位于纳米片的边缘，表明活性位点呈1D分布。

2. 高比表面积的BN纳米片(s-BN)催化剂比体相BN表现更好，说明增加边缘位点数量可以提高催化活性。

3. 边缘B原子参与O2的活化，形成BO和BOH活性位点，促进脱氢反应。

4. 这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质有助于提高乙烯生成的选择性，在低转化率下甚至可以达到100%的选择性。

5. 理解这些边缘位点的反应机理，如在低温下形成BOH活性位点和高温下形成BO位点，可以指导设计更高效的催化剂。

对于商业应用，这些理解表明，优化B基催化剂的边缘结构和最大化可接触的边缘位点数量可能会提高催化剂性能。此外，通过温度和反应条件控制特定活性位点（BOH vs. BO）的形成，可以帮助调整催化剂以达到所需的选择性和转化率。
