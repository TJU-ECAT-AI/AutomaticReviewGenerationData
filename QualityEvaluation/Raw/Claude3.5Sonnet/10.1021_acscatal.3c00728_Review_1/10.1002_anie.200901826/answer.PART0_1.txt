[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[3] "This result indicates that surface modification with B2O3 solely affects non-selective active sites, as it has been shown for P2O5 in the ODH of n-butane."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes in the graphene layers. This suggests that the active sites are likely distributed in a 1-D or 2-D manner along the CNT surface.

The study does not explicitly discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites. Instead, it focuses on how B2O3 modification affects non-selective active sites, improving selectivity towards propene formation. The research indicates that understanding the role of boron in blocking combustion sites and suppressing the formation of non-selective oxygen species is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts.

While the paper does not directly address the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications based on understanding 1-D edge active sites, it does suggest that optimizing the amount of boron dopant and reaction conditions could lead to improved propene yields. Further research into the specific nature and distribution of active sites could potentially contribute to the development of more effective catalysts for ODHP reactions.

该文献没有提供关于B基催化剂在ODHP反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度的详细信息。但是，它提到硼和氧在CNT基质中高度分散，BOx物种以高度分散的亚单层沉积形式填充石墨烯层的表面缺陷和孔洞。这表明活性位点可能以1-D或2-D的方式分布在CNT表面。

研究并未明确讨论1-D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理。相反，它关注B2O3修饰如何影响非选择性活性位点，从而提高丙烯形成的选择性。研究表明，了解硼在阻断燃烧位点和抑制非选择性氧物种形成方面的作用对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。

虽然该论文没有直接讨论基于理解1-D边缘活性位点来设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，但它确实提出，通过优化硼掺杂量和反应条件可能会提高丙烯产率。对活性位点的具体性质和分布进行进一步研究可能有助于开发更有效的ODHP反应催化剂。
