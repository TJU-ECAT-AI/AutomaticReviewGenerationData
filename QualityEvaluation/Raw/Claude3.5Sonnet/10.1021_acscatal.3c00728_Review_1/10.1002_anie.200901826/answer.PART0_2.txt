The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The boron species are highly dispersed throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, with the majority of amorphous B2O3 deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. This creates a 1-D distribution along the CNT length. Additionally, a minor fraction covers the outer CNT surface as a thin 2-D layer, while a highly dispersed sub-monolayer of BOx species is omnipresent, potentially creating 0-D or isolated active sites.

The unique properties of these active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites at CNT tips, contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance. The covalent bonding of boron species to the CNT structure improves thermal stability, while the B2O3 filling acts as a backbone against oxidation. This arrangement allows for efficient electron transfer and helps maintain catalyst integrity during reactions.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It allows for optimizing the distribution and concentration of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.

2. The improved thermal stability and resistance to oxidation can lead to longer-lasting catalysts in industrial settings.

3. The highly dispersed nature of boron species suggests that even small amounts can significantly impact performance, potentially reducing material costs.

4. The unique 1-D structure of CNTs with B-doping provides a model system for studying reaction mechanisms, which can inform the design of other nanostructured catalysts.

5. The ability to tune the electronic properties of the catalyst through controlled B-doping can lead to more selective and efficient ODHP catalysts.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for commercial ODHP applications, potentially offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。硼物种高度分散在碳纳米管(CNT)基质中，大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的腔体和尖端上，形成沿CNT长度的一维分布。此外，少量B2O3覆盖在CNT外表面形成薄的二维层，而高度分散的亚单层BOx物种则无处不在，可能形成零维或孤立的活性位点。

这些活性位点的独特性质，特别是CNT尖端的一维边缘位点，有助于提高催化性能。硼物种与CNT结构的共价键合提高了热稳定性，而B2O3填充物则作为抗氧化的骨架。这种排列允许高效的电子转移，并有助于在反应过程中保持催化剂的完整性。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 可以优化活性位点的分布和浓度，以最大化催化性能。

2. 提高的热稳定性和抗氧化性可以延长工业环境中催化剂的使用寿命。

3. 硼物种的高度分散性表明，即使少量添加也能显著影响性能，可能降低材料成本。

4. CNT的独特一维结构配合B掺杂提供了一个研究反应机理的模型系统，可以为其他纳米结构催化剂的设计提供信息。

5. 通过控制B掺杂来调节催化剂的电子性质的能力可以带来更高选择性和效率的ODHP催化剂。

利用这些见解，研究人员可以开发出活性、选择性和稳定性更高的商业ODHP应用催化剂，可能为传统的金属基催化剂提供更可持续的替代方案。
