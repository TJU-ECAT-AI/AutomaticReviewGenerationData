[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[3] "One of the remaining drawbacks is the low overall activity of carbon catalysts, which can be overcome by fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts specifically influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with B2O3 deposited mainly in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, and a sub-monolayer of BOx species dispersed on the surface. This suggests a combination of 1-D (along CNT edges), 2-D (on CNT surfaces), and 3-D (in CNT cavities) distributions of active sites.

The unique properties of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, are not explicitly discussed in relation to reaction mechanisms or catalyst design. However, the paper does indicate that the presence of boron oxide helps suppress the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reduces propane adsorption on the reduced catalyst surface, which improves alkene selectivity.

For more efficient catalysts, the literature suggests that fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface could overcome the drawback of low overall activity in carbon catalysts. This implies that understanding and optimizing the distribution and properties of active sites, including 1-D edge sites, could be crucial for designing more effective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

该文献并未详细说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何具体影响其在ODHP反应中的性能。然而，它确实提到硼和氧在CNT基底上高度分散，B2O3主要沉积在CNT的空腔和顶端，而BOx物种的亚单层则分散在表面。这表明活性位点可能同时具有1-D（沿CNT边缘）、2-D（在CNT表面）和3-D（在CNT空腔中）的分布。

文章并未明确讨论这些位点的独特性质，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，与反应机理或催化剂设计的关系。但是，文章确实指出，氧化硼的存在有助于抑制非选择性氧物种的形成，并减少丙烷在还原的催化剂表面上的吸附，从而提高烯烃的选择性。

为了开发更高效的催化剂，文献建议在表面制造高浓度的选择性位点可以克服碳催化剂总体活性低的缺点。这意味着，理解和优化活性位点的分布和性质，包括1-D边缘位点，对于设计更有效的商业ODHP应用催化剂可能至关重要。
