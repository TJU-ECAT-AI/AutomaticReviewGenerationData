[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions are not explicitly discussed in terms of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D structures. However, the literature provides some insights into the distribution of boron species on carbon nanotubes (CNTs):

1. Boron is highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate.

2. There is a minor amorphous coating on the outer CNT surface, with a thickness of about 1-2 nm.

3. A highly dispersed sub-monolayer of BOx species is present, likely filling surface defects and holes in the graphene layers.

4. Some B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.

These observations suggest a complex spatial distribution of boron species, potentially creating various types of active sites with different dimensionalities. The highly dispersed nature of boron and its interaction with the CNT structure (e.g., filling defects and covalent bonding) likely contribute to the improved catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

The unique properties of these boron-modified sites, such as their ability to suppress the formation of non-selective oxygen species and block combustion sites, contribute to higher propene selectivity. Understanding these mechanisms helps in designing more efficient catalysts by optimizing boron loading and distribution to maximize the number of selective active sites while minimizing undesirable combustion reactions.

To further improve catalyst design for commercial applications, future research could focus on:

1. Investigating the specific nature of 1-D edge active sites and their role in ODHP reactions.
2. Optimizing the spatial distribution of boron species to maximize the number of selective active sites.
3. Exploring ways to increase the overall activity of carbon catalysts while maintaining high selectivity.
4. Studying the long-term stability and performance of boron-modified CNT catalysts under industrial conditions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响没有明确讨论1-D、2-D和3-D结构。然而，文献提供了一些关于硼物种在碳纳米管(CNTs)上分布的见解：

1. 硼在CNT基底上高度分散。

2. CNT外表面有少量厚度约1-2 nm的无定形涂层。

3. 存在高度分散的BOx亚单层，可能填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔洞。

4. 一些B2O3沉积在CNT的腔体和尖端。

这些观察表明硼物种具有复杂的空间分布，可能创造出具有不同维度的各种类型的活性位点。硼的高度分散性及其与CNT结构的相互作用(如填充缺陷和共价键合)可能有助于提高ODHP反应的催化性能。

这些硼改性位点的独特性质，如抑制非选择性氧物种的形成和阻断燃烧位点的能力，有助于提高丙烯的选择性。理解这些机制有助于设计更高效的催化剂，通过优化硼负载量和分布来最大化选择性活性位点的数量，同时最小化不良的燃烧反应。

为进一步改进商业应用的催化剂设计，未来的研究可以集中在：

1. 研究1-D边缘活性位点的具体性质及其在ODHP反应中的作用。
2. 优化硼物种的空间分布，以最大化选择性活性位点的数量。
3. 探索提高碳催化剂整体活性的方法，同时保持高选择性。
4. 研究硼改性CNT催化剂在工业条件下的长期稳定性和性能。
