[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, creating a 1-D structure along the nanotubes. This dispersion leads to a highly distributed network of active sites, which enhances the catalyst's overall performance.

The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the improved selectivity towards propene formation. Boron oxide acts as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2 and maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This property leads to suppressed total combustion reactions and lower reoxidation capacity of active sites, resulting in enhanced propene selectivity.

The presence of a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species, along with the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers, creates a unique 1-D edge structure. This structure contributes to the catalyst's efficiency by providing a high density of active sites while maintaining the selectivity advantages of the boron modification.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the distribution and dimensionality of active sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved selectivity, stability, and overall performance for propene production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。硼和氧在CNT基质中高度分散，形成沿纳米管的一维结构。这种分散导致了高度分布的活性位点网络，提高了催化剂的整体性能。

这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质有助于提高对丙烯形成的选择性。氧化硼作为电子缺乏的促进剂，抑制了O2的解离吸附，并在催化剂表面维持选择性氧物种。这一特性导致总燃烧反应被抑制，活性位点的再氧化能力降低，从而提高了丙烯选择性。

BOx物种的高度分散亚单层沉积，以及石墨烯层表面缺陷和孔洞的填充，创造了独特的一维边缘结构。这种结构通过提供高密度的活性位点，同时保持硼修饰的选择性优势，为催化剂的效率做出了贡献。

理解B基催化剂中一维边缘活性位点的这些独特性质和反应机理，可以指导更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂的设计。通过优化活性位点的分布和维度，研究人员可能开发出具有改进的选择性、稳定性和整体性能的丙烯生产催化剂。
