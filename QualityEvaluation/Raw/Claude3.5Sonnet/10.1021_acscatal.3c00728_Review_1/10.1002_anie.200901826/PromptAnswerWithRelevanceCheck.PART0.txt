The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions are not explicitly discussed in terms of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D structures. However, the literature provides some insights into the distribution of boron species on carbon nanotubes (CNTs):

1. Boron is highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate.

2. There is a minor amorphous coating on the outer CNT surface, with a thickness of about 1-2 nm.

3. A highly dispersed sub-monolayer of BOx species is present, likely filling surface defects and holes in the graphene layers.

4. Some B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.

These observations suggest a complex spatial distribution of boron species, potentially creating various types of active sites with different dimensionalities. The highly dispersed nature of boron and its interaction with the CNT structure (e.g., filling defects and covalent bonding) likely contribute to the improved catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

The unique properties of these boron-modified sites, such as their ability to suppress the formation of non-selective oxygen species and block combustion sites, contribute to higher propene selectivity. Understanding these mechanisms helps in designing more efficient catalysts by optimizing boron loading and distribution to maximize the number of selective active sites while minimizing undesirable combustion reactions.

To further improve catalyst design for commercial applications, future research could focus on:

1. Investigating the specific nature of 1-D edge active sites and their role in ODHP reactions.
2. Optimizing the spatial distribution of boron species to maximize the number of selective active sites.
3. Exploring ways to increase the overall activity of carbon catalysts while maintaining high selectivity.
4. Studying the long-term stability and performance of boron-modified CNT catalysts under industrial conditions.

The literature does not provide detailed information about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes in the graphene layers. This suggests that the active sites are likely distributed in a 1-D or 2-D manner along the CNT surface.

The study does not explicitly discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites. Instead, it focuses on how B2O3 modification affects non-selective active sites, improving selectivity towards propene formation. The research indicates that understanding the role of boron in blocking combustion sites and suppressing the formation of non-selective oxygen species is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts.

While the paper does not directly address the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications based on understanding 1-D edge active sites, it does suggest that optimizing the amount of boron dopant and reaction conditions could lead to improved propene yields. Further research into the specific nature and distribution of active sites could potentially contribute to the development of more effective catalysts for ODHP reactions.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The boron species are highly dispersed throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, with the majority of amorphous B2O3 deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. This creates a 1-D distribution along the CNT length. Additionally, a minor fraction covers the outer CNT surface as a thin 2-D layer, while a highly dispersed sub-monolayer of BOx species is omnipresent, potentially creating 0-D or isolated active sites.

The unique properties of these active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites at CNT tips, contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance. The covalent bonding of boron species to the CNT structure improves thermal stability, while the B2O3 filling acts as a backbone against oxidation. This arrangement allows for efficient electron transfer and helps maintain catalyst integrity during reactions.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It allows for optimizing the distribution and concentration of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.

2. The improved thermal stability and resistance to oxidation can lead to longer-lasting catalysts in industrial settings.

3. The highly dispersed nature of boron species suggests that even small amounts can significantly impact performance, potentially reducing material costs.

4. The unique 1-D structure of CNTs with B-doping provides a model system for studying reaction mechanisms, which can inform the design of other nanostructured catalysts.

5. The ability to tune the electronic properties of the catalyst through controlled B-doping can lead to more selective and efficient ODHP catalysts.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for commercial ODHP applications, potentially offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。硼物种高度分散在碳纳米管(CNT)基质中，大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的腔体和尖端上，形成沿CNT长度的一维分布。此外，少量B2O3覆盖在CNT外表面形成薄的二维层，而高度分散的亚单层BOx物种则无处不在，可能形成零维或孤立的活性位点。

这些活性位点的独特性质，特别是CNT尖端的一维边缘位点，有助于提高催化性能。硼物种与CNT结构的共价键合提高了热稳定性，而B2O3填充物则作为抗氧化的骨架。这种排列允许高效的电子转移，并有助于在反应过程中保持催化剂的完整性。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 可以优化活性位点的分布和浓度，以最大化催化性能。

2. 提高的热稳定性和抗氧化性可以延长工业环境中催化剂的使用寿命。

3. 硼物种的高度分散性表明，即使少量添加也能显著影响性能，可能降低材料成本。

4. CNT的独特一维结构配合B掺杂提供了一个研究反应机理的模型系统，可以为其他纳米结构催化剂的设计提供信息。

5. 通过控制B掺杂来调节催化剂的电子性质的能力可以带来更高选择性和效率的ODHP催化剂。

利用这些见解，研究人员可以开发出活性、选择性和稳定性更高的商业ODHP应用催化剂，可能为传统的金属基催化剂提供更可持续的替代方案。

[2] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, creating a 1-D structure along the nanotubes. This dispersion leads to a highly distributed network of active sites, which enhances the catalyst's overall performance.

The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the improved selectivity towards propene formation. Boron oxide acts as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2 and maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This property leads to suppressed total combustion reactions and lower reoxidation capacity of active sites, resulting in enhanced propene selectivity.

The presence of a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species, along with the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers, creates a unique 1-D edge structure. This structure contributes to the catalyst's efficiency by providing a high density of active sites while maintaining the selectivity advantages of the boron modification.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites in B-based catalysts can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the distribution and dimensionality of active sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved selectivity, stability, and overall performance for propene production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。硼和氧在CNT基质中高度分散，形成沿纳米管的一维结构。这种分散导致了高度分布的活性位点网络，提高了催化剂的整体性能。

这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质有助于提高对丙烯形成的选择性。氧化硼作为电子缺乏的促进剂，抑制了O2的解离吸附，并在催化剂表面维持选择性氧物种。这一特性导致总燃烧反应被抑制，活性位点的再氧化能力降低，从而提高了丙烯选择性。

BOx物种的高度分散亚单层沉积，以及石墨烯层表面缺陷和孔洞的填充，创造了独特的一维边缘结构。这种结构通过提供高密度的活性位点，同时保持硼修饰的选择性优势，为催化剂的效率做出了贡献。

理解B基催化剂中一维边缘活性位点的这些独特性质和反应机理，可以指导更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂的设计。通过优化活性位点的分布和维度，研究人员可能开发出具有改进的选择性、稳定性和整体性能的丙烯生产催化剂。

The literature does not provide detailed information on how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts specifically influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with B2O3 deposited mainly in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, and a sub-monolayer of BOx species dispersed on the surface. This suggests a combination of 1-D (along CNT edges), 2-D (on CNT surfaces), and 3-D (in CNT cavities) distributions of active sites.

The unique properties of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, are not explicitly discussed in relation to reaction mechanisms or catalyst design. However, the paper does indicate that the presence of boron oxide helps suppress the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reduces propane adsorption on the reduced catalyst surface, which improves alkene selectivity.

For more efficient catalysts, the literature suggests that fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface could overcome the drawback of low overall activity in carbon catalysts. This implies that understanding and optimizing the distribution and properties of active sites, including 1-D edge sites, could be crucial for designing more effective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

该文献并未详细说明B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何具体影响其在ODHP反应中的性能。然而，它确实提到硼和氧在CNT基底上高度分散，B2O3主要沉积在CNT的空腔和顶端，而BOx物种的亚单层则分散在表面。这表明活性位点可能同时具有1-D（沿CNT边缘）、2-D（在CNT表面）和3-D（在CNT空腔中）的分布。

文章并未明确讨论这些位点的独特性质，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，与反应机理或催化剂设计的关系。但是，文章确实指出，氧化硼的存在有助于抑制非选择性氧物种的形成，并减少丙烷在还原的催化剂表面上的吸附，从而提高烯烃的选择性。

为了开发更高效的催化剂，文献建议在表面制造高浓度的选择性位点可以克服碳催化剂总体活性低的缺点。这意味着，理解和优化活性位点的分布和性质，包括1-D边缘位点，对于设计更有效的商业ODHP应用催化剂可能至关重要。
