The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The document appears to be about boron nitride nanosheets and their oxidation resistance, which is unrelated to the specific catalytic process asked about in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately answer the question about B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, their active sites, or how understanding these contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

给出的文献中没有任何与回答问题相关的信息，该问题涉及B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。该文档似乎是关于氮化硼纳米片及其抗氧化性的，这与问题中询问的特定催化过程无关。由于提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法准确回答关于ODHP反应的B基催化剂、其活性位点或了解这些如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂的问题。
