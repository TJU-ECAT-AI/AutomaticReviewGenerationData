<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The document appears to be about boron nitride nanosheets and their oxidation resistance, which is unrelated to the catalytic properties asked about in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot answer the question accurately.

给出的文献中没有任何与回答关于B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度的问题相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于氮化硼纳米片及其抗氧化性的,这与问题中询问的催化性质无关。由于提供的文本中没有相关信息,我无法准确回答这个问题。
