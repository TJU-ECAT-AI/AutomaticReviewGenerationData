[1] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."

[2] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."

[3] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units are not the active sites for ODHP, contrary to previous hypotheses. Instead, catalytically active materials contain aggregated boron sites that can restructure under reaction conditions.

The research suggests that active boron-based ODH catalysts require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, implying a preference for 2-D or 3-D structures over 1-D isolated sites. This understanding of the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of boron aggregation and connectivity in catalyst performance.

The study's findings direct future work towards understanding precisely which types of boron-boron interactions are required to form active ODH catalysts. This knowledge will be crucial in developing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, as it shifts the focus from isolated sites to more complex, interconnected boron structures.

硼基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。研究表明，与先前的假设相反，孤立的BO3单元并不是ODHP的活性位点。相反，具有催化活性的材料含有可在反应条件下重构的聚集硼位点。

研究表明，活性硼基ODH催化剂需要具有一定程度B-O-B连接的硼物种，这意味着相比1D孤立位点，2D或3D结构更受青睐。这种对这些位点的独特性质和反应机理的理解，通过强调硼的聚集和连接在催化剂性能中的重要性，有助于设计更高效的催化剂。

研究结果引导未来工作朝着理解precisely哪些类型的硼-硼相互作用是形成活性ODH催化剂所必需的方向发展。这一知识对于开发商业应用的更高效催化剂至关重要，因为它将关注点从孤立位点转移到更复杂的、相互连接的硼结构上。
