[1] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."

[2] "Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06)."

[3] "To understand the function of this oxidized boron phase, we recently investigated silica-supported boron oxide (B/SiO2) materials, which showed a similar conversion-selectivity trend and product distribution to the bulk boron-containing catalysts."

[4] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."

[5] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units are not the active sites for ODHP, contrary to previous hypotheses. Instead, the active sites require some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that a more complex, multi-dimensional structure is necessary for catalytic activity.

The research shows that active B-based ODH catalysts form an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface during reaction conditions. This phase consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups, represented by the formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06). This structure indicates that the active sites are not limited to 1-D configurations but likely involve 2-D or 3-D arrangements of boron atoms.

The study also highlights the dynamic nature of these active sites. Under reaction conditions (500°C), the boron oxide phase becomes highly dynamic, undergoing restructuring. This suggests that the dimensionality of the active sites may not be static but can change during the reaction process.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It shifts focus from isolated BO3 sites to more complex boron structures with B-O-B connectivity.
2. It emphasizes the importance of creating catalysts that can form and maintain the necessary amorphous boron oxide phase under reaction conditions.
3. It suggests that catalyst designs should consider the dynamic nature of the active sites and potentially incorporate features that promote beneficial restructuring during reactions.
4. It indicates that future catalyst development should focus on optimizing the spatial distribution and connectivity of boron sites rather than maximizing the number of isolated boron atoms.

These insights provide a foundation for developing new strategies in catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。研究表明，与先前的假设相反，孤立的BO3单元并非ODHP的活性位点。相反，活性位点需要一定程度的B-O-B连接，这表明更复杂的多维结构对催化活性是必要的。

研究显示，活性B基ODH催化剂在反应条件下在催化剂表面形成氧化的、无定形的硼相。这个相由具有不同数量羟基和桥接氧化物基团的三配位硼组成，用B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06)表示。这种结构表明活性位点不限于1-D构型，而可能涉及2-D或3-D的硼原子排列。

研究还强调了这些活性位点的动态性质。在反应条件下（500°C），硼氧化物相变得高度动态，经历重构。这表明活性位点的维度可能不是静态的，而是可以在反应过程中发生变化。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它将焦点从孤立的BO3位点转移到具有B-O-B连接的更复杂的硼结构上。
2. 它强调了创建能在反应条件下形成并维持必要的无定形硼氧化物相的催化剂的重要性。
3. 它表明催化剂设计应考虑活性位点的动态性质，并可能纳入在反应过程中促进有益重构的特征。
4. 它指出，未来的催化剂开发应侧重于优化硼位点的空间分布和连接性，而不是最大化孤立硼原子的数量。

这些见解为催化剂设计的新策略提供了基础，可能导致开发出更高效、更选择性的商业应用ODHP催化剂。

[2] "Boron-containing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes, have been shown to be highly selective catalysts for the transformation of light alkanes to olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)."

[3] "Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface.

[4] "The B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e. <0.5% conversion). This result was unexpected since a B/SiO2 catalyst with 0.23wt.% boron showed 92% total olefin selectivity at 4% propane conversion."

[5] "Taken together these observations suggest that some boron spins are distant from protons, likely due to the formation of some boron oxide clusters in B/B-MWW."

Instead, the catalytic activity appears to require some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that higher-dimensional structures (2-D or 3-D) are necessary for effective catalysis.

The research shows that active boron-based ODH catalysts typically form an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface, consisting of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It highlights the importance of boron clustering and connectivity in catalyst design, rather than focusing on isolated sites.

2. It suggests that catalyst preparation methods should aim to create or promote the formation of B-O-B connections, rather than dispersing boron atoms individually throughout a support material.

3. It indicates that the dynamic nature of the boron sites under reaction conditions is important, as the active amorphous boron phase forms during the reaction.

4. It emphasizes the need for further research into the specific types of boron-boron interactions required for optimal catalytic performance.

By understanding these factors, researchers can work towards developing catalysts with the right spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites to maximize ODHP performance, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalysts for commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units, such as those found in B-MWW zeolite, are not active for ODHP. Instead, catalytic activity requires some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that the active sites are not single isolated boron atoms but rather involve multiple boron atoms in close proximity.

The research shows that catalytically active materials like B/B-MWW and B/SiO2 contain a larger fraction of B(OSi)2(OH) sites and exhibit similar NMR parameters, indicating similar boron speciation. This suggests that the dimensionality of the active sites extends beyond single atoms to include at least 2-D structures with B-O-B bonds.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It directs research away from isolated boron sites and towards the development of catalysts with controlled aggregation of boron species.

2. It emphasizes the importance of creating materials with more uniform boron oxide speciation to better understand and optimize active site formation.

3. It suggests that catalyst design should focus on promoting the formation of B-O-B connectivity rather than maximizing the dispersion of individual boron atoms.

4. It highlights the need for further investigation into the specific types of boron-boron interactions required for active ODH catalysts.

By elucidating these structure-activity relationships, researchers can work towards developing catalysts with improved performance, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and economical processes for olefin production.
