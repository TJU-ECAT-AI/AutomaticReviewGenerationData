[1] "Although widely applied in industry, isomorphously substituted zeolites are still the subject of many ongoing studies."

[2] "Boron-containing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes, have been shown to be highly selective catalysts for the transformation of light alkanes to olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)."

[3] "Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06)."

[4] "The B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e. <0.5% conversion). This result was unexpected since a B/SiO2 catalyst with 0.23wt.% boron showed 92% total olefin selectivity at 4% propane conversion."

[5] "Taken together these observations suggest that some boron spins are distant from protons, likely due to the formation of some boron oxide clusters in B/B-MWW."

[6] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 sites, such as those found in B-MWW zeolites, are not active for ODHP reactions. Instead, the catalytic activity appears to require some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that higher-dimensional structures (2-D or 3-D) are necessary for effective catalysis.

The research shows that active boron-based ODH catalysts typically form an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface, consisting of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups. This structure allows for the formation of B-O-B connections, which are crucial for catalytic activity.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It highlights the importance of boron clustering and connectivity in catalyst design, rather than focusing on isolated sites.

2. It suggests that catalyst preparation methods should aim to create or promote the formation of B-O-B connections, rather than dispersing boron atoms individually throughout a support material.

3. It indicates that the dynamic nature of the boron sites under reaction conditions is important, as the active amorphous boron phase forms during the reaction.

4. It emphasizes the need for further research into the specific types of boron-boron interactions required for optimal catalytic performance.

By understanding these factors, researchers can work towards developing catalysts with the right spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites to maximize ODHP performance, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalysts for commercial applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。研究表明，B-MWW沸石中发现的孤立BO3位点对ODHP反应不活跃。相反，催化活性似乎需要一定程度的B-O-B连接，这表明更高维度的结构（2-D或3-D）对有效催化是必要的。

研究显示，活性硼基ODH催化剂通常在催化剂表面形成氧化的、无定形的硼相，由具有不同数量羟基和桥接氧化物基团的三配位硼组成。这种结构允许形成B-O-B连接，这对催化活性至关重要。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它强调了硼簇和连接性在催化剂设计中的重要性，而不是专注于孤立位点。

2. 它表明催化剂制备方法应该致力于创造或促进B-O-B连接的形成，而不是将硼原子分散在支撑材料中。

3. 它表明硼位点在反应条件下的动态特性很重要，因为活性无定形硼相是在反应过程中形成的。

4. 它强调了需要进一步研究最佳催化性能所需的特定类型的硼-硼相互作用。

通过理解这些因素，研究人员可以致力于开发具有适当空间分布和维度的活性位点的催化剂，以最大化ODHP性能，可能导致更高效和选择性的商业应用催化剂。
