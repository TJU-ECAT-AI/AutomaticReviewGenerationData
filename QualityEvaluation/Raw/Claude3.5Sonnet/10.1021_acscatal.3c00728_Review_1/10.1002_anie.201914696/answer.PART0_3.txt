[1] "Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06)."

[2] "The B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e. <0.5% conversion). This result was unexpected since a B/SiO2 catalyst with 0.23wt.% boron showed 92% total olefin selectivity at 4% propane conversion."

[3] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."

[4] "Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units, which are predominantly present in B-MWW zeolite, are not active for ODHP. Instead, the active sites require some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that a more aggregated or clustered arrangement of boron species is necessary for catalytic activity.

The research shows that catalytically active boron-based materials form an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface during ODHP reactions. This phase consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups. The presence of this phase, which likely has a higher dimensionality than isolated sites, appears to be crucial for catalytic activity.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by highlighting the importance of boron species aggregation and connectivity. This insight suggests that future catalyst designs should focus on creating materials with controlled boron clustering or specific B-O-B connectivities to enhance ODHP performance.

The study does not specifically address 1-D edge active sites, but it emphasizes the importance of moving beyond single-site catalysis to more complex boron arrangements for effective ODHP catalysts. This understanding can guide the development of new catalyst synthesis methods and structures that promote the formation of active boron species with optimal spatial distribution and dimensionality for improved catalytic performance in commercial ODHP applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。研究表明，B-MWW沸石中主要存在的孤立BO3单元对ODHP不活跃。相反，活性位点需要一定程度的B-O-B连接，这表明硼物种需要更聚集或成簇的排列才能具有催化活性。

研究显示，具有催化活性的硼基材料在ODHP反应过程中在催化剂表面形成氧化的、无定形的硼相。这个相由具有不同数量羟基和桥接氧化物基团的三配位硼组成。这个相的存在，可能具有比孤立位点更高的维度，似乎对催化活性至关重要。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，突出了硼物种聚集和连接的重要性。这一见解表明，未来的催化剂设计应该着重于创造具有可控硼聚集或特定B-O-B连接的材料，以增强ODHP性能。

虽然研究并未特别提及一维边缘活性位点，但它强调了超越单点催化、转向更复杂的硼排列对于有效ODHP催化剂的重要性。这一理解可以指导新的催化剂合成方法和结构的开发，促进形成具有最佳空间分布和维度的活性硼物种，从而提高商业ODHP应用中的催化性能。
