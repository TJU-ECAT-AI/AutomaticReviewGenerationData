The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units, such as those found in B-MWW zeolite, are not active for ODHP. Instead, catalytic activity requires some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that the active sites are not single isolated boron atoms but rather involve multiple boron atoms in close proximity.

The research shows that catalytically active materials like B/B-MWW and B/SiO2 contain a larger fraction of B(OSi)2(OH) sites and exhibit similar NMR parameters, indicating similar boron speciation. This suggests that the dimensionality of the active sites extends beyond single atoms to include at least 2-D structures with B-O-B bonds.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It directs research away from isolated boron sites and towards the development of catalysts with controlled aggregation of boron species.

2. It emphasizes the importance of creating materials with more uniform boron oxide speciation to better understand and optimize active site formation.

3. It suggests that catalyst design should focus on promoting the formation of B-O-B connectivity rather than maximizing the dispersion of individual boron atoms.

4. It highlights the need for further investigation into the specific types of boron-boron interactions required for active ODH catalysts.

By elucidating these structure-activity relationships, researchers can work towards developing catalysts with improved performance, selectivity, and stability for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and economical processes for olefin production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。研究表明，B-MWW沸石中发现的孤立BO3单元对ODHP不活跃。相反，催化活性需要一定程度的B-O-B连接，这表明活性位点不是单个孤立的硼原子，而是涉及多个相邻的硼原子。

研究显示，像B/B-MWW和B/SiO2这样的催化活性材料含有更大比例的B(OSi)2(OH)位点，并表现出相似的NMR参数，表明硼的物种分布相似。这表明活性位点的维度超出了单原子，至少包括具有B-O-B键的2-D结构。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它将研究方向从孤立的硼位点转向开发具有受控硼物种聚集的催化剂。

2. 它强调了创造硼氧化物物种分布更均匀的材料的重要性，以更好地理解和优化活性位点的形成。

3. 它表明催化剂设计应该集中在促进B-O-B连接的形成，而不是最大化单个硼原子的分散。

4. 它强调了需要进一步研究活性ODH催化剂所需的特定类型的硼-硼相互作用。

通过阐明这些结构-活性关系，研究人员可以致力于开发具有改进性能、选择性和稳定性的ODHP反应催化剂，可能会导致更高效和经济的烯烃生产工艺。
