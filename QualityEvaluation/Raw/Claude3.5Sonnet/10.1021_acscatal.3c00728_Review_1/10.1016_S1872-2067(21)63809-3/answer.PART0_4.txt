The literature does not directly address how different spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss the advantages of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) synthesized by electrospinning.

The one-dimensional structure of PBSN catalysts offers several benefits:

1. High dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
2. Improved olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in ODH reactions
3. Easy diffusion of reactants and products
4. High catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)

These properties suggest that the one-dimensional structure of PBSN catalysts contributes to their improved performance in ODH reactions. The open fiber structure likely provides better accessibility to active sites and facilitates mass transfer, which could explain the higher activity and selectivity observed.

While the document does not specifically discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites, the improved performance of PBSN catalysts indicates that understanding and optimizing one-dimensional structures could be valuable for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

To further advance catalyst design, future research could focus on:

1. Comparing the performance of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D boron-based catalysts in ODHP reactions
2. Investigating the specific role of edge active sites in one-dimensional structures
3. Optimizing the synthesis process to control the spatial distribution of active sites
4. Studying the reaction mechanisms on different types of active sites in various dimensionalities

文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的不同空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。但是，它确实讨论了通过静电纺丝合成的一维多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维(PBSN)的优点。

PBSN催化剂的一维结构提供了几个优势：

1. 硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纳米纤维框架上具有高分散性和稳定性
2. 在ODH反应中提高了烯烃选择性和催化稳定性
3. 反应物和产物的易扩散性
4. 在高重量小时空速(WHSV)下具有高催化活性

这些特性表明，PBSN催化剂的一维结构有助于提高其在ODH反应中的性能。开放的纤维结构可能提供了更好的活性位点可及性和物质传递，这可以解释观察到的更高活性和选择性。

虽然文档没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，但PBSN催化剂的性能改善表明，理解和优化一维结构对于设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂可能很有价值。

为了进一步推进催化剂设计，未来的研究可以集中在：

1. 比较一维、二维和三维硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中的性能
2. 研究一维结构中边缘活性位点的具体作用
3. 优化合成过程以控制活性位点的空间分布
4. 研究不同维度的各种类型活性位点上的反应机理
