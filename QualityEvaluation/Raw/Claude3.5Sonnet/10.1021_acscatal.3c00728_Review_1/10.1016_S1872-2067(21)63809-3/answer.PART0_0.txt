[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step. The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[2] "The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes."

[3] "The electrospinning synthesis of the catalyst ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of the boron species on the open silica fiber framework."

The literature discusses the synthesis and performance of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The spatial distribution and one-dimensional structure of active sites in these catalysts contribute to their improved performance in several ways:

1. Higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts.

2. Prevention of diffusion limitations due to the open pore structures of the one-dimensional nanofibers.

3. Guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).

4. Uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites, it suggests that the one-dimensional structure plays a crucial role in enhancing catalyst performance. Understanding these properties could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.

2. Utilizing the benefits of one-dimensional structures to improve diffusion and stability.

3. Exploring ways to further enhance the uniform dispersion of active species on the catalyst surface.

4. Developing synthesis methods that can precisely control the dimensionality and distribution of active sites.
