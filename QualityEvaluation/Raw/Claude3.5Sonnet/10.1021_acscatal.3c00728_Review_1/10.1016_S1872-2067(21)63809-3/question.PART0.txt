Electrospinning synthesis of porous boron-doped silica nanofibers for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
Abstract
The discovery of the high activity and selectivity of boron-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins has attracted significant attention in the exploration of a new method for the synthesis of highly active and selective catalysts. Herein, we describe the synthesis of porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSNs) 100150 nm in diameter by electrospinning and the study of their catalytic performance. The electrospinning synthesis of the catalyst ensures the uniform dispersion and stability of the boron species on the open silica fiber framework. The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts showed higher olefin selectivity and stability. The presence of SiOH groups in silica-supported boron catalysts may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH of propane. When the ODH conversion of ethane reached 44.3%, the selectivity and productivity of ethylene were 84% and 44.2% gcat1 s1, respectively. In the case of propane ODH, the conversion, selectivity of olefins, and productivity of propylene are 19.2%, 90%, and 76.6 μmol gcat1 s1, respectively. No significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred during 20 h of operation at a high WHSV of 84.6 h1. Transient analysis and kinetic experiments indicated that the activation of O2 was influenced by alkanes during the ODH reaction.

1. Introduction
Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry [
1
,
2
]. Traditionally, propylene and ethylene are mainly produced through the cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons and the multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins process, which involves extensive energy consumption and enormous carbon emissions [
3
,
4
,
5
]. The recent boom in shale gas production [
1
,
6
], which contains large amounts of light alkanes, has motivated the interest of on-purpose light olefins technologies. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes plays a pivotal role in on-purpose light olefin technologies, owing to favorable thermodynamics and absence of coking [
7
,
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
]. In the ODH of alkanes, traditional metal oxide catalysts (e.g., supported molybdenum and vanadium oxide catalysts) exhibiting good performances have been widely researched in the past few decades, but the selectivity control of olefins is still difficult because the electron acceptor of metal oxides easily reacts with electron-rich olefins, resulting in the formation of over-oxidation products (CO and CO2) [
13
,
14
,
15
].
Recent studies have discovered that boron-based catalysts are extremely active in the ODH processes of ethane and propane, opening up a new research direction in the selective cleavage of the CH bond of alkanes [
16
,
17
]. Boron-based catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity for alkanes and high selectivity to olefins with negligible formation of CO2 in ODH reactions, owing to the suppression of olefin overoxidation [
18
,
19
,
20
,
21
]. Extensive studies have shown that the unanticipated catalytic activity was attributed to the BO species (e.g., BO and BOH) of the boron-based catalysts [
17
,
22
,
23
,
24
,
25
,
26
]. B2O3, a chemically stable boride in an oxidizing atmosphere rich in BOH groups and BOB bridges [
27
], may constitute various structural units to adapt to the chemical environment under reaction conditions, which provides a promising option for the ODH of light alkanes.
Three-dimensional porous supports are often used to prepare B2O3 catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis reactions. For example, in the case of the ODH reaction, B2O3 was tentatively impregnated on various supports, for example, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, etc. [
28
,
29
,
30
]. Considering the structural flexibility and easily covalently implemented properties of B2O3, we need to develop an efficient synthesis of boron-based catalysts to achieve higher catalytic activity and stability in the ODH reaction.
Following this consideration, electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step. The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane. No significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred during the 20 h operation at a high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 84.6 h1. Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Boric acid (H3BO3), quartz powder, ethanol, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and commercial silica were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (P123) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). All chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
P123 was first dissolved in an aqueous-ethanol solution with a weight composition of 6(P123)/20(C2H5OH)/55(H2O); TEOS and H3BO3 were added to the P123 solution with a weight composition of 125(TEOS)/x(H3BO3)/30(P123) (x = 1, 2, 4), and stirred at room temperature for 1 h at pH = 2. Then, a PVA (10 wt%) solution was incorporated to obtain a transparent composite solution. The prepared composite solution was then transferred into a syringe with a needle connected to a high-voltage supply. The distance from the needle tip to the collector was fixed at 1520 cm at room temperature and in a N2 atmosphere. A potential of 914 kV was applied for the electrospinning. Finally, the PBSN catalysts were obtained by calcination of the materials in air at 650 C for 3 h. The materials are denoted as PBSN-1, PBSN-2, and PBSN-3, with B2O3 contents of 1.5 wt%, 3 wt%, and 6 wt%, respectively. For comparison, the supported catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using H3BO3 as a boron source and silica aerogel (surface area of 300 m2 g1), SBA-15, and quartz powder as supports for comparison. The concentration of H3BO3 in an ethylene glycol solution was matched to obtain 6 wt% of the total B2O3 content in the catalyst. Then the catalysts were obtained through the calcination of the precursors at 650 C for 3 h in air. The catalysts were named B2O3/gel, B2O3/SBA-15, and B2O3/QP, respectively. SBA-15 was synthesized according to literature [
31
].
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
The catalysts were loaded into a packed-bed quartz microreactor (I.D. = 8 mm) and held in the middle of the reactor tube using quartz wool (20 mg). The gas feed was alkanes/oxygen/nitrogen with a volume ratio of 1/1/2 in propane ODH reaction (Fw = 14.4 mL min1) and 1/1.5/3.5 in ethane ODH reaction (Fw = 9.6 mL min1) at 0.1 MPa. The WHSV was 12.8 h1 in the ethane ODH reaction and 84.6 h1 in the propane ODH reaction. The reactants and products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900). C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, O2, N2, CO, and CO2 were analyzed using GDX-102 and 5A molecular sieve columns connected to a thermal conductivity detector and a Plot Al2O3/S column connected to an flame ionization detector.
The conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon that reacted. The carbon balance was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream divided by the number of moles of carbon in the feed. During the evaluation conditions, the carbon balance was maintained within 100%  5%. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard to eliminate the errors caused by volume expansion.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on an FEI TECNAI F30 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an XPert-3 Powder diffractometer and a Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). After grinding, the powder catalyst was placed inside a quartz glass sample holder before testing. Thermogravimetric (TG) profiles were measured from 40 to 1000 C at a heating rate of 10 C min1 under air flow, using a STA449 F3 Jupiter TG analyzer (Netzsch).
Nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured using a Tristar 3000 sorption analyzer (Micromeritics). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to calculate specific surface areas. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 spectrometer by dispersing the samples in KBr pellets. Before the diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) test, all catalysts were dehydrated in situ at 200 C for 1 h in a helium atmosphere.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an Omicron Sphera II hemispherical electron energy analyzer connected to an in situ reaction cell. A monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV, anode operating at 15 kV and 300 W) was used as the incident radiation. Before the measurements, all the samples were treated in situ at 500 C for 1 h under an Ar stream (32 mL min1) and then moved to the measurement chamber under vacuum conditions.
11B magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (11B MAS NMR) spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer with an 11.7 T magnet and a Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer with a 14.1 T magnet, using a 4-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. Quantitative 1D MAS 11B one pulse NMR spectra acquired at 14.1 T were obtained with a small flip angle of π/12 at the corresponding 11B r. f. field of approximately 36 kHz with a recycle delay of 2 s. The chemical shifts were referenced to a 1 M H3BO3 aqueous solution at 19.6 ppm. Before testing, the sample was dehydrated at 400 C for 1 h at 1 × 104 Pa and then transferred to a 4-mm MAS rotor in an in-house device without exposure to air.
2.5. Transient analysis
Transient analysis experiments were performed in a packed-bed single-pass flow microreactor. The chemical composition of the reactor effluent was measured using online mass spectrometry (MS). The spent catalyst was first heated to 600 C under He atmosphere (50 mL min1); different reactants were then directly pulsed into the catalyst using He as the carrier gas and the products were recorded by MS analysis. The following mass-to-charge (m/z) signals were analyzed: 29 (C2H6), 24 (C2H4), and 18 (H2O).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Insights in the micro- and nanostructures of the PBSN catalysts
PBSN catalysts with different B2O3 contents were obtained by electrospinning followed by calcination in air. The SEM images of one representative sample (PBSN-3) (Figs. 1(a) and (b)) showed a fibrous structure, and the diameters of the fibers were in the range of 100150 nm. Similar fiber structures were also observed for the PBSN-1 and PBSN-2 catalysts (Fig. S1). The TEM image of PBSN-3 (
Fig. 1(c)
) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst (
Fig. 1(d)
).

The N2 physical sorption isotherms of the PBSN catalysts (
Fig. 2(a)
) showed a type-IV shape, indicating their accessible mesoporous characteristics. The surface areas of the PBSN-1, PBSN-2, and PBSN-3 catalysts were 88, 98, and 96 m2 g1, respectively. The pore sizes of the PBSN catalysts obtained from the BJH adsorption branches were uniformly concentrated at approximately 4 nm (
Fig. 2(b)
). The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts in
Fig. 2(c)
show a broad reflection in the 2θ range of 1529, which is attributed to the amorphous nature of SiO2. B2O3 signals were not observed, suggesting that the B2O3 species may be highly dispersed in the fiber structure, together with the results of STEM-EDX mapping.

FTIR analysis (
Fig. 2(d)
) of the PBSN catalysts was performed to further characterize their chemical structures. The broad absorption peaks in the region of 13001000 cm1 are caused by the SiO and BO stretches [
32
]. The peaks at 1425 and 1370 cm1 correspond to the signals of trigonal BO3 units [
33
]. No significant signals of tetrahedral BO4 units were detected, suggesting that the BO species were primarily tri-coordinated boron species immobilized on these catalysts. The bending of the BOSi peak was detected at 920 cm1 [
32
], indicating that the BO species were bridged by chemical bonds in the catalysts. The structural characterization of the control sample B2O3/gel is shown in Fig. S2. In the XRD pattern, the B2O3 signal can be detected, indicating that the supported catalyst allows the aggregation of B2O3. FTIR spectroscopy showed the signal of trigonal BO3 units at 1425 cm1, but no evident BOSi peak was observed. This result suggests that the BO3 group existed in the B2O3/gel catalyst but had weak bonding to the support.
3.2. Catalytic performance of PBSN catalysts in ODH of ethane and propane
The reaction rates of propane on the PBSN catalysts were also tested (Fig. S3). The activity of the catalysts increased linearly with the increase in the B2O3 content, suggesting that the diffusion limitation was removed under the reaction conditions.
Fig. 3
shows the catalytic performance of the typical catalyst PBSN-3 in the ODH of propane and ethane. In the case of ethane (Figs. 3(a) and (b)), the selectivity to ethylene was 91.5% at 26.1% ethane conversion, and the byproduct consisted of CO (6.9%) and CO2 (1.6%) at 595 C. As the conversion of ethane was increased to 44.3% at 600 C, the selectivity of ethylene was still retained at 84% with an ethylene productivity up to 44.2 μmol gcat1 s1 (Table S1). The catalytic activity was essentially constant for the PBSN-3 catalyst over a 12 h stability test at 595 C, but it was gradually reduced over the B2O3/gel catalyst, implying that the activity sites were much more stable on the PBSN-3 catalyst.

In the case of propane (Figs. 3(c) and (d)), the product slate consisted of C3H6, C2H4, CO, CO2, and a negligible quantity of CH4. When the conversion reached 19.2% at 545 C, the selectivity of propylene was 74.5% and up to 90% for olefins (C3H6 and C2H4), whereas the productivity of propylene reached as high as 76.6 μmol gcat1 s1 (Table S1). Compared to supported boron oxide catalysts and traditional metal-based catalysts, the PBSN-3 catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity (Fig. S4). Moreover, the stability test of the PBSN-3 catalyst at 545 C with a high WHSV of 84.6 h1 showed no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity over 20 h, indicating that the catalytic activity was stable even at high space velocity.
Fig. 4
shows the dependence of propylene selectivity on propane conversion over PBSN-3 and B2O3/gel catalysts. Although different catalysts have similar lines of the conversion-selectivity trend, the PBSN-3 catalyst showed higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/gel. A previous study demonstrated that silica-supported boron oxide catalysts present lower propylene selectivity than h-BN owing to the negative effect of silica support [
29
,
30
]. The current high propylene selectivity suggested that the negative effect of silica was inhibited on the PBSN-3 catalyst.

The DRIFT spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S5(a). Before the test, all catalysts were dehydrated in situ at 200 C for 1 h in a helium atmosphere. The spectra showed that the Si-OH signal intensity of the B2O3/gel catalyst was stronger than that of the PBSN-3 catalyst. TG analysis was also consistent with the DRIFT results (Fig. S5(b)). Considering that the hydroxyl groups and defect sites contained in silica materials can influence or catalyze the reaction process [
34
,
35
,
36
], it is reasonable to speculate that the SiOH group may cause low propylene selectivity during the ODH reaction over boron-based catalysts. To further confirm this speculation, SBA-15 (rich in SiOH groups) and quartz powder (poor in SiOH groups) were also used as supports to load B2O3. Interestingly, the B2O3/QP catalyst showed a higher propylene selectivity than B2O3/SBA-15 (Fig. S6). This result strongly supports this speculation. Research has shown that a radical reaction occurs in the ODH reaction over boron-based catalysts [
2
,
22
,
37
]. Certain SiOH groups on the surface of silica can form Si-O• species at high temperatures (> 400 C) [
38
,
39
]. Therefore, one of the speculated reasons is that Si-O• species may bond with alkyl radicals, making it easier to react with oxygen species to produce over-oxidation products, leading to lower propylene selectivity.
3.3. Structural stability of PBSN catalysts
After the catalytic test, the structure of the PBSN catalyst was further characterized using various techniques. The SEM and TEM characterization (Figs. 5(a)(d)) of the spent PBSN-3 catalyst showed that the porous fibrous structure was well maintained after the ODH reaction. The N2 sorption isotherms of the spent catalyst exhibited a nearly identical shape to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig. S8), suggesting that the porous structure of the PBSN-3 catalyst is stable during the ODH reaction. The FTIR spectra of the spent PBSN-3 catalyst (Fig. S9) presented unchanged characteristic peaks of trigonal BO3 units, SiOB, and SiO, indicating that the catalyst framework and BO species were stable during the ODH reaction. XPS measurements confirmed the presence of boron, silicon, and oxygen elements in both fresh and spent PBSN-3 catalysts, and the surface elemental compositions of the catalysts were almost identical before and after the ODH reactions (
Table 1
).

The 11B NMR measurements for the PBSN-3 catalysts are shown in
Fig. 6
, and five types of B species were identified with the chemical shifts at ca. 17.8, 14.5, 12.5, 0, and 2 ppm, respectively. The detailed structures of the five types of B species are shown in Fig. S10. All 11B NMR spectra showed broad and overlapping signals due to quadrupolar interactions. The quadrupolar coupling constants (CQ) of three types of tri-coordinated boron species were 2.52.6 MHz [
30
,
40
,
41
,
42
] and the tetra-coordinated boron species showed the Gaussian-Lorentz line feature. The three tri-coordinated boron species were assigned to the boroxol ring B3O9/2 (B[
3a
] species), non-ring BO3/2 (B[
3b
] species), and tri-coordinated planar B species (B[
3c
] species) [
30
]. The two species at the up-field side were assigned to two tetra-coordinated tetrahedral boron anionic species (B[
4a
] and B[
4b
] species), which were fused into the silica matrix. The boron species of the B2O3/gel catalyst were similar to those of the PBSN-3 catalyst, as shown in Fig. S12.

The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via BOSi bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results. Based on previous research, the B[
3a
] and B[
3b
] species are attributed to the active species for the ODH of alkanes [
30
]. Regarding the supported catalysts, the boron species are subjected to dynamic evolution under ODH conditions, leading to a change in catalytic activity during the reaction [
29
,
30
]. The boron species were almost unchanged in the PBSN-3 catalyst, suggesting that they were stably immobilized on the PBSN catalyst compared to the supported ones.
3.4. Transient analysis and kinetic experiments
Considering the uniform and stable catalyst structure, the PBSN material could be used as a model boron-based catalyst to better understand the reaction behavior of the ODH reaction. First, a transient analysis of the products was performed by MS experiments. The catalyst was heated to 600 C under a helium atmosphere, after which different reactants were directly pulsed into the reaction chamber using a helium carrier; the products were then recorded by MS analysis. As shown in
Fig. 7(a)
, when C2H6 was directly pulsed into the catalyst, no C2H4 signal was detected during the pulses, suggesting that the PBSN catalyst was unreactive for ethane dehydrogenation only. However, ethylene was formed immediately when a mixture of oxygen and ethane was pulsed into the chamber (
Fig. 7(b)
). These objective results allowed us to conclude that PBSN can play the catalytic role in ethane to ethylene conversion only with the assistance of oxygen.

Kinetic experiments were performed to gain further insight into the reaction pathway of light alkane ODH over the PBSN catalyst. The effect of the alkane and oxygen concentrations on the reaction rate over the PBSN-3 catalyst is shown in
Fig. 8
. The rate expressions for ethane and propane consumption, Eqs. (1) and (2), are given below:

Similar kinetic behaviors were also observed in the ODH of ethane and propane, suggesting that the light alkanes converted by the PBSN catalyst were subjected to an analogous reaction mechanism. The reaction order of oxygen approached 0.5 in both the ODH of ethane and propane (Figs. 8(b) and (d)), suggesting that molecular oxygen may dissociate on the surface of the catalyst. However, the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the conversion of oxygen in the ODH of ethane (298 kJ mol1) was higher than that of propane (230 kJ mol1) (Fig. S13). This result implied that the activation of molecular oxygen was not only influenced by the catalyst but also by alkanes. Previous work has also found that the presence of alkanes can promote molecular oxygen dissociation on boron-based catalysts [
20
,
43
]. Therefore, the difference in Ea of oxygen conversion in the ODH of ethane and propane may originate from the different promoting abilities of ethane and propane [
18
]. The near-second-order dependence of ethane and propane concentrations suggests that the reaction rate is highly dependent on the partial pressure of light alkanes.
4. Conclusions
Electrospinning was used to synthesize porous boron-doped silica nanofibers, and their catalytic performance in the ODH of ethane and propane was investigated. The synthesized catalyst ensures uniform dispersion and stability of the boron species on the surface of the open fiber framework in ODH processes. The open one-dimensional fiber structure allows easy diffusion and ensures high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the ODH of alkanes. Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts showed higher olefin selectivity and stability. Transient analysis and kinetic experiments indicated that the activation of O2 was influenced by alkanes during the ODH reaction. This work offers a new approach for the synthesis of highly efficient boron-based catalysts and provides detailed experimental evidence for understanding the ODH reaction pathway over boron-based catalysts.
