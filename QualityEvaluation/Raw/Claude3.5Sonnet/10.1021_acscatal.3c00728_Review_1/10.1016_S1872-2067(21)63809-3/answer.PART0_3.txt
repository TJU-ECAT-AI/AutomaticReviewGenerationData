The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss the benefits of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) synthesized by electrospinning. These 1D nanofibers showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in ODH reactions compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. 

The unique 1D structure of PBSN catalysts offers several advantages:

1. High dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
2. Prevention of diffusion limitations
3. High catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)

While the document does not explicitly discuss the reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites, it suggests that the open pore structure and high dispersion of boron species contribute to the improved performance. This understanding can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by focusing on creating 1D structures with well-dispersed active sites and open pore structures to enhance mass transfer and catalytic activity.

The document does not provide information on 2D or 3D structures for comparison, nor does it discuss specific reaction mechanisms of edge active sites. Further research would be needed to fully address the question's scope regarding the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality across 1D, 2D, and 3D structures on ODHP performance.

该文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。然而，它确实讨论了通过静电纺丝合成的一维多孔掺硼二氧化硅纳米纤维(PBSN)的优点。与其他负载型氧化硼催化剂相比，这些一维纳米纤维在ODH反应中表现出更高的烯烃选择性和催化稳定性。

PBSN催化剂的独特一维结构提供了几个优势：

1. 硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纳米纤维框架上高度分散和稳定
2. 防止扩散限制
3. 在高重量小时空速(WHSV)下具有高催化活性

虽然该文档没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点的反应机理，但它表明开放的孔结构和硼物种的高分散性有助于提高性能。这种理解可以指导设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，重点是创建具有高度分散活性位点和开放孔结构的一维结构，以增强物质传递和催化活性。

该文档没有提供2D或3D结构的对比信息，也没有讨论边缘活性位点的具体反应机理。需要进一步研究才能全面解答问题中关于1D、2D和3D结构的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能影响的范围。
