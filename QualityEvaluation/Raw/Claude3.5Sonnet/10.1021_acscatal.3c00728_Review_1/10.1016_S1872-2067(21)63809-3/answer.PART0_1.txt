The spatial distribution and one-dimensional structure of active sites in the PBSN catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The electrospinning synthesis method ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework. This one-dimensional fiber structure allows for easy diffusion and high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes.

The unique properties of these one-dimensional edge active sites contribute to higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts. Understanding these reaction mechanisms can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by focusing on creating similar one-dimensional structures with highly dispersed and stable active sites.

While the document does not explicitly discuss 2-D and 3-D structures for comparison, it emphasizes the benefits of the 1-D structure in terms of diffusion, stability, and catalytic performance. This suggests that optimizing the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites is crucial for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts.

PBSN催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和一维结构显著影响了它们在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。电纺丝合成方法确保了硼物种在开放的硅纳米纤维框架上的高度分散和稳定性。这种一维纤维结构允许易于扩散，并在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中在高质量空速(WHSV)下保持高催化活性。

这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质与其他负载型硼氧化物催化剂相比，贡献了更高的烯烃选择性和催化稳定性。理解这些反应机制可以通过专注于创建类似的具有高度分散和稳定活性位点的一维结构，来设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。

虽然文档没有明确讨论2-D和3-D结构以进行比较，但它强调了1-D结构在扩散、稳定性和催化性能方面的优势。这表明，优化活性位点的空间分布和维度对于开发更高效的ODHP催化剂至关重要。
