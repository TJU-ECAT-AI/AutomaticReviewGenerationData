[1] "Our previous work revealed that oxygen-containing boron species at the surface of boron nitride are critical to their superior catalytic performance"

[2] "Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH."

[3] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized. Fig. 1 ac showed the SEM images of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 catalysts, and the BZEO zeolites were composed of intergrown, randomly-oriented, flaky crystals with particles of about 12 μm in length and around 100 nm in thickness."

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites, which are 2D structures. These catalysts showed good performance in ODHP reactions, suggesting that 2D distributions of active sites can be effective.

The active sites were identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) on the surface of the catalyst. This indicates that surface-accessible active sites are important for ODHP reactions.

The catalyst particles were described as flaky crystals with specific dimensions, implying that the spatial arrangement of active sites may play a role in catalyst performance.

While the study does not explicitly compare 1D, 2D, and 3D distributions of active sites, it demonstrates that understanding the nature and location of active sites (in this case, surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species) is crucial for designing efficient ODHP catalysts.

The study does not specifically address 1D edge active sites or their unique properties and reaction mechanisms. However, the importance of surface-accessible boron species suggests that edge sites could potentially play a significant role in catalyst performance, warranting further investigation.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, this research indicates that focusing on creating and optimizing surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species in layered structures could be a promising approach. Further studies comparing different spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites would be beneficial for advancing catalyst design for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

研究重点关注层状硼硅分子筛，这是2D结构。这些催化剂在ODHP反应中表现良好，表明活性位点的2D分布可能是有效的。

活性位点被确定为催化剂表面的缺陷三配位硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b）。这表明表面可接触的活性位点对ODHP反应很重要。

催化剂颗粒被描述为具有特定尺寸的片状晶体，这意味着活性位点的空间排列可能在催化剂性能中起作用。

虽然该研究没有明确比较活性位点的1D、2D和3D分布，但它表明了解活性位点的性质和位置（在本例中为表面可接触的缺陷三配位硼物种）对设计高效ODHP催化剂至关重要。

该研究没有特别关注1D边缘活性位点或其独特的性质和反应机制。然而，表面可接触硼物种的重要性表明，边缘位点可能在催化剂性能中起重要作用，值得进一步研究。

为了设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，这项研究表明，专注于在层状结构中创建和优化表面可接触的缺陷三配位硼物种可能是一种有前景的方法。进一步比较活性位点的不同空间分布和维度的研究将有利于推进ODHP反应的催化剂设计。

[3] "The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide some relevant information:

The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites as catalysts for ODHP. These materials have a 2D structure, consisting of flaky crystals about 1-2 μm in length and 100 nm in thickness. The active sites are identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) within this layered structure.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss 1D edge active sites or compare different dimensionalities, the use of a 2D layered structure likely provides high accessibility to the active boron sites. This could contribute to the catalyst's effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

The study doesn't directly address how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the identification of specific boron species responsible for activity provides a foundation for further catalyst design and optimization.

To fully answer the question about the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality on ODHP performance, additional research comparing catalysts with different structures (1D, 2D, and 3D) would be needed.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。但是，它提供了一些相关信息：

研究重点是层状硼硅沸石作为ODHP的催化剂。这些材料具有2D结构，由长约1-2μm、厚约100nm的片状晶体组成。活性位点被确定为这种层状结构中的缺陷三角形硼物种(B[3]a和B[3]b)。

虽然论文没有明确讨论1D边缘活性位点或比较不同维度，但2D层状结构的使用可能提供了对活性硼位点的高可及性。这可能有助于催化剂在ODHP反应中的有效性。

该研究没有直接阐述理解这些性质如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，识别出负责活性的特定硼物种为进一步的催化剂设计和优化提供了基础。

要全面回答空间分布和维度对ODHP性能影响的问题，需要进行额外的研究，比较具有不同结构（1D、2D和3D）的催化剂。

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about the structure and active sites of the borosilicate zeolite catalysts studied.

The catalysts synthesized were layered borosilicate zeolites with a 2D sheet-like structure. They were composed of randomly-oriented, flaky crystals about 1-2 μm in length and 100 nm thick. This 2D lamellar structure likely provides good accessibility to active sites.

The active sites for propane ODH were identified as defective trigonal boron species, specifically B[3]a and B[3]b. These are likely located on the surface or edges of the 2D zeolite sheets. The abundance of these defective trigonal boron sites correlated with catalytic activity.

While not explicitly discussed, the 2D sheet-like structure with exposed edge sites containing the active boron species may contribute to the good performance observed. The layered structure could provide a high density of accessible active sites compared to 3D structures.

However, the study does not compare 1D, 2D and 3D catalysts or discuss how dimensionality impacts performance. More research comparing B-based catalysts with different spatial distributions of active sites would be needed to fully address the question and inform catalyst design for commercial applications.

这篇文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度(1D、2D和3D)如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。然而,它确实提供了一些关于所研究的硼硅沸石催化剂结构和活性位点的相关信息。

合成的催化剂是具有二维片状结构的层状硼硅沸石。它们由随机取向的片状晶体组成,长度约为1-2微米,厚度为100纳米。这种2D层状结构可能为活性位点提供了良好的可及性。

丙烷ODH的活性位点被确定为缺陷型三配位硼物种,特别是B[3]a和B[3]b。这些位点可能位于2D沸石片的表面或边缘。这些缺陷型三配位硼位点的丰度与催化活性相关。

虽然没有明确讨论,但含有活性硼物种的2D片状结构和暴露的边缘位点可能有助于观察到的良好性能。与3D结构相比,层状结构可能提供更高密度的可接触活性位点。

然而,该研究并未比较1D、2D和3D催化剂,也未讨论维度如何影响性能。需要进行更多比较具有不同活性位点空间分布的B基催化剂的研究,以全面回答这个问题并为商业应用的催化剂设计提供信息。

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide some relevant information:

The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites, which are 2D structures. The active sites for propane ODH were identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b). These sites are likely distributed throughout the 2D layered structure of the zeolite.

The spatial distribution of these active sites in a 2D layered structure may contribute to their effectiveness by providing good accessibility to reactants. The 2D nature of the catalyst could potentially offer advantages over 3D structures in terms of mass transfer and active site exposure.

While the study does not specifically discuss 1D edge active sites, the layered structure of the zeolite implies the presence of edges, which could play a role in catalytic activity. However, this is not explicitly investigated in the given literature.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 2D distributed active sites in borosilicate zeolites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of defective trigonal boron species and their accessibility in layered structures. This knowledge could guide the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications by focusing on optimizing the distribution and exposure of these specific active sites.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些相关信息：

研究集中在层状硼硅沸石上，这是一种2D结构。丙烷ODH的活性位点被确定为缺陷型三配位硼物种(B[3]a和B[3]b)。这些位点可能分布在沸石的2D层状结构中。

这些活性位点在2D层状结构中的空间分布可能通过提供良好的反应物可及性来贡献其有效性。催化剂的2D性质可能在质量传递和活性位点暴露方面比3D结构具有优势。

虽然研究没有特别讨论1D边缘活性位点，但沸石的层状结构暗示了边缘的存在，这可能在催化活性中发挥作用。然而，在给定的文献中并未明确研究这一点。

了解硼硅沸石中这些2D分布活性位点的性质和反应机理，有助于催化剂设计，强调了缺陷型三配位硼物种及其在层状结构中的可及性的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂，重点是优化这些特定活性位点的分布和暴露。
