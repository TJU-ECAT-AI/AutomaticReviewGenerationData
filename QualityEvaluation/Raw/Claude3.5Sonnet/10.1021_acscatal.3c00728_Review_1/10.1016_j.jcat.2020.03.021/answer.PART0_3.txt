The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide some relevant information:

The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites, which are 2D structures. The active sites for propane ODH were identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b). These sites are likely distributed throughout the 2D layered structure of the zeolite.

The spatial distribution of these active sites in a 2D layered structure may contribute to their effectiveness by providing good accessibility to reactants. The 2D nature of the catalyst could potentially offer advantages over 3D structures in terms of mass transfer and active site exposure.

While the study does not specifically discuss 1D edge active sites, the layered structure of the zeolite implies the presence of edges, which could play a role in catalytic activity. However, this is not explicitly investigated in the given literature.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 2D distributed active sites in borosilicate zeolites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of defective trigonal boron species and their accessibility in layered structures. This knowledge could guide the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications by focusing on optimizing the distribution and exposure of these specific active sites.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些相关信息：

研究集中在层状硼硅沸石上，这是一种2D结构。丙烷ODH的活性位点被确定为缺陷型三配位硼物种(B[3]a和B[3]b)。这些位点可能分布在沸石的2D层状结构中。

这些活性位点在2D层状结构中的空间分布可能通过提供良好的反应物可及性来贡献其有效性。催化剂的2D性质可能在质量传递和活性位点暴露方面比3D结构具有优势。

虽然研究没有特别讨论1D边缘活性位点，但沸石的层状结构暗示了边缘的存在，这可能在催化活性中发挥作用。然而，在给定的文献中并未明确研究这一点。

了解硼硅沸石中这些2D分布活性位点的性质和反应机理，有助于催化剂设计，强调了缺陷型三配位硼物种及其在层状结构中的可及性的重要性。这些知识可以指导开发更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂，重点是优化这些特定活性位点的分布和暴露。
