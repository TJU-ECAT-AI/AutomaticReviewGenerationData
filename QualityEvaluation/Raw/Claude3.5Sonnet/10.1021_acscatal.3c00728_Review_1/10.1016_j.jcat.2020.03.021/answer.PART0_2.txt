[1] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

[2] "Fig. 1 ac showed the SEM images of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 catalysts, and the BZEO zeolites were composed of intergrown, randomly-oriented, flaky crystals with particles of about 12 μm in length and around 100 nm in thickness."

[3] "TEM image further revealed that the lamellar zeolite consisted of rectilinear sheets with a clear crystallized structure"

[4] "Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH."

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about the structure and active sites of the borosilicate zeolite catalysts studied.

The catalysts synthesized were layered borosilicate zeolites with a 2D sheet-like structure. They were composed of randomly-oriented, flaky crystals about 1-2 μm in length and 100 nm thick. This 2D lamellar structure likely provides good accessibility to active sites.

The active sites for propane ODH were identified as defective trigonal boron species, specifically B[3]a and B[3]b. These are likely located on the surface or edges of the 2D zeolite sheets. The abundance of these defective trigonal boron sites correlated with catalytic activity.

While not explicitly discussed, the 2D sheet-like structure with exposed edge sites containing the active boron species may contribute to the good performance observed. The layered structure could provide a high density of accessible active sites compared to 3D structures.

However, the study does not compare 1D, 2D and 3D catalysts or discuss how dimensionality impacts performance. More research comparing B-based catalysts with different spatial distributions of active sites would be needed to fully address the question and inform catalyst design for commercial applications.

这篇文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度(1D、2D和3D)如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。然而,它确实提供了一些关于所研究的硼硅沸石催化剂结构和活性位点的相关信息。

合成的催化剂是具有二维片状结构的层状硼硅沸石。它们由随机取向的片状晶体组成,长度约为1-2微米,厚度为100纳米。这种2D层状结构可能为活性位点提供了良好的可及性。

丙烷ODH的活性位点被确定为缺陷型三配位硼物种,特别是B[3]a和B[3]b。这些位点可能位于2D沸石片的表面或边缘。这些缺陷型三配位硼位点的丰度与催化活性相关。

虽然没有明确讨论,但含有活性硼物种的2D片状结构和暴露的边缘位点可能有助于观察到的良好性能。与3D结构相比,层状结构可能提供更高密度的可接触活性位点。

然而,该研究并未比较1D、2D和3D催化剂,也未讨论维度如何影响性能。需要进行更多比较具有不同活性位点空间分布的B基催化剂的研究,以全面回答这个问题并为商业应用的催化剂设计提供信息。
