The given literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites as catalysts for ODHP, but does not discuss 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D active sites or their influence on catalyst performance. The paper identifies defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) as the likely active sites, but does not explore their spatial distribution or dimensionality. Therefore, this specific question cannot be fully answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。该研究主要关注层状硼硅沸石作为ODHP的催化剂,但没有讨论一维、二维或三维活性位点及其对催化剂性能的影响。文章确定了缺陷型三配位硼物种(B[3]a和B[3]b)可能是活性位点,但并未探讨它们的空间分布或维度。因此,基于给定文献中提供的信息,无法全面回答这个具体问题。
