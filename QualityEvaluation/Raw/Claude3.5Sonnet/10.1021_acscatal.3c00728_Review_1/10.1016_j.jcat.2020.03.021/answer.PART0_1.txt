[1] "Inspired by the previous studies, besides boron nitride, thermally stable silicon boride has also been proved as the active catalyst for ODH"

[2] "Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH."

[3] "The catalytic active sites were attributed to the abundant of defective trigonal boron structures."

[4] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

[5] "the BZEO zeolites were composed of intergrown, randomly-oriented, flaky crystals with particles of about 12 μm in length and around 100 nm in thickness."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide some relevant information:

The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites as catalysts for ODHP. These materials have a 2D structure, consisting of flaky crystals about 1-2 μm in length and 100 nm in thickness. The active sites are identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) within this layered structure.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss 1D edge active sites or compare different dimensionalities, the use of a 2D layered structure likely provides high accessibility to the active boron sites. This could contribute to the catalyst's effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

The study doesn't directly address how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the identification of specific boron species responsible for activity provides a foundation for further catalyst design and optimization.

To fully answer the question about the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality on ODHP performance, additional research comparing catalysts with different structures (1D, 2D, and 3D) would be needed.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。但是，它提供了一些相关信息：

研究重点是层状硼硅沸石作为ODHP的催化剂。这些材料具有2D结构，由长约1-2μm、厚约100nm的片状晶体组成。活性位点被确定为这种层状结构中的缺陷三角形硼物种(B[3]a和B[3]b)。

虽然论文没有明确讨论1D边缘活性位点或比较不同维度，但2D层状结构的使用可能提供了对活性硼位点的高可及性。这可能有助于催化剂在ODHP反应中的有效性。

该研究没有直接阐述理解这些性质如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，识别出负责活性的特定硼物种为进一步的催化剂设计和优化提供了基础。

要全面回答空间分布和维度对ODHP性能影响的问题，需要进行额外的研究，比较具有不同结构（1D、2D和3D）的催化剂。
