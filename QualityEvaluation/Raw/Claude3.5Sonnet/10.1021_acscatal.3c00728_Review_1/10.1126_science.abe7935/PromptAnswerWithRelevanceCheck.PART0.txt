The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature describes a novel catalyst, BS-1, with isolated boron species in a 3-D MFI zeolite framework, which differs from conventional catalysts containing BOB oligomers.

The active sites in BS-1 are uniformly distributed throughout the silica matrix, as revealed by energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental mapping. This uniform distribution likely contributes to the catalyst's high performance by maximizing the accessibility of reactants to active sites.

The unique B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure of the active sites in BS-1 plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. This structure, identified through advanced characterization techniques like NMR spectroscopy, provides isolated boron species that are more effective for ODHP compared to the BOB oligomers found in conventional catalysts.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It demonstrates the importance of site isolation in preventing overoxidation and improving selectivity.

2. It highlights the role of the zeolite framework in stabilizing active sites and preventing their deactivation through hydrolysis.

3. It shows how the specific coordination environment of boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) can be tuned to enhance catalytic performance.

4. It illustrates the potential of incorporating boron sites into structured materials like zeolites to create catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and durability.

While the literature does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, the insights gained from this 3-D zeolite-based catalyst can inform the design of catalysts with various dimensionalities. The key principles of site isolation, controlled coordination environment, and structural stability can be applied to develop catalysts with 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D architectures, each potentially offering unique advantages for specific applications in ODHP or other reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。文献描述了一种新型催化剂BS-1，它在3-D MFI沸石骨架中具有孤立的硼物种，这与含有BOB寡聚体的传统催化剂不同。

BS-1中的活性位点在二氧化硅基质中均匀分布，这一点通过能量色散光谱元素映射得到证实。这种均匀分布可能通过最大化反应物对活性位点的可及性来提高催化剂的性能。

BS-1中活性位点独特的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构在其催化活性中起着关键作用。这种结构通过核磁共振波谱等先进表征技术识别，提供了比传统催化剂中的BOB寡聚体更有效的孤立硼物种用于ODHP反应。

理解这些孤立硼位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它证明了位点隔离在防止过度氧化和提高选择性方面的重要性。

2. 它强调了沸石骨架在稳定活性位点和防止其通过水解失活方面的作用。

3. 它展示了如何调整硼的特定配位环境（B[OHO(H)Si]2）以提高催化性能。

4. 它说明了将硼位点引入沸石等结构化材料的潜力，以创造具有改进的活性、选择性和耐久性的催化剂。

虽然文献没有具体讨论1-D边缘活性位点，但从这种3-D沸石基催化剂获得的见解可以指导各种维度催化剂的设计。位点隔离、可控配位环境和结构稳定性等关键原理可应用于开发具有1-D、2-D或3-D架构的催化剂，每种架构都可能为ODHP或其他反应的特定应用提供独特优势。

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it provides insights into the unique properties of isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks, which can be considered as 0-D or single-site catalysts.

The study challenges the previous understanding that BOB oligomers (which could be considered as 1-D or 2-D structures) are the active centers for ODHP, while single-site boron in zeolites is inert. Instead, it reports a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1), containing only isolated boron species.

These isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework, particularly the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, exhibit high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The spatial isolation of these sites prevents the formation of BOB oligomers and contributes to the catalyst's stability and water tolerance.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by demonstrating that:

1. Single-site catalysts can be highly active and selective for ODHP.
2. The coordination environment of boron sites can be tuned to improve catalytic performance.
3. Incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework can provide both high activity and excellent durability.

This new understanding of isolated boron sites opens up opportunities for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, potentially leading to more scalable applications in commercial ODHP processes.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响，但它提供了关于沸石框架中孤立硼位点独特性质的见解，这些可以被视为0-D或单位点催化剂。

这项研究挑战了先前认为BOB寡聚体（可以被视为1-D或2-D结构）是ODHP活性中心，而沸石中的单位点硼是惰性的观点。相反，它报道了一种新的活性中心，具有硼硅酸盐MFI框架（BS-1）中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，仅包含孤立的硼物种。

这些在沸石框架中的孤立硼位点，特别是B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，表现出对ODHP的高活性和选择性。这些位点的空间隔离防止了BOB寡聚体的形成，并有助于催化剂的稳定性和耐水性。

理解这些孤立硼位点的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的催化剂，因为它证明了：

1. 单位点催化剂可以对ODHP具有高活性和选择性。
2. 可以通过调整硼位点的配位环境来提高催化性能。
3. 将硼位点引入沸石框架可以同时提供高活性和优异的耐久性。

这种对孤立硼位点的新认识为理性设计高效脱氢催化剂开辟了机会，可能导致商业ODHP过程中更具可扩展性的应用。

This catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, challenging the previous notion that single-site boron in zeolite is inert for the reaction. The isolated nature of these boron sites, confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques, suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a crucial role in catalyst performance.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D active sites, the emphasis on isolated boron species implies that the dimensionality of active sites may be less important than their local structure and coordination environment. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the zeolite framework appears to be key to the catalyst's performance, suggesting that understanding and optimizing such local structures could be more beneficial for designing efficient catalysts than focusing on the overall dimensionality of active sites.

The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these isolated boron sites, particularly their resistance to full hydrolysis and ability to activate both oxygen and propane, contribute significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts. This understanding could lead to the development of new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

研究聚焦于一种新型催化剂（BS-1），其在MFI沸石骨架中含有孤立的硼物种。这种催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高活性和选择性，挑战了之前认为沸石中单一位点硼对该反应惰性的观点。通过各种光谱技术证实的这些硼位点的孤立性质，表明活性位点的空间分布在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。

虽然文献没有明确讨论1-D、2-D或3-D活性位点，但对孤立硼物种的强调暗示了活性位点的维度可能不如它们的局部结构和配位环境重要。沸石骨架中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构似乎是催化剂性能的关键，这表明理解和优化这种局部结构可能比关注活性位点的整体维度更有利于设计高效催化剂。

这些孤立硼位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是它们抵抗完全水解和能够同时活化氧气和丙烷的能力，对设计更高效的催化剂贡献重大。这种理解可能导致开发出具有改进稳定性和选择性的新型催化剂，用于商业ODHP应用。

The literature provides insights into how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions:

1. Traditional understanding suggests that BOB oligomers (likely 2D or 3D structures) are the active centers for ODHP, while single-site boron in zeolites was thought to be inert.

2. However, this study introduces a new type of active center - the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst, which contains only isolated boron species. This represents a shift from 2D/3D structures to more 1D-like isolated sites.

3. The isolated nature of these boron sites in the zeolite framework was confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques, including NMR and ToF-MS.

4. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, with its specific spatial arrangement and coordination environment, showed unusual catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

Understanding these isolated, 1D-like active sites contributes to catalyst design in several ways:

1. It challenges the conventional wisdom about active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP.

2. It demonstrates that isolated boron species, when properly coordinated within a zeolite framework, can be highly active and selective for ODHP.

3. The zeolite framework provides a confined environment that may contribute to the reaction activity and selectivity.

4. The isolated nature of the boron sites in the zeolite framework appears to provide better stability and water tolerance compared to traditional boron catalysts.

This new understanding of 1D-like isolated boron sites opens up possibilities for designing more efficient and durable catalysts for ODHP, potentially leading to improved commercial applications in propene production from shale gas.
