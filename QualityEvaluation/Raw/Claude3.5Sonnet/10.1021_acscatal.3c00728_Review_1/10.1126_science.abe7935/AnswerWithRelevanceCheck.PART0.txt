          [1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature challenges conventional understanding by introducing a new type of active center - isolated boron species with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in a borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1). This differs from traditional catalysts containing BOB oligomers (likely 2D or 3D structures) as active centers.

The isolated nature of these boron sites in the zeolite framework appears crucial for their catalytic activity. This represents a shift from 2D/3D structures to more 1D-like isolated sites. The specific coordination environment of boron in the zeolite framework, particularly the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, as well as improved water tolerance and durability compared to conventional boron catalysts.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts in several ways:

1. It challenges previous assumptions about active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP.
2. It demonstrates that isolated boron species, when properly coordinated within a zeolite framework, can be highly active and selective for ODHP.
3. The zeolite framework provides a confined environment that may contribute to reaction activity and selectivity.
4. The isolated nature of the boron sites appears to provide better stability and water tolerance.

This new understanding of isolated boron sites opens up opportunities for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, potentially leading to more effective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it highlights the importance of controlling the spatial distribution and local environment of boron sites to significantly influence catalyst performance.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。文献通过引入一种新型活性中心 - 硼硅酸盐MFI骨架(BS-1)中具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼物种，挑战了传统认知。这与含有BOB寡聚体（可能是2D或3D结构）作为活性中心的传统催化剂不同。

这些硼位点在沸石骨架中的孤立性质似乎对其催化活性至关重要。这代表了从2D/3D结构向更类似1D的孤立位点的转变。硼在沸石骨架中的特定配位环境，特别是B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，表现出对ODHP的高活性和选择性，同时与传统硼催化剂相比，具有更好的耐水性和耐久性。

理解这些孤立硼位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它挑战了关于B基催化剂中ODHP活性位点的先前假设。
2. 它证明了当在沸石骨架中适当配位时，孤立的硼物种可以对ODHP具有高活性和选择性。
3. 沸石骨架提供了一个受限环境，可能有助于反应活性和选择性。
4. 硼位点的孤立性质似乎提供了更好的稳定性和耐水性。

这种对孤立硼位点的新认识为理性设计高效脱氢催化剂开辟了机会，可能导致更有效的商业ODHP应用催化剂。虽然研究没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点，但它强调了控制硼位点的空间分布和局部环境对显著影响催化剂性能的重要性。
