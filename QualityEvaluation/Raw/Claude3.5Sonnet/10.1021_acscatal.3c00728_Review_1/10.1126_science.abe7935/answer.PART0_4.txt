[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

The literature provides insights into how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions:

1. Traditional understanding suggests that BOB oligomers (likely 2D or 3D structures) are the active centers for ODHP, while single-site boron in zeolites was thought to be inert.

2. However, this study introduces a new type of active center - the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the BS-1 catalyst, which contains only isolated boron species. This represents a shift from 2D/3D structures to more 1D-like isolated sites.

3. The isolated nature of these boron sites in the zeolite framework was confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques, including NMR and ToF-MS.

4. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, with its specific spatial arrangement and coordination environment, showed unusual catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

Understanding these isolated, 1D-like active sites contributes to catalyst design in several ways:

1. It challenges the conventional wisdom about active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP.

2. It demonstrates that isolated boron species, when properly coordinated within a zeolite framework, can be highly active and selective for ODHP.

3. The zeolite framework provides a confined environment that may contribute to the reaction activity and selectivity.

4. The isolated nature of the boron sites in the zeolite framework appears to provide better stability and water tolerance compared to traditional boron catalysts.

This new understanding of 1D-like isolated boron sites opens up possibilities for designing more efficient and durable catalysts for ODHP, potentially leading to improved commercial applications in propene production from shale gas.

文献为我们提供了关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能的见解：

1. 传统观点认为BOB寡聚体（可能是2D或3D结构）是ODHP的活性中心，而沸石中的单点硼被认为是惰性的。

2. 然而，这项研究引入了一种新型的活性中心 - BS-1催化剂中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，其中只含有孤立的硼物种。这代表了从2D/3D结构向更类似1D的孤立位点的转变。

3. 通过各种光谱技术，包括核磁共振和飞行时间质谱，确认了这些硼位点在沸石骨架中的孤立性质。

4. B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，凭借其特定的空间排列和配位环境，在ODHP反应中表现出不寻常的催化性能。

理解这些孤立的、类1D的活性位点对催化剂设计的贡献包括：

1. 它挑战了关于B基催化剂中ODHP活性位点的传统观念。

2. 它证明了当在沸石骨架中适当配位时，孤立的硼物种可以对ODHP具有高活性和选择性。

3. 沸石骨架提供了一个受限环境，可能有助于反应活性和选择性。

4. 沸石骨架中硼位点的孤立性质似乎提供了比传统硼催化剂更好的稳定性和耐水性。

这种对类1D孤立硼位点的新认识为设计更高效和耐用的ODHP催化剂开辟了可能性，有潜力改进从页岩气生产丙烯的商业应用。
