[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it provides insights into the importance of isolated boron species in zeolite frameworks, particularly the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, which differs from the previously assumed BOB oligomers as active centers.

The study focuses on a new type of catalyst (BS-1) with isolated boron species in the MFI zeolite framework. This catalyst shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, challenging the previous notion that single-site boron in zeolite is inert for the reaction. The isolated nature of these boron sites, confirmed through various spectroscopic techniques, suggests that the spatial distribution of active sites plays a crucial role in catalyst performance.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D active sites, the emphasis on isolated boron species implies that the dimensionality of active sites may be less important than their local structure and coordination environment. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the zeolite framework appears to be key to the catalyst's performance, suggesting that understanding and optimizing such local structures could be more beneficial for designing efficient catalysts than focusing on the overall dimensionality of active sites.

The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these isolated boron sites, particularly their resistance to full hydrolysis and ability to activate both oxygen and propane, contribute significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts. This understanding could lead to the development of new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。然而，它提供了关于沸石骨架中孤立硼物种重要性的见解，特别是B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，这与之前假设的BOB寡聚体作为活性中心不同。

研究聚焦于一种新型催化剂（BS-1），其在MFI沸石骨架中含有孤立的硼物种。这种催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高活性和选择性，挑战了之前认为沸石中单一位点硼对该反应惰性的观点。通过各种光谱技术证实的这些硼位点的孤立性质，表明活性位点的空间分布在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。

虽然文献没有明确讨论1-D、2-D或3-D活性位点，但对孤立硼物种的强调暗示了活性位点的维度可能不如它们的局部结构和配位环境重要。沸石骨架中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构似乎是催化剂性能的关键，这表明理解和优化这种局部结构可能比关注活性位点的整体维度更有利于设计高效催化剂。

这些孤立硼位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是它们抵抗完全水解和能够同时活化氧气和丙烷的能力，对设计更高效的催化剂贡献重大。这种理解可能导致开发出具有改进稳定性和选择性的新型催化剂，用于商业ODHP应用。
