[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it provides insights into the unique properties of isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks, which can be considered as 0-D or single-site catalysts.

The study challenges the previous understanding that BOB oligomers (which could be considered as 1-D or 2-D structures) are the active centers for ODHP, while single-site boron in zeolites is inert. Instead, it reports a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1), containing only isolated boron species.

These isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework, particularly the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, exhibit high activity and selectivity for ODHP. The spatial isolation of these sites prevents the formation of BOB oligomers and contributes to the catalyst's stability and water tolerance.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by demonstrating that:

1. Single-site catalysts can be highly active and selective for ODHP.
2. The coordination environment of boron sites can be tuned to improve catalytic performance.
3. Incorporating boron sites in a zeolite framework can provide both high activity and excellent durability.

This new understanding of isolated boron sites opens up opportunities for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, potentially leading to more scalable applications in commercial ODHP processes.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响，但它提供了关于沸石框架中孤立硼位点独特性质的见解，这些可以被视为0-D或单位点催化剂。

这项研究挑战了先前认为BOB寡聚体（可以被视为1-D或2-D结构）是ODHP活性中心，而沸石中的单位点硼是惰性的观点。相反，它报道了一种新的活性中心，具有硼硅酸盐MFI框架（BS-1）中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，仅包含孤立的硼物种。

这些在沸石框架中的孤立硼位点，特别是B[OHO(H)Si]2结构，表现出对ODHP的高活性和选择性。这些位点的空间隔离防止了BOB寡聚体的形成，并有助于催化剂的稳定性和耐水性。

理解这些孤立硼位点的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的催化剂，因为它证明了：

1. 单位点催化剂可以对ODHP具有高活性和选择性。
2. 可以通过调整硼位点的配位环境来提高催化性能。
3. 将硼位点引入沸石框架可以同时提供高活性和优异的耐久性。

这种对孤立硼位点的新认识为理性设计高效脱氢催化剂开辟了机会，可能导致商业ODHP过程中更具可扩展性的应用。
