[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide insights into the nature and importance of isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks.

The study presents a new type of active center for ODHP reactions - isolated boron species with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in a borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1). This differs from conventional catalysts that contain BOB oligomers as active centers. The isolated nature of these boron sites in the zeolite framework appears to be crucial for their catalytic activity.

The research demonstrates that understanding the unique properties of these isolated boron sites contributes to designing more efficient catalysts. The B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the zeolite framework shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, as well as improved water tolerance and durability compared to conventional boron catalysts.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it highlights the importance of the specific coordination environment of boron in the zeolite framework. This suggests that controlling the spatial distribution and local environment of boron sites can significantly influence catalyst performance.

The findings open new possibilities for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts by incorporating isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks, potentially leading to more effective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP性能的影响。但是，它确实为沸石骨架中孤立硼位点的性质和重要性提供了见解。

研究提出了一种新型ODHP反应活性中心 - 硼硅酸盐MFI骨架(BS-1)中具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼物种。这与含有BOB寡聚体作为活性中心的传统催化剂不同。这些硼位点在沸石骨架中的孤立性质似乎对其催化活性至关重要。

研究表明，理解这些孤立硼位点的独特性质有助于设计更高效的催化剂。沸石骨架中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构表现出对ODHP的高活性和选择性，同时与传统硼催化剂相比，具有更好的耐水性和耐久性。

虽然研究没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点，但它强调了硼在沸石骨架中特定配位环境的重要性。这表明控制硼位点的空间分布和局部环境可以显著影响催化剂性能。

这些发现为通过在沸石骨架中引入孤立硼位点来理性设计高效脱氢催化剂开辟了新的可能性，有望导致更有效的商业ODHP应用催化剂。
