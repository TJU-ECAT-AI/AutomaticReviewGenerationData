The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature describes a novel catalyst, BS-1, with isolated boron species in a 3-D MFI zeolite framework, which differs from conventional catalysts containing BOB oligomers.

The active sites in BS-1 are uniformly distributed throughout the silica matrix, as revealed by energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental mapping. This uniform distribution likely contributes to the catalyst's high performance by maximizing the accessibility of reactants to active sites.

The unique B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure of the active sites in BS-1 plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. This structure, identified through advanced characterization techniques like NMR spectroscopy, provides isolated boron species that are more effective for ODHP compared to the BOB oligomers found in conventional catalysts.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It demonstrates the importance of site isolation in preventing overoxidation and improving selectivity.

2. It highlights the role of the zeolite framework in stabilizing active sites and preventing their deactivation through hydrolysis.

3. It shows how the specific coordination environment of boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) can be tuned to enhance catalytic performance.

4. It illustrates the potential of incorporating boron sites into structured materials like zeolites to create catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and durability.

While the literature does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, the insights gained from this 3-D zeolite-based catalyst can inform the design of catalysts with various dimensionalities. The key principles of site isolation, controlled coordination environment, and structural stability can be applied to develop catalysts with 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D architectures, each potentially offering unique advantages for specific applications in ODHP or other reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。文献描述了一种新型催化剂BS-1，它在3-D MFI沸石骨架中具有孤立的硼物种，这与含有BOB寡聚体的传统催化剂不同。

BS-1中的活性位点在二氧化硅基质中均匀分布，这一点通过能量色散光谱元素映射得到证实。这种均匀分布可能通过最大化反应物对活性位点的可及性来提高催化剂的性能。

BS-1中活性位点独特的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构在其催化活性中起着关键作用。这种结构通过核磁共振波谱等先进表征技术识别，提供了比传统催化剂中的BOB寡聚体更有效的孤立硼物种用于ODHP反应。

理解这些孤立硼位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它证明了位点隔离在防止过度氧化和提高选择性方面的重要性。

2. 它强调了沸石骨架在稳定活性位点和防止其通过水解失活方面的作用。

3. 它展示了如何调整硼的特定配位环境（B[OHO(H)Si]2）以提高催化性能。

4. 它说明了将硼位点引入沸石等结构化材料的潜力，以创造具有改进的活性、选择性和耐久性的催化剂。

虽然文献没有具体讨论1-D边缘活性位点，但从这种3-D沸石基催化剂获得的见解可以指导各种维度催化剂的设计。位点隔离、可控配位环境和结构稳定性等关键原理可应用于开发具有1-D、2-D或3-D架构的催化剂，每种架构都可能为ODHP或其他反应的特定应用提供独特优势。
