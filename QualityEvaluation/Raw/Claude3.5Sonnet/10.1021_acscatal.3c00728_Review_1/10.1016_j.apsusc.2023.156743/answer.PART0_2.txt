[1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

The given literature does not provide detailed information about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The document mentions a BN@BPO4 monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure and a pure h-BN monolithic foam with similar structure, both showing excellent performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. However, it does not discuss the specific influence of 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D active sites on catalyst performance or their unique properties and reaction mechanisms.

The text does not provide information on how understanding these sites contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. To fully answer this question, more specific research on the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions would be needed.

给定的文献没有提供关于B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度的详细信息。文档提到了具有定向碗状结构的BN@BPO4整体泡沫和具有类似结构的纯h-BN整体泡沫，两者在丙烷催化氧化脱氢生成丙烯方面都表现出优异的性能。然而，它并未讨论1-D、2-D或3-D活性位点对催化剂性能的具体影响，或它们的独特性质和反应机理。

文本没有提供关于理解这些位点如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂的信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度进行更具体的研究。
