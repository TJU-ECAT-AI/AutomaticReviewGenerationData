[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[3] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

The document does not provide specific information about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. It also does not discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites or their contribution to catalyst design for commercial applications.

However, the document does mention that bowl-like structures, including those made of boron nitride (BN), have potential in catalysis due to their large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space. The text describes a BN-based monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure that shows excellent performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This suggests that the spatial distribution and structure of the catalyst play a role in its performance, but the specific details about active sites and their dimensionality are not provided.

该文档没有提供关于B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度的具体信息。它也没有讨论一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机制，或者它们对商业应用催化剂设计的贡献。

然而，文档确实提到了碗状结构，包括由氮化硼(BN)制成的结构，由于其大的表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空心空间，在催化领域具有潜力。文本描述了一种具有定向碗状结构的BN基整体泡沫，在丙烷催化氧化脱氢生成丙烯方面表现出色。这表明催化剂的空间分布和结构对其性能起作用，但没有提供关于活性位点及其维度的具体细节。
