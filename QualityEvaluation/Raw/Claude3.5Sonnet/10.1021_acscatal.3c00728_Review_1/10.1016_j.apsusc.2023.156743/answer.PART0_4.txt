[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[3] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

The literature does not provide specific information about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. It also does not discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites or their contribution to catalyst design for commercial applications.

However, the document does mention that bowl-like structures, which are used in the creation of BN-based catalysts, have potential in catalysis due to their large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space. The text describes a BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, and a pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure that showed excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene.

These structures, with their hierarchically porous nature and oriented bowl-like arrangement, likely influence the spatial distribution of active sites, which in turn affects catalyst performance. However, the specific details of how this spatial arrangement impacts the reaction mechanisms or efficiency are not provided in the given text.

该文献没有提供有关B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度的具体信息。它也没有讨论一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，或它们对商业应用催化剂设计的贡献。

然而，文档确实提到了碗状结构在催化方面具有潜力，这是由于其较大的表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空心空间。文本描述了一种具有定向碗状结构的BN@BPO4自支撑单体泡沫，以及一种在丙烷催化氧化脱氢成丙烯方面表现出色的纯h-BN定向碗状结构单体泡沫。

这些具有多级多孔性质和定向碗状排列的结构可能会影响活性位点的空间分布，从而影响催化剂的性能。然而，给定的文本中没有提供关于这种空间排列如何影响反应机理或效率的具体细节。
