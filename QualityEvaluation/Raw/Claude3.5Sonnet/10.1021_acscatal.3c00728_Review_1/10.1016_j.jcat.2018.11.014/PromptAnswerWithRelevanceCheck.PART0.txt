[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "When silicon boride catalyst was activated in the reaction atmosphere and then cooled down to room temperature, the characteristic peaks (marked by blue asterisks) associated with B2O3 phase were observed, which implied that the origin of the unanticipated catalytic activity might be attributed to the existence of B2O3 species."

[5] "Further isotope-labeling measurements were used to investigate the reaction process. As shown in Fig. 5, when the silicon boride catalyst has been treated by D2O (labeled as SiB-D) and then pulsed into C3H8 and O2 at 535C, both HDO and D2O were formed immediately with the formation of propylene, and their amounts gradually decreased during subsequent pulses. This result suggested that the H/D atoms in the SiB-D catalyst were abstracted during the reaction process, and also implied that the BOH(D) groups of silicon boride catalyst might incorporate into the ODH reaction."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms that can be relevant to catalyst design.

The study suggests that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH groups, play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and selectivity of B-based catalysts for ODH reactions. These active sites are formed on the surface of the catalyst, with some evidence pointing to their formation at the edges of structures like h-BN.

The research indicates that the BOH groups are involved in the reaction network, possibly by promoting the adsorption of O2 and facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkanes. The formation of these active sites appears to be influenced by the reaction conditions, with the presence of steam assisting in the generation of BOH groups from BO species.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss the spatial distribution or dimensionality of active sites, it suggests that surface and edge sites are important. This implies that designing catalysts with increased exposure of these sites could potentially improve their performance.

Understanding the unique properties of these active sites, such as their ability to selectively break C-H bonds while inhibiting over-oxidation, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts. By optimizing the formation and distribution of these sites, it may be possible to enhance catalyst performance for commercial applications.

However, to fully address the question of how spatial distribution and dimensionality influence catalyst performance, further research specifically focusing on these aspects would be necessary.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响，但它确实提供了一些关于活性位点性质和反应机理的见解，这些见解与催化剂设计相关。

研究表明，硼氧物种，特别是BOH基团，在B基催化剂的催化活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。这些活性位点形成在催化剂表面，一些证据表明它们在h-BN等结构的边缘形成。

研究表明，BOH基团参与反应网络，可能通过促进O2的吸附和促进烷烃中氢原子的抽取。这些活性位点的形成似乎受反应条件的影响，蒸汽的存在有助于从BO物种生成BOH基团。

虽然研究没有明确讨论活性位点的空间分布或维度，但它表明表面和边缘位点很重要。这意味着设计具有增加这些位点暴露的催化剂可能会提高其性能。

了解这些活性位点的独特性质，如它们选择性地断裂C-H键同时抑制过度氧化的能力，可以有助于设计更高效的催化剂。通过优化这些位点的形成和分布，可能可以提高催化剂在商业应用中的性能。

然而，要充分解答空间分布和维度如何影响催化剂性能的问题，还需要进行专门针对这些方面的进一步研究。

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The document mentions that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are considered to be the active sites responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing structures, such as h-BN, suggesting a potential 1-D or edge-localized nature of the active sites.

The literature also indicates that the selectivity differences between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts may be due to differences in subsurface structure. This suggests that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could indeed play a role in catalyst performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these edge-localized active sites could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts by:

1. Optimizing the exposure of edge sites to increase the number of active sites.
2. Tailoring the electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures to enhance activity and selectivity.
3. Developing strategies to prevent overoxidation of desired products by controlling the spatial distribution of active sites.
4. Exploring new boron-based materials with optimized spatial distributions of active sites for improved catalytic performance.

However, the document does not provide specific information on how to design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications based on this understanding. Further research would be needed to fully address the question and develop practical applications.

文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响。但是，它提供了一些相关的见解：

文献提到，硼氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，被认为是负责ODH反应高活性和选择性的活性位点。这些活性位点通常位于含硼结构（如h-BN）的边缘，暗示了活性位点可能具有一维或边缘局域化的特性。

文献还指出，硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间的选择性差异可能是由于亚表面结构的不同造成的。这表明活性位点的空间分布和维度确实可能对催化剂性能起作用。

理解这些边缘局域化活性位点的独特性质和反应机理可以通过以下方式有助于设计更高效的催化剂：

1. 优化边缘位点的暴露，以增加活性位点的数量。
2. 调整活性位点与相邻结构之间的电子相互作用，以提高活性和选择性。
3. 通过控制活性位点的空间分布，开发防止目标产物过度氧化的策略。
4. 探索具有优化活性位点空间分布的新型含硼材料，以改善催化性能。

然而，该文献并未提供基于这种理解如何设计更高效的商业应用催化剂的具体信息。需要进行进一步的研究才能全面回答这个问题并开发实际应用。

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were active for ODH of ethane, suggesting the importance of 1-D edge active sites. The formation of BOx active sites on surfaces of h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts was related to high propylene selectivity, implying that understanding these unique sites contributes to catalyst design. The reaction mechanism involving BOH sites reacting with oxygen and abstracting hydrogen from propane provides insight into how these sites function, which could inform the development of more efficient catalysts. However, the document does not explicitly discuss how this understanding translates to commercial applications or compare the performance of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D active sites.

文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。然而,它提到了形成在六方氮化硼(h-BN)边缘的BO位点对乙烷氧化脱氢反应是活性的,这表明了一维边缘活性位点的重要性。在h-BN和其他含硼催化剂表面形成的BOx活性位点与高丙烯选择性有关,这意味着理解这些独特位点有助于催化剂设计。涉及BOH位点与氧气反应并从丙烷中提取氢的反应机理为这些位点的功能提供了洞察,这可能会为开发更高效的催化剂提供信息。然而,该文档并未明确讨论这种理解如何转化为商业应用,也没有比较一维、二维和三维活性位点的性能。

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature and importance of boron-based active sites.

The literature mentions that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are thought to form at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN. This suggests that 1-D edge sites play a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures are noted to influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity. This implies that the spatial arrangement of active sites relative to the overall catalyst structure is important for performance.

The literature also mentions that different boron-containing catalysts may have varying selectivities due to differences in their subsurface structure. This suggests that the 3-D arrangement of boron species within the catalyst bulk, not just at the surface, can impact catalytic performance.

While the document does not explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, it does emphasize that boron species are indispensable for high ODH activity. This understanding could guide future catalyst design by focusing on optimizing the distribution and nature of boron-based active sites, particularly at edges and surfaces, to enhance performance in commercial ODHP applications.

文献提到，硼氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，是ODH反应高活性和选择性的原因。这些活性位点被认为形成在含硼材料(如h-BN)的边缘。这表明一维边缘位点在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用。

文献指出，活性位点与相邻结构之间的电子相互作用会影响催化剂的活性和选择性。这意味着活性位点相对于整体催化剂结构的空间排列对性能很重要。

文献还提到，不同的含硼催化剂可能由于亚表面结构的差异而具有不同的选择性。这表明催化剂体相内部的硼物种的三维排列，而不仅仅是表面的排列，可以影响催化性能。

虽然文档没有明确讨论理解这些特性如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，但确实强调硼物种对于高ODH活性是不可或缺的。这种理解可以通过优化硼基活性位点的分布和性质，特别是在边缘和表面，来指导未来的催化剂设计，从而提高商业ODHP应用的性能。

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature and location of active sites, which can be related to their spatial distribution and dimensionality.

The quotes suggest that boron-oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are responsible for the high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN, indicating a preference for 1-D edge sites.

The formation of these edge sites likely contributes to the efficiency of the catalysts by providing accessible active centers for reactants. The electronic interactions between these sites and adjacent structures influence their performance, suggesting that the local environment of the active sites plays a crucial role.

Understanding the importance of edge sites and their unique properties can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on maximizing the number of accessible edge sites and optimizing their local environment, researchers may be able to develop catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how 2-D or 3-D distributions of active sites might affect catalyst performance, nor does it directly compare the efficiency of different spatial distributions. Further research would be needed to fully understand the impact of active site dimensionality on ODHP reactions and to leverage this knowledge for catalyst design.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响，但它确实提供了一些关于活性位点性质和位置的见解，这些可以与它们的空间分布和维度相关联。

引文表明，硼-氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，是ODH反应中高活性和选择性的原因。这些活性位点通常存在于含硼材料（如h-BN）的边缘，表明它们倾向于形成一维边缘位点。

这些边缘位点的形成可能通过为反应物提供可接近的活性中心，从而提高催化剂的效率。这些位点与邻近结构之间的电子相互作用影响其性能，表明活性位点的局部环境起着关键作用。

理解边缘位点的重要性及其独特性质可以指导更高效催化剂的设计。通过专注于最大化可接近的边缘位点数量并优化其局部环境，研究人员可能能够开发出具有改进的活性和选择性的商业ODHP应用催化剂。

然而，文献并未提供关于活性位点的二维或三维分布如何影响催化剂性能的具体信息，也没有直接比较不同空间分布的效率。需要进一步研究以全面了解活性位点维度对ODHP反应的影响，并利用这些知识进行催化剂设计。
