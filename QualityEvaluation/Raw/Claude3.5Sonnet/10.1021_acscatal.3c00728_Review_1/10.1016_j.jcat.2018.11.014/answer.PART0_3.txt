[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature and importance of boron-based active sites.

The literature mentions that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are thought to form at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN. This suggests that 1-D edge sites play a crucial role in the catalytic performance.

The electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures are noted to influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity. This implies that the spatial arrangement of active sites relative to the overall catalyst structure is important for performance.

The literature also mentions that different boron-containing catalysts may have varying selectivities due to differences in their subsurface structure. This suggests that the 3-D arrangement of boron species within the catalyst bulk, not just at the surface, can impact catalytic performance.

While the document does not explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, it does emphasize that boron species are indispensable for high ODH activity. This understanding could guide future catalyst design by focusing on optimizing the distribution and nature of boron-based active sites, particularly at edges and surfaces, to enhance performance in commercial ODHP applications.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于硼基活性位点的性质和重要性的见解。

文献提到，硼氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，是ODH反应高活性和选择性的原因。这些活性位点被认为形成在含硼材料(如h-BN)的边缘。这表明一维边缘位点在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用。

文献指出，活性位点与相邻结构之间的电子相互作用会影响催化剂的活性和选择性。这意味着活性位点相对于整体催化剂结构的空间排列对性能很重要。

文献还提到，不同的含硼催化剂可能由于亚表面结构的差异而具有不同的选择性。这表明催化剂体相内部的硼物种的三维排列，而不仅仅是表面的排列，可以影响催化性能。

虽然文档没有明确讨论理解这些特性如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，但确实强调硼物种对于高ODH活性是不可或缺的。这种理解可以通过优化硼基活性位点的分布和性质，特别是在边缘和表面，来指导未来的催化剂设计，从而提高商业ODHP应用的性能。
