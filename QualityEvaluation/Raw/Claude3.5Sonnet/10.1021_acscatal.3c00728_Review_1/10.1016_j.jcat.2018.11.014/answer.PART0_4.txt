[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "Huang et al. reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "Grant et al. found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature and location of active sites, which can be related to their spatial distribution and dimensionality.

The quotes suggest that boron-oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are responsible for the high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN, indicating a preference for 1-D edge sites.

The formation of these edge sites likely contributes to the efficiency of the catalysts by providing accessible active centers for reactants. The electronic interactions between these sites and adjacent structures influence their performance, suggesting that the local environment of the active sites plays a crucial role.

Understanding the importance of edge sites and their unique properties can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on maximizing the number of accessible edge sites and optimizing their local environment, researchers may be able to develop catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how 2-D or 3-D distributions of active sites might affect catalyst performance, nor does it directly compare the efficiency of different spatial distributions. Further research would be needed to fully understand the impact of active site dimensionality on ODHP reactions and to leverage this knowledge for catalyst design.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响，但它确实提供了一些关于活性位点性质和位置的见解，这些可以与它们的空间分布和维度相关联。

引文表明，硼-氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，是ODH反应中高活性和选择性的原因。这些活性位点通常存在于含硼材料（如h-BN）的边缘，表明它们倾向于形成一维边缘位点。

这些边缘位点的形成可能通过为反应物提供可接近的活性中心，从而提高催化剂的效率。这些位点与邻近结构之间的电子相互作用影响其性能，表明活性位点的局部环境起着关键作用。

理解边缘位点的重要性及其独特性质可以指导更高效催化剂的设计。通过专注于最大化可接近的边缘位点数量并优化其局部环境，研究人员可能能够开发出具有改进的活性和选择性的商业ODHP应用催化剂。

然而，文献并未提供关于活性位点的二维或三维分布如何影响催化剂性能的具体信息，也没有直接比较不同空间分布的效率。需要进一步研究以全面了解活性位点维度对ODHP反应的影响，并利用这些知识进行催化剂设计。
