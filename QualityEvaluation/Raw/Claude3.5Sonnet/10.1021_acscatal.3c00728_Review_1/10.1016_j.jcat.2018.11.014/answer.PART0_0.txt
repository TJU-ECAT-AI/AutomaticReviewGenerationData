[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "When silicon boride catalyst was activated in the reaction atmosphere and then cooled down to room temperature, the characteristic peaks (marked by blue asterisks) associated with B2O3 phase were observed, which implied that the origin of the unanticipated catalytic activity might be attributed to the existence of B2O3 species."

[5] "Further isotope-labeling measurements were used to investigate the reaction process. As shown in Fig. 5, when the silicon boride catalyst has been treated by D2O (labeled as SiB-D) and then pulsed into C3H8 and O2 at 535C, both HDO and D2O were formed immediately with the formation of propylene, and their amounts gradually decreased during subsequent pulses. This result suggested that the H/D atoms in the SiB-D catalyst were abstracted during the reaction process, and also implied that the BOH(D) groups of silicon boride catalyst might incorporate into the ODH reaction."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms that can be relevant to catalyst design.

The study suggests that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH groups, play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and selectivity of B-based catalysts for ODH reactions. These active sites are formed on the surface of the catalyst, with some evidence pointing to their formation at the edges of structures like h-BN.

The research indicates that the BOH groups are involved in the reaction network, possibly by promoting the adsorption of O2 and facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from alkanes. The formation of these active sites appears to be influenced by the reaction conditions, with the presence of steam assisting in the generation of BOH groups from BO species.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss the spatial distribution or dimensionality of active sites, it suggests that surface and edge sites are important. This implies that designing catalysts with increased exposure of these sites could potentially improve their performance.

Understanding the unique properties of these active sites, such as their ability to selectively break C-H bonds while inhibiting over-oxidation, could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts. By optimizing the formation and distribution of these sites, it may be possible to enhance catalyst performance for commercial applications.

However, to fully address the question of how spatial distribution and dimensionality influence catalyst performance, further research specifically focusing on these aspects would be necessary.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响，但它确实提供了一些关于活性位点性质和反应机理的见解，这些见解与催化剂设计相关。

研究表明，硼氧物种，特别是BOH基团，在B基催化剂的催化活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。这些活性位点形成在催化剂表面，一些证据表明它们在h-BN等结构的边缘形成。

研究表明，BOH基团参与反应网络，可能通过促进O2的吸附和促进烷烃中氢原子的抽取。这些活性位点的形成似乎受反应条件的影响，蒸汽的存在有助于从BO物种生成BOH基团。

虽然研究没有明确讨论活性位点的空间分布或维度，但它表明表面和边缘位点很重要。这意味着设计具有增加这些位点暴露的催化剂可能会提高其性能。

了解这些活性位点的独特性质，如它们选择性地断裂C-H键同时抑制过度氧化的能力，可以有助于设计更高效的催化剂。通过优化这些位点的形成和分布，可能可以提高催化剂在商业应用中的性能。

然而，要充分解答空间分布和维度如何影响催化剂性能的问题，还需要进行专门针对这些方面的进一步研究。
