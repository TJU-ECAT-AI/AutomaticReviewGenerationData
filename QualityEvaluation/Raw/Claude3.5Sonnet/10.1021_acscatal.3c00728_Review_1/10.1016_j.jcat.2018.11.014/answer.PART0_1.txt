[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "Anyhow, people in different groups identified with the idea that the boron species could be truly indispensable element for high ODH activity."

[5] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The document mentions that boron oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are considered to be the active sites responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing structures, such as h-BN, suggesting a potential 1-D or edge-localized nature of the active sites.

The literature also indicates that the selectivity differences between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts may be due to differences in subsurface structure. This suggests that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites could indeed play a role in catalyst performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these edge-localized active sites could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts by:

1. Optimizing the exposure of edge sites to increase the number of active sites.
2. Tailoring the electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures to enhance activity and selectivity.
3. Developing strategies to prevent overoxidation of desired products by controlling the spatial distribution of active sites.
4. Exploring new boron-based materials with optimized spatial distributions of active sites for improved catalytic performance.

However, the document does not provide specific information on how to design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications based on this understanding. Further research would be needed to fully address the question and develop practical applications.

文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响。但是，它提供了一些相关的见解：

文献提到，硼氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，被认为是负责ODH反应高活性和选择性的活性位点。这些活性位点通常位于含硼结构（如h-BN）的边缘，暗示了活性位点可能具有一维或边缘局域化的特性。

文献还指出，硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间的选择性差异可能是由于亚表面结构的不同造成的。这表明活性位点的空间分布和维度确实可能对催化剂性能起作用。

理解这些边缘局域化活性位点的独特性质和反应机理可以通过以下方式有助于设计更高效的催化剂：

1. 优化边缘位点的暴露，以增加活性位点的数量。
2. 调整活性位点与相邻结构之间的电子相互作用，以提高活性和选择性。
3. 通过控制活性位点的空间分布，开发防止目标产物过度氧化的策略。
4. 探索具有优化活性位点空间分布的新型含硼材料，以改善催化性能。

然而，该文献并未提供基于这种理解如何设计更高效的商业应用催化剂的具体信息。需要进行进一步的研究才能全面回答这个问题并开发实际应用。
