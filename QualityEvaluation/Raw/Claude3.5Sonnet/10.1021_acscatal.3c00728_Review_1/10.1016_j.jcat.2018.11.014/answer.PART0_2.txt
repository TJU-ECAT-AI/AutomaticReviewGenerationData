[1] "Grant et al. found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts."

[2] "Huang et al. reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane."

[3] "Our previous work demonstrated that the BOH sites initially reacted with molecular oxygen leading to the production of BOOB intermediates and further abstracted the hydrogen atoms from propane, forming C3H6 and H2O in the ODH of propane."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were active for ODH of ethane, suggesting the importance of 1-D edge active sites. The formation of BOx active sites on surfaces of h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts was related to high propylene selectivity, implying that understanding these unique sites contributes to catalyst design. The reaction mechanism involving BOH sites reacting with oxygen and abstracting hydrogen from propane provides insight into how these sites function, which could inform the development of more efficient catalysts. However, the document does not explicitly discuss how this understanding translates to commercial applications or compare the performance of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D active sites.

文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。然而,它提到了形成在六方氮化硼(h-BN)边缘的BO位点对乙烷氧化脱氢反应是活性的,这表明了一维边缘活性位点的重要性。在h-BN和其他含硼催化剂表面形成的BOx活性位点与高丙烯选择性有关,这意味着理解这些独特位点有助于催化剂设计。涉及BOH位点与氧气反应并从丙烷中提取氢的反应机理为这些位点的功能提供了洞察,这可能会为开发更高效的催化剂提供信息。然而,该文档并未明确讨论这种理解如何转化为商业应用,也没有比较一维、二维和三维活性位点的性能。
