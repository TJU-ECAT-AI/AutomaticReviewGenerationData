          [1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "Huang et al. reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "Grant et al. found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts."

[6] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

          The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into the nature and location of active sites that can be related to their spatial distribution and dimensionality.

Boron-oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are identified as responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN, indicating a preference for 1-D edge sites. The formation of BOx active sites on surfaces of h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts is related to high propylene selectivity.

The electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures influence catalyst performance, suggesting that the local environment of the active sites plays a crucial role. The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts may result from differences in subsurface structure, implying that the 3-D arrangement of boron species within the catalyst bulk can impact catalytic performance.

Understanding the importance of edge sites and their unique properties can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on maximizing the number of accessible edge sites and optimizing their local environment, researchers may be able to develop catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how 2-D or 3-D distributions of active sites might affect catalyst performance, nor does it directly compare the efficiency of different spatial distributions. Further research would be needed to fully understand the impact of active site dimensionality on ODHP reactions and to leverage this knowledge for catalyst design and commercial applications.

          虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响，但它提供了关于活性位点性质和位置的见解，这些可以与它们的空间分布和维度相关联。

硼-氧物种，特别是BOH和BO(H)基团，被确定为ODH反应中高活性和选择性的原因。这些活性位点通常存在于含硼材料（如h-BN）的边缘，表明它们倾向于形成一维边缘位点。在h-BN和其他含硼催化剂表面形成的BOx活性位点与高丙烯选择性有关。

活性位点与邻近结构之间的电子相互作用影响催化剂性能，表明活性位点的局部环境起着关键作用。硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间的选择性差异可能是由于亚表面结构的不同造成的，这意味着催化剂体相内部的硼物种的三维排列可以影响催化性能。

理解边缘位点的重要性及其独特性质可以指导更高效催化剂的设计。通过专注于最大化可接近的边缘位点数量并优化其局部环境，研究人员可能能够开发出具有改进的活性和选择性的商业ODHP应用催化剂。

然而，文献并未提供关于活性位点的二维或三维分布如何影响催化剂性能的具体信息，也没有直接比较不同空间分布的效率。需要进一步研究以全面了解活性位点维度对ODHP反应的影响，并利用这些知识进行催化剂设计和商业应用。
