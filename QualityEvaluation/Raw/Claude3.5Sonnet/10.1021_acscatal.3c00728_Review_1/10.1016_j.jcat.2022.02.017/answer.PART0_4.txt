[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces, particularly defect sites and aggregated species, are more active for ODHP compared to isolated, fully incorporated boron units. 

Homogeneous distribution of boron in zeolites is beneficial, but the micro-environment of boron species is crucial. Aggregated boron species show higher efficiency in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species. Additionally, boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions, with boron sites having more OH groups being more reactive.

While the literature does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, it emphasizes the importance of defect sites and surface-accessible boron species. Understanding these properties contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the need for creating accessible, partially coordinated boron sites with appropriate OH groups, rather than fully incorporated framework boron.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, focus should be placed on:
1. Maximizing defect boron sites and aggregated species
2. Ensuring homogeneous distribution while maintaining accessibility
3. Incorporating boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species
4. Optimizing OH group content on boron sites

These insights can guide the development of catalysts with improved performance in ODHP reactions at lower temperatures, potentially enhancing their commercial viability.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，表面上的含氧硼位点，特别是缺陷位点和聚集物种，比完全掺入的孤立硼单元对ODHP更活跃。

硼在沸石中的均匀分布是有利的，但硼物种的微环境至关重要。与孤立物种相比，聚集的硼物种在丙烷的C-H键活化方面表现出更高的效率。此外，硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种负责低温ODHP反应，具有更多OH基团的硼位点更容易被二氧脱氢。

虽然文献没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点，但它强调了缺陷位点和表面可接触硼物种的重要性。理解这些特性有助于催化剂设计，强调需要创建可接触的、部分配位的硼位点和适当的OH基团，而不是完全掺入框架的硼。

为了设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，应该关注：
1. 最大化缺陷硼位点和聚集物种
2. 确保均匀分布的同时保持可接触性
3. 纳入硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种
4. 优化硼位点上的OH基团含量

这些见解可以指导开发在较低温度下ODHP反应性能更好的催化剂，可能提高其商业可行性。
