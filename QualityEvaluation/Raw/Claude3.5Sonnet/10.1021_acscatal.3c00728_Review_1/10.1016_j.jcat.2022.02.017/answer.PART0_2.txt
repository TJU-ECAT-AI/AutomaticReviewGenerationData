[1] "The oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of the h-BN and other bulky and supported boron-containing catalysts are the origin for catalyzing ODH reactions"

[2] "Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties"

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "The isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane"

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP performance. However, it does provide some insights into the importance of the distribution and environment of boron species in catalysts.

The document emphasizes that the micro-environment of boron species is crucial for catalytic properties in ODHP reactions. It highlights that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces are the origin of catalytic activity. The distribution of boron in borosilicate zeolites is noted to be homogeneous, which contributes to their promising performance as ODHP catalysts.

The literature distinguishes between different types of boron sites and their effectiveness in ODHP reactions. Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are reported to be inactive. In contrast, defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are described as essential for catalyzing ODHP reactions, with aggregated species being more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane.

The document also mentions that isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability, with hydrogen bonding between BOH and adjacent SiOH facilitating the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites or their unique properties and reaction mechanisms, it does suggest that understanding the specific arrangements and interactions of boron species within catalyst structures is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对ODHP性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于催化剂中硼物种分布和环境重要性的见解。

文档强调硼物种的微观环境对ODHP反应的催化性能至关重要。它强调表面上的含氧硼位点是催化活性的来源。硼硅沸石中硼的分布被注意到是均匀的，这有助于它们作为ODHP催化剂的良好性能。

文献区分了不同类型的硼位点及其在ODHP反应中的有效性。完全incorporated进沸石骨架的孤立B(OSi)3单元据报道是无活性的。相比之下，缺陷硼位点和聚集硼物种被描述为催化ODHP反应的关键，其中聚集物种在丙烷的C-H键活化方面更有效。

文档还提到，硼硅MFI型沸石中的孤立硼（B[OHO(H)Si]2）显示出优异的耐久性，BOH与相邻SiOH之间的氢键促进了氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

虽然文献并未明确讨论1-D边缘活性位点或其独特的性质和反应机理，但它确实表明，了解催化剂结构中硼物种的具体排列和相互作用对于设计更高效的ODHP反应催化剂至关重要。
