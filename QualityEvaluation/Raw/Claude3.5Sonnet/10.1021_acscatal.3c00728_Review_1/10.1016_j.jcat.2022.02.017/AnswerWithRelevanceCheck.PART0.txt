          [1] "The oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of the h-BN and other bulky and supported boron-containing catalysts are the origin for catalyzing ODH reactions"

[2] "Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties"

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen"

[6] "The isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane"

          While the literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, it provides valuable insights into how different types of boron sites influence catalytic performance:

1. Surface distribution: Oxygenated boron sites on surfaces of various boron-containing catalysts are crucial for ODH reactions.

2. Homogeneous distribution: In borosilicate zeolites, a homogeneous distribution of boron proves promising for ODHP reactions.

3. Micro-environment: The micro-environment of boron species is the key factor affecting catalytic properties.

4. Isolated vs. defect sites: Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP, while defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing the reaction.

5. Aggregated species: Aggregated boron species are more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species.

6. Specific active structures: Boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions.

7. OH groups: Boron sites with more OH groups are more easily dehydrogenated by oxygen.

8. Hydrogen bonding: In some cases, like isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite, hydrogen bonding between BOH and adjacent SiOH facilitates synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

These findings suggest that the spatial arrangement, connectivity, and local environment of boron sites significantly impact catalyst performance. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it implies that more accessible and defective boron sites, which could potentially include edge sites, are generally more active for ODHP.

Understanding these structure-activity relationships can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by focusing on:

1. Maximizing defect boron sites and aggregated species
2. Ensuring homogeneous distribution while maintaining accessibility
3. Incorporating specific active structures like boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species
4. Optimizing OH group content on boron sites
5. Utilizing hydrogen bonding to enhance synergistic conversions

These insights can lead to the development of catalysts with improved performance in ODHP reactions at lower temperatures, potentially enhancing their commercial viability.

          虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对ODHP反应性能的影响，但它提供了有关不同类型硼位点如何影响催化性能的宝贵见解：

1. 表面分布：各种含硼催化剂表面的含氧硼位点对ODH反应至关重要。

2. 均匀分布：在硼硅沸石中，硼的均匀分布对ODHP反应表现出良好前景。

3. 微环境：硼物种的微环境是影响催化性能的关键因素。

4. 孤立位点vs缺陷位点：完全掺入沸石骨架的孤立B(OSi)3单元对ODHP无活性，而缺陷硼位点对催化反应至关重要。

5. 聚集物种：与孤立物种相比，聚集的硼物种在丙烷的C-H键活化方面更有效。

6. 特定活性结构：硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种负责低温ODHP反应。

7. OH基团：具有更多OH基团的硼位点更容易被氧气脱氢。

8. 氢键：在某些情况下，如硼硅MFI型沸石中的孤立硼（B[OHO(H)Si]2），BOH与相邻SiOH之间的氢键促进了氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

这些发现表明，硼位点的空间排列、连接性和局部环境显著影响催化剂性能。虽然文献没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点，但它暗示更易接近和有缺陷的硼位点（可能包括边缘位点）通常对ODHP更活跃。

理解这些结构-活性关系可以指导更高效催化剂的设计，以应用于商业用途，重点关注：

1. 最大化缺陷硼位点和聚集物种
2. 确保均匀分布的同时保持可接触性
3. 纳入特定活性结构，如硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种
4. 优化硼位点上的OH基团含量
5. 利用氢键增强协同转化

这些见解可以引导开发在较低温度下ODHP反应性能更好的催化剂，可能提高其商业可行性。
