The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the influence of different boron species on catalyst performance.

The document indicates that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces are key for catalyzing ODH reactions. In borosilicate zeolites, the micro-environment of boron species is crucial for catalytic properties. Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive, while defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing ODHP. Aggregated boron species are more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species.

The paper also mentions that boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions, with boron sites having more OH groups being easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen.

While the document doesn't specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites or their unique properties and reaction mechanisms, it suggests that understanding the nature and distribution of boron species is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The findings imply that creating catalysts with more defect boron sites, aggregated boron species, and boron sites with multiple OH groups could potentially improve ODHP performance.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些关于不同硼物种对催化剂性能影响的见解。

文献指出，表面上的含氧硼位点是催化ODH反应的关键。在硼硅沸石中，硼物种的微环境对催化性能至关重要。完全掺入沸石骨架的孤立B(OSi)3单元是无活性的，而缺陷硼位点对催化ODHP反应至关重要。相比于孤立的硼物种，聚集的硼物种在丙烷的C-H键活化方面更有效。

文章还提到，硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种负责低温ODHP反应，具有更多OH基团的硼位点更容易被双氧脱氢。

虽然文献没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点或其独特性质和反应机理，但它表明理解硼物种的性质和分布对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。这些发现暗示，创造具有更多缺陷硼位点、聚集硼物种和多OH基团硼位点的催化剂可能会提高ODHP性能。

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "The isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces are crucial for catalyzing ODH reactions. Isolated boron units fully incorporated into zeolite frameworks are found to be inactive, while defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are essential for catalyzing ODHP and more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane.

The unique properties of these sites, particularly those with hydrogen bonding capabilities, contribute to improved catalyst performance. For instance, isolated boron sites with hydrogen bonds to adjacent silanols show superior durability and facilitate synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

Understanding these reaction mechanisms and the importance of site distribution can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on creating catalysts with a higher proportion of defect boron sites, aggregated boron species, and optimized hydrogen bonding, researchers can potentially develop more active and selective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not explicitly discuss the influence of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D distributions of active sites or specifically mention 1-D edge active sites. More research would be needed to fully understand the impact of these spatial arrangements on catalyst performance in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，表面上的含氧硼位点对催化ODH反应至关重要。完全嵌入沸石骨架的孤立硼单元被发现是无活性的，而缺陷硼位点和聚集硼物种对催化ODHP反应至关重要，并且在丙烷的C-H键活化方面更有效。

这些位点的独特性质，特别是具有氢键能力的位点，有助于提高催化剂性能。例如，与相邻硅醇形成氢键的孤立硼位点表现出优异的耐久性，并促进氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

理解这些反应机制和位点分布的重要性可以指导更高效催化剂的设计。通过专注于创建具有更高比例缺陷硼位点、聚集硼物种和优化氢键的催化剂，研究人员可能开发出更活跃、更选择性的商业ODHP应用催化剂。

然而，文献并未明确讨论1-D、2-D和3-D活性位点分布的影响，也没有特别提到1-D边缘活性位点。需要进行更多研究以充分理解这些空间排列对ODHP反应中催化剂性能的影响。

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into how different types of boron sites influence catalytic performance:

1. Surface oxygenated boron sites on various boron-containing catalysts are crucial for ODH reactions.

2. In borosilicate zeolites, the micro-environment of boron species is the key factor affecting catalytic properties.

3. Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP.

4. Defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are more effective in catalyzing ODHP and activating C-H bonds in propane.

5. Boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions, with boron sites having more OH groups being more easily dehydrogenated by oxygen.

These findings suggest that the spatial arrangement and connectivity of boron sites significantly impact catalyst performance. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it implies that more accessible and defective boron sites, which could potentially include edge sites, are generally more active for ODHP. Understanding these structure-activity relationships can guide the design of more efficient catalysts by focusing on creating catalysts with a higher proportion of these active boron species.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces, particularly defect sites and aggregated species, are more active for ODHP compared to isolated, fully incorporated boron units. 

Homogeneous distribution of boron in zeolites is beneficial, but the micro-environment of boron species is crucial. Aggregated boron species show higher efficiency in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species. Additionally, boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions, with boron sites having more OH groups being more reactive.

While the literature does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, it emphasizes the importance of defect sites and surface-accessible boron species. Understanding these properties contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the need for creating accessible, partially coordinated boron sites with appropriate OH groups, rather than fully incorporated framework boron.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, focus should be placed on:
1. Maximizing defect boron sites and aggregated species
2. Ensuring homogeneous distribution while maintaining accessibility
3. Incorporating boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species
4. Optimizing OH group content on boron sites

These insights can guide the development of catalysts with improved performance in ODHP reactions at lower temperatures, potentially enhancing their commercial viability.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，表面上的含氧硼位点，特别是缺陷位点和聚集物种，比完全掺入的孤立硼单元对ODHP更活跃。

硼在沸石中的均匀分布是有利的，但硼物种的微环境至关重要。与孤立物种相比，聚集的硼物种在丙烷的C-H键活化方面表现出更高的效率。此外，硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种负责低温ODHP反应，具有更多OH基团的硼位点更容易被二氧脱氢。

虽然文献没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点，但它强调了缺陷位点和表面可接触硼物种的重要性。理解这些特性有助于催化剂设计，强调需要创建可接触的、部分配位的硼位点和适当的OH基团，而不是完全掺入框架的硼。

为了设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，应该关注：
1. 最大化缺陷硼位点和聚集物种
2. 确保均匀分布的同时保持可接触性
3. 纳入硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种
4. 优化硼位点上的OH基团含量

这些见解可以指导开发在较低温度下ODHP反应性能更好的催化剂，可能提高其商业可行性。
