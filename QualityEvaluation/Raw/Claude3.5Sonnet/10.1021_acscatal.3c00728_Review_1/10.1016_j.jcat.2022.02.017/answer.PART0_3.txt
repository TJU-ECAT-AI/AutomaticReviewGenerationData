[1] "The oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of the h-BN and other bulky and supported boron-containing catalysts are the origin for catalyzing ODH reactions"

[2] "Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties"

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen"

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into how different types of boron sites influence catalytic performance:

1. Surface oxygenated boron sites on various boron-containing catalysts are crucial for ODH reactions.

2. In borosilicate zeolites, the micro-environment of boron species is the key factor affecting catalytic properties.

3. Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP.

4. Defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are more effective in catalyzing ODHP and activating C-H bonds in propane.

5. Boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions, with boron sites having more OH groups being more easily dehydrogenated by oxygen.

These findings suggest that the spatial arrangement and connectivity of boron sites significantly impact catalyst performance. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it implies that more accessible and defective boron sites, which could potentially include edge sites, are generally more active for ODHP. Understanding these structure-activity relationships can guide the design of more efficient catalysts by focusing on creating catalysts with a higher proportion of these active boron species.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D），但它确实提供了不同类型硼位点如何影响催化性能的见解：

1. 各种含硼催化剂表面的含氧硼位点对ODH反应至关重要。

2. 在硼硅分子筛中，硼物种的微环境是影响催化性能的关键因素。

3. 完全并入分子筛骨架的孤立B(OSi)3单元对ODHP反应不活跃。

4. 缺陷硼位点和聚集的硼物种在催化ODHP和活化丙烷的C-H键方面更有效。

5. 硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种负责低温ODHP反应，具有更多OH基的硼位点更容易被氧气脱氢。

这些发现表明，硼位点的空间排列和连接性显著影响催化剂性能。虽然文献没有明确讨论1-D边缘活性位点，但它暗示更易接近和有缺陷的硼位点（可能包括边缘位点）通常对ODHP更活跃。理解这些结构-活性关系可以指导更高效催化剂的设计，重点是创造具有更高比例这些活性硼物种的催化剂。
