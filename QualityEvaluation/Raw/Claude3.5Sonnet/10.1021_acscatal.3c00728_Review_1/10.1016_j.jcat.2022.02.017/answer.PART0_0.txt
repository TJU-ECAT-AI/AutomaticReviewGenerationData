The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the influence of different boron species on catalyst performance.

The document indicates that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces are key for catalyzing ODH reactions. In borosilicate zeolites, the micro-environment of boron species is crucial for catalytic properties. Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive, while defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing ODHP. Aggregated boron species are more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species.

The paper also mentions that boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions, with boron sites having more OH groups being easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen.

While the document doesn't specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites or their unique properties and reaction mechanisms, it suggests that understanding the nature and distribution of boron species is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The findings imply that creating catalysts with more defect boron sites, aggregated boron species, and boron sites with multiple OH groups could potentially improve ODHP performance.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些关于不同硼物种对催化剂性能影响的见解。

文献指出，表面上的含氧硼位点是催化ODH反应的关键。在硼硅沸石中，硼物种的微环境对催化性能至关重要。完全掺入沸石骨架的孤立B(OSi)3单元是无活性的，而缺陷硼位点对催化ODHP反应至关重要。相比于孤立的硼物种，聚集的硼物种在丙烷的C-H键活化方面更有效。

文章还提到，硼氧环和三配位平面BO3/2物种负责低温ODHP反应，具有更多OH基团的硼位点更容易被双氧脱氢。

虽然文献没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点或其独特性质和反应机理，但它表明理解硼物种的性质和分布对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。这些发现暗示，创造具有更多缺陷硼位点、聚集硼物种和多OH基团硼位点的催化剂可能会提高ODHP性能。
