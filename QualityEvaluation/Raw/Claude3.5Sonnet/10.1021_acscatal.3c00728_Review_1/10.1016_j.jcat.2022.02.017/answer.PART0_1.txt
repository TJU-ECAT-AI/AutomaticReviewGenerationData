[1] "Boron-containing materials generally showed immense potential in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane owing to their superior catalytic activity and high selectivity to olefin, particularly by avoiding the deep oxidation reaction of olefin"

[2] "The oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of the h-BN and other bulky and supported boron-containing catalysts are the origin for catalyzing ODH reactions"

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "The isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that oxygenated boron sites on surfaces are crucial for catalyzing ODH reactions. Isolated boron units fully incorporated into zeolite frameworks are found to be inactive, while defect boron sites and aggregated boron species are essential for catalyzing ODHP and more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane.

The unique properties of these sites, particularly those with hydrogen bonding capabilities, contribute to improved catalyst performance. For instance, isolated boron sites with hydrogen bonds to adjacent silanols show superior durability and facilitate synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

Understanding these reaction mechanisms and the importance of site distribution can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on creating catalysts with a higher proportion of defect boron sites, aggregated boron species, and optimized hydrogen bonding, researchers can potentially develop more active and selective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not explicitly discuss the influence of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D distributions of active sites or specifically mention 1-D edge active sites. More research would be needed to fully understand the impact of these spatial arrangements on catalyst performance in ODHP reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，表面上的含氧硼位点对催化ODH反应至关重要。完全嵌入沸石骨架的孤立硼单元被发现是无活性的，而缺陷硼位点和聚集硼物种对催化ODHP反应至关重要，并且在丙烷的C-H键活化方面更有效。

这些位点的独特性质，特别是具有氢键能力的位点，有助于提高催化剂性能。例如，与相邻硅醇形成氢键的孤立硼位点表现出优异的耐久性，并促进氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

理解这些反应机制和位点分布的重要性可以指导更高效催化剂的设计。通过专注于创建具有更高比例缺陷硼位点、聚集硼物种和优化氢键的催化剂，研究人员可能开发出更活跃、更选择性的商业ODHP应用催化剂。

然而，文献并未明确讨论1-D、2-D和3-D活性位点分布的影响，也没有特别提到1-D边缘活性位点。需要进行更多研究以充分理解这些空间排列对ODHP反应中催化剂性能的影响。
