[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[3] "Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17% prior to the catalytic tests. Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material"

[5] "Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on the performance of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to infer potential impacts.

The study shows that various B-containing materials, including 2D structures like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and 3D structures like boron carbide (B4C) and metal borides, all catalyze the ODHP reaction with similar product distributions. This suggests that the dimensionality of the bulk structure may not be the primary factor determining catalyst performance.

The research indicates that the active sites for these catalysts are likely BOx species formed on the surface during the ODHP reaction. The density and distribution of these active sites appear to be influenced by the crystal structure of the material. Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species.

The study does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites or their unique properties. Instead, it suggests that the surface oxidation and formation of BOx species are key factors in catalyst performance, regardless of the bulk material's dimensionality.

Understanding the relationship between crystal structure, surface boron concentration, and BOx formation could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, more research is needed to fully elucidate the impact of spatial distribution and dimensionality on catalyst performance in ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些相关信息，可以用来推断潜在的影响。

研究表明，各种含硼材料，包括二维结构如六方氮化硼（hBN）和三维结构如碳化硼（B4C）和金属硼化物，都能催化ODHP反应，并且产物分布相似。这表明体相结构的维度可能不是决定催化剂性能的主要因素。

研究指出，这些催化剂的活性位点可能是在ODHP反应过程中在表面形成的BOx物种。这些活性位点的密度和分布似乎受到材料晶体结构的影响。层状硼化物（如NiB、TiB2、hBN）可能呈现出与四方硼化物（如WB、Co2B）不同的表面硼浓度，从而可能影响BOx物种的形成。

该研究并未特别讨论一维边缘活性位点或其独特性质。相反，它表明表面氧化和BOx物种的形成是催化剂性能的关键因素，而不考虑体相材料的维度。

理解晶体结构、表面硼浓度和BOx形成之间的关系可能有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，还需要更多研究来充分阐明空间分布和维度对ODHP反应中催化剂性能的影响。
