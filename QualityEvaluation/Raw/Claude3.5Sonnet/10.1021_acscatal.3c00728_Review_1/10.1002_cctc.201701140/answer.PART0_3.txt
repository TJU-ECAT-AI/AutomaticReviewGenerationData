[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively."

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

[4] "Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalysts' performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites in boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity in all tested boride catalysts. This implies that the dimensionality of the active sites may be less important than previously thought, with the focus shifting to surface-stabilized sites rather than edge sites.

The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boride materials may influence the formation of BOx species during ODH. Layered borides (2D structures) and tetragonal borides (3D structures) are mentioned as potentially presenting different boron surface concentrations, which could affect the formation of active sites. This suggests that the spatial distribution and dimensionality of the catalyst structure may indirectly influence performance by affecting the concentration and distribution of active sites on the surface.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, it does highlight the importance of surface-stabilized BOx sites in the catalytic process. This knowledge could potentially be used to develop catalysts with optimized surface structures and compositions to maximize the formation of these active sites, thereby improving catalytic performance in commercial applications.

该文献并没有直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

研究否定了之前关于边缘位点是氮化硼催化剂活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在所有测试的硼化物催化剂中，表面稳定的BOx活性位点负责催化活性。这意味着活性位点的维度可能不如之前认为的那么重要，焦点转移到表面稳定的位点而不是边缘位点。

研究表明，硼化物材料的晶体结构可能影响ODH过程中BOx物种的形成。文中提到层状硼化物（2D结构）和四方硼化物（3D结构）可能呈现不同的硼表面浓度，这可能影响活性位点的形成。这表明催化剂结构的空间分布和维度可能通过影响表面活性位点的浓度和分布间接影响性能。

虽然研究没有明确讨论理解这些特性如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，但它确实强调了表面稳定BOx位点在催化过程中的重要性。这些知识可能用于开发具有优化表面结构和成分的催化剂，以最大化这些活性位点的形成，从而提高商业应用中的催化性能。
