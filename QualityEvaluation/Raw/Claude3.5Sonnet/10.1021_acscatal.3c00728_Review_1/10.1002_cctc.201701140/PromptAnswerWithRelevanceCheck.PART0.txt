[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information about how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts specifically influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does challenge previous assumptions about the importance of edge sites and suggests that the crystal structure of the material may play a role in determining active site density and catalytic performance.

The study disproves earlier hypotheses that edge sites on boron nitride are the active sites for ODHP reactions. Instead, it proposes that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are formed on all tested boride catalysts, regardless of their bulk structure or non-boron constituent elements. This suggests that the dimensionality of the catalyst (1-D, 2-D, or 3-D) may be less important than previously thought for determining catalytic activity.

The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boron-based materials may influence the extent of surface oxidation and thus the density of active sites. Layered borides (such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (like WB and Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH reactions.

While the study does not directly address the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, the insights into the nature of the active sites and the influence of crystal structure on their formation could contribute to future catalyst design. Understanding that the active sites are surface-stabilized BOx species, rather than edge sites, may guide researchers to focus on maximizing the formation of these sites regardless of the catalyst's dimensionality.

这篇文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何具体影响其在ODHP反应中的性能的详细信息。然而，它确实挑战了之前关于边缘位点重要性的假设，并表明材料的晶体结构可能在决定活性位点密度和催化性能方面起作用。

研究否定了早期关于氮化硼边缘位点是ODHP反应活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在所有测试的硼化物催化剂上都形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点，而不考虑其体相结构或非硼成分元素。这表明催化剂的维度（1-D、2-D或3-D）可能不如之前认为的那样重要。

研究表明，硼基材料的晶体结构可能影响表面氧化的程度，从而影响活性位点的密度。层状硼化物（如NiB、TiB2和hBN）可能呈现出与四方硼化物（如WB和Co2B）不同的硼表面浓度，这可能影响ODH反应过程中BOx物种的形成。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及商业应用中更高效催化剂的设计，但对活性位点性质和晶体结构对其形成影响的见解可能有助于未来的催化剂设计。了解活性位点是表面稳定的BOx物种，而不是边缘位点，可能会引导研究人员专注于最大化这些位点的形成，而不考虑催化剂的维度。

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalyst performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights that challenge previous assumptions about the role of edge sites and suggest a more uniform surface-based mechanism.

The study disproves earlier hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it proposes that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity across various boron-containing materials, regardless of their structure or non-boron constituents.

The research indicates that the surfaces of all tested catalysts are enriched with boron and oxygen atoms, suggesting that the active sites are primarily two-dimensional surface features rather than one-dimensional edge sites. This surface-based mechanism appears to be consistent across different boron-containing materials, including those with varying crystal structures and compositions.

The study does not specifically address how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the findings suggest that focusing on optimizing surface BOx species formation and stability, rather than edge site engineering, may be more productive for improving catalyst performance.

The research also challenges the importance of BOH species, indicating they may not be present in significant quantities during the reaction and might form only upon exposure to ambient moisture. This insight could influence future catalyst design strategies by shifting focus away from hydroxyl group formation.

Overall, while the study does not directly answer the question about spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, it provides valuable insights that could guide future research and catalyst design efforts for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些见解，挑战了先前关于边缘位点作用的假设，并提出了一种更加统一的表面基反应机制。

研究驳斥了之前关于边缘位点是氮化硼催化剂活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在各种含硼材料中，表面稳定的BOx活性位点负责催化活性，不受材料结构或非硼成分的影响。

研究表明，所有测试催化剂的表面都富含硼和氧原子，这意味着活性位点主要是二维表面特征，而非一维边缘位点。这种表面基反应机制似乎在不同的含硼材料中都是一致的，包括那些具有不同晶体结构和成分的材料。

该研究并未具体讨论如何利用这些特性的理解来设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，研究结果表明，相比于边缘位点工程，关注优化表面BOx物种的形成和稳定性可能更有助于提高催化剂性能。

研究还质疑了BOH物种的重要性，指出它们在反应过程中可能不会大量存在，而可能只在暴露于环境湿气时形成。这一见解可能会影响未来催化剂设计策略，使研究重点从羟基形成转移。

总的来说，尽管该研究没有直接回答关于活性位点空间分布和维度的问题，但它提供了宝贵的见解，可以指导未来的研究和ODHP反应催化剂设计工作。

[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[3] "Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17% prior to the catalytic tests. Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material"

[5] "Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on the performance of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to infer potential impacts.

The study shows that various B-containing materials, including 2D structures like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and 3D structures like boron carbide (B4C) and metal borides, all catalyze the ODHP reaction with similar product distributions. This suggests that the dimensionality of the bulk structure may not be the primary factor determining catalyst performance.

The research indicates that the active sites for these catalysts are likely BOx species formed on the surface during the ODHP reaction. The density and distribution of these active sites appear to be influenced by the crystal structure of the material. Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species.

The study does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites or their unique properties. Instead, it suggests that the surface oxidation and formation of BOx species are key factors in catalyst performance, regardless of the bulk material's dimensionality.

Understanding the relationship between crystal structure, surface boron concentration, and BOx formation could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, more research is needed to fully elucidate the impact of spatial distribution and dimensionality on catalyst performance in ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些相关信息，可以用来推断潜在的影响。

研究表明，各种含硼材料，包括二维结构如六方氮化硼（hBN）和三维结构如碳化硼（B4C）和金属硼化物，都能催化ODHP反应，并且产物分布相似。这表明体相结构的维度可能不是决定催化剂性能的主要因素。

研究指出，这些催化剂的活性位点可能是在ODHP反应过程中在表面形成的BOx物种。这些活性位点的密度和分布似乎受到材料晶体结构的影响。层状硼化物（如NiB、TiB2、hBN）可能呈现出与四方硼化物（如WB、Co2B）不同的表面硼浓度，从而可能影响BOx物种的形成。

该研究并未特别讨论一维边缘活性位点或其独特性质。相反，它表明表面氧化和BOx物种的形成是催化剂性能的关键因素，而不考虑体相材料的维度。

理解晶体结构、表面硼浓度和BOx形成之间的关系可能有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，还需要更多研究来充分阐明空间分布和维度对ODHP反应中催化剂性能的影响。
