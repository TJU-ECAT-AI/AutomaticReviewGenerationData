          [1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

[5] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[6] "Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17% prior to the catalytic tests. Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."

          The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalyst performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides several relevant insights:

1. The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity across various boron-containing materials, regardless of their structure or non-boron constituents.

2. The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boron materials may influence the extent of surface oxidation and active site density. Layered borides (2D structures like NiB, TiB2, hBN) and tetragonal borides (3D structures like WB, Co2B) may present different boron surface concentrations, affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH.

3. Various B-containing materials, including 2D structures like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and 3D structures like boron carbide (B4C) and metal borides, all catalyze the ODHP reaction with similar product distributions. This suggests that the dimensionality of the bulk structure may not be the primary factor determining catalyst performance.

4. The study emphasizes the importance of surface-stabilized BOx sites in the catalytic process, rather than edge sites or specific dimensionality. The formation of these active sites appears to be a key factor in catalyst performance, regardless of the bulk material's dimensionality.

5. The research shows that upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase while concentrations of non-boron elements decrease, further supporting the importance of BOx species formation.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, the insights into the nature of active sites and the influence of crystal structure on their formation could guide future catalyst design efforts. Understanding the relationship between crystal structure, surface boron concentration, and BOx formation could potentially be used to develop catalysts with optimized surface structures and compositions to maximize the formation of these active sites, thereby improving catalytic performance in commercial applications.

          该文献并未直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它提供了几个相关的见解：

1. 研究否定了之前关于边缘位点是氮化硼催化剂活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在各种含硼材料中，表面稳定的BOx活性位点负责催化活性，不受材料结构或非硼成分的影响。

2. 研究表明，硼材料的晶体结构可能影响表面氧化程度和活性位点密度。层状硼化物（如NiB、TiB2、hBN的2D结构）和四方硼化物（如WB、Co2B的3D结构）可能呈现不同的硼表面浓度，从而影响ODH过程中BOx物种的形成。

3. 各种含硼材料，包括二维结构如六方氮化硼（hBN）和三维结构如碳化硼（B4C）和金属硼化物，都能催化ODHP反应，并且产物分布相似。这表明体相结构的维度可能不是决定催化剂性能的主要因素。

4. 研究强调了表面稳定BOx位点在催化过程中的重要性，而不是边缘位点或特定的维度。这些活性位点的形成似乎是催化剂性能的关键因素，而不考虑体相材料的维度。

5. 研究表明，在暴露于ODHP反应时，表面氧浓度增加，而非硼元素的浓度降低，进一步支持了BOx物种形成的重要性。

虽然研究没有明确讨论理解这些特性如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，但对活性位点性质和晶体结构对其形成影响的见解可能会指导未来的催化剂设计工作。理解晶体结构、表面硼浓度和BOx形成之间的关系可能用于开发具有优化表面结构和成分的催化剂，以最大化这些活性位点的形成，从而提高商业应用中的催化性能。
