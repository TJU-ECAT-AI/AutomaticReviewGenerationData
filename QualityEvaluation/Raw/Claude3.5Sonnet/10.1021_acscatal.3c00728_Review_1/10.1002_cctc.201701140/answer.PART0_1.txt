[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Instead, the surfaces of all the fresh catalysts are enriched with B and O atoms."

[5] "These observations suggest that BOH may not be present in significant quantities during the ODH reaction and rather may be formed upon hydration by ambient moisture."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalyst performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights that challenge previous assumptions about the role of edge sites and suggest a more uniform surface-based mechanism.

The study disproves earlier hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it proposes that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity across various boron-containing materials, regardless of their structure or non-boron constituents.

The research indicates that the surfaces of all tested catalysts are enriched with boron and oxygen atoms, suggesting that the active sites are primarily two-dimensional surface features rather than one-dimensional edge sites. This surface-based mechanism appears to be consistent across different boron-containing materials, including those with varying crystal structures and compositions.

The study does not specifically address how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, the findings suggest that focusing on optimizing surface BOx species formation and stability, rather than edge site engineering, may be more productive for improving catalyst performance.

The research also challenges the importance of BOH species, indicating they may not be present in significant quantities during the reaction and might form only upon exposure to ambient moisture. This insight could influence future catalyst design strategies by shifting focus away from hydroxyl group formation.

Overall, while the study does not directly answer the question about spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, it provides valuable insights that could guide future research and catalyst design efforts for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对B基催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些见解，挑战了先前关于边缘位点作用的假设，并提出了一种更加统一的表面基反应机制。

研究驳斥了之前关于边缘位点是氮化硼催化剂活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在各种含硼材料中，表面稳定的BOx活性位点负责催化活性，不受材料结构或非硼成分的影响。

研究表明，所有测试催化剂的表面都富含硼和氧原子，这意味着活性位点主要是二维表面特征，而非一维边缘位点。这种表面基反应机制似乎在不同的含硼材料中都是一致的，包括那些具有不同晶体结构和成分的材料。

该研究并未具体讨论如何利用这些特性的理解来设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，研究结果表明，相比于边缘位点工程，关注优化表面BOx物种的形成和稳定性可能更有助于提高催化剂性能。

研究还质疑了BOH物种的重要性，指出它们在反应过程中可能不会大量存在，而可能只在暴露于环境湿气时形成。这一见解可能会影响未来催化剂设计策略，使研究重点从羟基形成转移。

总的来说，尽管该研究没有直接回答关于活性位点空间分布和维度的问题，但它提供了宝贵的见解，可以指导未来的研究和ODHP反应催化剂设计工作。
