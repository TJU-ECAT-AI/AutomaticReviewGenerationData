[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

The literature does not provide detailed information about how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts specifically influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does challenge previous assumptions about the importance of edge sites and suggests that the crystal structure of the material may play a role in determining active site density and catalytic performance.

The study disproves earlier hypotheses that edge sites on boron nitride are the active sites for ODHP reactions. Instead, it proposes that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are formed on all tested boride catalysts, regardless of their bulk structure or non-boron constituent elements. This suggests that the dimensionality of the catalyst (1-D, 2-D, or 3-D) may be less important than previously thought for determining catalytic activity.

The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boron-based materials may influence the extent of surface oxidation and thus the density of active sites. Layered borides (such as NiB, TiB2, and hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (like WB and Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH reactions.

While the study does not directly address the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, the insights into the nature of the active sites and the influence of crystal structure on their formation could contribute to future catalyst design. Understanding that the active sites are surface-stabilized BOx species, rather than edge sites, may guide researchers to focus on maximizing the formation of these sites regardless of the catalyst's dimensionality.

这篇文献没有提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何具体影响其在ODHP反应中的性能的详细信息。然而，它确实挑战了之前关于边缘位点重要性的假设，并表明材料的晶体结构可能在决定活性位点密度和催化性能方面起作用。

研究否定了早期关于氮化硼边缘位点是ODHP反应活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在所有测试的硼化物催化剂上都形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点，而不考虑其体相结构或非硼成分元素。这表明催化剂的维度（1-D、2-D或3-D）可能不如之前认为的那样重要。

研究表明，硼基材料的晶体结构可能影响表面氧化的程度，从而影响活性位点的密度。层状硼化物（如NiB、TiB2和hBN）可能呈现出与四方硼化物（如WB和Co2B）不同的硼表面浓度，这可能影响ODH反应过程中BOx物种的形成。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及商业应用中更高效催化剂的设计，但对活性位点性质和晶体结构对其形成影响的见解可能有助于未来的催化剂设计。了解活性位点是表面稳定的BOx物种，而不是边缘位点，可能会引导研究人员专注于最大化这些位点的形成，而不考虑催化剂的维度。
