[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalyst performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides some relevant insights:

The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity across various boron-containing materials.

The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boron materials may influence the extent of surface oxidation and active site density. Layered borides (2D structures) and tetragonal borides (3D structures) may present different boron surface concentrations, affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH.

While the study does not specifically investigate 1D active sites, it emphasizes the importance of surface-stabilized BOx species rather than edge sites. This suggests that understanding the formation and properties of these surface sites, regardless of dimensionality, is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts.

The research does not provide specific insights into how understanding 1D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design for commercial applications. Instead, it highlights the importance of surface BOx species across various boron-containing materials with different crystal structures.

该文献并未直接讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度对基于硼的催化剂在ODHP反应中性能的影响。然而，它提供了一些相关的见解：

研究否定了之前关于边缘位点是氮化硼催化剂活性位点的假设。相反，它提出在各种含硼材料中，表面稳定的BOx活性位点负责催化活性。

研究表明，硼材料的晶体结构可能影响表面氧化程度和活性位点密度。层状硼化物（2D结构）和四方硼化物（3D结构）可能呈现不同的硼表面浓度，从而影响ODH过程中BOx物种的形成。

虽然研究没有具体调查1D活性位点，但它强调了表面稳定的BOx物种的重要性，而非边缘位点。这表明，无论维度如何，理解这些表面位点的形成和性质对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。

研究并未提供关于理解1D边缘活性位点如何有助于商业应用催化剂设计的具体见解。相反，它强调了在具有不同晶体结构的各种含硼材料中表面BOx物种的重要性。
