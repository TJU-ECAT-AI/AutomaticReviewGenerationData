[1] "Here, we extend this idea and develop a solvent-free liquid-phase catalyst supported on hollow spheres. We report sandwich-like B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres synthesized through a one-step template-free method."

[2] "At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C."

[3] "Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

[4] "Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in the B2O3@BPO4 catalyst significantly influence its performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The catalyst features a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, where melted B2O3 is supported on both the inside and outside of BPO4 hollow spheres. This structure maximizes the utilization of both sides of the support, which is uncommon in hollow-sphere structures.

The active sites in this catalyst are primarily 1-D, consisting of B2O3 nanowires covering the BPO4 hollow spheres. This 1-D structure likely provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites, contributing to the catalyst's excellent performance. The melted B2O3 at reaction temperatures above 450°C acts as the catalytically active species, allowing for efficient ODHP reactions.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The sandwich-like structure and the use of melted B2O3 as an active species demonstrate a novel approach to catalyst design, combining the advantages of supported liquid-phase catalysts with the benefits of hollow sphere supports. This approach results in excellent productivity (0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1) and high stability at 550°C, surpassing many metal-based catalysts.

The unique properties of this catalyst, including its metal-free composition, high-temperature stability, and efficient use of both inner and outer surfaces of the hollow spheres, contribute to its superior performance. These insights can guide the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications, focusing on optimizing spatial distribution, dimensionality, and the nature of active sites to enhance catalytic activity and stability.
