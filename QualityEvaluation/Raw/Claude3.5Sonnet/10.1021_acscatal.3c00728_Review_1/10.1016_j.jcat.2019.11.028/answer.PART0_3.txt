The literature does not provide detailed information about how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts specifically influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does describe a novel B2O3@BPO4 composite catalyst with a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. This structure consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires, which could be considered as 1-D active sites.

The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent catalytic performance in ODHP reactions, with high activity, selectivity, and stability at 550°C. Its productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1 was reported to be better than many metal-based catalysts. This suggests that the unique structure of the catalyst, particularly the 1-D B2O3 nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow spheres, contributes to its high efficiency in ODHP reactions.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss the reaction mechanisms of these sites, the high performance of this catalyst structure implies that the 1-D B2O3 nanowires may provide advantageous active sites for ODHP reactions. This insight could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by suggesting that incorporating 1-D structures or edge active sites in B-based catalysts might be beneficial for ODHP reactions.

However, more research would be needed to fully understand the specific influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on catalyst performance, and to elucidate the precise reaction mechanisms involved.

该文献并未提供关于B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何具体影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能的详细信息。然而，它确实描述了一种具有独特三明治状中空球结构的新型B2O3@BPO4复合催化剂。这种结构由BPO4中空球覆盖B2O3纳米线组成，可以被视为一维活性位点。

B2O3@BPO4复合物在ODHP反应中表现出优异的催化性能，在550°C下具有高活性、选择性和稳定性。其生产力高达0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1，据报道比许多金属基催化剂更好。这表明催化剂的独特结构，特别是覆盖BPO4中空球内外的一维B2O3纳米线，有助于其在ODHP反应中的高效性。

虽然该论文没有明确讨论这些位点的反应机理，但这种催化剂结构的高性能暗示一维B2O3纳米线可能为ODHP反应提供了有利的活性位点。这一见解可能有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，暗示在B基催化剂中纳入一维结构或边缘活性位点可能对ODHP反应有益。

然而，还需要更多的研究来充分理解活性位点的空间分布和维度对催化剂性能的具体影响，并阐明所涉及的精确反应机理。
