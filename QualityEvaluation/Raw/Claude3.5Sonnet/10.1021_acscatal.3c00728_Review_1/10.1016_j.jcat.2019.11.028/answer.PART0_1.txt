The document does not provide detailed information about the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that the B2O3@BPO4 catalyst has a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, with melted B2O3 supported on both the inside and outside of BPO4 hollow spheres. This structure allows for a high surface area and efficient utilization of the active B2O3 component.

The melted B2O3 supported on BPO4 acts as the catalytically active species at high temperatures (>450°C). This liquid-phase catalyst supported on a solid structure combines advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, allowing for controllable active centers and efficient product-catalyst separation.

The B2O3@BPO4 catalyst showed excellent performance in ODHP reactions, with high activity, selectivity, and stability at 550°C. Its productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1 surpassed many metal-based catalysts, demonstrating the potential of this metal-free B-based catalyst design for commercial applications.

While the document does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, the unique properties of this supported liquid-phase catalyst design contribute to its high performance. Understanding the reaction mechanisms and catalyst structure-property relationships could lead to further improvements in B-based catalyst designs for ODHP and other reactions.

该文档没有提供B基催化剂在ODHP反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度的详细信息。然而,它确实提到B2O3@BPO4催化剂具有独特的三明治状空心球结构,熔融B2O3支撑在BPO4空心球的内外表面上。这种结构允许高比表面积和活性B2O3组分的高效利用。

在高温(>450°C)下,支撑在BPO4上的熔融B2O3作为催化活性物种。这种液相催化剂支撑在固体结构上,结合了均相和多相催化的优点,允许可控的活性中心和高效的产物-催化剂分离。

B2O3@BPO4催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能,在550°C下具有高活性、选择性和稳定性。其0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1的生产率超过了许多金属基催化剂,展示了这种无金属B基催化剂设计在商业应用中的潜力。

虽然该文档没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点,但这种支撑液相催化剂设计的独特性质有助于其高性能。理解反应机理和催化剂结构-性能关系可能会导致ODHP和其他反应的B基催化剂设计的进一步改进。
