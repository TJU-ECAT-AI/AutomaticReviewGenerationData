The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about a novel B2O3@BPO4 catalyst with a unique structure.

The B2O3@BPO4 composite has a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, with BPO4 hollow spheres covered by B2O3 nanowires. This structure combines 3D hollow spheres with 1D nanowires, potentially providing a large surface area and unique active sites.

The catalyst showed excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with high activity, selectivity, and stability at 550°C. Its productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1 surpassed many metal-based catalysts.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, the unique sandwich-like structure combining 3D hollow spheres and 1D nanowires likely contributes to the catalyst's superior performance. The 1D B2O3 nanowires may provide edge active sites, which could play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these unique structures, especially the potential role of 1D edge active sites from B2O3 nanowires, could indeed contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. However, further research would be needed to fully elucidate these structure-performance relationships.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响ODHP反应的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于具有独特结构的新型B2O3@BPO4催化剂的相关信息。

B2O3@BPO4复合物具有三明治状的空心球结构，BPO4空心球被B2O3纳米线覆盖。这种结构结合了3D空心球和1D纳米线，可能提供了大的表面积和独特的活性位点。

该催化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能，在550°C下具有高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。其0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1的生产率超过了许多金属基催化剂。

虽然文档没有明确讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度的影响，但结合3D空心球和1D纳米线的独特三明治状结构可能是催化剂优异性能的原因。1D B2O3纳米线可能提供边缘活性位点，这可能在反应机理中起着关键作用。

理解这些独特结构的性质和反应机理，特别是B2O3纳米线可能提供的1D边缘活性位点的潜在作用，确实可以有助于设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂。然而，需要进一步的研究来充分阐明这些结构-性能关系。
