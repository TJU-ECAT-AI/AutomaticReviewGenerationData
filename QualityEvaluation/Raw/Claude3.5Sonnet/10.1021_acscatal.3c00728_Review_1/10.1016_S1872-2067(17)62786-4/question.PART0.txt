Selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene over a hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst
Abstract
Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%. Even at high conversion level of 63%, the selectivity of ethylene retained at 80%, which is competitive with the energy-demanding industrialized steam cracking route. A long-term test for 200 h resulted in stable conversion and product selectivity, showing the excellent catalytic stability. Both experimental and computational studies have identified that the hydrogen abstraction of B-OH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generated the active sites and triggered ethane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
Ethylene is one of the most important building blocks in chemical industry, with a global production capacity of 120 million metric tons per year [
1
]. Currently, the industrialized process for ethylene production is steam cracking of petroleum- and/or natural-gas-derived hydrocarbons at high-temperatures (approximately 800 C), inevitably involving tremendous energy consumption and significant emission of CO2 (11.6 ton CO2 per ton of ethylene) [
2
,
3
]. In addition, notable amount of carbon deposit formed under such harsh reaction conditions will cover the alloy tubes and halt the reaction, thus requiring frequent regeneration for cleaning the deposited coke [
4
].
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene represents a promising alternative to steam-cracking process, because of the favorable thermodynamic and kinetic characters, for example, exothermic, lower reaction temperature, faster reaction rate, and almost no coking [
5
,
6
]. In the past decades, this reaction has widely developed using the metal-based catalysts [
7
,
8
,
9
]. To date, the catalytic systems that could offer good performance mainly include Pt/Sn, SrFeO3δClσ, Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O, and MoVTeNbOx [
2
,
4
,
10
,
11
]. However, deep-oxidation over these metal-based catalysts caused significant decrease in the selectivity of ethylene [
12
]. Nanostructured carbon materials, representing one type of metal-free catalysts, have been shown as a competitive system in the ODH of hydrocarbons, but with very low conversion of ethane and propane at the temperature up to 500 C [
13
,
14
]. It is most likely that in the case of ODH of ethane, typically operating at 500700 C, carbon materials are fatally oxidized to CO2.
Boron nitride, also a type of metal-free catalysts, is characterized by the excellent structural and thermal stability under oxidative atmospheres [
15
,
16
]; and it has been demonstrated, quite recently, to selectively and efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane to propylene in the temperature up to 500 C [
17
]. Independently, our group demonstrated that hydroxlated boron nitride can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with long reaction stability ad extremely low CO2 formation [
18
]. As the ODH of ethane typically operates at higher temperatures than that of propane, catalysts with outstanding high-temperature oxidation resistance become the crucial issue. Herein, we report that hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) can efficiently catalyze the ODH of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity of ethylene (up to 95%) and excellent stability for 200-h test.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The boron nitride was hydroxylated by a sodium-assisted high-temperature steam activation process. Initially, sodium nitrite solution (200 μL, 1 mol L1) was incipient impregnated into boron nitride (1.0 g), followed by calcination in air at 560 C for 1 h. The solid product was then treated at 530 C with 5 vol% H2O/N2 for 3 h. Sodium ions were further leached out with a reflux in 3 mol L1 ammonia at 80 C for 3 times, followed extensive washing with ultrapure water (40 times, 50 mL water each). The obtained powders were treated in air at 500 C for 2 h. The obtained sample was named as BNOH.
2.2. Catalytic evaluation
Catalytic reactions were performed in a fixed-bed microreactor. The feed consists of C2H6/O2/N2 with a molar ratio of 1/1/4, and flow rate of reaction gas was fixed at 48 mL min1. The reaction temperature was varied in 550610 C. The reaction products were analyzed by online gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD. A GDX-102 and molecular sieve 5A column were used to analyze the O2, N2, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2. In kinetic analysis, the dependence of ethane conversion on reaction temperature was evaluated to calculate the apparent activation energy. Effect of contact time on reaction rate and product distribution was measured by varying reactant flow rates. Reaction orders were obtained by evaluating the effect of reactant partial pressure on reaction rates.
Conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon reacted. The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 5%. In order to account for the volume expansion in the reaction, nitrogen was used as the internal standard.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) were measured on a PANalytical Model X'Pert 3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). High-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements were performed on an FEI F30 microscope. Solid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer at 499.8 MHz using a 4-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. The chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS). Prior to testing, the sample was dehydrated at 400 C for 1 h at 104 Pa. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on Thermo VGE SCALAB250 analyzer. Monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1486.6 eV, anode operating at 15 kV and 150 W) was used as incident radiation. The binding energy of the element was calibrated using an C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.5 eV. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a quartz transmission cell. The gas composition at the reactor outlet during FT-IR experiments was controlled by online mass spectrometry (Pfeiffer, OminStarTM). Isotope-labelling experiments were carried out in a fixed bed microreactor. Initially, BNOH was treated at 590 C in He (40 mL min1) for 1 h, and then a 12-h H/D exchange was performed in a 3.5 vol% D2O/He stream. The BNOH after exchange was further purged using the dry He for 3 h. Subsequently, C2H6, O2 or a mixture of the two (800 μL each time) was pulsed into the deuterated BNOH with He as the carrier gas. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the reactor effluent were measured by online mass spectrometry.
2.4. Computational details
All stationary points were fully optimized using the B3LYP hybrid exchange-correlation functional as implemented in Gaussian 09 program with all atoms described by a double ξ quality basis set, 6-31G(d, p), followed by vibrational frequency analysis to identify the nature of the stationary points, either as minima or transition states. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were carried out to confirm that each transition state connects the two minima along the reaction pathway.
3. Results and discussion
ODH of ethane was performed in a packed-bed quartz microreactor under atmospheric pressure using a feed gas containing ethane, oxygen and nitrogen (1:1:4). The BNOH catalyst afforded surprisingly high selectivity and yield toward ethylene. For example, the selectivity to ethylene was as high as 95% at 11% ethane conversion, the byproduct consisted of CO (4.7%) and CO2 (0.4%) (
Fig. 1(a)
). As the conversion of ethane was increased to 40%, the selectivity of ethylene still was kept at 90%, which was superior to that over most of metal and metal oxide catalysts [
7
]. As further increasing the conversion of ethane to 63% by raising the reaction temperature, the selectivity of ethylene only slightly lowered to 80%, corresponding to an ethylene yield of 50%. This outstanding performance renders BNOH a comparable system with well-developed ethane steam cracking process in view of the 85% selectivity to ethylene at 60% conversion of ethane, but much superior considering the much lower reaction temperature and CO2 emission [

(a) Dependence of ethane conversion, ethylene selectivity and yield on the reaction temperature; (b) Effect of space velocity and reaction temperature on the productivity of ethylene; (c) Long-term stability test at 590 C. Reaction conditions: catalyst, 100 mg; gas feed, 16.7 vol% C2H6, 16.7 vol% O2, and N2 balance; 570610 C; space velocity 6.432.0 gC2H6 gcat1 h1.
Notably, only negligible amount of CO2, as the over-oxidation product, was formed over the BNOH catalyst even when ethane conversion reached 63% (
Fig. 1(a)
), clearly showing the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in selective activation of the CH bond in ethane. The effect of contact time on product distribution in ethane ODH further revealed that ethylene was the only primary product at the near-zero contact time, while selectivity to the byproduct CO approached to zero, evidencing that the BNOH catalyst intrinsically avoids the cleavage of CC in ethane under the ODH conditions.
The BNOH catalyst also can afford high ethylene productivity, (i.e., grams of C2H4 formed per gram of catalyst per hour). As shown in
Fig. 1(b)
, an unprecedented ethylene productivity (9.1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1) with >90% selectivity was achieved over the BNOH catalyst by mediating the reaction conditions. Such productivity far exceeds the critical value, 1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1, which would be commercially attractive [
7
]. The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of ethane was evidenced by the operation for 200 h at 590 C, during which no obvious variations in the conversion and product selectivity was detected (
Fig. 1(c)
), demonstrating its potential for industrial application.
Structure evolution of the BNOH catalysts before and after ODH of ethane was characterized. XRD pattern (
Fig. 2(a)
) showed that the BNOH catalyst still retained the typical hexagonal layered structure after a 200-h reaction. As observed by TEM, the morphology and lattice fringe of the spent BNOH catalyst kept similar as the original ones (
Fig. 2(b)
). XPS analysis revealed that 8.3 atom% surface oxygen present in the spent BNOH catalyst, slightly higher than that (6.9 atom%) of the fresh one (
Fig. 2(d)
). Solid-state 1H NMR spectra further revealed that the amount of BOH groups in the BNOH catalyst remained unchanged even after a 200-h reaction test (
Fig. 2(c)
). These results further confirm that the BNOH catalyst is stable under the ethane ODH reaction conditions.

Furthermore, we tracked the dynamic evolution of B-OH groups under the ethane ODH reaction conditions using the FT-IR spectroscopy. As seen in
Fig. 3
(a), the characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at 3400 cm1 [
17
,
18
,
19
,
20
]. Upon exposure to C2H6 atmosphere at 590 C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged (
Fig. 3(a)
), and no ethane conversion was detected. With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C2H6/N2), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened (
Fig. 3(a)
), accompanied with the formation of ethylene, indicating that the OH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction system. The intensities of hydroxyl vibrational stretches were recovered upon steam activation (
Fig. 3(a)
), suggesting that the OH groups could be readily regenerated.

Isotope-labelling experiments further confirmed the catalytic role of the BOH groups in ethane ODH reaction. When only O2 was pulsed into the deuterated BNOH(D) catalyst at 590 C, no species containing H or D atom were detected, suggesting that no activation of molecular oxygen occurred on the surface BOH(D) group. Similarly, no product appeared as well when only pulsing C2H6 into the deuterated BNOH(D) catalyst (
Fig. 3(b)
), indicating no chemical interaction between C2H6 and surface BOH(D) groups, and revealing the bridging oxygen bonded at the BNOH edge being unreactive for the ethane CH activation. In contrast, when a mixture of C2H6 and O2 was pulsed into the reaction chamber, besides the formation of ethylene and H2O, both HDO and D2O were also generated immediately (
Fig. 3(c)
), clearly indicating that the H/D atoms in the BNOH(D) catalyst were abstracted during the ODH reaction process. In subsequent pulses, the intensities of HDO and D2O gradually decreased whilst the intensity of H2O increased (
Fig. 3(c)
). This experiment verified the dynamic exchange between the H atoms in ethane and the edge of BNOH catalyst and the BOH groups as the active sites.
In line with this, kinetic experiments were performed to obtain deep insights on the reaction pathway of ethane ODH over the BNOH catalyst.
Fig. 4
shows the effect of reactant concentrations on the converting rate of ethane. Langmuir-type (L-type) dependence on oxygen concentration corresponds with a reaction mechanism controlled by O2 activation on the catalyst surface (
Fig. 4(a)
), which is consistent with the observations by FT-IR and isotope-labelling experiments. The second-order dependence on ethane concentration suggested that gaseous ethane might react directly with the activated oxygen species on the catalyst surface (
Fig. 4(b)
). The increase in selectivity as increasing oxygen concentration (
Fig. 4(c) and (d)
) reveals that molecular oxygen favors the formation of ethylene. The apparent activation energy of ethane was estimated to be 241.7 kJ mol1. These kinetic behaviors are intrinsically different from traditional metal oxide catalysts which typically follow the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [
21
,
22
].

Based on catalytic, spectroscopic and kinetic data, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to understand the underlying possible reaction pathway. All computational details and results were presented in
Fig. 5
. Based on the experimental studies, the hydroxylated boron nitride was considered as the resting state of the catalyst. In the presence of O2 at high temperature, the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, leading to the generation of two radical species, BNO* and HO2* radicals with a free energy barrier of 2.06 eV and endothermicity of 1.80 eV. The BNO* radical displays reactivity towards the hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5* radical. The free energy barrier was calculated to be 0.10 eV and the reaction is exothermic by 0.54 eV. The subsequent dehydrogenation of C2H5* radical, either by O2 or H2O2, offers the primary product, C2H4. Along this pathway, the dehydrogenation of the BOH sites appears as the rate-determining step. The HO2* radical, either formed by the oxidation of BNOH or C2H5*, may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane via a free energy barrier of 0.93 eV. Accordingly, molecular oxygen plays crucial role in the ODH of ethane. It first abstracts one H atom from the BNOH to generate the BNO* active species and triggers the ODH of ethane, and it may also react with C2H5* to assist the formation of ethylene. This explains the L-type O2-dependence observed in kinetic experiments (
Fig. 4(a)
). As seen in
Fig. 4(a), (c), (d)
, increasing the partial pressure of O2 favours the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene, suggesting the participation of O2 in the consumption of the C2H5* intermediate to produce ethylene when sufficient amount of O2 is present in the reaction chamber. Moreover, the activation pathway of ethane with edge BNO* and surface HO2* species nicely support the second-order rate dependence with respect to ethane concentrations in the ODH reaction over the BNOH catalyst (
Fig. 4(b)
).

4. Conclusions
We demonstrate that boron nitride upon hydroxylation exhibits a superior selectivity to ethylene but only small amount of CO2 formation in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. Based on experimental and computational studies, a possible reaction pathway was proposed that the hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generated the active sites, and triggered ethane dehydrogenation. This novel metal-free catalyst system enriches our knowledge on catalytic activation of alkanes and serves as a promising catalyst for the industrial ODH process.
