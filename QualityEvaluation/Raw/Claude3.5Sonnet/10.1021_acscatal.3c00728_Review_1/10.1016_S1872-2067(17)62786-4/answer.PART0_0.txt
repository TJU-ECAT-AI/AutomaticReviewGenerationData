[1] "Boron nitride, also a type of metal-free catalysts, is characterized by the excellent structural and thermal stability under oxidative atmospheres"

[2] "Herein, we report that hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) can efficiently catalyze the ODH of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity of ethylene (up to 95%) and excellent stability for 200-h test."

[3] "Based on experimental and computational studies, a possible reaction pathway was proposed that the hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generated the active sites, and triggered ethane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The study focuses on hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, not propane. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided.

The study indicates that the active sites in BNOH catalysts are the BOH groups at the edges of the boron nitride structure. These edge sites can be considered as 1-D active sites. The hydrogen abstraction from these BOH groups by molecular oxygen generates the active sites that trigger the dehydrogenation reaction.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of edge functionalization in boron nitride-based catalysts. The high selectivity and stability demonstrated by the BNOH catalyst in ethane dehydrogenation suggest that similar principles could be applied to develop catalysts for ODHP reactions.

The study also emphasizes the role of hydroxyl groups in creating active sites, which could guide future catalyst design strategies. By focusing on enhancing the number and accessibility of edge sites, and optimizing the hydroxylation process, researchers may be able to develop more efficient B-based catalysts for various dehydrogenation reactions, including ODHP.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。该研究主要关注羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)用于乙烷的氧化脱氢，而非丙烷。然而，我们可以从提供的信息中得到一些见解。

研究表明，BNOH催化剂中的活性位点是氮化硼结构边缘的BOH基团。这些边缘位点可以被视为一维活性位点。分子氧从这些BOH基团中提取氢原子，生成触发脱氢反应的活性位点。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的催化剂，突出了氮化硼基催化剂中边缘功能化的重要性。BNOH催化剂在乙烷脱氢中表现出的高选择性和稳定性表明，类似的原理可能适用于开发ODHP反应的催化剂。

该研究还强调了羟基在创建活性位点中的作用，这可能为未来的催化剂设计策略提供指导。通过专注于增加边缘位点的数量和可及性，并优化羟基化过程，研究人员可能能够开发出更高效的B基催化剂，用于各种脱氢反应，包括ODHP。
