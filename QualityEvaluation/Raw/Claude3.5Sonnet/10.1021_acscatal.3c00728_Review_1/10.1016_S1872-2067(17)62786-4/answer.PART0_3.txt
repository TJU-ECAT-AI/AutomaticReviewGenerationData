[1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

[2] "Notably, only negligible amount of CO2, as the over-oxidation product, was formed over the BNOH catalyst even when ethane conversion reached 63% (Fig. 1(a)), clearly showing the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in selective activation of the CH bond in ethane."

[3] "Based on catalytic, spectroscopic and kinetic data, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to understand the underlying possible reaction pathway."

[4] "Based on the experimental studies, the hydroxylated boron nitride was considered as the resting state of the catalyst. In the presence of O2 at high temperature, the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, leading to the generation of two radical species, BNO* and HO2* radicals"

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

The study highlights the importance of edge BOH groups in the catalyst's activity. These edge sites can be considered as 1-D active sites. The reaction mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of these edge BOH groups by O2, generating BNO* and HO2* radicals. These radical species then participate in the activation of ethane.

Understanding this mechanism involving 1-D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by emphasizing the importance of maximizing the exposure of edge sites in boron nitride-based catalysts. This could potentially be applied to improve catalysts for ODHP as well.

The high selectivity and low CO2 formation observed in this study suggest that the 1-D edge sites of BNOH are effective at selectively activating C-H bonds while minimizing over-oxidation. This property could be valuable for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, including ODHP.

While the study doesn't directly compare 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D active sites, it demonstrates the effectiveness of catalysts with prominent 1-D edge sites. This suggests that focusing on exposing more edge sites could be a promising strategy for improving B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in general.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。这项研究主要关注使用羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)催化剂进行乙烷的氧化脱氢。然而，我们可以从所提供的信息中得出一些见解：

研究强调了催化剂边缘BOH基团的重要性。这些边缘位点可以被视为一维活性位点。反应机理涉及这些边缘BOH基团被O2脱氢，生成BNO*和HO2*自由基。这些自由基物种随后参与乙烷的活化。

理解这种涉及一维边缘活性位点的机制有助于催化剂设计，强调了在氮化硼基催化剂中最大化边缘位点暴露的重要性。这可能也适用于改进ODHP的催化剂。

本研究观察到的高选择性和低CO2生成表明，BNOH的一维边缘位点能够有效地选择性活化C-H键，同时最小化过度氧化。这一特性对于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂（包括ODHP）可能很有价值。

虽然该研究没有直接比较一维、二维和三维活性位点，但它证明了具有显著一维边缘位点的催化剂的有效性。这表明，专注于暴露更多边缘位点可能是改进B基催化剂用于氧化脱氢反应的一个有前景的策略。
