[1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

[2] "Independently, our group demonstrated that hydroxlated boron nitride can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with long reaction stability ad extremely low CO2 formation"

[3] "Structure evolution of the BNOH catalysts before and after ODH of ethane was characterized. XRD pattern (Fig. 2(a)) showed that the BNOH catalyst still retained the typical hexagonal layered structure after a 200-h reaction."

[4] "Based on catalytic, spectroscopic and kinetic data, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to understand the underlying possible reaction pathway."

[5] "Based on the experimental studies, the hydroxylated boron nitride was considered as the resting state of the catalyst. In the presence of O2 at high temperature, the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, leading to the generation of two radical species, BNO* and HO2* radicals"

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, we can infer some information about the active sites in boron nitride catalysts for the related reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).

The study focuses on hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) as a catalyst for ODHE. The active sites appear to be primarily located at the edges of the boron nitride structure, where BOH groups are present. These edge sites can be considered as 1-D active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, creating BNO* and HO2* radicals. These radical species then participate in the activation of ethane molecules. This suggests that understanding the properties and behavior of these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for improving catalyst performance.

The hexagonal layered structure of the boron nitride catalyst is maintained throughout the reaction, indicating that the 2-D planar structure of the material is important for catalyst stability. However, the active sites themselves appear to be primarily 1-D edge features.

While this study focuses on ODHE rather than ODHP, the insights gained about the importance of edge sites and the reaction mechanism involving BOH groups could potentially be applied to the design of more efficient catalysts for ODHP and other related reactions. Understanding how to optimize the distribution and properties of these 1-D edge active sites could lead to improved catalyst performance in terms of selectivity, conversion, and stability.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。但是，我们可以从相关的乙烷氧化脱氢(ODHE)反应中推断出一些关于硼氮催化剂活性位点的信息。

这项研究主要关注羟基化硼氮(BNOH)作为ODHE的催化剂。活性位点似乎主要位于硼氮结构的边缘，那里存在BOH基团。这些边缘位点可以被视为一维活性位点。

反应机理涉及O2对边缘BOH基团的脱氢，生成BNO*和HO2*自由基。这些自由基物种随后参与乙烷分子的活化。这表明，了解这些一维边缘活性位点的性质和行为对于提高催化剂性能至关重要。

硼氮催化剂的六方层状结构在整个反应过程中保持不变，这表明材料的二维平面结构对催化剂的稳定性很重要。然而，活性位点本身主要是一维边缘特征。

虽然这项研究主要关注ODHE而不是ODHP，但关于边缘位点重要性和涉及BOH基团的反应机理的见解可能适用于ODHP和其他相关反应的更高效催化剂设计。了解如何优化这些一维边缘活性位点的分布和性质可能会导致催化剂在选择性、转化率和稳定性方面的性能改进。
