[1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

[2] "Independently, our group demonstrated that hydroxlated boron nitride can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with long reaction stability ad extremely low CO2 formation"

[3] "Structure evolution of the BNOH catalysts before and after ODH of ethane was characterized. XRD pattern (Fig. 2(a)) showed that the BNOH catalyst still retained the typical hexagonal layered structure after a 200-h reaction."

[4] "Furthermore, we tracked the dynamic evolution of B-OH groups under the ethane ODH reaction conditions using the FT-IR spectroscopy."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study focuses on hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, not propane.

However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

The BNOH catalyst retains a hexagonal layered structure, suggesting a 2D configuration. The active sites appear to be primarily the B-OH groups at the edges of the boron nitride sheets. These edge sites can be considered 1D in nature.

The performance of the BNOH catalyst is impressive, with high selectivity and stability. This suggests that the 1D edge active sites are highly effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

The reaction mechanism involves the dynamic evolution of B-OH groups, where they interact with molecular oxygen to create active sites for the dehydrogenation process. This understanding of the reaction mechanism at the edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of accessible hydroxyl groups and their interaction with oxygen.

While this study focuses on ethane, the principles could potentially be applied to propane dehydrogenation as well. The success of this catalyst design suggests that focusing on enhancing and optimizing 1D edge active sites in 2D materials could be a promising approach for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts for commercial applications.

该文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。这项研究主要关注羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)用于乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢，而非丙烷。

然而，从所提供的信息中可以得出一些见解：

BNOH催化剂保持六方层状结构，表明其为2D构型。活性位点主要是氮化硼片层边缘的B-OH基团。这些边缘位点可以被视为1D性质。

BNOH催化剂的性能令人印象深刻，具有高选择性和稳定性。这表明1D边缘活性位点对氧化脱氢反应高度有效。

反应机理涉及B-OH基团的动态演变，它们与分子氧相互作用以创建脱氢过程的活性位点。对边缘位点反应机理的这种理解有助于设计更高效的催化剂，突出了可接近的羟基基团及其与氧气相互作用的重要性。

虽然这项研究集中在乙烷上，但这些原理可能也适用于丙烷脱氢。这种催化剂设计的成功表明，专注于增强和优化2D材料中的1D边缘活性位点可能是开发更高效的ODHP催化剂用于商业应用的一种有前景的方法。
