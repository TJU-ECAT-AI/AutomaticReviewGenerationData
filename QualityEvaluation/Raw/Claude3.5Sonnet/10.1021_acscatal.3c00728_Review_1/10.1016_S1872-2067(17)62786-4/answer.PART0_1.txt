[1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does provide insights into the behavior of hydroxylated boron nitride catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, which may be relevant to ODHP reactions.

The study focuses on hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) as a catalyst, which contains hydroxyl groups at the edges. These edge BOH groups play a crucial role in the catalytic process. The research suggests that the active sites are primarily located at the edges of the boron nitride structure, indicating a 1-D distribution of active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, generating BNO* and HO2* radicals. These radicals then participate in the activation of ethane and its subsequent conversion to ethylene. This understanding of the reaction pathway at the edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of edge functionalization and the role of hydroxyl groups.

While the study focuses on ethane dehydrogenation, the insights gained could be applicable to propane dehydrogenation as well. The high selectivity and low CO2 formation observed in this catalyst system suggest that understanding and optimizing the edge active sites could lead to improved catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, researchers could focus on:

1. Maximizing the number of edge sites in boron nitride-based materials
2. Optimizing the hydroxylation process to increase the density of active BOH groups
3. Exploring other edge functionalization strategies that might enhance catalytic performance
4. Investigating the stability and regeneration of edge active sites under reaction conditions

These approaches, based on the understanding of 1-D edge active sites, could contribute to the development of more effective and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions.

虽然这篇文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度，但它确实提供了关于羟基化氮化硼催化剂在乙烷氧化脱氢中行为的见解，这可能与ODHP反应相关。

研究主要关注含有边缘羟基的羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)催化剂。这些边缘BOH基团在催化过程中起着关键作用。研究表明，活性位点主要位于氮化硼结构的边缘，表明活性位点呈1D分布。

反应机理涉及边缘BOH基团被O2脱氢，生成BNO*和HO2*自由基。这些自由基随后参与乙烷的活化及其向乙烯的转化。对边缘位点反应途径的理解有助于设计更高效的催化剂，突出了边缘功能化和羟基作用的重要性。

虽然这项研究集中在乙烷脱氢上，但所获得的见解也可能适用于丙烷脱氢。该催化剂体系观察到的高选择性和低CO2生成表明，理解和优化边缘活性位点可能导致改进的商业ODHP应用催化剂。

为了设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，研究人员可以关注：

1. 最大化氮化硼基材料中的边缘位点数量
2. 优化羟基化过程以增加活性BOH基团的密度
3. 探索可能增强催化性能的其他边缘功能化策略
4. 研究反应条件下边缘活性位点的稳定性和再生

这些基于对1D边缘活性位点理解的方法，可能有助于开发更有效和选择性的ODHP反应催化剂。
