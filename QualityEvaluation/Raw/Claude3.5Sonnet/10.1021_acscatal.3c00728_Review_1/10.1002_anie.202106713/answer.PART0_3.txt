[1] "Featured by exothermicity, free of thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, and no coking, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane becomes an attractive competitor in contrast to direct dehydrogenation (DH)."

[2] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[3] "With the investigation of various boron-containing catalysts in different alkane atmospheres, it has been generally accepted that the oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of the catalyst is the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction."

[4] "Interestingly, as shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[5] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides some insights into the nature of active sites and their influence on catalyst performance:

1. The study focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, which are 2D materials. The active sites are primarily located on the surface of these 2D sheets.

2. Oxygen-containing boron species on the catalyst surface are identified as the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction.

3. N-defects, particularly three-boron center (TBC) defects, play a crucial role in catalyst performance. These defects evolve into active BOx species during the ODH reaction.

4. There is a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC), suggesting that these defects are more important for catalytic activity than g2 defects (one-boron center, OBC).

5. The study mentions that aggregated boron is favored to become active sites, which might imply that the spatial distribution of these sites affects catalyst performance.

While the study does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, the focus on surface defects and their evolution into active species contributes to understanding the reaction mechanisms. This knowledge can be applied to design more efficient catalysts by optimizing the creation and distribution of these active sites on the catalyst surface.

虽然文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂在ODHP反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度，但它提供了一些关于活性位点性质及其对催化剂性能影响的见解：

1. 该研究主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂，这是一种2D材料。活性位点主要位于这些2D片层的表面。

2. 催化剂表面的含氧硼物种被确定为ODH反应的催化来源。

3. N缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷，在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。这些缺陷在ODH反应过程中演变为活性BOx物种。

4. 反应速率与g1缺陷（TBC）强度之间存在正相关，表明这些缺陷对催化活性的影响比g2缺陷（单硼中心，OBC）更重要。

5. 研究提到聚集的硼更容易成为活性位点，这可能暗示这些位点的空间分布会影响催化剂性能。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论1-D边缘活性位点，但对表面缺陷及其演变为活性物种的关注有助于理解反应机理。这些知识可以应用于设计更高效的催化剂，通过优化催化剂表面这些活性位点的创建和分布。
