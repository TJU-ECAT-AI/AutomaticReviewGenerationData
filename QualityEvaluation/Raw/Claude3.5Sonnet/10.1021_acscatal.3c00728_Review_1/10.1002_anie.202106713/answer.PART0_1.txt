[1] "Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."

[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[4] "The outcome indicated that N2-BN displayed the best performance, of which propane conversion of 26.0% and selectivity of 76.7% toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C."

[5] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[6] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The study does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into how different types of defects influence catalyst performance.

The research focuses on using plasma treatments to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). N2 plasma treatment was found to be most effective, creating three-boron center (TBC) N-defects that significantly improved catalytic activity. These TBC defects were shown to correlate positively with reaction rates, suggesting they play a crucial role in the ODH reaction.

The study indicates that the aggregation of boron atoms at these defect sites is favorable for creating active sites. During the ODH reaction, these N-defects evolve into BOx species, which are believed to be the active sites for propane conversion to propylene.

While the research doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D distributions of active sites, it does highlight the importance of surface defects and their evolution under reaction conditions. This understanding contributes to catalyst design by emphasizing the need to create and control specific types of defects, particularly TBC N-defects, to enhance catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

The study's approach of using plasma treatments to selectively create these defects provides a method for tailoring the catalyst surface, which could be applied in developing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, more research would be needed to fully understand how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of these active sites affect overall catalyst performance.

这项研究并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响。但是，它提供了关于不同类型缺陷如何影响催化剂性能的见解。

研究重点是使用等离子体处理来修改六方氮化硼（h-BN）的局部化学环境。N2等离子体处理被发现是最有效的，它创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，显著提高了催化活性。这些TBC缺陷被证明与反应速率呈正相关，表明它们在ODH反应中起着关键作用。

研究表明，在这些缺陷位点聚集硼原子有利于形成活性位点。在ODH反应过程中，这些N缺陷演变成BOx物种，被认为是将丙烷转化为丙烯的活性位点。

虽然研究没有明确讨论活性位点的1-D、2-D或3-D分布，但它确实强调了表面缺陷及其在反应条件下的演变的重要性。这种理解有助于催化剂设计，强调了创造和控制特定类型缺陷（特别是TBC N缺陷）以提高ODHP反应中的催化性能的必要性。

研究使用等离子体处理选择性地创造这些缺陷的方法，为定制催化剂表面提供了一种方法，这可以应用于开发更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，还需要更多的研究来充分理解这些活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响催化剂的整体性能。
