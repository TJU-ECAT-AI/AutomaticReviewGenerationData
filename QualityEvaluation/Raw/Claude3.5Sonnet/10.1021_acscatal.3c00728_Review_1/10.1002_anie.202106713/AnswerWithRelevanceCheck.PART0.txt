          [1] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[2] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[3] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

[4] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[5] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[6] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, which are 2D materials with active sites primarily located on the surface.

Key findings include:

1. Three-boron center (TBC) N-defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion.
2. There is a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC), suggesting these defects are more important for catalytic activity than g2 defects (one-boron center, OBC).
3. Aggregated boron sites are favored to become active sites, implying that the spatial distribution of these sites affects catalyst performance.
4. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C.
5. The dimensionality of the catalyst structure impacts performance, as demonstrated by the reduced activity of O2-BN due to sintering of BN nanosheets.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Highlighting the importance of creating and maintaining TBC N-defects.
2. Emphasizing the need to prevent sintering and maintain the 2D structure of BN nanosheets.
3. Suggesting that methods to increase the concentration of edge sites, where TBC defects are more likely to form, could enhance catalytic performance.
4. Demonstrating the potential of plasma treatment as a method for selectively creating desired defect structures.

While the study does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, the emphasis on TBC defects and their evolution into active BOx species under ODH conditions suggests that edge sites, where such defects are more likely to occur, could be particularly important for catalytic activity.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。该研究主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂，这是一种2D材料，活性位点主要位于表面。

主要发现包括：

1. 三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。
2. 反应速率与g1缺陷（TBC）强度之间存在正相关，表明这些缺陷对催化活性的影响比g2缺陷（单硼中心，OBC）更重要。
3. 聚集的硼位点更容易成为活性位点，这暗示这些位点的空间分布会影响催化剂性能。
4. N2处理的BN显示出显著的活性，在520°C下丙烷转化率达26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。
5. 催化剂结构的维度影响性能，这从O2-BN由于BN纳米片烧结而导致活性降低可以看出。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，通过：

1. 强调创建和维持TBC N缺陷的重要性。
2. 强调防止烧结和保持BN纳米片2D结构的必要性。
3. 提出增加边缘位点浓度的方法（TBC缺陷更可能形成的地方）可能会增强催化性能。
4. 展示了等离子体处理作为选择性创建所需缺陷结构方法的潜力。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论1D边缘活性位点，但对TBC缺陷及其在ODH条件下演变为活性BOx物种的强调表明，边缘位点（这种缺陷更可能发生的地方）对催化活性可能特别重要。
