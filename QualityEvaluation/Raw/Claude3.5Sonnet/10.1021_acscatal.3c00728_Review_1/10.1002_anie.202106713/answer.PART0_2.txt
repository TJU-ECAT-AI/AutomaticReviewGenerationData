[1] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[2] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[3] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."

[4] "Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study primarily focuses on the role of N-defects, particularly three-boron center (TBC) N-defects, which are found to be crucial in facilitating propane conversion.

The research indicates that aggregated boron sites, represented by the g1 defect (TBC), play a leading role in the ODH reaction compared to the g2 defect (one-boron center, OBC). This suggests that the spatial arrangement of boron atoms in a three-dimensional configuration is more favorable for catalytic activity.

The dimensionality of the catalyst structure also impacts performance. For instance, the sintering of BN nanosheets in O2-treated samples reduced the utilization of active B sites, despite having a higher oxygen concentration. This implies that maintaining the 2D structure of the BN nanosheets is important for maximizing the accessibility of active sites.

The study does not explicitly discuss 1D edge active sites. However, the emphasis on TBC defects and their evolution into active BOx species under ODH conditions suggests that edge sites, where such defects are more likely to occur, could be particularly important for catalytic activity.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Highlighting the importance of creating and maintaining TBC N-defects.
2. Emphasizing the need to prevent sintering and maintain the 2D structure of BN nanosheets.
3. Suggesting that methods to increase the concentration of edge sites, where TBC defects are more likely to form, could enhance catalytic performance.
4. Demonstrating the potential of plasma treatment as a method for selectively creating desired defect structures.

This knowledge can guide the development of synthesis methods and treatments that optimize the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, potentially leading to more efficient and commercially viable ODHP catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。该研究主要关注N缺陷的作用，特别是三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这被发现对促进丙烷转化至关重要。

研究表明，由g1缺陷（TBC）代表的聚集硼位点在ODH反应中发挥主导作用，相比g2缺陷（单硼中心，OBC）更为重要。这表明硼原子在三维构型中的空间排列更有利于催化活性。

催化剂结构的维度也会影响性能。例如，O2处理样品中BN纳米片的烧结减少了活性B位点的利用，尽管其具有更高的氧浓度。这意味着保持BN纳米片的2D结构对于最大化活性位点的可及性很重要。

该研究没有明确讨论1D边缘活性位点。然而，对TBC缺陷及其在ODH条件下演变为活性BOx物种的强调表明，边缘位点（这种缺陷更可能发生的地方）对催化活性可能特别重要。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，通过：

1. 强调创建和维持TBC N缺陷的重要性。
2. 强调防止烧结和保持BN纳米片2D结构的必要性。
3. 提出增加边缘位点浓度的方法（TBC缺陷更可能形成的地方）可能会增强催化性能。
4. 展示了等离子体处理作为选择性创建所需缺陷结构方法的潜力。

这些知识可以指导开发优化B基催化剂中活性位点空间分布和维度的合成方法和处理方法，可能导致更高效和商业可行的ODHP催化剂。
