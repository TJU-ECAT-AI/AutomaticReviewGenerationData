[1] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[4] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[5] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature and importance of active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts.

The study focuses on the role of defects, particularly nitrogen defects, in enhancing the catalytic activity of h-BN for ODHP. Three-boron center (TBC) N-defects were found to play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. These defects, created through plasma treatment, evolve into active BOx species under reaction conditions.

The research suggests that the aggregation of boron atoms at these defect sites is favorable for catalytic activity. This implies that the spatial distribution of active sites is important, with clustered or aggregated sites potentially being more effective than isolated ones.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D distributions of active sites, it does highlight the importance of surface modifications and defect creation in improving catalyst performance. The use of plasma treatment to selectively create defects and modify the local chemical environment of h-BN demonstrates an approach to tailoring the distribution and nature of active sites.

Understanding these active sites and their formation mechanisms contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of controlled defect creation and the role of specific types of defects (e.g., TBC N-defects) in catalytic activity. This knowledge can guide the development of more efficient catalysts by focusing on methods to create and optimize the distribution of these active sites.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论B基催化剂在ODHP反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。然而，它确实提供了一些关于六方氮化硼(h-BN)催化剂中活性位点的性质和重要性的见解。

研究重点关注了缺陷，特别是氮缺陷，在增强h-BN催化剂ODHP活性方面的作用。研究发现，三硼中心(TBC)N缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。这些通过等离子体处理创造的缺陷在反应条件下演变成活性BOx物种。

研究表明，硼原子在这些缺陷位点的聚集有利于催化活性。这意味着活性位点的空间分布很重要，聚集或聚合的位点可能比孤立的位点更有效。

虽然研究没有明确讨论活性位点的1-D、2-D或3-D分布，但它确实强调了表面修饰和缺陷创造在提高催化剂性能方面的重要性。使用等离子体处理来选择性地创造缺陷和修改h-BN的局部化学环境，展示了一种定制活性位点分布和性质的方法。

理解这些活性位点及其形成机制有助于催化剂设计，强调了控制缺陷创造的重要性以及特定类型缺陷（如TBC N缺陷）在催化活性中的作用。这些知识可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，重点关注创造和优化这些活性位点分布的方法。
