[1] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[2] "High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

[3] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[4] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the influence of active site properties on catalyst performance:

1. Surface modifications and etching are crucial for improving catalyst activity and understanding reaction mechanisms.

2. Plasma treatment can modify the surface properties and composition of catalysts by breaking and forming chemical bonds.

3. The study found a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (three-boron center N-defects), suggesting that these defects play a leading role in the ODH reaction.

4. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment, with TBC (three-boron center) defects potentially evolving into active BOx species during the ODH reaction.

While the literature does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, it emphasizes the importance of defect sites and their evolution in improving catalyst performance. Understanding these defect structures and their reactivity could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. However, more research would be needed to fully address the question of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts.

该文献并没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于活性位点性质对催化剂性能影响的见解：

1. 表面改性和刻蚀对于提高催化剂活性和理解反应机理至关重要。

2. 等离子体处理可以通过断裂和形成化学键来改变催化剂的表面性质和组成。

3. 研究发现反应速率与g1缺陷(三硼中心N缺陷)强度呈正相关，表明这些缺陷在ODH反应中起主导作用。

4. 等离子体处理过程中产生了两种类型的N缺陷(TBC和OBC)，其中TBC(三硼中心)缺陷可能在ODH反应过程中演变为活性BOx物种。

虽然该文献没有具体讨论一维边缘活性位点，但它强调了缺陷位点及其演变在提高催化剂性能方面的重要性。理解这些缺陷结构及其反应性可能有助于设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂。然而，要全面解答B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度问题，还需要更多的研究。
