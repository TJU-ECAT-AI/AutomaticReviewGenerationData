[1] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[2] "High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

[3] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[4] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the influence of active site properties on catalyst performance:

1. Surface modifications and etching are crucial for improving catalyst activity and understanding reaction mechanisms.

2. Plasma treatment can modify the surface properties and composition of catalysts by breaking and forming chemical bonds.

3. The study found a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (three-boron center N-defects), suggesting that these defects play a leading role in the ODH reaction.

4. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment, with TBC (three-boron center) defects potentially evolving into active BOx species during the ODH reaction.

While the literature does not specifically discuss 1-D edge active sites, it emphasizes the importance of defect sites and their evolution in improving catalyst performance. Understanding these defect structures and their reactivity could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. However, more research would be needed to fully address the question of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts.

The study does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into how different types of defects influence catalyst performance.

The research focuses on using plasma treatments to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). N2 plasma treatment was found to be most effective, creating three-boron center (TBC) N-defects that significantly improved catalytic activity. These TBC defects were shown to correlate positively with reaction rates, suggesting they play a crucial role in the ODH reaction.

The study indicates that the aggregation of boron atoms at these defect sites is favorable for creating active sites. During the ODH reaction, these N-defects evolve into BOx species, which are believed to be the active sites for propane conversion to propylene.

While the research doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D distributions of active sites, it does highlight the importance of surface defects and their evolution under reaction conditions. This understanding contributes to catalyst design by emphasizing the need to create and control specific types of defects, particularly TBC N-defects, to enhance catalytic performance in ODHP reactions.

The study's approach of using plasma treatments to selectively create these defects provides a method for tailoring the catalyst surface, which could be applied in developing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. However, more research would be needed to fully understand how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of these active sites affect overall catalyst performance.

这项研究并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应性能的影响。但是，它提供了关于不同类型缺陷如何影响催化剂性能的见解。

研究重点是使用等离子体处理来修改六方氮化硼（h-BN）的局部化学环境。N2等离子体处理被发现是最有效的，它创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，显著提高了催化活性。这些TBC缺陷被证明与反应速率呈正相关，表明它们在ODH反应中起着关键作用。

研究表明，在这些缺陷位点聚集硼原子有利于形成活性位点。在ODH反应过程中，这些N缺陷演变成BOx物种，被认为是将丙烷转化为丙烯的活性位点。

虽然研究没有明确讨论活性位点的1-D、2-D或3-D分布，但它确实强调了表面缺陷及其在反应条件下的演变的重要性。这种理解有助于催化剂设计，强调了创造和控制特定类型缺陷（特别是TBC N缺陷）以提高ODHP反应中的催化性能的必要性。

研究使用等离子体处理选择性地创造这些缺陷的方法，为定制催化剂表面提供了一种方法，这可以应用于开发更高效的商业应用催化剂。然而，还需要更多的研究来充分理解这些活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响催化剂的整体性能。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study primarily focuses on the role of N-defects, particularly three-boron center (TBC) N-defects, which are found to be crucial in facilitating propane conversion.

The research indicates that aggregated boron sites, represented by the g1 defect (TBC), play a leading role in the ODH reaction compared to the g2 defect (one-boron center, OBC). This suggests that the spatial arrangement of boron atoms in a three-dimensional configuration is more favorable for catalytic activity.

The dimensionality of the catalyst structure also impacts performance. For instance, the sintering of BN nanosheets in O2-treated samples reduced the utilization of active B sites, despite having a higher oxygen concentration. This implies that maintaining the 2D structure of the BN nanosheets is important for maximizing the accessibility of active sites.

The study does not explicitly discuss 1D edge active sites. However, the emphasis on TBC defects and their evolution into active BOx species under ODH conditions suggests that edge sites, where such defects are more likely to occur, could be particularly important for catalytic activity.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Highlighting the importance of creating and maintaining TBC N-defects.
2. Emphasizing the need to prevent sintering and maintain the 2D structure of BN nanosheets.
3. Suggesting that methods to increase the concentration of edge sites, where TBC defects are more likely to form, could enhance catalytic performance.
4. Demonstrating the potential of plasma treatment as a method for selectively creating desired defect structures.

This knowledge can guide the development of synthesis methods and treatments that optimize the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, potentially leading to more efficient and commercially viable ODHP catalysts.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。该研究主要关注N缺陷的作用，特别是三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这被发现对促进丙烷转化至关重要。

研究表明，由g1缺陷（TBC）代表的聚集硼位点在ODH反应中发挥主导作用，相比g2缺陷（单硼中心，OBC）更为重要。这表明硼原子在三维构型中的空间排列更有利于催化活性。

催化剂结构的维度也会影响性能。例如，O2处理样品中BN纳米片的烧结减少了活性B位点的利用，尽管其具有更高的氧浓度。这意味着保持BN纳米片的2D结构对于最大化活性位点的可及性很重要。

该研究没有明确讨论1D边缘活性位点。然而，对TBC缺陷及其在ODH条件下演变为活性BOx物种的强调表明，边缘位点（这种缺陷更可能发生的地方）对催化活性可能特别重要。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机制有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，通过：

1. 强调创建和维持TBC N缺陷的重要性。
2. 强调防止烧结和保持BN纳米片2D结构的必要性。
3. 提出增加边缘位点浓度的方法（TBC缺陷更可能形成的地方）可能会增强催化性能。
4. 展示了等离子体处理作为选择性创建所需缺陷结构方法的潜力。

这些知识可以指导开发优化B基催化剂中活性位点空间分布和维度的合成方法和处理方法，可能导致更高效和商业可行的ODHP催化剂。
