Abstract
The assembly of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets into three-dimensional (3D) well-organized superstructures is one of the key topics in materials chemistry and physics, due to their potential applications in various fields. Herein, starting from the crystalline metal–organic framework (MOF) particles, a spherical superstructure consisting of metal–organic framework nanosheets (SS-MOFNSs) is synthesized via a simple solvothermal transformation process. After pyrolysis and nitrogenization in ammonia, the SS-MOFNSs are further transformed into the spherical superstructure consisting of boron nitride nanosheets (SS-BNNSs), which preserve the original spherical superstructure morphology. Taking advantage of this unique superstructure, the resulting SS-BNNSs exhibit excellent catalytic activity for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene and ethylene. The results of this work provide a novel synthetic strategy to fabricate 3D spherical superstructures consisting of 2D nanosheets for high-performance applications in catalysis, energy storage, as well as other related fields.

Introduction
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), a structural analogue of graphite, has attracted significant research interests due to its superb thermal/chemical stabilities, high thermal conductivity, excellent optoelectronic properties, and intrinsic electrical insulation. (1,2) Their controlled nanoarchitectures, such as 0D nanoparticles, (3,4) 1D nanotubes, (5,6) 2D nanosheets, (7,8) and 3D nanoporous structures, (9,10) are very promising for applications in various areas including sensors, (11) pollutant removal, (12,13) and thermal-conductive polymers. (14,15) In addition to these traditional properties-driven applications, h-BN has recently been found to be a break-through catalyst for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce propylene and ethylene, (16) essential building blocks (>250 million metric tons per year) in the production of various chemicals. (17) For instance, it was reported that h-BN could catalyze ODHP with high propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) selectivity at a propane conversion of 14%. (16) Edge hydroxylated h-BN exhibited an enhanced propylene selectivity (80.2%) at a propane conversion of 20.6%. (18) These results present a new metal-free catalyst for selective cleavage of C–H bonds and provide a promising alternative to meet the increasing gap between demand and supply of olefins.
Although outstanding ODHP performance has been achieved by h-BN, the olefin yield is still not satisfactory for practical applications, because the olefin selectivity at high propane conversion is still relatively low. In general, the olefin yield must be higher than 30% for the commercial viability of a process. (19−21) Thus, research efforts on h-BN catalysts still have to be spent toward higher activity and higher olefin yield. Since oxygen-containing boron sites on the edges of h-BN are decisive for its unique catalytic function in the ODHP reaction, (22,23) maximizing the number of oxygen-containing boron sites by nanostructural engineering may be the most effective option to improve the catalytic activity of h-BN. (24) Constructing hierarchical 3D architectures, (25,26) especially spherical organization based on 2D h-BN nanosheets, is an effective strategy for exploring more edge active sites and, therefore, is highly desirable for improving the catalytic activity of h-BN. Nevertheless, although various techniques have been reported for the synthesis of h-BN nanostructures with controllable size and morphology, (2,27) no synthetic strategy has been developed for controlling the assembly of 2D h-BN nanosheets into a 3D spherical superstructure.
The main target of this study is to synthesize a spherical superstructure of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (SS-BNNSs). Using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as self-sacrificial templates has recently been proven to be a promising strategy to prepare spherical superstructures. (28) The MOFs are a kind of emerging material of metal ions coupled with organic linkers. (29−31) The thermal transformation of MOFs is an efficient strategy to produce carbon and carbon-based materials, (32,33) metal oxides, (34−36) metal chalcogenides, (37,38) metal phosphides, and metal carbides with controlled morphology. (39−42) Up to now, there is no precedent that MOFs can produce h-BN materials due to the less existence of MOFs materials containing abundant boron atoms. In this work, we newly design a new kind of boron-containing MOF with a novel spherical superstructure composed of nanosheets (SS-MOFNSs), which can be easily transformed to SS-BNNSs by nitrogenization under an ammonia atmosphere (Figure 1). The as-prepared SS-BNNSs with preserved spherical superstructure afford an olefin yield of 40.2% (propylene 27.8% and ethylene 12.4%), which is the highest in ODHP using h-BN-based catalysts.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates the synthetic process for SS-MOFNSs and SS-BNNSs. In general, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles (Figure S1) were chosen as the precursor to produce SS-MOFNSs. Through a solvothermal transformation process at 150 °C, ZIF-8 nanoparticles reacted with boric acid and formed SS-MOFNSs. Annealing SS-MOFNSs at 1000 °C under an ammonia atmosphere, preserving their original morphology, gave rise to the formation of SS-BNNSs with 2D h-BN nanosheets assembled into 3D spherical superstructure.
The XRD pattern of as-achieved SS-MOFNSs is entirely different from that of ZIF-8 (Figure S2), indicating the formation of a new MOF, whose composition is determined to be Zn2(BO3)1(C4N2H5)1 by elemental analysis (Table S1). The structure of this boron-containing MOF (denoted as MBON-1, MBON represents metal-borate-organic network) can be successfully determined from the powder X-ray diffraction data. As shown in Figure 2a, the Rietveld refinement is in good agreement with the experimental XRD result with the profile factor of Rp = 3.1%, Rwp = 3.8%, and GOF = 1.793, which validates the crystal structure solution. The refined atomic position, equivalent isotropic displacement parameters, selected bond lengths, and bond angles of SS-MOFNSs are listed in Tables S2–S4. The resulting MOF (SS-MOFNSs) is crystallized in a trigonal space group P123 with cell parameters of a = 8.6527 Å, b = 8.6527 Å, and c = 15.0844 Å. Each Zn(II) metal center is coordinated by three oxygen donor atoms from borate ions and one nitrogen atom from 2-methylimidazole, leading to a four-coordinated pyramid geometry. Zn(II) ions and borate ions formed 2D graphene-like layers (denoted as ZnBO layers) consisting of irregular hexagon circles, as shown in Figure 2b. Each irregular hexagon circle is formed of one B atom, two Zn atoms, and three O atoms. The N atoms of 2-methylimidazole are connected by two Zn(II) ions in a monodentate form, which can link the 2D ZnBO layers along the z-axis in series and formed a 3D structure (Figure 2c, Figure S3).

The inset shows the corresponding pore size distribution.
The morphology of SS-MOFNSs was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 2d, the as-prepared SS-MOFNSs exhibit a 3D spherical superstructure (7–10 μm in diameter) with massive 2D MOF nanosheets (∼60 nm in thickness) ordered along the three directions (Figure 2e). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and pore volumes of SS-MOFNSs are 24.4 m2 g–1 and 0.13 cm3 g–1, respectively (Figure 2f), which are much lower than those of the starting ZIF-8 NPs (1799 m2 g–1, 0.94 cm3 g–1) (Figure S4), probably due to the different pore structures of SS-MOFNSs and ZIF-8. Figure S5 shows the TGA data of SS-MOFNSs. The first weak weight loss can be attributed to the loss of minute quantities of guest molecules, and the second weight loss is mainly the loss of methyl in 2-methylmidazole. The last rapid weight-loss step corresponds to the decomposition of organic ligands. The whole weight loss is about 30.6%, which agrees with the theoretical mass ratio of organic ligands (29.9%). The FT-IR and XPS results also agree with the crystal structure of SS-MOFNSs (Figures S6 and S7).
To understand the formation mechanism of SS-MOFNSs, we studied the transformation processes by temperature- and time-dependent control experiments (Figures S8 and S9). At 110 °C, the product maintains the original crystal structure of ZIF-8 (Figure S8a), showing the original nanoparticle morphology. However, some of the particles start to crack into small irregular particles (Figure S9a), indicating that ZIF-8 particles are partially decomposed. At 120 °C, the new phase appears. The SEM image (Figure S9b) reveals that all the ZIF-8 particles break down into small particles, and a small amount of 2D nanosheets appear. When the temperature increases to 130 °C, ZIF-8 particles are mostly converted to the new crystal phase, although the ZIF-8 peaks and the intermediate peaks still exist. Correspondingly, 2D nanosheets are found to be the main product, and few ZIF-8 particles can be observed from the SEM image (Figure S9c). The ZIF-8 particles completely disappear at temperatures higher than 140 °C (Figure S9d), leaving only a spherical superstructure consisting of 2D nanosheets (Figure S9d). At 150 °C, the XRD peaks derived from only the new phase of SS-MOFNSs can be observed (Figure S8a). The above temperature-dependent control experiments reveal that boric acid, due to its acidic nature, can etch ZIF-8 particles, (43) resulting in the slow decomposition of ZIF-8 particles when the temperature is above 110 °C. The boric acid reacts with the dissolved zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole, generating the new crystal phase from 120 °C.
Figures S8b and S10 illustrate the XRD patterns and SEM images of products obtained with different reaction times at 150 °C. The appearance of the new crystal phase starts at a reaction time of 3 h, resulting in the crack of nanoparticles and the generation of small irregular particles consisting of 2D nanosheets (Figure S10a). When the reaction time reaches 7 h, the new crystal phase becomes the main phase, showing the coexistence of flowerlike superstructures and detached nanosheets (Figure S10c). When the reaction time reaches 10 h (Figure S10d), the sample displays uniform spherical superstructures. The time-dependent control experiments show that individual MOFNSs are first formed in the morphology of detached nanosheets during the reaction. The detached nanosheets are assembled into small irregular superstructures and then uniform spherical superstructures with the extension of the reaction time. In brief, the above investigation indicates that the formation of SS-MOFNSs is a stepwise transformation process. The slow dissolution of ZIF-8 particles provides a continuous supply of low-concentration zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole, which react with boric acid at a slow growth rate and lead to the formation of MOFNSs. On the contrary, directly heating zinc nitrate hexahydrate, 2-methylimidazole, and boric acid in methanol yields nanosheets with random shapes and sizes (Figure S11), which could be attributed to the rapid nucleation of the MOF in a high reactant concentration.
Annealing of SS-MOFNSs at 1000 °C under dynamic ammonia atmosphere for 6 h produced the well-defined SS-BNNSs. The XRD results in Figure 3a reveal the formation of a highly crystallized h-BN structure. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.7° and 42.1° correspond to the (002) and (100) planes of h-BN, respectively. No peaks corresponding to Zn and Zn-related compounds can be observed, which reveals that Zn is entirely absent from SS-BNNSs. The SEM image illustrates that SS-BNNSs preserve the original morphology of SS-MOFNSs with 2D h-BN nanosheets assembled into a 3D spherical superstructure (Figure 3b). The diameter of SS-BNNSs is 7–10 μm (Figure S12), consistent with that of SS-MOFNSs. However, the thickness of nanosheets decreases 25–30 nm (Figure 3c), which is attributed to the decomposition of organic ligands. Some pores appear on the BN nanosheets (white circle in Figure 3c), verifying the departure of the volatile components. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure S13) confirm that the interior of SS-BNNSs possesses a porous structure. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image indicates dozens of h-BN (002) layers within the nanosheets, with an interlayer crystal lattice spacing of 0.35 nm corresponding to the (002) crystal planes of h-BN (Figure 3e). (44,45) The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm (Figure 3f) indicates that SS-BNNSs have similar type-IV isotherms with that of SS-MOFNSs but possess a much higher BET surface area of 476 m2 g–1 and pore volume of 1.87 cm3 g–1. The pore size distribution of SS-BNNSs contains abundant mesopores in the range 5–40 nm. Such open mesopores of SS-BNNSs provide effective channels for gas diffusion, which is advantageous for the contact between reactant gases and active sites on the catalysts. The SEM elemental mapping (Figure S14) reveals the uniform distribution of boron, nitrogen, and oxygen.

XPS data provide the specific contents and the detailed chemical states of the elements on the surface of SS-BNNSs. The XPS survey spectrum (Figure 4a) shows that SS-BNNSs mainly contain boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and some C impurity, whose contents are listed in Table S5. The content of oxygen reached 4.03 atom %, indicating massive oxygen species on the surface of SS-BNNSs. The N 1s spectrum (Figure 4b) is fitted as N–B3 (398.1 eV) and HN–B2 (400.0 eV) species. (7,46) The B 1s spectrum (Figure 4c) can be fitted into two peaks at 190.4 and 191.9 eV, arising from the signal of B in B–N and B–OH bonds, respectively. (7,47) The peaks in the O 1s spectrum (Figure 4d) can be perfectly fitted into B–OH species (532.6 eV). (18,47,48) The C impurity can be attributed to the C dopants in BN or the adsorbed organic pollutants (Figure S15a). A Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis was also carried out to identify the functional groups of SS-BNNSs further. As illustrated in Figure 4e, the peaks at ∼3400 and ∼1170 cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibration of OH and B–O, which also confirms the existence of B–OH species. (16,47) These results reveal that SS-BNNSs contain massive oxygen-containing boron species on the surface (Figure S15b), which have been reported as useful active sites for the ODHP reaction. (18,49) TGA data under the air atmosphere revealed the excellent oxidation resistance of SS-BNNSs. As shown in Figure 4f, SS-BNNSs exhibit no weight loss even though the temperature went up to 800 °C. A little upward trend occurring from 800 °C resulted from the oxidation of BN to produce the corresponding oxides (B2O3). (50) The superior antioxidation ability under high temperature makes SS-BNNSs a valuable catalyst for the ODHP reaction.

Once prepared, SS-BNNSs are readily used as catalysts for ODHP without any further activation. The catalytic reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed microreactor (Figure S16). Figure 5a shows the ODHP catalytic performance of SS-BNNSs as a function of reaction temperature (450–515 °C). The conversion of propane was around 5% at 450 °C, while the selectivities of propylene and ethylene were 89% and 5%, respectively. When the reaction temperature rises to 490 °C, the propane conversion increases to 21%, and the selectivity of propylene and ethylene is 78% and 10%, which surpasses the performance of other previously published h-BN materials at the same reaction temperature (Table S6). At 510 °C, the conversion of propane has risen to 58%, and the propylene selectivity is still around 48%, yielding the maximum propylene yield of 27.8% (Figure 5b). Meanwhile, the ethylene selectivity increases to 21%, providing an ethylene yield of 12.4%. Thus, the overall olefin yield is 40.2%, which is the highest olefin yield achieved by h-BN-based catalysts so far (Table S6). The olefin yield continues to grow as the reaction temperature increases, but the propylene yield starts to reduce due to the cracking of propylene into ethylene at high temperature. It is more attractive that the CO2 selectivity is less than 2% throughout the whole process, and the byproducts are mainly ethylene and CO, which are both valuable feedstocks for a vast array of chemicals. (51,52) Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) affects the propane conversion and propylene selectivity as well (Figure S17a), and the reaction order of reaction gas (2.23 for propane and 0.77 for O2, Figure S17b) is in good agreement with the previous reports.

The long-term stability of SS-BNNSs for ODHP was conducted at 490 °C for 100 h (Figure 5c). The propane conversion is 20 ± 1% during the test, and the selectivity of propylene and ethylene stays at around 78 ± 1% and 10 ± 1%, respectively. The almost unchanged olefins selectivity reveal the outstanding stability of SS-BNNSs as a catalyst for ODHP. The carbon balance kept at 100 ± 3% during the long-term stability test (Figure S18), indicating excellent chemical stability of SS-BNNSs and ignorable coke deposition. Comparison of the physical and chemical properties of SS-BNNSs before (fresh) and after (spent) the ODHP test also shed light on the stability of SS-BNNSs catalyst. The SEM images (Figure S19) revealed that the diameter of SS-BNNSs is 7–10 μm, and the thickness of h-BN nanosheets is still 25–30 nm, indicating that SS-BNNSs keep the original morphology after the ODHP test. The XRD pattern of the SS-BNNSs-Spent (Figure S20) shows diffraction peaks ascribed to the (002) and (100) planes of h-BN, consistent with that of the fresh sample, revealing the permanent crystal structure. After the ODHP test, the SS-BNNSs still have a BET surface area of 439 m2 g–1 and a pore volume of 1.77 cm3 g–1 (Figure S21), proving the excellent mechanical stability. The surface properties of SS-BNNSs-Spent were characterized by XPS (Figure S22). The XPS survey spectrum of SS-BNNSs-Spent exhibits no significant change compared with that of the SS-BNNSs-Fresh (Figure 4a–d). The carbon content of SS-BNNSs-Spent is only 0.66 atom % (Table S7), illustrating ignorable coke deposition during the ODHP process. The N 1s, B 1s, and O 1s spectra of SS-BNNSs-Spent are nearly the same with those of fresh SS-BNNSs, suggesting the unchanged surface properties. Based on all the characterizations mentioned above, it is evident that SS-BNNSs exhibit outstanding stability during the long-term and high-temperature test, demonstrating the potential for industrial application. Moreover, almost the same catalytic performance is successfully obtained, when the SS-BNNSs-Spent sample is employed for the second run of the ODHP reaction, which revealed the outstanding repeatability of SS-BNNSs (Figure S23).
The assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures not only inherits the exceptional properties of their building blocks but also exhibits certain unconventional advantages caused by the unique 3D structures, thus rendering them attractive candidates for various applications. (53,54) For instance, 3D porous BN nanosheets reported by Li et al. exhibited much higher absorption capacities for organic pollutants than 2D BN nanosheets. (55) The unique 3D porous structure made of BN nanosheets with high-density adsorption sites is believed to play a key role in the excellent pollutant capture performance. Yang et al. synthesized 3D functionalized flowerlike boron nitride nanosheets (FBNNSs), which exhibited much higher NH3 and CO2 adsorption properties than 2D BN nanosheets. (56) The excellent adsorption properties are attributed to the efficient contact surface area and the high number of adsorption. To shed light on the structural advantage of SS-BNNSs, we compared the ODHP performance of SS-BNNSs with commercial h-BN nanosheets (C-BNNSs) and porous h-BN fibers (P-BNFs, Figure S24). Prior to the ODHP tests, C-BNNSs and P-BNFs need an activation process to arm B–OH species on the surface and achieve the optimized catalytic performance (Figure S25a). (49) However, having massive oxygen-containing boron species on the surface, SS-BNNSs can be used directly as a catalyst for ODHP without any activation (Figure S25b). As shown in Figure S26a, the unique structural design of SS-BNNSs results in much higher propane conversion than C-BNNSs. For example, at the same reaction temperature of 490 °C, SS-BNNSs obtain a propane conversion of 20.8%, while the propane conversion of C-BNNSs is only 12.7% (Figure 5d). Moreover, the propylene selectivity (78.1%) and ethylene selectivity (10.2%) of SS-BNNSs are also higher than those of C-BNNSs (76.2% for propylene and 8.3% for ethylene). Such high propane conversion and olefin selectivity of SS-BNNSs result in a much higher olefin yield than that of C-BNNSs (Figure 5e and Figure S26b,c). The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the high surface area and massive active sites of SS-BNNSs. As shown in Figure S27a, C-BNNSs exhibit a surface area of 23 m2 g–1, which is much lower than that of SS-BNNSs (439 m2 g–1). The in situ DRIFTS results prove that the oxygen-containing boron sites on SS-BNNSs are the active sites for ODHP (Figure S28). The integral areas of −OH species (∼3400 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectra) can be used to quantify the number of active sites. (24,49,57) As shown in Figure S29, the intensity of −OH vibrational stretches of SS-BNNSs is much higher than that of C-BNNSs, indicating that the high surface area of SS-BNNSs results in more active sites than C-BNNSs.
In addition to the surface area, the pore size distribution may also play an important part in the ODHP performance. To gain insight into the effect of the pore size distribution, we compared the ODHP performance of SS-BNNSs and high-surface-area porous h-BN fibers (P-BNFs). The surface area of P-BNFs is much higher (838 m2 g–1, Figure S27b) than that of SS-BNNSs (439 m2 g–1), but the ODHP performance of P-BNFs is much lower than that of SS-BNNSs (Figure 5e and Figure S26). For instance, the propane conversion of P-BNFs is only 13.7% at 490 °C (Figure 5d), much lower than that of SS-BNNSs (20.8%) at the same reaction temperature. The propylene selectivity (77.7%) and ethylene selectivity (8.5%) of P-BNFs are also lower than those of SS-BNNSs (78.1% for propylene and 10.2% for ethylene). Accordingly, P-BNFs exhibit a lower overall olefin yield than SS-BNNSs (Figure 5e). The mismatch between the surface area and the ODHP performance of P-BNFs can be explained by the unbefitting pore size distribution. Although P-BNFs have a high surface area, the surface area is mainly contributed by the micropores with pore sizes around 1 nm (Figure S27b). Such small micropores seriously block the diffusion of the reaction gases and limit the exposure of active sites. As shown in Figure S29, the integral areas of −OH species on P-BNFs is much lower than that of SS-BNNSs, even though P-BNFs have a higher surface area and are activated in the reaction conditions to arm active sites on the surface. (13,49) In contrast, the surface area of SS-BNNSs is mainly contributed by the mesopores with the pore sizes in the range 5–40 nm (Figure 3f), which means that the reactant can quickly diffuse in the pores of SS-BNNSs and reach the active sites easily. (57−62) Moreover, the unique 3D spherical superstructure explores most of the edge active sites of BNNSs to the top surface of SS-BNNSs. It allows effective contact between the reaction gases and the active sites without going inside the pores, which benefited the catalytic activity. Figure 5f shows the Arrhenius plot of all the samples, which gives the apparent activation energies (Ea). (63) It is found that the Ea of SS-BNNSs was 175.3 kJ mol–1, which is much lower than those of C-BNNSs (202.9 kJ mol–1), P-BNFs (195.7 kJ mol–1), and other previously reported h-BN catalysts, (16,18,64) further proving the high catalytic activity of SS-BNNSs. It is notable that template methods for preparing h-BN have the disadvantage of the possible existence of other elements. (65,66) For instance, our XPS results indicate that there are some carbon atoms (1.07 atom %) in SS-BNNSs. The impurities might affect the catalytic activity greatly. (67) Future research efforts will be directed toward understanding the contribution of the impurities on the catalytic performance.
Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a 3D spherical superstructure composed of 2D anisotropic MOF nanosheets via a solvothermal transformation of ZIF-8 nanoparticles. The boron-containing SS-MOFNSs can preserve the original morphology during the nitrogenization in ammonia, providing a 3D spherical superstructure of h-BN nanosheets rich in oxygen-containing boron active sites. The SS-BNNSs can be applied as an effective catalyst for ODHP without any further activation and achieve much-enhanced propane conversion and olefin selectivity compared with C-BNNSs and P-BNFs. Moreover, an excellent olefin yield of 40.2% (propylene 27.8% and ethylene 12.4%) is achieved using SS-BNNSs as a catalyst, surpassing all the previously reported h-BN catalysts. This newly developed method not only opens up a new route to prepare a 3D spherical superstructure of nanosheets for catalysis and other related fields but also provides an idea to improve the ODHP performance through structural engineering.
