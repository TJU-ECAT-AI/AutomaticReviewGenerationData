[1] "Hermans and co-workers found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed."

[4] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained"

[5] "Moreover, the preferential N-terminated edges proved to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds, via both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration."

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant insights into the nature of active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts and their influence on catalytic performance.

The study focuses on tailoring N-terminated defective edges of porous boron nitride for enhanced aerobic catalysis. It suggests that defective edges in h-BN are likely to be catalytically active sites, similar to those in graphene. The researchers developed a strategy to create artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a high specific surface area (SSA) of up to 1579 m2/g.

The N-terminated edges were found to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation reactions. This was confirmed through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration experiments. The creation of numerous pores in the BN structure allowed for a high SSA, which exposed more active sites in the pristine regions.

While the study doesn't specifically address ODHP reactions, it demonstrates that tailoring the edge structure and increasing the surface area of BN catalysts can significantly enhance their catalytic performance in aerobic oxidation reactions. This understanding of the relationship between edge structure, surface area, and catalytic activity could potentially be applied to the design of more efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions.

The research highlights the importance of 1-D edge active sites in BN catalysts, particularly N-terminated edges. By focusing on these specific sites and developing methods to increase their abundance and accessibility, it may be possible to design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, including ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氮化硼（BN）催化剂活性位点性质及其对催化性能影响的相关见解。

该研究重点关注了多孔氮化硼N端缺陷边缘的定制，以增强其有氧催化性能。研究表明，h-BN中的缺陷边缘可能是催化活性位点，类似于石墨烯中的活性位点。研究人员开发了一种策略，创造人工构建的N端边缘，并获得了高达1579 m2/g的比表面积（SSA）。

研究发现，N端边缘是有氧氧化反应中氧气活化的活性位点。这一点通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和化学滴定实验得到了证实。在BN结构中创造大量孔隙使得比表面积增加，从而暴露了更多原始区域的活性位点。

虽然该研究并未特别针对ODHP反应，但它表明，调整BN催化剂的边缘结构和增加表面积可以显著提高其在有氧氧化反应中的催化性能。这种对边缘结构、表面积和催化活性之间关系的理解，可能适用于ODHP反应更高效催化剂的设计。

研究强调了BN催化剂中1-D边缘活性位点的重要性，特别是N端边缘。通过关注这些特定位点并开发增加其丰度和可及性的方法，有可能设计出更高效的商业应用催化剂，包括用于ODHP反应的催化剂。
