The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts and their influence on catalytic performance in general.

The study focuses on the importance of defective edges in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as catalytically active sites. It suggests that the 1-D edge sites, particularly N-terminated edges, play a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity. The researchers found that creating abundant N-terminated defective edges and making them more accessible through a porous structure led to improved catalytic performance.

The dimensionality of active sites is indirectly addressed through the discussion of porous structures. By creating a porous BN material with a high specific surface area, more active sites are exposed, including those in pristine regions. This suggests that increasing the accessibility of active sites through 3-D porous structures can enhance catalytic performance.

The study also highlights the importance of understanding the unique properties of different types of edge sites (B-terminated, N-terminated, and armchair) in BN catalysts. Through DFT calculations and experimental validation, the researchers found that N-terminated edges were particularly effective for oxygen activation, which is crucial for oxidation reactions.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on ODHP reactions, it demonstrates that tailoring the edge structure and creating porous materials can significantly improve catalytic performance in aerobic oxidation reactions. This understanding could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, including ODHP, by focusing on optimizing the distribution and accessibility of active edge sites in B-based catalysts.

这篇文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氮化硼（BN）催化剂中活性位点的性质及其对催化性能影响的见解。

研究重点关注了六方氮化硼（h-BN）中缺陷边缘作为催化活性位点的重要性。它表明，1-D边缘位点，特别是N端边缘，在提高催化活性中起着关键作用。研究人员发现，创造大量N端缺陷边缘并通过多孔结构使其更容易接触，可以提高催化性能。

活性位点的维度通过对多孔结构的讨论间接得到了解决。通过创建具有高比表面积的多孔BN材料，更多的活性位点被暴露出来，包括那些在原始区域的位点。这表明，通过3-D多孔结构增加活性位点的可接触性可以提高催化性能。

研究还强调了理解BN催化剂中不同类型边缘位点（B端、N端和扶手结构）的独特性质的重要性。通过DFT计算和实验验证，研究人员发现N端边缘对氧气活化特别有效，这对氧化反应至关重要。

虽然这项研究并未特别关注ODHP反应，但它表明，调整边缘结构和创建多孔材料可以显著提高有氧氧化反应的催化性能。这种理解可能有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，包括ODHP，通过专注于优化B基催化剂中活性边缘位点的分布和可接触性。
