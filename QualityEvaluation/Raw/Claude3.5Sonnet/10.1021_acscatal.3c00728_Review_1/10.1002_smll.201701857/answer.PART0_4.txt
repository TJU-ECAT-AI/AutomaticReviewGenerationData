[1] "Hermans and co-workers found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "For generating abundant active sites, an agent-assisted synthesis is an efficient strategy to achieve this target, but such a strategy has not been reported in the field of h-BN catalysts."

[4] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed."

[5] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature suggests that defective edges in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are catalytically active sites, similar to graphene. This implies that 1-D edge active sites play a crucial role in the catalytic activity of B-based materials.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Increased active site density: By focusing on edge sites, researchers can develop strategies to increase the number of active sites per unit area, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity.

2. Tailored edge termination: The study demonstrates that N-terminated edges can be artificially constructed, which may allow for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

3. Improved accessibility: Creating porous structures with high specific surface areas (up to 1579 m2/g in this study) exposes more active sites, enhancing overall catalytic performance.

4. Rational design approach: Understanding the role of edge sites allows for targeted synthesis methods, such as the agent-assisted synthesis mentioned in the literature, to create catalysts with optimized active site distributions.

5. Performance comparison: Knowing that h-BN can perform comparably to industrial vanadium oxide catalysts in ODHP reactions provides a benchmark for developing improved B-based catalysts.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can design B-based catalysts with optimized spatial distributions of 1-D edge active sites, potentially leading to more efficient and commercially viable catalysts for ODHP and other related reactions.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，六方氮化硼(h-BN)中的缺陷边缘是催化活性位点，类似于石墨烯。这意味着一维边缘活性位点在B基材料的催化活性中起着关键作用。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 增加活性位点密度：通过关注边缘位点，研究人员可以开发策略来增加单位面积的活性位点数量，可能导致更高的催化活性。

2. 定制边缘终端：研究表明可以人工构建N端接边缘，这可能允许对催化性能进行精细调整。

3. 提高可及性：创建具有高比表面积的多孔结构（本研究中高达1579 m2/g），暴露更多活性位点，提高整体催化性能。

4. 理性设计方法：了解边缘位点的作用允许采用有针对性的合成方法，如文献中提到的助剂辅助合成，以创建具有优化活性位点分布的催化剂。

5. 性能比较：了解h-BN在ODHP反应中可与工业钒氧化物催化剂相媲美，为开发改进的B基催化剂提供了基准。

通过利用这些见解，研究人员可以设计具有优化一维边缘活性位点空间分布的B基催化剂，可能导致ODHP和其他相关反应更高效和商业可行的催化剂。
