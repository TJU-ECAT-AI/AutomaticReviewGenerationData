[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that the armchair structure was the catalytic active sites by theoretical calculation but not experimentally proved."

[2] "Hence, we suggest that the active site for current reaction on P-BN may be the N-terminated zigzags around pores."

[3] "To give direct evidence of the above conclusion, chemical titration was employed. To verify whether the active sites were located at edges, we used a ball-milled g-BN (g-BN-B) as the catalyst, which had more exposed edges than pristine g-BN."

[4] "These results showed that N-terminated edge sites are active sites, which is consistent with the DFT results. With abundant N-terminated edges from the Zn templates, the prepared P-BNs showed quite satisfying catalytic performance."

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts on ODHP reactions. However, it does provide insights into the importance of edge active sites, particularly N-terminated edges, in boron nitride catalysts for aerobic oxidation reactions.

The study focuses on tailoring N-terminated defective edges of porous boron nitride (P-BN) to enhance aerobic catalysis. It demonstrates that N-terminated edge sites are the active sites for oxygen activation, which is crucial for oxidation reactions. This understanding of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of creating abundant N-terminated edges.

The research shows that by using a zinc template method, they were able to create P-BN with a high surface area and abundant N-terminated edges, resulting in improved catalytic performance. This approach demonstrates how understanding the unique properties of edge sites can be applied to design more effective catalysts.

While the study doesn't specifically address ODHP reactions, the principles of tailoring edge sites and understanding their role in oxygen activation could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for ODHP and other oxidation reactions in commercial applications.

文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的影响。然而，它确实提供了关于边缘活性位点，特别是N端边缘在氮化硼催化剂中对于有氧氧化反应的重要性的见解。

该研究重点关注了调整多孔氮化硼(P-BN)的N端缺陷边缘以增强有氧催化。它证明了N端边缘位点是氧气活化的活性位点，这对氧化反应至关重要。这种对一维边缘活性位点的理解通过强调创造丰富的N端边缘的重要性，为设计更高效的催化剂做出了贡献。

研究表明，通过使用锌模板方法，他们能够创造出具有高比表面积和丰富N端边缘的P-BN，从而提高了催化性能。这种方法展示了如何将对边缘位点独特性质的理解应用于设计更有效的催化剂。

虽然该研究没有具体针对ODHP反应，但调整边缘位点和理解它们在氧气活化中的作用的原理可能潜在地应用于设计更高效的ODHP和其他商业应用中的氧化反应催化剂。
