[1] "Hermans and co-workers.[3] They found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "To attain this goal, two strategies can be adopted: generating abundant active sites and making them more accessible. For generating abundant active sites, an agent-assisted synthesis is an efficient strategy to achieve this target,5 but such a strategy has not been reported in the field of h-BN catalysts."

[4] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected7 and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed.8"

[5] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature suggests that defective edges in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are catalytically active sites, similar to those found in graphene and other carbon-based catalysts. These edge sites are primarily 1-D in nature.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Increased abundance of active sites: By using agent-assisted synthesis strategies, it is possible to generate a higher number of active edge sites, potentially improving catalytic performance.

2. Enhanced accessibility: Creating porous structures in the catalyst material increases the specific surface area, exposing more active sites and making them more accessible to reactants.

3. Tailored edge termination: The study demonstrates that artificially constructed N-terminated edges can be created, which may have different catalytic properties compared to B-terminated or mixed edges.

4. Improved understanding of structure-activity relationships: By studying the performance of catalysts with different types of edge sites (e.g., N-terminated vs. B-terminated), researchers can gain insights into which structural features are most important for catalytic activity.

5. Optimization of catalyst design: With knowledge of the importance of edge sites and their accessibility, catalysts can be designed to maximize the number and exposure of these active sites, potentially leading to improved performance in commercial applications.

The research presented in this literature provides a foundation for developing more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions by focusing on the creation and optimization of 1-D edge active sites through careful control of spatial distribution and dimensionality.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，六方氮化硼（h-BN）中的缺陷边缘是催化活性位点，类似于石墨烯和其他碳基催化剂中的活性位点。这些边缘位点主要是一维的。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 增加活性位点数量：通过使用助剂辅助合成策略，可以生成更多的活性边缘位点，从而可能提高催化性能。

2. 提高可及性：在催化剂材料中创建多孔结构可以增加比表面积，暴露更多活性位点，使反应物更容易接触到这些位点。

3. 定制边缘终止：研究表明可以人工构建N端接边缘，这可能具有不同于B端接或混合边缘的催化性能。

4. 改进结构-活性关系的理解：通过研究具有不同类型边缘位点（如N端接与B端接）的催化剂性能，研究人员可以深入了解哪些结构特征对催化活性最为重要。

5. 优化催化剂设计：了解边缘位点及其可及性的重要性后，可以设计催化剂以最大化这些活性位点的数量和暴露程度，从而可能在商业应用中提高性能。

本文献中的研究为开发更高效的ODHP反应B基催化剂奠定了基础，重点是通过仔细控制空间分布和维度来创建和优化一维边缘活性位点。
