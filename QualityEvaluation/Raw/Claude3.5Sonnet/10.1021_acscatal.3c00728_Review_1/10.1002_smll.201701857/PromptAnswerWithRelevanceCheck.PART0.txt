[1] "Hermans and co-workers found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that the armchair structure was the catalytic active sites by theoretical calculation but not experimentally proved."

[4] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed."

[5] "To analyze the atomic arrangement and N-terminated porous structures of P-BN-6, zoom-in atomic-resolution STEM MAADF was performed (Figure 2c), providing evidence of a honeycomb texture."

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the nature of active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts and their influence on catalytic performance in general.

The study focuses on the importance of defective edges in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as catalytically active sites. It suggests that the 1-D edge sites, particularly N-terminated edges, play a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity. The researchers found that creating abundant N-terminated defective edges and making them more accessible through a porous structure led to improved catalytic performance.

The dimensionality of active sites is indirectly addressed through the discussion of porous structures. By creating a porous BN material with a high specific surface area, more active sites are exposed, including those in pristine regions. This suggests that increasing the accessibility of active sites through 3-D porous structures can enhance catalytic performance.

The study also highlights the importance of understanding the unique properties of different types of edge sites (B-terminated, N-terminated, and armchair) in BN catalysts. Through DFT calculations and experimental validation, the researchers found that N-terminated edges were particularly effective for oxygen activation, which is crucial for oxidation reactions.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on ODHP reactions, it demonstrates that tailoring the edge structure and creating porous materials can significantly improve catalytic performance in aerobic oxidation reactions. This understanding could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, including ODHP, by focusing on optimizing the distribution and accessibility of active edge sites in B-based catalysts.

这篇文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氮化硼（BN）催化剂中活性位点的性质及其对催化性能影响的见解。

研究重点关注了六方氮化硼（h-BN）中缺陷边缘作为催化活性位点的重要性。它表明，1-D边缘位点，特别是N端边缘，在提高催化活性中起着关键作用。研究人员发现，创造大量N端缺陷边缘并通过多孔结构使其更容易接触，可以提高催化性能。

活性位点的维度通过对多孔结构的讨论间接得到了解决。通过创建具有高比表面积的多孔BN材料，更多的活性位点被暴露出来，包括那些在原始区域的位点。这表明，通过3-D多孔结构增加活性位点的可接触性可以提高催化性能。

研究还强调了理解BN催化剂中不同类型边缘位点（B端、N端和扶手结构）的独特性质的重要性。通过DFT计算和实验验证，研究人员发现N端边缘对氧气活化特别有效，这对氧化反应至关重要。

虽然这项研究并未特别关注ODHP反应，但它表明，调整边缘结构和创建多孔材料可以显著提高有氧氧化反应的催化性能。这种理解可能有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，包括ODHP，通过专注于优化B基催化剂中活性边缘位点的分布和可接触性。

The study focuses on tailoring N-terminated defective edges of porous boron nitride for enhanced aerobic catalysis. It suggests that defective edges in h-BN are likely to be catalytically active sites, similar to those in graphene. The researchers developed a strategy to create artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a high specific surface area (SSA) of up to 1579 m2/g.

The N-terminated edges were found to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation reactions. This was confirmed through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration experiments. The creation of numerous pores in the BN structure allowed for a high SSA, which exposed more active sites in the pristine regions.

While the study doesn't specifically address ODHP reactions, it demonstrates that tailoring the edge structure and increasing the surface area of BN catalysts can significantly enhance their catalytic performance in aerobic oxidation reactions. This understanding of the relationship between edge structure, surface area, and catalytic activity could potentially be applied to the design of more efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions.

The research highlights the importance of 1-D edge active sites in BN catalysts, particularly N-terminated edges. By focusing on these specific sites and developing methods to increase their abundance and accessibility, it may be possible to design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, including ODHP reactions.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature suggests that defective edges in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are catalytically active sites, similar to those found in graphene and other carbon-based catalysts. These edge sites are primarily 1-D in nature.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Increased abundance of active sites: By using agent-assisted synthesis strategies, it is possible to generate a higher number of active edge sites, potentially improving catalytic performance.

2. Enhanced accessibility: Creating porous structures in the catalyst material increases the specific surface area, exposing more active sites and making them more accessible to reactants.

3. Tailored edge termination: The study demonstrates that artificially constructed N-terminated edges can be created, which may have different catalytic properties compared to B-terminated or mixed edges.

4. Improved understanding of structure-activity relationships: By studying the performance of catalysts with different types of edge sites (e.g., N-terminated vs. B-terminated), researchers can gain insights into which structural features are most important for catalytic activity.

5. Optimization of catalyst design: With knowledge of the importance of edge sites and their accessibility, catalysts can be designed to maximize the number and exposure of these active sites, potentially leading to improved performance in commercial applications.

The research presented in this literature provides a foundation for developing more efficient B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions by focusing on the creation and optimization of 1-D edge active sites through careful control of spatial distribution and dimensionality.
