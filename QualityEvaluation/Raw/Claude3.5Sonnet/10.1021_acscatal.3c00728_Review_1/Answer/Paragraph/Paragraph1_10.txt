The spatial distribution, classification, and performance of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Of particular interest are the 1-D edge active sites, which have shown promising catalytic activity and selectivity. These linear structures along the edges of boron-containing materials offer unique geometric and electronic properties that enhance the ODHP reaction. Understanding the nature of these active sites is essential for optimizing catalyst design and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed that the precise arrangement of boron atoms at these edges can significantly influence catalyst performance, with certain configurations promoting higher propylene yields. This knowledge has led to the development of novel synthesis strategies aimed at maximizing the exposure of these 1-D edge sites. Furthermore, the classification of different types of active sites within B-based catalysts has provided valuable insights into structure-activity relationships, enabling researchers to tailor catalyst compositions for improved efficiency. As a result, the focus on 1-D edge active sites has opened new avenues for rational catalyst design and has contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between catalyst structure and ODHP reaction pathways.
