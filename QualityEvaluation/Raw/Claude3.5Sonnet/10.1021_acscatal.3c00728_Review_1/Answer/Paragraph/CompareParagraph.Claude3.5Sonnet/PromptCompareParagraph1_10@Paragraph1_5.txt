The spatial distribution, classification, and performance of active sites in B-based catalysts play a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Of particular interest are the 1-D edge active sites, which have shown promising catalytic activity and selectivity. These linear structures along the edges of boron-containing materials offer unique geometric and electronic properties that enhance the ODHP reaction. Understanding the nature of these active sites is essential for optimizing catalyst design and elucidating reaction mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed that the precise arrangement of boron atoms at these edges can significantly influence catalyst performance, with certain configurations promoting higher propylene yields. This knowledge has led to the development of novel synthesis strategies aimed at maximizing the exposure of these 1-D edge sites. Furthermore, the classification of different types of active sites within B-based catalysts has provided valuable insights into structure-activity relationships, enabling researchers to tailor catalyst compositions for improved efficiency. As a result, the focus on 1-D edge active sites has opened new avenues for rational catalyst design and has contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between catalyst structure and ODHP reaction pathways.

<file-attachment-contents filename="Review B.txt"> 
The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Based on the comprehensive review of various studies, the active sites in B-based catalysts can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1].

1-D Edge Active Sites:
The 1-D edge active sites, particularly in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) materials, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. These sites are linearly dispersed on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1]. The edge sites, often hydroxylated (BOH groups), play a crucial role in the catalytic process [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62786-4]. The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to high selectivity and efficiency in ODHP reactions [10.1002/cctc.201700004].

Reaction Mechanism:
The reaction mechanism on 1-D edge sites involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, generating BO and HO2 radicals. These radicals then facilitate hydrogen abstraction from propane, leading to propylene formation [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028]. DFT calculations have revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by O-O bond cleavage to create B-O and N-O species [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1].

Performance and Selectivity:
h-BN catalysts with 1-D edge active sites have demonstrated remarkable performance, with propene selectivity as high as 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1]. Some studies have reported even higher selectivity, with edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) achieving propylene selectivity of 80.2% with minimal CO2 formation (0.5%) at a propane conversion of 20.6% [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

2-D and 3-D Active Sites:
While 1-D edge sites show promising results, 2-D and 3-D active site distributions also play important roles in catalyst performance. For instance, B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts with 2-D surface-distributed sites demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040]. 3-D structures, such as honeycomb cordierite with straight channels, allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

Challenges and Optimization:
Despite the excellent selectivity of 1-D edge active sites, some challenges exist, including the presence of an induction period, low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials, and stability issues [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1]. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed strategies such as preoxygen modification of edge sites, increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets, and creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_1].

Future Directions:
Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Future research should focus on optimizing the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, maximizing edge exposure, and improving catalyst stability and durability.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
The comprehensive review of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions reveals the critical role of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in determining catalyst performance. While 1-D edge active sites, particularly in h-BN materials, have shown promising results, the interplay between 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D active site distributions offers opportunities for further optimization.

Future research directions may include:

1. Hybrid catalyst designs: Developing catalysts that combine the advantages of 1-D edge sites with 2-D and 3-D structures to optimize both selectivity and mass transfer properties.

2. In-situ characterization techniques: Advancing methods to study the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions, particularly the transformation of edge sites during ODHP reactions.

3. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced computational techniques to predict and design optimal spatial distributions of active sites for specific ODHP applications.

4. Scalable synthesis methods: Developing industrially viable processes for creating catalysts with controlled dimensionality and high density of active edge sites.

5. Stability enhancement: Investigating novel approaches to improve the long-term stability of edge active sites without compromising their high selectivity and activity.

6. Structure-performance relationships: Conducting systematic studies to establish clear correlations between the spatial distribution of active sites and catalyst performance metrics.

7. Alternative B-based materials: Exploring new boron-containing compounds or composites that could offer unique active site distributions and enhanced catalytic properties.

By pursuing these research directions, the field of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions could potentially achieve significant breakthroughs, leading to more efficient, selective, and commercially viable processes for propylene production.
