The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites, each with unique properties and contributions to catalytic performance [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

1-D Active Sites:
1-D active sites, typically found on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. These edge sites, particularly when hydroxylated (BOH groups), play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism [10.1002/cctc.201700004]. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites include:
1. Stabilization of propyl radicals, preventing overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
2. Efficient activation of O2, creating dynamic active sites for propane dehydrogenation [10.1002/cctc.201700004].
3. Higher π* to σ* ratio and B/N ratio compared to in-plane structures [10.1002/cctc.201700004].

2-D Active Sites:
2-D active sites are typically found on the surface of layered boron-containing materials. These sites offer advantages such as:
1. Improved accessibility to reactants due to their surface exposure [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021].
2. Ability to form specific active structures like boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017].
3. Potential for high dispersion of active species across the catalyst surface [10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3].

3-D Active Sites:
3-D active sites are found in bulk materials or complex structures. They offer unique advantages:
1. Improved thermal stability and resistance to sintering [10.1002/anie.200901826].
2. Potential for creating hierarchical porous structures that enhance mass transfer [10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156743].
3. Ability to form B-O-B connectivity, which has been shown to be important for catalytic activity [10.1002/anie.201914696].

The dimensionality of active sites significantly impacts catalyst performance:
1. 1-D edge sites offer high selectivity and efficiency but may suffer from low density and stability issues [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].
2. 2-D surface sites provide good accessibility but may be prone to overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
3. 3-D structures can offer improved stability and mass transfer but may have limited accessibility to active sites [10.1002/anie.200901826].

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:
1. Optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites to maximize performance [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].
2. Developing synthesis methods that create targeted active site structures [10.1002/smll.201701857].
3. Balancing the trade-offs between different dimensionalities to achieve desired catalytic properties [10.1002/cctc.201701140].
4. Exploring novel catalyst designs that combine the advantages of different dimensionalities, such as 1-D nanofibers or 3-D hierarchical structures [10.1002/cctc.202100476] [10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156743].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions is rapidly evolving, with significant potential for further improvements. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing advanced synthesis techniques to precisely control the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, potentially combining the advantages of different dimensionalities in a single catalyst.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

1-D Edge Active Sites:
1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with only 0.5% CO2 at a propane conversion of 20.6% [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

Reaction Mechanism:
DFT calculations revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by O-O bond cleavage to create B-O and N-O species [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. The edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of alkanes to produce alkyl radicals, while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation in the gas phase [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].

Site Activity:
The zig-B edge was found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, with propane dehydrogenation occurring more easily on oxygen-modified edge sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. N-terminated edges are particularly effective for oxygen activation, crucial for oxidation reactions [10.1002/smll.201701857].

2-D and 3-D Active Sites:
While 1-D edge sites show promising results, other spatial distributions also play important roles. B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface, indicating the importance of well-distributed 2-D active sites [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040]. The use of honeycomb cordierite structures with straight channels allows for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer, suggesting the importance of 3-D structural design in catalyst performance [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

Performance Improvement Strategies:
Understanding the importance of edge sites has led to strategies for improving catalyst performance, such as:
a) Preoxygen modification of edge sites to reduce the induction period and improve ODHP performance.
b) Increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio.
c) Creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

Challenges and Future Directions:
Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. These include the existence of an induction period, low density of edge active sites, and stability issues [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. Researchers are working to overcome these challenges and develop more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The study of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions has revealed the critical role of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in determining catalytic performance. While 1-D edge active sites have shown promising results, the interplay between 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D structures offers opportunities for further optimization.

Future research directions may include:
1. Developing hybrid catalysts that combine the advantages of different spatial distributions, such as 1-D edge sites with 3-D porous structures for improved mass transfer.
2. Exploring novel synthesis methods to create tailored active site distributions, potentially using advanced techniques like atomic layer deposition or 3D printing.
3. Investigating the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions to better understand and control catalyst stability and regeneration.
4. Applying machine learning algorithms to predict optimal spatial distributions and compositions for specific reaction conditions.
5. Exploring the potential of doping or creating heterostructures to further enhance the performance of B-based catalysts.

By integrating these approaches, researchers may develop next-generation catalysts that offer unprecedented selectivity, activity, and stability for ODHP reactions, potentially revolutionizing propylene production in the chemical industry.

3. Enhanced porosity: 3-D structures often feature hierarchical porosity, improving mass transfer and accessibility of active sites [10.1016/j.apsusc.2023.156743].

The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the nature and distribution of their active sites. For instance, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Optimizing edge exposure: Maximizing the number of accessible edge sites can enhance catalytic performance [10.1002/smll.201701857].
2. Tailoring surface chemistry: Modifying edge termination and functionalization can optimize catalytic properties [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62786-4].
3. Controlling active site density: Balancing the concentration of active sites with stability and accessibility is crucial for long-term performance [10.1002/anie.201914696].
4. Enhancing mass transfer: Designing catalyst structures that facilitate efficient movement of reactants and products can improve overall performance [10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63809-3].

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites include:
1. Stabilization of propyl radicals, preventing overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
2. Selective activation of C-H bonds in propane [10.1002/cctc.201700004].
3. Efficient oxygen activation at edge B atoms [10.1002/cctc.201700725].

2-D Active Sites:
2-D active sites are typically found on the surface of h-BN sheets or other layered boron-containing materials. These sites can include defects, such as three-boron center (TBC) N-defects, which play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion [10.1002/anie.202106713]. B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

3-D Active Sites:
3-D active sites are often found in bulk boron-containing materials or as aggregated boron species. For example, B2O3 clusters formed on carbon nanofiber surfaces at higher calcination temperatures create a 3-D distribution of active sites [10.1002/cssc.201402363]. The aggregated boron species embedded in MWW- and MFI-type zeolites displayed high efficiency in activating propane [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.11.031].

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites influence catalyst performance through several mechanisms:

1. Accessibility: 1-D edge sites and 2-D surface sites often provide better accessibility to reactants compared to 3-D bulk sites [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].
2. Selectivity: The 1-D nature of edge sites helps avoid the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals, leading to higher olefin selectivity [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
3. Stability: 3-D structures and aggregated species can provide better thermal stability and resistance to sintering [10.1002/anie.200901826].

2. Developing synthesis methods to create tailored spatial distributions of active sites [10.1002/smll.201701857].
3. Exploring hybrid structures that combine the advantages of different dimensionalities, such as 1-D B2O3 nanowires on 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028].
4. Focusing on creating and maintaining specific active site structures, such as BOH groups or B-O-B connectivity, rather than isolated BO3 units [10.1002/anie.201914696].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The research on B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions has revealed the critical role of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in determining catalyst performance. Moving forward, several promising directions emerge:

1. Multiscale catalyst design: Future research could focus on developing catalysts that integrate advantageous features from different dimensionalities. For example, combining 1-D edge sites for high selectivity with 3-D structures for improved stability and heat management.

2. Dynamic active site engineering: Given the observed dynamic nature of some active sites under reaction conditions, future catalyst designs could incorporate features that promote beneficial restructuring during reactions, potentially leading to self-optimizing catalysts.

3. Advanced characterization techniques: Development of in-situ and operando characterization methods to better understand the evolution of active sites during reactions could provide crucial insights for catalyst optimization.

4. Computational screening and machine learning: Leveraging computational methods to predict optimal spatial distributions and compositions of active sites could accelerate the discovery of high-performance catalysts.

5. Sustainable catalyst production: Exploring environmentally friendly synthesis methods for creating tailored B-based catalysts with optimized active site distributions could enhance the commercial viability of ODHP processes.

These future directions could lead to the development of next-generation B-based catalysts with unprecedented performance in ODHP reactions, potentially revolutionizing propylene production technologies.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites, each with unique properties and influences on catalytic performance [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

1-D Edge Active Sites:
1-D active sites, typically found on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. These edge sites, particularly when hydroxylated or oxygen-terminated, play a crucial role in catalytic activity [10.1002/cctc.201700004]. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites include:
1. Stabilization of propyl radicals, preventing overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
2. Efficient activation of O2 molecules [10.1002/cctc.201700725].
3. Formation of dynamic active sites through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups [10.1002/cctc.201700004].

2-D and 3-D Active Sites:
While 1-D edge sites show promising results, 2-D and 3-D active site distributions also play important roles in catalyst performance. For instance:
1. B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts with 2-D surface-distributed sites showed higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].
2. 3-D structures, such as honeycomb cordierite with straight channels, allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

The spatial distribution of active sites also influences catalyst performance through:
1. Accessibility of active sites to reactants [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021].
2. Thermal conductivity and hotspot prevention [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Based on the comprehensive review of various studies, the active sites in B-based catalysts can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

1-D Edge Active Sites:
The 1-D edge active sites, particularly in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) materials, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. These sites are linearly dispersed on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. The edge sites, often hydroxylated (BOH groups), play a crucial role in the catalytic process [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62786-4]. The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to high selectivity and efficiency in ODHP reactions [10.1002/cctc.201700004].

Reaction Mechanism:
The reaction mechanism on 1-D edge sites involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, generating BO and HO2 radicals. These radicals then facilitate hydrogen abstraction from propane, leading to propylene formation [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028]. DFT calculations have revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by O-O bond cleavage to create B-O and N-O species [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

Performance and Selectivity:
h-BN catalysts with 1-D edge active sites have demonstrated remarkable performance, with propene selectivity as high as 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. Some studies have reported even higher selectivity, with edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) achieving propylene selectivity of 80.2% with minimal CO2 formation (0.5%) at a propane conversion of 20.6% [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

2-D and 3-D Active Sites:
While 1-D edge sites show promising results, 2-D and 3-D active site distributions also play important roles in catalyst performance. For instance, B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts with 2-D surface-distributed sites demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040]. 3-D structures, such as honeycomb cordierite with straight channels, allow for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

Challenges and Optimization:
Despite the excellent selectivity of 1-D edge active sites, some challenges exist, including the presence of an induction period, low density of edge active sites in 2-D materials, and stability issues [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed strategies such as preoxygen modification of edge sites, increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets, and creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

Future Directions:
Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. Future research should focus on optimizing the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, maximizing edge exposure, and improving catalyst stability and durability.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
The comprehensive review of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions reveals the critical role of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in determining catalyst performance. While 1-D edge active sites, particularly in h-BN materials, have shown promising results, the interplay between 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D active site distributions offers opportunities for further optimization.

Future research directions may include:

1. Hybrid catalyst designs: Developing catalysts that combine the advantages of 1-D edge sites with 2-D and 3-D structures to optimize both selectivity and mass transfer properties.

2. In-situ characterization techniques: Advancing methods to study the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions, particularly the transformation of edge sites during ODHP reactions.

3. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced computational techniques to predict and design optimal spatial distributions of active sites for specific ODHP applications.

4. Scalable synthesis methods: Developing industrially viable processes for creating catalysts with controlled dimensionality and high density of active edge sites.

5. Stability enhancement: Investigating novel approaches to improve the long-term stability of edge active sites without compromising their high selectivity and activity.

6. Structure-performance relationships: Conducting systematic studies to establish clear correlations between the spatial distribution of active sites and catalyst performance metrics.

7. Alternative B-based materials: Exploring new boron-containing compounds or composites that could offer unique active site distributions and enhanced catalytic properties.

By pursuing these research directions, the field of B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions could potentially achieve significant breakthroughs, leading to more efficient, selective, and commercially viable processes for propylene production.

The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

1-D Active Sites:
1-D active sites, typically found on the edges of 2-D h-BN sheets or in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions.

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites contribute to their high performance:
1. Stabilization of propyl radicals: Unlike 0D sites (e.g., V/SiO2) that create highly reactive propyl radicals, 1D edge sites in BN catalysts stabilize these radicals, reducing overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
2. Selective oxygen activation: DFT calculations revealed that N-terminated edges have moderate dissociative energy for oxygen atoms, enhancing catalytic activity [10.1002/smll.201701857].
3. Dynamic active site formation: Edge BOH groups can be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and HO2 radicals that facilitate hydrogen abstraction from alkanes [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].

2-D Active Sites:
2-D active sites are typically found on the surface of layered boron-containing materials. For instance, B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040]. Layered borosilicate zeolites with 2-D structures have also shown good performance in ODHP reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021].

3-D Active Sites:
3-D active sites are often found in bulk materials or complex structures. For example, the B2O3@BPO4 catalyst features a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, where 1-D B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres. This arrangement provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites, contributing to excellent performance in ODHP reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028].

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these various active sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Optimizing edge site exposure: Maximizing the number of accessible edge sites can enhance catalytic performance [10.1002/cctc.202100476].
2. Tailoring edge functionalization: Optimizing hydroxylation or other edge modifications can improve catalyst activity and selectivity [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62786-4].
3. Controlling spatial distribution: Creating porous structures or using supports like cordierite can optimize the distribution of active sites and enhance mass transfer [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].
4. Balancing surface and gas-phase reactions: Understanding the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase radical reactions allows for optimizing both pathways [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.11.031].
5. Tuning thermal properties: Leveraging the superior thermal conductivity of materials like h-BN can help avoid hotspots and improve selectivity [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The study of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions has revealed the critical role of 1-D edge sites, particularly in h-BN materials. These findings open up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Developing novel synthesis methods to create catalysts with a higher density of optimized edge sites while maintaining stability.
2. Exploring hybrid materials that combine the advantages of different dimensionalities, such as 1-D edge sites on 3-D supports, to maximize both activity and selectivity.
3. Investigating the potential of in-situ modification of active sites during reactions to maintain optimal performance over extended periods.
4. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling to gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions.
5. Exploring the application of these insights to other related reactions, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes or the direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons.

By building on the current understanding of the relationship between active site distribution, dimensionality, and catalytic performance, researchers can potentially develop a new generation of highly efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and related reactions, bringing us closer to more sustainable and economical processes for olefin production.

The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites include:
1. Stabilization of propyl radicals, avoiding the creation of highly reactive species prone to overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
2. Efficient activation of O2, with edge B atoms playing a crucial role [10.1002/cctc.201700725].
3. Formation of specific active structures like BOH groups, which selectively break C-H bonds while suppressing propylene overoxidation [10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.014].

2-D Active Sites:
2-D active sites are typically found on the surface of materials like B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. These catalysts demonstrate higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040]. The 2-D distribution of active sites can be effective, as shown by layered borosilicate zeolites with surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.03.021].

3-D Active Sites:
3-D active sites are often found in more complex structures, such as the B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure. This arrangement provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites, contributing to excellent performance in ODHP reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028].

The performance of these catalysts is influenced by several factors:
1. Edge vs. Surface Sites: Edge sites, particularly in 1-D configurations, often show higher activity and selectivity compared to surface sites [10.1002/cctc.201700725].
2. Defects and N-termination: Defective trigonal boron species and N-terminated edges play crucial roles in catalytic activity [10.1002/anie.202106713].
3. Connectivity: Active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, rather than isolated BO3 units [10.1002/anie.201914696].
4. Dynamic Nature: Under reaction conditions, the active sites can undergo restructuring, forming a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase [10.1002/anie.201914696].

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:
1. Optimizing edge exposure and density in 1-D and 2-D materials.
2. Tailoring the distribution and connectivity of boron species to enhance activity and selectivity.
3. Developing synthesis methods that create and maintain desired active site structures under reaction conditions.
4. Balancing surface-catalyzed and gas-phase radical reactions for improved overall activity [10.1016/j.jcat.2022.11.031].

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1].

1-D active sites:
1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_1]. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with minimal CO2 formation (0.5%) at a propane conversion of 20.6% [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

The unique properties of 1-D edge active sites contribute to their high performance:
1. Stabilization of intermediates: The 1-D nature of edge sites allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals, avoiding the creation of highly reactive species that lead to overoxidation [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
2. Oxygen activation: Edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, forming BOH and BO active sites that facilitate dehydrogenation without dissociating O2 [10.1002/cctc.201700725].
3. Selective hydrogen abstraction: BO radicals catalyze hydrogen abstraction from alkanes to produce alkyl radicals [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].

2-D active sites:
2-D active sites are typically found on the surface of materials like B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. These catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040]. The 2-D distribution allows for a high density of accessible active sites, contributing to improved catalytic performance.

3-D active sites:
3-D active sites can be found in structures like B2O3@BPO4 composites with sandwich-like hollow sphere structures. At reaction temperatures above 450°C, melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as the catalytically active species [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028]. This 3-D arrangement provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites influence catalyst performance through several mechanisms:
1. Accessibility: 1-D edge sites and porous 3-D structures provide better accessibility to reactants [10.1002/cctc.202100476].
2. Mass transfer: Well-developed channel structures in 3-D catalysts enhance mass transfer and provide space for gas-phase radical reactions [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].
3. Thermal management: The distribution of active sites can affect thermal conductivity, helping to avoid hotspots during reactions [10.1016/j.cattod.2018.12.028].
4. Selectivity control: The spatial arrangement of active sites can influence the formation of intermediates and suppress overoxidation reactions [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:
1. Optimizing edge site exposure and density in 1-D and 2-D catalysts [10.1002/smll.201701857].
2. Developing synthesis methods to create catalysts with tailored spatial distributions of active sites [10.1002/cctc.202100476].
3. Exploring novel 3-D structures that combine the advantages of high surface area and improved mass transfer [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.028].
4. Focusing on the creation and preservation of specific coordination environments (e.g., tricoordinated boron) that are conducive to ODHP reactions [10.1016/j.cjche.2020.07.040].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The research on B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions has revealed the critical role of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in determining catalyst performance. While 1-D edge sites have shown remarkable selectivity and activity, the integration of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D active sites in hierarchical structures could potentially lead to synergistic effects, combining the advantages of each dimensionality.

Future research directions may include:
1. Developing advanced characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions.
2. Exploring the use of computational modeling to predict optimal spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites for specific reaction conditions.
3. Investigating the potential of hybrid catalysts that combine B-based materials with other elements to create multifunctional active sites.
4. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration of active sites in different spatial configurations to improve catalyst longevity for commercial applications.
5. Exploring the application of these insights to other related reactions, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes or the direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons.

By continuing to unravel the complex relationships between active site distribution, reaction mechanisms, and catalyst performance, researchers can pave the way for the next generation of highly efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and related processes, potentially revolutionizing the production of valuable chemical feedstocks.
