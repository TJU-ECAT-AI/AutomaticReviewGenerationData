          [1] "Hermans and co-workers found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed."

[4] "To analyze the atomic arrangement and N-terminated porous structures of P-BN-6, zoom-in atomic-resolution STEM MAADF was performed (Figure 2c), providing evidence of a honeycomb texture."

[5] "DFT calculation indicated that the enhanced catalytic activity mainly originated from the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges."

[6] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained"

[7] "Moreover, the preferential N-terminated edges proved to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds, via both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration."

[8] "Hence, we suggest that the active site for current reaction on P-BN may be the N-terminated zigzags around pores."

[9] "To give direct evidence of the above conclusion, chemical titration was employed. To verify whether the active sites were located at edges, we used a ball-milled g-BN (g-BN-B) as the catalyst, which had more exposed edges than pristine g-BN."

[10] "These results showed that N-terminated edge sites are active sites, which is consistent with the DFT results. With abundant N-terminated edges from the Zn templates, the prepared P-BNs showed quite satisfying catalytic performance."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research focuses on the importance of 1-D edge active sites, especially N-terminated edges, in enhancing catalytic activity.

Key findings include:

1. Defective edges in h-BN function as catalytically active sites, similar to those in graphene.
2. N-terminated edges are particularly effective for oxygen activation, crucial for oxidation reactions.
3. Creating porous structures with high specific surface areas (up to 1579 m2/g) exposes more active sites, enhancing overall catalytic performance.
4. The spatial distribution of active sites is optimized by generating abundant N-terminated edges around pores.
5. The dimensionality of active sites is primarily 1-D, focusing on edge sites rather than planar or 3-D structures.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Increasing the density and accessibility of active sites through porous structures.
2. Tailoring edge termination to optimize catalytic properties.
3. Developing targeted synthesis methods, such as using Zn templates, to create catalysts with optimized active site distributions.
4. Providing insights into structure-activity relationships, allowing for more rational catalyst design.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on ODHP reactions, the principles of tailoring edge sites and understanding their role in oxygen activation could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for ODHP and other oxidation reactions in commercial applications.

          B基催化剂，特别是六方氮化硼（h-BN）中活性位点的空间分布和维度对其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能有显著影响。研究重点关注一维边缘活性位点，特别是N端边缘，在提高催化活性方面的重要性。

主要发现包括：

1. h-BN中的缺陷边缘作为催化活性位点，类似于石墨烯中的活性位点。
2. N端边缘对氧气活化特别有效，这对氧化反应至关重要。
3. 创建具有高比表面积（高达1579 m2/g）的多孔结构，暴露更多活性位点，提高整体催化性能。
4. 通过在孔周围生成丰富的N端边缘来优化活性位点的空间分布。
5. 活性位点的维度主要是一维的，侧重于边缘位点而不是平面或三维结构。

理解这些独特的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，通过：

1. 通过多孔结构增加活性位点的密度和可及性。
2. 定制边缘终端以优化催化性能。
3. 开发有针对性的合成方法，如使用Zn模板，创建具有优化活性位点分布的催化剂。
4. 提供结构-活性关系的见解，允许更合理的催化剂设计。

虽然该研究并未特别关注ODHP反应，但调整边缘位点和理解它们在氧气活化中的作用的原理可能潜在地应用于设计更高效的ODHP和其他商业应用中的氧化反应催化剂。
