          [1] "Boron-based catalysts have received significant attention for their inhibition of deep oxidation of olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process for the production of propylene"

[2] "The aggregated boron species embedded in MWW- and MFI-typed zeolite displayed high efficiency in activating propane"

[3] "Lately, the isolated boron site with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite showed durability in long period test and enabled the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through three hydrogen bonds on the boron site"

[4] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[5] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[6] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Different structures of boron-containing catalysts, such as zeolites, h-BN, and B2O3, offer unique properties that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

Key points about the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality:

1. Aggregated boron species in MWW- and MFI-type zeolites show high efficiency in activating propane.
2. Isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.
3. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.
4. The extra-large micropores in embryonic zeolitic materials improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: Boron-based catalysts inhibit deep oxidation of olefins, leading to higher propylene selectivity.
2. Enhanced durability: Isolated boron sites in zeolites show long-term stability, crucial for commercial applications.
3. Optimized porosity: Extra-large microporosity improves mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.
4. Balanced reaction pathways: Understanding the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase radical reactions allows for optimizing both pathways for improved overall activity.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop B-based catalysts with tailored spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites, leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial use.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。不同结构的含硼催化剂，如沸石、h-BN和B2O3，提供了影响催化活性和选择性的独特性质。

关于空间分布和维度影响的关键点：

1. MWW和MFI型沸石中的聚集硼物种在活化丙烷方面表现出高效率。
2. 硼硅酸盐沸石中具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼位点表现出耐久性，并通过氢键实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。
3. 缺陷三配位硼物种中的氢键BOH基团负责在催化剂表面和气相中活化丙烷。
4. 胚胎沸石材料中的超大微孔提高了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 提高选择性：硼基催化剂抑制烯烃的深度氧化，从而提高丙烯选择性。
2. 增强耐久性：沸石中的孤立硼位点表现出长期稳定性，这对商业应用至关重要。
3. 优化孔隙度：超大微孔结构改善了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。
4. 平衡反应途径：了解表面催化和气相自由基反应之间的相互作用，可以优化这两种途径，从而提高整体活性。

通过利用这些见解，研究人员可以开发具有定制空间分布和维度活性位点的B基催化剂，从而开发出更高效、更具选择性的商用ODHP催化剂。
