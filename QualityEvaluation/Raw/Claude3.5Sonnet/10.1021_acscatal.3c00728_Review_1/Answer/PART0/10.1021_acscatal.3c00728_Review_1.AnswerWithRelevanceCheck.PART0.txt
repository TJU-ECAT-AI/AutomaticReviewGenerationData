          [1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."

[6] "DFT calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the OO bond created the BO and NO species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively."

[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."

[8] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

[9] "To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by O-O bond cleavage to create B-O and N-O species.

2. Site activity: The zig-B edge was found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, with propane dehydrogenation occurring more easily on oxygen-modified edge sites.

3. Performance improvement strategies: Understanding the importance of edge sites has led to strategies for improving catalyst performance, such as:
   a) Preoxygen modification of edge sites to reduce the induction period and improve ODHP performance.
   b) Increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio.
   c) Creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites.

4. Addressing challenges: Researchers are working to overcome drawbacks associated with 1-D active sites, including the induction period, low density of edge active sites, and stability issues.

By understanding these unique properties and mechanisms, researchers can design more efficient B-based catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and increased olefin productivity, making them more suitable for commercial ODHP applications.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。活性位点可以分为三类：一维（1-D）、二维（2-D）和三维（3-D）分散活性位点。

一维活性位点，即线性分布在2-D h-BN片边缘的活性位点，在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。例如，具有1-D边缘活性位点的h-BN在14%的丙烷转化率下表现出79%的丙烯选择性，优于传统的V/SiO2等催化剂。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是1-D边缘活性位点，有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 反应机理：DFT计算表明，反应始于从丙烷的第二个碳原子上抽取氢，随后O-O键断裂形成B-O和N-O物种。

2. 位点活性：锯齿形B边缘比扶手椅形或锯齿形N边缘位点更活跃，且在氧修饰的边缘位点上丙烷脱氢更容易发生。

3. 性能改进策略：理解边缘位点的重要性导致了多种改进催化剂性能的策略，如：
   a) 对边缘位点进行预氧化处理，以减少诱导期并提高ODHP性能。
   b) 通过减小BN纳米片的尺寸并增加边缘/表面比来增加边缘位点的密度。
   c) 创造一维形状的材料以增加活性位点数量。

4. 应对挑战：研究人员正在努力克服与1-D活性位点相关的缺点，包括诱导期、边缘活性位点密度低和稳定性问题。

通过理解这些独特的性质和机理，研究人员可以设计出选择性更高、稳定性更好、烯烃产率更高的B基催化剂，使其更适合商业ODHP应用。
