          [1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[4] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[5] "One of the remaining drawbacks is the low overall activity of carbon catalysts, which can be overcome by fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The boron species are highly dispersed throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, creating a complex distribution of active sites:

1. 1-D distribution: The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, creating 1-D edge active sites along the CNT length.

2. 2-D distribution: A minor fraction covers the outer CNT surface as a thin amorphous coating of about 1-2 nm thickness.

3. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer: BOx species are omnipresent, potentially creating 0-D or isolated active sites.

The unique properties of these active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, contribute to enhanced catalytic performance:

1. Improved thermal stability due to covalent bonding to the CNT structure.
2. B2O3 filling acts as a backbone against oxidation.
3. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter inhibits dissociative adsorption of O2, maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
4. Suppressed total combustion reactions and lower reoxidation capacity of active sites lead to enhanced propene selectivity.

Understanding these properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Optimizing the distribution and concentration of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.
2. Improving thermal stability and resistance to oxidation for longer-lasting catalysts.
3. Leveraging the highly dispersed nature of boron species to potentially reduce material costs.
4. Using the unique 1-D structure of CNTs with B-doping as a model system for studying reaction mechanisms.
5. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst through controlled B-doping for improved selectivity and efficiency.

To overcome the drawback of low overall activity in carbon catalysts, future research should focus on fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface while maintaining the advantages of boron modification.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。硼物种高度分散在碳纳米管(CNT)基质中，形成复杂的活性位点分布：

1. 一维分布：大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的腔体和尖端上，形成沿CNT长度的一维边缘活性位点。

2. 二维分布：少量B2O3覆盖在CNT外表面形成厚度约1-2 nm的薄无定形涂层。

3. 高度分散的亚单层：BOx物种无处不在，可能形成零维或孤立的活性位点。

这些活性位点的独特性质，特别是一维边缘位点，有助于提高催化性能：

1. 由于与CNT结构的共价键合，提高了热稳定性。
2. B2O3填充物作为抗氧化的骨架。
3. 作为电子缺乏的促进剂，氧化硼抑制O2的解离吸附，维持催化剂表面的选择性氧物种。
4. 抑制总燃烧反应并降低活性位点的再氧化能力，提高丙烯选择性。

理解这些性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂：

1. 优化活性位点的分布和浓度，以最大化催化性能。
2. 提高热稳定性和抗氧化性，延长催化剂寿命。
3. 利用硼物种的高度分散性，可能降低材料成本。
4. 将B掺杂的CNT独特一维结构用作研究反应机理的模型系统。
5. 通过控制B掺杂调节催化剂的电子性质，提高选择性和效率。

为克服碳催化剂总体活性低的缺点，未来研究应集中在表面制造高浓度的选择性位点，同时保持硼修饰的优势。
