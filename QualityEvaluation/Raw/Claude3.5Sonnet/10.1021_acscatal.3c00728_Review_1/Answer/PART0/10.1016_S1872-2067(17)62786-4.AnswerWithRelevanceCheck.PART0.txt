          [1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

[2] "Independently, our group demonstrated that hydroxlated boron nitride can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with long reaction stability ad extremely low CO2 formation"

[3] "Structure evolution of the BNOH catalysts before and after ODH of ethane was characterized. XRD pattern (Fig. 2(a)) showed that the BNOH catalyst still retained the typical hexagonal layered structure after a 200-h reaction."

[4] "Based on catalytic, spectroscopic and kinetic data, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to understand the underlying possible reaction pathway."

[5] "Based on the experimental studies, the hydroxylated boron nitride was considered as the resting state of the catalyst. In the presence of O2 at high temperature, the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, leading to the generation of two radical species, BNO* and HO2* radicals"

          The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it provides insights into the behavior of hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

The study focuses on BNOH catalysts, which contain hydroxyl groups at the edges. These edge BOH groups play a crucial role in the catalytic process, indicating a 1-D distribution of active sites. The BNOH catalyst retains a hexagonal layered structure, suggesting a 2-D configuration with 1-D edge active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, generating BNO* and HO2* radicals. These radicals then participate in the activation of ethane or propane and their subsequent conversion to ethylene or propylene. This understanding of the reaction pathway at the edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of edge functionalization and the role of hydroxyl groups.

The high selectivity, stability, and low CO2 formation observed in this catalyst system suggest that understanding and optimizing the 1-D edge active sites could lead to improved catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. To design more efficient catalysts, researchers could focus on:

1. Maximizing the number of edge sites in boron nitride-based materials
2. Optimizing the hydroxylation process to increase the density of active BOH groups
3. Exploring other edge functionalization strategies that might enhance catalytic performance
4. Investigating the stability and regeneration of edge active sites under reaction conditions

These approaches, based on the understanding of 1-D edge active sites in 2-D materials, could contribute to the development of more effective and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions and related oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

          该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。然而，它提供了关于羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)催化剂在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢中行为的见解。

研究主要关注BNOH催化剂，其边缘含有羟基基团。这些边缘BOH基团在催化过程中起着关键作用，表明活性位点呈1D分布。BNOH催化剂保持六方层状结构，表明其为2D构型，具有1D边缘活性位点。

反应机理涉及边缘BOH基团被O2脱氢，生成BNO*和HO2*自由基。这些自由基随后参与乙烷或丙烷的活化及其向乙烯或丙烯的转化。对边缘位点反应途径的理解有助于设计更高效的催化剂，突出了边缘功能化和羟基作用的重要性。

该催化剂体系观察到的高选择性、稳定性和低CO2生成表明，理解和优化1D边缘活性位点可能导致改进的商业ODHP应用催化剂。为了设计更高效的催化剂，研究人员可以关注：

1. 最大化氮化硼基材料中的边缘位点数量
2. 优化羟基化过程以增加活性BOH基团的密度
3. 探索可能增强催化性能的其他边缘功能化策略
4. 研究反应条件下边缘活性位点的稳定性和再生

这些基于对2D材料中1D边缘活性位点理解的方法，可能有助于开发更有效和选择性的ODHP反应和相关氧化脱氢过程的催化剂。
