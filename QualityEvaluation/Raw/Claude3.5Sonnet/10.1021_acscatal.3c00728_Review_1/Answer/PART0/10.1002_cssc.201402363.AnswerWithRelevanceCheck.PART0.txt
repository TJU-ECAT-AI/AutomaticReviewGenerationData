          "CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

"The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

"A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

"The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface"

"As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface, which contributes to their catalytic effectiveness.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon surfaces are primarily quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these sites and their distribution.

The dimensionality of active sites varies with calcination temperature:

1-D sites: At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron predominantly forms B-O-C structures, with boron linked to three oxygen atoms or forming (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. These 1-D structures along the edges of the CNFs contribute to selective dehydrogenation.

3-D sites: As calcination temperature increases (973K and above), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface, creating a more 3-D distribution of active sites. New B species continue to develop at even higher temperatures.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading, it's possible to optimize the distribution of active sites, maximizing selectivity towards propene while maintaining high conversion rates. This knowledge allows for the development of catalysts with improved performance and stability, potentially bringing ODHP processes closer to commercial viability.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。碳纳米纤维(CNFs)暴露出基底平面边缘，在外表面提供了高密度的可接触缺陷位点，这有助于其催化效果。

ODHP反应在碳表面的活性位点主要是醌或双羰基基团，而羧酸基团则不具选择性并促进完全氧化。引入硼修饰了这些位点及其分布。

活性位点的维度随煅烧温度而变化：

一维位点：在较低温度(673-773K)下，硼主要形成B-O-C结构，硼与三个氧原子相连或形成与石墨晶格锯齿面相连的(BO3)n链。这些沿CNFs边缘的一维结构有助于选择性脱氢。

三维位点：随着煅烧温度升高(973K及以上)，B2O3簇在CNF表面形成，创造了更多三维分布的活性位点。在更高温度下，新的B物种继续发展。

理解这些独特的一维边缘活性位点的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂。通过控制煅烧温度和硼负载量，可以优化活性位点的分布，在保持高转化率的同时最大化丙烯选择性。这些知识允许开发性能和稳定性更好的催化剂，有可能使ODHP过程更接近商业可行性。
