          [1] "Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

[2] "Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C)."

[3] "In this work, a metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts"

[4] "At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene"

[5] "Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The B2O3@BPO4 catalyst features a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, where 1-D B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres. This structure maximizes the utilization of both sides of the support, which is uncommon in hollow-sphere structures.

At reaction temperatures above 450°C, melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as the catalytically active species. This arrangement provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites, contributing to the catalyst's excellent performance in ODHP reactions.

The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity, selectivity, and stability in ODHP reactions at 550°C, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1, surpassing many metal-based catalysts. This high performance can be attributed to the unique spatial distribution and dimensionality of the active sites, particularly the 1-D B2O3 nanowires covering the 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The sandwich-like structure and the use of melted B2O3 as an active species demonstrate a novel approach to catalyst design, combining the advantages of supported liquid-phase catalysts with the benefits of hollow sphere supports.

While the provided information doesn't explicitly discuss the reaction mechanisms of these sites, the high performance of this catalyst structure implies that the 1-D B2O3 nanowires may provide advantageous active sites for ODHP reactions. This insight could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by suggesting that incorporating 1-D structures or edge active sites in B-based catalysts might be beneficial for ODHP reactions.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度显著影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。B2O3@BPO4催化剂具有独特的三明治状空心球结构，其中1D B2O3纳米线覆盖在3D BPO4空心球的内外表面。这种结构最大限度地利用了支撑体的两侧，这在空心球结构中并不常见。

在450°C以上的反应温度下，支撑在BPO4空心球表面的熔融B2O3作为催化活性物种。这种排列提供了大的表面积和较高的活性位点可及性，有助于催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。

B2O3@BPO4复合物在550°C下的ODHP反应中表现出优异的活性、选择性和稳定性，生产力高达0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1，超过了许多金属基催化剂。这种高性能可归因于活性位点的独特空间分布和维度，特别是覆盖3D BPO4空心球的1D B2O3纳米线。

理解这些1D边缘活性位点的性质和反应机理对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。三明治状结构和使用熔融B2O3作为活性物种展示了催化剂设计的新方法，结合了支撑液相催化剂的优点和空心球支撑体的优势。

虽然提供的信息没有明确讨论这些位点的反应机理，但这种催化剂结构的高性能暗示1D B2O3纳米线可能为ODHP反应提供了有利的活性位点。这一见解可能有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，暗示在B基催化剂中纳入1D结构或边缘活性位点可能对ODHP反应有益。
