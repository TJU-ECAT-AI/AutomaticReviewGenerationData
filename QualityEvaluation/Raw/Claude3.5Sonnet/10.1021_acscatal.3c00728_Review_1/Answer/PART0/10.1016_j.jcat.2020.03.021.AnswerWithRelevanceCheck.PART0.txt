          "Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH."

"Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

"Fig. 1 ac showed the SEM images of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 catalysts, and the BZEO zeolites were composed of intergrown, randomly-oriented, flaky crystals with particles of about 12 μm in length and around 100 nm in thickness."

"TEM image further revealed that the lamellar zeolite consisted of rectilinear sheets with a clear crystallized structure"

          The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides some relevant information:

1. The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites, which are 2D structures. These catalysts showed good performance in ODHP reactions, suggesting that 2D distributions of active sites can be effective.

2. The active sites were identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) on the surface of the catalyst. This indicates that surface-accessible active sites are important for ODHP reactions.

3. The catalyst particles were described as flaky crystals with specific dimensions (about 1-2 μm in length and 100 nm in thickness), implying that the spatial arrangement of active sites may play a role in catalyst performance.

4. The 2D lamellar structure likely provides good accessibility to active sites, which could contribute to the catalyst's effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

While the study does not explicitly compare 1D, 2D, and 3D distributions of active sites or discuss 1D edge active sites, it demonstrates that understanding the nature and location of active sites (in this case, surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species) is crucial for designing efficient ODHP catalysts.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, this research indicates that focusing on creating and optimizing surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species in layered structures could be a promising approach. Further studies comparing different spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites would be beneficial for advancing catalyst design for ODHP reactions.

          该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. 研究重点关注层状硼硅分子筛，这是2D结构。这些催化剂在ODHP反应中表现良好，表明活性位点的2D分布可能是有效的。

2. 活性位点被确定为催化剂表面的缺陷三配位硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b）。这表明表面可接触的活性位点对ODHP反应很重要。

3. 催化剂颗粒被描述为具有特定尺寸的片状晶体（长约1-2微米，厚约100纳米），这意味着活性位点的空间排列可能在催化剂性能中起作用。

4. 2D层状结构可能为活性位点提供良好的可及性，这可能有助于催化剂在ODHP反应中的有效性。

虽然该研究没有明确比较活性位点的1D、2D和3D分布，或讨论1D边缘活性位点，但它表明了解活性位点的性质和位置（在本例中为表面可接触的缺陷三配位硼物种）对设计高效ODHP催化剂至关重要。

为了设计更高效的商业应用催化剂，这项研究表明，专注于在层状结构中创建和优化表面可接触的缺陷三配位硼物种可能是一种有前景的方法。进一步比较活性位点的不同空间分布和维度的研究将有利于推进ODHP反应的催化剂设计。
