[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."

[6] "DFT calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the OO bond created the BO and NO species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively."

[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."

[8] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

[9] "To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed."

[1] "The oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of the h-BN and other bulky and supported boron-containing catalysts are the origin for catalyzing ODH reactions"

[2] "Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties"

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen"

[6] "The isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane"

[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

"Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH."

"Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

"Fig. 1 ac showed the SEM images of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 catalysts, and the BZEO zeolites were composed of intergrown, randomly-oriented, flaky crystals with particles of about 12 Î¼m in length and around 100 nm in thickness."

"TEM image further revealed that the lamellar zeolite consisted of rectilinear sheets with a clear crystallized structure"

[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[3] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

"CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

"The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

"A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

"The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface"

"As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with a little CO2 (0.5%) at propane conversion of 20.6%."

[3] "On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[4] "It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP."

[5] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, s-BN manifested a remarkable 100% selectivity without any trace of byproducts at an ethane conversion of 9.2%."

[3] "Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

[4] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[5] "Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[6] "Notably, the appearance of CO ( =1067cm1) and BO ( =1220cm1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X ."

[7] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "Huang et al. reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "Grant et al. found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts."

[6] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[1] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[2] "TEM images viewed along the [001] direction (Figure2a and FigureS6) revealed that the most frequently exposed lateral termination facets were {10 0}, {01 0}, and {1 00}, suggesting that the terminated configuration had zigzag edges."

[3] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "Hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generates the active sites, which triggers propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "We have demonstrated that boron nitride, upon steam activation to generate BOH groups at the edges, efficiently catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with a superior selectivity toward propylene and a significantly minimized CO2 emission."

[6] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher Ï* to Ï* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge,9 and the B/N ratio (1.28, point2) at the edge was higher than that (0.95, point4) of the in-plane (Figure2b)."

[7] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Figure2d, inset)."

[8] "Upon exposure to C3H8 atmosphere at 530C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged, and no propane conversion was detected (Figure3a). With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened (Figure3a), accompanied with the formation of propylene, indicating that the OH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction network."

[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

          [2] "Based on the above considerations, in this work, a new h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was prepared by the electrospinning method, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene."

          [3] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction"

          [4] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

          [5] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

          [6] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts"

          [7] "In the previous work, based on various means of spectroscopy studies, we proposed the BOH at the edges and defects of h-BN as the active sites in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by means of experimental and theoretical methods, which was subsequently confirmed by other groups."

          [8] "In recent years, the superior activity of h-BN in ODHP was demonstrated, which inspired a wave for the research of boron-based ODHP catalysts. Meanwhile, the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in ODHP have been extensively studied."

[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[4] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[5] "One of the remaining drawbacks is the low overall activity of carbon catalysts, which can be overcome by fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface."

[1] "Boron-based catalysts have received significant attention for their inhibition of deep oxidation of olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process for the production of propylene"

[2] "The aggregated boron species embedded in MWW- and MFI-typed zeolite displayed high efficiency in activating propane"

[3] "Lately, the isolated boron site with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite showed durability in long period test and enabled the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through three hydrogen bonds on the boron site"

[4] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[5] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[6] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[3] "The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes."

[4] "Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes."

[5] "The open one-dimensional fiber structure allows easy diffusion and ensures high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the ODH of alkanes."

[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

[5] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[6] "Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17% prior to the catalytic tests. Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."

[1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "This is drastically different from a 0D site (e.g., V/SiO2), which most likely creates a reactive propyl radical (34), or a 2D site [e.g., Cu(111) surface] where diffusion of adsorbates is unrestricted (35), both prone to overoxidation."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[5] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1) (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."

[1] "Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

[2] "Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C)."

[3] "In this work, a metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts"

[4] "At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene"

[5] "Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

[1] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."

[2] "Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06)."

[3] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

[4] "Taken together these observations suggest that some boron spins are distant from protons, likely due to the formation of some boron oxide clusters in B/B-MWW."

[5] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."

[1] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[2] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[3] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

[4] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[5] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[6] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."

[1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

[2] "Independently, our group demonstrated that hydroxlated boron nitride can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with long reaction stability ad extremely low CO2 formation"

[3] "Structure evolution of the BNOH catalysts before and after ODH of ethane was characterized. XRD pattern (Fig. 2(a)) showed that the BNOH catalyst still retained the typical hexagonal layered structure after a 200-h reaction."

[4] "Based on catalytic, spectroscopic and kinetic data, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to understand the underlying possible reaction pathway."

[5] "Based on the experimental studies, the hydroxylated boron nitride was considered as the resting state of the catalyst. In the presence of O2 at high temperature, the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, leading to the generation of two radical species, BNO* and HO2* radicals"

[1] "Hermans and co-workers found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed."

[4] "To analyze the atomic arrangement and N-terminated porous structures of P-BN-6, zoom-in atomic-resolution STEM MAADF was performed (Figure 2c), providing evidence of a honeycomb texture."

[5] "DFT calculation indicated that the enhanced catalytic activity mainly originated from the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges."

[6] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained"

[7] "Moreover, the preferential N-terminated edges proved to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds, via both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration."

[8] "Hence, we suggest that the active site for current reaction on P-BN may be the N-terminated zigzags around pores."

[9] "To give direct evidence of the above conclusion, chemical titration was employed. To verify whether the active sites were located at edges, we used a ball-milled g-BN (g-BN-B) as the catalyst, which had more exposed edges than pristine g-BN."

[10] "These results showed that N-terminated edge sites are active sites, which is consistent with the DFT results. With abundant N-terminated edges from the Zn templates, the prepared P-BNs showed quite satisfying catalytic performance."

[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

          [2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

          [3] "We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

          [4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

          [5] "The EDS mapping of boron and nitrogen showed a highly and uniformly dispersed h-BN over the monolithic catalyst"

[1] "Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions."

[2] "To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (4857) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites."

[3] "The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site."

[4] "h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a)."

[5] "The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials."

[6] "DFT calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the OO bond created the BO and NO species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively."

[7] "On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the CC bond cleavage side reactions."

[8] "Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real BO active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved."

[9] "To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed."

[1] "The oxygenated boron sites at the surfaces of the h-BN and other bulky and supported boron-containing catalysts are the origin for catalyzing ODH reactions"

[2] "Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties"

[3] "The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite"

[4] "On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species"

[5] "Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen"

[6] "The isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane"

[1] "For these catalysts, the BOB oligomers are generally regarded as active centers (2628), whereas a single-site boron in zeolite (e.g., BMWW) is inert for the reaction (29)."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2A), where the fresh BS-1 exhibited a strong peak at 3.9 ppm assigned to tetracoordinated boron (B[4]) at the TO4 site of the zeolite framework (3134)."

[4] "Considering that boron species are isolated in BS-1, the aforementioned signals should result from the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure (Fig. 3B, II) (37)."

"Structural characterization revealed that the abundance of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) was responsible for the activity of propane ODH."

"Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

"Fig. 1 ac showed the SEM images of BZEO-1, BZEO-2 and BZEO-3 catalysts, and the BZEO zeolites were composed of intergrown, randomly-oriented, flaky crystals with particles of about 12 Î¼m in length and around 100 nm in thickness."

"TEM image further revealed that the lamellar zeolite consisted of rectilinear sheets with a clear crystallized structure"

[1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[3] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

"CNFs expose the basal plane edges. Therefore, CNFs can potentially have a higher density of defects (edges of basal planes) located on the outer surface, which are very accessible to reactants."

"The selective sites are reported to be quinone or dicarbonyl groups on the carbon surface, while carboxylic acids are unselective to propene and favour the complete oxidation of its double bond."

"A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice"

"The peak at BE=194.5eV (B2) that appears in the spectrum of the sample calcined at 773K (9%), which is larger for that calcined at 973K (49.6%), can be attributed to B2O3 clusters segregated on the CNF surface"

"As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) efficiently catalyzed ODHP, reaching a propylene selectivity of 80.2% with a little CO2 (0.5%) at propane conversion of 20.6%."

[3] "On the basis of understanding the reaction mechanism, B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst has been prepared, which performed higher catalytic activity because the abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species presented as active sites while the formation of BOSi bonds effectively anchored the boron species"

[4] "It should be pointed out that the tricoordinated BO species has been proposed as the active sites of the boron-based catalyst over ODHP."

[5] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[1] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[2] "Notably, s-BN manifested a remarkable 100% selectivity without any trace of byproducts at an ethane conversion of 9.2%."

[3] "Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

[4] "Given that the active sites are likely located at the edges of the s-BN nanosheets, these results indicate that the edge B atoms must be involved in O2 activation."

[5] "Under low-temperature conditions (X <10%, kinetic measuring region), ethane promotes the formation of BOH active sites, which thereby facilitates nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane by the aid of adsorbed O2 to produce ethylene and H2."

[6] "Notably, the appearance of CO ( =1067cm1) and BO ( =1220cm1) signatures17 at higher X (by reducing the GHSV, step4) corresponds to some loss in the S to CO production. This suggests there is sufficient time and temperature to allow O2 activation (and reaction) at the BN edges, which would create BO sites for enhanced X ."

[7] "At high reaction temperatures (X >10%, nonkinetic measuring region), the formation of BO active sites from adsorbed O2, which is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom from ethane to form C2H4 and H2O, cannot be ruled out."

[1] "Hermans and co-workers proposed that BOON, later on boron oxygen species were responsible for high activity and olefins selectivity that were influenced by electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures."

[2] "Our spectroscopic investigation suggested that the BOH could be the active sites which selectively broke the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2"

[3] "Su et al. proposed that and the BO(H) formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites for ethane ODH reaction."

[4] "Huang et al. reported that the BO sites formed at the edges of h-BN were the active sites in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "Grant et al. found that the high selectivity of propylene in the ODH of propane was related to the formation of BOx active site at the surfaces of h-BN and boron-containing catalysts."

[6] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[1] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[2] "TEM images viewed along the [001] direction (Figure2a and FigureS6) revealed that the most frequently exposed lateral termination facets were {10 0}, {01 0}, and {1 00}, suggesting that the terminated configuration had zigzag edges."

[3] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "Hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generates the active sites, which triggers propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "We have demonstrated that boron nitride, upon steam activation to generate BOH groups at the edges, efficiently catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with a superior selectivity toward propylene and a significantly minimized CO2 emission."

[6] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher Ï* to Ï* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge,9 and the B/N ratio (1.28, point2) at the edge was higher than that (0.95, point4) of the in-plane (Figure2b)."

[7] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Figure2d, inset)."

[8] "Upon exposure to C3H8 atmosphere at 530C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged, and no propane conversion was detected (Figure3a). With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened (Figure3a), accompanied with the formation of propylene, indicating that the OH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction network."

[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

          [2] "Based on the above considerations, in this work, a new h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was prepared by the electrospinning method, which exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction, with remarkably high productivity of propylene."

          [3] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst clearly showed higher propane conversion than the bulk h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction"

          [4] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

          [5] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

          [6] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts"

          [7] "In the previous work, based on various means of spectroscopy studies, we proposed the BOH at the edges and defects of h-BN as the active sites in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by means of experimental and theoretical methods, which was subsequently confirmed by other groups."

          [8] "In recent years, the superior activity of h-BN in ODHP was demonstrated, which inspired a wave for the research of boron-based ODHP catalysts. Meanwhile, the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in ODHP have been extensively studied."

[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[4] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[5] "One of the remaining drawbacks is the low overall activity of carbon catalysts, which can be overcome by fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface."

[1] "Boron-based catalysts have received significant attention for their inhibition of deep oxidation of olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process for the production of propylene"

[2] "The aggregated boron species embedded in MWW- and MFI-typed zeolite displayed high efficiency in activating propane"

[3] "Lately, the isolated boron site with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite showed durability in long period test and enabled the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through three hydrogen bonds on the boron site"

[4] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[5] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[6] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[3] "The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes."

[4] "Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes."

[5] "The open one-dimensional fiber structure allows easy diffusion and ensures high catalytic activity at high WHSV in the ODH of alkanes."

[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The identical product selectivity obtained with these electronically and structurally different bulk compounds suggests that each material, regardless of the non-boron constituent element within each compound, contains similar surface active sites that do not directly involve the non-boron constituent element."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

[5] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[6] "Even in the case of elemental B, the surface oxygen content amounts to 17% prior to the catalytic tests. Upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase, whereas concentrations of non-boron elements decrease."

[1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "This is drastically different from a 0D site (e.g., V/SiO2), which most likely creates a reactive propyl radical (34), or a 2D site [e.g., Cu(111) surface] where diffusion of adsorbates is unrestricted (35), both prone to overoxidation."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[5] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1) (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."

[1] "Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

[2] "Moreover, the B2O3@BPO4 composite was used as a SPLC for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperature (>450 C)."

[3] "In this work, a metal-free B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity and selectivity with productivity up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and high stability at 550 C, better than many metal-based catalysts"

[4] "At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene"

[5] "Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

[1] "The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts."

[2] "Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06)."

[3] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

[4] "Taken together these observations suggest that some boron spins are distant from protons, likely due to the formation of some boron oxide clusters in B/B-MWW."

[5] "The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides."

[1] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[2] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[3] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

[4] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[5] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[6] "The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN."

[1] "Boron nitride containing hydroxyl groups efficiently catalysed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, offering rather high selectivity (95%) but only small amount of CO2 formation (0.4%) at a given ethane conversion of 11%."

[2] "Independently, our group demonstrated that hydroxlated boron nitride can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with long reaction stability ad extremely low CO2 formation"

[3] "Structure evolution of the BNOH catalysts before and after ODH of ethane was characterized. XRD pattern (Fig. 2(a)) showed that the BNOH catalyst still retained the typical hexagonal layered structure after a 200-h reaction."

[4] "Based on catalytic, spectroscopic and kinetic data, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to understand the underlying possible reaction pathway."

[5] "Based on the experimental studies, the hydroxylated boron nitride was considered as the resting state of the catalyst. In the presence of O2 at high temperature, the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, leading to the generation of two radical species, BNO* and HO2* radicals"

[1] "Hermans and co-workers found that the commercially available h-BN functioned as an efficient catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whose catalytic activity and selectivity are even comparable to industrial supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[2] "Considering the analogous structure between graphene and h-BN, defective edges in h-BN would be catalytically active sites as well."

[3] "With numerous pores, a high specific surface area (SSA) can be expected and the active sites in the pristine regions can be exposed."

[4] "To analyze the atomic arrangement and N-terminated porous structures of P-BN-6, zoom-in atomic-resolution STEM MAADF was performed (Figure 2c), providing evidence of a honeycomb texture."

[5] "DFT calculation indicated that the enhanced catalytic activity mainly originated from the moderate dissociative energy of oxygen atoms on N-terminated edges."

[6] "With this strategy, artificially constructed N-terminated edges and a rather high SSA of up to 1579 m2 g1 were obtained"

[7] "Moreover, the preferential N-terminated edges proved to be active sites for the activation of oxygen in aerobic oxidation of aromatic sulfur compounds, via both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and chemical titration."

[8] "Hence, we suggest that the active site for current reaction on P-BN may be the N-terminated zigzags around pores."

[9] "To give direct evidence of the above conclusion, chemical titration was employed. To verify whether the active sites were located at edges, we used a ball-milled g-BN (g-BN-B) as the catalyst, which had more exposed edges than pristine g-BN."

[10] "These results showed that N-terminated edge sites are active sites, which is consistent with the DFT results. With abundant N-terminated edges from the Zn templates, the prepared P-BNs showed quite satisfying catalytic performance."

[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

          [2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

          [3] "We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

          [4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

          [5] "The EDS mapping of boron and nitrogen showed a highly and uniformly dispersed h-BN over the monolithic catalyst"
