The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by O-O bond cleavage to create B-O and N-O species.

2. Site activity: The zig-B edge was found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, with propane dehydrogenation occurring more easily on oxygen-modified edge sites.

3. Performance improvement strategies: Understanding the importance of edge sites has led to strategies for improving catalyst performance, such as:
   a) Preoxygen modification of edge sites to reduce the induction period and improve ODHP performance.
   b) Increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio.
   c) Creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites.

4. Addressing challenges: Researchers are working to overcome drawbacks associated with 1-D active sites, including the induction period, low density of edge active sites, and stability issues.

By understanding these unique properties and mechanisms, researchers can design more efficient B-based catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and increased olefin productivity, making them more suitable for commercial ODHP applications.

While the literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, it provides valuable insights into how different types of boron sites influence catalytic performance:

1. Surface distribution: Oxygenated boron sites on surfaces of various boron-containing catalysts are crucial for ODH reactions.

2. Homogeneous distribution: In borosilicate zeolites, a homogeneous distribution of boron proves promising for ODHP reactions.

3. Micro-environment: The micro-environment of boron species is the key factor affecting catalytic properties.

4. Isolated vs. defect sites: Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP, while defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing the reaction.

5. Aggregated species: Aggregated boron species are more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species.

6. Specific active structures: Boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions.

7. OH groups: Boron sites with more OH groups are more easily dehydrogenated by oxygen.

8. Hydrogen bonding: In some cases, like isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite, hydrogen bonding between BOH and adjacent SiOH facilitates synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

These findings suggest that the spatial arrangement, connectivity, and local environment of boron sites significantly impact catalyst performance. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it implies that more accessible and defective boron sites, which could potentially include edge sites, are generally more active for ODHP.

Understanding these structure-activity relationships can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by focusing on:

1. Maximizing defect boron sites and aggregated species
2. Ensuring homogeneous distribution while maintaining accessibility
3. Incorporating specific active structures like boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species
4. Optimizing OH group content on boron sites
5. Utilizing hydrogen bonding to enhance synergistic conversions

These insights can lead to the development of catalysts with improved performance in ODHP reactions at lower temperatures, potentially enhancing their commercial viability.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature challenges conventional understanding by introducing a new type of active center - isolated boron species with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in a borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1). This differs from traditional catalysts containing BOB oligomers (likely 2D or 3D structures) as active centers.

The isolated nature of these boron sites in the zeolite framework appears crucial for their catalytic activity. This represents a shift from 2D/3D structures to more 1D-like isolated sites. The specific coordination environment of boron in the zeolite framework, particularly the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, as well as improved water tolerance and durability compared to conventional boron catalysts.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts in several ways:

1. It challenges previous assumptions about active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP.
2. It demonstrates that isolated boron species, when properly coordinated within a zeolite framework, can be highly active and selective for ODHP.
3. The zeolite framework provides a confined environment that may contribute to reaction activity and selectivity.
4. The isolated nature of the boron sites appears to provide better stability and water tolerance.

This new understanding of isolated boron sites opens up opportunities for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, potentially leading to more effective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it highlights the importance of controlling the spatial distribution and local environment of boron sites to significantly influence catalyst performance.

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides some relevant information:

1. The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites, which are 2D structures. These catalysts showed good performance in ODHP reactions, suggesting that 2D distributions of active sites can be effective.

2. The active sites were identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) on the surface of the catalyst. This indicates that surface-accessible active sites are important for ODHP reactions.

3. The catalyst particles were described as flaky crystals with specific dimensions (about 1-2 Î¼m in length and 100 nm in thickness), implying that the spatial arrangement of active sites may play a role in catalyst performance.

4. The 2D lamellar structure likely provides good accessibility to active sites, which could contribute to the catalyst's effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

While the study does not explicitly compare 1D, 2D, and 3D distributions of active sites or discuss 1D edge active sites, it demonstrates that understanding the nature and location of active sites (in this case, surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species) is crucial for designing efficient ODHP catalysts.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, this research indicates that focusing on creating and optimizing surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species in layered structures could be a promising approach. Further studies comparing different spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites would be beneficial for advancing catalyst design for ODHP reactions.

The provided literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention the use of boron nitride (BN) materials with specific structural features for this application.

The document describes a BN-based monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure. This structure provides a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which are beneficial for catalysis. The foam consists of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This unique arrangement likely influences the spatial distribution of active sites.

The literature reports that pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This foam demonstrates excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The hierarchical porous structure may contribute to the efficient distribution of active sites and facilitate the ODHP reaction.

While the document does not specifically discuss the dimensionality of active sites or the unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, it does highlight the importance of structural design in creating efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions. The oriented bowl-like structure and hierarchical porosity of the BN-based foam appear to play crucial roles in its catalytic performance.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface, which contributes to their catalytic effectiveness.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon surfaces are primarily quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these sites and their distribution.

The dimensionality of active sites varies with calcination temperature:

1-D sites: At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron predominantly forms B-O-C structures, with boron linked to three oxygen atoms or forming (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. These 1-D structures along the edges of the CNFs contribute to selective dehydrogenation.

3-D sites: As calcination temperature increases (973K and above), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface, creating a more 3-D distribution of active sites. New B species continue to develop at even higher temperatures.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading, it's possible to optimize the distribution of active sites, maximizing selectivity towards propene while maintaining high conversion rates. This knowledge allows for the development of catalysts with improved performance and stability, potentially bringing ODHP processes closer to commercial viability.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D distributions specifically, it highlights several important aspects:

1. Edge active sites (1-D): The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) showed high propylene selectivity, suggesting that 1-D edge sites can be highly effective for ODHP reactions.

2. Surface-distributed sites (2-D): B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface, indicating the importance of well-distributed 2-D active sites.

3. Structural considerations (3-D): The use of honeycomb cordierite structures with straight channels allows for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer, while thin wash-coated B2O3 layers facilitate pore diffusion, suggesting the importance of 3-D structural design in catalyst performance.

4. Anchoring mechanisms: The formation of B-O-Si bonds effectively anchored boron species, which likely contributes to better stability and distribution of active sites.

5. Active site nature: Tricoordinated BO species are proposed as the active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP, suggesting that the local coordination environment is crucial for catalytic activity.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to catalyst design by:

1. Emphasizing the importance of creating accessible edge sites or surface-distributed active centers.
2. Highlighting the need for proper anchoring mechanisms to stabilize active species.
3. Focusing on the creation and preservation of specific coordination environments (e.g., tricoordinated boron) that are conducive to ODHP reactions.
4. Considering 3-D structural design to optimize mass transfer and reactant accessibility.

These insights can guide the development of more efficient catalysts with optimized spatial distributions of active sites, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability for commercial ODHP applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically BN nanosheets, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. While the study focuses on ethane ODH rather than propane, the insights can be applied to similar reactions:

1. Spatial Distribution: The active sites are primarily located at the edges of the BN nanosheets, indicating a 1-D distribution. This edge-specific activity is crucial for the catalyst's performance, as evidenced by the high selectivity (100% at 9.2% conversion) achieved.

2. Dimensionality: The catalyst consists of 2-D BN nanosheets, but the active sites are confined to the 1-D edges. This unique structure contributes to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. Active Site Properties: The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, forming BOH and BO active sites. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation process without dissociating O2, contributing to high selectivity by preventing overoxidation.

4. Reaction Mechanisms: Two catalytic pathways are identified based on reaction conditions:
   a) At low temperatures (X <10%): BOH active sites form, promoting direct dehydrogenation of ethane.
   b) At high temperatures (X >10%): BO active sites form, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane.

5. Performance Influence: The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to high selectivity and conversion rates. The majority of the catalyst surface remains inactive, emphasizing the importance of edge sites.

Understanding these aspects contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:
1. Focusing on maximizing edge exposure in BN-based materials.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions to control the formation of specific active sites (BOH vs. BO).
3. Developing synthesis methods that prioritize the formation of active edge sites.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize edge structures for long-term catalytic performance.

While this study focused on ethane ODH, similar principles could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for propane ODH and other related reactions in commercial applications.

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into the nature and location of active sites that can be related to their spatial distribution and dimensionality.

Boron-oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are identified as responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN, indicating a preference for 1-D edge sites. The formation of BOx active sites on surfaces of h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts is related to high propylene selectivity.

The electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures influence catalyst performance, suggesting that the local environment of the active sites plays a crucial role. The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts may result from differences in subsurface structure, implying that the 3-D arrangement of boron species within the catalyst bulk can impact catalytic performance.

Understanding the importance of edge sites and their unique properties can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on maximizing the number of accessible edge sites and optimizing their local environment, researchers may be able to develop catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how 2-D or 3-D distributions of active sites might affect catalyst performance, nor does it directly compare the efficiency of different spatial distributions. Further research would be needed to fully understand the impact of active site dimensionality on ODHP reactions and to leverage this knowledge for catalyst design and commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites are primarily located at the edges of boron nitride sheets, creating a 1-D distribution of active sites. These edge sites, particularly the BOH groups, play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance.

The steam activation process creates a large number of edges with zigzag configurations, increasing the number of potential active sites. The boron species at these edges bond with oxygen, forming BOH groups that are key to the catalyst's activity. The edges have distinct properties compared to the in-plane structure, including a higher Ï* to Ï* ratio and a higher B/N ratio.

The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the catalyst's high selectivity and efficiency. The BOH groups at the edges interact with molecular oxygen, creating dynamic active sites that selectively trigger propane dehydrogenation. This mechanism allows for efficient propane conversion while minimizing unwanted CO2 production.

Understanding these 1-D edge active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst demonstrates superior selectivity toward propylene and significantly minimized CO2 emission. By focusing on enhancing the formation and properties of these edge sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved selectivity, stability, and efficiency for ODHP reactions. This approach offers a promising direction for creating metal-free catalysts that can outperform traditional metal-based systems in terms of both activity and selectivity.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional structures, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study, show superior performance compared to bulk or 3D catalysts. This is primarily due to:

          1. Enhanced exposure of active sites: The 1D structure facilitates better exposure of catalytic sites, allowing more sites to participate in the reaction. The BOH groups at the edges and defects of h-BN have been identified as the active sites for ODHP reactions.

          2. Improved mass transfer: The fibrous structure enhances the transmission of substances, allowing reactants to more easily reach active sites.

          3. Higher catalytic efficiency: The nanofiber catalyst demonstrated remarkably higher productivity of olefins (24.9golefinsgBN1h1) compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts, especially under high space velocity conditions.

          4. Better stability and selectivity: The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction.

          Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing active site exposure and improving mass transfer. This knowledge guides the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications, focusing on creating structures that optimize these beneficial characteristics of 1D catalysts. The extensive research on the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in ODHP has led to a wave of research in boron-based ODHP catalysts, further advancing the field.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The boron species are highly dispersed throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, creating a complex distribution of active sites:

1. 1-D distribution: The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, creating 1-D edge active sites along the CNT length.

2. 2-D distribution: A minor fraction covers the outer CNT surface as a thin amorphous coating of about 1-2 nm thickness.

3. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer: BOx species are omnipresent, potentially creating 0-D or isolated active sites.

The unique properties of these active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, contribute to enhanced catalytic performance:

1. Improved thermal stability due to covalent bonding to the CNT structure.
2. B2O3 filling acts as a backbone against oxidation.
3. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter inhibits dissociative adsorption of O2, maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
4. Suppressed total combustion reactions and lower reoxidation capacity of active sites lead to enhanced propene selectivity.

Understanding these properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Optimizing the distribution and concentration of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.
2. Improving thermal stability and resistance to oxidation for longer-lasting catalysts.
3. Leveraging the highly dispersed nature of boron species to potentially reduce material costs.
4. Using the unique 1-D structure of CNTs with B-doping as a model system for studying reaction mechanisms.
5. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst through controlled B-doping for improved selectivity and efficiency.

To overcome the drawback of low overall activity in carbon catalysts, future research should focus on fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface while maintaining the advantages of boron modification.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Different structures of boron-containing catalysts, such as zeolites, h-BN, and B2O3, offer unique properties that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

Key points about the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality:

1. Aggregated boron species in MWW- and MFI-type zeolites show high efficiency in activating propane.
2. Isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.
3. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.
4. The extra-large micropores in embryonic zeolitic materials improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: Boron-based catalysts inhibit deep oxidation of olefins, leading to higher propylene selectivity.
2. Enhanced durability: Isolated boron sites in zeolites show long-term stability, crucial for commercial applications.
3. Optimized porosity: Extra-large microporosity improves mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.
4. Balanced reaction pathways: Understanding the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase radical reactions allows for optimizing both pathways for improved overall activity.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop B-based catalysts with tailored spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites, leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial use.

While the provided literature does not directly address how different spatial distributions and dimensionalities (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions, it does highlight the advantages of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts synthesized by electrospinning.

The one-dimensional structure of PBSN catalysts offers several benefits:

1. Higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts.
2. Prevention of diffusion limitations due to the open pore structures.
3. High catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
4. Uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework.

These properties suggest that the one-dimensional structure of PBSN catalysts contributes significantly to their improved performance in ODH reactions. The open fiber structure likely provides better accessibility to active sites and facilitates mass transfer, which could explain the higher activity and selectivity observed.

Understanding these properties could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.
2. Utilizing the benefits of one-dimensional structures to improve diffusion and stability.
3. Exploring ways to further enhance the uniform dispersion of active species on the catalyst surface.
4. Developing synthesis methods that can precisely control the dimensionality and distribution of active sites.

To further advance catalyst design, future research could focus on:

1. Comparing the performance of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D boron-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.
2. Investigating the specific role of edge active sites in one-dimensional structures.
3. Studying the reaction mechanisms on different types of active sites in various dimensionalities.

While the document does not explicitly discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites, the improved performance of PBSN catalysts indicates that understanding and optimizing one-dimensional structures could be valuable for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalyst performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides several relevant insights:

1. The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity across various boron-containing materials, regardless of their structure or non-boron constituents.

2. The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boron materials may influence the extent of surface oxidation and active site density. Layered borides (2D structures like NiB, TiB2, hBN) and tetragonal borides (3D structures like WB, Co2B) may present different boron surface concentrations, affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH.

3. Various B-containing materials, including 2D structures like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and 3D structures like boron carbide (B4C) and metal borides, all catalyze the ODHP reaction with similar product distributions. This suggests that the dimensionality of the bulk structure may not be the primary factor determining catalyst performance.

4. The study emphasizes the importance of surface-stabilized BOx sites in the catalytic process, rather than edge sites or specific dimensionality. The formation of these active sites appears to be a key factor in catalyst performance, regardless of the bulk material's dimensionality.

5. The research shows that upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase while concentrations of non-boron elements decrease, further supporting the importance of BOx species formation.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, the insights into the nature of active sites and the influence of crystal structure on their formation could guide future catalyst design efforts. Understanding the relationship between crystal structure, surface boron concentration, and BOx formation could potentially be used to develop catalysts with optimized surface structures and compositions to maximize the formation of these active sites, thereby improving catalytic performance in commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research proposes that oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges act as the catalytic active sites, which are one-dimensional (1D) in nature.

The 1D edge structure of BN catalysts offers unique advantages over 0D and 2D catalysts:

1. Unlike 0D sites (e.g., V/SiO2) that tend to create highly reactive propyl radicals, the 1D edge sites in BN catalysts stabilize the propyl radical.
2. Unlike 2D sites (e.g., Cu(111) surfaces) where adsorbates can freely diffuse, the 1D nature of BN edges suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (>BOON<) at the armchair edge of BN. This structure allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals through the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate with a nitroxyl radical site.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The high reactivity and selectivity observed with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) result in enhanced propene productivity, reaching levels that are considered attractive for commercial implementation of on-purpose propene technology.

By leveraging the insights gained from studying these 1D edge active sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts that offer improved selectivity and productivity in ODHP reactions. This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design, focusing on creating materials with optimized edge structures and controlled dimensionality to achieve better performance in commercial ODHP applications, potentially leading to more economical and environmentally friendly processes for propene production.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The B2O3@BPO4 catalyst features a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, where 1-D B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres. This structure maximizes the utilization of both sides of the support, which is uncommon in hollow-sphere structures.

At reaction temperatures above 450Â°C, melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as the catalytically active species. This arrangement provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites, contributing to the catalyst's excellent performance in ODHP reactions.

The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity, selectivity, and stability in ODHP reactions at 550Â°C, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1, surpassing many metal-based catalysts. This high performance can be attributed to the unique spatial distribution and dimensionality of the active sites, particularly the 1-D B2O3 nanowires covering the 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The sandwich-like structure and the use of melted B2O3 as an active species demonstrate a novel approach to catalyst design, combining the advantages of supported liquid-phase catalysts with the benefits of hollow sphere supports.

While the provided information doesn't explicitly discuss the reaction mechanisms of these sites, the high performance of this catalyst structure implies that the 1-D B2O3 nanowires may provide advantageous active sites for ODHP reactions. This insight could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by suggesting that incorporating 1-D structures or edge active sites in B-based catalysts might be beneficial for ODHP reactions.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units are not the active sites for ODHP, contrary to previous hypotheses. Instead, the active sites require some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that a more complex, multi-dimensional structure is necessary for catalytic activity.

The research shows that active B-based ODH catalysts form an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface during reaction conditions. This phase consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups, represented by the formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06). This structure indicates that the active sites are not limited to 1-D configurations but likely involve 2-D or 3-D arrangements of boron atoms.

The study also highlights the dynamic nature of these active sites. Under reaction conditions (500Â°C), the boron oxide phase becomes highly dynamic, undergoing restructuring. This suggests that the dimensionality of the active sites may not be static but can change during the reaction process.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It shifts focus from isolated BO3 sites to more complex boron structures with B-O-B connectivity.
2. It emphasizes the importance of creating catalysts that can form and maintain the necessary amorphous boron oxide phase under reaction conditions.
3. It suggests that catalyst designs should consider the dynamic nature of the active sites and potentially incorporate features that promote beneficial restructuring during reactions.
4. It indicates that future catalyst development should focus on optimizing the spatial distribution and connectivity of boron sites rather than maximizing the number of isolated boron atoms.

These insights provide a foundation for developing new strategies in catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, which are 2D materials with active sites primarily located on the surface.

Key findings include:

1. Three-boron center (TBC) N-defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion.
2. There is a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC), suggesting these defects are more important for catalytic activity than g2 defects (one-boron center, OBC).
3. Aggregated boron sites are favored to become active sites, implying that the spatial distribution of these sites affects catalyst performance.
4. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520Â°C.
5. The dimensionality of the catalyst structure impacts performance, as demonstrated by the reduced activity of O2-BN due to sintering of BN nanosheets.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Highlighting the importance of creating and maintaining TBC N-defects.
2. Emphasizing the need to prevent sintering and maintain the 2D structure of BN nanosheets.
3. Suggesting that methods to increase the concentration of edge sites, where TBC defects are more likely to form, could enhance catalytic performance.
4. Demonstrating the potential of plasma treatment as a method for selectively creating desired defect structures.

While the study does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, the emphasis on TBC defects and their evolution into active BOx species under ODH conditions suggests that edge sites, where such defects are more likely to occur, could be particularly important for catalytic activity.

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it provides insights into the behavior of hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

The study focuses on BNOH catalysts, which contain hydroxyl groups at the edges. These edge BOH groups play a crucial role in the catalytic process, indicating a 1-D distribution of active sites. The BNOH catalyst retains a hexagonal layered structure, suggesting a 2-D configuration with 1-D edge active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, generating BNO* and HO2* radicals. These radicals then participate in the activation of ethane or propane and their subsequent conversion to ethylene or propylene. This understanding of the reaction pathway at the edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of edge functionalization and the role of hydroxyl groups.

The high selectivity, stability, and low CO2 formation observed in this catalyst system suggest that understanding and optimizing the 1-D edge active sites could lead to improved catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. To design more efficient catalysts, researchers could focus on:

1. Maximizing the number of edge sites in boron nitride-based materials
2. Optimizing the hydroxylation process to increase the density of active BOH groups
3. Exploring other edge functionalization strategies that might enhance catalytic performance
4. Investigating the stability and regeneration of edge active sites under reaction conditions

These approaches, based on the understanding of 1-D edge active sites in 2-D materials, could contribute to the development of more effective and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions and related oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research focuses on the importance of 1-D edge active sites, especially N-terminated edges, in enhancing catalytic activity.

Key findings include:

1. Defective edges in h-BN function as catalytically active sites, similar to those in graphene.
2. N-terminated edges are particularly effective for oxygen activation, crucial for oxidation reactions.
3. Creating porous structures with high specific surface areas (up to 1579 m2/g) exposes more active sites, enhancing overall catalytic performance.
4. The spatial distribution of active sites is optimized by generating abundant N-terminated edges around pores.
5. The dimensionality of active sites is primarily 1-D, focusing on edge sites rather than planar or 3-D structures.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Increasing the density and accessibility of active sites through porous structures.
2. Tailoring edge termination to optimize catalytic properties.
3. Developing targeted synthesis methods, such as using Zn templates, to create catalysts with optimized active site distributions.
4. Providing insights into structure-activity relationships, allowing for more rational catalyst design.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on ODHP reactions, the principles of tailoring edge sites and understanding their role in oxygen activation could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for ODHP and other oxidation reactions in commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) demonstrates superior activity and selectivity compared to traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of h-BN, particularly its 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in its performance:

          1. Edge active sites: The edge BOH groups are key in the reaction mechanism, being dehydrogenated by O2 to generate BO and HO2 radicals. These radicals facilitate hydrogen abstraction from alkanes, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

          2. Thermal conductivity: The superior thermal conductivity of h-BN helps avoid hotspots during the reaction, leading to better control and improved selectivity. This is a significant advantage over traditional catalysts like VOx/Î³-Al2O3.

          3. Spatial distribution: The uniform dispersion of h-BN over monolithic catalysts contributes to its high performance. The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, enhancing propane conversion compared to h-BN powder.

          Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of 1-D edge active sites and the benefits of 2-D and 3-D structures, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the exposure and density of edge sites, channel structures, and thermal properties, researchers can potentially enhance the catalytic performance and selectivity towards desired products.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D), and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites.

1-D active sites, which are linearly dispersed on the edge of 2-D h-BN sheets, have shown superior performance in ODHP reactions. For example, h-BN with 1-D edge active sites exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%, outperforming conventional catalysts like V/SiO2.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations revealed that the reaction starts with hydrogen abstraction from the second carbon of propane, followed by O-O bond cleavage to create B-O and N-O species.

2. Site activity: The zig-B edge was found to be more active than the armchair or zig-N edge sites, with propane dehydrogenation occurring more easily on oxygen-modified edge sites.

3. Performance improvement strategies: Understanding the importance of edge sites has led to strategies for improving catalyst performance, such as:
   a) Preoxygen modification of edge sites to reduce the induction period and improve ODHP performance.
   b) Increasing the density of edge sites by reducing the size of BN nanosheets and increasing the edge/surface ratio.
   c) Creating 1-D shaped materials to increase the number of active sites.

4. Addressing challenges: Researchers are working to overcome drawbacks associated with 1-D active sites, including the induction period, low density of edge active sites, and stability issues.

By understanding these unique properties and mechanisms, researchers can design more efficient B-based catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and increased olefin productivity, making them more suitable for commercial ODHP applications.

While the literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions, it provides valuable insights into how different types of boron sites influence catalytic performance:

1. Surface distribution: Oxygenated boron sites on surfaces of various boron-containing catalysts are crucial for ODH reactions.

2. Homogeneous distribution: In borosilicate zeolites, a homogeneous distribution of boron proves promising for ODHP reactions.

3. Micro-environment: The micro-environment of boron species is the key factor affecting catalytic properties.

4. Isolated vs. defect sites: Isolated B(OSi)3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are inactive for ODHP, while defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing the reaction.

5. Aggregated species: Aggregated boron species are more efficient in C-H bond activation of propane compared to isolated species.

6. Specific active structures: Boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species are responsible for low-temperature ODHP reactions.

7. OH groups: Boron sites with more OH groups are more easily dehydrogenated by oxygen.

8. Hydrogen bonding: In some cases, like isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite, hydrogen bonding between BOH and adjacent SiOH facilitates synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

These findings suggest that the spatial arrangement, connectivity, and local environment of boron sites significantly impact catalyst performance. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it implies that more accessible and defective boron sites, which could potentially include edge sites, are generally more active for ODHP.

Understanding these structure-activity relationships can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by focusing on:

1. Maximizing defect boron sites and aggregated species
2. Ensuring homogeneous distribution while maintaining accessibility
3. Incorporating specific active structures like boroxol rings and tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species
4. Optimizing OH group content on boron sites
5. Utilizing hydrogen bonding to enhance synergistic conversions

These insights can lead to the development of catalysts with improved performance in ODHP reactions at lower temperatures, potentially enhancing their commercial viability.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The literature challenges conventional understanding by introducing a new type of active center - isolated boron species with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in a borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1). This differs from traditional catalysts containing BOB oligomers (likely 2D or 3D structures) as active centers.

The isolated nature of these boron sites in the zeolite framework appears crucial for their catalytic activity. This represents a shift from 2D/3D structures to more 1D-like isolated sites. The specific coordination environment of boron in the zeolite framework, particularly the B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure, shows high activity and selectivity for ODHP, as well as improved water tolerance and durability compared to conventional boron catalysts.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of isolated boron sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts in several ways:

1. It challenges previous assumptions about active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP.
2. It demonstrates that isolated boron species, when properly coordinated within a zeolite framework, can be highly active and selective for ODHP.
3. The zeolite framework provides a confined environment that may contribute to reaction activity and selectivity.
4. The isolated nature of the boron sites appears to provide better stability and water tolerance.

This new understanding of isolated boron sites opens up opportunities for rational design of efficient dehydrogenation catalysts, potentially leading to more effective catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, it highlights the importance of controlling the spatial distribution and local environment of boron sites to significantly influence catalyst performance.

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides some relevant information:

1. The study focuses on layered borosilicate zeolites, which are 2D structures. These catalysts showed good performance in ODHP reactions, suggesting that 2D distributions of active sites can be effective.

2. The active sites were identified as defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) on the surface of the catalyst. This indicates that surface-accessible active sites are important for ODHP reactions.

3. The catalyst particles were described as flaky crystals with specific dimensions (about 1-2 Î¼m in length and 100 nm in thickness), implying that the spatial arrangement of active sites may play a role in catalyst performance.

4. The 2D lamellar structure likely provides good accessibility to active sites, which could contribute to the catalyst's effectiveness in ODHP reactions.

While the study does not explicitly compare 1D, 2D, and 3D distributions of active sites or discuss 1D edge active sites, it demonstrates that understanding the nature and location of active sites (in this case, surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species) is crucial for designing efficient ODHP catalysts.

To design more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, this research indicates that focusing on creating and optimizing surface-accessible defective trigonal boron species in layered structures could be a promising approach. Further studies comparing different spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites would be beneficial for advancing catalyst design for ODHP reactions.

The provided literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention the use of boron nitride (BN) materials with specific structural features for this application.

The document describes a BN-based monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure. This structure provides a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which are beneficial for catalysis. The foam consists of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This unique arrangement likely influences the spatial distribution of active sites.

The literature reports that pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This foam demonstrates excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The hierarchical porous structure may contribute to the efficient distribution of active sites and facilitate the ODHP reaction.

While the document does not specifically discuss the dimensionality of active sites or the unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, it does highlight the importance of structural design in creating efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions. The oriented bowl-like structure and hierarchical porosity of the BN-based foam appear to play crucial roles in its catalytic performance.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) expose basal plane edges, providing a high density of accessible defect sites on the outer surface, which contributes to their catalytic effectiveness.

The active sites for ODHP reactions on carbon surfaces are primarily quinone or dicarbonyl groups, while carboxylic acids are unselective and promote complete oxidation. The introduction of boron modifies these sites and their distribution.

The dimensionality of active sites varies with calcination temperature:

1-D sites: At lower temperatures (673-773K), boron predominantly forms B-O-C structures, with boron linked to three oxygen atoms or forming (BO3)n chains bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice. These 1-D structures along the edges of the CNFs contribute to selective dehydrogenation.

3-D sites: As calcination temperature increases (973K and above), B2O3 clusters form on the CNF surface, creating a more 3-D distribution of active sites. New B species continue to develop at even higher temperatures.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By controlling the calcination temperature and boron loading, it's possible to optimize the distribution of active sites, maximizing selectivity towards propene while maintaining high conversion rates. This knowledge allows for the development of catalysts with improved performance and stability, potentially bringing ODHP processes closer to commercial viability.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. While the literature doesn't provide extensive details on 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D distributions specifically, it highlights several important aspects:

1. Edge active sites (1-D): The edge hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) showed high propylene selectivity, suggesting that 1-D edge sites can be highly effective for ODHP reactions.

2. Surface-distributed sites (2-D): B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts demonstrated higher activity due to abundant tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species on the surface, indicating the importance of well-distributed 2-D active sites.

3. Structural considerations (3-D): The use of honeycomb cordierite structures with straight channels allows for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer, while thin wash-coated B2O3 layers facilitate pore diffusion, suggesting the importance of 3-D structural design in catalyst performance.

4. Anchoring mechanisms: The formation of B-O-Si bonds effectively anchored boron species, which likely contributes to better stability and distribution of active sites.

5. Active site nature: Tricoordinated BO species are proposed as the active sites for boron-based catalysts in ODHP, suggesting that the local coordination environment is crucial for catalytic activity.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to catalyst design by:

1. Emphasizing the importance of creating accessible edge sites or surface-distributed active centers.
2. Highlighting the need for proper anchoring mechanisms to stabilize active species.
3. Focusing on the creation and preservation of specific coordination environments (e.g., tricoordinated boron) that are conducive to ODHP reactions.
4. Considering 3-D structural design to optimize mass transfer and reactant accessibility.

These insights can guide the development of more efficient catalysts with optimized spatial distributions of active sites, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability for commercial ODHP applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, specifically BN nanosheets, significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. While the study focuses on ethane ODH rather than propane, the insights can be applied to similar reactions:

1. Spatial Distribution: The active sites are primarily located at the edges of the BN nanosheets, indicating a 1-D distribution. This edge-specific activity is crucial for the catalyst's performance, as evidenced by the high selectivity (100% at 9.2% conversion) achieved.

2. Dimensionality: The catalyst consists of 2-D BN nanosheets, but the active sites are confined to the 1-D edges. This unique structure contributes to the high selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. Active Site Properties: The edge B atoms are involved in O2 activation, forming BOH and BO active sites. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation process without dissociating O2, contributing to high selectivity by preventing overoxidation.

4. Reaction Mechanisms: Two catalytic pathways are identified based on reaction conditions:
   a) At low temperatures (X <10%): BOH active sites form, promoting direct dehydrogenation of ethane.
   b) At high temperatures (X >10%): BO active sites form, capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane.

5. Performance Influence: The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to high selectivity and conversion rates. The majority of the catalyst surface remains inactive, emphasizing the importance of edge sites.

Understanding these aspects contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:
1. Focusing on maximizing edge exposure in BN-based materials.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions to control the formation of specific active sites (BOH vs. BO).
3. Developing synthesis methods that prioritize the formation of active edge sites.
4. Exploring ways to stabilize edge structures for long-term catalytic performance.

While this study focused on ethane ODH, similar principles could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for propane ODH and other related reactions in commercial applications.

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it provides insights into the nature and location of active sites that can be related to their spatial distribution and dimensionality.

Boron-oxygen species, particularly BOH and BO(H) groups, are identified as responsible for high activity and selectivity in ODH reactions. These active sites are often found at the edges of boron-containing materials like h-BN, indicating a preference for 1-D edge sites. The formation of BOx active sites on surfaces of h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts is related to high propylene selectivity.

The electronic interactions between active sites and adjacent structures influence catalyst performance, suggesting that the local environment of the active sites plays a crucial role. The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts may result from differences in subsurface structure, implying that the 3-D arrangement of boron species within the catalyst bulk can impact catalytic performance.

Understanding the importance of edge sites and their unique properties can guide the design of more efficient catalysts. By focusing on maximizing the number of accessible edge sites and optimizing their local environment, researchers may be able to develop catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for commercial ODHP applications.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how 2-D or 3-D distributions of active sites might affect catalyst performance, nor does it directly compare the efficiency of different spatial distributions. Further research would be needed to fully understand the impact of active site dimensionality on ODHP reactions and to leverage this knowledge for catalyst design and commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The active sites are primarily located at the edges of boron nitride sheets, creating a 1-D distribution of active sites. These edge sites, particularly the BOH groups, play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance.

The steam activation process creates a large number of edges with zigzag configurations, increasing the number of potential active sites. The boron species at these edges bond with oxygen, forming BOH groups that are key to the catalyst's activity. The edges have distinct properties compared to the in-plane structure, including a higher Ï* to Ï* ratio and a higher B/N ratio.

The unique properties of these 1-D edge active sites contribute to the catalyst's high selectivity and efficiency. The BOH groups at the edges interact with molecular oxygen, creating dynamic active sites that selectively trigger propane dehydrogenation. This mechanism allows for efficient propane conversion while minimizing unwanted CO2 production.

Understanding these 1-D edge active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalyst demonstrates superior selectivity toward propylene and significantly minimized CO2 emission. By focusing on enhancing the formation and properties of these edge sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts with improved selectivity, stability, and efficiency for ODHP reactions. This approach offers a promising direction for creating metal-free catalysts that can outperform traditional metal-based systems in terms of both activity and selectivity.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. One-dimensional structures, such as the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study, show superior performance compared to bulk or 3D catalysts. This is primarily due to:

          1. Enhanced exposure of active sites: The 1D structure facilitates better exposure of catalytic sites, allowing more sites to participate in the reaction. The BOH groups at the edges and defects of h-BN have been identified as the active sites for ODHP reactions.

          2. Improved mass transfer: The fibrous structure enhances the transmission of substances, allowing reactants to more easily reach active sites.

          3. Higher catalytic efficiency: The nanofiber catalyst demonstrated remarkably higher productivity of olefins (24.9golefinsgBN1h1) compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts, especially under high space velocity conditions.

          4. Better stability and selectivity: The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for the ODHP reaction.

          Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes to catalyst design by highlighting the importance of maximizing active site exposure and improving mass transfer. This knowledge guides the development of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications, focusing on creating structures that optimize these beneficial characteristics of 1D catalysts. The extensive research on the active origin and reaction mechanism of h-BN in ODHP has led to a wave of research in boron-based ODHP catalysts, further advancing the field.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The boron species are highly dispersed throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, creating a complex distribution of active sites:

1. 1-D distribution: The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, creating 1-D edge active sites along the CNT length.

2. 2-D distribution: A minor fraction covers the outer CNT surface as a thin amorphous coating of about 1-2 nm thickness.

3. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer: BOx species are omnipresent, potentially creating 0-D or isolated active sites.

The unique properties of these active sites, particularly the 1-D edge sites, contribute to enhanced catalytic performance:

1. Improved thermal stability due to covalent bonding to the CNT structure.
2. B2O3 filling acts as a backbone against oxidation.
3. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter inhibits dissociative adsorption of O2, maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
4. Suppressed total combustion reactions and lower reoxidation capacity of active sites lead to enhanced propene selectivity.

Understanding these properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Optimizing the distribution and concentration of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.
2. Improving thermal stability and resistance to oxidation for longer-lasting catalysts.
3. Leveraging the highly dispersed nature of boron species to potentially reduce material costs.
4. Using the unique 1-D structure of CNTs with B-doping as a model system for studying reaction mechanisms.
5. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst through controlled B-doping for improved selectivity and efficiency.

To overcome the drawback of low overall activity in carbon catalysts, future research should focus on fabricating a high concentration of selective sites on the surface while maintaining the advantages of boron modification.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Different structures of boron-containing catalysts, such as zeolites, h-BN, and B2O3, offer unique properties that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

Key points about the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality:

1. Aggregated boron species in MWW- and MFI-type zeolites show high efficiency in activating propane.
2. Isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.
3. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.
4. The extra-large micropores in embryonic zeolitic materials improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: Boron-based catalysts inhibit deep oxidation of olefins, leading to higher propylene selectivity.
2. Enhanced durability: Isolated boron sites in zeolites show long-term stability, crucial for commercial applications.
3. Optimized porosity: Extra-large microporosity improves mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.
4. Balanced reaction pathways: Understanding the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase radical reactions allows for optimizing both pathways for improved overall activity.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop B-based catalysts with tailored spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites, leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial use.

While the provided literature does not directly address how different spatial distributions and dimensionalities (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions, it does highlight the advantages of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts synthesized by electrospinning.

The one-dimensional structure of PBSN catalysts offers several benefits:

1. Higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts.
2. Prevention of diffusion limitations due to the open pore structures.
3. High catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
4. Uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework.

These properties suggest that the one-dimensional structure of PBSN catalysts contributes significantly to their improved performance in ODH reactions. The open fiber structure likely provides better accessibility to active sites and facilitates mass transfer, which could explain the higher activity and selectivity observed.

Understanding these properties could contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites to maximize catalytic performance.
2. Utilizing the benefits of one-dimensional structures to improve diffusion and stability.
3. Exploring ways to further enhance the uniform dispersion of active species on the catalyst surface.
4. Developing synthesis methods that can precisely control the dimensionality and distribution of active sites.

To further advance catalyst design, future research could focus on:

1. Comparing the performance of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D boron-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.
2. Investigating the specific role of edge active sites in one-dimensional structures.
3. Studying the reaction mechanisms on different types of active sites in various dimensionalities.

While the document does not explicitly discuss the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites, the improved performance of PBSN catalysts indicates that understanding and optimizing one-dimensional structures could be valuable for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

The literature does not directly address the influence of spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites on B-based catalyst performance in ODHP reactions. However, it provides several relevant insights:

1. The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, it suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are responsible for the catalytic activity across various boron-containing materials, regardless of their structure or non-boron constituents.

2. The research indicates that the crystal structure of the boron materials may influence the extent of surface oxidation and active site density. Layered borides (2D structures like NiB, TiB2, hBN) and tetragonal borides (3D structures like WB, Co2B) may present different boron surface concentrations, affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH.

3. Various B-containing materials, including 2D structures like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and 3D structures like boron carbide (B4C) and metal borides, all catalyze the ODHP reaction with similar product distributions. This suggests that the dimensionality of the bulk structure may not be the primary factor determining catalyst performance.

4. The study emphasizes the importance of surface-stabilized BOx sites in the catalytic process, rather than edge sites or specific dimensionality. The formation of these active sites appears to be a key factor in catalyst performance, regardless of the bulk material's dimensionality.

5. The research shows that upon exposure to the ODHP reaction, surface oxygen concentrations increase while concentrations of non-boron elements decrease, further supporting the importance of BOx species formation.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss how understanding these properties contributes to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications, the insights into the nature of active sites and the influence of crystal structure on their formation could guide future catalyst design efforts. Understanding the relationship between crystal structure, surface boron concentration, and BOx formation could potentially be used to develop catalysts with optimized surface structures and compositions to maximize the formation of these active sites, thereby improving catalytic performance in commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research proposes that oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges act as the catalytic active sites, which are one-dimensional (1D) in nature.

The 1D edge structure of BN catalysts offers unique advantages over 0D and 2D catalysts:

1. Unlike 0D sites (e.g., V/SiO2) that tend to create highly reactive propyl radicals, the 1D edge sites in BN catalysts stabilize the propyl radical.
2. Unlike 2D sites (e.g., Cu(111) surfaces) where adsorbates can freely diffuse, the 1D nature of BN edges suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (>BOON<) at the armchair edge of BN. This structure allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals through the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate with a nitroxyl radical site.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The high reactivity and selectivity observed with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) result in enhanced propene productivity, reaching levels that are considered attractive for commercial implementation of on-purpose propene technology.

By leveraging the insights gained from studying these 1D edge active sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts that offer improved selectivity and productivity in ODHP reactions. This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design, focusing on creating materials with optimized edge structures and controlled dimensionality to achieve better performance in commercial ODHP applications, potentially leading to more economical and environmentally friendly processes for propene production.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The B2O3@BPO4 catalyst features a unique sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, where 1-D B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres. This structure maximizes the utilization of both sides of the support, which is uncommon in hollow-sphere structures.

At reaction temperatures above 450Â°C, melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as the catalytically active species. This arrangement provides a high surface area and increased accessibility of active sites, contributing to the catalyst's excellent performance in ODHP reactions.

The B2O3@BPO4 composite showed excellent activity, selectivity, and stability in ODHP reactions at 550Â°C, with a productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat-1 h-1, surpassing many metal-based catalysts. This high performance can be attributed to the unique spatial distribution and dimensionality of the active sites, particularly the 1-D B2O3 nanowires covering the 3-D BPO4 hollow spheres.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these 1-D edge active sites is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts. The sandwich-like structure and the use of melted B2O3 as an active species demonstrate a novel approach to catalyst design, combining the advantages of supported liquid-phase catalysts with the benefits of hollow sphere supports.

While the provided information doesn't explicitly discuss the reaction mechanisms of these sites, the high performance of this catalyst structure implies that the 1-D B2O3 nanowires may provide advantageous active sites for ODHP reactions. This insight could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by suggesting that incorporating 1-D structures or edge active sites in B-based catalysts might be beneficial for ODHP reactions.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study reveals that isolated BO3 units are not the active sites for ODHP, contrary to previous hypotheses. Instead, the active sites require some degree of B-O-B connectivity, suggesting that a more complex, multi-dimensional structure is necessary for catalytic activity.

The research shows that active B-based ODH catalysts form an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface during reaction conditions. This phase consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups, represented by the formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06). This structure indicates that the active sites are not limited to 1-D configurations but likely involve 2-D or 3-D arrangements of boron atoms.

The study also highlights the dynamic nature of these active sites. Under reaction conditions (500Â°C), the boron oxide phase becomes highly dynamic, undergoing restructuring. This suggests that the dimensionality of the active sites may not be static but can change during the reaction process.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. It shifts focus from isolated BO3 sites to more complex boron structures with B-O-B connectivity.
2. It emphasizes the importance of creating catalysts that can form and maintain the necessary amorphous boron oxide phase under reaction conditions.
3. It suggests that catalyst designs should consider the dynamic nature of the active sites and potentially incorporate features that promote beneficial restructuring during reactions.
4. It indicates that future catalyst development should focus on optimizing the spatial distribution and connectivity of boron sites rather than maximizing the number of isolated boron atoms.

These insights provide a foundation for developing new strategies in catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, which are 2D materials with active sites primarily located on the surface.

Key findings include:

1. Three-boron center (TBC) N-defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion.
2. There is a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC), suggesting these defects are more important for catalytic activity than g2 defects (one-boron center, OBC).
3. Aggregated boron sites are favored to become active sites, implying that the spatial distribution of these sites affects catalyst performance.
4. N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520Â°C.
5. The dimensionality of the catalyst structure impacts performance, as demonstrated by the reduced activity of O2-BN due to sintering of BN nanosheets.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Highlighting the importance of creating and maintaining TBC N-defects.
2. Emphasizing the need to prevent sintering and maintain the 2D structure of BN nanosheets.
3. Suggesting that methods to increase the concentration of edge sites, where TBC defects are more likely to form, could enhance catalytic performance.
4. Demonstrating the potential of plasma treatment as a method for selectively creating desired defect structures.

While the study does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, the emphasis on TBC defects and their evolution into active BOx species under ODH conditions suggests that edge sites, where such defects are more likely to occur, could be particularly important for catalytic activity.

The literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it provides insights into the behavior of hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

The study focuses on BNOH catalysts, which contain hydroxyl groups at the edges. These edge BOH groups play a crucial role in the catalytic process, indicating a 1-D distribution of active sites. The BNOH catalyst retains a hexagonal layered structure, suggesting a 2-D configuration with 1-D edge active sites.

The reaction mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups by O2, generating BNO* and HO2* radicals. These radicals then participate in the activation of ethane or propane and their subsequent conversion to ethylene or propylene. This understanding of the reaction pathway at the edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by highlighting the importance of edge functionalization and the role of hydroxyl groups.

The high selectivity, stability, and low CO2 formation observed in this catalyst system suggest that understanding and optimizing the 1-D edge active sites could lead to improved catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. To design more efficient catalysts, researchers could focus on:

1. Maximizing the number of edge sites in boron nitride-based materials
2. Optimizing the hydroxylation process to increase the density of active BOH groups
3. Exploring other edge functionalization strategies that might enhance catalytic performance
4. Investigating the stability and regeneration of edge active sites under reaction conditions

These approaches, based on the understanding of 1-D edge active sites in 2-D materials, could contribute to the development of more effective and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions and related oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research focuses on the importance of 1-D edge active sites, especially N-terminated edges, in enhancing catalytic activity.

Key findings include:

1. Defective edges in h-BN function as catalytically active sites, similar to those in graphene.
2. N-terminated edges are particularly effective for oxygen activation, crucial for oxidation reactions.
3. Creating porous structures with high specific surface areas (up to 1579 m2/g) exposes more active sites, enhancing overall catalytic performance.
4. The spatial distribution of active sites is optimized by generating abundant N-terminated edges around pores.
5. The dimensionality of active sites is primarily 1-D, focusing on edge sites rather than planar or 3-D structures.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by:

1. Increasing the density and accessibility of active sites through porous structures.
2. Tailoring edge termination to optimize catalytic properties.
3. Developing targeted synthesis methods, such as using Zn templates, to create catalysts with optimized active site distributions.
4. Providing insights into structure-activity relationships, allowing for more rational catalyst design.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on ODHP reactions, the principles of tailoring edge sites and understanding their role in oxygen activation could potentially be applied to designing more efficient catalysts for ODHP and other oxidation reactions in commercial applications.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) demonstrates superior activity and selectivity compared to traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of h-BN, particularly its 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in its performance:

          1. Edge active sites: The edge BOH groups are key in the reaction mechanism, being dehydrogenated by O2 to generate BO and HO2 radicals. These radicals facilitate hydrogen abstraction from alkanes, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

          2. Thermal conductivity: The superior thermal conductivity of h-BN helps avoid hotspots during the reaction, leading to better control and improved selectivity. This is a significant advantage over traditional catalysts like VOx/Î³-Al2O3.

          3. Spatial distribution: The uniform dispersion of h-BN over monolithic catalysts contributes to its high performance. The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, enhancing propane conversion compared to h-BN powder.

          Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of 1-D edge active sites and the benefits of 2-D and 3-D structures, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the exposure and density of edge sites, channel structures, and thermal properties, researchers can potentially enhance the catalytic performance and selectivity towards desired products.
