          [1] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[2] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[3] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

          The provided literature does not directly address the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. However, it does mention the use of boron nitride (BN) materials with specific structural features for this application.

The document describes a BN-based monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure. This structure provides a large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space, which are beneficial for catalysis. The foam consists of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This unique arrangement likely influences the spatial distribution of active sites.

The literature reports that pure h-BN monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure, prepared at higher temperatures, possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This foam demonstrates excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The hierarchical porous structure may contribute to the efficient distribution of active sites and facilitate the ODHP reaction.

While the document does not specifically discuss the dimensionality of active sites or the unique properties of 1-D edge active sites, it does highlight the importance of structural design in creating efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions. The oriented bowl-like structure and hierarchical porosity of the BN-based foam appear to play crucial roles in its catalytic performance.

          提供的文献并没有直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应性能的影响。然而，它确实提到了具有特定结构特征的氮化硼(BN)材料在这一应用中的使用。

文件描述了一种具有定向碗状结构的BN基单体泡沫。这种结构提供了大的表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空心空间，这些对催化反应有利。泡沫由许多定向的碗状块组成，排列成面对面开口的双层结构。这种独特的排列可能会影响活性位点的空间分布。

文献报道，在较高温度下制备的具有定向碗状结构的纯h-BN单体泡沫具有多模态的层级多孔结构。这种泡沫在丙烷催化氧化脱氢制丙烯方面表现出优异的性能。层级多孔结构可能有助于活性位点的有效分布，并促进ODHP反应。

虽然文件没有具体讨论活性位点的维度或一维边缘活性位点的独特性质，但它确实强调了结构设计在创造高效ODHP反应催化剂中的重要性。BN基泡沫的定向碗状结构和层级多孔性似乎在其催化性能中起着关键作用。
