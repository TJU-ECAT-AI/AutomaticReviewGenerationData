          [1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "This is drastically different from a 0D site (e.g., V/SiO2), which most likely creates a reactive propyl radical (34), or a 2D site [e.g., Cu(111) surface] where diffusion of adsorbates is unrestricted (35), both prone to overoxidation."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[5] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1) (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research proposes that oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges act as the catalytic active sites, which are one-dimensional (1D) in nature.

The 1D edge structure of BN catalysts offers unique advantages over 0D and 2D catalysts:

1. Unlike 0D sites (e.g., V/SiO2) that tend to create highly reactive propyl radicals, the 1D edge sites in BN catalysts stabilize the propyl radical.
2. Unlike 2D sites (e.g., Cu(111) surfaces) where adsorbates can freely diffuse, the 1D nature of BN edges suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (>BOON<) at the armchair edge of BN. This structure allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals through the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate with a nitroxyl radical site.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The high reactivity and selectivity observed with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) result in enhanced propene productivity, reaching levels that are considered attractive for commercial implementation of on-purpose propene technology.

By leveraging the insights gained from studying these 1D edge active sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts that offer improved selectivity and productivity in ODHP reactions. This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design, focusing on creating materials with optimized edge structures and controlled dimensionality to achieve better performance in commercial ODHP applications, potentially leading to more economical and environmentally friendly processes for propene production.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。研究提出，氮化硼（BN）材料中的催化活性位点是氧端接的扶手椅边缘，这些边缘是一维（1D）的。

BN催化剂的这种1D边缘结构比0D和2D催化剂具有独特的优势：

1. 与倾向于产生高活性丙基自由基的0D位点（如V/SiO2催化剂）不同，BN催化剂中的1D边缘位点能够稳定丙基自由基。
2. 与吸附物可自由扩散的2D位点（如Cu(111)表面）不同，BN边缘的1D特性抑制了吸附物的过度氧化。

ODHP反应的提议活性位点是一个与BN扶手椅边缘的一个硼原子和一个氮原子结合的氧分子（>BOON<）。这种结构通过与亚硝基自由基位点形成表面稳定的丙基中间体，实现了丙基自由基的稳定。

理解这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂至关重要。硼氮纳米管（BNNTs）表现出的高反应活性和选择性导致丙烯生产率显著提高，达到了被认为适合商业化实施定向丙烯技术的水平。

通过利用对这些1D边缘活性位点的研究所获得的见解，研究人员可能开发出在ODHP反应中提供更好选择性和生产率的催化剂。这种理解为催化剂设计开辟了新途径，聚焦于创造具有优化边缘结构和受控维度的材料，以在商业ODHP应用中实现更好的性能，潜在地导致更经济、更环保的丙烯生产工艺。
