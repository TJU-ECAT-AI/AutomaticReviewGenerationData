[1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "This is drastically different from a 0D site (e.g., V/SiO2), which most likely creates a reactive propyl radical (34), or a 2D site [e.g., Cu(111) surface] where diffusion of adsorbates is unrestricted (35), both prone to overoxidation."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research highlights the unique properties of 1-D edge active sites in boron nitride (BN) catalysts, specifically oxygen-terminated armchair edges.

These 1-D edge sites offer several advantages over 0-D and 2-D sites. Unlike 0-D sites (such as those in V/SiO2 catalysts) which tend to create highly reactive propyl radicals, or 2-D sites (like Cu(111) surfaces) where adsorbates can diffuse freely, the 1-D nature of the BN edge sites allows for better control of the reaction intermediates.

The key feature of these 1-D edge sites is their ability to stabilize the propyl radical by forming a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate. This stabilization prevents the creation of highly reactive species that are prone to overoxidation, which is a common issue with 0-D and 2-D catalysts. As a result, the BN catalysts exhibit high selectivity towards desired olefin products.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom at the armchair edge of BN (>BOON<). This structure acts as an inorganic peroxide species capable of performing oxidation reactions efficiently.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1-D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By leveraging the stabilizing effects of these sites, it becomes possible to develop catalysts that offer high selectivity towards desired products while minimizing unwanted overoxidation. This could lead to more efficient and economically viable processes for on-purpose propene production, addressing the growing demand-supply gap in the chemical industry.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的性能有显著影响。研究强调了氮化硼（BN）催化剂中一维边缘活性位点的独特性质，特别是氧化物终止的扶手边缘。

这些一维边缘位点比零维和二维位点具有几个优势。与倾向于产生高活性丙基自由基的零维位点（如V/SiO2催化剂中的位点）或吸附物可以自由扩散的二维位点（如Cu(111)表面）不同，BN边缘位点的一维性质允许更好地控制反应中间体。

这些一维边缘位点的关键特征是它们能够通过形成表面稳定的丙基中间体来稳定丙基自由基。这种稳定作用防止了容易过度氧化的高活性物种的产生，这是零维和二维催化剂常见的问题。因此，BN催化剂对目标烯烃产物表现出高选择性。

ODHP反应的proposed活性位点是在BN扶手边缘上与一个硼原子和一个氮原子结合的氧分子（>BOON<）。这种结构作为无机过氧化物种，能够高效地进行氧化反应。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂贡献重大。通过利用这些位点的稳定效应，有可能开发出对目标产物具有高选择性同时最小化不必要过度氧化的催化剂。这可能导致更高效和经济可行的定向丙烯生产过程，解决化工行业日益增长的供需差距。
