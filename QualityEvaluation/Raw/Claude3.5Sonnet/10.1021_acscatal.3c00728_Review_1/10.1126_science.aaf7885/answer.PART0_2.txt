[1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "This is drastically different from a 0D site (e.g., V/SiO2), which most likely creates a reactive propyl radical (34), or a 2D site [e.g., Cu(111) surface] where diffusion of adsorbates is unrestricted (35), both prone to overoxidation."

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The study proposes that the catalytic active sites in boron nitride (BN) materials are oxygen-terminated armchair edges, which are one-dimensional (1D) in nature.

This 1D edge structure of BN catalysts offers unique advantages over 0D and 2D catalysts. Unlike 0D sites (such as those in V/SiO2 catalysts) that tend to create highly reactive propyl radicals, or 2D sites (like Cu(111) surfaces) where adsorbates can freely diffuse, the 1D edge sites in BN catalysts stabilize the propyl radical. This stabilization is achieved through the formation of a surface-stabilized propyl intermediate with a nitroxyl radical.

The 1D nature of these edge sites prevents the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of 0D catalysts and suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species common in 2D catalysts. This unique property contributes to the high olefin selectivity observed in BN catalysts.

Understanding these 1D edge active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The proposed mechanism involves an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N atom (>BOON<) at the armchair edge of BN, acting as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This insight into the structure-function relationship of BN catalysts can guide the development of new catalysts with improved selectivity and efficiency for ODHP reactions, potentially leading to more economical and environmentally friendly processes for propene production.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的性能有显著影响。研究提出，氮化硼(BN)材料中的催化活性位点是氧端接的扶手椅边缘，这些边缘是一维(1D)的。

BN催化剂的这种1D边缘结构比0D和2D催化剂具有独特的优势。与倾向于产生高活性丙基自由基的0D位点（如V/SiO2催化剂中的位点）或吸附物可自由扩散的2D位点（如Cu(111)表面）不同，BN催化剂中的1D边缘位点能够稳定丙基自由基。这种稳定性是通过与亚硝基自由基形成表面稳定的丙基中间体实现的。

这些边缘位点的1D特性防止了0D催化剂典型的高活性丙基自由基的产生，并抑制了2D催化剂常见的吸附物过度氧化。这一独特性质促成了BN催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性。

理解这些1D边缘活性位点及其反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂至关重要。提出的机理涉及一个氧分子与BN扶手椅边缘的一个B原子和一个N原子结合(>BOON<)，作为ODHP反应的活性位点。这种对BN催化剂结构-功能关系的洞察可以指导开发具有更高选择性和效率的ODHP反应新催化剂，潜在地导致更经济、更环保的丙烯生产工艺。
