[1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[3] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1) (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The study proposes that oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges act as the catalytic active sites, which are one-dimensional (1D) in nature. This 1D characteristic of the edge sites contributes to the high olefin selectivity observed in the reaction.

The unique properties of these 1D edge active sites allow for the stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites. This stabilization avoids the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals, which are typically associated with 0D single-site catalysts. Additionally, the 1D nature of the sites suppresses the overoxidation of adsorbed species, which is a common issue with 2D surface catalysts.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. The high reactivity and selectivity observed with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) result in enhanced propene productivity, reaching levels that are considered attractive for commercial implementation of on-purpose propene technology.

By leveraging the insights gained from studying these 1D edge active sites, researchers can potentially develop catalysts that offer improved selectivity and productivity in ODHP reactions. This understanding opens up new avenues for catalyst design, focusing on creating materials with optimized edge structures and controlled dimensionality to achieve better performance in commercial ODHP applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。研究提出，氧化末端的扶手椅型氮化硼边缘充当催化活性位点，这些位点具有一维(1D)特性。边缘位点的这种一维特性有助于反应中观察到的高烯烃选择性。

这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质允许亚硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基。这种稳定作用避免了高反应活性丙基自由基的产生，而这种自由基通常与零维单点催化剂相关。此外，位点的一维特性抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化，这是二维表面催化剂常见的问题。

理解这些一维边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂贡献重大。氮化硼纳米管(BNNTs)表现出的高反应活性和选择性导致丙烯生产率显著提高，达到了被认为适合商业化实施定向丙烯技术的水平。

通过利用对这些一维边缘活性位点的研究所获得的见解，研究人员可能开发出在ODHP反应中提供更好选择性和生产率的催化剂。这种理解为催化剂设计开辟了新途径，聚焦于创造具有优化边缘结构和受控维度的材料，以在商业ODHP应用中实现更好的性能。
