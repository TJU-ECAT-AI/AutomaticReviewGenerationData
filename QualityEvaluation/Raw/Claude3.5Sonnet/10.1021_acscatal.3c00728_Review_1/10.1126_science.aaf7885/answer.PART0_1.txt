[1] "We put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair boron nitride edges are proposed to be the catalytic active sites."

[2] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1) (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology"

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[4] "Starting from our modeled active site (namely, >BOON<), we then calculated key intermediates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >BOON< sites, breaking the OO bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl radical"

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research highlights the unique properties of one-dimensional (1D) edge active sites in boron nitride (BN) materials, specifically oxygen-terminated armchair edges.

These 1D edge sites offer several advantages over 0D (single-site) and 2D (surface) catalysts. The 1D nature of the edge allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites, which is key to achieving high olefin selectivity. This stabilization mechanism avoids the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of 0D catalysts and prevents the overoxidation of adsorbed species often seen with 2D surface catalysts.

The proposed active site structure (>BOON<) on the BN edge initiates the dehydrogenation process by abstracting a hydrogen atom from propane, forming intermediates that favor the production of propene. This unique reaction mechanism contributes to the high selectivity and productivity observed in BN-based catalysts, particularly in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs).

Understanding these 1D edge active sites and their reaction mechanisms is crucial for designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. The enhanced propene productivity achieved with BNNTs, comparable to values considered attractive for commercial implementation, demonstrates the potential of this approach in developing on-purpose propene production technologies.

By focusing on the creation and optimization of these 1D edge sites in B-based catalysts, researchers can work towards developing more selective and efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially revolutionizing propene production in the chemical industry.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂活性位点的空间分布和维度对其性能有显著影响。研究强调了硼氮（BN）材料中一维（1D）边缘活性位点的独特性质，特别是氧化终止的扶手椅边缘。

这些1D边缘位点相比0D（单点）和2D（表面）催化剂具有几个优势。边缘的1D特性允许通过亚硝基自由基位点稳定丙基自由基，这是实现高烯烃选择性的关键。这种稳定机制避免了0D催化剂典型的高反应性丙基自由基的产生，并防止了2D表面催化剂常见的吸附物种过度氧化。

BN边缘上提出的活性位点结构（>BOON<）通过从丙烷中提取氢原子来启动脱氢过程，形成有利于丙烯生产的中间体。这种独特的反应机制有助于在BN基催化剂中观察到的高选择性和生产力，特别是在硼氮纳米管（BNNTs）中。

理解这些1D边缘活性位点及其反应机制对于设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂至关重要。BNNTs实现的增强丙烯生产力与被认为具有商业实施吸引力的值相当，展示了这种方法在开发定向丙烯生产技术方面的潜力。

通过关注B基催化剂中这些1D边缘位点的创建和优化，研究人员可以致力于开发更具选择性和效率的ODHP反应催化剂，潜在地革新化学工业中的丙烯生产。
