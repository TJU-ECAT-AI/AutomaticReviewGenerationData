[1] "We propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[2] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

[3] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1) (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this on-purpose propene technology (15, 21)."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions. The research suggests that the one-dimensional (1D) nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge of boron nitride (BN) plays a crucial role in achieving high olefin selectivity. This 1D edge structure provides a unique balance, avoiding the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals typical of zero-dimensional (0D) single-site catalysts while also suppressing the overoxidation of adsorbed species common in two-dimensional (2D) surface catalysts.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom at the armchair edge of BN. This specific configuration allows for the stabilization of propyl radicals, leading to improved selectivity towards desired olefin products. Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of 1D edge active sites contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications.

The high reactivity and selectivity observed with boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), which feature these 1D edge sites, result in substantially enhanced propene productivity. This improvement in performance brings the catalyst to levels considered attractive for commercial implementation of on-purpose propene technology. By leveraging the unique spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts, researchers can potentially develop more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions, addressing the growing demand for propene in the chemical industry.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中，B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对其性能有显著影响。研究表明，氮化硼（BN）的氧化扶手边缘的一维（1D）性质在获得高烯烃选择性方面起着关键作用。这种1D边缘结构提供了独特的平衡，避免了零维（0D）单点催化剂典型的高反应性丙基自由基的产生，同时也抑制了二维（2D）表面催化剂常见的吸附物种过度氧化。

ODHP反应的proposed活性位点是一个与BN扶手边缘上一个硼原子和一个氮原子结合的氧分子。这种特定构型允许稳定丙基自由基，从而提高了对所需烯烃产物的选择性。理解这些1D边缘活性位点的独特性质和反应机理，对设计更高效的商业应用催化剂做出了重大贡献。

具有这些1D边缘位点的氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）表现出高反应性和选择性，显著提高了丙烯的生产率。这种性能的提升使该催化剂达到了被认为适合商业化实施定向丙烯技术的水平。通过利用B基催化剂中活性位点的独特空间分布和维度，研究人员有可能开发出更高效、更具选择性的ODHP反应催化剂，满足化工行业日益增长的丙烯需求。
