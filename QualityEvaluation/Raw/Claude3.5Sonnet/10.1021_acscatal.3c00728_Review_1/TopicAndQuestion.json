    "QuestionEnglish": "How do the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, and how does understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites, contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications?",
    "QuestionChinese": "B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（一维、二维和三维）如何影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的性能，理解这些位点（尤其是一维边缘活性位点）的独特性质和反应机理如何有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂？"
