The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature discusses several types of boron species with different spatial arrangements:

1. Aggregated boron species embedded in zeolites (MWW and MFI types) show high efficiency in activating propane.

2. Isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.

3. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

The unique properties of these sites, particularly the 1-D edge active sites (like the isolated boron sites), contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts by:

1. Improving accessibility of active sites through exposed small unit cells and extra-large micropores.

2. Enhancing mass transfer efficiency.

3. Enabling both surface-catalyzed and gas-phase reactions, which are crucial for high performance in ODHP reactions.

4. Providing durability through stable structures like the B[OHO(H)Si]2.

5. Facilitating synergistic conversion of reactants through hydrogen bonding.

Understanding these mechanisms allows researchers to design catalysts with optimized spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, leading to improved efficiency and selectivity in commercial ODHP applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献讨论了几种具有不同空间排列的硼物种：

1. 嵌入沸石（MWW和MFI类型）中的聚集硼物种在活化丙烷方面表现出高效率。

2. 硼硅沸石中具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼位点表现出耐久性，并通过氢键实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

3. 缺陷三配位硼物种中的氢键BOH基团负责在催化剂表面和气相中活化丙烷。

这些位点的独特性质，特别是一维边缘活性位点（如孤立硼位点），通过以下方式为设计更高效的催化剂做出贡献：

1. 通过暴露的小单元格和超大微孔提高活性位点的可及性。

2. 提高质量传递效率。

3. 实现表面催化和气相反应，这对ODHP反应的高性能至关重要。

4. 通过稳定结构（如B[OHO(H)Si]2）提供耐久性。

5. 通过氢键促进反应物的协同转化。

了解这些机制使研究人员能够设计具有优化空间分布和活性位点维度的催化剂，从而在商业ODHP应用中提高效率和选择性。
