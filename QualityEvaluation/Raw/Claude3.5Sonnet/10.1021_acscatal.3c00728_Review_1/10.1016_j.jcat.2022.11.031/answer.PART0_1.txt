The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature discusses several types of boron sites:

1. Aggregated boron species in MWW- and MFI-type zeolites, which are efficient in activating propane.

2. Isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites, which enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.

3. Defect-rich zeolitic structures with abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contribute to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers.

The dimensionality of these sites affects their accessibility and reactivity. For example, the extra-large micropores in embryonic zeolitic materials improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites. This enhanced accessibility likely contributes to better catalytic performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites (though not explicitly mentioned in the given text), can contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts by:

1. Optimizing the distribution of active sites to maximize their exposure and accessibility.
2. Engineering the local environment of boron sites to enhance their stability and activity.
3. Tailoring the pore structure to facilitate mass transfer and optimize the balance between surface reactions and gas-phase reactions.

These insights can guide the development of catalysts with improved propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates, potentially leading to more efficient commercial ODHP processes.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献讨论了几种类型的硼位点：

1. MWW和MFI型沸石中的聚集硼物种，它们在活化丙烷方面非常高效。

2. 硼硅酸盐沸石中具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼位点，通过氢键实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

3. 具有丰富SiOH和BOH基团的缺陷丰富的沸石结构，有助于稳定硼物种并构建活性硼中心。

这些位点的维度影响了它们的可及性和反应性。例如，胚胎沸石材料中的超大微孔提高了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。这种增强的可及性可能会提高催化性能。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理，特别是一维边缘活性位点（尽管在给定文本中没有明确提到），可以通过以下方式为设计更高效的催化剂做出贡献：

1. 优化活性位点的分布，以最大化其暴露和可及性。
2. 调整硼位点的局部环境，以提高其稳定性和活性。
3. 调整孔结构，以促进质量传递并优化表面反应和气相反应之间的平衡。

这些见解可以指导开发具有更高丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率的催化剂，潜在地提高商业ODHP过程的效率。
