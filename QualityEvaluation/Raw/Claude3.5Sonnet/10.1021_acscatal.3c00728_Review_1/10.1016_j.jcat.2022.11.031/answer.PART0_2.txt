[1] "Boron-based catalysts have received significant attention for their inhibition of deep oxidation of olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process for the production of propylene"

[2] "Recently, boron-containing zeolite catalysts with diversity and adjustability crystal structures are capable of catalyzing ODHP reaction and provide a unique perspective to understand the reaction process and further develop highly active and selective catalysts"

[3] "The isolated boron site with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite showed durability in long period test and enabled the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through three hydrogen bonds on the boron site"

[4] "For hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) and B2O3-based catalysts, it is gradually recognized that, in addition to surface-catalyzed pathway, gas-phase radical reactions are also the important issue during the ODHP process, which could influence the overall catalytic activity"

[5] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size. The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Different structures of boron-containing catalysts, such as zeolites, h-BN, and B2O3, offer unique properties that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

1D edge active sites, particularly in boron-containing zeolites, play a crucial role in ODHP reactions. The isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate high durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding. This structure provides a unique reaction mechanism that contributes to improved catalyst performance.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: Boron-based catalysts inhibit deep oxidation of olefins, leading to higher propylene selectivity.

2. Enhanced durability: Isolated boron sites in zeolites show long-term stability, which is crucial for commercial applications.

3. Optimized porosity: Embryonic zeolitic materials with extra-large microporosity improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites, potentially enhancing catalytic performance.

4. Balanced reaction pathways: Understanding the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase radical reactions allows for the design of catalysts that optimize both pathways for improved overall activity.

By leveraging these insights, researchers can develop B-based catalysts with tailored spatial distributions and dimensionalities of active sites, leading to more efficient and selective ODHP catalysts for commercial use.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。含硼催化剂的不同结构,如沸石、h-BN和B2O3,提供了影响催化活性和选择性的独特性质。

一维边缘活性位点,特别是在含硼沸石中,在ODHP反应中起着至关重要的作用。硼硅酸盐沸石中具有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼位点表现出高耐久性,并通过氢键实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。这种结构提供了一种独特的反应机制,有助于提高催化剂性能。

理解这些位点的性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的商业应用催化剂,主要体现在以下几个方面:

1. 提高选择性:硼基催化剂抑制烯烃的深度氧化,从而提高丙烯选择性。

2. 增强耐久性:沸石中的孤立硼位点表现出长期稳定性,这对商业应用至关重要。

3. 优化孔隙度:具有超大微孔的胚胎沸石材料改善了质量传递和活性位点的可及性,可能增强催化性能。

4. 平衡反应途径:了解表面催化和气相自由基反应之间的相互作用,可以设计出优化这两种途径的催化剂,从而提高整体活性。

通过利用这些见解,研究人员可以开发具有定制空间分布和维度活性位点的B基催化剂,从而开发出更高效、更具选择性的商用ODHP催化剂。
