The literature does not directly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the influence of active site structure on catalyst performance.

The document mentions that isolated boron sites with a specific structure (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate zeolites show good durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of these sites is important for their catalytic activity.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalysts described in the study have a defect-rich structure with extra-large micropores, which improves mass transfer and accessibility of active sites. This indicates that the three-dimensional arrangement of pores and active sites plays a role in catalyst efficiency.

The study identifies H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species as responsible for activating propane both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific structure and bonding environment of active sites.

While the document does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, the emphasis on isolated boron sites and their specific bonding environments suggests that understanding such unique properties could indeed contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. The study's focus on the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase reactions also indicates that optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites could be crucial for improving catalyst performance.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度（1-D、2-D和3-D）对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应性能的影响。然而，它确实提供了一些关于活性位点结构对催化剂性能影响的见解。

文档提到，硼硅分子筛中具有特定结构（B[OHO(H)Si]2）的孤立硼位点表现出良好的耐久性，并能实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。这表明这些位点的空间排列对其催化活性很重要。

研究中描述的胚胎硼硅分子筛（EBZ）催化剂具有富含缺陷的结构和超大微孔，这改善了物质传递和活性位点的可及性。这表明孔和活性位点的三维排列对催化剂效率起着作用。

该研究确定缺陷三配位硼物种中的氢键BOH基团负责在催化剂表面和气相中活化丙烷。这突出了理解活性位点的特定结构和键合环境的重要性。

虽然该文档没有明确讨论一维边缘活性位点，但对孤立硼位点及其特定键合环境的强调表明，理解这些独特的性质确实可以有助于设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂。该研究对表面催化反应和气相反应之间相互作用的关注也表明，优化活性位点的空间分布对于提高催化剂性能可能至关重要。

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature discusses several types of boron sites:

1. Aggregated boron species in MWW- and MFI-type zeolites, which are efficient in activating propane.

2. Isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites, which enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.

3. Defect-rich zeolitic structures with abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contribute to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers.

The dimensionality of these sites affects their accessibility and reactivity. For example, the extra-large micropores in embryonic zeolitic materials improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites. This enhanced accessibility likely contributes to better catalytic performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites, particularly 1-D edge active sites (though not explicitly mentioned in the given text), can contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts by:

1. Optimizing the distribution of active sites to maximize their exposure and accessibility.
2. Engineering the local environment of boron sites to enhance their stability and activity.
3. Tailoring the pore structure to facilitate mass transfer and optimize the balance between surface reactions and gas-phase reactions.

These insights can guide the development of catalysts with improved propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates, potentially leading to more efficient commercial ODHP processes.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Different structures of boron-containing catalysts, such as zeolites, h-BN, and B2O3, offer unique properties that affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

1D edge active sites, particularly in boron-containing zeolites, play a crucial role in ODHP reactions. The isolated boron sites with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate high durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding. This structure provides a unique reaction mechanism that contributes to improved catalyst performance.

Understanding the properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: Boron-based catalysts inhibit deep oxidation of olefins, leading to higher propylene selectivity.

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature discusses various forms of boron-based catalysts, including aggregated boron species in zeolites, isolated boron sites in borosilicate zeolites, and hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) catalysts, each with different spatial distributions of active sites.

1D edge active sites are not specifically mentioned in the given literature. However, the text discusses the importance of exposed active sites and their accessibility. The embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalyst, with its defect-rich structure and developed large porosity, provides abundant exposure of active boron centers. This increased accessibility of active sites leads to improved catalytic performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by:

1. Optimizing the distribution of active sites: The literature suggests that isolated boron sites with specific structures (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate zeolites show durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

2. Enhancing gas-phase reactions: The recognition that gas-phase radical reactions play an important role in the ODHP process, particularly for h-BN and B2O3-based catalysts, has led to strategies for improving catalytic activity by enhancing these reactions.

3. Improving mass transfer and accessibility: The development of catalysts with extra-large micropores and exposed small unit cells, as seen in the embryonic zeolitic materials, improves the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Balancing surface-catalyzed and gas-phase reactions: Understanding the contribution of both surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase reactions allows for the design of catalysts that optimize both processes for improved overall performance.
