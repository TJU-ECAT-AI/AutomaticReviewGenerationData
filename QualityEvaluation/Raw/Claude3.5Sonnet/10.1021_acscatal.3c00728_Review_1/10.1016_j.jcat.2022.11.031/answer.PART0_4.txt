The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature discusses various forms of boron-based catalysts, including aggregated boron species in zeolites, isolated boron sites in borosilicate zeolites, and hexagonal boron nitride-based (h-BN) catalysts, each with different spatial distributions of active sites.

1D edge active sites are not specifically mentioned in the given literature. However, the text discusses the importance of exposed active sites and their accessibility. The embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalyst, with its defect-rich structure and developed large porosity, provides abundant exposure of active boron centers. This increased accessibility of active sites leads to improved catalytic performance.

Understanding the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of these sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts by:

1. Optimizing the distribution of active sites: The literature suggests that isolated boron sites with specific structures (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate zeolites show durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane.

2. Enhancing gas-phase reactions: The recognition that gas-phase radical reactions play an important role in the ODHP process, particularly for h-BN and B2O3-based catalysts, has led to strategies for improving catalytic activity by enhancing these reactions.

3. Improving mass transfer and accessibility: The development of catalysts with extra-large micropores and exposed small unit cells, as seen in the embryonic zeolitic materials, improves the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Balancing surface-catalyzed and gas-phase reactions: Understanding the contribution of both surface-catalyzed pathways and gas-phase reactions allows for the design of catalysts that optimize both processes for improved overall performance.

By focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient B-based catalysts for commercial ODHP applications, potentially leading to higher propylene yields and improved process economics.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献讨论了各种形式的硼基催化剂，包括沸石中的聚集硼物种、硼硅酸盐沸石中的孤立硼位点以及六方氮化硼（h-BN）基催化剂，每种催化剂都有不同的活性位点空间分布。

文献中没有具体提到一维边缘活性位点。然而，文本讨论了暴露的活性位点及其可及性的重要性。胚胎型硼硅酸盐沸石（EBZ）催化剂由于其缺陷丰富的结构和发达的大孔隙度，提供了大量暴露的活性硼中心。这种增加的活性位点可及性导致了催化性能的提高。

理解这些位点的独特性质和反应机理有助于设计更高效的催化剂，具体方法如下：

1. 优化活性位点的分布：文献表明，硼硅酸盐沸石中具有特定结构（B[OHO(H)Si]2）的孤立硼位点显示出耐久性，并能实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

2. 增强气相反应：认识到气相自由基反应在ODHP过程中起重要作用，特别是对于h-BN和B2O3基催化剂，已经导致了通过增强这些反应来提高催化活性的策略。

3. 改善质量传递和可及性：开发具有超大微孔和暴露的小单元的催化剂，如胚胎型沸石材料，提高了质量传递效率和活性位点的可及性。

4. 平衡表面催化和气相反应：理解表面催化途径和气相反应的贡献，允许设计能够优化这两个过程的催化剂，从而提高整体性能。

通过关注这些方面，研究人员可以开发出更高效的B基催化剂用于商业ODHP应用，潜在地导致更高的丙烯产率和改善的工艺经济性。
