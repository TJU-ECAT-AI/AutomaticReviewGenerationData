The literature does not directly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D) of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the influence of active site structure on catalyst performance.

The document mentions that isolated boron sites with a specific structure (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate zeolites show good durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of these sites is important for their catalytic activity.

The embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) catalysts described in the study have a defect-rich structure with extra-large micropores, which improves mass transfer and accessibility of active sites. This indicates that the three-dimensional arrangement of pores and active sites plays a role in catalyst efficiency.

The study identifies H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species as responsible for activating propane both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific structure and bonding environment of active sites.

While the document does not explicitly discuss 1-D edge active sites, the emphasis on isolated boron sites and their specific bonding environments suggests that understanding such unique properties could indeed contribute to designing more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. The study's focus on the interplay between surface-catalyzed and gas-phase reactions also indicates that optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites could be crucial for improving catalyst performance.
