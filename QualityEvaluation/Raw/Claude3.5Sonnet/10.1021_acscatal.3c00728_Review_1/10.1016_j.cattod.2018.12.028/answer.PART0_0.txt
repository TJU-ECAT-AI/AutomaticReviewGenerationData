[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

[2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

[3] "We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

The literature does not directly address how the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts influence their performance in ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the unique properties and reaction mechanisms of h-BN catalysts.

The document mentions that h-BN demonstrates impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP compared to traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. This superior performance is attributed to two main factors:

1. Thermal conductivity: h-BN's excellent thermal conductivity helps avoid hotspots during the reaction, which can lead to better control of the reaction and improved selectivity.

2. Edge active sites: The literature suggests that edge BOH groups play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These edge sites can be dehydrogenated by O2 to generate BO and HO2 radicals, which then participate in the dehydrogenation of the alkane.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites, it implies that the 1-D edge sites of h-BN are particularly important for its catalytic activity. Understanding the role of these edge sites and their unique properties could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications by focusing on maximizing the exposure of these active sites and optimizing their reactivity.

该文献并未直接讨论B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度如何影响其在ODHP反应中的性能。但是，它确实提供了一些关于h-BN催化剂独特性质和反应机理的见解。

文献提到，与传统的钒氧化物催化剂相比，h-BN在ODHP反应中表现出令人印象深刻的活性和选择性。这种优异的性能主要归因于两个因素：

1. 热导率：h-BN优秀的热导率有助于避免反应过程中的热点产生，这可以更好地控制反应并提高选择性。

2. 边缘活性位点：文献表明，边缘BOH基团在反应机理中起着关键作用。这些边缘位点可以被O2脱氢生成BO和HO2自由基，然后参与烷烃的脱氢过程。

虽然文档没有明确讨论活性位点的空间分布和维度，但它暗示h-BN的一维边缘位点对其催化活性特别重要。理解这些边缘位点的作用及其独特性质，可以通过关注最大化这些活性位点的暴露和优化其反应活性，为设计更高效的商业应用催化剂做出贡献。
