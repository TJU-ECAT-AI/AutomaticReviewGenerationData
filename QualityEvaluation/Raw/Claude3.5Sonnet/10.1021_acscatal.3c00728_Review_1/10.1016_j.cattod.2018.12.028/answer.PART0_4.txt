[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

[2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

[3] "The EDS mapping of boron and nitrogen showed a highly and uniformly dispersed h-BN over the monolithic catalyst"

[4] "We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature highlights that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) demonstrates impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, surpassing traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The uniform dispersion of h-BN over the monolithic catalyst contributes to its high performance.

The unique properties of B-based catalysts, particularly the 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. The edge BOH groups are involved in the dehydrogenation process, generating BO and HO2 radicals that facilitate the hydrogen abstraction from alkanes. This understanding of the reaction mechanism at the edge sites contributes to the design of more efficient catalysts.

Furthermore, the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN helps avoid hotspots in the catalyst bed, which is a significant advantage over traditional catalysts like VOx/γ-Al2O3. This property allows for better heat management during the highly exothermic ODHP reaction, potentially leading to improved selectivity and stability in commercial applications.

By understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms, researchers can design B-based catalysts with optimized spatial distribution of active sites, focusing on maximizing the availability of edge sites while maintaining excellent heat conductivity. This approach could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for commercial ODHP applications.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献强调，六方氮化硼(h-BN)在ODHP中表现出令人印象深刻的活性和选择性，超过了传统的钒氧化物催化剂。h-BN在整体催化剂上的均匀分散有助于其高性能表现。

B基催化剂的独特性质，特别是一维边缘活性位点，在反应机理中发挥着关键作用。边缘BOH基团参与脱氢过程，产生BO和HO2自由基，促进烷烃的氢提取。对边缘位点反应机理的理解有助于设计更高效的催化剂。

此外，h-BN优异的热传导性有助于避免催化剂床层中的热点形成，这是相对于传统催化剂如VOx/γ-Al2O3的一个重要优势。这一特性允许在高度放热的ODHP反应中更好地管理热量，可能导致商业应用中选择性和稳定性的提高。

通过理解这些独特的性质和反应机理，研究人员可以设计具有优化空间分布活性位点的B基催化剂，重点是最大化边缘位点的可用性，同时保持优异的热传导性。这种方法可能导致开发出更高效、更稳定的商业ODHP应用催化剂。
