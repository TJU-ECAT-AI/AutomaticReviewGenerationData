[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

[2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

[3] "the hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generates the B-O-O-B intermediates, which further abstracting the hydrogen atoms from alkane, as reported in the previous work"

[4] "we proposed that the gas phase free radical reactions play important roles in oxidative of ethane over h-BN. We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals."

The literature does not directly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the properties and reaction mechanisms of h-BN catalysts that can be related to this topic.

The high activity and selectivity of h-BN for ODHP compared to traditional vanadium oxide catalysts suggest that the unique properties of h-BN contribute to its superior performance. The superior thermal conductivity of h-BN helps avoid hotspots during the reaction, which is beneficial for controlling the reaction and preventing over-oxidation.

The reaction mechanism involves the edge BOH groups of h-BN, which suggests that 1-D edge active sites play a crucial role in the catalytic process. These edge sites participate in hydrogen abstraction and the formation of B-O-O-B intermediates, which are key steps in the ODHP reaction.

The involvement of gas phase free radical reactions, initiated by the dehydrogenation of edge BOH groups, further emphasizes the importance of these 1-D edge sites in the overall reaction mechanism. The generation of BO and HO2 radicals from these edge sites contributes to the dehydrogenation process both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of h-BN, particularly the role of 1-D edge active sites, can contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the exposure and density of these edge sites, it may be possible to enhance the catalytic performance and selectivity towards desired products.

文献没有直接讨论B基催化剂在ODHP反应中活性位点的空间分布和维度。然而，它确实提供了一些关于h-BN催化剂性质和反应机理的见解，这些可以与这个主题相关联。

与传统的钒氧化物催化剂相比，h-BN在ODHP反应中表现出的高活性和选择性表明，h-BN的独特性质有助于其优异的性能。h-BN优异的热传导性有助于避免反应过程中的热点，这有利于控制反应并防止过度氧化。

反应机理涉及h-BN的边缘BOH基团，这表明一维边缘活性位点在催化过程中起着关键作用。这些边缘位点参与氢的抽取和B-O-O-B中间体的形成，这些都是ODHP反应的关键步骤。

气相自由基反应的参与，由边缘BOH基团的脱氢引发，进一步强调了这些一维边缘位点在整个反应机理中的重要性。这些边缘位点产生的BO和HO2自由基有助于催化剂表面和气相中的脱氢过程。

了解h-BN的这些独特性质和反应机理，特别是一维边缘活性位点的作用，可以有助于设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂。通过优化这些边缘位点的暴露和密度，可能可以提高催化性能和对目标产物的选择性。
