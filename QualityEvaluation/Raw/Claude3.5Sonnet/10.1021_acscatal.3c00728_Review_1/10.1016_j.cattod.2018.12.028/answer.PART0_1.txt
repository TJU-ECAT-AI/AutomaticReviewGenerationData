[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

[2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

[3] "we found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

[4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. The literature suggests that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, which have a 2D structure, demonstrate impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP compared to traditional supported vanadium oxide catalysts. 

The unique properties of h-BN, particularly its superior thermal conductivity, contribute to better heat distribution and the avoidance of hotspots during reactions. This thermal management is crucial for preventing secondary reactions and deep oxidation, thus improving selectivity towards desired products.

The reaction mechanism involves 1D edge active sites, specifically the edge B-OH groups. These groups can be dehydrogenated by O2 to generate BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals, which then participate in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. This understanding of the reaction mechanism at the edge sites has led to the development of more efficient catalysts.

The dimensionality of the catalyst structure also plays a role in reaction performance. The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite catalysts provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, leading to higher propane conversion compared to h-BN powder. This demonstrates how the 3D structure of the catalyst support can enhance the overall catalytic performance by facilitating both surface and gas-phase reactions.

Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms of B-based catalysts, particularly the role of 1D edge active sites and the benefits of 2D and 3D structures, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the spatial distribution of active sites and leveraging the thermal and structural advantages of materials like h-BN, researchers can develop catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for industrial use.

B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。文献表明，具有2D结构的六方氮化硼(h-BN)催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出比传统负载型钒氧化物催化剂更高的活性和选择性。

h-BN的独特性质，特别是其优异的热传导性，有助于在反应过程中实现更好的热分布并避免热点的形成。这种热管理对于防止二次反应和深度氧化至关重要，从而提高了对目标产物的选择性。

反应机理涉及1D边缘活性位点，特别是边缘B-OH基团。这些基团可以被O2脱氢生成BO和过氧化氢(HO2)自由基，然后参与烷烃的脱氢过程。对边缘位点反应机理的理解促进了更高效催化剂的开发。

催化剂结构的维度也影响反应性能。h-BN/堇青石催化剂的直通道结构为气相自由基反应提供了空间，与h-BN粉末相比，导致了更高的丙烷转化率。这表明催化剂载体的3D结构可以通过促进表面和气相反应来提高整体催化性能。

了解B基催化剂的这些独特性质和反应机理，特别是1D边缘活性位点的作用以及2D和3D结构的优势，对设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂具有重要意义。通过优化活性位点的空间分布，并利用h-BN等材料的热学和结构优势，研究人员可以开发出活性、选择性和稳定性更高的工业用催化剂。
