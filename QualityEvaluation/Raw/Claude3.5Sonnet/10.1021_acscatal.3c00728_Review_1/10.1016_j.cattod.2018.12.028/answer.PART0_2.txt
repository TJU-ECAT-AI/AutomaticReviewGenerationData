[1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

[2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

[3] "The edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

[4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

The literature does not directly discuss the spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts for ODHP reactions. However, it does provide some insights into the performance and mechanisms of h-BN catalysts, which can be related to their structure.

The superior performance of h-BN catalysts in ODHP reactions compared to traditional vanadium oxide catalysts is highlighted. This suggests that the unique structure of h-BN contributes to its improved activity and selectivity.

The literature mentions edge BOH groups as active sites for the reaction, indicating that 1-D edge sites play a crucial role in the catalytic process. These edge sites are involved in the formation of BO radicals, which catalyze hydrogen abstraction from the alkane.

The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite catalysts is noted to provide space for gas-phase radical reactions, leading to higher propane conversion compared to h-BN powder. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of the catalyst influences its performance by facilitating both surface and gas-phase reactions.

The superior thermal conductivity of h-BN is mentioned as a factor in reducing hotspots during the reaction, which is crucial for maintaining selectivity and avoiding over-oxidation. This property is likely related to the 2-D layered structure of h-BN.

Understanding these structural features and their impact on reaction mechanisms can contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial applications. By optimizing the distribution of edge sites, channel structures, and thermal properties, researchers can potentially enhance the performance of B-based catalysts in ODHP reactions.
