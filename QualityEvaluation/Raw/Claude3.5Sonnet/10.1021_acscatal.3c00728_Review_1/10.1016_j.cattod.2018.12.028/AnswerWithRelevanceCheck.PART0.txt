          [1] "Recently, h-BN has been demonstrated impressive activity and selectivity for ODHP, which is much higher than that over traditionally used supported vanadium oxide catalysts"

          [2] "Lin et al. found that hotspots in h-BN catalyst bed (less than 1 ) is effectively avoided compared with the widely used VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (8 ) during the ODHP reaction at a similar propane conversion (25%) by computational fluid dynamics calculation method, which primarily benefit from the superior thermal conductivity of h-BN"

          [3] "We found that the edge BOH groups may be dehydrogenated by O2, generating BO and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals. The BO radical catalyzes hydrogen abstraction of ethane to produce C2H5 radical while the HO2 radical may also be involved in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase."

          [4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

          [5] "The EDS mapping of boron and nitrogen showed a highly and uniformly dispersed h-BN over the monolithic catalyst"

          The spatial distribution and dimensionality of active sites in B-based catalysts significantly influence their performance in ODHP reactions. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) demonstrates superior activity and selectivity compared to traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The unique properties and reaction mechanisms of h-BN, particularly its 1-D edge active sites, play a crucial role in its performance:

          1. Edge active sites: The edge BOH groups are key in the reaction mechanism, being dehydrogenated by O2 to generate BO and HO2 radicals. These radicals facilitate hydrogen abstraction from alkanes, both on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

          2. Thermal conductivity: The superior thermal conductivity of h-BN helps avoid hotspots during the reaction, leading to better control and improved selectivity. This is a significant advantage over traditional catalysts like VOx/γ-Al2O3.

          3. Spatial distribution: The uniform dispersion of h-BN over monolithic catalysts contributes to its high performance. The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, enhancing propane conversion compared to h-BN powder.

          Understanding these unique properties and reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of 1-D edge active sites and the benefits of 2-D and 3-D structures, contributes significantly to the design of more efficient catalysts for commercial ODHP applications. By optimizing the exposure and density of edge sites, channel structures, and thermal properties, researchers can potentially enhance the catalytic performance and selectivity towards desired products.

          B基催化剂中活性位点的空间分布和维度对ODHP反应的性能有显著影响。六方氮化硼（h-BN）与传统的钒氧化物催化剂相比，表现出更高的活性和选择性。h-BN的独特性质和反应机理，特别是其一维边缘活性位点，在其性能中起着关键作用：

          1. 边缘活性位点：边缘BOH基团在反应机理中起关键作用，被O2脱氢生成BO和HO2自由基。这些自由基促进烷烃的氢抽提，无论是在催化剂表面还是在气相中。

          2. 热传导性：h-BN优异的热传导性有助于避免反应过程中的热点形成，从而实现更好的控制和提高选择性。这是相对于传统催化剂如VOx/γ-Al2O3的一个重要优势。

          3. 空间分布：h-BN在整体催化剂上的均匀分散有助于其高性能表现。h-BN/堇青石的发达直通道结构为气相自由基反应提供了空间，与h-BN粉末相比，提高了丙烷转化率。

          理解这些独特的性质和反应机理，特别是一维边缘活性位点的作用以及二维和三维结构的优势，对设计更高效的商业ODHP应用催化剂具有重要意义。通过优化边缘位点的暴露和密度、通道结构和热性能，研究人员可能会提高催化性能和对目标产物的选择性。
