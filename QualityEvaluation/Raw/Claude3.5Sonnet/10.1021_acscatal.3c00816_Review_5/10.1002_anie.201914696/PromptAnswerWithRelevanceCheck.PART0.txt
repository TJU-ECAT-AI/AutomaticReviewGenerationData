Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or their use in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on boron-containing zeolites and their catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which is a different process from PDH. The text does not discuss the combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in zeolites or their effects on accessibility and performance in PDH reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献中没有关于分级沸石、其合成方法或在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用的信息。该文档主要讨论含硼沸石及其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中的催化活性，这与PDH是不同的过程。文本没有讨论沸石中微孔和介孔/大孔的组合，或它们对PDH反应的可及性和性能的影响。因此，无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores, types and synthesis methods, or their performance in PDH reactions. The text focuses on boron-containing zeolites (specifically B-MWW) and their catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, rather than discussing hierarchical zeolites or propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
