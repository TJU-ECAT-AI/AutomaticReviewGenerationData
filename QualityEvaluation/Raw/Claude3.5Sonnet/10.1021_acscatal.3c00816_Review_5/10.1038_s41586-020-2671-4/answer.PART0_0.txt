[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores"

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "In a typical synthesis of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate, 20 g of sodium silicate solution was diluted with 24 g of distilled water. The diluted sodium silicate solution was mixed with a clear solution consisting of 36 g of water and 4.7 g of C18-6-4."

[4] "The framework Ga species in the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate was removed by HNO3 treatments."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure facilitates both reactant and product diffusion while allowing high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned in the text is a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure. The synthesis method described involves using a multi-ammonium surfactant (C18-6-4) as a structure-directing agent. The process includes mixing sodium silicate solution with the surfactant, adding gallium nitrate, and then crystallizing the mixture at high temperature.

An additional step to create more defect sites (silanol nests) involves removing framework Ga species from the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate through HNO3 treatments, resulting in a material referred to as mz-deGa.

The text does not provide a direct comparison of the performance of these hierarchical zeolites to traditional zeolites in PDH reactions. However, it does mention that the use of this hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolite structure as a support for PtREE catalysts led to a striking enhancement in all aspects of PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability. This suggests that the hierarchical structure significantly improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional supports like alumina.

分级沸石通过提供独特的结构来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。这种结构具有超薄的沸石骨架和三维互连的介孔，既促进反应物和产物的扩散，又允许金属纳米粒子在介孔内高度分散。

文中提到的主要分级沸石类型是具有分级微孔/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石。描述的合成方法涉及使用多铵表面活性剂（C18-6-4）作为结构导向剂。该过程包括将硅酸钠溶液与表面活性剂混合，添加硝酸镓，然后在高温下结晶混合物。

创建更多缺陷位点（硅醇巢）的额外步骤包括通过HNO3处理从介孔MFI镓硅酸盐中移除骨架Ga物种，得到一种称为mz-deGa的材料。

文本没有直接比较这些分级沸石与传统沸石在PDH反应中的性能。然而，它确实提到将这种分级微孔/介孔沸石结构用作PtREE催化剂的载体，导致PDH催化性能在各个方面都有显著提高，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。这表明，与传统的氧化铝载体相比，分级结构显著改善了PDH反应的性能。
