[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores"

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The mz-deGa zeolite was prepared by the post-synthetic degallation of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite, which was prepared using [C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2 (denoted as C18-6-4) as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure facilitates both reactant and product diffusion while allowing high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned in the literature is a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure. The synthesis method described involves using a multi-ammonium surfactant (specifically [C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2, denoted as C18-6-4) as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent. Additionally, a post-synthetic degallation process is used to create the mz-deGa zeolite.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons of PDH reaction performance between hierarchical zeolites and traditional zeolites. However, it mentions that these hierarchical zeolites are used as a replacement for alumina support in the search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst, suggesting improved performance. The enhanced reactant and product diffusion, coupled with better metal nanoparticle dispersion, likely contribute to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

分级沸石通过提供独特的结构来增强PDH反应的可及性，这种结构具有超薄的沸石骨架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构既促进反应物和产物的扩散，又允许金属纳米粒子在介孔内高度分散。

文献中提到的主要分级沸石类型是具有分级微孔/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石。所描述的合成方法涉及使用多铵表面活性剂（具体为[C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2，简称C18-6-4）作为微孔/介孔结构导向剂。此外，还使用了后合成脱镓过程来制备mz-deGa沸石。

文献没有直接比较分级沸石和传统沸石在PDH反应性能方面的差异。但是，它提到这些分级沸石被用作氧化铝载体的替代品，以寻找高活性和更耐久的PDH催化剂，这暗示了性能的改进。反应物和产物扩散的增强，加上更好的金属纳米粒子分散，可能会导致PDH反应中的催化性能比传统沸石有所改善。
