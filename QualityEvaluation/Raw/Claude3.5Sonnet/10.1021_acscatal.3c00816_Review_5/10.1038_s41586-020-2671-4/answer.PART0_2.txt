[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores"

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure facilitates both reactant and product diffusion while allowing high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned in the literature is a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure. The synthesis method described involves using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent.

Compared to traditional zeolites, these hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions by:

1. Boosting catalytic performance of supported metals
2. Providing easier diffusion for reactants and products
3. Enabling high metal nanoparticle dispersion
4. Allowing incorporation of rare-earth elements like La and Y, which improve Pt catalyst dispersion through strong metal-support interactions
5. Stabilizing Pt in the form of small nanoparticles

The literature suggests that using these hierarchical zeolites as a support for PDH catalysts results in higher activity and durability compared to traditional alumina supports.

分级沸石通过提供独特的结构来增强PDH反应的可及性，该结构包括超薄的沸石骨架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构既促进了反应物和产物的扩散，又允许在介孔中实现高金属纳米粒子分散。

文献中提到的主要分级沸石类型是具有分级微孔/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石。所描述的合成方法涉及使用多铵表面活性剂作为结构导向剂。

与传统沸石相比，这些分级沸石通过以下方式改善了PDH反应的性能：

1. 提高负载金属的催化性能
2. 为反应物和产物提供更容易的扩散途径
3. 实现高金属纳米粒子分散
4. 允许掺入稀土元素如La和Y，这些元素通过强金属-载体相互作用改善Pt催化剂的分散
5. 将Pt稳定在小纳米粒子的形态中

文献表明，与传统的氧化铝载体相比，使用这些分级沸石作为PDH催化剂的载体可以获得更高的活性和耐久性。
