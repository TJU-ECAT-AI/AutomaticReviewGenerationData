[1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores"

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The mz-deGa zeolite was prepared by the post-synthetic degallation of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite, which was prepared using [C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2 (denoted as C18-6-4) as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure facilitates both reactant and product diffusion while allowing high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned in the text is a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure. The synthesis method described involves using a multi-ammonium surfactant (specifically [C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2, denoted as C18-6-4) as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent. Additionally, a post-synthetic degallation process is mentioned for preparing mz-deGa zeolite from mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite.

The text does not provide a direct comparison of the performance of these hierarchical zeolites to traditional zeolites in PDH reactions. However, it is stated that these materials are being investigated as a replacement for alumina support in the search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst, suggesting potential improvements in catalytic performance.

分级沸石通过提供独特的结构来增强PDH反应的可及性，这种结构包括超薄的沸石框架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构既促进反应物和产物的扩散，又允许金属纳米粒子在介孔内高度分散。

文中提到的主要分级沸石类型是具有分级微孔/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石。所描述的合成方法涉及使用多铵表面活性剂（特别是[C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2，简称C18-6-4）作为微孔/介孔结构导向剂。此外，还提到了一种从介孔MFI镓硅酸盐沸石制备mz-deGa沸石的后合成脱镓过程。

文中没有直接比较这些分级沸石与传统沸石在PDH反应中的性能。然而，文中提到这些材料正在被研究用作氧化铝载体的替代品，以寻找高活性和更耐用的PDH催化剂，这暗示了在催化性能方面可能有所改进。
