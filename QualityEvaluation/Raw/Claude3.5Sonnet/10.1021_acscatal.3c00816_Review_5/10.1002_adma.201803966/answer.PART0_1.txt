[1] "Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites to generate larger and more accessible void nanospaces has proven to be an efficient method for encapsulating small metal clusters with high loadings within zeolite matrices."

[2] "In addition, the introduction of additional mesopores could not only maintain MNPs against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions but also decrease the diffusion limitation and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of products over such catalysts."

[3] "Recently, a new type of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers (2 nm) has been synthesized by the Ryoo and Tsapatsis groups."

[4] "Compared with conventional ZSM-5 nanosized zeolites, the self-pillared nanosheet-like zeolites could effectively control the sizes of Pt clusters (1.0 nm) due to the remarkably increased external surface areas."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like PDH by introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites. This generates more accessible void spaces, allowing for encapsulation of small metal clusters with high loadings. The additional mesopores help maintain metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching, while also decreasing diffusion limitations and increasing catalytic activity and selectivity.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites mentioned include:
1. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores
2. Self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers

Synthesis methods include:
1. Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchants to create intracrystal mesopores
2. Synthesis of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by:
1. Allowing for higher metal loadings while maintaining small cluster sizes
2. Decreasing diffusion limitations
3. Increasing catalytic activity and selectivity
4. Improving stability of metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching
5. Providing better control over metal cluster sizes due to increased external surface areas

While the text does not specifically mention PDH reactions, these benefits would likely apply to PDH as well as other catalytic reactions requiring good accessibility to active sites.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石中引入更大的次级孔来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强对PDH等反应的可及性。这会产生更易接近的空隙空间，允许高负载量的小金属簇封装。额外的介孔有助于防止金属纳米颗粒烧结和流失，同时还降低了扩散限制，提高了催化活性和选择性。

提到的主要分级沸石类型包括：
1. 具有晶内介孔的沸石
2. 具有纳米片层的自支撑介孔沸石

合成方法包括：
1. 用碱性或氟化物蚀刻剂对沸石进行后处理以创建晶内介孔
2. 合成具有纳米片层的自支撑介孔沸石

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能：
1. 在保持小簇大小的同时允许更高的金属负载
2. 降低扩散限制
3. 提高催化活性和选择性
4. 改善金属纳米颗粒抗烧结和流失的稳定性
5. 由于外部表面积增加，对金属簇大小提供更好的控制

虽然文本没有特别提到PDH反应，但这些好处可能适用于PDH以及其他需要良好接触活性位点的催化反应。
