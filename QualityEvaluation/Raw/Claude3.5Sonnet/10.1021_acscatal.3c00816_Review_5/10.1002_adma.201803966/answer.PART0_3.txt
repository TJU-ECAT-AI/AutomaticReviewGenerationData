[1] "Recently, a series of metals supported on hierarchically porous catalysts have been synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials."

[2] "Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures."

[3] "In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like PDH by taking advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and the transport efficiency of larger pores. The mesopores act as nanospaces to accommodate small metal nanoparticles, restraining their migration and preventing sintering at high temperatures. 

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with intracrystalline mesopores and intercrystalline mesopores. They can be synthesized via bottom-up methods (e.g. using soft or hard templates during zeolite crystallization) or top-down methods (post-synthesis treatments like desilication).

While the literature does not specifically discuss PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites generally improve catalytic performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Enhancing diffusion of reactants and products
2. Increasing the accessibility of active sites 
3. Allowing better dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles
4. Reducing coke formation and extending catalyst lifetime

The ability to control pore structures and metal particle sizes through hierarchical zeolite synthesis offers a promising route to design high-performance catalysts for reactions like PDH.

分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH等反应的可及性,利用了微孔的形状选择性和大孔的传输效率。介孔作为纳米空间可容纳小型金属纳米颗粒,限制它们的迁移并防止在高温下烧结。

分级沸石的主要类型包括具有晶内介孔和晶间介孔的沸石。它们可以通过自下而上的方法(例如在沸石结晶过程中使用软模板或硬模板)或自上而下的方法(脱硅等后合成处理)合成。

虽然文献没有具体讨论PDH反应,但与传统沸石相比,分级沸石通常通过以下方式改善催化性能:

1. 增强反应物和产物的扩散
2. 提高活性位点的可及性
3. 允许金属纳米颗粒更好地分散和稳定
4. 减少积炭形成并延长催化剂寿命

通过分级沸石合成控制孔结构和金属颗粒尺寸的能力为设计PDH等反应的高性能催化剂提供了一条有前景的途径。
