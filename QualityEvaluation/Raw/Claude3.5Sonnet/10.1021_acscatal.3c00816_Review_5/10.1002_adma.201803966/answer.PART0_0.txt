[1] "Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites to generate larger and more accessible void nanospaces has proven to be an efficient method for encapsulating small metal clusters with high loadings within zeolite matrices."

[2] "In addition, the introduction of additional mesopores could not only maintain MNPs against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions but also decrease the diffusion limitation and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of products over such catalysts."

[3] "Recently, a new type of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers (2 nm) has been synthesized by the Ryoo and Tsapatsis groups."

[4] "Fabricating intracrystalline mesopores inside the zeolite crystals could be a good approach to maintaining micropore-selective catalysis."

[5] "Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchant can create intracrystal mesopores; however, the etching process is usually accompanied by the formation of open pores connected to the surface."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like PDH by creating larger void spaces and additional pores within the zeolite structure. This improves diffusion and increases catalytic activity and selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers
2. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores 

The main synthesis methods include:
1. Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites
2. Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchants
3. Self-pillaring of zeolite nanosheets

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:
1. Maintaining metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching 
2. Decreasing diffusion limitations
3. Increasing catalytic activity and selectivity
4. Providing larger accessible void spaces for encapsulating metal clusters
5. Maintaining micropore-selective catalysis while improving overall accessibility

While the literature does not specifically mention PDH reactions, these benefits would likely apply to improve PDH performance as well.

分级沸石通过在沸石结构中创造更大的空隙和额外的孔来结合微孔和介孔/大孔,以增强对PDH等反应的可及性。与传统沸石相比,这改善了扩散并提高了催化活性和选择性。

分级沸石的主要类型包括:
1. 具有纳米片层的自支撑介孔沸石
2. 具有晶内介孔的沸石

主要的合成方法包括:
1. 在微孔沸石中引入更大的次级孔
2. 用碱性或氟化物蚀刻剂对沸石进行后处理
3. 沸石纳米片的自支撑

与传统沸石相比,分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能:
1. 防止金属纳米粒子烧结和流失
2. 降低扩散限制
3. 提高催化活性和选择性
4. 提供更大的可及空隙以包覆金属簇
5. 在改善整体可及性的同时保持微孔选择性催化

虽然文献没有特别提到PDH反应,但这些优势可能也适用于改善PDH性能。
