[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."

[2] "Recently, a series of metals supported on hierarchically porous catalysts have been synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by taking advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of mesoporous materials. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are those synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. 

The mesopores in hierarchical supports act as nanospaces to accommodate small metal nanoparticles (MNPs), which greatly restrains the free migration of metal species and prevents severe sintering at high temperatures. This improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Enhancing mass transfer and accessibility to active sites
2. Allowing better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles
3. Preventing sintering and deactivation of the catalyst at high temperatures

While the literature does not specifically mention PDH reactions, these benefits of hierarchical zeolites would likely apply to improve their performance in such reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性,利用了微孔的形状选择性和介孔材料的传输效率。分级沸石的主要类型是通过自下而上和自上而下的方法合成的。

分级载体中的介孔作为纳米空间容纳小金属纳米粒子(MNPs),这极大地限制了金属物种的自由迁移,并防止了在高温下的严重烧结。与传统沸石相比,这通过以下方式改善了PDH反应的性能:

1. 增强了传质和活性位点的可及性
2. 允许金属纳米粒子更好地分散和稳定
3. 防止催化剂在高温下烧结和失活

虽然文献没有具体提到PDH反应,但这些分级沸石的优势很可能适用于改善其在此类反应中的性能,相较于传统沸石而言。
