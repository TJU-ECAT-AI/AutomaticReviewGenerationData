[1] "Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites to generate larger and more accessible void nanospaces has proven to be an efficient method for encapsulating small metal clusters with high loadings within zeolite matrices."

[2] "In addition, the introduction of additional mesopores could not only maintain MNPs against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions but also decrease the diffusion limitation and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of products over such catalysts."

[3] "Recently, a new type of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers (2 nm) has been synthesized by the Ryoo and Tsapatsis groups."

[4] "Fabricating intracrystalline mesopores inside the zeolite crystals could be a good approach to maintaining micropore-selective catalysis."

[5] "Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchant can create intracrystal mesopores; however, the etching process is usually accompanied by the formation of open pores connected to the surface."

1. Self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers
2. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores 

The main synthesis methods include:
1. Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites
2. Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchants
3. Self-pillaring of zeolite nanosheets

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."

[2] "Recently, a series of metals supported on hierarchically porous catalysts have been synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by taking advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of mesoporous materials. The main types of hierarchical zeolites are those synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. 

The mesopores in hierarchical supports act as nanospaces to accommodate small metal nanoparticles (MNPs), which greatly restrains the free migration of metal species and prevents severe sintering at high temperatures. This improves the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Enhancing mass transfer and accessibility to active sites
2. Allowing better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles
3. Preventing sintering and deactivation of the catalyst at high temperatures

While the literature does not specifically mention PDH reactions, these benefits of hierarchical zeolites would likely apply to improve their performance in such reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like PDH by taking advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and the transport efficiency of larger pores. The mesopores act as nanospaces to accommodate small metal nanoparticles, restraining their migration and preventing sintering at high temperatures. 

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include those with intracrystalline mesopores and intercrystalline mesopores. They can be synthesized via bottom-up methods (e.g. using soft or hard templates during zeolite crystallization) or top-down methods (post-synthesis treatments like desilication).

While the literature does not specifically discuss PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites generally improve catalytic performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Enhancing diffusion of reactants and products
2. Increasing the accessibility of active sites 
3. Allowing better dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles
4. Reducing coke formation and extending catalyst lifetime

The ability to control pore structures and metal particle sizes through hierarchical zeolite synthesis offers a promising route to design high-performance catalysts for reactions like PDH.
