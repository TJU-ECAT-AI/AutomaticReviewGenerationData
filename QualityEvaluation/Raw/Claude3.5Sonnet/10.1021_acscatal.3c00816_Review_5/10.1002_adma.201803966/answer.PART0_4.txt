[1] "Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites to generate larger and more accessible void nanospaces has proven to be an efficient method for encapsulating small metal clusters with high loadings within zeolite matrices."

[2] "In addition, the introduction of additional mesopores could not only maintain MNPs against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions but also decrease the diffusion limitation and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of products over such catalysts."

[3] "Recently, a new type of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers (2 nm) has been synthesized by the Ryoo and Tsapatsis groups."

[4] "Compared with conventional ZSM-5 nanosized zeolites, the self-pillared nanosheet-like zeolites could effectively control the sizes of Pt clusters (1.0 nm) due to the remarkably increased external surface areas."

[5] "Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchant can create intracrystal mesopores; however, the etching process is usually accompanied by the formation of open pores connected to the surface."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like PDH by introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites. This generates larger and more accessible void nanospaces, which can encapsulate small metal clusters with high loadings. The additional mesopores help maintain metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions, while also decreasing diffusion limitations and increasing catalytic activity and selectivity.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:

1. Self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers
2. Zeolites with intracrystal mesopores

Synthesis methods for these materials include:

1. Self-pillaring of nanosheet layers
2. Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchants

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance by:

1. Effectively controlling the sizes of metal clusters due to increased external surface areas
2. Decreasing diffusion limitations
3. Increasing catalytic activity and selectivity
4. Maintaining metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions

However, it's worth noting that the etching process used to create intracrystal mesopores can sometimes lead to the formation of open pores connected to the surface, which may affect the overall performance.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石中引入更大的二级孔来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH等反应的可及性。这生成了更大、更易接近的空隙纳米空间，可以包封高负载量的小金属簇。额外的介孔有助于在严苛条件下防止金属纳米粒子烧结和流失，同时还能降低扩散限制，提高催化活性和选择性。

分级沸石的主要类型包括：

1. 具有纳米片层的自支撑介孔沸石
2. 具有晶内介孔的沸石

这些材料的合成方法包括：

1. 纳米片层的自支撑
2. 用碱性或氟化物刻蚀剂对沸石进行后处理

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能：

1. 由于外部表面积增加，有效控制金属簇的尺寸
2. 降低扩散限制
3. 提高催化活性和选择性
4. 在严苛条件下防止金属纳米粒子烧结和流失

然而，值得注意的是，用于创建晶内介孔的刻蚀过程有时可能导致与表面相连的开放孔的形成，这可能会影响整体性能。
