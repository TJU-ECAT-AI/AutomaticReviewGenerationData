          [1] "novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."

          [2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."

          [3] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

          The literature describes a hierarchical zeolite structure that combines microporous TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica, creating a composite material called TS-1@SBA-16. This hierarchical structure enhances accessibility for PDH reactions by improving mass transfer performance.

          Synthesis method: The TS-1@SBA-16 composite is synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica.

          Performance improvement: The catalyst with 10% TS-1 content showed the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, which was higher than catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which provides excellent mass transfer properties, suitable acid acidity, and the electronic effect of Ti species.

          However, the literature does not provide comprehensive information on other types of hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or a detailed comparison with traditional zeolites for PDH reactions beyond the TS-1@SBA-16 composite described.

          该文献描述了一种将微孔TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅结合的分级沸石结构，创造了一种称为TS-1@SBA-16的复合材料。这种分级结构通过改善传质性能来增强PDH反应的可及性。

          合成方法：TS-1@SBA-16复合材料是通过将TS-1沸石晶体包裹在介孔SBA-16二氧化硅中合成而成。

          性能改进：含10% TS-1的催化剂显示出最高的PDH活性，初始丙烷转化率达到54.5%，高于单独以TS-1或SBA-16为载体的催化剂。Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16的优异催化性能归因于分级多孔结构的协同效应，该结构提供了优异的传质性能、适当的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应。

          然而，除了所描述的TS-1@SBA-16复合材料外，该文献没有提供关于其他类型分级沸石的综合信息、它们的合成方法或与传统沸石在PDH反应中的详细比较。
