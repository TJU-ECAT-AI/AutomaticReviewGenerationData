The literature describes a hierarchical zeolite that combines micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The material is a composite of TS-1 zeolite crystals (microporous) enwrapped with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This creates a hierarchical porous structure that improves mass transfer performance.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned is TS-1@SBA-16, synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This method creates a composite material with both micropores and mesopores.

The performance improvement in PDH reactions is demonstrated by the higher propane conversion rate (54.5%) achieved by the Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 catalyst compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. This superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which enhances mass transfer, along with suitable acid acidity and the electronic effect of Ti species.

However, the literature does not provide information on other types of hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods, nor does it offer a comprehensive comparison with traditional zeolites for PDH reactions.

该文献描述了一种结合了微孔和介孔的分级沸石，以提高PDH反应的可及性。这种材料是由介孔SBA-16二氧化硅包裹TS-1沸石晶体（微孔）形成的复合材料。这创造了一个分级多孔结构，提高了物质传递性能。

文中提到的主要分级沸石类型是TS-1@SBA-16，通过将TS-1沸石晶体包裹在介孔SBA-16二氧化硅中合成而成。这种方法创造了一种同时具有微孔和介孔的复合材料。

在PDH反应中性能提升的证明是，Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16催化剂实现的丙烷转化率（54.5%）高于单独以TS-1或SBA-16为载体的催化剂。这种优越的性能归因于分级多孔结构的协同效应，它增强了物质传递，同时具有适当的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应。

然而，该文献没有提供其他类型的分级沸石或其合成方法的信息，也没有对PDH反应中与传统沸石的全面比较。
