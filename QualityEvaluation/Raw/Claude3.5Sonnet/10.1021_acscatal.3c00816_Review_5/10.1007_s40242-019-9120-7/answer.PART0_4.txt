[1] "novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."

[2] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The literature provides limited information on hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions. It mentions a novel composite material TS-1@SBA-16, which combines microporous TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This creates a hierarchical porous structure that enhances mass transfer performance. The composite material showed superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. The improved performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species.

However, the literature does not provide comprehensive information on different types of hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or a detailed comparison with traditional zeolites for PDH reactions. More specific information would be needed to fully answer the question about main types, synthesis methods, and comparative performance of hierarchical zeolites in PDH reactions.

该文献对PDH反应中的分级沸石提供了有限的信息。它提到了一种新型复合材料TS-1@SBA-16，该材料将微孔TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅结合。这创造了一种分级多孔结构，提高了传质性能。与仅在TS-1或SBA-16上负载的催化剂相比，这种复合材料在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的催化性能。性能的改善归因于分级多孔结构、适当的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应的协同作用。

然而，该文献并未提供有关不同类型分级沸石、它们的合成方法或与传统沸石在PDH反应中的详细比较的全面信息。需要更具体的信息才能全面回答关于分级沸石在PDH反应中的主要类型、合成方法和比较性能的问题。
