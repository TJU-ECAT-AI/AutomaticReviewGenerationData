The literature does not provide comprehensive information on hierarchical zeolites and their types, synthesis methods, or detailed comparisons with traditional zeolites for PDH reactions. However, it does mention a specific example of a hierarchical zeolite-like material, TS-1@SBA-16, which combines microporous TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica.

This composite material demonstrates improved catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which provides excellent mass transfer properties. The combination of micropores from TS-1 and mesopores from SBA-16 likely contributes to this improved accessibility and mass transfer.

While the document does not explicitly discuss other types of hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods, it suggests that combining microporous and mesoporous materials can lead to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The enwrapping synthesis method described for TS-1@SBA-16 is one approach to creating such hierarchical structures.

该文献并未提供有关分级沸石的综合信息，包括其类型、合成方法或与传统沸石在PDH反应中的详细比较。然而，它确实提到了一个特定的分级沸石类材料的例子，即TS-1@SBA-16，该材料将微孔TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅相结合。

这种复合材料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比单独使用TS-1或SBA-16支撑的催化剂更好的催化性能。这种性能的提升归因于分级多孔结构的协同效应，该结构提供了优异的物质传递性能。TS-1的微孔和SBA-16的介孔的组合可能有助于提高可及性和物质传递效率。

虽然该文档没有明确讨论其他类型的分级沸石或其合成方法，但它表明，结合微孔和介孔材料可以提高PDH反应的催化性能。文中描述的TS-1@SBA-16的包覆合成方法是创建这种分级结构的一种方法。
