[1] "novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."

[2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."

[3] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The literature provides limited information on hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions. However, it does describe a novel composite material TS-1@SBA-16 that combines microporous TS-1 zeolite with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This hierarchical structure enhances mass transfer performance, which contributes to improved catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The synthesis method mentioned involves enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This creates a hierarchical porous structure that combines the micropores of TS-1 with the mesopores of SBA-16.

The performance improvement is demonstrated by the higher propane conversion (54.5%) achieved by the composite material compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. This enhancement is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which improves mass transfer, as well as suitable acid acidity and electronic effects of Ti species.

While the document doesn't provide comprehensive information on different types and synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions, it does showcase one example of how combining microporous and mesoporous materials can enhance catalyst performance in these reactions.

该文献对PDH反应中的分级沸石提供了有限的信息。然而，它描述了一种新型复合材料TS-1@SBA-16，该材料结合了微孔TS-1沸石和介孔SBA-16二氧化硅。这种分级结构增强了传质性能，从而提高了丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性。

提到的合成方法涉及将TS-1沸石晶体包裹在介孔SBA-16二氧化硅中。这创造了一种分级多孔结构，结合了TS-1的微孔和SBA-16的介孔。

性能改进通过复合材料实现的更高丙烷转化率（54.5%）得到证明，相比之下，单独在TS-1或SBA-16上负载的催化剂的转化率较低。这种增强归因于分级多孔结构的协同效应，改善了传质，以及合适的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应。

虽然该文档没有提供PDH反应中不同类型和合成方法的分级沸石的全面信息，但它展示了一个例子，说明了如何通过结合微孔和介孔材料来提高这些反应中的催化剂性能。
