[1] "novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."

[2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."

[3] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The literature describes a hierarchical zeolite structure combining microporous TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This composite material enhances accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a hierarchical porous structure that improves mass transfer performance. The synthesis method involves enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica.

The composite material showed superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The catalyst with 10% TS-1 content achieved an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, which was higher than those supported by TS-1 or SBA-16 alone.

The improved performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species. This combination enhances mass transfer and creates favorable conditions for the PDH reaction.

However, the literature does not provide information on other types of hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods beyond the TS-1@SBA-16 composite described.

该文献描述了一种将微孔TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅结合的分级沸石结构。这种复合材料通过创建分级多孔结构来增强PDH反应的可及性，从而提高了传质性能。合成方法包括用介孔SBA-16二氧化硅包裹TS-1沸石晶体。

与传统沸石相比，该复合材料在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能。含10% TS-1的催化剂实现了54.5%的初始丙烷转化率，高于单独由TS-1或SBA-16支撑的催化剂。

性能的改善归因于分级多孔结构、适当的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应的协同作用。这种组合增强了传质并为PDH反应创造了有利条件。

然而，除了所描述的TS-1@SBA-16复合材料外，该文献没有提供关于其他类型的分级沸石或其合成方法的信息。

The literature provides limited information on hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions. However, it does describe a novel composite material TS-1@SBA-16 that combines microporous TS-1 zeolite with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This hierarchical structure enhances mass transfer performance, which contributes to improved catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The synthesis method mentioned involves enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This creates a hierarchical porous structure that combines the micropores of TS-1 with the mesopores of SBA-16.

The performance improvement is demonstrated by the higher propane conversion (54.5%) achieved by the composite material compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. This enhancement is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which improves mass transfer, as well as suitable acid acidity and electronic effects of Ti species.

While the document doesn't provide comprehensive information on different types and synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions, it does showcase one example of how combining microporous and mesoporous materials can enhance catalyst performance in these reactions.

该文献对PDH反应中的分级沸石提供了有限的信息。然而，它描述了一种新型复合材料TS-1@SBA-16，该材料结合了微孔TS-1沸石和介孔SBA-16二氧化硅。这种分级结构增强了传质性能，从而提高了丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性。

提到的合成方法涉及将TS-1沸石晶体包裹在介孔SBA-16二氧化硅中。这创造了一种分级多孔结构，结合了TS-1的微孔和SBA-16的介孔。

性能改进通过复合材料实现的更高丙烷转化率（54.5%）得到证明，相比之下，单独在TS-1或SBA-16上负载的催化剂的转化率较低。这种增强归因于分级多孔结构的协同效应，改善了传质，以及合适的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应。

虽然该文档没有提供PDH反应中不同类型和合成方法的分级沸石的全面信息，但它展示了一个例子，说明了如何通过结合微孔和介孔材料来提高这些反应中的催化剂性能。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on hierarchical zeolites and their types, synthesis methods, or detailed comparisons with traditional zeolites for PDH reactions. However, it does mention a specific example of a hierarchical zeolite-like material, TS-1@SBA-16, which combines microporous TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica.

This composite material demonstrates improved catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which provides excellent mass transfer properties. The combination of micropores from TS-1 and mesopores from SBA-16 likely contributes to this improved accessibility and mass transfer.

While the document does not explicitly discuss other types of hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods, it suggests that combining microporous and mesoporous materials can lead to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The enwrapping synthesis method described for TS-1@SBA-16 is one approach to creating such hierarchical structures.

该文献并未提供有关分级沸石的综合信息，包括其类型、合成方法或与传统沸石在PDH反应中的详细比较。然而，它确实提到了一个特定的分级沸石类材料的例子，即TS-1@SBA-16，该材料将微孔TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅相结合。

这种复合材料在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出比单独使用TS-1或SBA-16支撑的催化剂更好的催化性能。这种性能的提升归因于分级多孔结构的协同效应，该结构提供了优异的物质传递性能。TS-1的微孔和SBA-16的介孔的组合可能有助于提高可及性和物质传递效率。

虽然该文档没有明确讨论其他类型的分级沸石或其合成方法，但它表明，结合微孔和介孔材料可以提高PDH反应的催化性能。文中描述的TS-1@SBA-16的包覆合成方法是创建这种分级结构的一种方法。

The literature describes a hierarchical zeolite that combines micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions. The material is a composite of TS-1 zeolite crystals (microporous) enwrapped with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This creates a hierarchical porous structure that improves mass transfer performance.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned is TS-1@SBA-16, synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This method creates a composite material with both micropores and mesopores.

The performance improvement in PDH reactions is demonstrated by the higher propane conversion rate (54.5%) achieved by the Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 catalyst compared to catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone. This superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, which enhances mass transfer, along with suitable acid acidity and the electronic effect of Ti species.

However, the literature does not provide information on other types of hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods, nor does it offer a comprehensive comparison with traditional zeolites for PDH reactions.
