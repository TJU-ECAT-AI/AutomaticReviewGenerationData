[2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."

[3] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The literature describes a hierarchical zeolite structure combining microporous TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This composite material enhances accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a hierarchical porous structure that improves mass transfer performance. The synthesis method involves enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica.

The composite material showed superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The catalyst with 10% TS-1 content achieved an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, which was higher than those supported by TS-1 or SBA-16 alone.

The improved performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity, and electronic effect of Ti species. This combination enhances mass transfer and creates favorable conditions for the PDH reaction.

However, the literature does not provide information on other types of hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods beyond the TS-1@SBA-16 composite described.

该文献描述了一种将微孔TS-1沸石晶体与介孔SBA-16二氧化硅结合的分级沸石结构。这种复合材料通过创建分级多孔结构来增强PDH反应的可及性，从而提高了传质性能。合成方法包括用介孔SBA-16二氧化硅包裹TS-1沸石晶体。

与传统沸石相比，该复合材料在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能。含10% TS-1的催化剂实现了54.5%的初始丙烷转化率，高于单独由TS-1或SBA-16支撑的催化剂。

性能的改善归因于分级多孔结构、适当的酸度和Ti物种的电子效应的协同作用。这种组合增强了传质并为PDH反应创造了有利条件。

然而，除了所描述的TS-1@SBA-16复合材料外，该文献没有提供关于其他类型的分级沸石或其合成方法的信息。
