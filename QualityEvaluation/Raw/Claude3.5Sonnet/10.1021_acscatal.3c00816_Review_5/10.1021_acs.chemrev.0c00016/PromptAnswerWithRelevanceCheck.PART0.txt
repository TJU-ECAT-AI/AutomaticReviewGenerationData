[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "The preparation methods can be divided principally into the post-treatment synthetic routes and the in situ synthetic routes."

[4] "The post-treatment, including the selective desilication/dealumination processes, is mainly a destructive procedure by sacrificing part of the zeolite crystals to create larger meso- or macropores."

[5] "The in situ synthesis approach usually uses the organic or inorganic templates in the zeolite crystallization process."

[6] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions"

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. These can be synthesized through post-treatment methods like selective desilication/dealumination or in situ methods using organic or inorganic templates during zeolite crystallization.

These hierarchical structures improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by providing unimpeded transport paths through macropores, enhanced accessibility to active sites via mesopores, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic activity of the micropores. This combination allows for faster diffusion of reactants and products, reduced mass transfer limitations, and potentially higher catalytic activity and stability. However, the literature does not provide specific performance data for PDH reactions.

分级沸石通过将微孔与介孔和/或大孔相结合，提高了丙烷脱氢(PDH)等反应的可及性。主要类型包括微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。这些可以通过后处理方法(如选择性脱硅/脱铝)或使用有机或无机模板的原位方法在沸石结晶过程中合成。

与传统沸石相比，这些分级结构通过大孔提供无阻碍的传输路径，通过介孔增强了对活性位点的可及性，同时保持了微孔的固有催化活性，从而提高了PDH反应性能。这种组合允许反应物和产物更快的扩散，减少了传质限制，并可能提高催化活性和稳定性。然而，文献中并未提供PDH反应的具体性能数据。

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with meso- and/or macropores to enhance accessibility and transport properties. The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. They can be synthesized using in situ or postsynthetic approaches. 

While the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it indicates that hierarchical zeolites generally exhibit superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime compared to traditional microporous zeolites. This improvement is attributed to the optimal mesopore quality, including size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals. These properties enhance mass transfer and accessibility to active sites, which would likely benefit PDH reactions by allowing easier access for propane molecules and facilitating the removal of products.

The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. These can be synthesized using in situ methods like hard and soft templating to produce ordered structures, or post-synthesis methods.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions. The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. Synthesis methods fall into two main categories: in situ approaches and postsynthetic approaches. 

These hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing enhanced access and transport through the additional meso/macroporous system while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic properties of the micropores. This results in superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime due to optimal mesopore quality including size, distribution, and connectivity within the zeolite crystals.

While the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the principles of improved accessibility and mass transport provided by hierarchical zeolites would likely benefit PDH reactions involving bulky molecules by reducing diffusion limitations.

[3] "The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites can be achieved either by introducing an additional pore system into zeolite single crystals, either during the crystallization process of the zeolite crystal or in an already synthesized microporous zeolite (intracrystalline mesopore, Figure 29A), or by a purposeful aggregation of individual zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets (intercrystalline mesopore, Figure 29C,E)."

[4] "The introduced mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for catalytic reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. 

Synthesis methods include:
1. Introducing additional pores into zeolite crystals during crystallization or post-synthesis
2. Aggregating zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets to create intercrystalline mesopores

These hierarchical structures improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites by:
1. Accelerating mass transport 
2. Reducing diffusion path length for reactants
3. Improving accessibility to active sites
4. Facilitating escape of products
5. Increasing reactant conversion and product selectivity
6. Extending catalyst lifetime

The enhanced mass transfer and accessibility provided by the additional meso/macropores, combined with the intrinsic catalytic properties of the micropores, make hierarchical zeolites superior catalysts for reactions involving larger molecules like propane.
