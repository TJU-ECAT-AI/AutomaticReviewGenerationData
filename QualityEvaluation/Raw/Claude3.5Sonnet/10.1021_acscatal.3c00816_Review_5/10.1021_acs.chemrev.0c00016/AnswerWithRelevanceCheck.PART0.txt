          [1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "The preparation methods can be divided principally into the post-treatment synthetic routes and the in situ synthetic routes."

[4] "The post-treatment, including the selective desilication/dealumination processes, is mainly a destructive procedure by sacrificing part of the zeolite crystals to create larger meso- or macropores."

[5] "The in situ synthesis approach usually uses the organic or inorganic templates in the zeolite crystallization process."

[6] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions"

[7] "The introduced mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites.

Synthesis methods include:
1. Post-treatment synthetic routes: selective desilication/dealumination processes that create larger meso- or macropores by sacrificing part of the zeolite crystals.
2. In situ synthetic routes: using organic or inorganic templates during the zeolite crystallization process.

These hierarchical structures improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:
1. Providing unimpeded transport paths through macropores
2. Enhancing accessibility to active sites via mesopores
3. Maintaining the intrinsic catalytic activity of micropores
4. Accelerating mass transport
5. Reducing diffusion paths for reactants
6. Improving accessibility of reactants to active sites
7. Facilitating the escape of products
8. Increasing reactant conversion and product selectivity
9. Extending catalyst lifetime

This combination allows for faster diffusion of reactants and products, reduced mass transfer limitations, and potentially higher catalytic activity and stability. However, the literature does not provide specific performance data for PDH reactions.

          分级沸石通过将微孔与介孔和/或大孔相结合，提高了丙烷脱氢(PDH)等反应的可及性。主要类型包括微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。

合成方法包括：
1. 后处理合成路线：选择性脱硅/脱铝过程，通过牺牲部分沸石晶体来创造更大的介孔或大孔。
2. 原位合成路线：在沸石结晶过程中使用有机或无机模板。

与传统沸石相比，这些分级结构通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能：
1. 通过大孔提供无阻碍的传输路径
2. 通过介孔增强对活性位点的可及性
3. 保持微孔的固有催化活性
4. 加速质量传输
5. 缩短反应物的扩散路径
6. 提高反应物对活性位点的可及性
7. 促进产物逸出
8. 提高反应物转化率和产物选择性
9. 延长催化剂寿命

这种组合允许反应物和产物更快的扩散，减少了传质限制，并可能提高催化活性和稳定性。然而，文献中并未提供PDH反应的具体性能数据。
