[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "Many new approaches, herein classified as either the in situ approach or postsynthetic approach, have been developed."

[4] "The hierarchical zeolite catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites, which is due to their optimal mesopore quality, such as the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with meso- and/or macropores to enhance accessibility and transport properties. The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. They can be synthesized using in situ or postsynthetic approaches. 

While the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it indicates that hierarchical zeolites generally exhibit superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime compared to traditional microporous zeolites. This improvement is attributed to the optimal mesopore quality, including size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals. These properties enhance mass transfer and accessibility to active sites, which would likely benefit PDH reactions by allowing easier access for propane molecules and facilitating the removal of products.

分级沸石将微孔与介孔和/或大孔相结合，以增强可及性和传输性能。主要类型包括微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。它们可以通过原位或后合成方法进行合成。

虽然文献并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，但它表明分级沸石通常比传统的微孔沸石表现出更优越的催化活性、选择性和寿命。这种改进归因于最佳的介孔质量，包括晶体内部介孔的大小、分布和连通性。这些特性增强了质量传递和活性位点的可及性，这可能会使PDH反应受益，因为它允许丙烷分子更容易进入并促进产物的移除。
