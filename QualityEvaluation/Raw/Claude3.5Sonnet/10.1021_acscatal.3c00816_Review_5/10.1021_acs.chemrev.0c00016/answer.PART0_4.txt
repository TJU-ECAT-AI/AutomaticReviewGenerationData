[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites can be achieved either by introducing an additional pore system into zeolite single crystals, either during the crystallization process of the zeolite crystal or in an already synthesized microporous zeolite (intracrystalline mesopore, Figure 29A), or by a purposeful aggregation of individual zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets (intercrystalline mesopore, Figure 29C,E)."

[4] "The introduced mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for catalytic reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. 

Synthesis methods include:
1. Introducing additional pores into zeolite crystals during crystallization or post-synthesis
2. Aggregating zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets to create intercrystalline mesopores

These hierarchical structures improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites by:
1. Accelerating mass transport 
2. Reducing diffusion path length for reactants
3. Improving accessibility to active sites
4. Facilitating escape of products
5. Increasing reactant conversion and product selectivity
6. Extending catalyst lifetime

The enhanced mass transfer and accessibility provided by the additional meso/macropores, combined with the intrinsic catalytic properties of the micropores, make hierarchical zeolites superior catalysts for reactions involving larger molecules like propane.

分级多孔沸石将微孔与介孔和/或大孔相结合，以增强催化反应(如丙烷脱氢(PDH))的可及性。主要类型有微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。

合成方法包括：
1. 在结晶过程中或合成后向沸石晶体引入额外的孔
2. 聚集沸石纳米晶体或纳米片以形成晶间介孔

与传统沸石相比，这些分级结构通过以下方式改善PDH性能：
1. 加速质量传输
2. 缩短反应物的扩散路径
3. 提高活性位点的可及性
4. 促进产物逸出
5. 提高反应物转化率和产物选择性
6. 延长催化剂寿命

额外的介孔/大孔提供的增强质量传输和可及性，结合微孔的固有催化性质，使分级沸石成为处理丙烷等较大分子反应的优良催化剂。
