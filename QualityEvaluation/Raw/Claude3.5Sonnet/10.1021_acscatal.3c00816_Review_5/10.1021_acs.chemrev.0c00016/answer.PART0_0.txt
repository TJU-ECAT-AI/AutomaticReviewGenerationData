[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "The preparation methods can be divided principally into the post-treatment synthetic routes and the in situ synthetic routes."

[4] "The post-treatment, including the selective desilication/dealumination processes, is mainly a destructive procedure by sacrificing part of the zeolite crystals to create larger meso- or macropores."

[5] "The in situ synthesis approach usually uses the organic or inorganic templates in the zeolite crystallization process."

[6] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions"

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. These can be synthesized through post-treatment methods like selective desilication/dealumination or in situ methods using organic or inorganic templates during zeolite crystallization.

These hierarchical structures improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by providing unimpeded transport paths through macropores, enhanced accessibility to active sites via mesopores, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic activity of the micropores. This combination allows for faster diffusion of reactants and products, reduced mass transfer limitations, and potentially higher catalytic activity and stability. However, the literature does not provide specific performance data for PDH reactions.

分级沸石通过将微孔与介孔和/或大孔相结合，提高了丙烷脱氢(PDH)等反应的可及性。主要类型包括微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。这些可以通过后处理方法(如选择性脱硅/脱铝)或使用有机或无机模板的原位方法在沸石结晶过程中合成。

与传统沸石相比，这些分级结构通过大孔提供无阻碍的传输路径，通过介孔增强了对活性位点的可及性，同时保持了微孔的固有催化活性，从而提高了PDH反应性能。这种组合允许反应物和产物更快的扩散，减少了传质限制，并可能提高催化活性和稳定性。然而，文献中并未提供PDH反应的具体性能数据。
