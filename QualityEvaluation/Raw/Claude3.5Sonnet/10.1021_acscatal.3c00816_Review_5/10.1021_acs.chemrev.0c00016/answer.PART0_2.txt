[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "The in situ approach including hard and soft templating methods can produce ordered micro-mesoporous zeolite materials, which are very hardly obtained with postsynthesis methods."

[4] "The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites due to the improved mass transport and the shortened diffusion path length."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for catalytic reactions like PDH. The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. These can be synthesized using in situ methods like hard and soft templating to produce ordered structures, or post-synthesis methods. 

The additional meso/macropores improve mass transport and shorten diffusion paths compared to traditional microporous zeolites. This results in superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime in reactions. While the literature does not specifically mention PDH reactions, the enhanced accessibility and transport properties of hierarchical zeolites would likely improve their performance in PDH reactions as well by allowing better access of reactants to active sites and faster removal of products.

分级多孔沸石将微孔与介孔和/或大孔结合,以提高催化反应(如PDH反应)的可及性。主要类型包括微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。这些可以通过原位方法(如硬模板和软模板法)合成有序结构,或通过后合成方法制备。

与传统的微孔沸石相比,额外的介孔/大孔改善了物质传输并缩短了扩散路径。这导致了更优越的催化活性、选择性和寿命。虽然文献没有特别提到PDH反应,但分级多孔沸石的增强可及性和传输特性可能会通过允许反应物更好地接触活性位点和更快地去除产物,从而提高PDH反应的性能。
