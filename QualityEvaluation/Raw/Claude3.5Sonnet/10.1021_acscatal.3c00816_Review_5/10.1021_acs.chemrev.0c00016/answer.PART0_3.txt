[1] "Hierarchically porous zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system."

[2] "Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores)."

[3] "Many new approaches, herein classified as either the in situ approach or postsynthetic approach, have been developed."

[4] "The hierarchical zeolite catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites, which is due to their optimal mesopore quality, such as the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores with mesopores and/or macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions. The main types are micro-mesoporous, micro-macroporous, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. Synthesis methods fall into two main categories: in situ approaches and postsynthetic approaches. 

These hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of reactions compared to traditional zeolites by providing enhanced access and transport through the additional meso/macroporous system while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic properties of the micropores. This results in superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime due to optimal mesopore quality including size, distribution, and connectivity within the zeolite crystals.

While the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the principles of improved accessibility and mass transport provided by hierarchical zeolites would likely benefit PDH reactions involving bulky molecules by reducing diffusion limitations.

分级多孔沸石通过将微孔与介孔和/或大孔相结合来增强反应的可及性。主要类型包括微-介孔、微-大孔和微-介-大孔沸石。合成方法主要分为两类：原位法和后合成法。

与传统沸石相比，这些分级多孔沸石通过额外的介孔/大孔系统提供增强的可及性和传输，同时保持微孔的固有催化性能，从而改善了反应性能。由于沸石晶体内最佳的介孔质量，包括尺寸、分布和连通性，这导致了更优越的催化活性、选择性和寿命。

虽然文献中没有具体讨论丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，但分级多孔沸石提供的改善可及性和传质原理可能会通过减少扩散限制而有利于涉及大分子的PDH反应。
