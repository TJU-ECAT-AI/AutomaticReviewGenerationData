[1] "Additionally, Ren et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI."

[2] "Future catalyst design should aim to move away from Cr- and Ga-based catalysts to focus on low-temperature CO2 activation and have controlled redox and acidbase properties."

The literature does not provide specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. There is no detailed discussion of the main types, synthesis methods, or performance improvements of hierarchical zeolites compared to traditional zeolites for PDH reactions. The document only briefly mentions some zeolite supports like silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI being investigated, but does not go into detail about hierarchical structures. More research would be needed to properly answer this question about hierarchical zeolites for PDH catalysis.

文献中没有提供关于层级孔结构沸石如何结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应可及性的具体信息。文中没有详细讨论层级孔结构沸石的主要类型、合成方法,或与传统沸石相比在PDH反应中的性能改进。文献仅简单提到研究了一些沸石载体如硅铝酸盐-1和H[B]MFI,但没有深入探讨层级结构。要正确回答这个关于PDH催化中层级孔结构沸石的问题,还需要更多的研究。
