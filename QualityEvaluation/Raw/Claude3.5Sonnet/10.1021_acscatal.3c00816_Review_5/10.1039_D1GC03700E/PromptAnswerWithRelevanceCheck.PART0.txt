<quotes>

[1] "Zeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3. Zhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness. Although the initial conversion and selectivity was high (48% and 86%, respectively) (Table 11, entry 5), the catalysts deactivated rapidly and the reaction conditions were such that the STY was only 2.5 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 550 C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 2."

[2] "Zhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI. CrOx/H[B]MFI was found to be the most active catalyst, giving a STY of 4.7 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at 600 C with a CO2:C3H8 of 1 (Table 11, entry 15)."

The literature does not provide specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The document only mentions traditional zeolites like ZSM-5 and MFI-type zeolites as supports for chromium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss the synthesis methods or performance improvements of hierarchical zeolites compared to traditional zeolites for PDH reactions. The information provided is insufficient to fully answer the question about hierarchical zeolites in PDH reactions.

这篇文献没有提供关于层级结构沸石如何将微孔和介孔/大孔结合以增强PDH反应可及性的具体信息。文档仅提到了传统的沸石如ZSM-5和MFI型沸石作为丙烷脱氢反应中氧化铬催化剂的载体。它没有讨论层级结构沸石的合成方法或与传统沸石相比在PDH反应中的性能改进。提供的信息不足以全面回答关于PDH反应中层级结构沸石的问题。

[1] "Subsequent studies on a CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction."

[2] "Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before."

[3] "Ren et al. studied the effect of acidity and pore geometry in Ga2O3 supported on ZSM-48 and ZSM-5."

The literature does not provide specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The document mentions some zeolite supports like beta zeolites and ZSM-48/ZSM-5, but does not discuss hierarchical structures or their synthesis methods in detail. There is insufficient information to compare the performance of hierarchical zeolites to traditional zeolites for PDH reactions based on the given text. More specific research on hierarchical zeolites in PDH catalysis would be needed to properly address this question.

[1] "Additionally, Ren et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI."

[2] "Future catalyst design should aim to move away from Cr- and Ga-based catalysts to focus on low-temperature CO2 activation and have controlled redox and acidbase properties."

[1] "Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before."

[2] "It was found that the steam-treated catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the as-prepared catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst."

The provided literature does not contain specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The quotes only mention dealuminated beta zeolites and steam treatment of catalysts, which are not directly related to hierarchical zeolite structures. There is insufficient information to answer the question about types, synthesis methods, and performance improvements of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.
