[1] "Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before."

[2] "It was found that the steam-treated catalyst was initially almost twice as active as the as-prepared catalyst, which leaves the possibility that at higher conversions, increased coke formation may have occurred which would exaggerate the deactivation compared to the steam treated catalyst."

The provided literature does not contain specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The quotes only mention dealuminated beta zeolites and steam treatment of catalysts, which are not directly related to hierarchical zeolite structures. There is insufficient information to answer the question about types, synthesis methods, and performance improvements of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

所提供的文献中没有关于分级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔用于PDH反应的具体信息。引用的内容仅提到了脱铝的β沸石和催化剂的蒸汽处理,这与分级沸石结构并不直接相关。没有足够的信息来回答关于分级沸石用于PDH反应的类型、合成方法以及与传统沸石相比的性能改进等问题。
