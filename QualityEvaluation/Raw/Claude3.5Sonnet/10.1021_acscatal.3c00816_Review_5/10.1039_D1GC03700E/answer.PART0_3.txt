[1] "Recently, Zhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI."

[2] "Zheng et al. investigated ODH-CO2 of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide and found that β-Ga2O3 (Table 12, entry 2) was the most active, even outperforming Cr2O3 at 500 C."

[3] "Ren et al. studied the effect of acidity and pore geometry in Ga2O3 supported on ZSM-48 and ZSM-5."

The literature does not provide specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The quotes mention some zeolite supports like MFI, silicalite-1, H[B]MFI, ZSM-48 and ZSM-5, but do not discuss their hierarchical structures or synthesis methods. There is insufficient information to answer the question about how hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility and improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites.

文献中没有提供关于层级结构沸石如何结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应可及性的具体信息。引用中提到了一些沸石载体如MFI、硅铝酸盐-1、H[B]MFI、ZSM-48和ZSM-5,但并未讨论它们的层级结构或合成方法。没有足够的信息来回答层级结构沸石如何提高可及性以及与传统沸石相比如何改善PDH反应性能的问题。
