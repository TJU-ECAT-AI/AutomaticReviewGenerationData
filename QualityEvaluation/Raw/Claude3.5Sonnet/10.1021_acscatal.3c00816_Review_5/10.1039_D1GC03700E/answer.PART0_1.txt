[1] "Subsequent studies on a CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts (with 12 wt% V loading) modified with Mg revealed the anti-coking capability and improved catalytic performance evident through propene yields of 1927% over a 6 h DDH reaction."

[2] "Dealuminated beta zeolites (Si-beta) are promising catalyst supports due to their high surface area and thermal stability as mentioned before."

[3] "Ren et al. studied the effect of acidity and pore geometry in Ga2O3 supported on ZSM-48 and ZSM-5."

The literature does not provide specific information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The document mentions some zeolite supports like beta zeolites and ZSM-48/ZSM-5, but does not discuss hierarchical structures or their synthesis methods in detail. There is insufficient information to compare the performance of hierarchical zeolites to traditional zeolites for PDH reactions based on the given text. More specific research on hierarchical zeolites in PDH catalysis would be needed to properly address this question.

文献中没有提供关于分级zeolites结合微孔和介孔/大孔用于PDH反应的具体信息。文档提到了一些zeolite载体,如beta zeolites和ZSM-48/ZSM-5,但没有详细讨论分级结构或其合成方法。根据给定的文本,没有足够的信息来比较分级zeolites与传统zeolites在PDH反应中的性能。需要对PDH催化中的分级zeolites进行更具体的研究才能正确回答这个问题。
