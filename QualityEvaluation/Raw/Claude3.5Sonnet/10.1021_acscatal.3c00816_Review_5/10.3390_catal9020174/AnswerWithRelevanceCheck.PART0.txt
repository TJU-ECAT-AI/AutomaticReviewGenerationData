          [1] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites"

[2] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures, an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite"

[3] "The hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets exhibited a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."

[4] "Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON) were synthesized by using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure directing agents (SDAs), respectively."

[5] "The hierarchical structure provided a good benefit for promoting the propylene production, resulting in the suppression of the further oligomerization as a side reaction due to the shortening of the diffusion path length of catalysts."

[6] "Compared to the conventional silicalite-1, the silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."

[7] "The hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets were crystallized from a gel precursor in the absence of aluminum source by following the modified literature procedures"

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network. This combination improves the dispersion of metal species due to an increased number of defect sites and prevents metal aggregation.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites mentioned are hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON). 

The synthesis methods for these materials involve:
1. Using different structure directing agents (SDAs): tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) for hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) for conventional silicalite-1.
2. Crystallizing hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets from a gel precursor in the absence of an aluminum source.

Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:
1. They provide better dispersion of metal species, enhancing catalytic activity.
2. They improve catalytic efficiency, especially for reactions involving bulky molecules.
3. They have a higher total pore volume while maintaining similar micropore volume, indicating the presence of additional meso- and macroporosity.
4. They suppress side reactions such as oligomerization due to shortened diffusion path lengths.
5. They promote propylene production by suppressing further oligomerization as a side reaction.

These benefits result from the combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical structures, which enhance accessibility and improve overall catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

          分级沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。这种组合由于缺陷位点数量的增加而改善了金属物种的分散，并防止金属聚集。

提到的主要分级沸石类型是分级硅酸盐-1纳米片（Si-MFI-NS）和常规硅酸盐-1（Si-MFI-CON）。

这些材料的合成方法包括：
1. 使用不同的结构导向剂（SDAs）：四-（正丁基）膦hydroxide（TBPOH）用于分级硅酸盐-1纳米片，四丙基氢氧化铵（TPAOH）用于常规硅酸盐-1。
2. 在没有铝源的情况下从凝胶前体结晶分级硅酸盐-1纳米片。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下几种方式改善了PDH反应的性能：
1. 它们提供了更好的金属物种分散，从而增强了催化活性。
2. 它们提高了催化效率，特别是对于涉及大分子的反应。
3. 它们具有更高的总孔体积，同时保持类似的微孔体积，表明存在额外的介孔和大孔。
4. 由于扩散路径长度缩短，它们抑制了如寡聚反应等副反应。
5. 它们通过抑制进一步的寡聚作为副反应来促进丙烯的生产。

这些优势源于分级结构中微孔和介孔/大孔的结合，这种结合增强了可及性，并改善了PDH反应的整体催化性能。
