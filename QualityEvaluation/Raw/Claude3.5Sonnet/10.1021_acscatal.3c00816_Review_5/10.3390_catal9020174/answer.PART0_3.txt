[1] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites"

[2] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures, an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite"

[3] "Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON) were synthesized by using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure directing agents (SDAs), respectively."

[4] "The hierarchical structure provided a good benefit for promoting the propylene production, resulting in the suppression of the further oligomerization as a side reaction due to the shortening of the diffusion path length of catalysts."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network. This combination improves the dispersion of metal species due to an increased number of defect sites, preventing metal aggregation.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites mentioned in the text are hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON). The synthesis method described involves using different structure directing agents (SDAs): tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) for hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) for conventional silicalite-1.

Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. They provide improved catalytic efficiency, particularly in processes involving bulky molecules.
2. They promote better propylene production by suppressing side reactions like oligomerization.
3. They shorten the diffusion path length of catalysts, which enhances overall reaction efficiency.
4. They improve the dispersion of metal species, leading to better catalytic performance.

These benefits result in higher selectivity towards propylene and improved catalyst stability in PDH reactions compared to conventional zeolites.

分层沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。这种组合通过增加缺陷位点的数量来改善金属物种的分散，防止金属聚集。

文中提到的主要分层沸石类型是分层硅铝酸盐-1纳米片(Si-MFI-NS)和常规硅铝酸盐-1(Si-MFI-CON)。所描述的合成方法涉及使用不同的结构导向剂(SDAs)：四-(正丁基)膦羟化物(TBPOH)用于分层硅铝酸盐-1纳米片，四丙基氢氧化铵(TPAOH)用于常规硅铝酸盐-1。

与传统沸石相比，分层沸石通过以下几种方式改善PDH反应的性能：

1. 它们提供了improved的催化效率，特别是在涉及大分子的过程中。
2. 它们通过抑制如寡聚等副反应来促进更好的丙烯生产。
3. 它们缩短了催化剂的扩散路径长度，从而提高了整体反应效率。
4. 它们改善了金属物种的分散，导致更好的催化性能。

这些优势导致PDH反应中丙烯的选择性更高，催化剂稳定性更好，相比于常规沸石而言。
