[1] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]."

[2] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."

[3] "Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON) were synthesized by using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure directing agents (SDAs), respectively."

[4] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network. This improves the dispersion of metal species due to an increased number of defect sites. The main types of hierarchical zeolites mentioned in the literature are hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets and conventional silicalite-1.

The synthesis methods for these materials involve using different structure directing agents (SDAs). Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets are synthesized using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH), while conventional silicalite-1 is synthesized using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH).

Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. They provide better dispersion of metal species, which enhances catalytic activity.
2. They improve catalytic efficiency, especially for reactions involving bulky molecules.
3. They suppress side reactions such as oligomerization due to shortened diffusion path lengths.
4. They provide better accessibility to active sites, which can lead to improved selectivity and stability in PDH reactions.

Overall, the hierarchical structure of these zeolites addresses some of the limitations of conventional zeolites in PDH reactions, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。这通过增加缺陷位点的数量来改善金属物种的分散。文献中提到的主要分级沸石类型是分级硅铝石纳米片和常规硅铝石。

这些材料的合成方法涉及使用不同的结构导向剂(SDAs)。分级硅铝石纳米片使用四-(正丁基)膦hydroxide (TBPOH)合成，而常规硅铝石使用四丙基氢氧化铵(TPAOH)合成。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下几种方式改善了PDH反应的性能：

1. 它们提供了更好的金属物种分散，从而增强了催化活性。
2. 它们提高了催化效率，特别是对于涉及大分子的反应。
3. 由于扩散路径长度缩短，它们抑制了如低聚反应等副反应。
4. 它们提供了更好的活性位点可及性，这可以导致PDH反应中选择性和稳定性的提高。

总的来说，这些沸石的分级结构解决了常规沸石在PDH反应中的一些局限性，从而带来了增强的催化性能。
