[1] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites"

[2] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures, an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite"

[3] "Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON) were synthesized by using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure directing agents (SDAs), respectively."

[4] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."

[5] "The hierarchical structure provided a good benefit for promoting the propylene production, resulting in the suppression of the further oligomerization as a side reaction due to the shortening of the diffusion path length of catalysts."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network. This combination improves the dispersion of metal species due to an increased number of defect sites and prevents metal aggregation.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites mentioned in the text are hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON). The synthesis method described involves using different structure-directing agents (SDAs): tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) for hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) for conventional silicalite-1.

Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. They provide better dispersion of metal species, which enhances catalytic efficiency.
2. They suppress side reactions such as oligomerization due to shortened diffusion path lengths.
3. They promote propylene production by suppressing further oligomerization as a side reaction.
4. They improve catalytic efficiency in reactions involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization, and hydrodesulfurization.

These benefits are attributed to the combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores in hierarchical structures, which enhance accessibility and improve overall catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统，将微孔和介孔/大孔相结合，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。这种组合由于缺陷位点数量的增加，改善了金属物种的分散性，并防止金属聚集。

文中提到的主要分级沸石类型是分级硅酸盐-1纳米片(Si-MFI-NS)和传统硅酸盐-1(Si-MFI-CON)。所描述的合成方法涉及使用不同的结构导向剂(SDAs)：四-(正丁基)膦hydroxide (TBPOH)用于分级硅酸盐-1纳米片，四丙基氢氧化铵(TPAOH)用于传统硅酸盐-1。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下几种方式改善PDH反应的性能：

1. 它们提供了更好的金属物种分散，从而提高了催化效率。
2. 由于扩散路径长度缩短，它们抑制了诸如寡聚反应等副反应。
3. 它们通过抑制进一步的寡聚作为副反应来促进丙烯的生产。
4. 它们提高了涉及体积较大分子的反应的催化效率，如异构化、芳构化和脱硫反应。

这些优势归因于分级结构中微孔和介孔/大孔的结合，这种结合增强了可及性，并改善了PDH反应的整体催化性能。
