[1] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites"

[2] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures, an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite"

[3] "The hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets exhibited a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."

[4] "Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON) were synthesized by using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure directing agents (SDAs), respectively."

[5] "Compared to the conventional silicalite-1, the cracked product selectivity over the conventional silicalite-1 was also remarkably increased. This is most likely due to the fact that the formation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage is inevitably excluded using Pt-based catalysts"

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network. This improves the dispersion of metal species due to an increased number of defect sites. The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this literature are hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets.

The synthesis method mentioned involves using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) as a structure directing agent (SDA) for hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets, in contrast to tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) used for conventional silicalite-1.

Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. They provide a higher total pore volume, indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity while maintaining similar micropore volume.

2. They enhance catalytic efficiency, particularly in processes involving bulky molecules.

3. They improve the dispersion of metal species, which helps prevent metal aggregation.

4. They reduce the formation of cracked products, which is a common issue with conventional zeolites in PDH reactions.

Overall, the hierarchical structure provides better accessibility to active sites, improved diffusion of reactants and products, and enhanced stability of the catalyst, leading to superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。这种结构改善了金属物种的分散，因为缺陷位点的数量大大增加。本文献中讨论的主要分级沸石类型是分级硅酸盐-1纳米片。

提到的合成方法涉及使用四-(正丁基)膦氢氧化物(TBPOH)作为分级硅酸盐-1纳米片的结构导向剂(SDA)，而传统的硅酸盐-1则使用四丙基氢氧化铵(TPAOH)。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下几种方式改善了PDH反应的性能：

1. 它们提供了更高的总孔体积，表明存在大量的介孔和大孔，同时保持了类似的微孔体积。

2. 它们增强了催化效率，特别是在涉及大分子的过程中。

3. 它们改善了金属物种的分散，有助于防止金属聚集。

4. 它们减少了裂解产物的形成，这是PDH反应中传统沸石的常见问题。

总的来说，分级结构提供了更好的活性位点可及性，改善了反应物和产物的扩散，并增强了催化剂的稳定性，从而在PDH反应中表现出比传统沸石更优越的性能。
