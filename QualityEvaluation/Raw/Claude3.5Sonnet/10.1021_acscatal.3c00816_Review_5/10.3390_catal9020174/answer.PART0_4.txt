[1] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites"

[2] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures, an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite"

[3] "Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON) were synthesized by using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure directing agents (SDAs), respectively."

[4] "The hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets were crystallized from a gel precursor in the absence of aluminum source by following the modified literature procedures"

[5] "Compared to the conventional silicalite-1, the silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."

[6] "In addition, the hierarchical structure provided a good benefit for promoting the propylene production, resulting in the suppression of the further oligomerization as a side reaction due to the shortening of the diffusion path length of catalysts."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network. This combination improves the dispersion of metal species due to an increased number of defect sites and shortens diffusion path lengths.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this literature are hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS) and conventional silicalite-1 (Si-MFI-CON). The synthesis method for hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets involves using tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) as a structure-directing agent and crystallizing from a gel precursor in the absence of an aluminum source.

Hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. They provide better dispersion of metal species, preventing metal aggregation.
2. They offer improved catalytic efficiency, particularly for reactions involving bulky molecules.
3. They have a higher total pore volume while maintaining similar micropore volume, indicating the presence of additional meso- and macroporosity.
4. They promote propylene production by suppressing further oligomerization as a side reaction due to shortened diffusion path lengths.

These improvements result in enhanced catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions compared to conventional zeolites.

分层沸石通过在微孔沸石网络中引入介孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。这种组合由于缺陷位点数量的增加而改善了金属物种的分散，并缩短了扩散路径长度。

本文献中讨论的主要分层沸石类型是分层硅酸盐-1纳米片（Si-MFI-NS）和常规硅酸盐-1（Si-MFI-CON）。分层硅酸盐-1纳米片的合成方法涉及使用四（正丁基）膦氢氧化物（TBPOH）作为结构导向剂，并在没有铝源的情况下从凝胶前体结晶。

与传统沸石相比，分层沸石通过以下几种方式改善了PDH反应的性能：

1. 它们提供了更好的金属物种分散，防止金属聚集。
2. 它们提供了改进的催化效率，特别是对于涉及大体积分子的反应。
3. 它们具有更高的总孔体积，同时保持类似的微孔体积，表明存在额外的介孔和大孔。
4. 由于扩散路径长度缩短，它们通过抑制进一步的寡聚反应作为副反应来促进丙烯的生产。

这些改进导致PDH反应中的催化活性、选择性和稳定性相比常规沸石得到增强。
