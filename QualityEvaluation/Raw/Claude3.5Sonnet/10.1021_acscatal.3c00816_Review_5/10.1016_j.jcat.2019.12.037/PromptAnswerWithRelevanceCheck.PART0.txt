Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or their performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The document focuses on cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolite structures combining micropores and mesopores/macropores. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于分级沸石、其合成方法或与传统沸石相比在PDH反应中的性能的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了负载在脱铝Beta沸石上的钴催化剂用于丙烷脱氢,但没有涉及结合微孔和介孔/大孔的分级沸石结构。因此,无法根据所提供的文本直接回答这个问题。
