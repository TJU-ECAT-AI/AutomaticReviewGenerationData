The given literature does not contain information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The document focuses on Co-based catalysts supported on BEA zeolites, particularly comparing dealuminated Si-BEA and non-dealuminated BEA supports. It does not discuss hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or their performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有包含关于层级沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔用于PDH反应的信息。该文档主要关注在BEA沸石上负载的钴基催化剂,特别是比较了脱铝的Si-BEA和未脱铝的BEA载体。它没有讨论层级沸石、它们的合成方法,或它们与传统沸石相比在PDH反应中的性能。因此,基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
