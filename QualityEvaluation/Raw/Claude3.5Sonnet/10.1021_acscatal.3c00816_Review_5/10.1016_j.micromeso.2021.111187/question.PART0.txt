I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Highlights
•
Effect of hydrogen pre-reduction on Co@MCM-41-catalyzed propane dehydrogenation was studied.
•
Multi-stage migration of framework Co2+ to extra-framework Co0 species occurs in the pre-reduction.
•
Small-size Co0 cluster with moderate Co-silica interaction shows optimal catalytic performance.
•
Framework Co2+ ion with strong interaction with silica support shows low intrinsic activity.
•
Large Co particle with weak Co-silica interaction shows low propylene selectivity and severe coke issue.
Abstract
Co@MCM41 catalysts with and without hydrogen prereduction treatments are prepared for catalyzing nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene. Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction. The location and chemical states of Co species in catalysts are related to the prereduction temperature and time duration. The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and smallsize Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst. A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition. Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions, what are the main types and synthesis methods of these materials, and how do they improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
