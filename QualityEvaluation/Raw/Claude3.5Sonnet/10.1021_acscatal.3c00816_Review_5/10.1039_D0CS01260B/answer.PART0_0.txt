[1] "To further improve the anti-coking stability of CrZrOx catalysts in the PDH reactions, the modification with combined basic Cs and acidic P promoters is proved useful to inhibit the oligomerization of two neighboring propylenes by isolating the active sites."

[2] "Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structureproperty relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acidbase property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions."

[3] "Considering that the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."

[4] "The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-scale porous structure. The main types include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. Common synthesis methods include templating approaches, post-synthesis treatments, and direct synthesis strategies.

Some key methods for creating hierarchical zeolites include:

1. Templating: Using surfactants, polymers, or carbon materials as templates to create mesopores/macropores during zeolite synthesis.

2. Desilication: Selectively removing silicon from the zeolite framework to create mesopores.

3. Dealumination: Selectively removing aluminum to create mesopores.

4. Recrystallization: Partial dissolution and recrystallization to generate mesopores.

5. Nanosized zeolite assembly: Assembling nanosized zeolite crystals to form intercrystalline mesopores.

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Enhanced mass transfer: The additional meso/macropores facilitate diffusion of reactants and products.

2. Increased accessibility: More active sites become accessible to reactants.

3. Improved catalyst stability: Faster diffusion of coke precursors out of the zeolite reduces coking.

4. Higher metal dispersion: The hierarchical structure allows better dispersion of metal active sites.

5. Tunable acidity: The hierarchical structure allows for better control over zeolite acidity.

As shown in the literature, hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites demonstrated 26 times higher conversion and 10-100% increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalysts in PDH reactions. This significant improvement highlights the potential of hierarchical zeolites in enhancing catalytic performance for dehydrogenation reactions.

分级沸石通过创建多尺度孔结构来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以提高PDH反应的可及性。主要类型包括介孔沸石、大孔沸石和微-介-大孔沸石。常见的合成方法包括模板法、后合成处理和直接合成策略。

创建分级沸石的一些关键方法包括：

1. 模板法：使用表面活性剂、聚合物或碳材料作为模板，在沸石合成过程中创建介孔/大孔。

2. 脱硅：选择性地从沸石骨架中去除硅以创建介孔。

3. 脱铝：选择性地去除铝以创建介孔。

4. 重结晶：部分溶解和重结晶以生成介孔。

5. 纳米级沸石组装：组装纳米级沸石晶体以形成晶间介孔。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石在以下几个方面改善了PDH性能：

1. 增强质量传递：额外的介孔/大孔促进了反应物和产物的扩散。

2. 提高可及性：更多的活性位点变得可及于反应物。

3. 提高催化剂稳定性：焦炭前体更快地从沸石中扩散出去，减少了结焦。

4. 更高的金属分散度：分级结构允许更好地分散金属活性位点。

5. 可调酸度：分级结构允许更好地控制沸石酸度。

正如文献所示，在PDH反应中，分级Ga-MFI沸石与块状Ga-MFI催化剂相比，转化率提高了26倍，丙烯选择性提高了10-100%。这种显著的改进突出了分级沸石在提高脱氢反应催化性能方面的潜力。
