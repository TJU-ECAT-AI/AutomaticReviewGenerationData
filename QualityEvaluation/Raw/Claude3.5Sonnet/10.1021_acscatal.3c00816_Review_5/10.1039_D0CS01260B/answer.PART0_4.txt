[1] "The hierarchical pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite can decrease the acid content of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, greatly improving the capacity for coke accommodation and modifying the migration process of coke from the active metal sites to the supports."

[2] "For instance, the mesoporous SBA-15-supported 3 nm Pt nanoparticles display higher propane conversion and coke amount but lower propylene selectivity than the supported 21 nm particles."

[3] "The dealuminated beta zeolite consists of a large amount of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, providing the hostguest interaction for constraining massive small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the zeolite frameworks rather than being located on the external surfaces."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions in several ways:

1. They decrease the acid content of the catalyst, which improves coke accommodation capacity and modifies coke migration.

2. They provide better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles within the pore structure.

3. They offer increased surface area and more accessible active sites compared to traditional zeolites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites used for PDH include ZSM-5, beta zeolite, and SBA-15. Common synthesis methods involve dealumination, desilication, and templating approaches.

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Enhancing mass transfer and reducing diffusion limitations
2. Providing better control over acid site distribution 
3. Allowing for higher metal loadings and improved dispersion
4. Increasing catalyst lifetime by accommodating more coke
5. Offering tunable pore structures to optimize reactant/product diffusion

However, the specific impacts on conversion and selectivity can vary depending on the zeolite type and metal species used. Careful optimization is needed to balance the benefits of hierarchical structures with potential drawbacks like decreased microporosity or altered acidity.

分级沸石通过以下几种方式结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性:

1. 它们降低了催化剂的酸含量,这改善了焦炭容纳能力并修改了焦炭从活性金属位点到载体的迁移过程。

2. 它们为金属纳米颗粒在孔结构内提供了更好的分散和稳定性。

3. 与传统沸石相比,它们提供了更大的比表面积和更多可接近的活性位点。

用于PDH的主要分级沸石类型包括ZSM-5、β沸石和SBA-15。常见的合成方法包括脱铝、脱硅和模板法。

与传统沸石相比,分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH性能:

1. 增强传质并减少扩散限制
2. 更好地控制酸位分布 
3. 允许更高的金属负载量和改善分散性
4. 通过容纳更多焦炭来延长催化剂寿命
5. 提供可调节的孔结构以优化反应物/产物扩散

然而,对转化率和选择性的具体影响可能因所使用的沸石类型和金属物种而异。需要仔细优化以平衡分级结构的优势与潜在的缺点,如微孔度降低或酸度改变。
