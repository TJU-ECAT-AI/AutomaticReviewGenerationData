[1] "Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structureproperty relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acidbase property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions."

[2] "The layered MgAl hydroxides supported on Al2O3 allow the chloroplatinate complex to exchange with their interlayer anions, resulting in the predominant localization of the dispersed Pt sites in the MgAl phase for better anti-coking stability of the Pt catalyst in the PDH reaction."

[3] "A composite catalyst, MgAl-LDHs/Al2O3 fiber, also shows a good PDH performance due to the LDH sheet-promoted dispersion state of active Pt sites and open pore structure."

[4] "To further improve the anti-coking stability of CrZrOx catalysts in the PDH reactions, the modification with combined basic Cs and acidic P promoters is proved useful to inhibit the oligomerization of two neighboring propylenes by isolating the active sites."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The larger meso/macropores facilitate faster diffusion of reactants and products, while micropores provide high surface area for catalytic reactions.

2. Enhanced dispersion of active sites: The hierarchical structure allows better dispersion and accessibility of active metal sites throughout the zeolite framework.

3. Reduced coke formation: Larger pores help mitigate coke deposition and pore blockage, improving catalyst stability.

4. Tunable acidity: The combination of different pore sizes allows for control over the type, strength and distribution of acid sites.

Main types of hierarchical zeolites include:

1. Mesoporous zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores
2. Nanosized zeolite crystals assembled into mesoporous structures  
3. Zeolite-based composite materials with intercrystalline mesoporosity

Common synthesis methods include:

1. Post-synthesis dealumination or desilication 
2. Use of mesopore-directing agents during synthesis
3. Hard or soft templating approaches
4. Assembly of nanozeolites

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites typically show:

1. Higher catalytic activity due to improved accessibility 
2. Better selectivity from optimized pore structure
3. Enhanced stability and longer lifetime from reduced coking
4. Improved heat/mass transfer properties

While the literature does not provide specific performance comparisons for PDH reactions, hierarchical zeolites generally enable significant improvements in catalytic efficiency, stability and product selectivity for various catalytic processes including dehydrogenation reactions.
