[1] "To further improve the anti-coking stability of CrZrOx catalysts in the PDH reactions, the modification with combined basic Cs and acidic P promoters is proved useful to inhibit the oligomerization of two neighboring propylenes by isolating the active sites."

[2] "Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structureproperty relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acidbase property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions."

[3] "Considering that the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."

[4] "The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-scale porous structure. The main types include mesoporous zeolites, macroporous zeolites, and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. Common synthesis methods include templating approaches, post-synthesis treatments, and direct synthesis strategies.

Some key methods for creating hierarchical zeolites include:

1. Templating: Using surfactants, polymers, or carbon materials as templates to create mesopores/macropores during zeolite synthesis.

2. Desilication: Selectively removing silicon from the zeolite framework to create mesopores.

3. Dealumination: Selectively removing aluminum to create mesopores.

4. Recrystallization: Partial dissolution and recrystallization to generate mesopores.

5. Nanosized zeolite assembly: Assembling nanosized zeolite crystals to form intercrystalline mesopores.

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Enhanced mass transfer: The additional meso/macropores facilitate diffusion of reactants and products.

2. Increased accessibility: More active sites become accessible to reactants.

3. Improved catalyst stability: Faster diffusion of coke precursors out of the zeolite reduces coking.

4. Higher metal dispersion: The hierarchical structure allows better dispersion of metal active sites.

5. Tunable acidity: The hierarchical structure allows for better control over zeolite acidity.

As shown in the literature, hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites demonstrated 26 times higher conversion and 10-100% increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalysts in PDH reactions. This significant improvement highlights the potential of hierarchical zeolites in enhancing catalytic performance for dehydrogenation reactions.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-scale porous structure. This structure improves mass transfer and diffusion of reactants and products, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic properties of the zeolite.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores
2. Nanosized zeolite crystals
3. Zeolites with intercrystalline mesopores

Common synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Templating methods (e.g., using surfactants or polymers)
2. Post-synthesis treatments (e.g., desilication, dealumination)
3. Direct synthesis methods (e.g., using specially designed structure-directing agents)

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:
1. Enhanced accessibility to active sites
2. Improved diffusion of reactants and products
3. Reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability
4. Higher conversion rates and selectivity
5. Better dispersion of active metal species

These improvements result in significantly higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. For example, hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts showed 26 times higher conversion and 10-100% increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalysts. Additionally, hierarchical structures can improve the capacity for coke accommodation and modify the migration process of coke from active metal sites to supports, further enhancing catalyst longevity.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-level porous structure. This structure allows for improved mass transfer and diffusion of reactants and products, while maintaining the high surface area and shape selectivity of traditional zeolites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:

1. Mesoporous zeolites: These contain both micropores and mesopores within the zeolite crystal structure.

2. Macroporous zeolites: These contain larger pores in addition to the micropores.

3. Hierarchical zeolite composites: These combine zeolites with other porous materials to create a hierarchical structure.

Synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites include:

1. Template-based methods: Using soft or hard templates to create additional porosity during zeolite synthesis.

2. Post-synthesis treatments: Dealumination, desilication, or acid/base treatments to create mesopores in existing zeolites.

3. Top-down approaches: Assembling pre-formed zeolite nanocrystals into hierarchical structures.

4. Bottom-up approaches: Controlling crystal growth to form hierarchical structures directly during synthesis.

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Enhanced accessibility: Larger pores facilitate the transport of bulky molecules, reducing diffusion limitations.

2. Increased active site exposure: More external surface area allows for better dispersion and accessibility of active metal sites.

3. Improved mass transfer: The interconnected pore system enables faster diffusion of reactants and products.

4. Reduced coke formation: Larger pores help prevent pore blockage by coke deposits, extending catalyst lifetime.

5. Better heat transfer: Improved thermal conductivity can help maintain uniform temperature distribution in the catalyst bed.

6. Higher stability: The hierarchical structure can provide better resistance to deactivation and sintering of active metal particles.

These improvements lead to higher catalytic activity, better selectivity, and longer catalyst lifetimes in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.
