          "The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst."

"Considering that the hierarchical pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite can decrease the acid content of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, greatly improving the capacity for coke accommodation and modifying the migration process of coke from the active metal sites to the supports."

"The hierarchical pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite can decrease the acid content of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, greatly improving the capacity for coke accommodation and modifying the migration process of coke from the active metal sites to the supports."

"For instance, the mesoporous SBA-15-supported 3 nm Pt nanoparticles display higher propane conversion and coke amount but lower propylene selectivity than the supported 21 nm particles."

"The dealuminated beta zeolite consists of a large amount of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, providing the hostguest interaction for constraining massive small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the zeolite frameworks rather than being located on the external surfaces."

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-scale porous structure. This structure improves mass transfer, diffusion of reactants and products, and maintains the intrinsic catalytic properties of the zeolite.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Mesoporous zeolites (e.g., hierarchical ZSM-5)
2. Macroporous zeolites
3. Hierarchical zeolite composites (e.g., SBA-15 supported catalysts)
4. Dealuminated zeolites (e.g., beta zeolite)

Common synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Repetitive branching synthesis strategy
2. Utilization of long chain alkyl structure-directing agents
3. Post-synthesis treatments (e.g., dealumination)
4. Templating methods

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:
1. Enhanced accessibility to active sites
2. Improved diffusion of reactants and products
3. Reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability
4. Higher conversion rates and selectivity
5. Better dispersion of active metal species
6. Decreased acid content, leading to improved coke accommodation
7. Modified migration process of coke from active metal sites to supports

These improvements result in significantly higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. For example, hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts showed 26 times higher conversion and 10-100% increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalysts. However, the specific impacts on conversion and selectivity can vary depending on the zeolite type and metal species used, requiring careful optimization to balance the benefits of hierarchical structures with potential drawbacks.

          分级沸石通过创建多尺度孔结构来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。这种结构改善了质量传递、反应物和产物的扩散，同时保持了沸石的固有催化性能。

分级沸石的主要类型包括：
1. 介孔沸石（如分级ZSM-5）
2. 大孔沸石
3. 分级沸石复合材料（如SBA-15负载的催化剂）
4. 脱铝沸石（如β沸石）

分级沸石的常用合成方法包括：
1. 重复分支合成策略
2. 使用长链烷基结构导向剂
3. 后合成处理（如脱铝）
4. 模板法

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石在多个方面改善了PDH反应性能：
1. 提高了活性位点的可及性
2. 改善了反应物和产物的扩散
3. 减少了积碳形成，提高了催化剂稳定性
4. 更高的转化率和选择性
5. 更好地分散活性金属物种
6. 降低酸含量，导致改善积碳容纳能力
7. 修改了积碳从活性金属位点向载体迁移的过程

这些改进导致PDH反应中的催化活性、选择性和稳定性显著提高。例如，分级Ga-MFI沸石催化剂与块状Ga-MFI催化剂相比，转化率提高了26倍，丙烯选择性提高了10-100%。然而，对转化率和选择性的具体影响可能因所使用的沸石类型和金属物种而异，需要仔细优化以平衡分级结构的优势与潜在的缺点。
