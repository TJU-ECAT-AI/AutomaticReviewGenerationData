[1] "To further improve the anti-coking stability of CrZrOx catalysts in the PDH reactions, the modification with combined basic Cs and acidic P promoters is proved useful to inhibit the oligomerization of two neighboring propylenes by isolating the active sites."

[2] "Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structureproperty relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acidbase property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions."

[3] "The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst."

[4] "Considering that the hierarchical pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite can decrease the acid content of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, greatly improving the capacity for coke accommodation and modifying the migration process of coke from the active metal sites to the supports."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a multi-scale porous structure. This structure improves mass transfer and diffusion of reactants and products, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic properties of the zeolite.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores
2. Nanosized zeolite crystals
3. Zeolites with intercrystalline mesopores

Common synthesis methods for hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Templating methods (e.g., using surfactants or polymers)
2. Post-synthesis treatments (e.g., desilication, dealumination)
3. Direct synthesis methods (e.g., using specially designed structure-directing agents)

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:
1. Enhanced accessibility to active sites
2. Improved diffusion of reactants and products
3. Reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability
4. Higher conversion rates and selectivity
5. Better dispersion of active metal species

These improvements result in significantly higher catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. For example, hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts showed 26 times higher conversion and 10-100% increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalysts. Additionally, hierarchical structures can improve the capacity for coke accommodation and modify the migration process of coke from active metal sites to supports, further enhancing catalyst longevity.

分级沸石通过创建多尺度孔结构来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。这种结构改善了反应物和产物的质量传递和扩散，同时保持了沸石的固有催化性能。

分级沸石的主要类型包括：
1. 具有晶内介孔的沸石
2. 纳米尺寸沸石晶体
3. 具有晶间介孔的沸石

分级沸石的常用合成方法包括：
1. 模板法（例如，使用表面活性剂或聚合物）
2. 后合成处理（例如，脱硅、脱铝）
3. 直接合成法（例如，使用特殊设计的结构导向剂）

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石在多个方面改善了PDH反应性能：
1. 提高了活性位点的可及性
2. 改善了反应物和产物的扩散
3. 减少了积碳形成，提高了催化剂稳定性
4. 更高的转化率和选择性
5. 更好地分散活性金属物种

这些改进导致PDH反应中的催化活性、选择性和稳定性显著提高。例如，分级Ga-MFI沸石催化剂与块状Ga-MFI催化剂相比，转化率提高了26倍，丙烯选择性提高了10-100%。此外，分级结构可以改善积碳容纳能力，并修改积碳从活性金属位点向载体迁移的过程，进一步延长催化剂寿命。
