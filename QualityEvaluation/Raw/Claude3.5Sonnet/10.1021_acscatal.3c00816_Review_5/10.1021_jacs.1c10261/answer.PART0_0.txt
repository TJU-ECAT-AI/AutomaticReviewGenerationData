The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores, types and synthesis methods, or their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The document appears to be focused on a specific study involving isolated Pt atoms in dealuminated zeolite Beta for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolites or their properties. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献中不包含有关分级沸石、其微孔和介孔/大孔的组合、类型和合成方法，或它们与传统沸石相比在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能的任何信息。该文档似乎专注于涉及脱铝Beta沸石中孤立Pt原子进行丙烷脱氢的具体研究，但未讨论分级沸石或其性质。因此，无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
