The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their structure combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, types and synthesis methods, or their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The document appears to be a title and author list for a research article on a different topic related to ZnOx/Silicalite-1 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Without additional content from the full article, it is not possible to answer the question based on this limited information.
