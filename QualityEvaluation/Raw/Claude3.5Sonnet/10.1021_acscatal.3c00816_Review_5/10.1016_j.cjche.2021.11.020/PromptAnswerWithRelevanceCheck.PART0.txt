[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 with microporosity and mesoporosity was prepared by a typical desilication process, which is carried out by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition"

[2] "The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the presence of mesopore in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore structure. The main synthesis method mentioned is desilication, which involves treating ZSM-5 zeolite with NaOH solution under mild conditions to create mesopores while preserving the microporous structure.

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance in several ways:

1. Confinement effect: Mesopores allow PtSn particles to be confined within them, stabilizing the catalytic particles and maintaining their activity at high temperatures.

2. Enhanced diffusion: Mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing propane to access PtSn particles more easily and propylene to exit the zeolite crystal faster.

3. Reduced side reactions: Faster diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite structure decreases cracking reactions and coke formation.

4. Improved conversion: The enhanced accessibility of reactants to catalytic sites leads to higher propane conversion.

Compared to traditional zeolites, hierarchical zeolites offer better catalyst stability, higher conversion rates, and improved selectivity in PDH reactions due to their optimized pore structure.

分级沸石通过提供双孔结构来结合微孔和介孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。文中提到的主要合成方法是脱硅，即在温和条件下用NaOH溶液处理ZSM-5沸石，创造介孔的同时保留微孔结构。

这些分级沸石通过以下几种方式改善PDH反应性能：

1. 限域效应：介孔允许PtSn颗粒被限制在其中，稳定催化颗粒并在高温下保持其活性。

2. 增强扩散：介孔加速扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触到PtSn颗粒，丙烯也能更快地从沸石晶体中逸出。

3. 减少副反应：丙烯从沸石结构中更快的扩散降低了裂解反应和积碳形成。

4. 提高转化率：反应物更容易接触到催化位点，从而提高丙烷转化率。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石由于其优化的孔结构，在PDH反应中提供了更好的催化剂稳定性、更高的转化率和更好的选择性。

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Confinement effect: The mesopores can confine and stabilize PtSn catalyst particles, allowing them to remain stable at high temperatures during the reaction.

2. Enhanced diffusion: Mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing propane to access catalyst sites more easily and propylene to diffuse out faster. This enhances propane conversion and reduces side reactions like cracking and coking.

3. Catalyst stability: The hierarchical structure helps maintain catalyst stability over longer periods.

4. Higher conversion and selectivity: The improved accessibility and diffusion lead to higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.

Overall, the combination of micropores and mesopores in hierarchical zeolites addresses limitations of traditional zeolites by improving mass transfer, catalyst stability, and reaction efficiency in PDH reactions.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a dual pore system. The main synthesis method discussed in this literature is desilication, which involves treating conventional ZSM-5 zeolites with NaOH solution under mild conditions. This process creates mesopores while preserving the original microporous structure.

The hierarchical structure improves PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. It allows for confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores, which stabilizes the catalytic sites.

2. It accelerates diffusion rates, allowing propane to more easily access the active sites.

3. It facilitates faster diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal, reducing unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking.

These benefits result in enhanced propane conversion, improved propylene selectivity, and better catalyst stability compared to conventional microporous zeolites.
