[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 with microporosity and mesoporosity was prepared by a typical desilication process, which is carried out by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition"

[2] "The treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite with NaOH solution at a low concentration of 0.2 mol·L-1 leads to an increase of surface area to 294 m2·g1 and total pore volume to 0.17 cm3·g1."

[3] "The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the presence of mesopore in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure."

[5] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by creating a dual pore system. The main synthesis method discussed in this literature is desilication, which involves treating conventional ZSM-5 zeolites with NaOH solution under mild conditions. This process creates mesopores while preserving the original microporous structure.

The hierarchical structure improves PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. It allows for confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores, which stabilizes the catalytic sites.

2. It accelerates diffusion rates, allowing propane to more easily access the active sites.

3. It facilitates faster diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal, reducing unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking.

These benefits result in enhanced propane conversion, improved propylene selectivity, and better catalyst stability compared to conventional microporous zeolites.

分级沸石通过创建双孔系统来结合微孔和介孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。本文献中讨论的主要合成方法是脱硅，即在温和条件下用NaOH溶液处理常规ZSM-5沸石。这个过程创造了介孔，同时保留了原有的微孔结构。

与传统沸石相比，分级结构通过以下几种方式改善了PDH反应性能：

1. 它允许将PtSn颗粒限制在介孔中，从而稳定了催化位点。

2. 它加速了扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触到活性位点。

3. 它促进了丙烯更快地从沸石晶体中扩散出来，减少了不需要的副反应，如裂解和结焦。

这些优势导致了丙烷转化率的提高、丙烯选择性的改善以及与传统微孔沸石相比更好的催化剂稳定性。
