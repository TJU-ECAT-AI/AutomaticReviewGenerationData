[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 with microporosity and mesoporosity was prepared by a typical desilication process, which is carried out by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition"

[2] "The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the presence of mesopore in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing mesopores into the microporous zeolite structure. The main synthesis method described in this literature is desilication, which involves treating ZSM-5 zeolite with NaOH solution under mild conditions. 

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in two main ways:

1. Confinement effect: The mesopores allow PtSn particles to be confined within the zeolite structure, stabilizing them and enabling them to remain stable at high temperatures during the PDH reaction.

2. Enhanced diffusion: The mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing propane to access PtSn particles more easily for the dehydrogenation reaction, thus enhancing propane conversion. Additionally, the faster diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal leads to decreased cracking reactions and coke formation.

These advantages result in higher catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional microporous zeolites.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石结构中引入介孔来提高PDH反应的可及性。本文献中描述的主要合成方法是脱硅，即在温和条件下用NaOH溶液处理ZSM-5沸石。

与传统沸石相比，这些分级沸石通过以下两种主要方式改善PDH反应性能：

1. 限域效应：介孔允许PtSn颗粒被限制在沸石结构内，使其稳定并能在PDH反应的高温下保持稳定。

2. 增强扩散：介孔加速扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触到PtSn颗粒进行脱氢反应，从而提高丙烷转化率。此外，丙烯从沸石晶体中更快的扩散出来，导致裂化反应和积碳形成减少。

这些优势使得分级沸石在丙烷脱氢方面表现出比传统微孔沸石更高的催化性能。
