[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 with microporosity and mesoporosity was prepared by a typical desilication process, which is carried out by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition"

[2] "The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the presence of mesopore in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by introducing mesopores into the microporous zeolite structure. The main synthesis method discussed in this literature is desilication, which involves treating ZSM-5 zeolite with NaOH solution under mild conditions. This creates a hierarchical structure with both micropores and mesopores.

The hierarchical structure improves PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in two main ways:

1. Confinement effect: The mesopores can confine and stabilize PtSn catalyst particles, allowing them to remain stable at high temperatures during the PDH reaction.

2. Enhanced diffusion: The mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing propane to more easily access the catalyst sites and propylene to more quickly diffuse out of the zeolite. This enhances propane conversion and reduces unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking.

These benefits result in higher catalytic activity, improved selectivity, and better stability compared to traditional microporous zeolites for PDH reactions.

分级沸石通过在微孔沸石结构中引入介孔来提高PDH反应的可及性。本文献中讨论的主要合成方法是脱硅，即在温和条件下用NaOH溶液处理ZSM-5沸石。这创造了一个同时具有微孔和介孔的分级结构。

与传统沸石相比，分级结构通过两种主要方式改善了PDH反应性能：

1. 限域效应：介孔可以限制和稳定PtSn催化剂颗粒，使它们在PDH反应的高温下保持稳定。

2. 增强扩散：介孔加速扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触到催化剂位点，丙烯也能更快地从沸石中扩散出来。这提高了丙烷转化率，并减少了不需要的副反应，如裂化和结焦。

这些优势使得分级沸石在PDH反应中表现出更高的催化活性、更好的选择性和更好的稳定性，相比传统的微孔沸石。
