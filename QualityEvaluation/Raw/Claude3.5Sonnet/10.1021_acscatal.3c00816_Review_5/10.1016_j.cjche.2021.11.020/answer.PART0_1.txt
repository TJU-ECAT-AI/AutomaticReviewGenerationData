[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 with microporosity and mesoporosity was prepared by a typical desilication process, which is carried out by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition"

[2] "The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the presence of mesopore in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. The mesopores play two positive roles in the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Firstly, the PtSn particles can be confined in the mesopore of hierarchical ZSM-5, and the confinement effect of mesopores enable to stabilize the PtSn particles in hierarchical ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, these PtSn particles can keep stable in the propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

[4] "Secondly, the presence of mesopores is helpful to accelerate the diffusion rate. The propane can easily access to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing propane conversion. Also, the diffusion of propylene out of zeolite crystal becomes fast, which leads to a decrease of cracking reaction and coking formation."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore structure. The main synthesis method discussed is desilication, where ZSM-5 zeolite is treated with NaOH solution to create mesopores while maintaining the microporous structure.

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Confinement effect: The mesopores can confine and stabilize PtSn catalyst particles, allowing them to remain stable at high temperatures during the reaction.

2. Enhanced diffusion: Mesopores accelerate diffusion rates, allowing propane to access catalyst sites more easily and propylene to diffuse out faster. This enhances propane conversion and reduces side reactions like cracking and coking.

3. Catalyst stability: The hierarchical structure helps maintain catalyst stability over longer periods.

4. Higher conversion and selectivity: The improved accessibility and diffusion lead to higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to traditional zeolites.

Overall, the combination of micropores and mesopores in hierarchical zeolites addresses limitations of traditional zeolites by improving mass transfer, catalyst stability, and reaction efficiency in PDH reactions.

分级沸石通过提供双孔结构来结合微孔和介孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。讨论的主要合成方法是脱硅，即用NaOH溶液处理ZSM-5沸石，在保持微孔结构的同时创造介孔。

这些分级沸石相比传统沸石在多个方面改善了PDH反应性能：

1. 限域效应：介孔可以限制和稳定PtSn催化剂颗粒，使它们在反应的高温下保持稳定。

2. 增强扩散：介孔加速扩散速率，使丙烷更容易接触催化位点，丙烯更快地扩散出来。这提高了丙烷转化率并减少了副反应，如裂解和结焦。

3. 催化剂稳定性：分级结构有助于在较长时间内保持催化剂稳定性。

4. 更高的转化率和选择性：改善的可及性和扩散导致比传统沸石更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

总的来说，分级沸石中微孔和介孔的结合通过改善质量传递、催化剂稳定性和反应效率，解决了传统沸石在PDH反应中的局限性。
