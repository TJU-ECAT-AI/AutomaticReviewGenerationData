[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."

[2] "For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates"

[3] "Under the same testing conditions, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, which are much higher than those of the counterpart with parent microporous ZSM-5 (30% propane conversion and 65% propylene selectivity)."

[4] "The self-assembly is another efficient strategy to build hierarchical zeolites, which can be achieved via enwrapping zeolite crystals with the OMS through stepwise synthesis."

[5] "The hierarchical Ga-MFI catalysts possess lower concentrations of Bronsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, with significant concentrations of strong Lewis acid sites. The catalyst with more MPS additions possesses stronger Lewis acid sites and smaller Bronsted acid/Lewis acid ratios, leading to an improved PDH performance."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by integrating the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network. This combination achieves enhanced micropore accessibility without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect of micropores.

The main types and synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions include:

1. Mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly
2. 2D/layered zeolites synthesized using bifunctional surfactants
3. Pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates
4. Self-assembly method involving enwrapping zeolite crystals with ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) through stepwise synthesis

Hierarchical zeolites significantly improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. For example, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, which are much higher than those of the counterpart with parent microporous ZSM-5 (30% propane conversion and 65% propylene selectivity).

Additionally, hierarchical zeolites can be tailored to possess specific acid site distributions, such as lower concentrations of Bronsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, leading to improved PDH performance. The ability to control the ratio of Bronsted to Lewis acid sites and the strength of these sites further contributes to enhanced catalytic activity in PDH reactions.

分级沸石通过将沸石的固有微孔与辅助介孔/大孔网络相结合，来增强PDH反应的可及性。这种组合实现了增强的微孔可及性，同时不牺牲微孔的固有限制效应。

用于PDH反应的主要分级沸石类型和合成方法包括：

1. 通过脱硅或自组装制备的介孔沸石
2. 使用双功能表面活性剂合成的2D/层状沸石
3. 使用TPAOH和TBPOH作为共模板合成的柱状沸石
4. 通过分步合成将沸石晶体包裹在有序介孔二氧化硅（OMS）中的自组装方法

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石显著改善了PDH反应的性能。例如，负载在分级ZSM-5上的PtSn表现出50%的初始丙烷转化率和95%的丙烯选择性，远高于负载在母体微孔ZSM-5上的对应物（30%的丙烷转化率和65%的丙烯选择性）。

此外，分级沸石可以被调整以具有特定的酸位分布，如较低浓度的布朗斯特酸位和更多的路易斯酸位，从而提高PDH性能。控制布朗斯特酸位与路易斯酸位的比例以及这些酸位强度的能力进一步提高了PDH反应的催化活性。

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network in addition to the intrinsic micropores of zeolites. This combination achieves improved micropore accessibility without sacrificing the confinement effect of micropores.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions include:
1. Mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly
2. 2D/layered zeolites synthesized using bifunctional surfactants
3. Pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates

These materials are synthesized through various methods such as desilication, self-assembly, use of bifunctional surfactants, and templating with specific agents like TPAOH and TBPOH.

Hierarchical zeolites significantly improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. For example, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 showed much higher initial propane conversion (50% vs 30%) and propylene selectivity (95% vs 65%) compared to the parent microporous ZSM-5. Additionally, a Pt catalyst supported on hierarchical S-1 exhibited a much higher Pt-related turnover frequency (1112.2 h-1) compared to the catalyst with bulk S-1 supports (157.6 h-1). These improvements can be attributed to the enhanced accessibility and better diffusion properties provided by the hierarchical structure.

Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores with mesopores/macropores. This combination maintains the confinement effect of micropores while improving overall accessibility through the larger pores.

The main types and synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites for PDH include:
1. Mesoporous zeolites prepared by desilication or self-assembly
2. 2D/layered zeolites synthesized using bifunctional surfactants
3. Pillared zeolites made with TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates

Hierarchical zeolites significantly improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites. For example, PtSn on hierarchical ZSM-5 showed much higher propane conversion (50% vs 30%) and propylene selectivity (95% vs 65%) compared to microporous ZSM-5. Similarly, Pt on hierarchical S-1 exhibited a much higher turnover frequency (1112.2 h-1) than on bulk S-1 (157.6 h-1).
