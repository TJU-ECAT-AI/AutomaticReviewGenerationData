[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."

[2] "For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates"

[3] "Under the same testing conditions, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, which are much higher than those of the counterpart with parent microporous ZSM-5 (30% propane conversion and 65% propylene selectivity)."

[4] "The hierarchical Pt/hierarchical S-1 catalyst exhibits a higher Pt-related TOF of 1112.2 h1 than the catalyst with bulk S-1 supports (TOF is 157.6 h1)."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by incorporating an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network into the intrinsic microporous structure of zeolites. This combination achieves improved micropore accessibility while maintaining the confinement effect of micropores.

The main types and synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites for PDH reactions include:

1. Mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly
2. 2D/layered zeolites synthesized using bifunctional surfactants
3. Pillared zeolites synthesized with TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates

Hierarchical zeolites significantly improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites. For example, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 shows much higher propane conversion (50% vs 30%) and propylene selectivity (95% vs 65%) compared to microporous ZSM-5. Additionally, hierarchical S-1 supported catalysts exhibit a substantially higher turnover frequency (TOF) than bulk S-1 supported catalysts (1112.2 h-1 vs 157.6 h-1). These improvements can be attributed to the enhanced accessibility and better dispersion of active sites in hierarchical zeolites.

分级沸石通过在固有的微孔结构中引入辅助介孔/大孔网络，来结合微孔和介孔/大孔以提高PDH反应的可及性。这种组合实现了改进的微孔可及性，同时保持了微孔的限域效应。

用于PDH反应的分级沸石的主要类型和合成方法包括：

1. 通过脱硅或自组装制备的介孔沸石
2. 使用双功能表面活性剂合成的2D/层状沸石
3. 使用TPAOH和TBPOH作为共模板合成的柱状沸石

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石显著改善了PDH反应的性能。例如，负载在分级ZSM-5上的PtSn显示出比微孔ZSM-5更高的丙烷转化率（50%对30%）和丙烯选择性（95%对65%）。此外，分级S-1负载的催化剂表现出比块状S-1负载的催化剂高得多的转化频率（TOF）（1112.2 h-1对157.6 h-1）。这些改进可归因于分级沸石中活性位点的可及性增强和分散性更好。
