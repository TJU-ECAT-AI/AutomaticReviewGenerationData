[1] "Hierarchical zeolite combines the intrinsic micropores of zeolites with an auxiliary mesoporous/macroporous network, which achieves enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores/macropores) without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect (micropores)."

[2] "For the PDH reaction, the reported hierarchical molecular sieves include mesoporous zeolites prepared via desilication or self-assembly, the 2D/layered zeolites synthesized via bifunctional surfactants, and pillared zeolites synthesized using TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates"

[3] "Under the same testing conditions, PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, which are much higher than those of the counterpart with parent microporous ZSM-5 (30% propane conversion and 65% propylene selectivity)."

[4] "The hierarchical Pt/hierarchical S-1 catalyst exhibits a higher Pt-related TOF of 1112.2 h1 than the catalyst with bulk S-1 supports (TOF is 157.6 h1)."

Hierarchical zeolites enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by combining micropores with mesopores/macropores. This combination maintains the confinement effect of micropores while improving overall accessibility through the larger pores.

The main types and synthesis methods of hierarchical zeolites for PDH include:
1. Mesoporous zeolites prepared by desilication or self-assembly
2. 2D/layered zeolites synthesized using bifunctional surfactants
3. Pillared zeolites made with TPAOH and TBPOH as cotemplates

Hierarchical zeolites significantly improve PDH performance compared to traditional zeolites. For example, PtSn on hierarchical ZSM-5 showed much higher propane conversion (50% vs 30%) and propylene selectivity (95% vs 65%) compared to microporous ZSM-5. Similarly, Pt on hierarchical S-1 exhibited a much higher turnover frequency (1112.2 h-1) than on bulk S-1 (157.6 h-1). These improvements are attributed to enhanced accessibility and better dispersion of active sites in the hierarchical structure.

分级沸石通过将微孔与介孔/大孔相结合来增强PDH反应的可及性。这种组合保持了微孔的限域效应，同时通过更大的孔提高了整体可及性。

用于PDH的分级沸石的主要类型和合成方法包括：
1. 通过脱硅或自组装制备的介孔沸石
2. 使用双功能表面活性剂合成的2D/层状沸石
3. 使用TPAOH和TBPOH作为共模板剂合成的柱状沸石

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石显著改善了PDH性能。例如，在分级ZSM-5上的PtSn显示出更高的丙烷转化率（50%对30%）和丙烯选择性（95%对65%），相比于微孔ZSM-5。同样，在分级S-1上的Pt表现出更高的转化频率（1112.2 h-1），而在块状S-1上仅为157.6 h-1。这些改进归因于分级结构中活性位点的可及性增强和更好的分散。
