Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information specifically about hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The text focuses on the synthesis and characterization of subnanometric platinum and platinum-tin clusters encapsulated in purely siliceous MFI zeolite, and their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss hierarchical zeolites or compare them to traditional zeolites for PDH reactions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The text focuses on the synthesis and characterization of subnanometric platinum clusters in purely siliceous MFI zeolites, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolite structures or their application in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided document.
