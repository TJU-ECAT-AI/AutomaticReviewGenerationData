The given literature does not contain information about hierarchical zeolites or their use in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on comparing the catalytic performance of Pt clusters located inside zeolite cages (Pt@NaX) versus on the exterior surface of zeolites (Pt/NaX) for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or their effects on PDH reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

所给文献中没有关于分级沸石或其在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中应用的信息。该文档主要比较了位于沸石笼内(Pt@NaX)和沸石外表面(Pt/NaX)的Pt团簇在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能。它没有讨论分级沸石、其合成方法或对PDH反应的影响。因此,无法根据所提供的文档回答这个问题。
