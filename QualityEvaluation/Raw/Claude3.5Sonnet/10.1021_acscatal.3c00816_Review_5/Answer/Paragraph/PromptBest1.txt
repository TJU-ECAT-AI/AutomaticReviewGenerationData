2. Macroporous zeolites
3. Micro-mesoporous zeolites
4. Micro-macroporous zeolites
5. Micro-meso-macroporous zeolites
6. Hierarchical zeolite composites (e.g., TS-1@SBA-16)
7. Dealuminated zeolites (e.g., beta zeolite)

5. Better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011]
6. Reduced side reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization [10.3390/catal9020174]

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by creating a multi-scale porous structure. This structure improves mass transfer, diffusion of reactants and products, and maintains the intrinsic catalytic properties of the zeolite. The combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores achieves enhanced micropore accessibility without sacrificing the intrinsic confinement effect of micropores [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_5].

Main types of hierarchical zeolites:
1. Micro-mesoporous zeolites
2. Micro-macroporous zeolites
3. Micro-meso-macroporous zeolites [10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016]
4. Hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets (Si-MFI-NS)
5. Mesoporous MFI zeolites
6. Self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers
7. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores [10.1002/adma.201803966]
8. Hierarchical ZSM-5
9. Dealuminated beta zeolite [10.1039/D0CS01260B]
10. TS-1@SBA-16 composite [10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7]

Synthesis methods:
1. Post-treatment synthetic routes: 
   - Selective desilication/dealumination processes [10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016]
   - Alkaline treatment (e.g., NaOH solution) [10.1016/j.cjche.2021.11.020]
2. In situ synthetic routes:
   - Using organic or inorganic templates during zeolite crystallization [10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016]
   - Using structure-directing agents (SDAs) like tetra-(n-butyl)phosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) [10.3390/catal9020174]
3. Repetitive branching synthesis strategy
4. Utilization of long-chain alkyl structure-directing agents [10.1039/D0CS01260B]
5. Self-assembly method (e.g., enwrapping zeolite crystals with ordered mesoporous silica) [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_5]
6. Post-synthetic degallation of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.09.011]

Improvements in PDH reaction performance:
1. Enhanced accessibility to active sites
2. Improved diffusion of reactants and products
3. Reduced coke formation and improved catalyst stability
4. Higher conversion rates and selectivity
5. Better dispersion of active metal species
6. Decreased acid content, leading to improved coke accommodation
7. Modified migration process of coke from active metal sites to supports [10.1039/D0CS01260B]
8. Accelerated mass transport
9. Reduced diffusion paths for reactants
10. Extended catalyst lifetime [10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00016]

Specific performance improvements:
- PtSn supported on hierarchical ZSM-5 exhibits an initial propane conversion of 50% and propylene selectivity of 95%, compared to 30% conversion and 65% selectivity for parent microporous ZSM-5 [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_5].
- Pt catalysts supported on hierarchical S-1 zeolites show a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1112.2 h⁻¹, compared to 157.6 h⁻¹ for bulk S-1 supports [10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_5].
- Hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts demonstrated 26 times higher conversion and 10-100% increased propylene selectivity compared to bulk Ga-MFI catalysts [10.1039/D0CS01260B].
- Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 achieved an initial propane conversion of 54.5%, higher than catalysts supported on either TS-1 or SBA-16 alone [10.1007/s40242-019-9120-7].

By combining micropores and mesopores/macropores, these materials address the limitations of traditional zeolites while maintaining their beneficial properties. The improved mass transfer, enhanced accessibility to active sites, and reduced diffusion limitations contribute to superior catalytic performance.

Future research directions may focus on:
