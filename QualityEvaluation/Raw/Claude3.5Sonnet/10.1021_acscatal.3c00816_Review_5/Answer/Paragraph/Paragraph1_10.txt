Hierarchical zeolites have emerged as a significant advancement in the field of catalysis, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These innovative materials combine the intrinsic properties of traditional zeolites, such as high acidity and shape selectivity, with enhanced mass transport capabilities due to their unique multi-level pore structure. The hierarchical structure typically consists of micropores inherent to zeolites, complemented by additional meso- or macropores, which facilitate improved molecular diffusion and accessibility to active sites. Various synthesis methods have been developed to create these hierarchical structures, including top-down approaches like dealumination and desilication, as well as bottom-up techniques such as templating with organic structure-directing agents or nanoparticle assembly. Different types of hierarchical zeolites, such as ZSM-5, Beta, and Y, have been successfully synthesized and tailored for specific applications. In PDH reactions, these materials have demonstrated superior catalytic performance compared to conventional zeolites, exhibiting enhanced propene selectivity, improved catalyst stability, and reduced coke formation. The unique structural properties of hierarchical zeolites make them promising candidates for optimizing industrial PDH processes and other catalytic applications in the petrochemical industry.
