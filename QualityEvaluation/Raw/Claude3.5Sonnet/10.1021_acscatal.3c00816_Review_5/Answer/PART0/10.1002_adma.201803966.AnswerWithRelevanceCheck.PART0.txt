          [1] "Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites to generate larger and more accessible void nanospaces has proven to be an efficient method for encapsulating small metal clusters with high loadings within zeolite matrices."

[2] "In addition, the introduction of additional mesopores could not only maintain MNPs against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions but also decrease the diffusion limitation and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of products over such catalysts."

[3] "Recently, a new type of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers (2 nm) has been synthesized by the Ryoo and Tsapatsis groups."

[4] "Fabricating intracrystalline mesopores inside the zeolite crystals could be a good approach to maintaining micropore-selective catalysis."

[5] "Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchant can create intracrystal mesopores; however, the etching process is usually accompanied by the formation of open pores connected to the surface."

[6] "Recently, a series of metals supported on hierarchically porous catalysts have been synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials."

[7] "Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures."

[8] "Compared with conventional ZSM-5 nanosized zeolites, the self-pillared nanosheet-like zeolites could effectively control the sizes of Pt clusters (1.0 nm) due to the remarkably increased external surface areas."

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for reactions like PDH by introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites. This creates larger and more accessible void nanospaces, which can encapsulate small metal clusters with high loadings. The additional mesopores help maintain metal nanoparticles (MNPs) against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions, while also decreasing diffusion limitations and increasing catalytic activity and selectivity.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites include:
1. Self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers
2. Zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores

The main synthesis methods include:
1. Bottom-up methods (e.g., using soft or hard templates during zeolite crystallization)
2. Top-down methods (post-synthesis treatments like desilication)
3. Self-pillaring of zeolite nanosheets
4. Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchants

Hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:
1. Maintaining MNPs against sintering and leaching 
2. Decreasing diffusion limitations
3. Increasing catalytic activity and selectivity
4. Providing larger accessible void spaces for encapsulating metal clusters
5. Maintaining micropore-selective catalysis while improving overall accessibility
6. Allowing for higher metal loadings while maintaining small cluster sizes
7. Improving stability of metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching
8. Providing better control over metal cluster sizes due to increased external surface areas

While the literature does not specifically mention PDH reactions, these benefits would likely apply to improve PDH performance as well.

          分级沸石通过在微孔沸石中引入更大的次级孔来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强对PDH等反应的可及性。这创造了更大、更易接近的空隙纳米空间，可以包封高负载量的小金属簇。额外的介孔有助于在严苛条件下防止金属纳米粒子（MNPs）烧结和流失，同时还能降低扩散限制，提高催化活性和选择性。

分级沸石的主要类型包括：
1. 具有纳米片层的自支撑介孔沸石
2. 具有晶内介孔的沸石

主要的合成方法包括：
1. 自下而上方法（例如在沸石结晶过程中使用软模板或硬模板）
2. 自上而下方法（脱硅等后合成处理）
3. 沸石纳米片的自支撑
4. 用碱性或氟化物蚀刻剂对沸石进行后处理

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能：
1. 防止MNPs烧结和流失
2. 降低扩散限制
3. 提高催化活性和选择性
4. 提供更大的可及空隙以包覆金属簇
5. 在改善整体可及性的同时保持微孔选择性催化
6. 在保持小簇大小的同时允许更高的金属负载
7. 改善金属纳米粒子抗烧结和流失的稳定性
8. 由于外部表面积增加，对金属簇大小提供更好的控制

虽然文献没有特别提到PDH反应，但这些优势可能也适用于改善PDH性能。
