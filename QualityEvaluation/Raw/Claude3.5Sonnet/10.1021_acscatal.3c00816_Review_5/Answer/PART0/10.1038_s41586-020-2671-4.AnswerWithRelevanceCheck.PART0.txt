          [1] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores"

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "The mz-deGa zeolite was prepared by the post-synthetic degallation of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite, which was prepared using [C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2 (denoted as C18-6-4) as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent."

[4] "The framework Ga species in the mesoporous MFI gallosilicate was removed by HNO3 treatments."

[5] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

          Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a unique structure with ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores. This structure facilitates both reactant and product diffusion while allowing high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

The main type of hierarchical zeolite mentioned is a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure. The synthesis method involves using a multi-ammonium surfactant (specifically [C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2, denoted as C18-6-4) as a micro-/mesoporous structure-directing agent. Additional steps include:
1. Post-synthetic degallation of mesoporous MFI gallosilicate zeolite to create mz-deGa zeolite.
2. Removal of framework Ga species by HNO3 treatments to create more defect sites (silanol nests).
3. Incorporation of rare-earth elements (La and Y) along with Pt to improve catalyst dispersion and stability.

While the literature does not provide direct comparisons of PDH reaction performance between hierarchical zeolites and traditional zeolites, it suggests improved performance through:
1. Enhanced reactant and product diffusion
2. Better metal nanoparticle dispersion
3. Improved catalyst dispersion and stability due to rare-earth element incorporation
4. Potential for higher activity and durability compared to traditional alumina supports

These hierarchical zeolites are being explored as a replacement for alumina supports in the search for highly active and more durable PDH catalysts, indicating their potential for improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

          分级沸石通过提供独特的结构来增强PDH反应的可及性，这种结构包括超薄的沸石骨架和三维互连的介孔。这种结构既促进反应物和产物的扩散，又允许金属纳米粒子在介孔内高度分散。

文献中提到的主要分级沸石类型是具有分级微孔/介孔结构的硅质MFI沸石。合成方法涉及使用多铵表面活性剂（具体为[C18H37N+(Me)2C6H12N+(Me)2C4H9]Br2，简称C18-6-4）作为微孔/介孔结构导向剂。额外步骤包括：
1. 对介孔MFI镓硅酸盐沸石进行后合成脱镓处理，制备mz-deGa沸石。
2. 通过HNO3处理移除骨架Ga物种，创造更多缺陷位点（硅醇巢）。
3. 将稀土元素（La和Y）与Pt一起掺入，以改善催化剂分散和稳定性。

虽然文献没有直接比较分级沸石和传统沸石在PDH反应性能方面的差异，但它暗示了性能的改进通过：
1. 增强反应物和产物的扩散
2. 更好的金属纳米粒子分散
3. 由于稀土元素的掺入，改善了催化剂分散和稳定性
4. 与传统氧化铝载体相比，具有更高活性和耐久性的潜力

这些分级沸石正被探索用作氧化铝载体的替代品，以寻找高活性和更耐久的PDH催化剂，表明它们在PDH反应中具有改善催化性能的潜力。
