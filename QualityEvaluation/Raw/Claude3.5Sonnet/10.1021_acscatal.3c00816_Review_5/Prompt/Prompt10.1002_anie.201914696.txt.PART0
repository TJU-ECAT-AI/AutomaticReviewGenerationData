B-MWW Zeolite: The Case Against Single-Site Catalysis
Graphical Abstract
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts.
Abstract
Boron-containing materials have recently been identified as highly selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins. It has previously been demonstrated by several spectroscopic characterization techniques that the surface of these boron-containing ODH catalysts oxidize and hydrolyze under reaction conditions, forming an amorphous B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06) layer. Yet, the precise nature of the active site(s) remains elusive. In this Communication, we provide a detailed characterization of zeolite MCM-22 isomorphously substituted with boron (B-MWW). Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene. The catalytic inactivity of B-MWW for ODH of propane falsifies the hypothesis that site-isolated BO3 units are the active site in boron-based catalysts. This observation is at odds with other traditionally studied catalysts like vanadium-based catalysts and provides an important piece of the mechanistic puzzle.
Zeolites, microporous, crystalline materials composed of characteristic SiO4 tetrahedra, are among the most widely used industrial catalysts.1 The so-called T-sites may be replaced with different atoms via isomorphous substitution to tune the catalytic properties byfor examplealtering the Bronsted/Lewis acidity or creating a catalytic center. Isomorphous substitution can be achieved directly via hydrothermal synthesis or post-synthetically by methods, including impregnation and ion-exchange.2, 3 Although widely applied in industry, isomorphously substituted zeolites are still the subject of many ongoing studies.4
Boron-containing materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes, have been shown to be highly selective catalysts for the transformation of light alkanes to olefins via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).5-11 Analysis of these materials after catalytic testing for the ODH of propane revealed the formation of an oxidized, amorphous boron phase at the catalyst surface. This layer consists of three-coordinate boron with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups represented by the general formula B2(OH)xO(3x/2) (x=06).12 To understand the function of this oxidized boron phase, we recently investigated silica-supported boron oxide (B/SiO2) materials, which showed a similar conversion-selectivity trend and product distribution to the bulk boron-containing catalysts.13 While these results confirm that the active site is most likely contained in the oxidized boron phase, the precise reaction mechanism and active site structure have not been identified. Magic angle spinning (MAS) 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy (SSNMR) analysis of the B/SiO2 materials revealed the B2(OH)xO3x/2 phase restructures under ODH reaction conditions to give a higher degree of boron agglomeration. The observed restructuring is in line with a recent computational study on h-BN that predicts the formation of a highly dynamic oxidized boron active phase under reaction conditions (500C), in agreement with the low Taman temperature of boron oxides.14
The large distribution of boron sites in active materials and their dynamic nature under reaction conditions precludes the precise experimental identification of the active site(s). To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. Here, we focus on zeolite MCM-22 isomorphously substituted with boron (referred to as B-MWW). MWW is an industrially prepared catalysts used as an additive to ZSM-5 for catalytic cracking, in Mobil's Badger Cumene process for the alkylation of benzene, the alkylation of toluene, and the liquid phase epoxidation of propylene.15-18 The borosilicate form of MWW (also called ERB-1) is used primarily as an intermediate for creating high Si/Al ratio frameworks and for the post-synthetic incorporation of metals into the structure.19 Because of its industrial applications, we know that the MWW framework can accommodate propylene molecules and is therefore viable for use as a potential propane ODH catalyst.
B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure (see Supporting Information).20 The successful synthesis of the MWW framework was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (FigureS1) and N2 physisorption (SBET=498m2g1).20, 21 The boron loading was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to be 1.10.1wt.%. This loading is within the 0.232.20wt.% range for B/SiO2 catalysts made by incipient wetness impregnation that all showed significant conversion under our ODH reaction conditions.13
Catalytic testing for the ODH of propane was performed at 500C under a flow of C3H8, O2, and N2 with a pretreatment at 525C under the same gas composition.13 Surprisingly, the B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e. <0.5% conversion). This result was unexpected since a B/SiO2 catalyst with 0.23wt.% boron showed 92% total olefin selectivity at 4% propane conversion.13 The boron content did not change, within the error margin of the experiment, indicating that there was insignificant leaching during reaction. This lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are surprisingly not active for propane ODH. As a further control, we performed ODH catalytic testing for a catalyst made by incipient wetness impregnation of boron onto the B-MWW zeolite, denoted B/B-MWW. B/B-MWW was made by a similar procedure as B/SiO2 (see Supporting Information).13 The B/B-MWW catalyst (1.30.1wt.%) showed similar catalytic activity to the B/SiO2 catalyst, with a 90% total olefin selectivity at 5% propane conversion. We have previously shown that B/SiO2 catalysts contain agglomerated boron species as is likely the case for B/B-MWW. As discussed in detail below, the B-MWW is likely an inactive ODH catalyst because it contains very stable and isolated framework species.
To investigate the source of ODH inactivity in B-MWW, we performed 1H and 11B MAS SSNMR spectroscopy experiments to directly probe the structure and distribution of boron atoms in the zeolite framework. Prior to all SSNMR experiments, the samples were fully dehydrated and further handled in an inert atmosphere. Direct excitation 11B spin echo MAS SSNMR spectra of pristine B-MWW (fresh) and after 12hours on stream (spent) were recorded at 11.7T (ν0(1H)=500MHz) with a 10kHz MAS frequency (Figure1). 11BSSNMR spectra of fresh and spent B-MWW samples were fit to three sites and display near identical quadrupolar powder patterns, suggesting no boron restructuring occurred under the reaction conditions (Table1). The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species (FigureS2).12, 22, 23 The validity of the three site analytical fits in Figure1 were further confirmed by a 2D 11B triple-quantum multiple-quantum MAS (MQMAS) spectrum of B-MWW fresh, fitting a 9.4T spin echo 11B SSNMR spectrum (FigureS3) and by performing 2D 1H-11B heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) experiments (discussed below). On the basis of δiso(11B), the simulated peaks with δiso(11B)=11ppm (red fit) and δiso(11B)=12ppm (green fit) are assigned to framework B(OSi)3 species substituted into the zeolite.12, 22-24 The observed distribution in δiso(11B) is expected because MWW has eight T-sites that boron could occupy, resulting in a distribution in boron sites from the subtle difference in chemical environment.24, 25 Based upon the analytical simulations, B(OSi)3 units make up ca. 90% of the boron incorporated into the framework. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide. All of these assignments are consistent with the findings of Zones and co-workers who previously used 1H, 11B and 29Si SSNMR spectroscopy to characterized boron doped B-β, B-SSZ-33 and B-SSZ-42 zeolites.24 Their high field (19.6T) 11B spin echo, 2D 1H11B CP-HETCOR and 11B MQMAS SSNMR spectra clearly showed that B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) incorporated into the framework (δiso(11B)=10.014.8ppm, depending on the zeolite) resonate at a lower δiso(11B) than non-framework boron species (18.0ppm).24 The δiso(11B) of B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) species measured by Zones etal. matches our results very well, verifying that B-MWW synthesized here contains primarily framework species.24

[a]Fresh and spent B-MWW were fit to identical parameters.
In comparison, the 11B spin echo spectrum of the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW reveals that 57% of the boron species are framework B(OSi)3 groups (δiso(11B)=11ppm) and 43% are B(OSi)2(OH) species (δiso(11B)=15ppm, FiguresS4S5). Clearly, the B(OSi)2(OH) sites now make up a larger fraction of the boron species in B/B-MWW. The 11B spin echo spectrum of B/B-MWW and accompanying NMR parameters are similar to that of catalytically active B/SiO2.13 While we have assigned the 11BNMR signals of B/B-MWW as framework B(OSi)3 and B(OSi)2(OH) because of the similarity in 11BNMR parameters to B-MWW, some of the 11BNMR signal from B/B-MWW likely arise from clustered boron sites, as discussed below.
To better understand the boron speciation and confirm the assignments of the distinct 11BNMR signals for B-MWW, we performed 1H-11B correlation NMR experiments. Because of the similarity in the 1D 11B SSNMR spectra for fresh and spent B-MWW, we only consider the fresh material for these experiments. 2D 11B1H dipolar-refocused INEPT (D-RINEPT) spectra were recorded with 0.64ms (blue) or 2.56ms (red) of total SR 1H heteronuclear dipolar recoupling and a 25kHz MAS frequency (Figure2a).26, 27 Analysis of the 1D D-RINEPT and 2D11B1H D-RINEPT spectra clearly illustrates that distinct 1H and 11B resonances can be observed depending on the duration of heteronuclear dipolar recoupling. With 0.64ms of recoupling (blue trace), only the higher frequency 1HNMR signals (ca. 3.6ppm) are observed and they show intense correlations to the higher frequency 11BNMR signal (δiso 15ppm, Figure2b and FigureS6). On the basis of the chemical shifts, the 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and 11BNMR signal with δiso=15ppm are assigned to framework B(OSi)2(OH) species (Figure3). The 2D 11B1H D-RINEPT spectrum recorded with 2.56ms of dipolar recoupling shows additional strong correlations between the 1HNMR signal at 2.7ppm and 11BNMR signal with δiso of 12-11ppm. Notably, the 11BNMR spectrum extracted from this 2D 11B1H D-RINEPT spectrum is essentially identical in appearance to the 11B spin echo spectrum (Figure2b and FigureS6), suggesting that all boron atoms within B-MWW are proximate to 1H spins. In contrast, the 11BNMR spectrum of B/B-MWW extracted from the 2D D-RINEPT experiment shows different signal intensities from the corresponding 11B spin echo NMR spectrum (FigureS5). Taken together these observations suggest that some boron spins are distant from protons, likely due to the formation of some boron oxide clusters in B/B-MWW.

Simplified illustration of the two different 1H-11B interactions observed in the 2D 11B1H D-RINEPT spectra and molecular structures of framework boron sites.
To estimate the 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance for each pair of 1H-11BNMR signals and thus provide a more detailed structure of boron incorporation into the zeolite framework, we recorded 1H-11B dipolar recoupling build-up curves using the 11B1H D-RINEPT sequence. In this experiment, the 11B1H D-RINEPT 1HNMR signal intensity is recorded as a function of the heteronuclear dipolar recoupling duration (Figure2c,d). The dipolar coupling constant (Dij) between two spins is proportional to the inverse of the distance cubed (Dij  rij3). By comparing the experimental build-up curves to numerical SIMPSON simulations for different 1H-11B dipolar coupling constants, 1H-11B inter-nuclear distances can be estimated.28, 29 The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a dipolar coupling constant of ca. 3.6kHz, corresponding to a 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance of ca. 2.2Å (Figure2c and FigureS7a). It is important to keep in mind that an H atom in an isolated B-OH group may experience some degree of rotation. Rotation will partially average the 1H-11B dipolar coupling constant, resulting in measurement of lower dipolar coupling constants and longer than expected inter-nuclear distances. The D-RINEPT signal build-up for the 1HNMR signal at 2.7ppm fits best to a simulated curve with a 1H-11B dipolar coupling constant of ca. 1.6kHz, corresponding to a 2.9Å 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance (Figure2d and FigureS7b). Taking into account the 11B δiso of 11ppm and the relatively large 1H-11B inter-nuclear distance, this 1H signal is assigned to a framework B(OSi)3 species that is adjacent to a framework silanol (Figure3), in agreement with previous models of boron substituted zeolites.24 A proton detected 1H{29Si} cross polarization MAS (CPMAS) spectrum of fresh B-MWW confirms that the 1HNMR signals at ca. 2.7ppm results from a silanol defect adjacent to boron (FigureS9).21, 24, 30, 31 Note that the 1H{29Si}CPMAS spectrum of B-MWW fresh required ca. 10hours of signal averaging, confirming the majority of the zeolite framework is pristine. Infrared spectroscopy of the dehydrated B-MWW confirms that B-OH as well as silanol defect sites are present in the fresh and spent sample (FigureS10).32
In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below. In the 2D 11B1H DRINEPT spectrum of B-MWW recorded with 2.56ms of recoupling only weak correlations are observed between the B(OSi)2(OH) 1HNMR signal at 3.6ppm and the B(OSi)3 11BNMR signals, suggesting these sites are well separated within the zeolite. This interpretation is confirmed by a 2D 1H-1H dipolar double-quantum-single-quantum (DQ-SQ) homonuclear correlation spectrum of B-MWW which shows that the 1HNMR signals at 2.7ppm, assigned to silanol adjacent to B(OSi)3, do not give rise to any appreciable DQ signal intensity (FigureS11). In comparison, these silanol groups give rise to an observable 1H DQ NMR signal in B/B-MWW, consistent with more extensive aggregation of boron sites in this material. Finally, 1D 11B-11B DQ-SQ experiments show that the DQ-filtered 11BNMR signal for B-MWW is about three times less than that of B/B-MWW (FigureS12).33-35 Notably, the DQ-filtered 11B solid-state NMR spectra of B-MWW and B/B-MWW both show signals with more positive chemical shifts as compared to the SQ 11B spin echo spectra. The more positive shifts suggest that aggregation preferentially occurs for hydroxylated or oxide-like boron sites, both of which are much more common in B/B-MWW as shown by quantitative 11B spin echo experiments above. All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites.
In this work, we successfully synthesized stable, isolated framework B(OSi)3 (major, ca. 90%) and B(OSi)2(OH) (minor, ca. 10%) species in zeolite MWW framework and catalytically tested them for the ODH of propane. The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group. Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels. As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms.12, 13 The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity. This study advances the understanding of boron species involved in the propane ODH mechanism and will direct future work in understanding the molecular origins of highly selective ODH catalysts. Further investigations are underway to determine the surface mobility and understand precisely which types of boron-boron interactions are required to form active ODH catalysts.
