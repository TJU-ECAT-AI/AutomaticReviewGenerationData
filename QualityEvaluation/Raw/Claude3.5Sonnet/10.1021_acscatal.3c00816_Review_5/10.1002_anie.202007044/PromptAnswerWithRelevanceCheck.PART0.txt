If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The text focuses on the ultrafast encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into ZSM-5 zeolite and its application in propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

The given literature does not contain information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The text focuses on the ultrafast encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into MFI zeolite (ZSM-5) for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolite structures or compare them to traditional zeolites for PDH reactions. The document does not mention synthesis methods or types of hierarchical zeolites, nor does it discuss how they might improve PDH reaction performance. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
