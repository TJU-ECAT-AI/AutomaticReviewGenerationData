Abstract
The present study reports the unbiased chemical etching of micron-sized ZSM-5 crystals with an NH4F solution, resulting in house-of-cards-like single crystals containing large rectangular cavities surrounded by thin (15–30 nm), flat, and highly crystalline walls. The formation of such house-of-cards-like architecture is a result of the preferential extraction of misoriented nanocrystalline domains followed by the uniform dissolution of the remaining part of the crystal. The characteristic features of NH4F-treated zeolites are the retention of framework composition (Si/Al) and Brønsted acidity, high crystallinity, a moderate increase in the external surface area, and increased accessibility to their active sites. Such a combination produces zeolite catalysts with superior performances (activity, stability, and coke resistance) in the ethanol-to-hydrocarbon conversion. The physicochemical properties of this newly engineered zeolite are compared to those of a hierarchical zeolite obtained by caustic leaching and zeolite nanosheets synthesized with a bifunctional template, a diquaternary ammonium-type surfactant.

1. Introduction
Zeolites revolutionized oil refining and petrochemistry due to their excellent chemical and (hydro)thermal stability, unique microporous structures of molecular dimensions, and tunable acidity located in a shape-selective environment. (1−3) With an increasing demand for highly active and stable catalysts for existing and emerging processes, a recent work with zeolites focused on morphology tailoring either during their synthesis (bottom-up approach) or by postsynthesis modifications (top-down approach), the so-called zeolite crystal engineering. (4−8)
Transport limitations in their micropore channels are probably the most serious drawbacks of zeolite catalysts. (9) Decreasing the zeolite crystal size is a straightforward approach to minimize their impact. Advances in the understanding of zeolite nucleation/crystal growth allowed the preparation of nanocrystals of many industrially important zeolites. (10,11) However, the number of zeolite crystals synthesized with nanosized dimensions is still limited. Zeolite materials with nanodimensions in a particular crystallographic direction were also prepared. (12) These two-dimensional microporous materials, referred to as layered or sheetlike zeolites, offer the advantage of extended external surface areas and enhanced diffusion in a particular crystallographic direction. They were prepared, for instance, by Corma and co-workers by exfoliating layered MWW-type zeolite precursors. (13) The exfoliation approach is however limited to a few zeolites since it works with layered precursors with weaker bonds in a particular crystal direction. Ryoo et al. successfully synthesized a series of crystalline molecular sieves (ZSM-5 and zeolite β) with tunable mesostructures and nanosheet or nanosponge morphologies using amphiphilic organosilanes or multiquaternary ammonium surfactants as bifunctional templates. (14−16) A low-cost approach to zeolite nanosheets forming “house-of-cards” structures was reported by Tsapatsis et al. (17) They used a template promoting the repetitive branching of orthogonally connected nanosheets. Such intergrowths generate structures with a mesoporous network of 2–7 nm. The resulting polycrystalline hierarchical materials offer the advantages of higher accessibility for bulky molecules, shorter diffusion path lengths in the microporosity, and a larger external surface area. At present, such advanced materials were only obtained by a bottom-up approach. To the best of our knowledge, the preparation of house-of-cards by a top-down approach has not yet been reported. A postsynthesis approach to house-of-cards zeolites would provide significant advantages such as (i) applicability to a large number of zeolites; (ii) easy transformation of single crystals in house-of-cards materials; and (iii) cost and environmentally benign scaling-up to produce zeolites.
Extraction of framework cations by chemical etching has been used since the first commercial applications of zeolites (e.g., hydrocracking, fluid catalytic cracking, isomerization, and so on) to alleviate these ever-present mass transport limitations. For instance, high-temperature (>600 °C) steaming extracts aluminum from zeolite frameworks and redistributes it in extra-framework positions; while the overall Si/Al is unchanged, the framework Si/Al increases and rearrangement of framework Si generates a secondary mesoporosity. (18) Recently, caustic leaching (19,20) was extensively revisited, better understood, and shown to generate secondary mesopores in high silica zeolites. (21) Chemical etching is an efficient and straightforward method to improve intracrystalline transport and reduce diffusion barriers. However, the preferential or biased extraction of a particular framework cation (Al or Si) leads to a dissolution profile, strongly dependent on the zeolite composition and therefore difficult to control. Recently, an unbiased chemical etching was developed using NH4F solutions. (22−26) Concentrated ammonium fluoride solutions were shown to dissolve Si and Al from zeolite frameworks at equal rates. While leaving the zeolite composition (Si/Al) unchanged, this approach dissolves preferentially defects in zeolite crystals, such as interfaces between twin crystals, grain boundaries, lattice defects, and so on. This unbiased fluoride extraction is HF free; moreover, the biased (NH4)2SiF6 processing of zeolites is currently used in the commercial production of modified (dealumination and subsequent healing by silication) FAU zeolites (LZ-210 from UOP LLC (27,28)).
The objective of the present work is to develop a universal top-down approach to produce single-crystal house-of-cards-like zeolite catalysts. It is based on the recently discovered mosaic structure of zeolite crystals, i.e., the presence of rectangular nanocrystalline domains with well-defined grain boundaries. (24) Such domains were observed in MFI, (24) FER, (29) and FAU (30) and appear to be ubiquitous. They are preferentially dissolved when an unbiased chemical etching is applied to zeolite crystals, leaving behind rectangular cavities several tens of nanometers wide. The remaining part of the crystals dissolves with a similar rate of dissolution following the morphology of extracted nanocrystalline domains, which is employed in the present study to form a house-of-cards-like material by postsynthesis etching. This is illustrated by comparing the unbiased NH4F etching of a parent (ZP) ZSM-5 zeolite, ZF, the Si-biased caustic leaching of the same parent, ZB, (31) (31) and zeolite nanosheets (ZNS) prepared with a diquaternary ammonium-type surfactant acting as a bifunctional structure-directing agent. (32) The ethanol-to-hydrocarbon (ETH) conversion was used as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic potential of these zeolites and relate it to their physicochemical properties.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Physicochemical Characteristics of the Zeolites
2.1.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The sample preparation is provided in the Supporting Information. The XRD patterns of ZP (commercially available zeolite ZSM-5, the parent), ZB (a biased caustic etching of ZP), ZF (an unbiased NH4F-etched derivative), and ZNS (a bottom-up ZSM-5 nanosheet preparation) are displayed in Figure 1. ZP shows sharp and narrow peaks characteristic of a highly crystalline micron-sized MFI-type material. The XRD peaks of ZF are equally narrow and well-defined, indicating that NH4F etching does not impact crystallinity. ZB shows much lower peak intensities than those of its parent. Some of the peaks are missing in the XRD pattern of ZNS, as expected for such type of material. (32)

2.1.2. N2 Physisorption
The physicochemical properties of all zeolites are summarized in Table 1. The parent micron-sized (ZP) crystals display a type I isotherm (Figure S1) characteristic of a purely microporous zeolite. (33) ZF and ZB zeolites exhibit a second uptake and a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure, revealing the presence of mesopores. The micropore volume of ZF is fully retained compared to that of its parent, and its external surface area is lower than that of its caustic leached counterpart, ZB; ZB has, however, lost some of its micropore volume, in agreement with the XRD data. The zeolite nanosheets, ZNS, display a type I isotherm at low p/p0 combined with a type IV(a) at high p/p0. The presence of a hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range 0.4 < p/p0 < 1 is typical for such lamellar materials due to the stacking of nanosheets. ZNS also exhibits a lower micropore volume and larger external surface area. The mesopore distribution for all samples is presented in Figure 2. No mesopores are observed in the parent micron-sized crystals, ZP. ZF exhibits a large pore size distribution between ca. 10 nm and more than 100 nm. The ZB pore size distribution is also large, but within the mesopore range, i.e., 2–50 nm. (33) The pore size distribution of ZNS, with a maximum of around 6 nm, is much sharper compared to that of ZB and ZF. All three hierarchical zeolites have a mesopore volume higher than 0.3 cm3 g–1 (Table 1). However, ZF shows only a slight increase in external surface area compared to that of its parent. Conversely, ZB and ZNS both develop external surfaces exceeding 200 m2 g–1. We attribute these differences to the types of pores formed by NH4F and caustic leaching and the stacking of nanosheets. The dissolution in fluoride medium results in the formation of large meso- and macropores (Figure 2), which exhibit low specific surface area (Table 1). This can be further interpreted based on a rough estimation of the relation among the surface (S), the pore diameter (d), and the pore volume (V) using d = 4V/S. In contrast, both ZB and ZNS contain a substantial amount of small mesopores with size below 10 nm (Figure 2). Accordingly, a substantial increase in the external surface area is observed (Table 1).

2.1.3. Morphological Analysis
The morphology and secondary porosity of the zeolites are described by combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). NH4F etching transforms the micron-sized ZSM-5 crystals (Figure 3a, inset) into a foamlike material with thin crystalline walls (Figure 3a,b). The macromorphological features of the crystals are retained. However, the crystalline body is fully transformed into a mosaic of rectangular cavities, large enough to be observed with a scanning electron microscope (Figure 3a,b). TEM provides further insights into the structure and morphology of the NH4F-etched zeolite. Figure 3c shows a representative TEM image of such a NH4F-etched ZSM-5 crystal. Figure 3e–g show slices through the electron tomography reconstruction of a selected zeolite grain. The slices highlight the high porosity of chemically treated zeolite but also the remaining crystalline pore walls (Figure 3d) with a thickness ranging from 10 to 30 nm. The tomography shows that the NH4F-etched zeolite contains two types of secondary pores: (i) large interconnected rectangular-shaped ones and (ii) smaller ones probably formed later on during etching. Three-dimensional (3D) models indicate that even the vast majority of the smaller mesopores is connected to the secondary porous network, indicating that pore connectivity approaches 100% and has an overall meso-macroporosity of around 47%. This excellent connectivity between the various pore networks is an important, albeit often overlooked, feature in hierarchical zeolites. (34) The porosity could even be higher as some of the surface pores (Figure S2) were excluded from the quantification. The 3D geometries of the porous network and their walls resemble the house-of-cards architecture. A schematic presentation of the remaining part of the crystals with the vast system of rectangular, interconnected cavities is presented in Figure S3. It is remarkable that such a significant secondary porosity increase in ZF is achieved without loss of intrinsic microporosity and acidity (Table 1) as well as crystallinity (Figure 1 and Figure 3d).

The zeolite dissolution process is strongly influenced by the zeolite framework composition and crystal zoning in the case of selective chemical extraction of a framework cation. (35−37) The NH4F did not show any sensibility to the framework ratio, including in the case of very low silica zeolites. (25,26) Indeed, the ZF sample shows a Si/Al ratio very similar to that of its parent (Table 1). For this reason, we consider that the exceptional resistance of the periferic parts of the crystals to NH4F etching (Figures 3a, S4, and S5) is an important observation. To get a deeper insight into this peculiar “selected-area” dissolution behavior, a comparative study was conducted by the combined use of high- and low-voltage SEM. The electron beam penetrates deep into the sample at high accelerating voltage. Accordingly, the signal will carry information from deeper layers of the sample. In contrast, low-voltage, high-resolution SEM provides only the surface information, thanks to the much lower landing voltage. (38) Therefore, as the intensity of the generated secondary electrons varies depending on the magnitude of the accelerating voltage, variations in the roughness of specimen surface and the density of the substance can be detected. As can be seen in Figure S6, the crystal surface of ZP shows a uniform contrast under both high- and low-voltage observation models. The 5 min NH4F-treated sample also shows a uniform contrast under the low-voltage observation model (Figure S7a). In the case of the high-voltage model, however, obvious dark areas occur on the b crystal face of the NH4F-treated sample (Figure S7b). This contrast difference is not related to crystal surface etching (i.e., surface roughness) since only a few separated holes can be observed on the b crystal face (Figure S8e). This crystal surface still shows a similar smooth morphology to that of the untreated sample, with the growth steps clearly distinguishable (Figure S8b,e). In addition, the difference in surface contrast is not an individual but a general phenomenon, as a similar inhomogeneous distribution of the phase contrast was also observed in the case of the 10 and 20 min NH4F-treated samples (Figure S9). The surface contrast is not so different in the case of the longer-time (i.e., 30 and 60 min) treated samples (Figure S10). In the later case, the original crystal surfaces are either deeply etched or detached as a result of substantial dissolution of the inner part of zeolite crystals (Figure S11).
Based on these intensive SEM observations, we attribute the difference in surface contrast to the difference in density in different parts of zeolite crystals. Namely, the dissolution of zeolite crystals in NH4F solution is spacially inhomogeneous in the macrosense. In general, the inner part of zeolite crystals is preferentially dissolved. The gravimetric measurement of the weight loss of zeolite with the extension of NH4F etching was also conducted (Figure S12). The continuous decrease of the slop of the weight loss curve shows unambiguously that the dissolution of the ZP crystals is relatively faster at the initial stage and the dissolution rate slows down with the increasing etching time (Figure S12). We further attribute the faster dissolution of the inner part to the fast growth rate at the early stage of crystal growth and the slower dissolution of the crystal periphery to the slow growth rate at the end of the crystallization process where a few defects are formed. Thus, the defect-poor parts of the crystals are resistant to etching. This result is additional evidence showing that the dissolution starts preferentially from framework defects when unbiased etching solution is used.
The relation between the crystallographic structure of the zeolite crystals and the etching direction shown in Figure S4 is confirmed by the high-resolution analysis of some similar grains. Figure S13 shows a typical high-resolution TEM image and the corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern, which illustrate that the preferentially etched facets are on the {010} face, as revealed also by the low-magnification TEM images of the various analyzed zeolite crystals. It should be underlined that the empty cages resulting from crystal dissolution are oriented along the crystallographic axes. This is a proof of the connection between the growing process and dissolution behavior of the crystals. The high-resolution image shown in Figure S14 also sustains this important finding.
We attribute both the spacially inhomegeneous dissolution and the facet-dependent etching behavior to the growth mechanism. Fluoride etching is sensitive solely to the zones of structural stress and defect concentration (Figure S8d), which are more vulnerable to chemical attack. (24,39,40) Thus, the dissolution reflects the particularities of the growth process. Layer-type growth is characteristic of most of the zeolitic materials. (41−44) The detailed mechanism of MFI growth was revealed recently by in situ atomic force microscopy microscopy. (43) It was observed that the MFI growth involves two simultaneous phenomena, oriented attachment of nanoparticles and mono or low-weight silica species. The nanodomains integrated into the growing crystal contain well-defined grain boundaries and thus are rapidly dissolved by NH4F etching (Figure S8c,f), leaving behind rectangular cages. (24) These rectangular cages are surrounded by a crystalline material, which is a result of the uniform growth by means of low-weight silica species. The rate of dissolution of this more stable and uniform part of the crystal is lower (Figure S12). Judging by the straight and flat crystalline walls surrounding the cages, the dissolution can be described as a “layer-by-layer” process. The results of the present study show that the mechanism of dissolution does not change with the time of treatment, and thus, a house-of-cards-like material can be synthesized. A fundamental feature of this material is that each house-of-cards is a single crystal, thanks to the preferential removal of defect-rich zones (Figure 3c). Electron diffraction is a very appropriate technique for the assessment of the crystallinity of various types of specimens at the nanometer level. As shown in Figure S15, the ZSM-5 grains give rise to a unique set of well-defined diffraction spots, allowing us to assign to these crystals a single crystalline structure. In contrast to the interpenetrated house-of-cards with a myriad intergrown plane prepared by a bottom-up approach, the single-crystal house-of-cards-like material reported here offers high crystallinity with a few framework defects left.
To shed light on the dissolution process and the general applicability of the method, we have employed a series of industrial ZSM-5 sample (see the Supporting Information). These samples exhibit different morphology and particle size (Figure S16), Si/Al ratio (Table S1), and level of aggregation. The samples were NH4F etched under similar conditions as the time of treatment was varied between 5 and 50 min. The product yield plotted against the etching time is presented in Figure S12. As can be seen, the dissolution rate depends on the crystal size; the larger the crystal size, the lower the dissolution rate. We relate this result with the accomplishment of the growth process. As discussed, the well-shaped crystals with terminated crystal faces show higher resistance to NH4F etching. On the other side, all of the trend lines show an initially faster dissolution rate and then converge, with an apparently lower dissolution rate, to a similar product yield value under the applied experimental conditions. This result shows that, no matter of basic zeolite crystal characteristics, the mechanism of dissolution is identical and the final product is similar (Figures 3 and S17).
Silicon selective alkaline etching also leads to a hierarchical zeolite, ZB (Figure 4a,b). It is a highly porous material with large variation of mesopore size and pore distribution. (31,35) Similarly to NH4F etching, the crystal morphology is retained (Figure 4a). However, a closer look reveals a grainlike morphology (Figure 4b), the result of preferential Si extraction and redeposition of most of the extracted Al on the etched surface. Such a biased Si etching changes the zeolite framework composition and acidity (Table 1).

ZNS displays a flowerlike morphology composed of interpenetrating platelike nanosheets (Figure 4c,d). The overall thickness of the lamellar stacking of nanosheets is 20–60 nm (Figure 4e). TEM reveals that the stacking “plate” is composed of alternating 2 nm-thick aluminosilicate nanosheets and 2.8 nm micellar layers (Figure 4f). This well-defined mesoporosity is inherently related to the properties of the structure-directing agent used.
2.1.4. IR Spectroscopy
Chemical analysis of ZP and ZNS indicates Si/Al ratios of 21 and 37, respectively. A negligible change in the Si/Al ratio after NH4F etching is observed, while caustic etching produces a material with a Si/Al ratio of 9 (Table 1). These results are expected for unbiased (NH4F) and biased (NaOH) etchings, respectively. (23) IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine highlights further these conclusions as ZB has a lower concentration of Brønsted acid sites and a substantial increase of Lewis acid sites compared to those of its parent ZP and its NH4F-etched derivative ZF (Table 1). ZF Brønsted acidity does not change significantly, as excepted. ZNS has a lower Brønsted acid sites concentration due to a higher Si/Al ratio and the presence of numerous silanols, vide infra. (44) The pristine surface of all samples can also be probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, namely, their ν(OH) region where isolated silanols (3747 cm–1) located on the external surface and bridged hydroxyls, i.e., Brønsted acid sites (3613 cm–1) are clearly observed (Figure 5). ZP shows such bands and a broad absorption extending from 3500 to 3000 cm–1 (Figure 5a), ascribed to H-bonded internal silanol nests. (45) The ZF spectra do not show such a broad band, and the baseline is almost flat, indicating that a substantial part of the silanols is eliminated during NH4F etching. Again, this is the result of a preferential dissolution of highly defective zones in the crystals, a typical characteristic of NH4F etching. (24,40) In ZF, the intensity of the 3747 cm–1 band increases compared to that of its parent ZP, indicative of an increased external surface area (Table 1). For ZB, the intensity of the 3747 cm–1 band further increases, whereas the 3613 cm–1 band decreases noticeably. The IR spectra of ZNS are dominated by external surface silanols at 3743 cm–1 (Figure 5a), whereas a very small amount of Brønsted acid sites is detected (Figure 5b).

The above results indicate that a ZSM-5 house-of-cards-like architecture, ZF, can be prepared by a top-down unbiased NH4F etching of ZSM-5. Single zeolite crystals are converted in a mosaic of connected rectangular cavities separated by nanometer-thick crystalline walls. Such walls are thicker than the house-of-cards obtained by a bottom-up approach, ZNS (Figures 3e–g and 4e,f). However, the aspect ratios between the wall thickness and mesopore space of both ZF and ZNS are similar. As mentioned, the formation of rectangular cavities is a consequence of the unbiased dissolution of highly defect zones and small crystalline domains mostly presented in zeolite crystals. Thus, an essential advantage of the top-down approach is that the “house” is a single crystal almost free of defect zones. A decrease of Lewis acid sites is observed, again a consequence of the preferential dissolution of defective portions of the crystals (Table 1), whereas the number of Brønsted acid sites is almost unchanged. The resulting house-of-cards-like material comprises relatively large meso- and macropores with a flat surface. Another essential feature of the house-of-cards-like material is the moderate increase in the external surface area and retention of micropore volume compared to the caustic leached ZSM-5. Nanosheet-like ZSM-5 also shows relatively low micropore volume. ZF differs substantially from the caustic leached zeolite produced from the same parent (ZB) and the nanosheet ZSM-5 (ZNS). In contrast, the preferential extraction of Si and redeposition of Al in the case of ZB results in a considerable increase of the external surface area at the expense of the micropore volume, dramatic changes in the chemical composition, and the acidic properties of the zeolite (Table 1). Nanosheet ZSM-5 also exhibits a huge external surface area and reduced micropore volume. It should be noted the very low Brønsted acidity of this material (Table 1) and the vast presence of surface silanols in this material (Figure 5). This series of catalysts with well-distinct physicochemical properties offers the possibility a structure–property relationship to be established.
2.2. Ethanol-to-Hydrocarbon (ETH) Conversion on ZB, ZF, and ZNS Zeolite Catalysts
ETH, like the methanol-to-hydrocarbon process, is a key step in the transformation of biomass, coal, natural gas, and heavy oils into olefins (major building blocks in petrochemistry) and higher hydrocarbons (gasoline fuel). (46) The performance of all of these four zeolites is evaluated in this reaction, as already discussed previously. (31) Ethanol is converted into water and light olefins as well as heavier hydrocarbons (3–18 carbon atoms). Small amounts of methane and ethane are detected but no CO and CO2. The yields are presented as molar % in the organic fraction (Figures 6 and 7). While ethanol dehydration can take place on weak acid sites, oligomerization, cyclization, and hydrogen transfer reactions require strong acid sites as found in zeolites. On all our catalysts, ethanol conversion is initially complete and decreases slowly with time-on-stream (Figure S18a). Therefore, the catalyst deactivation is related to the time evolution of the C3+ yield.

On the parent zeolite (Zp), the initial yield of C3+ is only 35% (extrapolated value at zero conversion) and decreases rapidly, becoming negligible after only 20 h (Figure 6). On ZB, the initial C3+ yield is slightly less than 100% (Figure 6), but the catalyst deactivates rapidly and yields almost no C3+ after 90 h on stream. On ZNS, the initial C3+ yield is lower than that of ZB but quite high considering its much lower Brønsted acid site concentration. However, its deactivation rate is much lower than that of ZB; after 90 h on stream, the C3+ yield decreases to ca. 20 mol %, whereas it was almost zero on ZB. The direct synthesis of a hierarchical zeolite using a complex surfactant is an efficient, albeit expensive, way of minimizing deactivation. ZF, although not the catalyst with the best initial C3+ yield, retains it much longer as it deactivates much slower than ZB and ZNS (Figure 6); after 90 h of TOS, it still produces a substantial C3+ yield, ca. 60 mol %.
The unbiased NH4F etching of a micrometer-sized ZSM-5 zeolite leads to a diffusion path length similar to that of nanosized one. Indeed, the stability of ZF is similar, or even higher for longer reaction time, to that on a commercial zeolite with a crystal size of 45 nm. (31) See also Figure S19 in the present work. The superior stability of ZF on a nanoscale zeolite can be related to both a high intracrystalline mesoporous volume (0.31 cm3 g–1) and quasi-perfect connectivity with the microporous network, a consequence of single-crystal nature of house-of-cards-like material. As ZF is devoid of defects, contrariwise on ZNS, the immobilization and growth of coke precursors are mitigated. Therefore, the catalyst is more stable. On the other hand, as the caustic leaching divides by only four the diffusion path length, as shown by the desorption experiments, (47) the gain in stability is rather limited.
The molar yields of the paraffins (P), olefins (O), naphthenes (N), and aromatics (A), as well as the paraffin-to-aromatic molar ratio (P/A), are reported as a function of the C3+ yield and time-on-stream in Figures 7 and S18b–f, respectively. As far as the product distribution is concerned ZP, ZNS, and ZP give the same product selectivity for the same C3+ yield, meaning that the reactions involved are identical, even during the deactivation and regardless of the acid properties of the three catalysts. It is worth noting that a difference exists only on ZB with a yield in O3+. Yields in N and O3+ pass through a high yielding maximum in C3+, whereas those in P and A increase exponentially. Regardless of the C3+ yield, the paraffin-to-aromatic molar ratio (P/A) is ca. 3 (Figure 7e), indicative of hydrogen transfer between naphthenes and olefins (Scheme 1). The initial low value of the P/A ratio (open symbol in Figure 7e) is due to coke formation.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Hydrogen Transfer Reaction between Naphthenes and Olefins
In sharp contrast, ZF shows considerably higher aromatic and naphthene yields than those of ZB and ZNS, whereas its paraffin yield is low (Figure 7a,c,d). Apparently, hydrogen transfer reactions are substantially suppressed in this catalyst. Its P/A is lower than 0.5 (Figure 7e), implying that on the NH4F-treated zeolite aromatics are formed by a monomolecular protolytic dehydrogenation. Lercher and co-workers (48) have shown that a high ratio of Brønsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites (BAS/LAS) minimizes the alkenes concentration and causes high hydride transfer (HT) activity. Yet, on the ZF catalyst, HT is limited, although the house-of-cards-like catalyst possesses the highest BAS/LAS ratio. Lercher et al. (49) also demonstrated that the rate-determining step for dehydrogenation activity of alkane on H-ZSM-5 is represented by olefin desorption from the catalyst surface, which is promoted by a short diffusion path length. It is worth mentioning that the products selectivity of ZF is very close to that of nanometer-sized ZSM-5 zeolite (Figure S20), confirming that the diffusion path length is limited to a few nanometers on both zeolites.
The coke content, the evolution of the number of acid sites (Brønsted and Lewis), and pore volumes accessible to nitrogen after more than 48 h of reaction are gathered in Table 2. The coke content is around 13 wt % on ZP after 48 h of reaction. NH4F etching has no impact on the coke level, whereas on the alkaline-leached ZB catalyst, coke grows continuously to reach a level almost twice as high as that of its parent. On ZNS, although its Brønsted acid site concentration is 4 times lower than on ZP, the coke content is quite similar. The residual acidity (Brønsted and Lewis), after deactivation, is very low for all samples. An important decrease of micropore volume occurs on all zeolites. On ZNS, which is the least acidic catalyst, the loss of microporosity is only 25%. The coked ZF and ZNS catalysts, despite a near total loss of acidity, keep converting ethanol to C3+ hydrocarbons (∼60 and ∼20%, respectively, Figure 6); ethanol transformation occurs probably by pore mouth catalysis on hybrid active sites (immobilized carbocations) by a carbon pool mechanism.

Differences in the activity and stability among ZP, ZB, ZF, and ZNS are related to changes in the carbon pool composition. The composition of the coke trapped in the zeolite micropores, i.e., internal coke, is determined by mineralizing the zeolite and subsequently analyzing the organic phase after liquid–liquid extraction with CH2Cl2. (50) (50) Coke molecules can be lumped in four families according to their number of aromatic rings: alkylbenzenes (I), alkyl naphthalenes (II), alkyl-phenanthrenes or -anthracenes (III), and alkylpyrenes (IV). The sizes of all compounds trapped in the micropores vary between the dimensions of the pore openings (0.55 nm) and channel intersections (∼1 nm) of H-ZSM-5. The coke on ZP and ZB contain representatives of all families. A simpler and lighter coke distribution is found on ZF and ZNS, where families I and III dominate (Figure S21); such a coke composition is similar to that reported elsewhere for nanosized zeolite. (31) The average molar mass of coke trapped in the micropores, calculated from these compositions, is 200 g mol–1 for ZP and ZB and 180 g mol–1 for ZF and ZNS.
Taking this average molar mass of 200 g mol–1 for the coke molecules trapped inside the micropores (ca. 13 wt % on the ZP catalysts), its concentration is ca. 645 mol g–1, corresponding to the amount of Brønsted acid sites on the fresh zeolite. Coking is therefore mainly a site poisoning effect, further confirmed by a complete disappearance of the bridged OH groups (Figure S22). Assuming that on all hierarchical zeolites one coke molecule poisons only one protonic site, the coke trapped within the micropores and that located in the mesopores can be estimated. The results are reported in the bar chart in Figure 8. The most significant accumulations of coke on the mesopores are for the caustic leached micron-sized zeolite (ZB) and the nanosheet zeolite (ZNS), reaching up to 55% and ca. 75% of the total coke; on the other hand, it is limited to 16% on the catalyst free of defect (ZF) and, as expected, almost zero on the parent zeolite. The accumulation of coke in mesopores is likely related to the quality of the crystals. The increased number of silanols and Lewis acid sites on ZB and ZNS are prone to trap-desorbed products, (51−53) as confirmed by the disappearance of silanol groups on spent catalysts (Figure S22). Taking a coke density of 1.1 g cm–3, the volume of coke in the micropores corresponds to the loss of micropore volume measured by nitrogen adsorption (Figure 8). These calculated values are very close to the experimental data, highlighting the relevance of this procedure to discriminate between internal and external coke contents.

In addition, the coke light-off performances of the spent catalysts are compared in Table 2, wherein temperatures required to combust 50% (T50) and 90% (T90) of the coke are reported. T50 and T90 are both lower on ZB than on ZP (−35 and −25 °C, respectively) and much lower on ZNS and ZF (−55 °C). The differences are related to a higher accessibility (diffusion) of oxygen to the coke molecules trapped in the micropores. The house-of-cards-like zeolite, already the best catalyst (cumulative performance due to its time stability), is as good as a nanosheet one for regeneration.
The ETH reaction illustrates the superior stability and selectivity of ZF, a house-of-cards-like ZSM-5 catalyst, although other hierarchical zeolites ZB and ZNS possess higher external surface area and mesopore volume. The nanosheet zeolite ZNS with a higher Si/Al ratio of 37 and a lower acid site density displays a remarkably high initial C3+ yield and was once expected to be a superior candidate for ETH reactions (54) but lacks stability as shown in this study. The ZF catalyst outperforms both ZB and ZNS in the present study (Figure 6). Zeolite acidity and mesoporosity cannot alone fully explain the differences in catalytic performances discussed above. Based on our detailed comparison of the hierarchical zeolites, we propose that, in addition to mesopore size, shape, uptake capacity, and connectivity, the quality of the hierarchical zeolites (micropore accessibility, absence of defects [silanol nests], and Lewis acidity) also play important roles in the ETH reaction. The higher catalytic performances of NH4F leached zeolites could also be related to their ability to dehydrogenate naphthenic compounds (Figure 7); this monomolecular reaction requires less space than the bimolecular hydrogen transfer occurring on the caustic leached zeolite and nanosheet zeolite. The absence of defects combined with a small diffusion path length inside the microporosity by retarding the transformation of the desired active carbon pool to unwanted coke slows catalyst deactivation. The presence of numerous silanol groups, on the other hand, traps coke precursors on the surface, promoting rapid catalyst deactivation by a fast accumulation of aromatic compounds. Indeed, as coke formation is a genuine shape-selective reaction, the availability of more space favors the production of larger molecules, coke, i.e., an inactive carbon pool. These results highlight that, in addition to the loosely defined “mesopore quality”, (21) the surface quality of the remaining microporous crystal domains determines the catalytic performance of hierarchically structured zeolite crystals.
3. Conclusions
Single-crystal house-of-cards-like ZSM-5 was prepared by a top-down approach using a novel unbiased chemical etching with an NH4F solution. Such an etching extracts Si and Al at similar rates and preferentially removes less-stable defect zones in the crystals. The process is therefore controlled by the number of intergrowths, the structural stress, and the nanocrystalline domains with well-defined grain boundaries, i.e., the history of the zeolite synthesis. Such a unique dissolution behavior is inherently related to the growth process where simultaneous monomer-by-monomer addition and oriented attachment take place. (42) The unbiased NH4F dissolution leads to the preferential extraction of misoriented and more vulnerable to chemical attack nanocrystalline domains followed by progressive etching of the remaining part of the crystals, which is more resistant due to the limited number of structural defects. This dissolution proceeds by a layer-by-layer mechanism following the rectangular features of previously extracted nanodomains; thus, the well-shaped cavities grow in size and connect to each other, providing a house-of-cards-like morphology.
Such a hierarchical material is analogous to a collection of nanosized high-quality crystals with the same framework composition and Brønsted acidity as those of their parent. The high accessibility and short diffusion path length offered by the house-of-cards-like morphology are therefore combined with the intact native microporosity and acidity of their parent zeolite and do not require expensive and one-off structure-directing agents. The optimization of structural and chemical parameters results in an excellent catalyst easier to regenerate, as demonstrated in the challenging (deactivation prone) ethanol-to-hydrocarbon reaction. Indeed, regenerating deactivated catalysts by controlled coke combustion often leads to, often overlooked, irreversible changes due to the operating conditions (such an exothermic reaction produces steam near the zeolite active sites and can lead to structural and chemical damages such as dealumination) of this step. The performance of such single-crystal house-of-cards-like catalysts is so far second to none as it maintains its performance over longer periods of time and appears easier to regenerate, which even outperforms the nanometer-sized zeolites (Figure S19). Noting that we have previously concluded, based on the samples studied, that the reduction of crystal size is the most efficient way to increase the performance of zeolites for applications such as alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion, and hence, nanozeolites are preferred. (31)
This study highlights that hierarchical zeolitic catalysts with superior performances can be designed not only by promoting high accessibility and short diffusion to and from their active sites but also by retaining the crystallinity and acidity of their parents while keeping a minimum level of defects. Since the presence of crystalline domains with well-defined grain boundaries is a ubiquitous in zeolite materials, the preparation of single-crystal house-of cards can be extended to other zeolite types. Further insights into the hierarchization process of zeolites, either bottom-up or top-down (this work), hold much potential to design ever better zeolite catalysts for current and forthcoming applications.
