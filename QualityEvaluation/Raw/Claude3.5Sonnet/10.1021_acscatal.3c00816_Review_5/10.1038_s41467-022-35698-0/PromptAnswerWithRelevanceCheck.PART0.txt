Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their synthesis methods, or their application in PDH reactions. The document focuses on the role of adsorbed water in the formation of highly dispersed tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites on silica supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It does not discuss zeolites or hierarchical porous materials. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献中没有包含任何关于分级沸石、其合成方法或在PDH反应中应用的信息。该文档主要关注吸附水在硅胶支撑剂上形成高度分散的四面体钴(II)位点用于丙烷脱氢催化剂的作用。它没有讨论沸石或分级多孔材料。因此,无法根据所提供的文本回答这个问题。
