Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores for PDH reactions. The document focuses on ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated zeolite β as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolites or their synthesis methods. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有关于层级化沸石结合微孔和介孔/大孔用于PDH反应的信息。该文档主要讨论了负载在脱铝β沸石上的ZnO纳米簇作为丙烷脱氢催化剂，但没有涉及层级化沸石或其合成方法。因此，无法根据所提供的文本回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not discuss hierarchical zeolites or their use in PDH reactions. The document focuses on zinc oxide nanoclusters supported on dealuminated beta zeolite for propane dehydrogenation, but does not mention hierarchical zeolites combining micropores and mesopores/macropores. Without relevant information in the provided text, I cannot answer the question about hierarchical zeolites, their types, synthesis methods, or performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献没有讨论分级孔道沸石或其在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。文档主要集中讨论了脱铝β沸石负载的氧化锌纳米簇用于丙烷脱氢,但没有提到结合微孔和介孔/大孔的分级孔道沸石。由于提供的文本中没有相关信息,我无法回答关于分级孔道沸石、其类型、合成方法或与传统沸石相比在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能的问题。
