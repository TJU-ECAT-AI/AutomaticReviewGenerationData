The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about hierarchical zeolites, their combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores, types and synthesis methods, or their performance in PDH reactions. The abstract appears to be about impregnating metallic nanocatalysts into zeolite nanosheets, but does not discuss hierarchical zeolites or PDH reactions specifically. Without additional information, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided text.

给定的文献中没有包含任何与回答层级沸石、它们的微孔和介孔/大孔组合、类型和合成方法,或它们在PDH反应中的性能相关的信息。摘要似乎是关于将金属纳米催化剂浸渍到沸石纳米片中,但并未具体讨论层级沸石或PDH反应。没有额外的信息,仅基于所提供的文本无法充分回答这个问题。
