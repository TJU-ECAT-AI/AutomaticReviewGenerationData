Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their combination of micropores and mesopores/macropores, types, synthesis methods, or their performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions compared to traditional zeolites. The text appears to be a title and author list for a research article about silicalite-1 and zinc-hydride species in propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide any content related to the specific question asked.

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their pore structure, synthesis methods, or performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The text appears to be only a title and author list for a research article about silicalite-1 and zinc-hydride species in propane dehydrogenation. Without additional content from the full article, it is not possible to answer the question about hierarchical zeolites and their role in PDH reactions.
