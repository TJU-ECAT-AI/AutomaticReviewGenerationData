[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1. The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst."

[2] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."

[3] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability. Since the two catalysts did not contain any Ga, the increased catalytic lifetime is not attributable to the Ga effect, but rather to the Pt-Y alloying effect promoted by silanol nests as proposed in our earlier work."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area from micropores and improved mass transport from larger pores. The main types discussed in this literature are mesoporous MFI zeolites, particularly MZ-sf-Br, MZ-sf-OH, MZ-sc, and MZ-dg.

The synthesis methods include sodium-free synthesis using diammonium-type bromide surfactants, post-synthetic degallation, and synthesis under sodium-containing conditions. The sodium-free synthesis method is highlighted as producing zeolites with silanol nests, which promote the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles.

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by enhancing catalytic durability and lifetime. The mesoporous structure allows for better dispersion of metal nanoparticles and improved access to active sites. The presence of silanol nests in the sodium-free synthesized zeolites (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) promoted the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibited superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional Pt catalysts or even the degallated mesoporous zeolite (MZ-dg).

分级沸石通过结合微孔和介孔/大孔来增强PDH反应的可及性,微孔提供高比表面积,而较大的孔道改善了质量传输。本文献中讨论的主要类型是介孔MFI沸石,特别是MZ-sf-Br、MZ-sf-OH、MZ-sc和MZ-dg。

合成方法包括使用二铵型溴化物表面活性剂的无钠合成、后合成脱镓和含钠条件下的合成。无钠合成方法被强调可以生产具有硅醇巢的沸石,这种硅醇巢促进了Pt-Y合金纳米粒子的形成。

与传统沸石相比,这些分级沸石通过增强催化耐久性和寿命来改善PDH反应性能。介孔结构允许金属纳米粒子更好地分散并改善了对活性位点的可及性。无钠合成的沸石(MZ-sf-Br和MZ-sf-OH)中存在的硅醇巢促进了Pt-Y合金纳米粒子的形成,这些粒子在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优于传统Pt催化剂甚至脱镓介孔沸石(MZ-dg)的催化性能。
