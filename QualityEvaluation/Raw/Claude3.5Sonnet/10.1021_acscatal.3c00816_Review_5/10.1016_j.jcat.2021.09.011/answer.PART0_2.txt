[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1. The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst."

[2] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1 b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification [45]. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."

[3] "Mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y catalyst deactivates slowly in propane dehydrogenation, maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, but the formation of the intermetallic compound requires atomistic migration of yttrium through silanol nests on the zeolite."

[4] "Compared to the cumbersome generation of silanols via framework demetallation, we report a direct synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores of the MFI zeolite structure offer shape selectivity and active sites, while the mesopores formed between zeolite nanosheets improve mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this study are mesoporous MFI zeolites, synthesized through different methods:

1. MZ-dg: obtained by post-synthetic degallation from a gallosilicate form of mesoporous zeolite
2. MZ-sc: synthesized using sodium silicate and C1864Br2 surfactant under sodium-containing conditions
3. MZ-sf-OH: synthesized using TEOS and C1864(OH)2 surfactant under sodium-free conditions
4. MZ-sf-Br: synthesized using TEOS, C1864Br2 surfactant, and TMAOH under sodium-free conditions

The synthesis methods focus on creating mesoporous MFI zeolites with silanol nests, which are important for the formation of intermetallic compounds like Pt3Y. The sodium-free synthesis methods (MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br) are highlighted as more efficient alternatives to post-synthetic demetallation for generating silanol nests.

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Providing better accessibility to active sites through the mesoporous structure
2. Facilitating the formation of Pt3Y intermetallic compounds through silanol nests
3. Enhancing catalyst durability and maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity
4. Reducing catalyst deactivation rates due to improved mass transfer and coke resistance

The mesoporous structure and silanol nests in these hierarchical zeolites contribute to the formation of well-dispersed, stable Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional zeolite-supported catalysts.

分级沸石通过提供双孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。MFI沸石结构的微孔提供形状选择性和活性位点，而沸石纳米片之间形成的介孔改善了传质和活性位点的可及性。

本研究中讨论的主要分级沸石类型是介孔MFI沸石，通过不同方法合成：

1. MZ-dg：通过对介孔沸石的镓硅酸盐形式进行后合成脱镓获得
2. MZ-sc：使用硅酸钠和C1864Br2表面活性剂在含钠条件下合成
3. MZ-sf-OH：使用TEOS和C1864(OH)2表面活性剂在无钠条件下合成
4. MZ-sf-Br：使用TEOS、C1864Br2表面活性剂和TMAOH在无钠条件下合成

这些合成方法专注于创建具有硅醇巢的介孔MFI沸石，这对于形成Pt3Y等金属间化合物很重要。无钠合成方法（MZ-sf-OH和MZ-sf-Br）被强调为生成硅醇巢的更有效替代方法，相比后合成脱金属化。

这些分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能，相比传统沸石：

1. 通过介孔结构提供更好的活性位点可及性
2. 通过硅醇巢促进Pt3Y金属间化合物的形成
3. 增强催化剂耐久性，保持高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性
4. 由于改善的传质和抗积碳性，降低催化剂失活速率

这些分级沸石中的介孔结构和硅醇巢有助于形成分散良好、稳定的Pt3Y合金纳米粒子，在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优于传统沸石负载催化剂的催化性能。
