[1] "The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst. The three other samples were prepared for the purpose of comparison."

[2] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1."

[3] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."

[4] "The formation of tiny metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in MZ"

[5] "PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores in the MFI zeolite structure allow for molecular sieving and shape selectivity, while the mesopores provide improved mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this study are mesoporous MFI zeolites. Four different synthesis methods were described:

1. MZ-dg: Synthesized as gallosilicate and then degallated
2. MZ-sc: Synthesized using sodium silicate under sodium-containing conditions
3. MZ-sf-OH: Synthesized using TEOS and C1864(OH)2 under sodium-free conditions
4. MZ-sf-Br: Synthesized using TEOS, C1864Br2, and TMAOH under sodium-free conditions

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Enhanced accessibility: The mesopores allow better diffusion of reactants and products.
2. Improved catalyst dispersion: The mesopores provide confinement effects for forming small metal nanoparticles.
3. Increased catalytic durability: PtY catalysts supported on mesoporous MFI zeolites, especially those synthesized under sodium-free conditions (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH), showed superior catalytic durability compared to degallated zeolites.
4. Better coke resistance: The hierarchical structure may help in reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity.

Overall, the combination of micropores and mesopores in these hierarchical zeolites leads to improved catalytic performance, stability, and longevity in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.

分级沸石通过提供双孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，以增强PDH反应的可及性。MFI沸石结构中的微孔允许分子筛选和形状选择性，而介孔提供了改善的质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

本研究讨论的主要分级沸石类型是介孔MFI沸石。描述了四种不同的合成方法：

1. MZ-dg：合成为镓硅酸盐，然后脱镓
2. MZ-sc：在含钠条件下使用硅酸钠合成
3. MZ-sf-OH：在无钠条件下使用TEOS和C1864(OH)2合成
4. MZ-sf-Br：在无钠条件下使用TEOS、C1864Br2和TMAOH合成

这些分级沸石相比传统沸石在多个方面改善了PDH反应性能：

1. 增强的可及性：介孔允许反应物和产物更好地扩散。
2. 改善的催化剂分散：介孔为形成小金属纳米颗粒提供了限制效应。
3. 提高的催化耐久性：负载在介孔MFI沸石上的PtY催化剂，特别是那些在无钠条件下合成的（MZ-sf-Br和MZ-sf-OH），表现出优于脱镓沸石的催化耐久性。
4. 更好的抗焦性：分级结构可能有助于减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂寿命。

总的来说，这些分级沸石中微孔和介孔的组合导致了PDH反应中催化性能、稳定性和寿命的改善，相比传统沸石更为优越。
