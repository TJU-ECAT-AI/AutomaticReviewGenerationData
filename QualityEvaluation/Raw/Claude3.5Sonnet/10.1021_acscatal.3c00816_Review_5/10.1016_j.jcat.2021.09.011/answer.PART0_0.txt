[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1. The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst."

[2] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1 b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification [45]. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."

[3] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability. Since the two catalysts did not contain any Ga, the increased catalytic lifetime is not attributable to the Ga effect [58], [59], [60], but rather to the Pt-Y alloying effect promoted by silanol nests as proposed in our earlier work."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores offer shape selectivity and high surface area, while the mesopores/macropores improve mass transfer and reduce diffusion limitations.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this literature are mesoporous MFI zeolites. The synthesis methods mentioned include:

1. Post-synthetic degallation (MZ-dg)
2. Sodium-containing synthesis (MZ-sc)
3. Sodium-free synthesis with C1864(OH)2 surfactant (MZ-sf-OH)
4. Sodium-free synthesis with C1864Br2 surfactant and TMAOH (MZ-sf-Br)

These hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Providing better accessibility to active sites
2. Enhancing catalytic durability
3. Promoting the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles when supported with Pt and Y
4. Allowing for higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity
5. Reducing catalyst deactivation rates

The sodium-free synthesis method (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) was found to be particularly effective in creating silanol nests, which promote the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles. These alloy nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

分级沸石通过提供双孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。微孔提供形状选择性和高比表面积，而介孔/大孔改善了物质传递并减少了扩散限制。

本文献中讨论的主要分级沸石类型是介孔MFI沸石。提到的合成方法包括：

1. 后合成脱镓（MZ-dg）
2. 含钠合成（MZ-sc）
3. 使用C1864(OH)2表面活性剂的无钠合成（MZ-sf-OH）
4. 使用C1864Br2表面活性剂和TMAOH的无钠合成（MZ-sf-Br）

与传统沸石相比，这些分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应的性能：

1. 提供更好的活性位点可及性
2. 增强催化耐久性
3. 在负载Pt和Y时促进Pt-Y合金纳米颗粒的形成
4. 允许更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性
5. 降低催化剂失活速率

无钠合成方法（MZ-sf-Br和MZ-sf-OH）被发现特别有效，可以创建硅醇巢，促进金属间Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒的形成。这些合金纳米颗粒在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高催化耐久性，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
