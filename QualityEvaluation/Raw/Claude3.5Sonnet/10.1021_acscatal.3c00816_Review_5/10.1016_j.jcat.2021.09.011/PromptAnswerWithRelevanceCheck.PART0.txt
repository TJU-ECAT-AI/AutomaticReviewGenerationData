[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1. The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst."

[2] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1 b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification [45]. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."

[3] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability. Since the two catalysts did not contain any Ga, the increased catalytic lifetime is not attributable to the Ga effect [58], [59], [60], but rather to the Pt-Y alloying effect promoted by silanol nests as proposed in our earlier work."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores offer shape selectivity and high surface area, while the mesopores/macropores improve mass transfer and reduce diffusion limitations.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this literature are mesoporous MFI zeolites. The synthesis methods mentioned include:

1. Post-synthetic degallation (MZ-dg)
2. Sodium-containing synthesis (MZ-sc)
3. Sodium-free synthesis with C1864(OH)2 surfactant (MZ-sf-OH)
4. Sodium-free synthesis with C1864Br2 surfactant and TMAOH (MZ-sf-Br)

These hierarchical zeolites improve the performance of PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Providing better accessibility to active sites
2. Enhancing catalytic durability
3. Promoting the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles when supported with Pt and Y
4. Allowing for higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity
5. Reducing catalyst deactivation rates

The sodium-free synthesis method (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) was found to be particularly effective in creating silanol nests, which promote the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles. These alloy nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing both high surface area from micropores and improved mass transport from larger pores. The main types discussed in this literature are mesoporous MFI zeolites, particularly MZ-sf-Br, MZ-sf-OH, MZ-sc, and MZ-dg.

The synthesis methods include sodium-free synthesis using diammonium-type bromide surfactants, post-synthetic degallation, and synthesis under sodium-containing conditions. The sodium-free synthesis method is highlighted as producing zeolites with silanol nests, which promote the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles.

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by enhancing catalytic durability and lifetime. The mesoporous structure allows for better dispersion of metal nanoparticles and improved access to active sites. The presence of silanol nests in the sodium-free synthesized zeolites (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH) promoted the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibited superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional Pt catalysts or even the degallated mesoporous zeolite (MZ-dg).

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores of the MFI zeolite structure offer shape selectivity and active sites, while the mesopores formed between zeolite nanosheets improve mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this study are mesoporous MFI zeolites, synthesized through different methods:

1. MZ-dg: obtained by post-synthetic degallation from a gallosilicate form of mesoporous zeolite
2. MZ-sc: synthesized using sodium silicate and C1864Br2 surfactant under sodium-containing conditions
3. MZ-sf-OH: synthesized using TEOS and C1864(OH)2 surfactant under sodium-free conditions
4. MZ-sf-Br: synthesized using TEOS, C1864Br2 surfactant, and TMAOH under sodium-free conditions

The synthesis methods focus on creating mesoporous MFI zeolites with silanol nests, which are important for the formation of intermetallic compounds like Pt3Y. The sodium-free synthesis methods (MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br) are highlighted as more efficient alternatives to post-synthetic demetallation for generating silanol nests.

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Providing better accessibility to active sites through the mesoporous structure
2. Facilitating the formation of Pt3Y intermetallic compounds through silanol nests
3. Enhancing catalyst durability and maintaining high propane conversion and propylene selectivity
4. Reducing catalyst deactivation rates due to improved mass transfer and coke resistance

The mesoporous structure and silanol nests in these hierarchical zeolites contribute to the formation of well-dispersed, stable Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional zeolite-supported catalysts.

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores in the MFI zeolite structure allow for molecular sieving and shape selectivity, while the mesopores provide improved mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this study are mesoporous MFI zeolites. Four different synthesis methods were described:

1. MZ-dg: Synthesized as gallosilicate and then degallated
2. MZ-sc: Synthesized using sodium silicate under sodium-containing conditions
3. MZ-sf-OH: Synthesized using TEOS and C1864(OH)2 under sodium-free conditions
4. MZ-sf-Br: Synthesized using TEOS, C1864Br2, and TMAOH under sodium-free conditions

These hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites in several ways:

1. Enhanced accessibility: The mesopores allow better diffusion of reactants and products.
2. Improved catalyst dispersion: The mesopores provide confinement effects for forming small metal nanoparticles.
3. Increased catalytic durability: PtY catalysts supported on mesoporous MFI zeolites, especially those synthesized under sodium-free conditions (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH), showed superior catalytic durability compared to degallated zeolites.
4. Better coke resistance: The hierarchical structure may help in reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity.

Overall, the combination of micropores and mesopores in these hierarchical zeolites leads to improved catalytic performance, stability, and longevity in PDH reactions compared to traditional zeolites.
