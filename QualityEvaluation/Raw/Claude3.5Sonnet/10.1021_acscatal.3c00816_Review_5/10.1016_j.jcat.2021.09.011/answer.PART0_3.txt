[1] "Four different mesoporous MFI zeolite samples were obtained according to the synthesis methods described in Section 2.1. The MZ-sf-Br sample is the main sample of interest in the present work as a support material for the PtY PDH catalyst."

[2] "The N2 adsorption isotherms of the four mesoporous zeolites in Fig. 1b were all of Type IV according to the IUPAC classification. These isotherms commonly exhibited a steep increase in the amount of N2 adsorption as the pressure increased to P/P0 = 0.05. This jump in the low-pressure region was assignable to the micropore filling in the MFI zeolite by N2. There was another jump in the adsorption amount in the range of P/P0 = 0.450.7. This was due to the capillary condensation in the slit-shape mesopores that are formed between the neighboring zeolite nanosheets."

[3] "The formation of tiny metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in MZ"

[4] "The PDH catalytic performance of the four PtY(0.5)/MZ samples was measured at 853 K using a fixed bed reactor with a propane flow at WHSV = 5.5 h1. Neat propane gas was used without the addition of diluent gas (N2 or H2), to accelerate the catalytic deactivation process within a short period."

[5] "all of the PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on the group of defect-containing zeolites [i.e., PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br, PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH, and PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg] exhibited a dramatic improvement in the catalytic lifetime due to the Y addition (i.e., the effect of Pt-Y alloy formation)."

Hierarchical zeolites combine micropores and mesopores/macropores to enhance accessibility for PDH reactions by providing a dual pore system. The micropores in the MFI zeolite framework allow for shape selectivity and catalytic activity, while the mesopores formed between zeolite nanosheets improve mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

The main types of hierarchical zeolites discussed in this study are mesoporous MFI zeolites, specifically MZ-sf-Br, MZ-sf-OH, MZ-sc, and MZ-dg. These materials are synthesized using different methods, including sodium-free conditions (MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH), sodium-containing conditions (MZ-sc), and post-synthetic degallation (MZ-dg).

The hierarchical zeolites improve PDH reaction performance compared to traditional zeolites by:

1. Providing better dispersion and confinement of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores.
2. Enhancing mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.
3. Allowing for the formation of Pt-Y alloy nanoparticles when supported on defect-containing zeolites, which dramatically improves catalytic lifetime.
4. Enabling high propane conversion and propylene selectivity over extended periods.

The study demonstrates that hierarchical zeolites, particularly those synthesized under sodium-free conditions, can significantly enhance the performance and durability of PDH catalysts compared to traditional zeolites.

分级沸石通过提供双孔系统来结合微孔和介孔/大孔，从而增强PDH反应的可及性。MFI沸石骨架中的微孔提供了形状选择性和催化活性，而在沸石纳米片之间形成的介孔则改善了物质传递和活性位点的可及性。

本研究中讨论的主要分级沸石类型是介孔MFI沸石，特别是MZ-sf-Br、MZ-sf-OH、MZ-sc和MZ-dg。这些材料使用不同的方法合成，包括无钠条件（MZ-sf-Br和MZ-sf-OH）、含钠条件（MZ-sc）和后合成脱镓（MZ-dg）。

与传统沸石相比，分级沸石通过以下方式改善PDH反应性能：

1. 在介孔内提供更好的金属纳米粒子分散和限制。
2. 增强物质传递和活性位点的可及性。
3. 当负载在含缺陷的沸石上时，允许形成Pt-Y合金纳米粒子，这显著改善了催化寿命。
4. 在长时间内实现高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

研究表明，分级沸石，特别是在无钠条件下合成的沸石，与传统沸石相比，可以显著提高PDH催化剂的性能和耐久性。
