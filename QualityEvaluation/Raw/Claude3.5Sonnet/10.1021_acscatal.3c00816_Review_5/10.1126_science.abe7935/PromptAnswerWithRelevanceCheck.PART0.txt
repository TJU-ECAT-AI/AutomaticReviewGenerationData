Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about hierarchical zeolites, their types, synthesis methods, or their application in PDH reactions. The document focuses on boron-doped silicate zeolites for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), but does not discuss hierarchical structures or traditional PDH reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有包含任何关于分级zeolites、它们的类型、合成方法或在PDH反应中的应用的信息。该文档主要讨论了用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的硼掺杂硅酸盐沸石,但没有涉及分层结构或传统的PDH反应。因此,无法根据所提供的文本回答这个问题。
