The adsorption and reactions of propane over Mo2C deposited on
ZSM-5 and SiO2 have been investigated. Propane adsorbed weakly
and nondissociatively on Mo2C catalyst at 150273 K. At higher
temperatures, the characteristic vibrations of π-bonded and di-σ-
bonded propylene and propylidyne were identified by Fourier trans-
form infrared spectroscopy. The dominant reaction of propane over
Mo2C/SiO2 at 773873 K is its dehydrogenation into propylene. At
873 K the selectivity of propylene formation attained a value of 35
50% at a conversion of 3525%. The reaction pathway of propane
was completely different on Mo2C/ZSM-5: in this case the aroma-
tization of propane was the main process. It was shown that Mo2C
improved the effect of pure ZSM-5 in this reaction. The positive
influence of Mo2C is explained by its high activity toward the de-
hydrogenation of propane. The effect of Mo2C was also examined
on the aromatization of propylene occurring on the acidic sites of
ZSM-5, and no inhibition was observed.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recently it was found that Mo2C deposited on ZSM-5
is an effective catalyst in the high-temperature conversion
of methane into benzene (110). In order to establish the
possible routes of the aromatization of methane, the reac-
tions of ethane (11, 12) and ethylene (13) were also investi-
gated on this catalyst. In addition, the chemistry of the pos-
sible reaction intermediates, CH2, CH3, and C2H5, formed
in the activation of the above compounds was also exam-
ined on an Mo2C/Mo(100) surface in an UHV system by
means of several electron spectroscopic methods (14, 15).
As we can also count the transient formation of propane
and propylene during the aromatization of methane and
ethane, we undertake the study of the catalytic transfor-
mation of propane and propylene on Mo2C deposited on
ZSM-5 and SiO2.

Material Science at University of Szeged.
The reactions of propane on pure and promoted ZSM-5
were the subject of extensive research in the past decade
(1620). The most important features and results are sum-
marized in a review paper (20). The reaction of propane
over HZSM-5 becomes significant above 700 K. Benzene,
toluene, and xylenes account for most of the aromatics pro-
duced. Addition of Zn or Ga enhanced the conversion of
propane and increased the yield of aromatics (20).
The primary aim of the present work is to establish the
reaction pathways of propane over Mo2C/SiO2 and to as-
certain the influence of Mo2C on the catalytic performance
of ZSM-5 in the reactions of propane.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Materials
The gases used were of commercial purity (Linde). Ar
(99.996) and H2 (99.999) were deoxygenated with an oxy-
trap. HZSM-5 was obtained by five-times-repeated ion ex-
change of NaZSM-5 (Si/Al = 55.0) with an aqueous solu-
tion of ammonium nitrate (1 N), and calcined in air at 863 K
for 5 h. The surface area of the sample was 311 m2/g. SiO2
was Cab-O-Sil, area 200 m2/g.
Hexagonal Mo2C was prepared by the method of Lee
et al. (21). Briefly, about 0.7 g of MoO3 was heated in a
1 : 4 methaneH2 mixture flowing at 300 ml (STP)/min in a
quartz cell with two stopcocks. The preparation tempera-
ture was increased rapidly to 773 K and then at 3 K/min
from 773 to 1023 K and maintained at 1023 K for 3 h.
The BET surface area of this sample is 9.6 m2/g. MoO3-
containing catalysts were prepared by impregnating SiO2 or
HZSM-5 with a basic solution of ammonium paramolyb-
date to yield a nominal 2 wt% of MoO3. The suspension
was dried at 373 K and calcined at 863 K for 5 h. Supported
Mo2C catalysts were prepared by the carburation of cal-
cined MoO3/ZSM-5 or MoO3/SiO2 in the catalytic reactor,
in a way similar to that described above for the preparation
of bulk Mo2C. Before catalytic measurements each Mo2C
sample was treated in an H2 stream at 873 K for 120 min
in situ to remove the excess carbon and then flushed with
Ar for 15 min.

2.2. Methods
The samples were characterized by XPS measurements
(5). The binding energies for Mo(3d5/2) and Mo(3d3/2) were
227.8 and 231.0 eV, and for C(1s) 283.8 eV. These values are
close to the values attributed to Mo2C (22, 23).
Catalytic reactions were carried out at 1 atm of pres-
sure in a fixed-bed, continuous-flow reactor consisting of
a quartz tube (14 mm i.d.) connected to a capillary tube.
The flow rate was 12 ml/min. The carrier gas was Ar. The
propane content was 12.5%. Generally 0.5 g of loosely com-
pressed catalyst sample was used. Reaction products were
analyzed gas chromatographically using a Hewlett-Packard
5890 gas chromatograph and a Porapak QS column. The
propane conversion was calculated on the basis of carbon
number. The selectivity values of product formation repre-
sent the fraction of propane that has been converted into
specific products taking into account the number of carbon
atoms in the molecules:
conversion = number of moles of propane consumed
number of moles of propane fed
Selectivity to a given hydrocarbon = (number of moles
of the hydrocarbon produced) × (number of C atoms in the
molecular formula)/(number of moles of propane consum-
ed) × 3. Yield of a given hydrocarbon = (number of moles
of the hydrocarbon produced) × (number of C atoms in the
molecular formula)/(number of moles of propane fed) × 3.
Infrared spectra were recorded with a Bio-Rad Fourier
transform IR spectrometer (FTS 155) with a wavenumber
accuracy of 4 cm1. Typically 136 scans were collected.
For IR measurements the catalyst samples were pressed
into a 10- × 30-mm self-supporting wafer, and the carbu-
ration was performed in the infrared cell. Note that in the
case of ZSM-5-containing catalyst we had great difficulty in
preparing a stable, self-supporting plate. The supplemen-
tary method used was temperature-programmed desorp-
tion (TPD). The heating rate was 5 K/min.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Interaction of C3H8 with Supported Mo2C
The interaction of propane with Mo2C/SiO2 catalyst was
followed by means of IR spectroscopy. In the first experi-
ments the following approach was used: 1.0 Torr of propane
was introduced into the cell at 153 K and the IR spectra
were registered as a function of temperature. Bands ob-
served are the characteristic vibration of weakly adsorbed
propane. All the bands disappeared at 273 K without any
sign of the appearance of new spectral features. In the sub-
sequent experiments the Mo2C/SiO2 catalyst was contacted
with 10 Torr of propane at and above 300 K. The dominant
absorption bands at 300 K were the same as those regis-
tered at low temperatures. New bands at 2925, 1606, 1453,
(1434), 1411, and 1374 cm1 appeared after treatment of the
sample with propane at 573 K. After evacuation at 300 K
some bands were still detectable at 2925, 1453, 1411, and
1374 cm1. To increase the surface concentration of ad-
sorbed species the catalyst was kept in a flow of propane
at 373 K for 10 min. Afterwards, the cell was evacuated at
300 K, and IR spectra were measured. Weak absorption
bands remained at 1407 and 1367 cm1, which were elimi-
nated after heating of the sample to 423 K. Selected spectra
are presented in Fig. 1A, and the positions of absorption
bands are collected in Table 1.
In order to help in the assignment of the above absorp-
tion bands, in the subsequent measurements propylene was
adsorbed on the catalyst sample. IR spectra obtained for
Mo2C/SiO2 are displayed in Fig. 1B. We obtained relatively
strong vibrations at 2956, 2924, 2894, and 2857 cm1 in the
high-frequency region, and somewhat weaker ones at 1637,
1613 (not shown), 1453, 1438, 1412, and 1374 cm1 in the
low-frequency region. On heating of the catalyst in the pres-
ence of propylene new bands, indicating the occurrence of
a reaction in the adsorbed layer, developed at 1390 and
1469 cm1 These features were detected first at 253273 K.
Their intensities were enhanced with further increases in
the temperature. After evacuation of the cell at 300 K, spec-
tral features were registered at 2983, 2941, 2928, 1470, 1424,
1390, and 1377 cm1. All these vibrations were eliminated
by evacuation at and above 373 K. Note that in the case
of pure silica no absorption band could be detected at and
above 253 K, and there were no signs of the presence of
the 1390 and 1469 cm1 spectral features at all. Absorp-
tion bands observed and their assignments are also listed in
Table 1.
The interaction of propane with the catalysts was also
examined by means of TPD. The catalyst was kept in the
propane gas flow for 10 min for 373 K, and then it was
washed with pure argon for 30 min. Some TPD spectra
are presented in Fig. 2. TPD measurements clearly showed
that a small amount of propane remained adsorbed on the
pure ZSM-5 and was released at 430 K. In addition, the
formation of ethylene and propylene was observed with
Tp = 490 K. A high-temperature ethylene peak was also
observed at 770 K. In the case of Mo2C/ZSM-5 somewhat
larger amounts of gases desorbed and their peak tempera-
tures shifted to higher temperatures. The release of hydro-
gen and methane above 900 K was also observed. Similar
features were experienced for Mo2C/SiO2, but the amounts
of gases desorbed were much lower. A possible reason is
that no adsorption of propane occurs on the silica support.
3.2. Reactions of Propane on H-ZSM-5
First the catalytic behavior of the ZSM-5 support was
tested. It exhibited relatively high activity (50% conver-
sion) toward the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane

at 873 K. There was practically no decay in the conversion
and in the rate of formation of various products. The highest
selectivity, 32%, was measured for ethylene. This was fol-
lowed by methane, S = 30%. Propylene was produced with
a selectivity of 12%, whereas that of benzene was only 10%.
Other minor products were ethane, butane, and toluene. At
a higher temperature, 973 K, the conversion exceeded 90%,
and the selectivity of aromatics attained a value of 3335%.
On lowering the temperature the conversion of propane de-

creased and approached nearly zero value at around 770 K.
At the same time the selectivity to ethylene increased while
that for benzene drastically decreased. No change was ob-
served in the selectivity of methane formation. The catalytic
effect of silica was also tested. It exhibited very low reac-
tivity; the conversion of propane at 873 K was around 2.5%
yielding ethylene, methane, and ethane. The effects of tem-
perature on the rate of formation and selectivity of various
products are presented in Fig. 3.

sample was used at every temperature. Measurements were started at the highest temperature.
3.3. Reactions of Propane on Mo2C
In the next experimental series the reaction of propane
was investigated on unsupported Mo2C. The initial conver-
sion at 873 K was 24%, which diminished to a constant
value, 7.4%, in 15 min. Besides H2, ethylene (S = 33.0%),
methane (S 21%), and propylene (S = 44%) were found,
but benzene was not identified. The variation of the temper-
ature caused only slight changes in the product distribution
(Fig. 4A).
Some measurements were also performed with propy-
lene. The initial conversion was 3.8% at 873 K, which decay-
ed to a constant value (1.0%) in 15 min. The main prod-
ucts are butane, hexane, propane, ethylene, and methane
in commensurate amounts. Benzene and toluene were pro-
duced in trace amounts (S 12%). Lowering the temper-
ature resulted in a decrease in the selectivity of butane,
methane, and ethylene, and an increase in that of propane
and hexane (Fig. 4B).
3.4. Reactions of Propane on Supported Mo2C
A completely different picture was obtained for Mo2C/
ZSM-5. Results are presented in Fig. 5. The reaction of
propane was observed at 773 K. The initial conversion at
773 K was about 2.0%, which increased to 45.0% at 873 K.
Whereas there was only a slight decay in the activity of the
catalyst at 773 K, at higher temperatures the attainment of
a steady state required 5060 min. During the conditioning
period a slight enhancement occurred in the rate of forma-
tion of propylene and benzene. The products were practi-
cally the same as those measured for Mo2C-free ZSM-5,
but the product distribution was drastically different. The
main compound formed was benzene followed by methane
and ethylene. Other products were toluene, propylene, and
butane. An increase in the temperature was favorable for
the formation of benzene and toluene, and was disadvan-
tageous for that of ethylene and propylene. At 873 K, the
selectivity to benzene reached a value of 34%.
The effect of contact time on the reaction of propane was
determined by varying the flow rate of the reacting gas mix-
ture. Results for Mo2C/ZSM-5 are plotted in Fig. 6A. We
determined that with the increase of the flow rate the con-
version and the selectivity to aromatics decreased while the
selectivity to ethylene and propylene increased. No change
occurred in the selectivity to methane.
Similar measurements have been performed on Mo2C/
SiO2 catalyst. The product distribution basically differed
from that observed for Mo2C/ZSM-5. The initial main
products were methane and ethane. These were followed
by propylene, ethylene, benzene, toluene, and butane. A

gradual decay in the conversion and in the rate of all prod-
uct formation occurred. An exception was propylene; its
formation increased with time on stream. After the initial
stage, 20 min, it became the dominant product, and its se-
lectivity reached values of 3550% at 873 K (Fig. 7A). The
selectivities of all other products were below 15%. Interest-
ingly, the initial high selectivity to benzene, 23%, gradually
diminished to 13% after 120 min. When the temperature
was lowered after 2 h of reaction at 873 K, we obtained a sig-
nificant enhancement in the selectivity to propene (Fig. 7B).
The same features were observed when the measurements
were started at lower temperatures. The effect of contact
time was examined at 873 K. We determined that the con-
version drastically decreased at high flow rate, and at the
same time the selectivity to propylene increased (Fig. 6B).
For instance, at a flow rate of 50 ml/min, the selectivity to
propylene attained a value of 75% at a propane conversion
of 5%.
Some important data for the transformation of propane
on different catalysts are collected in Table 2.
3.5. Examination of Used Catalyst
In the infrared spectra of the Mo2C/ZSM-5 at 873 K for
120 min we detected several absorption bands, which in-
dicated the presence of strongly adsorbed CxHy species.
Treating this catalyst with hydrogen at 873 K, we observed
the formation of methane with small amounts of ethane and
ethylene at the beginning of the hydrogenation. The pro-
duction of methane decayed to a very low level only after
100120 min, but did not cease completely. This treatment
only slightly improved the catalytic performance. When hy-
drogenation of the catalyst was performed at 973 K, the ini-
tial high activity was somewhat restored but a subsequent
deactivation occurred again. The amount of carbonaceous
species measured at 873 K was 4.4 mmol/g catalyst. This
value was 6.8 mmol/g at 973 K.

3.6. Reactions of Propylene on ZSM-5 and Mo2C/ZSM-5
As in the aromatization of lower alkanes the oligomer-
ization of alkenes on the acidic sites of ZSM-5 plays an im-
portant role, it seemed necessary to examine the influence
of Mo2C on the reaction of propylene on ZSM-5. Under the
reaction conditions used 80% of propylene reacted on pure
ZSM-5 at 873 K, producing all the products measured in
the reaction of propane. The selectivity to benzene and
toluene was 27 and 24%, respectively. The other main prod-
uct was ethylene with 25% selectivity (Fig. 8A). The main
effect of Mo2C over ZSM-5 is that the formation of ethylene
was reduced, and at the same time the selectivity to benzene
and toluene was somewhat increased (Fig. 8B). The con-
version of propylene remained at a high level, above 80%.
Note that on unsupported Mo2C the cracking of propylene
was the main reaction route, and aromatics were only very
minor products (Fig. 4B).
4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Interaction and Reactions of Hydrocarbons
with Supported Mo2C
There are very few studies dealing with the interaction
of alkanes with Mo2C catalyst. Methane adsorbs weakly
and nondissociatively on supported and unsupported Mo2C
samples(4,5).Thedecompositionofmethanewasobserved
only above 900 K producing several hydrocarbon species,
ethane, ethylene, propane, and the deposition of carbo-
naceous species (5). Above 873 K, the aromatization of
methane proceeded on both silica- and ZSM-5-supported
Mo2C catalysts (310). The highest selectivity, 8085%,
was measured for Mo2C/ZSM-5 (5, 6). Ethane was more
reactive than methane. By means of FTIR spectroscopy,
spectroscopic evidence was obtained for the formation
of adsorbed ethylene at 270300 K, which transformed
into ethylidyne at higher temperature (26). The aromati-
zation of ethane occurred on Mo2C/ZSM-5 above 773 K
(11). A deeper insight into the role of Mo2C in the con-
version of the above hydrocarbons was provided by the
surface science studies of the reactions of different hydro-
carbon species, CH2, CH3, and C2H5, on Mo2C produced
on an Mo(111) single crystal surface (14, 15). We found
no report in the literature concerning the interaction and
reaction of propane on unsupported and supported Mo2C.
4.2. Interaction of Propane with Supported Mo2C
As shown in Table 1 the absorption bands observed fol-
lowing the adsorption of propane on Mo2C/SiO2 at 150
250 K correspond very well with the different vibrations of
324

adsorbed propane. At higher temperatures, however, new
spectral features appeared at 2925, 1453, 1429, 1411, and
1374 cm1, which suggests that a fraction of propane inter-
acted strongly with Mo2C. As the possible process was the
dehydrogenation of propane, the interaction of propylene
with supported Mo2C was also investigated. The character-
istic absorption bands of π-bonded and di-σ-bonded propy-
lene can be clearly established in the IR spectra (Fig. 1B).
In addition, the appearance of bands at 2983, 2941, 1470,
and 1390 cm1 suggests that adsorbed propylene is con-
verted into propylidyne at 273 K. Taking into account the
spectral features of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne
on Mo2C/SiO2, the absorption bands at 2925, 1453, 1411,
1374 cm1 found following the adsorption of propane at
573 K can be attributed to adsorbed propylene. We cannot
excludethatthevibrationofpropylidynealsocontributesto
these absorption bands. We assume that the two weak fea-
tures remaining on spectrum (e) in Fig. 1A are definitely
due to the strongly adsorbed propylidyne. The character-
istic absorption bands of propylidyne are as follows: 2960,
2920, 2870, 1450, 1410, and 1365 cm1 (2731). These spec-
tral features were also established following the adsorp-
tion of propane on Pt/SiO2 by Sheppard et al. (2731). Ac-
cordingly, the reactivity of highly dispersed Mo2C toward
propane and propylene is not much less than that of sup-
ported Pt catalyst.
The failure to prepare a stable, self-supporting disc from
ZSM-5-containing catalyst prevented us from performing
similar IR spectroscopic measurements. We could only es-
tablish that the adsorption of propane at 173273 K re-
sulted in the same absorption bands on both ZSM-5 and
Mo2C/ZSM-5 as on Mo2C/SiO2, and the propane bonded
more strongly compared to that on Mo2C/SiO2.
The presence of strongly adsorbed species remaining on
supported Mo2C after contact with propane is also sug-
gestedbyTPDmeasurements.Thisspeciesisconvertedinto
propylene and ethylene at higher temperatures (Fig. 2).

The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K is
the dehydrogenation process to give propylene with 44%
selectivity. The cracking of propylene also occurred, and
the main products were ethylene and methane. As the sur-
face area of Mo2C is low (810 m2/g), the conversion of
propane was only 7.4%.
Deposition of Mo2C on silica in a highly dispersed state
produced a much more effective catalyst. The initial prod-
ucts determined at 873 K suggest that the main reaction in
the first stage is the decomposition of propane into methane
and ethylene,
C3H8 CH4 + C2H4,

A fraction of C2H4 is hydrogenated into ethane. After the
initial stage the dehydrogenation of propane became the
dominant reaction pathway; propylene was produced with a
maximum 50% selectivity at 873 K (Fig. 7A). At lower tem-
peratures much higher selectivities, 8575%, were reached.
The change in the selectivities of product formation with
time on stream suggests that the deactivation of the cata-
lyst, very likely due to the deposition of carbon, is disad-
vantageous for the cracking of propane.
4.4. Reactions of Propane on ZSM-5 and on Mo2C/ZSM-5
A completely different picture was obtained on Mo2C/
ZSM-5 catalysts. The formation of aromatics came into
prominence, which was negligible on silica-supported
Mo2C. The aromatization of propane proceeds readily on
undoped ZSM-5 alone at and above 823 K; the preparation,
the composition of the ZSM-5, and the experimental condi-
tions all influence the conversion and product distribution
(1620). On our ZSM-5 sample, the reaction of propane was
measurable at 773 K (Fig. 3). The main products were ethy-
lene, methane, and propylene, suggesting the occurrence of
the reactions observed for Mo2C/SiO2. The selectivity of the
aromatics (benzene and toluene) at 873 K was around 16
18%, which increased to 34% at 973 K. When Mo2C was
deposited over ZSM-5, the catalytic performance of ZSM-5
markedly changed. The conversion of propane slightly de-
cayed, but the selectivity to benzene and toluene signifi-
cantly increased (Table 2).
In the description of the aromatization of propane on
ZSM-5 it is assumed that propane is activated through the
abstraction of hydride ions by carbonium ion (20). The
dimethyl carbonium ions formed may give propylene or re-
act with alkenes. Parallel with this reaction route the crack-
ing of alkenes (ethylene and propylene) also proceeds to
yield lower alkanes. The oligomerization of propylene on
the acidic sites in the zeolite cavities leads to the formation
of aromatics (20).
The favorable effect of Mo2C can be explained by its high
activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane. The re-
sults obtained for Mo2C/SiO2 clearly showed that Mo2C is
an effective catalyst to produce propylene from propane.
It remained, however, an open question as to how the
highlydispersedMo2Caffectstheoligomerizingpropertyof
ZSM-5. In the case of ethylene we found that Mo2C only
slightly influenced the conversion of ethylene, but lowered
by about 1015% the selectivity to aromatics. In the present
case, no unfavorable effect of Mo2C on the aromatization
capability of ZSM-5 was experienced; moreover, a slight in-
crease in the selectivities of the formation of both benzene
and toluene occurred (Fig. 8).
REACTIONS OF PROPANE ON SUPPORTED Mo2C CATALYSTS
325
CONCLUSIONS
(i) Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on sup-
ported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred
above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and
propylidyne were observed. (ii) Mo2C dispersed on silica is
an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the high-
est selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at
873 K. (iii) The reaction pathway of propane is completely
different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant re-
action is the aromatization of propane. The change in the
reaction route is attributed to the capability of ZSM-5 to
aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C.
