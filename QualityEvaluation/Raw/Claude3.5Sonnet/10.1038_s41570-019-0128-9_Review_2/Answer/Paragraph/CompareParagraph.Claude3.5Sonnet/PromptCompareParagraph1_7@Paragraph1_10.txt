The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques have provided crucial insights into their structural, chemical, and morphological properties at atomic and nanoscale levels. These techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural Properties:
In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments reveal the structural information of both catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. The XRD patterns also demonstrate the reversible structural evolution of the catalysts under different gas environments and temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

2. Oxidation States:
In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy determines the valence states of Ni and Fe. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0, while Fe sites exhibit features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2]. XANES spectra at the Fe K-edge indicate that Fe is present as a mixture of Fe0 and Fe2+ species in both catalysts, with a higher proportion of Fe0 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

3. Local Coordination and Particle Size:
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results provide information on the coordination numbers and bond lengths, indicating the formation of NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm on both catalysts [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. EXAFS analysis at the Fe K-edge shows that Fe-Fe coordination numbers are higher in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting larger Fe-rich particles [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. Spatial Distribution and Morphology:
Ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of different elements [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. Annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with EELS mapping demonstrates the spatial distribution and morphology of metal nanoparticles on the ceria support [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2].

Key differences and implications:

1. A 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer is clearly observed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2, while such a layer is absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. This difference leads to the formation of different interfacial sites, with NiFeOx interfacial sites in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and NiCeOx interfacial sites in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.

2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has a higher proportion of Fe0 and larger Fe-rich particles compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which could affect catalytic activity and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

3. The spatial distribution and morphology of Fe and Ni species on the CeO2 support differ between the two catalysts, potentially influencing their performance [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. In situ XANES measurements during CO2 hydrogenation reveal dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state, with partial oxidation occurring under reaction conditions [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design. The ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different interfacial sites, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. The detailed understanding of the catalyst structures and active sites allows for more targeted catalyst design and optimization for specific reactions, such as CO2-ODH or dry reforming of C2H6 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive characterization of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques has provided a deep understanding of their structural, chemical, and morphological properties. This knowledge opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization in the field of propane dehydrogenation and related reactions.

Future research directions may include:

1. Exploring a wider range of Fe:Ni ratios to fine-tune the balance between dehydrogenation and reforming activities.

2. Investigating the effect of different support materials on the formation and stability of FeOx layers and their impact on catalytic performance.

3. Developing in operando characterization techniques to monitor the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation states under realistic reaction conditions.

4. Utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures based on the wealth of data generated by these advanced analytical techniques.

5. Exploring the potential of these bimetallic catalysts in other industrially relevant reactions, such as CO2 utilization or biomass conversion.

By continuing to leverage these advanced characterization techniques and expanding our understanding of structure-function relationships, we can pave the way for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for sustainable chemical production.

The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts represent a crucial step in understanding their catalytic performance and potential applications. By employing a combination of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, researchers can delve into the intricacies of these catalysts at atomic and nanoscale levels. These methods allow for the elucidation of structural, chemical, and morphological properties, providing valuable insights into the nature of the active sites and their interactions with the support material. Techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy can reveal the oxidation states, local atomic arrangements, and surface composition of the catalysts. Additionally, in situ studies using environmental TEM or operando spectroscopy can capture dynamic changes in the catalysts under reaction conditions. By comparing the results obtained for Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2, researchers can identify key differences in active site properties that may explain variations in catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability between these two systems.
