The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques have provided valuable insights into their structural, chemical, and morphological properties at atomic and nanoscale levels. These findings are crucial for understanding the catalytic performance and designing improved catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments revealed the structural evolution of both catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. The reversible structural changes observed under different gas environments and temperatures highlight the dynamic nature of these catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy provided crucial information on the oxidation states of Ni and Fe in both catalysts. Ni was found to exist in the metallic state (Ni0) in both catalysts, while Fe exhibited features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2]. Interestingly, Fe was present as a mixture of Fe0 and Fe2+ species in both catalysts, with a higher proportion of Fe0 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis provided detailed information on the local coordination environments of Fe and Ni species. The fitting results revealed that metallic NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm were present in both catalysts [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. Furthermore, EXAFS analysis at the Fe K-edge showed higher Fe-Fe coordination numbers in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting the presence of larger Fe-rich particles [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

The spatial distribution and morphology of the active sites were elucidated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). This combination of techniques confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, while such layers were absent in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. High-resolution micrographs further revealed that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 were in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which was not observed in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2].

The key differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts and their implications for catalyst performance and design are:

1. The presence of a 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer on CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which are likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].

2. The absence of the FeOx layer in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 results in the dominance of NiCeOx interfacial sites, which are likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].

3. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 had a higher proportion of Fe0 and larger Fe-rich particles compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2, potentially affecting catalytic activity and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. The spatial distribution and morphology of Fe and Ni species on the CeO2 support differed between the two catalysts, influencing their performance [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

These findings demonstrate that the ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different interfacial sites, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive characterization of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced analytical techniques has provided valuable insights into the structure-function relationships of these materials. This knowledge opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization in the field of propane dehydrogenation and related reactions.

Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Developing in operando characterization techniques that combine multiple spectroscopic and microscopic methods to provide real-time information on catalyst structure and performance under reaction conditions.

2. Exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures based on the wealth of data generated by these advanced characterization techniques.

3. Investigating the potential of novel synthesis methods, such as atomic layer deposition or controlled precipitation techniques, to fine-tune the spatial distribution and morphology of active sites in bimetallic catalysts.

4. Extending the study to other bimetallic combinations and support materials to develop a broader understanding of the factors influencing catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation and related reactions.

5. Developing strategies to enhance the stability of the active FeOx layers and prevent sintering of metal nanoparticles during long-term operation, thereby improving catalyst longevity and performance.

These future directions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and related reactions, contributing to the advancement of sustainable chemical processes and energy technologies.

The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques have provided crucial insights into their structural, chemical, and morphological properties at atomic and nanoscale levels. These techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural Properties: In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments reveal the structural information of both catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. The XRD patterns also demonstrate the reversible structural evolution of the catalysts under different gas environments and temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

2. Oxidation States: In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy determines the valence states of Ni and Fe. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0, while Fe sites exhibit features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2]. XANES spectra at the Fe K-edge indicate that Fe is present as a mixture of Fe0 and Fe2+ species in both catalysts, with a higher proportion of Fe0 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

3. Local Coordination and Particle Size: Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results provide information on coordination numbers and bond lengths. The analysis reveals that metallic NiFe alloy particles have diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm in both catalysts [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. EXAFS analysis at the Fe K-edge shows higher Fe-Fe coordination numbers in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting larger Fe-rich particles [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. Spatial Distribution and Morphology: Ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of different elements [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. This technique reveals distinct differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2, with the former showing CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which is absent in the latter [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2].

5. Dynamic Behavior: In situ XANES measurements during CO2 hydrogenation show dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state, with partial oxidation occurring under reaction conditions [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

Key differences and implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of a 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer on CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, which is absent in Fe1Ni3/CeO2, leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites. These sites are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective C-H bond cleavage to produce ethylene) [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].

2. The absence of the FeOx layer in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 results in the dominance of NiCeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient C-C bond scission to produce synthesis gas) [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].

3. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has a higher proportion of Fe0 and larger Fe-rich particles compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which could affect catalytic activity and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. The differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 suggest that the Fe:Ni ratio affects the overall catalyst structure, which may lead to different catalytic behaviors [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2].

5. The nanoscale dimensions of the metallic particles (2.5-4.0 nm) highlight the importance of controlling particle size for optimal catalyst performance [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_2].

These findings demonstrate that the ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different interfacial sites, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions. This comprehensive understanding of the catalysts' characteristics allows for more targeted and effective catalyst design strategies for specific applications.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advanced characterization techniques employed in this study have provided unprecedented insights into the structure-function relationships of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. Moving forward, these findings open up several avenues for future research and catalyst design:

1. Tailored Interfacial Sites: The discovery of the crucial role played by NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfacial sites suggests that future catalyst designs could focus on precisely engineering these interfaces. This could involve developing methods to control the formation and distribution of FeOx layers on CeO2 supports or exploring other metal oxide combinations to create novel interfacial sites with desired properties.

2. In Operando Studies: The observed dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state during reaction conditions highlight the importance of in operando studies. Future research could focus on developing more advanced in situ and operando characterization techniques to capture the real-time evolution of catalyst structures and active sites under realistic reaction conditions.

3. Rational Catalyst Design: The comprehensive understanding gained from this study can guide the development of predictive models for catalyst performance based on composition and structure. This could lead to more efficient screening of potential catalyst compositions and accelerate the discovery of high-performance catalysts for specific reactions.

4. Multifunctional Catalysts: The ability to tune catalyst selectivity by controlling the Ni:Fe ratio opens up possibilities for designing multifunctional catalysts that can perform sequential or tandem reactions. This could lead to more efficient and integrated catalytic processes in various applications, such as CO2 utilization and hydrocarbon upgrading.

5. Nanoscale Engineering: The importance of particle size and morphology in determining catalyst performance suggests that future research could focus on developing precise nanostructure control methods. This could involve exploring novel synthesis techniques or employing advanced templating methods to create catalysts with optimized nanostructures for specific reactions.

By pursuing these research directions, we can expect significant advancements in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, leading to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes in the future.
