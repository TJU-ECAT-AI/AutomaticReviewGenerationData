The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. In situ XRD provides structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure on both catalysts.

2. In situ XANES spectroscopy determines the valence states of Ni and Fe, showing that Ni is in metallic state while Fe is in an oxidized state between FeO and Fe3O4 on both catalysts.

3. EXAFS fitting results provide information on the coordination numbers and bond lengths, indicating the formation of NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm on both catalysts.

4. Ex situ STEM-EELS analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of different elements.

Key differences and implications:

1. A 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer is clearly observed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2, while such a layer is absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.

2. The presence of the FeOx layer in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene).

3. The absence of the FeOx layer in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 results in the dominance of NiCeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas).

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design, as they demonstrate that the ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different interfacial sites, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions.

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural properties: In situ synchrotron XRD provides information on the overall structural properties of both catalysts.

2. Oxidation states: In situ XANES reveals the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. Ni exists as Ni0 in both catalysts, while Fe sites have features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4.

3. Particle size and composition: EXAFS fitting results indicate that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys form particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

4. Spatial distribution and morphology: The combination of ADF-STEM and EELS confirms the existence of thin layers of oxidized Fe species on CeO2. This is supported by the observation of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites.

5. Catalyst-specific differences: High-resolution micrographs reveal differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2. The former shows CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which is not observed in the latter.

Key differences and implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of metallic Ni and partially oxidized Fe species suggests that both elements play crucial roles in the catalytic process.

2. The formation of thin FeOx layers on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 indicates the creation of unique interfacial sites that may contribute to its catalytic activity, particularly for CO2-ODH of C2H6.

3. The differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 suggest that the Fe:Ni ratio affects the overall catalyst structure, which may lead to different catalytic behaviors.

4. The nanoscale dimensions of the metallic particles (2.5-4.0 nm) highlight the importance of controlling particle size for optimal catalyst performance.

5. The detailed understanding of the catalyst structures and active sites allows for more targeted catalyst design and optimization for specific reactions, such as CO2-ODH or dry reforming of C2H6.

These findings collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships in these catalysts, enabling more targeted and effective catalyst design strategies for specific applications.

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. XRD provides information on the reversible structural evolution of the catalysts under different gas environments and temperatures, as well as identifying crystalline phases in fresh catalysts.

2. XANES and EXAFS analyses offer insights into the oxidation states and local coordination environments of Fe and Ni species during redox treatments. XANES revealed a mixture of Fe0 and Fe2+ species in both catalysts, with a higher proportion of Fe0 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2. EXAFS analysis showed higher Fe-Fe coordination numbers in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting larger Fe-rich particles.

3. ADF-STEM imaging coupled with EELS mapping demonstrates the spatial distribution and morphology of metal nanoparticles on the ceria support.

4. In situ XANES measurements during CO2 hydrogenation revealed dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state under reaction conditions, showing partial oxidation.

Key differences and implications:

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 had a higher proportion of Fe0 and larger Fe-rich particles compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which could affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The spatial distribution and morphology of Fe and Ni species on the CeO2 support differed between the two catalysts, potentially influencing their performance.

3. The observed dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state during reaction conditions highlight the importance of in situ studies for understanding catalyst behavior under operating conditions.

These findings have implications for catalyst design, emphasizing the need to consider both composition and structure in optimizing catalyst performance. The combination of techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalysts' characteristics, allowing researchers to make informed decisions in improving catalyst performance and designing new catalytic systems.
