          [1] "The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."

[2] "In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b)."

[3] "Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."

[4] "The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."

[5] "The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

          The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural properties: In situ synchrotron XRD provides information on the overall structural properties of both catalysts.

2. Oxidation states: In situ XANES reveals the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. Ni exists as Ni0 in both catalysts, while Fe sites have features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4.

3. Particle size and composition: EXAFS fitting results indicate that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys form particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

4. Spatial distribution and morphology: The combination of ADF-STEM and EELS confirms the existence of thin layers of oxidized Fe species on CeO2. This is supported by the observation of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites.

5. Catalyst-specific differences: High-resolution micrographs reveal differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2. The former shows CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which is not observed in the latter.

Key differences and implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of metallic Ni and partially oxidized Fe species suggests that both elements play crucial roles in the catalytic process.

2. The formation of thin FeOx layers on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 indicates the creation of unique interfacial sites that may contribute to its catalytic activity, particularly for CO2-ODH of C2H6.

3. The differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 suggest that the Fe:Ni ratio affects the overall catalyst structure, which may lead to different catalytic behaviors.

4. The nanoscale dimensions of the metallic particles (2.5-4.0 nm) highlight the importance of controlling particle size for optimal catalyst performance.

5. The detailed understanding of the catalyst structures and active sites allows for more targeted catalyst design and optimization for specific reactions, such as CO2-ODH or dry reforming of C2H6.

These findings collectively contribute to a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships in these catalysts, enabling more targeted and effective catalyst design strategies for specific applications.

          先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂的理解，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 结构特性：原位同步辐射XRD提供了两种催化剂的整体结构特性信息。

2. 氧化态：原位XANES揭示了Ni和Fe的氧化态。在两种催化剂中，Ni以Ni0形式存在，而Fe位点显示出介于FeO和Fe3O4之间的特征，更接近Fe3O4。

3. 粒子尺寸和成分：EXAFS拟合结果表明，金属Ni或FeNi合金形成直径为2.5-4.0 nm的粒子。

4. 空间分布和形态：ADF-STEM和EELS的组合证实了氧化Fe物种在CeO2上以薄层形式存在。这一点得到了FeCe键合的观察和Fe位点周围O原子配位数较低的支持。

5. 催化剂特定差异：高分辨率显微图像揭示了Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2之间的差异。前者显示CeO2与薄层FeOx接触，而后者没有观察到这种现象。

对催化剂性能和设计的主要差异和影响：

1. 金属Ni和部分氧化Fe物种的存在表明两种元素在催化过程中都起着关键作用。

2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2中在CeO2上形成薄层FeOx表明创建了独特的界面位点，可能有助于其催化活性，特别是对C2H6的CO2-ODH反应。

3. Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2之间CeO2粒子形态的差异表明Fe:Ni比例影响整体催化剂结构，可能导致不同的催化行为。

4. 金属粒子的纳米尺度（2.5-4.0 nm）突出了控制粒子尺寸对优化催化剂性能的重要性。

5. 对催化剂结构和活性位点的详细了解允许针对特定反应（如C2H6的CO2-ODH或干重整）进行更有针对性的催化剂设计和优化。

这些发现共同促进了对这些催化剂结构-功能关系的深入理解，使我们能够为特定应用设计更有针对性和更有效的催化剂策略。
