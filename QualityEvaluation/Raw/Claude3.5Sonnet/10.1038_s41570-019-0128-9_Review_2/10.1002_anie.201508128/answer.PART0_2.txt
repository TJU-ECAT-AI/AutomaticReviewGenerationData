[1] "To help identify reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare differences in binding energies of potential reaction intermediates."

[2] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were used to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions."

[3] "By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis. Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree."

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the synergistic use of XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS techniques. However, the study does demonstrate the use of advanced analytical techniques, particularly DFT calculations and XANES, to understand catalyst properties and performance.

DFT calculations were used to compare binding energies of reaction intermediates on different catalyst surfaces, providing insights into reaction pathways and catalyst selectivity. XANES measurements were employed to determine the oxidation state of Mo2C under various reaction conditions, revealing how the catalyst's structure changes during reduction and reaction processes.

These techniques allowed researchers to understand the structural properties, oxidation states, and reaction mechanisms of the catalysts studied. While the specific catalysts mentioned in the question are not discussed, the approach demonstrates how combining computational and experimental techniques can provide valuable insights for catalyst design and optimization.
