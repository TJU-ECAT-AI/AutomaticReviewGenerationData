The literature does not provide specific information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the use of XRD, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS techniques. However, it does discuss the use of XANES to study Mo2C catalysts.

XANES was used to investigate the oxidation state of Mo2C under various reaction conditions. The technique revealed clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during different gas treatments, except when exposed to pure ethane. To quantify these changes, the Mo spectra were fitted using a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards.

While this information doesn't directly address the specific catalysts mentioned in the question, it demonstrates how in situ XANES can be used to understand the structural properties and oxidation states of catalysts under reaction conditions. This type of analysis can provide valuable insights into catalyst behavior and performance, which can inform future catalyst design and optimization.

虽然这些信息并不直接涉及问题中提到的特定催化剂，但它展示了原位XANES如何被用来理解催化剂在反应条件下的结构特性和氧化态。这种分析可以为催化剂行为和性能提供有价值的见解，从而为未来的催化剂设计和优化提供信息。

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the synergistic use of XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS for their analysis. However, the document does mention the use of DFT calculations and XANES spectroscopy to study catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms for other catalysts (Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based).

DFT calculations were used to compare binding energies of potential reaction intermediates on different catalyst surfaces, helping to identify reaction pathways. XANES measurements were employed to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under various reaction conditions. The XANES spectra were analyzed using linear combination fitting of standard spectra to quantify changes in the oxidation state of Mo during different gas treatments.

While these techniques provide valuable insights into catalyst structure, oxidation states, and reaction mechanisms, the specific synergistic use of multiple advanced techniques for Fe-Ni catalysts is not discussed in the given literature.

[1] "To verify the DFT predictions, reactions of ethane and CO2 were evaluated in a quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure."

[2] "To further understand the mechanism of deactivation over Mo2C, insitu XANES measurements were performed over pure Mo2C."

[3] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements of Mo2C in different gas environments, with a)raw spectra and b)ΔXANES subtracted from the reduced sample. All spectra measured at room temperature after treatment at 450C for reduction and 600C for CO2 and ethane environments."

[4] "By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the full range of analytical techniques mentioned in the question. However, it does discuss the use of in situ XANES to study Mo2C catalysts.

XANES was used to investigate the oxidation state changes of Mo2C under different reaction conditions. This technique provided insights into:

1. The effect of H2 treatment on removing oxide species formed during catalyst synthesis.
2. The oxidation of Mo2C during reaction with ethane and CO2.
3. The complete oxidation of Mo2C when exposed to pure CO2.

These findings help explain the deactivation mechanism of Mo2C catalysts and the role of oxygen species in the reaction. While the study doesn't cover all the techniques or catalysts mentioned in the question, it demonstrates how in situ spectroscopic techniques can provide valuable information about catalyst structure and oxidation state under reaction conditions, which is crucial for understanding catalyst performance and designing improved catalysts.
