[1] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were used to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions."

[2] "XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane."

[3] "To quantify these changes, each Mo spectrum was fitted by a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards, as described previously."

The document does not provide specific information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the use of XRD, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS techniques. However, it does discuss the use of XANES for analyzing Mo2C catalysts.

XANES was used to study the oxidation state of Mo2C under different reaction conditions. The technique revealed changes in the Mo oxidation state during various gas treatments, except when exposed to pure ethane. Quantitative analysis was performed by fitting each Mo spectrum using a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards.

This application of XANES demonstrates its utility in understanding structural properties and oxidation states of catalysts under reaction conditions. While the specific catalysts mentioned in the question are not discussed, the use of XANES for Mo2C illustrates how this technique can provide valuable insights into catalyst behavior and active site characteristics during reactions.

该文档没有提供关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂或使用XRD、EXAFS和ADF-STEM配合EELS技术的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了使用XANES分析Mo2C催化剂。

XANES被用于研究Mo2C在不同反应条件下的氧化态。该技术揭示了在各种气体处理过程中Mo氧化态的变化，除了暴露在纯乙烷中时。定量分析是通过使用Mo2C、MoO3和MoO2标准的线性组合拟合每个Mo谱来进行的。

XANES的这种应用展示了它在理解反应条件下催化剂结构特性和氧化态方面的实用性。虽然问题中提到的特定催化剂没有被讨论，但XANES在Mo2C上的应用说明了这种技术如何能为催化剂行为和活性位点特征在反应过程中提供有价值的见解。
