[1] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were used to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions."

[2] "XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane."

[3] "To quantify these changes, each Mo spectrum was fitted by a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards, as described previously."

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the use of XRD, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS techniques. However, it does discuss the use of XANES to study Mo2C catalysts.

XANES was used to investigate the oxidation state of Mo2C under various reaction conditions. The technique revealed clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during different gas treatments, except when exposed to pure ethane. To quantify these changes, the Mo spectra were fitted using a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards.

While this information doesn't directly address the specific catalysts mentioned in the question, it demonstrates how in situ XANES can be used to understand the structural properties and oxidation states of catalysts under reaction conditions. This type of analysis can provide valuable insights into catalyst behavior and performance, which can inform future catalyst design and optimization.

该文献没有提供关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂或使用XRD、EXAFS和ADF-STEM与EELS技术的具体信息。然而，它确实讨论了使用XANES来研究Mo2C催化剂。

XANES被用来研究Mo2C在各种反应条件下的氧化态。该技术揭示了Mo在不同气体处理过程中氧化态的明显变化，除了暴露在纯乙烷中时。为了量化这些变化，Mo谱图被使用Mo2C、MoO3和MoO2标准的线性组合进行拟合。

虽然这些信息并不直接涉及问题中提到的特定催化剂，但它展示了原位XANES如何被用来理解催化剂在反应条件下的结构特性和氧化态。这种分析可以为催化剂行为和性能提供有价值的见解，从而为未来的催化剂设计和优化提供信息。
