[1] "To verify the DFT predictions, reactions of ethane and CO2 were evaluated in a quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure."

[2] "To further understand the mechanism of deactivation over Mo2C, insitu XANES measurements were performed over pure Mo2C."

[3] "X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements of Mo2C in different gas environments, with a)raw spectra and b)ΔXANES subtracted from the reduced sample. All spectra measured at room temperature after treatment at 450C for reduction and 600C for CO2 and ethane environments."

[4] "By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis. Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree. Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the full range of analytical techniques mentioned in the question. However, it does discuss the use of in situ XANES to study Mo2C catalysts.

XANES was used to investigate the oxidation state changes of Mo2C under different reaction conditions. This technique provided insights into:

1. The effect of H2 treatment on removing oxide species formed during catalyst synthesis.
2. The oxidation of Mo2C during reaction with ethane and CO2.
3. The complete oxidation of Mo2C when exposed to pure CO2.

These findings help explain the deactivation mechanism of Mo2C catalysts and the role of oxygen species in the reaction. While the study doesn't cover all the techniques or catalysts mentioned in the question, it demonstrates how in situ spectroscopic techniques can provide valuable information about catalyst structure and oxidation state under reaction conditions, which is crucial for understanding catalyst performance and designing improved catalysts.

文献没有提供关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂或问题中提到的全部分析技术的综合信息。但是，它确实讨论了使用原位XANES研究Mo2C催化剂。

XANES被用来研究Mo2C在不同反应条件下的氧化态变化。这种技术提供了以下见解：

1. H2处理对去除催化剂合成过程中形成的氧化物种的影响。
2. Mo2C在与乙烷和CO2反应过程中的氧化。
3. 暴露在纯CO2中时Mo2C的完全氧化。

这些发现有助于解释Mo2C催化剂的失活机制和氧物种在反应中的作用。虽然这项研究没有涵盖问题中提到的所有技术或催化剂，但它展示了原位光谱技术如何能够提供关于催化剂在反应条件下的结构和氧化态的宝贵信息，这对于理解催化剂性能和设计改进的催化剂至关重要。
