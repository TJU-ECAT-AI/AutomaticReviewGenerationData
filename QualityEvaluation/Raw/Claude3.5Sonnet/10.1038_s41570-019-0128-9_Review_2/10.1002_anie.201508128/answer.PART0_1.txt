[1] "To help identify reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare differences in binding energies of potential reaction intermediates."

[2] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements were used to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under reaction conditions."

[3] "The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane."

[4] "To quantify these changes, each Mo spectrum was fitted by a linear combination of Mo2C, MoO3, and MoO2 standards, as described previously."

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the synergistic use of XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS for their analysis. However, the document does mention the use of DFT calculations and XANES spectroscopy to study catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms for other catalysts (Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based).

DFT calculations were used to compare binding energies of potential reaction intermediates on different catalyst surfaces, helping to identify reaction pathways. XANES measurements were employed to confirm the oxidation state of Mo2C under various reaction conditions. The XANES spectra were analyzed using linear combination fitting of standard spectra to quantify changes in the oxidation state of Mo during different gas treatments.

While these techniques provide valuable insights into catalyst structure, oxidation states, and reaction mechanisms, the specific synergistic use of multiple advanced techniques for Fe-Ni catalysts is not discussed in the given literature.

文献中没有提供关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂的具体信息，也没有提到XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM与EELS协同使用来分析这些催化剂的情况。然而，文档确实提到了使用DFT计算和XANES光谱来研究其他催化剂（Pt/CeO2和基于Mo2C的催化剂）的性质和反应机理。

DFT计算被用来比较不同催化剂表面上潜在反应中间体的结合能，有助于识别反应途径。XANES测量被用来确认Mo2C在各种反应条件下的氧化态。XANES谱图通过标准谱图的线性组合拟合来分析，以量化Mo在不同气体处理过程中氧化态的变化。

虽然这些技术为催化剂结构、氧化态和反应机理提供了宝贵的见解，但给定的文献中并未讨论多种先进技术对Fe-Ni催化剂的具体协同使用。
