[1] "In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b)."

[2] "Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."

[3] "The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)"

[4] "The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques contribute synergistically to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. Oxidation states: XRD and XANES reveal that Ni exists as Ni0 in both catalysts, while Fe sites have oxidation states between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4.

2. Particle size and composition: EXAFS fitting shows that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys form particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

3. Spatial distribution: The combination of EXAFS, ADF-STEM, and EELS demonstrates that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, with FeCe bonding present.

4. Morphological characteristics: High-resolution micrographs from ADF-STEM reveal differences in CeO2 particle structure between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2. The former has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, confirmed by EELS line scan profiles.

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of metallic Ni and partially oxidized Fe species suggests different roles for each metal in the catalytic process.

2. The thin layers of FeOx on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 may create unique active sites at the interface, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

3. The differences in CeO2 particle structure between the two catalysts indicate that the Fe:Ni ratio affects the overall catalyst morphology, which could influence catalytic performance.

4. Understanding the spatial distribution and oxidation states of the metal species allows for more targeted catalyst design, optimizing the interface between active components for improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂的理解，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 氧化态：XRD和XANES显示，两种催化剂中的Ni都以Ni0形式存在，而Fe位点的氧化态介于FeO和Fe3O4之间，更接近Fe3O4。

2. 粒子大小和组成：EXAFS拟合表明，金属Ni或FeNi合金形成直径为2.5-4.0 nm的颗粒。

3. 空间分布：EXAFS、ADF-STEM和EELS的组合表明，氧化的Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上，并存在FeCe键合。

4. 形态特征：ADF-STEM的高分辨率显微图像揭示了Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2中CeO2颗粒结构的差异。前者的CeO2与一层薄的FeOx接触，这一点通过EELS线扫描剖面得到确认。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计有重要影响：

1. 金属Ni和部分氧化的Fe物种的存在表明每种金属在催化过程中扮演不同的角色。

2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2中CeO2上的FeOx薄层可能在界面处创造独特的活性位点，潜在地提高催化活性。

3. 两种催化剂中CeO2颗粒结构的差异表明，Fe:Ni比例影响整体催化剂形态，这可能影响催化性能。

4. 了解金属物种的空间分布和氧化态允许更有针对性的催化剂设计，优化活性组分之间的界面，以提高催化活性和选择性。
