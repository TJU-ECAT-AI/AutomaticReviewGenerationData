[1] "The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."

[2] "In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b)."

[3] "Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."

[4] "The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."

[5] "The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques contribute synergistically to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural properties: In situ synchrotron XRD provides information on the overall structural properties of both catalysts.

2. Oxidation states: In situ XANES data reveals the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. Ni exists as Ni0 in both catalysts, while Fe sites show features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4.

3. Particle size and composition: EXAFS fitting results indicate that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys form particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

4. Spatial distribution and morphology: The combination of ADF-STEM with EELS corroborates the existence of thin layers of oxidized Fe species on CeO2. This technique also reveals differences in CeO2 particles between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2.

5. Interfacial characteristics: EELS line scan profiles provide evidence of CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx in Fe3Ni1/CeO2.

Key differences and implications:

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 does not exhibit this feature.

2. The presence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites suggest that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2.

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The different structures of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 lead to different active sites and catalytic behaviors.

2. The presence of thin FeOx layers on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 may contribute to its high activity for CO2-ODH of C2H6.

3. The detailed understanding of the catalyst structures and active sites allows for more targeted catalyst design and optimization for specific reactions, such as CO2-ODH or dry reforming of C2H6.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术对我们理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂的协同贡献如下：

1. 结构特性：原位同步辐射XRD提供了两种催化剂的整体结构特性信息。

2. 氧化态：原位XANES数据揭示了Ni和Fe的氧化态。两种催化剂中Ni以Ni0存在，而Fe位点显示出介于FeO和Fe3O4之间的特征，更接近Fe3O4。

3. 粒径和成分：EXAFS拟合结果表明，金属Ni或FeNi合金形成直径为2.5-4.0 nm的颗粒。

4. 空间分布和形貌：ADF-STEM与EELS的结合证实了在CeO2上存在氧化Fe物种的薄层。该技术还揭示了Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2中CeO2颗粒的差异。

5. 界面特征：EELS线扫描剖面为Fe3Ni1/CeO2中CeO2与薄层FeOx接触提供了证据。

主要差异和意义：

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2显示CeO2与薄层FeOx接触，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2不展示此特征。

2. FeCe键合的存在和与Fe位点配位的O原子数量较少表明氧化Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计有重要意义：

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2的不同结构导致不同的活性位点和催化行为。

2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2中CeO2上薄FeOx层的存在可能有助于其对C2H6的CO2-ODH反应的高活性。

3. 对催化剂结构和活性位点的详细了解允许针对特定反应（如C2H6的CO2-ODH或干重整）进行更有针对性的催化剂设计和优化。
