[1] "The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."

[2] "In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b)."

[3] "Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."

[4] "The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."

[5] "The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural properties: In situ synchrotron XRD provides information on the overall structural properties of both catalysts.

2. Oxidation states: In situ XANES reveals the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. Ni exists as Ni0 in both catalysts, while Fe sites have features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4.

3. Particle size and composition: EXAFS fitting results indicate that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys form particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

4. Spatial distribution and morphology: The combination of EXAFS, ADF-STEM, and EELS shows that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2. This is supported by the observed FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites.

5. Catalyst-specific differences: High-resolution micrographs and EELS line scan profiles reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has CeO2 particles in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which differs from Fe1Ni3/CeO2.

These findings have important implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of Ni0 and partially oxidized Fe species suggests that both metals play crucial roles in the catalytic process, with Ni likely providing active sites for hydrocarbon activation and Fe contributing to CO2 activation.

2. The formation of thin FeOx layers on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 indicates the creation of unique interfacial sites that may enhance catalyst activity and selectivity.

3. The differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 suggest that the Fe:Ni ratio significantly influences the catalyst structure, which may lead to different catalytic behaviors.

4. The nanoscale particle sizes (2.5-4.0 nm) of metallic Ni or FeNi alloys imply a high surface area for catalytic reactions, potentially improving overall catalyst efficiency.

5. The detailed characterization of these catalysts provides valuable insights for designing and optimizing future catalysts with specific Fe:Ni ratios and controlled interactions with the CeO2 support to achieve desired catalytic performance.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂的理解，具体如下：

1. 结构特性：原位同步辐射XRD提供了两种催化剂的整体结构特性信息。

2. 氧化态：原位XANES揭示了Ni和Fe的氧化态。两种催化剂中Ni以Ni0形式存在，而Fe位点的特征介于FeO和Fe3O4之间，更接近Fe3O4。

3. 粒子尺寸和成分：EXAFS拟合结果表明，金属Ni或FeNi合金形成直径为2.5-4.0 nm的粒子。

4. 空间分布和形貌：EXAFS、ADF-STEM和EELS的组合显示，氧化的Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上。这一点得到了观察到的FeCe键合和与Fe位点配位的O原子数量较少的支持。

5. 催化剂特定差异：高分辨率显微图像和EELS线扫描剖面显示，Fe3Ni1/CeO2中的CeO2粒子与薄层FeOx接触，这与Fe1Ni3/CeO2不同。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计有重要意义：

1. Ni0和部分氧化Fe物种的存在表明两种金属在催化过程中发挥关键作用，Ni可能提供烃类活化的活性位点，而Fe有助于CO2活化。

2. Fe3Ni1/CeO2中在CeO2上形成薄层FeOx表明创造了独特的界面位点，可能增强催化剂的活性和选择性。

3. Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2之间CeO2粒子形貌的差异表明Fe:Ni比例显著影响催化剂结构，可能导致不同的催化行为。

4. 金属Ni或FeNi合金的纳米尺度粒子大小（2.5-4.0 nm）意味着催化反应具有高表面积，可能提高整体催化效率。

5. 对这些催化剂的详细表征为设计和优化未来催化剂提供了宝贵的见解，可以通过特定的Fe:Ni比例和控制与CeO2载体的相互作用来实现所需的催化性能。
