The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural properties: In situ synchrotron XRD provides information on the overall structural properties of both catalysts.

2. Oxidation states: In situ XANES reveals the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. Ni exists as Ni0 in both catalysts, while Fe sites have features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4.

3. Particle size and composition: EXAFS fitting results indicate that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys form particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

4. Spatial distribution and morphology: The combination of EXAFS, ADF-STEM, and EELS shows that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2. This is supported by the observed FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites.

5. Catalyst-specific differences: High-resolution micrographs and EELS line scan profiles reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has CeO2 particles in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which differs from Fe1Ni3/CeO2.

These findings have important implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of Ni0 and partially oxidized Fe species suggests that both metals play crucial roles in the catalytic process, with Ni likely providing active sites for hydrocarbon activation and Fe contributing to CO2 activation.

2. The formation of thin FeOx layers on CeO2 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 indicates the creation of unique interfacial sites that may enhance catalyst activity and selectivity.

3. The differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 suggest that the Fe:Ni ratio significantly influences the catalyst structure, which may lead to different catalytic behaviors.

4. The nanoscale particle sizes (2.5-4.0 nm) of metallic Ni or FeNi alloys imply a high surface area for catalytic reactions, potentially improving overall catalyst efficiency.

5. The detailed characterization of these catalysts provides valuable insights for designing and optimizing future catalysts with specific Fe:Ni ratios and controlled interactions with the CeO2 support to achieve desired catalytic performance.
