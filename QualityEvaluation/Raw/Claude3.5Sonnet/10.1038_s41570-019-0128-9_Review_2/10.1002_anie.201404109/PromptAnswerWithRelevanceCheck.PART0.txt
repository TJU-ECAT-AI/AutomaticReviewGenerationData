Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the specific analytical techniques mentioned in the question. The document primarily discusses molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and cobalt-modified Mo2C catalysts for CO2 conversion. It does not address the synergistic use of XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS for analyzing iron-nickel catalysts supported on ceria. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

The given literature does not contain information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts or the specific analytical techniques mentioned in the question. The document primarily focuses on molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and cobalt-modified Mo2C catalysts for CO2 conversion to CO. While it does mention some analytical techniques like XRD, XANES, and AP-XPS, these are used to study Mo2C and Co-Mo2C catalysts, not the iron-nickel catalysts mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.
