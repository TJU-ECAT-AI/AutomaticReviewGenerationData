The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts represent a crucial step in understanding their catalytic performance and potential applications. By employing a combination of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, researchers can delve into the intricacies of these catalysts at atomic and nanoscale levels. These methods allow for the elucidation of structural, chemical, and morphological properties, providing valuable insights into the nature of the active sites and their interactions with the support material. Techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy can reveal the oxidation states, local atomic arrangements, and surface composition of the catalysts. Additionally, in situ studies using environmental TEM or operando spectroscopy can capture dynamic changes in the catalysts under reaction conditions. By comparing the results obtained for Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2, researchers can identify key differences in active site properties that may explain variations in catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability between these two systems.
