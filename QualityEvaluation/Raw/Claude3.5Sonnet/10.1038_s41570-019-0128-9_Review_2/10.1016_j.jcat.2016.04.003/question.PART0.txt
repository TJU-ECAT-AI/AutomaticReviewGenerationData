1. Introduction
The need to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere is pushing toward the use of renewable carbon, so
to avoid as much as possible burning fossil carbon. Biomass is
synonym of renewable carbon, as it is re-generated from CO2,
usually captured from atmosphere. A close to zero emission cycle
can in principle be implemented that effectively reduces the emis-
sion of CO2. It would be possible to complement the natural car-
bon cycle by developing man-made industrial processes for
carbon recycling, converting, thus, spent carbon as CO2 into
working carbon, as that present in valuable chemicals or fuels.
Such practice would fall again into the utilization of renewable
carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the nat-
ural process. An order of complexity higher would be represented
by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective
CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even
whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for
energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind
or geothermal as primary energy.
These days all the above approaches are under investigation
with an interesting complementarity of publicprivate investment
in research.
This paper aimed at showing the state of the art of CO2 conver-
sion and giving a perspective view of such technology.
Each atom of C we can recycle is an atom of fossil carbon left in the
underground for next generations that will not reach the atmosphere
today.
1.1. Where we are
The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial
processes were developed as early as in the 18801893s, namely:
the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of

hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3].
Interestingly, in the former process CO2 recovered from the
synthesis of NH3 is used. In the 1900s there was not a great interest
in developing new applications of CO2. As a matter of fact, since the
late 1800s the chemistry of CO (derived from fossil carbon) has
been developed for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels that had
its golden era in the 19001970s, and still today plays a key role
in the production of chemicals and fuels. Only in the 1970s there
was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the
synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering
production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct
carboxylation. Table 1 gives the actual use of carbon dioxide in
the synthesis of chemicals and the perspective use at 2030 [6], cal-
culated considering the expected market growth for the listed
chemicals and assuming that new technologies will be developed
that ensure a large conversion of CO2. Data reported in Table 1
show that in the best of cases the utilization of CO2 will grow from
180 Mt/y in 2014 to 207 Mt/y in 2016 and 332 Mt/y in 2030: a drop
in the ocean of the over 35,000 Mt/y emitted today. Such scenario
validates the position of those who say that the conversion of CO2
into chemicals will not contribute to the CO2 emission reduction.
We anticipate that what has value is the amount of avoided CO2
more than the amount of used CO2: the ratio avoided/used may
span over a range 25, with a good average around 3.
This gives a different weight to the utilization option as 1 Gt/y
of avoided CO2 may be a realistic goal in 2030. Should CO2 be
converted into fuels, a new perspective opens and the Carbon
Capture and Utilization-CCU option may play a fundamental role
in avoiding CO2.
Table 1 also shows the oxidation state of the carbon-atom in the
various compounds listed. This is a key point as the energetics of
any reaction depends on the variation of the C-oxidation state in
the reaction. Fig. 1 shows the Gibbs free-energy of formation of
several C1 species.
It is quite evident that when the oxidation state of the carbon
atom is reduced from +4 in CO2 to 2 or lower, a significant amount
of energy is needed, while when the oxidation state remains +4 or
close to it (+3 in C2 species such as oxalic acid, HO2CACO2H) the
reaction is quasi-neutral (i.e., synthesis of organic carbonates and
carbamates, located in the circle around CO2) or even exothermic
as in the synthesis of inorganic carbonates, which lie well below
CO2. On this basis, in the middle 1980s we have classified the
CO2 reactions in two classes [7], according to the fact that CO2 is
incorporated such as in the product (Class A) or it is converted into
one of its reduced forms (Class B).
Class A: CO2 fixation into inorganic carbonates-M2CO3, organic
carbonates-(RO)2CO, carbamates-RR0NACO2R, polycarbonates,
polyurethanes, isocyanates-NCO.
Class B: CO2 reduction to CO or hydrogenated products such as
methanol, methane, and higher hydrocarbons.
Noticeably, the two classes are characterized by a distinct use of
the products and a quite different size of their market. Class A spe-
cies fall into the chemicals market, while Class B are fuels with a
market that is some 1214 times that of chemicals. Therefore, if
one targets to convert large volumes of CO2 one must pursue its
conversion into fuels. And here a new issue arises about the neces-
sary energy for the conversion (see Fig. 1) and the hydrogen for the
production of hydrocarbons. It is obvious that H2 cannot be derived
from fossil C, but must come from water or organic waste, while
energy must be supplied by perennial sources such as sun, wind,
and geothermal. A new approach must be developed for H2 pro-
duction with respect to the actual one based on the reforming (of
coke or methane) at high temperature, a strongly endergonic pro-
cess (Eqs. (1)(3)).

1.2. Key issues in the conversion of CO2
The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated
by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance
must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided
CO2 winning on that of used CO2. As a matter of fact, the use of
CO2 in new chemical processes can be quite interesting as it avoids
the emission of large volumes of CO2 (with respect to processes on
stream), much larger than that of the amount of converted CO2.
Correct values of used and avoided CO2 may be obtained by
applying the LCA methodology. An early example is given by the
use of LCA in the comparative analysis of different synthetic
methodologies for the production of cyclic carbonates [9]. It is
worth to emphasize that the correctness of the figures depends
on the quality of available data. At the time of the above study very
limited data were available. Today, more reliable data are loaded in
continuously up dated data bases and figures obtained from pilot
plants are more and more at the hand. This may assist to make a
much better estimate of new processes based on CO2. Fig. 2 shows
the amount of CO2 emitted in processes based on the use of
phosgene (on stream since the 1970s) vs the amount emitted in
innovative processes based on the use of CO2 [8].
It is clear that what really matters is not the amount of CO2 used
(0.5 t/tcarbonate) but the amount of CO2 avoided (the amount of CO2
emitted in the process based on phosgene (almost ca. 69 t/tcarbonate)
minus the amount of CO2 emitted in the direct carboxylation,
1.32 t/tcarbonate). A parameter that can be used for the assessment
of processes is the ratio of CO2 avoided/CO2 used. For the carboxyla-
tion of propene oxide (similar to reaction (a) in Fig. 2) it is estimated
to range around 3.5 today.
We now come to a key point: synthetic routes based on CO2
must respond to a stringent requisite, namely: the new process must
minimize the CO2 emission with respect to processes on stream. In
order to satisfy such condition, an immediate sub-condition is:
the CO2-based process must be a consumer and not a producer of CO2.
1.3. Performance indicators in CO2 conversion
Indicators which may help to assess a CO2-based process are as
follows:
(a) the carbon utilization fraction (the percentage of reagent-C
fixed into the products);
(b) the carbon-footprint (the CO2 emission in the process per
unit of product);
(c) the energy consumption factor (ratio of the input- to output-
energy);
(d) the waste production factor (waste produced per unit of
product, w/w);
(e) the avoided to used ratio.
The above indicators heavily depend on the reaction conditions.
The reaction parameter space is defined by the following factors:
i. Solvent; ii. co-reagents; iii. catalysts; iv. temperature; v. pres-
sure; vi. overall energy expenditure-time of reaction; vii. conver-
sion of reagents; viii. formation of co-products/selectivity of the
process; ix. waste generation; and x. end of process separation
energy.
In order to maximize the benefit, the above parameters must
respond to the conditions listed below:
i. The solvent can be one of the reagents. Solventless reactions
can be a good solution. The use of sc-CO2 may be beneficial.
ii. Co-reagents must be used in stoichiometric amount and be
converted at their maximum. This is particularly true when
H2 is used. Any excess must be recovered.
iii. Catalysts must be simple and cheap (earth abundant ele-
ments), recoverable, reusable.
iv. The temperature must be as low as possible, and selected
also taking into consideration the separation step. Tempera-
ture sweep must be avoided as the heat is not completely
recovered and reused (especially at low temperature) and
considerable energy loss occur.
v. The reaction pressure should be kept as low as possible.
Pressurized liquid reaction mixtures and sc-conditions must
be comparatively evaluated considering reaction rates, con-
version yields and selectivities.
vi. The overall energy expenditure must be kept as low as
possible.
vii. The conversion of reagents should be maximized.
viii. The formation of co-products should be minimized. Very
active catalysts may favor the occurrence of several reac-
tions at the same time, with increase of the conversion yield
but lowering selectivity and increasing the post-process sep-
aration cost. Often such co-products are formed from co-
reagents in equimolar amount with the target product. In
case of large-scale (>Mt) chemicals such co-products must
be either marketable or converted back into the original
co-reagent.
ix. The waste generation (including waste solvents) must be
minimized as waste will produce CO2 during its final
processing-burning.
x. The post-reaction process for product isolation may play a
key role in the overall energy expenditure. Sometimes it is
better to achieve a lower conversion with 100% selectivity
than a high conversion with formation of several byproducts
difficult to separate.
All
the
above
issues
are
considered
when
a
life
cycle
assessment-LCA study is performed. Such methodology is the one
that can give a reliable answer to the question whether a particular
use of CO2 is avoiding CO2 emission or increasing it. Having set
such a frame to the objective of using CO2 for the production of
chemicals and fuels, we can face the aspect of how we can use
CO2 in profitable ways that contribute to the reduction of the

2. CO2 properties, coordination chemistry and reactions
In this session we briefly discuss the electronic properties of
CO2 and the structural changes the cumulene undergoes upon
coordination to a metal center. These concepts are relevant to
any metal-driven conversion of CO2.
2.1. Electronic properties of CO2
CO2 has a linear geometry (D1h) in its ground state, with both
the carbonoxygen bonds being equivalent and displaying an equi-
librium CAO distance of 1.1600 Å [10,11]. The valence electronic
configuration of CO2 (16 valence electrons) in the linear ground
state, 1Rg
+, is 3rg
22ru
24rg
23ru
21pu
41pg
4 [12]. Fig. 3 shows a schematic
and simplified representation of the molecular orbitals (MOs) of
CO2.
Combination of 2s and 2pz of all the three atoms generates six r
molecular orbitals. Three couples of doubly degenerate reciprocally
orthogonal p-orbitals (1pux and 1puy; 1pgx and 1pgy; 2pux and
2puy) are obtained from combining the remaining 2px and 2py orbi-
tals of carbon and oxygens. The non bonding 1pgx and 1pgy MOs
have null weight on the carbon atom and, therefore, are localized
on the terminal oxygens, while the antibonding 2pux and 2puy
MOs are mainly localized on the carbon atom, as they have a
preponderant 2pxC and 2py character, respectively. Of the eight
occupied molecular orbitals, both 3rg and 2ru are responsible
for the r bonding skeleton of the molecule, while the 1pu orbitals
account for the CAO p bonds. By contrast, the electrons 4rg, 3ru
and 1pg are, r and p lone pairs, respectively.
Fig. 4 reports the Walsh diagram [13] for the CO2 molecule
showing qualitatively the variation of the MOs energies with the
change of OCO bond angle. The energies of the r-orbitals increase
or remain practically unaffected upon the change of molecular
symmetry (D1h ? C2v).
However, the energies of p-orbitals show more important
changes. The degeneracy of the p-orbitals is lost in the bent
geometry and the formerly degenerated p-orbitals separate in
two non-equivalent orbitals with different energies. The splitting
of the levels 1pu and 1pg is modest and the destabilization of
1pu(5a1)
is roughly counterbalanced by
the
stabilization of
1pu(1b1). By contrast, the energies of both 1pg orbitals increase
upon bending, much faster for 1pg(4b2) than for 1pg(1a2). The
energy of the 2pu(2b1) orbital is only slightly affected by the mole-
cule bending. The rapid increase of the energy of 1pg(4b2) with
diminution of the bond angle accounts for the linearity of the
CO2 molecule in the ground state. However, bending causes a
marked decrease of the energy of the 2pu(6a1) MO, which can
become even more stable than 1pg(4b2). The behavior of the
2pu(6a1) MO upon molecule bending suggests that population of
the 2pu(6a1) level is expected to produce a distortion of CO2 molecule
from linearity. This statement finds several validations, for instance,
when considering:
 the geometry of the CO2 lowest excited states, related with the
electronic configuration 1ru

Upon addition of an extra electron the CO2 molecule converts
into the radical anion CO2
 (Eq. (4)). The latter species, generated in
many ways and trapped in solid matrices, shows a bent equilibrium
geometry (C2v symmetry) in the 2A1 ground state ((1a1)2(1b2)2
(2a1)2(3a1)2(2b2)2(4a1)2(3b2)2
(1b1)2(5a1)2(1a2)2(4b2)2(6a1)1;
see
also Fig. 4), with elongated CO bonds and the value of OCO angle
ranging around 130 [15].
CO2  e ! CO

Reaction (4) is an endergonic process. A value of 0.6  0.2 eV
has been measured for the adiabatic electron affinity (EAad) of
the CO2 ground state [16]. In the gas phase CO2
 is metastable
against electron autodetachment. The reason for the metastability
of the anion (lifetimes in the range of 3090 ls) is ascribed to the
fact that the change of the molecular geometry from the 2A1 state
of CO2
 to the ground state of CO2, has a barrier of 0.4 eV [17]. Con-
version of CO2 to CO2
 anion is regarded as an important mode of
activating the molecule and represents the first of the reactive
steps leading to the partial or full reduction of the heterocumulene.
The change of geometry upon e transfer to CO2 may affect the rate
of the process. Such features are relevant to the electrochemical
reduction of CO2 as discussed in Section 4.2.
Removal of a 1pg electron from CO2 molecule to afford the CO2
+
radical cation in the
2Pg ground state requires an energy of
13.79 eV [18], by far larger than that needed for the formation of
the radical anion CO2
 [16] or for the dissociation of neutral CO2
to CO and atomic oxygen [19]. Spectroscopic measurements [20]
show that CO2
+ in its 2Pg ground state is a linear molecule with
D1h point group symmetry: the two CAO bonds are equivalent
with a length, which is only slightly longer (1.1769 Å) than that
measured in the neutral molecule. The above features are relevant
to the states of CO2 coordinated in different ways to various metal
systems (Fig. 4).
2.2. Spectroscopic (IR, UV, NMR) properties of CO2
IR and NMR spectroscopies have been widely employed as
diagnostic tools of the state of the CO2 molecule and even for quan-
titative determinations. UVvisible spectroscopy has found less
extensive use. However, the spectroscopic properties of CO2 in
the UV region are of fundamental importance for understanding
the photochemistry of this molecule [19].
Fig. 5 summarizes the spectroscopic properties of CO2 in the IR
region [2123].
Table 2 compares the IR fundamental frequencies of gaseous
CO2 with those measured for gaseous CO2
+ [24] and for CO2
 isolated
in solid neon [25,26] where the radical anion is free from interac-
tions with metal cations. In the IR spectrum of CO2
, because of the
bent geometry (C2v) of the anion, all the three normal vibration
modes are IR active. The stretching frequencies are shifted to lower
values, which reflect a reduced average CO bond order (1.5 in CO2
vs 2 in CO2).
As it will be discussed later, the formation of CO2 metal
complexes or, more generally, CO2-adducts can originate large
modifications
in
the
IR
spectrum
of
the
CO2
moiety
[27].
The antisymmetric stretching mode, ma(OCO), falls in the range
22501400 cm1,
the
symmetric
stretching
mode,
ms(OCO),
becomes IR-active and can absorb in the region 14001100 cm1,
the bending mode d(OCO) is shifted from 667 cm1. Additional
vibrational modes, such as metalcarbon and/or metaloxygen
stretching modes, C@O out-of-plane deformation, may be observed
in the low-frequency region (down to 300 cm1). The latter spec-
troscopic features can provide useful information on the bonding
mode of the heterocumulene in the adduct, so that IR is quite diag-
nostic for understanding the state of CO2 interacting with metal
systems (atoms or complexes).
Carbon dioxide is transparent in the visible and near-to-middle
ultraviolet regions, at least down to 210 nm (hm < 5.91 eV), both in
the liquid phase and in the gas phase [20]. Only weak absorptions
can be observed below 11 eV, in the vacuum ultraviolet region, at
147.5 (8.41 eV), 133.2 (9.31 eV) and 112.1 nm (11.08 eV), respec-
tively. Above 11 eV there are several Rydberg series converging
to the various states of CO2
+.
CO2 dissolved in a nonpolar solvent (benzene, toluene) displays
only one 13C NMR signal around 124 ppm. In aqueous solutions,
the resonance is close to 125 ppm and can be used for the quantifi-
cation of free CO2. 13C NMR has proved to be a very useful spectro-
scopic technique for identifying the CO2 moiety incorporated
into a metal-compound (metal complexes, metal-carbamates LnM
(O2CNR2), metal-hemicarbonates LnM(O2COR), metal-carboxylates
LnM(O2CR),
metallacarboxylic
acids
LnM(CO2H),
metallaesters
LnM(CO2R)) [28] or organic products, such as carbamic acids or
carbamates
(150160 ppm),
carbonates
(145165 ppm),
acids
(160180 ppm), esters (160170 ppm).
2.3. Main features of carbon dioxide reactivity
The MOs most relevant to the chemical reactivity of carbon
dioxide
are
the
doubly
occupied
non-bonding
1pg
orbitals
(HOMOs), mainly localized on the end oxygen atoms, and the
empty antibonding 2pu orbitals (LUMOs), mostly centered on the
carbon (Fig. 3). Therefore, CO2 can be considered an amphoteric
molecule, as it can act as an acceptor of electrons at the C-atom
(through the LUMOs) and a donor of electrons via the O-atoms
(through the HOMOs).
Electron poor centers (electrophiles such as the proton, metal
centers in high oxidation state, and electron deficient molecules)
are expected to attack CO2 at the O-atom. Noteworthy, CO2 dis-
plays a weak basic character, as demonstrated by the value of pro-
ton affinity of this molecule (Eq. (5)). The commonly accepted

for other O containing molecules, such as H2O, MeOH, Me2O,
H2CO, MeCHO, Me2CO, HCO2H, MeCO2H.

The electrophilic character of carbon dominates over the weak
nucleophilic properties of the oxygen atoms. Consequently, CO2
is a better acceptor than donor of electron density. Electrons and
electron rich species will easily interact with CO2 at the C-atom.
This reactivity is exemplified by the direct non metal-mediated
reactions of CO2 with electron rich anionic or neutral species such
as, for instance, H (Eq. (6)), OH (Eq. (7)), amines (vide infra).

Reaction of ionic (Group 1 or 2) hydrides with CO2 to afford the
relevant formate (Eq. (5)), albeit known since long time, has never
found any practical application for the synthesis of formates, which
are more conveniently synthesized by reaction of CO and the metal
hydroxides.
The reaction of CO2 with ionic metal hydroxides [M(OH)n]
(Eq. (7)) involves the nucleophilic attack of the anion (OH) to
the electrophilic carbon of CO2 [30]. The interest for this reaction
is linked to its utilization for the separation of CO2 from flue gases
[31] or for the fixation of CO2 into inorganic carbonates (Eq. (8))
that are under consideration for the safe long-term storage of
CO2 [32,33].

The reaction of CO2 with basic amines is of particular interest,
being exploited not only for up-taking CO2 from a gas stream,
but also for synthetic purposes [3436]. The reactivity of amines
with CO2 depends on their nature and the working conditions.
Under strictly anhydrous conditions, tertiary aliphatic amines do
not absorb CO2, but aliphatic primary and secondary amines do
and form the corresponding ammonium carbamates (Eq. (9))
[34,35] or the relevant carbamic acid (Eq. (10)) which may be
stabilized in a dimeric form through intermolecular hydrogen
bonding, both in solution [37] and in the solid state [38]. Carbamic
moieties play a key role as intermediates in several biological
processes,
such
as
carboxylations
by
biotin
enzymes
and
photosynthetic activation of CO2 promoted by RuBisCO (ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxidase) [39].

Different mechanisms have been proposed for the conversion of
amine and CO2 into alkylammonium carbamate [40], which may
involve the intermediate formation of a zwitterionic species
(Scheme 1) [41], or take place through a termolecular single step
(Scheme 2) [42]. Base B in Schemes 1 and 2 is the amine itself
under anhydrous conditions, but in an aqueous medium such role
may be played by H2O or OH. Whatever may be the working
mechanism, the key feature of the carbamation process is the
attack of the electron rich amine to the C-atom of CO2.
CO2 displays its amphoteric character in the reactions with frus-
trated Lewis pairs (FLPs) (Scheme 3) [4346].
The interest for FLPs as potential systems for activating the
heterocumulene has markedly grown in the last few years [47].
Remarkably, B/N, B/P, or Al/P based FLPs can also effect the stoi-
chiometric or catalytic reduction of the activated CO2 moiety upon
treatment with an appropriate reducing agent such as hydrobo-
ranes or hydrosilanes [4850]. Hydroboration and hydrosilylation
of CO2 to methoxyboranes and methoxysilanes, respectively, are
of significant academic interest, but remain costly processes with-
out industrial utility. Of greater interest, in this context, may be the
use of a reducing agent such as H2 [51], which is known to be
heterolytically activated by several FLPs. To date, this intriguing
field is still poorly investigated, but requires greater attention as
it may open perspectives toward the metal-free (or organic) cat-
alytic reduction of the heterocumulene.
2.4. Interaction of carbon dioxide with metal centers
The reactivity patterns outlined above can be recognized easily
when considering the behavior of CO2 as a ligand or, more
generally, the interaction of CO2 with metal centers. Despite the
significant advances achieved since the isolation and X-ray charac-
terization of the first metalCO2 complex [52], this field still repre-
sents a challenging research area. Basic studies on this topic are

welcome and new knowledge may be of fundamental importance
for potential exploitation. In fact, most reactions based on the uti-
lization of CO2 are driven by metal systems. Understanding the
interaction of the cumulene with metal centers, as well as the reac-
tivity of coordinated CO2, may be of great help in developing new
catalysts for CO2 conversion.
2.4.1. CO2 coordination to metal centers
The basic coordination modes of CO2 to a single metal center are
shown in Fig. 6 [53,54].
They reflect in a clear way the ability of CO2 to act as a pure
C-electrophile, (g1-C coordination), or O-nucleophile, linking the
metal through oxygen (g1-O or end-on coordination), or also to
act as an acceptor and donor of electron density, interacting, thus,
with the metal center through the C and O atoms, as in the case of
side-on (g2-C,O) coordination. The mode of bonding of CO2 to
metal centers has been extensively reviewed [5254], therefore
we discuss here only selected cases, which can be relevant to
catalytic processes.
Side-on coordination represents by far the most common
bonding mode of CO2. In [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] (Cy = cyclohexyl) [55],
the first crystallographically characterized metalCO2 complex,
the NiAC and NiAO1 bond distances are, respectively, 1.84 and
1.99 Å, showing that both carbon and one of the oxygen atoms
are
bound
to
the
nickel
center,
which
exhibits
a
planar
coordination.
The coordinated CO2 molecule looses the original D1h symme-
try, typical of the free ligand: the measured lengths for the CAO1
and CAO2 bonds (Fig. 7) are, respectively, 1.22 and 1.17 Å, while
the value of the OCO angle is 133. The deviation of the coordinated
CO2 molecule from linearity is well in accordance with the features
foreseen considering the Walsh diagram.
Examples of bis(carbon dioxide) side-on complexes are also
known, but only with molybdenum. An example is provided by
trans-Mo(CO2)2HN(CH2CH2PMe2)2(PMe3) [56]. The complex has a
distorted octahedral geometry with two staggered CO2 ligands
g2-C,O-coordinated to Mo. The CO2 ligands show CAO lengths
ranging from 1.199 to 1.284 Å and OCO angles of 131.
The
dinuclear
complex
[(IPr)Ni]2(l-CO)
(l-g2,g2-CO2)
(IPr = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene)
docu-
ments an interesting case of a l2-g2,g2-coordination, in which
each C@O bond of the bridging CO2 ligand is, respectively, side-
on coordinated to a Ni atom [57] (Fig. 8). In principle, side-on
adducts may be considered as three-membered oxametallacycles
resulting from a formal oxidative addition of one of the p-bonds
of the CO2 ligand to the metal center or as p-complexes, wherein
the metalCO2 interaction involves both electron donation from
the O-centered 1puy(5a1) and 1pgy(4b2) orbitals of CO2 to empty
d-orbitals of M and, at a greater extent, electron back-donation
from a filled d-orbital of metal to the empty C-centered 2puy(6a1)
orbital of the ligand [58].
This point is relevant to the definition of the oxidation state of
the metal center M: is it zero, one or two? However, whatever
model may be followed, in these systems the CO2 ligand always
acts simultaneously as electron-donor through an end oxygen
and electron-acceptor at the central carbon. The ability of CO2 to
act as a bifunctional system is further documented by the plethora
of CO2 complexes in which the cumulene bridges two or more
metal centers through carbon and one or both oxygens [5254].

complexes with the metal centers bound to O and C.

Rh(diars)2(Cl)(CO2) (diars = o-phenylene-bis(dimethyl)arsine) pro-
vides an example of the behavior of CO2 ligand acting as a only-
C-electrophile (Fig. 9) [59]. Rh is essentially octahedral with the
CO2 ligand trans to chlorine and interacting with the nucleophilic
metal center through the central carbon (g1-C coordination). In
the adduct, the C-O distances, 1.20(2) and 1.25(2) Å respectively,
are longer than in the free cumulene, while the OCO angle is
126. The above structural data indicate an important pouring of
electron density from metal into the empty antibonding 2pu(6a1)
orbital, which weakens the CAO bonds and causes a remarkable
bending of the coordinated CO2 molecule (Fig. 4).
g1-C coordination has been claimed or demonstrated also in a
few other Rh, Ir and Ru complexes [6062]. Generally, g1-C com-
plexes are less stable than g2-C,O complexes and are regarded as
reversible carriers of carbon dioxide. The stability of the MAC bond
strongly depends on the donor properties of the metal center. Often
g1-C complexes can be further stabilized by an intramolecular
hydrogen bonding interaction between the O-atom of CO2 ligand
and hydrogen donor centers [63]. As discussed below, the interac-
tion with external Lewis centers may also occur. It is worth noting
that such an interaction may play a key role in stabilizing adducts of
CO2 also with non-metal species. In 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-c
arboxylate,
obtained by
reaction of
1-methylimidazole
with
dimethyl
carbonate
[64],
the
imidazolium
C-carbene
binds
CO2 at C by using the free couple of electrons. The resulting
C ? CO2 moiety is formally similar to the M ? CO2 system: in the
solid adduct, the carboxylate moiety is stabilized through the
interaction of the nucleophilic O-atoms with the imidazolium-
ring hydrogens. In the last two decades, the chemistry of
N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) with CO2 has received great atten-
tion and NHCs and related complexes offer interesting perspectives
as potential systems for capture, fixation, and activation of CO2 [65].
End-on (g1-O) coordination mode has remained elusive for a long
time. Only more recently, a few genuine examples of isolated and
structurally characterized adducts in which CO2 acts exclusively as
an O-nucleophile (g1-O or end-on coordination) have been
described in the literature [6669].
The
uranium-complex
(AdArO)3tacnU(g1-OCO)
((AdArO)3
tacn =
1,4,7-tris(adamantyl-5-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)1,4,7-
triazacyclononane), obtained by reacting the complex (AdArO)3
tacnUIII with CO2 has provided the first evidence of (g1-O) coordi-
nation [66,70]. The OCO moiety is almost linear (OCO angle = 178)
with the terminal CO bond length (1.277(4) Å) longer than the
internal CO bond distance (1.122(4) Å). The structural data show
that, when CO2 behaves exclusively as an O-nucleophile, the coor-
dinated CO2 molecule essentially retains its original linear geome-
try or undergoes only slight distortion from linearity, as expected
when there is not a significant back-donation of electron density
into the 2pu orbitals of the heterocumulene.
Examples of l-g1(O), g1(O) coordination have been also
described and structurally characterized [68,69]. In these systems
the CO2 molecule bridges two distinct metal centers through the
end O atoms as shown in Fig. 10. Systems of particular applicative
interest are represented by a few polyoxometalate anions, such as
for instance (H2PMo11CoO40)5, which reacts with aqueous CO2
affording the CO2-adduct (C3H5N2)3(C3H4N2)(PMo11CoO38(CO2))
4H2O, where CO2 is (l-g1,g1) coordinated through the end oxygen
atoms [69]. This compound consists of (PMo11CoO38)n polymeric
chains bridged by the almost linear CO2 ligand (OCO angle: 158)
in an axial direction. Such behavior is of great interest as it opens
an intriguing perspective on the use of polyoxometalates as CO2
capturing agents in aqueous medium.
Further insight in understanding the reactivity of CO2 with
metal centers comes from the study of the interaction of the CO2
molecule with naked metal atoms in a gas matrix at low temper-
ature (<20 K). FTIR spectroscopy and density functional theory
(DFT), are helpful in discovering their behavior [71], the most fre-
quently observed reactions being the formation of a metal complex
and the insertion into one the C@O bonds, depending on the nature
of the metal [72], i.e. its oxophilicity.
For instance, early transition metals (strong oxophiles) exhibit a
different behavior relative to late transition metals [71,72]. Ti, V
and Cr (or early transition metals, in general) insert spontaneously
into one of the C@O bonds yielding oxo-carbonyl species OM(CO)
even without energy barrier (Ti), while Fe, Co, Ni, Ag and Cu (late
transition metals)] form 1:1 M(CO2) adducts in which the cumu-
lene may display different coordination modes, depending on
metal. A side-on bonding was found for Ni, an O-end-on for Cu, a
g1-C for Fe and Co. Noteworthy, in a few cases, the same coordina-
tion modes were found for naked atoms and the relevant metal
complexes, which is not a general rule as the ancillary ligands L
may significantly influence the behavior of the metal center
toward CO2, influencing the electron density and governing the
space availability [70].
2.4.2. Reactivity of coordinated CO2
Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces
marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR)
properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O
bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance) [73].
The question rises whether coordinated CO2, in whatever form in
metalcomplexes, can be considered an activated form with
respect to the free molecule, and, thus, which are the effects of
coordination on the reactivity of the cumulene and if there is a pre-
ferred mode of bonding for the conversion of CO2. Also, one can ask
whether spectroscopic data can be informative about the mode of
bonding of the cumulene and can, thus, be used for predicting its
reactivity. The rationalization of the whole matter is far from hav-
ing been accomplished and further fundamental studies are still
necessary. Another intriguing issue that must be addressed when
investigating the reactivity of CO2metal complexes in solution is
relevant to the fluxionality of the bonded cumulene: does CO2
maintain the same mode of bonding in solution as in the solid state
for a given adduct? This key aspect has been addressed only in a
very few cases. For instance, 31P and 13C VT NMR studies carried
out on [Ni(CO2)(PCy3)2] have allowed to conclude that in solution,
at 173 K, carbon dioxide is bonded to Ni as in the solid state, but at
room temperature carbon dioxide is fluxional with an intramolec-
ular motion that, most likely, involves the disanchorage of the car-
bon atom from nickel (Fig. 7, bottom) to afford an g1-O
intermediate [74]. Such fluxionality makes the two phosphines
equivalent in solution at room temperature, which are not equiva-
lent in the solid state (Fig. 7).
In principle, coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either
electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. In general, the C-atom of CO2
bound to a metal in the g1-C or g2-C,O-coordination mode is
expected to be less prone to react with nucleophilic species than
the free molecule. However, if g1-O-coordination of cumulene is
considered, then the nucleophilic attack at C should be a more
likely process. However, reactions of CO2 complexes with nucle-
ophiles are poorly documented in the literature and knowledge
in this field is very lacunose. A nucleophilic attack has been pro-
posed to be working in the Wittig-like reaction of (PCy3)2Ni(g2-
CO2) with Me3P = CH2 ylide to give the ketene complex (Cy3P)2Ni
(g2-C,O)-CH2CO and Me3PO [75]. This reactivity is relevant to the

formation of CAC bonds and opens a question about the necessity
to have a coordinated CO2 because a CAC coupling may occur.
Electrophilic attack is better documented. Both g1-C and side-
on coordinated CO2 have been shown to display an enhanced reac-
tivity at oxygen toward electrophiles and electrophilic attack is the
prevalent reactivity of CO2-bridged complexes with alkali cations
[60,7678].
Of great interest is the protonation of coordinated CO2, which
may occur under very mild conditions (<273 K) and affords CO as
product. The electrons required for the reduction of CO2 to CO
are provided by the metal (Eq. (11)), which is oxidized, or may
be furnished by an external source.
LnMCO2  2H ! LnM2  CO  H2O
11
The utilization of PhSH as source of protons and electrons in the
reaction with (PCy3)2Ni(g2-CO2) has been demonstrated, providing
an interesting biomimetic system [79]. Unfortunately, in this sys-
tem CO remains tightly bound to Ni and diphenyldisulfide adds
oxidatively to Ni(0) to give P2Ni(SPh)2 (Eqs. (12)(14)). These
events prevent the reduction process to proceed catalytically with
respect to nickel.

The above process (Eq. (11)) is strictly related to the more gen-
eral reaction of dissociative reduction of CO2 to CO (Eq. (15)).
This is the simplest way to convert CO2. The process is very energy

intensive, and, can be carried by a thermal (a high T > 1200 K) or a
radiative route (using high energy radiations, <160 nm). As shown
in Fig. 11a, this process is of great applicative interest if energy from
natural sources other than fossils fuels (for instance concentrators
of solar power, CSP) are used, as the formed CO, in turn, is both
an energy source and a synthetically exploitable source of carbon.
A cyclic process that runs on CO2CO couple and makes use of
perennial energy sources (solar energy) as energy input is very
appealing. Metal oxides (Eqs. (16) and (17)) are under considera-
tion as catalysts for such reaction using concentrators of solar
power (CSP) that allow to operate at high temperature. When
CO2 splitting is coupled with water splitting using CSP, it is possible
to produce Syngas (plus oxygen) from CO2 and water, and, thus,
liquid fuels by Fischer Tropsch.

17
This high-temperature catalytic splitting is of great importance
for the exploitation of CO2 and H2O as source of Syngas for the pro-
duction of solar liquid fuels (methanol, DME, gasoline, diesel).
CAO bond cleavage with consequent formation of CO and O
transfer to an oxophile is a reaction frequently observed for
g2- and g1-C CO2-complexes. The effect of coordination to a metal
is evident as the deoxygenation of CO2 can be performed even at
room temperature using the suited metal center and an oxophile.
Formed CO is often found coordinated to the metal center. The oxo-
phile acts as oxygen sink. Both these features contribute to drive
the dissociative reduction of CO2 to the right. The role of O-sink
may be played by the metal atom itself (Eq. (18)) [80], or with less
oxophilic metals (late transition metals, for instance) by CO2 itself
(Eq. (19)) [81] with conversion of two CO2 molecules into CO e
CO3
2, or by a ligand. For instance, phosphines, PR3 [55], can be con-
verted by this way into their oxides (O = PR3) (Eq. (20)), products of
very limited utility and difficult to reduce back to the parent com-
pounds if not using energy intensive reducing agents (metals)
which cancel out the benefit of having the CO2 splitting running
at room temperature.

In principle, the deoxygenation process can be coupled with the
production of useful chemicals, for instance by using as the oxo-
phile a suitable organic substrate (Sub, in Fig. 11b). Such applica-
tion may be limited by the market of the species Sub = O that can
be generated. Suitable O-acceptors may be olefins (Eq. (21)) as
their oxidized forms (epoxides) may have wide market as mono-
mers for polymers. Eq. (21) is not a straightforward process and
may occur if mediated by metal oxides as catalysts in a two-step
process: transfer of O-atom from a metal oxide to the olefin [82]
and reoxidation of the reduced oxide with CO2.
21
The epoxide can react with CO2 to afford a cyclic carbonate. To
date, this process, although of interest, has been demonstrated
only at the laboratory scale.
The use of CO2 as soft and selective oxidant has been demon-
strated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene
(Eq. (22)) [83].
C6H5ACH2CH3  CO2 ! C6H5ACH@CH2  CO  H2O
22
CO  H2O ! CO2  H2
23
C6H5ACH2CH3 ! C6H5ACH@CH2  H2
24
As H2O and CO can be processed to afford H2 and CO2 (WGS)
(Eq. (23)), the net reaction is represented in Eq. (24) in which
CO2 acts as promoter of the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
favoring milder conditions and higher selectivity with respect to
pure dioxygen.
Currently the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant has been extended to
oxidative coupling of methane to ethane and ethylene and oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons (such as propane
to propene) and there is still a lot of scope for its use in other reac-
tions [83].

2.4.3. Relevance of CO2 coordination to chemical utilization of CO2.
Synthesis of formic acid
The use of CO2 as synthon in chemical synthesis for manufactur-
ing bulk or fine chemicals has been pursued since the 1980s. A key
issue is the relevance of CO2 coordination in such processes: is CO2
coordination a strict prerequisite for its conversion? An answer can
be given only by mechanistic studies on reactive systems. Any a
priori attempt to foresee the behavior of reactive systems is a pure
guess. The thermal lability of CO2 complexes and their tendency to
dissociate coordinated CO2 may add complexity and uncertainty to
the problem. As an example, let us consider the reaction of
(PCy3)2Ni(CO2) with dioxygen: the product would be the peroxo-
carbonate (PCy3)2Ni(CO4) (Eq. (25)) and one would foresee that
reaction (25) may proceed via O2 insertion into the NiAC bond of
the g2-C,O form.
PCy32NiCO2s  O2g ! PCy32NiCO4s
25
Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that it proceeds
instead through carbon dioxide decoordination, dioxygen coordi-
nation to Ni, and CO2 insertion into the OAO bond of the newly
formed, reactive (PCy3)2Ni(O2) complex [84]. Interestingly, using
the (PPh3)3RhCl(O2) complex and labeled O2 and CO2 species
(16O2, 18O2, 16O2
12C, 18O2
12C, 16O2
13C) it has been confirmed using
FTIR and NMR studies that the formation of the peroxocarbonate
moiety occurs via CO2 insertion into the OAO bond more than into
the RhAO bond of the dioxygen-Rh complex [85].
However, whether or not the coordination of CO2 is a prerequi-
site for further reaction depends on the kind of reaction CO2 has to
undergo. For sure, coordination to a metal center is necessary if the
reduction of CO2 to CO is considered (via O-transfer or protonation
at O). In other cases, CO2 pre-coordination to metal centers may
not be necessary, as discussed later on.
The insertion reactions of CO2 into MAE (E = H, C, N, O, etc.) bonds
are key steps of stoichiometric processes and catalytic cycles
implying CO2 incorporation into organic substrates with the gener-
ation of a new EAC bond. Often these reactions are initiated by
nucleophilic attack of E (in MAE) at the electrophilic carbon of
CO2 and assisted by weaker interactions between the metal center
and the lone pairs of one of the O-atoms of the cumulene.
This is the case of the insertion of CO2 into MAO bond of metal-
hydroxo (LnMAOH) and metal alkoxo (LnMAOR) complexes. The
insertion reaction of CO2 into a covalent polar MAOH bond affords
a hydrogen carbonate species (Eq. (26)) that can be stable or can
react further. This reaction is strictly related to the conversion of
CO2 into anionic or coordinated HCO3
 and the elusive acid
H2CO3, a transformation that plays a key role in the respiratory
process of humans and animals. The Zn-enzyme Carbonic Anhy-
drase (CA) can accelerate the reaction of hydration-dehydration
of CO2, facilitating, thus, CO2 up-take at cellular level and elimina-
tion in lungs from where it is expulsed [86]. It is now recognized
that this enzymatic process implies the nucleophilic attack of a
Zn2+-bound hydroxyl group at free CO2, which is held in place by
hydrogen bonds within the pocket of the active site of the enzyme.
The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a
metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial inter-
est as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates
and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates
such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides. A variety of LnMAOR com-
plexes have been investigated and also tested as catalysts in
LnMAOH  CO2 ! LnMAOCOOH

27
synthetic chemistry and co-polymerization processes [8789]. The
transition state of such reaction can be represented as in Fig. 12
and implies the interaction of the electrophilic C of CO2 with the
oxygen of the OR group [90,91]. Preliminary coordination of CO2
to the metal center is not necessary in this class of reactions.
The insertion of CO2 into the MAN bond of metalAamido com-
plexes (LnMANR2) generates a new CAN bond and affords
metalAcarbamato complexes, which are important intermediates
in the synthesis
LnMANR2  CO2 ! LnMAO2CNR2
28
of carbamate esters, isocyanates, amides [34,35,92]. Also this pro-
cess does not require, as a preliminary step, the coordination of
CO2. In fact, the reaction can proceed via attack of free CO2 to the
nitrogen atom of metalamido-complex [93]. However, because of
the aptitude of metalamides and metalcarbamates to hydrolyze,
it is possible also an amine-catalyzed mechanism summarized by
reactions (29) and (30) [94]. Trace amounts of amine can be fortu-
itously present in solutions of M(NMe2)n compounds as a result of
M(NMe2)n hydrolysis due to adventitious water. Under the working
conditions (CO2 in excess relative to amine), the free amine can
interact with the heterocumulene to produce carbamic acid R2-
NCO2H, which reacts as shown in Eq. (30).

According to the above mechanism the formation of the metal
carbamate complex should be better regarded as a ligand substitu-
tion, rather than a true insertion process. This reaction pathway
has been largely exploited from the synthetic point of view for
the preparation of a great number of metal carbamate adducts
(Eq. (31)) [34,35].

(X = H, Cl, alkyl, OR, ClO4, etc.)
The CO2 insertion into a MAH or MAC bond can occur according
to two different modes, which are usually designated as normal
and abnormal mode (Scheme 5) [54,95,96].
The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation
in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the
nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands. The normal
insertion mode affords metal-formates (E = H) or, more generally,
metal-carboxylates (E = C), while the abnormal mode generates
a metalla-carboxylic acid (E = H) or a metalla-ester (E = C). Such
insertion reactions are important steps in stoichiometric or cat-
alytic processes leading to the synthesis of carboxylic acids and
carboxylate esters.
To date, very little is known about the abnormal insertion path
for which only a few claims exist [54,95,96]. The MACO2H species

is proposed [97] to be present and active in several processes
implying MH-species and CO2, but a clear-cut demonstration of
CO2 insertion into the MAH bond of a transition metal complex
to afford M-CO2H is not found in the literature. Conversely,
MACO2H species have been generated by chemical or electro-
chemical protonation of MACO2 complexes, either g2-C,O or g1-C.
The reactivity of MAH/CO2 systems has reached high levels of
attention because of its relevance to reactions that may have
industrial interest such as the hydrogenation of CO2 to afford for-
mic acid (Eq. (32)) and the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to
other C1 or C1+ molecules.

What is the role of CO2 coordination in this insertion process
(Scheme 5, (a); E@H) has been matter of several theoretical and
experimental studies. Both paths represented in Scheme 6 are
possible, depending on the nature of the metal center [98100].
The nature of the reaction medium may also play a key role in influ-
encing the mechanistic pathway [100]. However, the whole matter
still waits for a full rationalization.
The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by tran-
sition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty
years. The interest toward such a process is mainly due to the
potential of formic acid as hydrogen-carrier, as the two reactions,
(i) carbon dioxide hydrogenation using molecular dihydrogen
and (ii) decomposition of formic acid into the starting carbon diox-
ide and dihydrogen, give a quasi-CO2-neutral cycle. Currently,
worldwide production of formic acid, obtained from the combina-
tion of methanol and carbon monoxide with a strong base, is in the
order of 0.8 Mt/y and is used in the textile industry, cleaning and as
a preservative. Demand could increase markedly due to the devel-
opment of efficient formic acid dehydrogenation catalysts that
could find widespread application within the context of a hydrogen
economy [101].
A limitation of the approach is the unfavorable thermodynamics
of reaction (32). However, the formation of formic acid is more
favorable in a condensed medium such as water (Eq. (33), DG
 = 4 kJ mol1), where the CO2/H2CO3/HCO3
 equilibrium as well
as the second deprotonation to CO3
2 must be taken into account,
or if a base is used that produces formate salts instead of free
formic acid, (Eq. (34), DG = 35 kJ mol1) [102].
Under the latter conditions the actual substrate is HCO3
 or CO3
2
rather than CO2.

Another drawback is the kinetic stability of the intermediate
hydrido-formate species LnMH(OCHO): breaking of the MAO and
MAH bonds can represent the real kinetic barrier to the process.
Overcoming
the
above
kinetic
and
thermodynamic
barriers
requires the use of a shuttle. Either Group 1 metal cations are
used for the extraction of the formate moiety, or amines which
are able to extract H. This has for long time prevented the exploita-
tion of carbon dioxide hydrogenation as a catalytic direct route to
free HCO2H despite catalysts have been developed that have a high
TON (several millions) and TOF [103,104] toward the salt. In fact,
either the ammonium- or the Group 1 metal-formate that are
produced need treatment with inorganic acid (such as H2SO4) for
the production of the free acid. Such acid treatment produces
equimolar (relative to HCO2H) amounts of waste inorganic salts.
Very recent reports have opened interesting perspectives about
the possible exploitation of the direct synthesis of free formic acid
from CO2 and H2 in acidic media, without the need of any bases,
amines or buffers. Lawrenczy has shown that it is possible to pro-
duce free formic acid by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide by carry-
ing out the reaction in water or DMSO, without using any additive,
in the presence of Ru-catalysts (RuCl2(1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaada
mantane) and other related ligands) [102].This finding represents
a breakthrough in this field and can open the way to an exploita-
tion of the reaction.
Oxidative coupling reactions of CO2 with unsaturated molecules
X@Y (Scheme 7), such as olefins, dienes, cumulenes, alkynes,
g2-aryne, nitroso- or diaza-compounds and hetero-olefins (imines,
carbodiimides, azadienes or aldehydes) [7,54,73,105113], are key
steps toward the functionalization of the above substrates.
These reactions generate a new CAY bond (Y = C, N, O), and
open an alternative route, in addition to the insertion reactions,
to the incorporation of the heterocumulene into a variety of new
carboxylated products (acids, esters, lactones, pyrones, etc.), often
characterized by complex molecular structures largely used in the
production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.
The coupling reaction is promoted by a low-oxidation state
transition metal center (Ni, Mo, Fe, Mn, Pd, Rh, Pt, etc.), which
undergoes oxidation, and affords a five-membered metallahetero-
cycle, as shown in Scheme 7(a). Remarkably, in the known exam-
ples, the oxygen of carbon dioxide more than the C-atom binds
to the metal (Scheme 7(b)).
The relevance of CO2 coordination in such processes is another
open issue, which has been addressed in detail only in a few cases.
In principle, the above couplings can take place through one of the
routes (i)(iii) below:

The head-to-tail CO2 homocoupling at the Ir center of IrCl(C2O4)
(PMe3)3 (Scheme 8) necessarily implies the intermediacy of a
CO2-Ir adduct and may follow pathway (a) [81]. However, the
mechanistic details are not known. The reaction is believed to be
initiated by the nucleophilic addition of IrCl(C8H14)(PMe3)3 to
CO2 (O(3)C(2)O(4)), with the resultant more nucleophilic oxygen
(O(3)) binding a second CO2 molecule (O(2)C(1)O(1)) through C
(1). Cyclization via IrAO(1) bond formation affords the product.
Pathway (b) has been documented experimentally for the
oxidative
coupling
CO2/propionaldehyde
[112]
(X@C,
Y@O;
Scheme 7) and CO2/isoprene (X@Y@C; Scheme 7) [113] at a Ni(0)
center for which the activation parameters have been measured
(DH = 43  6 kJ/mol
and
DS = 129  19 J/mol K
[112];
DH = 25  7 kJ/mol; DS = 184  24 J/mol K [113], respectively).
Several examples of oxidative coupling CO2/olefin or CO2/alkyne
have been reported [7,105,106,114,115]. To date, the hypothesis
that coordinated CO2 might react with free alkene/alkyne to gener-
ate a metalla-lactone has not found sound experimental support.
For instance, despite Ni(0)-complexes are very effective in promot-
ing the oxidative coupling of CO2/olefin, Aresta et al. found that Ni
(CO2)(PCy3)2, in the solid state, did not react with gaseous ethene
even after three hours at room temperature. In solution, a substitu-
tion reaction occurred easily with formation of Ni(PCy3)2(C2H4)
[7,74,116], showing that ethene is more tightly bound to Ni
(PCy3)2 than CO2. Accordingly, earlier DFT calculations carried
out for the systems ethene/CO2 [117] and alkyne/CO2 [118,119]
in the presence of Ni(0) bearing N-donor ligands, ruled out that
the oxidative coupling of CO2 with the above substrates (alkene/
alkyne) at Ni(0) may involve the interaction of a NiACO2 complex
with the unsaturated substrate used (Eq. (35b)) or proceed through
an associative mechanism involving the intermediate formation of
a mixed substrate-carbon dioxide Ni-complex (Eq. (36c)). The
calculations indicate that the coupling reaction involves the activa-
tion of the olefin by coordination at the metal center and the sub-
sequent reaction of the activated substrate with an incoming CO2
molecule (Eq. (36b)), as shown by previous experiments [116].
However, suitably changing the nature of ancillary ligands or
metal center may open new mechanistic pathways and, for
instance, shift the mechanism of olefin/CO2 oxidative coupling
toward pathway (c) (Eq. (36c)). For instance, a theoretical work
supports that oxidative coupling ethene-CO2 at nickel centers bear-
ing bidentate phosphorous ligands can proceed through sequential
coordination of ethene and CO2 to Ni with formation of an ethene
CO2Ni-complex LNi(C2H4)(CO2), wherein, however, CO2 is only
weakly bound to Ni [120]. Pathway (c) was originally postulated
by Carmona for the reaction of trans-M(C2H4)2(PMe3)4 with
CO2
affording
the
binuclear
hydrido-acrylate
complex
l-(CH2@CHCOO)2[HM(C2H4)(PMe3)2]2 (Scheme 9) [121].
DFT calculations (carried out for M@Mo) have confirmed the
consistency of the mechanism illustrated in Scheme 9 [122].
Coordination of CO2 molecule to the metal center with formation
of the CO2-bis-ethene complex Mo(C2H4)2(CO2)(PMe3)3 is a neces-
sary step to achieve the CO2-alkene coupling, because the formation
of the new CAC bond is promoted by a simultaneous metal ? CO2
and metal ? C2H4 electron donation mechanism. The formation
of the metalla-lactone species is, thermodynamically, allowed and
the activation barrier has been estimated to be 11 kcal/mol. The
five-membered metallacycle converts into a metal-hydride species
through an exothermic b-hydrogen transfer step showing a calcu-
lated energy barrier of 10 kcal/mol. The hydrido-acrylate monomer
is already well below the energy of the reactants, but further stabi-
lization is achieved through the dimerization process.
The mechanism of ethene carboxylation at a Mo center has been
investigated also experimentally [123], following the conversion of
trans-(triphos)Mo(C2H4)(N2)2
(triphos = (Ph2PCH2CH2)2PPh)
and
CO2
into
the
bridging
acrylate
hydride
complex,
[(triphos)
MoA(H)(OC(O)CH@CH2)]2 (Scheme 10). The observation of the
intermediate complex (triphos)Mo(C2H4)(CO2) on the path to
CAC bond formation (Scheme 10) provides the first experimental
evidence that simultaneous coordination of both ethene and car-
bon dioxide at a metal center is a prerequisite for coupling the
two unsaturates. This behavior is somewhat different from what
described to occur at nickel centers. It has been suggested that
the requirement of precoordination of both CO2 and olefin, while
being less stringent for late transition metal centers like Ni, may
be more likely for early transition metal centers.
However, at present, generalizations may be rash. Knowledge in
this field is still lacunose and further studies are required to fully
elucidate, for a given M/X@Y/CO2 system, the role of the metal cen-
ter and ancillary ligands in marking the mechanistic pathway of
the coupling reaction.
3. Conversion of CO2 into chemicals
3.1. CO2 as a C1-synthon for the synthesis of intermediates and fine
chemicals
The incorporation of carbon dioxide into organic substrates tells
in a clear way the huge potential of the cumulene as C1-synthon
for the synthesis of fine and commodity chemicals [36,124130].
These reactions allow to build up new CACO2AH, CACO2AC,
EACO2 (E = N, O) moieties and lead to the direct carboxylation of
the organic substrate with formation of new products such as car-
boxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates, and carbonates. Such
synthetic approach is of great importance from the industrial point
of view as the target products have a large market of the order of
several Mt/y. Moreover, the exploitation of such synthetic method-
ology would allow the implementation of more direct or safer syn-
thetic routes in place of those on-stream that do not respond to the
energy- or atom-economy principles or make use of toxic and
harmful starting materials such as phosgene, opening thus, and
intriguing new perspectives of development of a more sustainable
chemistry. In fact, with respect to processes on stream, the utiliza-
tion of CO2 for the synthesis of carboxylated compounds bears
several benefits such as: reduce the production of waste, recycle
carbon, and make less use of solvents if supercritical CO2 (scCO2)
is used as solvent and reagent. Because of the more direct syn-
thetic approach, there may also be a lower energy consumption.
Such benefits may be accurately evaluated by using the LCA

methodology, applied to the CO2-based process and to the process
that is being substituted [131].
One can foresee that in general, the energetics of the carboxyla-
tion processes will be acceptable, the energy required for CO2 con-
version being contributed by the co-reagent, which is an electron-
rich species. This is the case of carboxylation reactions in which the
carbon atom maintains the formal +4 oxidation state, as in carba-
mation or carbonation reactions (Fig. 1). To such processes, those
bearing to the formation of carboxylates RCOOH(R) (e.g., acids,
esters, and lactones), in which the C-atom has an oxidation state
of +3, can be added. Also these reactions may be thermodynami-
cally feasible but, at least in a few cases, they may show some ther-
modynamic or kinetic constraints.
In the following sections special attention will be devoted to
compounds such as carboxylic acids, esters, lactones, carbamates,
isocyanates, ureas, carbonates, due to their industrial importance.
3.1.1. Oxidative coupling with olefins: synthesis of acrylic acids and
acrylates
As previously emphasized (Section 2.4.3), CO2 and olefins can
react in the presence of a suitable metal center and form a
metallacyclo-carboxylate (A) (Scheme 11). Such species have been
isolated and characterized in a number of cases [54,73,110].
Scheme 11 shows two possible ways through which, in principle,
(A) may further react, once formed. Formation of b-lactone, which
may form from
by reductive elimination, has
never been observed experimentally. On the other hand, the
metalla-lactone may generate, through a b-H shift reaction, a
metal-hydrido-acrylate species (B).
Species like (B), which have been isolated (M = Mo, W) and fully
characterized [121,123], have drawn great attention for their
potential as precursors of acrylic acids RHC = CH2C(O)OH which,
in principle, might be generated by reductive elimination. Acrylic
acid is the simplest unsaturated carboxylic acid and is a building
block for hundreds consumer products. The global acrylic acid
market was valued at $11006.6 million in 2013, and it is estimated
to reach $18824.0 million by 2020, growing at a rate of 7.6% during
the forecast period (from 2014 to 2020) [132]. The global con-
sumption of acrylic acid is anticipated to reach 8169.0 kt by
2020. Acrylic acid, CH2@CHCO2H, is used in a number of industrial
applications. The primary use of acrylic acid is in the production of

adhesives. A growing use of acrylic acid Group 1 metal derivatives
is in the production of supersorbent polymers.
It is also used in oil treatment chemicals, detergent intermedi-
ates, water treatment chemicals, and water absorbent polyacrylic
acid polymers. It is currently manufactured at an industrial scale
by two-stage oxidation of propene (Eq. (37)), a byproduct of hydro-
carbon cracking and naphtha refining. This process employs hetero-
geneous catalysts consisting of metal oxides such as vanadium and
molybdenum to oxidize propene to acrolein in the first step.

The synthesis of acrylic acid based on the direct combination of
ethene with CO2 (Eq. (38)) is, in principle, a very attractive alterna-
tive as it is 100% atom economical as all the atoms of the reactants
are found in the target product.
Hoberg [133], in the early 1980s, first reported the (sub)stoi-
chiometric formation of cinnamic acid, PhCH@CH2C(O)OH, from
styrene and CO2, in the presence of Ni(cod)2 and DBU. Since then,
the catalytic synthesis of acrylic acids by direct coupling of olefins
with CO2 has greatly attracted the interest of chemists. However, to
date, this goal still remains unaccomplished. In fact, going back to
Scheme 11, either (A) or (B) may be stable species which prevent
spontaneous release of acrylic acid. Theoretical and/or experimen-
tal
studies
[122,123]
support
(see
Section
2.4.3)
that
the
conversion of the five-membered metallacycle (A) into the metal-
hydride species (B) at a Mo or W center is a both thermodynami-
cally and kinetically accessible step, but the hydrido-acrylate
monomer (B) does not eliminate acrylic acid, probably because of
the barrier of the cleavage of the MAH and MAO bonds. On the
other hand, the body of experimental evidences suggests that in
Ni(0) promoted CO2-olefin coupling reactions the metallacycle
structure (A) (Scheme 11) is a thermodynamic sink, as a nickela-
lactone was usually found to be the final product. A more recent
attempt to liberate acrylic acid from a nickelalactone was based
on the use of a basic phosphane, such as 1,2-bis(diphenylpho
sphino)methane (dppm). However, a molecular rearrangement
took place bearing the cleavage of PAC bonds and the formation
of stable acrylato-complexes [134]. Aresta and coworkers have first
modeled using DFT the reaction of ethene with CO2 over L2Ni and
shown that the formation of the acrylic acid occurs in three main
steps passing through the facile formation of the pentaatomic met-
allacycle ring, which is in a well of energy that prevents on Ni a
facile last step, i.e. the b-H shift. Moreover the elimination of
acrylic acid has also a barrier [117]. Later on, Buntine and cowork-
ers [135] have investigated the reactivity of Ni(cod)(DBU)2 using
DFT. The calculations showed again three main steps for the pro-
cess: exothermic formation (17.2 kJ/mol) of the five-membered
nickelacycle
by
oxidative
coupling;
endothermic
b-H
shift
(+21.3 kJ/mol)
resulting
in
a
nickel-hydrido-acrylate
species;
endergonic
reductive
elimination
of
acrylic
acid;
(see
also
Scheme 11). The three steps exhibited substantial energy barriers
(respectively: 121.8 kJ/mol; 147.4 kJ/mol; 104.1 kJ/mol), but in
the opinion of the authors, not so large that would prohibit the
overall catalytic process. Thermodynamic in addition to kinetic
constraints may also prevent the overall reaction from taking place
at a significant extent, in accordance with the solvation-corrected
Gibbs free energy of the coupling reaction in question, which
was calculated to be unfavorable by +42.7 kJ/mol [135]. In this
regard, it may be of interest to note that acrylic acid has been
reported to react with Ni(cod)2 (1 equiv) in the presence of
PCy3 (1 equiv) to give the nickela-lactone species Cy3PNi(CH2CH2-
C(O)O) [136].
The reductive elimination of acrylic acid from a hydrido-acrylate
metal complex closely resembles the previously discussed elimina-
tion of formic acid from hydrido-formate metal complexes LnM(H)
O2CH. In the latter case, the elimination process is facilitated by
using an appropriate shuttle of the formate anion (amine or
Group 1 metal cations). The use of K+(Na+) shuttle has been inves-
tigated by Limback [137,138] who has reported the first catalytic
(also limited to a few cycles) formation of CH2@CHCOOM (M = K,
Na) by using Ni(0) catalysts in presence of MOH (Scheme 11). A
variation to this approach has been proposed by using excess
Zn-powder to reduce Ni [139]. This process uses more than 2e
per mol of acrylic acid (considering the loss of Zn used in excess),
being less effective than the electrochemical generation of acry-
lates carried out in the 1993s [140]. The role of Lewis acids has
been also investigated [141,142], and the activity of Pd systems
has been explored [143].
Recent advances have opened new perspectives in this research
area. The topic of coupling ethene-CO2 has recently been faced fol-
lowing a new synthetic approach aimed at avoiding the contempo-
rary formation of MAH and MAO bonds and driving the system
toward the formation of a metallorganic species of the type
MCH2CH2CO2R,
which
easily
eliminates
the
acrylato
ester
CH2@CHACO2R via a b-H shift with generation of a MAH species.
With the use of a Pd catalyst it has been shown that the elimina-
tion of the acrylate ester is an easy reaction and the catalytic for-
mation of such ester was described, however limited to a few
cycles [144]. The correctness of such strategy is further supported
by a few recent results which describe the formation of methyl
acrylate by methylation of nickela-lactones with MeI [145,146].
The latter results merit attention as they confirm that alkyl esters
of acrylic acids can be released more easily than the corresponding
acids from nickela-lactones.
A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be
co-polymerized with olefins to afford polyesters (Eq. (39))? If one
considers the skeleton of the product (A) obtained by coupling an
olefin with CO2 (Scheme 11), under which circumstances would
it be possible to insert an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of
(A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on?
nCO2  nRCH@CHR ! ACHRACHRACOOnA
39
Such alternate insertion of olefin and CO2 has not been experi-
mentally documented so far. It is useful to recall that alkynes are
able to insert a second alkyne in the skeleton of the product of
oxidative coupling of CO2 and the alkyne (Scheme 12 and 18; vide
infra 3.1.4). The insertion does not give an ester linkage as it occurs
on the MAC bond rather than on the MAO bond. The product of
coupling is then eliminated as a pyrone. The coupling of the olefin
with CO2 is more difficult than the coupling of the alkyne. Such
reaction may have a large industrial interest and is worth investi-
gating also if it is foreseeable that a perfect alternate insertion will
not be easily reached, and the insertion of CO2 will be statistical
and will not reach the level of insertion of CO as in the case of
ethene/CO.
3.1.2. Synthesis of other carboxylic acids by oxidative coupling CO2 and
olefins
The formation of a terminal carboxylic moiety CACO2 is
achieved through a variety of routes such as oxidation of hydrocar-
bons or aldehydes (obtained from olefins by hydroformylation),
base catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols, carbonylation reac-
tions often coupled with H2O addition (Koch reaction; Reppe
chemistry), oxidative cleavage of olefins by ozonolysis or using
H2O2
or
even
O2,

acid- or base-catalysis, carbonation of a Grignard or organolithium
reagents. In some cases the synthetic methods are poorly selective
or not quantitative, and in other cases they may imply multistep
procedures with production of wastes and loss of carbon [116].
In this ambit the development of direct catalytic carboxylation of
organic substrates would be of great value and applicative interest.
As previously noted, unsaturated substrates such as olefins,
alkynes, [54,73,105,106,109,110,147,148] allenes [106,149] and
conjugated dienes [73,105,106,118,119,150155] can react with
CO2 in the presence of a suitable metal center in a low oxidation
state through an oxidative coupling reaction, which provides an
entry into a variety of metal-carboxylated species. Although most
of such reactions at the moment are stoichiometric, they can play
a significant role from the synthetic point of view as they are direct
and clean routes to functionalized unsaturated carboxylic acids or
alkyl esters, which can be released stoichiometrically upon simple
protonolysis or acidolysis in the presence of alcohols.
3.1.2.1. Functionalization of alkynes, allenes and conjugated dienes.
Ni(0) is very effective in promoting the oxidative coupling of alkynes
or allenes with CO2. Scheme 12 shows the formation of carboxylic
acids produced by hydrolysis of the metallacycle. Such route uses
catalysis for the coupling of the unsaturated substrate with CO2,
but the metallacycle does not undergo spontaneous elimination,
as already seen with acrylates. Acidolysis is necessary for recover-
ing the carboxylic acid. Such syntheses have been achieved in the
1993s by electrocatalysis [156,157], which again is not catalytic
as sacrificial electrodes were used and the carboxylated product
was recovered as Mg-salt, in general. Making such processes cat-
alytic would be of great importance.
Stoichiometric carboxylation of conjugated dienes with CO2 has
been carried out in the presence of both late and early transition
metal complexes. Depending on the nature of the metal center,
ancillary ligands, diene substrate, and, more generally, working
conditions, the carboxylation reaction may evolve in different ways
and afford metal-carboxylic products implying 1:2 or 1:1 or 2:1
CO2/1,3-diene coupling, which are useful synthones for further
reactions with electrophiles. For instance, in the presence of mon-
odentate P-ligands, Ni(0) promotes the CO2/1,3-diene coupling in a
1:2 ratio to yield a Ni(II)-C9-carboxylate.
This behavior reflects the well recognized ability of Ni(0)-
complexes bearing labile phosphane ligands to promote olefin
oligomerization. In thes carboxylation reactions the dimerization
of the diene to form a bis-allyl-C8 chain is followed by CO2 inser-
tion into a Ni-allyl r-bond to afford Ni(II)-carboxylates, which
may undergo further rearrangement reactions. CO2/diene coupling
in
a
1:1
ratio
to
give g3-allyl-C5-carboxylate
Ni-complexes
(Scheme 12) has been shown to be promoted in the presence of
P- or N-chelating ligands [106,154]. Although g3-coordination of
the allyl moiety is thermodynamically more stable compared to
the g1-bonding mode, an g3g1 rearrangement of the oxo-p-
allyl intermediate formed by diene-CO2 oxidative coupling is also
possible and can be envisaged to account for the formation of a,
x-dicarboxylate complexes, which have been reported in a few
cases (Scheme 12; M = Fe [151], Zr [152], Ni [153]). Remarkably,
only 1,4- and no 1,2-dicarboxylation have been observed. More
recently, this stoichiometric chemistry has received new impulse
[158160] and has, for instance, been applied to the synthesis of
highly functionalized carboxylic acids, such as a-methylene-c-hydr
oxy carboxylic acids [158] and their derivatives, or exploited for
the preparation of b-hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives [159].
The synthetic valence of the reactions described above is out of
discussion, but their stoichiometric character may represent a lim-
itation to their exploitation. The moment being they can be applied
on a small scale or for the synthesis of high added value chemicals
of complex structure. The stoichiometric nature of these processes

can be related with the thermodynamic and/or kinetic stability of
metalla-lactones or Cn-carboxylate metal-complexes intermediate
products as discussed above (Scheme 12).
Driving catalytically the carboxylation of the above substrates is
not an easy task. This goal may be achieved through a judicious
choice of the metal center, the ancillary ligands and the experi-
mental conditions. For instance, in the presence of Ni(0), switching
from PPh3 to less basic P(O-i-Pr)3 ancillary ligand allowed to obtain
2-methylene-3-vinylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid from butadiene
and CO2 even catalytically, albeit in low yield and with a low turn-
over (TON = 29) [153]. Unfortunately, to date, this remains a rare
example of such an approach.
Nowadays, new synthetic strategies have given new impulse to
the research in this area opening new perspectives in the use of the
heterocumulene as carboxylating agent of unsaturated organic
substrates. These approaches exploit the reactivity of a suitable
co-reagent able to reduce back the catalyst from Ni(II) to Ni(0).
At the end the catalytic center can be recycled, but a reduced form
of a metal (Zn, Al) is oxidized. Such approach may have sense if the
catalyst is a precious metal, less with Ni. The fact that another
metal is in any case oxidized in stoichiometric amount leaves
doubts about the correctness of using the term catalytic in such
applications, and leaves on such reaction the label of trans
metalations or syntheses assisted by metals.
Alkyl- or aryl-zinc reagents, acting as alkylating(arylating)/trans
metalating agents, have been used to push catalytically (in the
sense
discussed
above)
the
carboxylation
of
alkynes
[161]
(Scheme 13) or bis 1,3-dienes [162,163] in the presence of Ni(0).
The unsaturated carboxylic acids can be liberated from the
relevant Zn carboxylated salt by protonolysis.
According to a different approach organozinc reagents have
been used as reducing/transmetalating agents for addressing
catalytically the carboxylation of unsaturates, such as styrenes
(Scheme 14) [164] or internal alkynes [165], in the presence of
Ni(0) catalysts, through a hydrocarboxylative pathway which
allows
to
bypass
the
formation
of
a
classic
Hoberg-
type
oxanickelacycle.
Such hydrocarboxylative approach has been successfully applied
to the carboxylation of internal alkynes by using Cu catalysts and
hydrosilanes as hydride transfer agents [166], and for the synthesis
of b,c-unsaturated carboxylic acids from allenes [167,168] or
1,3-dienes [169] and CO2. A new hydrocarboxylating system has
been used, based on a tridentate silyl pincer palladium catalyst
precursor (X = trifluoromethanesulfonate in Scheme 15) and AlEt3
(or ZnEt2).
A mild and user-friendly Ni-catalyzed regioselective hydrocar-
boxylation of alkynes with CO2 (0.1 MPa) has been also described
which uses Mn as reducing agent and simple alcohols as proton
sources [170].
A common feature of the carboxylation reactions discussed
above is the utilization of a coreactant (ZnR2, HSiR3, AlR3, etc.; usu-
ally used in excess with respect to the unsaturated substrate),
which is consumed to regenerate the catalytically active species
(LnNi(0); LnMAH) after each cycle. Therefore, as already discussed
above, all these processes are catalytic with respect to the transi-
tion metal (Ni, Cu, Pd, etc.), but not with respect to the co-
reagent, which is used in excess and generates waste at the end
of the process. Features like the energetic cost of the species used
in transmetalation (metal alkyls are quite intensive in energy) and
the metal waste generated in the final step of acidolysis, contribute
to increasing the E-factor and decreasing the environmental sus-
tainability of these syntheses. Nevertheless these reactions provide
a powerful versatile tool for the direct synthesis of complex
organic molecules functionalized with carboxylic acid moieties,
which, otherwise, would be produced through multistep proce-
dures. Further progresses in this area are expected through the def-
inition of cheaper and cleaner reducing agents and enlarging the
portfolio of used unsaturated substrates. LCA should be used for

key issues in the reaction so to find a remedy and make such inter-
esting reactive systems suitable for the direct carboxylation of
organic substrates.
3.1.3. Carboxylic acids by CO2 incorporation into C-H bonds
The direct CH carboxylation with CO2 provides another poten-
tial route to carboxylic acids (Eq. (40)). The process formally
involves the insertion of CO2 into a CAH bond. The enthalpy of such
a reaction can be easily calculated as it is given by the following
quantities: DHr = [H(CAC) + H(OAH)]  H(CAH).
For
different
sub-
strates major differences can be found in the values of H(CAH) and
minor for H(CAC). The entropic content of the reaction is due mainly
to the fact that gaseous CO2 is at the end found in a liquid or solid
form. The DS will be negative so that the term TDS will be posi-
tive. The DG will depend mainly on the entropic content and the
overall reaction will have a positive Gibbs free energy change,
making the concentration of the acid quite low at the equilibrium.
The carboxylation of methane or benzene (Eqs. (41) and (42))
exemplifies the situation at 298 K.

Various metallorganic reagents, usually obtained by the direct
metalation of a CAH bond (as well as by reacting an organic halide
with a metal compound), have been used for a stoichiometric
carboxylation of organic substrates [171,172]. Also phenoxide
anion (C6H5O) g5-coordinated to transition metal centers, such
as Mn(II) [173] or Rh(I) [174], has been shown to selectively
activate the para-CAH bond of the aromatic ring and, upon CO2
fixation, convert into the 4-OH-benzoic acid. Such carboxylation
reactions are reminiscent of the for long time known carboxylation
of Grignards reagents and are stoichiometric processes as they
require 1 mol of metal per mol of organic product and should be
regarded
as
metal-assisted
carboxylations.
This
feature
represents a limitation making unlikely the application of these
processes on a large scale.
Catalytic carboxylation of CAH bonds has been claimed to occur
in presence of an active CAH bond. However, 2-dialkyl-imidazo
lium-carboxylates bearing CO2 bonded at the heterocarbene moi-
ety have been shown to be able to act as CO2-carrier and transfer
CO2 to activated CAH bonds (Eq. (43)) [175]. The catalytic carboxy-
lation of CAH bonds of heteroaromatics HetH has been carried out
in presence of the system [(IPr)AuOH]/KOH (IPr = (1,3-bis(diisopro
pyl)-phenylimidazol-2-ylidene) (Scheme 16) [176].

Regeneration of the [(IPr)AuOH] catalyst from the intermediate
gold carboxylate [(IPr)Au(O2CHet)] is accomplished by K+ cation
acting as a shuttle of the carboxylate moiety. NHCCu complexes
have also been used [177,178]. When common aromatic com-
pounds (benzene derivatives) are used, the carboxylation occurs
quite efficiently only if electron deficient groups are present in
the ring, indicating that the CAH bond must be strongly activated
(acidic CAH bonds) in order that the carboxylation may occur
[179].
Therefore, the acidity of the CAH bond of the substrate repre-
sents a limitation in these processes, although it can be modulated
by controlling the substituents in the organic substrate. However,
this constrain may limit the number of potentially usable sub-
strates which can afford carboxylated products that may not be
of general use.
In principle, the interaction of the substrate with a suitable ac-
tivating system, such as a metal system, may provide another way
to enhance the activity of a CAH moiety. This approach is by far
more appealing as it can lead to several products of industrial
use. Such direct functionalization might be very useful with short
chain HCs (C1AC4) that do not find a convenient use today.
Recently, direct carboxylation of simple arenes under atmospheric
pressure of CO2 has been achieved through a rhodium-catalyzed
CAH bond activation without the assistance of a directing group,

using AlMe2(OMe) [180] or AlMe1.5(OEt)1.5 [181] as reductant. Var-
ious arenes such as benzene, toluene, xylene, electron-rich or
electron-deficient benzene derivatives, and heteroaromatics have
been directly carboxylated with high TONs [181]. Also in this case
the catalytic center (Rh) is regenerated at expenses of Al, another
less expensive and more common metal, but the E-factor of such
synthesis is quite high making it suitable for limited applications.
Photocatalysis may offer interesting perspectives in this area.
Recently, the direct insertion of CO2 into the CAH bond of acacH
(actylacetone) has been shown to occur under photocatalysis
(Scheme 17) [182]. The species identified as the initiator of the
reaction is the CO2
. radical anion. It extracts a H-atom either from
the enolic form or from acacH itself. Coupling of COOH with the
acac-radical affords the acid. Interestingly, under photocatalysis
two different isomeric acids are obtained that imply the CO2 inser-
tion into the activated methylenic CAH bond but also into the
more inert CAH bond of the terminal ACH3 moiety, that under
chemical catalysis is not affected [183].
Such approach has been used also for the photocarboxylation of
2,3-dihydrofuran (2,3-DHF) to afford 25% yields 2,3-DHF-2-COOH
[184]. Noteworthy, the photocatalytic approach works in water
and affords the free acid and not the salts as seen in other cases
above. This feature makes the photocatalytic approach of great
interest.
To date, catalytic carboxylation of CH bonds still remains a chal-
lenging research area, which deserves more research efforts. The
only industrial exploitation of reaction (40) is still provided by
the KolbeSchmitt synthesis of hydroxybenzoic acids [185] carried
out by reacting CO2 with Group 1 salts of phenol under severe con-
ditions. Noteworthy, also this industrial synthesis is not a catalytic
process as 1 mol of Group 1 metal (Na or K) is used per mol of phe-
nol. It would be interesting to convert it into a catalytic process
using phenol more than phenolates. The direct carboxylation reac-
tions are of great importance, and their exploitation may have
favorable impact on the chemical industry allowing the synthesis
of several large market products (for instance, acetic acid, benzoic
acid, long chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids) through less tortu-
ous and more C-efficient routes.
3.1.4. Synthesis of linear and cyclic esters from unsaturated
hydrocarbons
Under suitable conditions, CO2 and unsaturated organic sub-
strates (alkynes, allenes, conjugated dienes and others) can be
cooligomerized catalytically. These processes open new perspec-
tives in the synthesis of industrially relevant classes of compounds,
such as cyclic and linear esters, by direct reaction of CO2 and unsat-
urated substrates. Nevertheless, so far, these transformations have
not been widely developed and in most cases are still far from
exploitation.
3.1.4.1.
Catalytic
cooligomerization
of
alkynes
and
CO2. The
cooligomerization of CO2 with internal or terminal alkynes affords
2-pyrones. This reaction is effectively promoted by phosphine-Ni
(0) complexes as catalysts (Scheme 18) [108,186189]. Ni(0)/
NHC (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) systems have been also
developed for the synthesis of pyrones from CO2 and diynes under
mild
conditions
(room
temperature,
0.1 MPa
CO2
pressure)
[190,191]. 2-Pyrones are used in organic synthesis and medicinal
chemistry as a building block for more complex chemical struc-
tures because they may participate in cycloaddition reactions to
form bicyclic lactones. Moreover, 2-pyrone structure is found in
numerous natural products isolated from plants, animals, marine
organisms, bacteria, fungi, and insects that exhibit a broad range
of biological activities, such as antifungal, antibiotic, cytotoxic,
neurotoxic and phytotoxic. A variety of synthetic methodologies
of 2-pyrones have been developed and have been recently
reviewed [192].
Scheme 18 summarizes the generally accepted mechanism of
the Ni-catalyzed formation of pyrone.
The first step of the catalytic cycle is the formation of oxanick-
elacyclopentenone A, as already discussed. This intermediate can
insert another alkyne molecule into the NiAC(sp2) bond to afford
the oxa-nickel-acyclo-heptadienone B, from which the pyrone pro-
duct is liberated by reductive elimination. Dedicated studies have
ruled out the hypothesis that pyrone formation might imply the
preliminary coupling of two alkyne molecules to form a nickelacy-
clopentadiene complex, followed by CO2 insertion into the NiAC
bond or [4 + 2] cycloaddition to a CO2 molecule. On the contrary,
nickelacyclopentadiene species are involved as intermediates only
in the undesired side-reaction of alkyne cyclotrimerization. In this
area Ni-based systems still continue to be among the most effec-
tive catalysts. Other metal catalysts (Co [193] and Rh [194] com-
plexes) are less active and less selective because of collateral
substrate cyclo-oligomerization. Heterogeneous catalysts have

3.1.4.2. Catalytic cooligomerization of allenes and CO2. Also allenes,
CO2-like molecules, can be cooligomerized with CO2 in the pres-
ence of transition metal (Pd, Rh, Ni) catalysts [196200]. To date,
this topic has received only moderate attention. Yields in carboxy-
lated products are generally low to modest because of significant
incidence of the undesired oligo- and polymerization of the
substrate.
The reaction of allene with CO2 in the presence of Pd [196] or Rh
[197] catalysts yields linear and cyclic esters (AC; Scheme 19). An

unprecedented reaction has been observed by reacting allene with
carbon dioxide in the presence of trans-[RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2 as
catalyst and controlled amounts of H2, used to repress the allene
head-to-tail polymerization side-reaction [200]. In fact, under
strictly controlled experimental conditions, [RhCl(C2H4)P(i-Pr)3]2
promoted, albeit in low yield, the formation of four-membered lac-
tone 3-methylene-2-oxetanone (D, Scheme 19), which is the pro-
duct of formal [2 + 2] addition of allene to CO2 [201]. This
product has never been observed when allene is reacted with
CO2 in absence of H2. Such four membered systems are usually
obtained by converting acrylates with singlet O2 in the presence
of PPh3 as acceptor of unrequired oxygen [202]. The synthesis of
the four membered lactone by direct reaction of allene and CO2
is noteworthy and remains a unique evidence of coupling to afford
the isomeric form of ketene.
