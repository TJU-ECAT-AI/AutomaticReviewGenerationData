1. Comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques to elucidate their structural, chemical, and morphological properties at atomic and nanoscale levels.

The comprehensive characterization and comparison of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts using advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques have provided crucial insights into their structural, chemical, and morphological properties at atomic and nanoscale levels. These techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural Properties: In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments reveal the structural information of both catalysts under reaction conditions, showing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. The XRD patterns also demonstrate the reversible structural evolution of the catalysts under different gas environments and temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

2. Oxidation States: In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy determines the valence states of Ni and Fe. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0, while Fe sites exhibit features between FeO and Fe3O4, closer to Fe3O4 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_2]. XANES spectra at the Fe K-edge indicate that Fe is present as a mixture of Fe0 and Fe2+ species in both catalysts, with a higher proportion of Fe0 in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

3. Local Coordination and Particle Size: Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results provide information on coordination numbers and bond lengths. The analysis reveals that metallic NiFe alloy particles have diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm in both catalysts [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. EXAFS analysis at the Fe K-edge shows higher Fe-Fe coordination numbers in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggesting larger Fe-rich particles [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. Spatial Distribution and Morphology: Ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of different elements [10.1073/pnas.1806950115]. This technique reveals distinct differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2, with the former showing CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, which is absent in the latter [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_2].

5. Dynamic Behavior: In situ XANES measurements during CO2 hydrogenation show dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state, with partial oxidation occurring under reaction conditions [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

Key differences and implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. The presence of a 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer on CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, which is absent in Fe1Ni3/CeO2, leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites. These sites are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective C-H bond cleavage to produce ethylene) [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].

2. The absence of the FeOx layer in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 results in the dominance of NiCeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient C-C bond scission to produce synthesis gas) [10.1073/pnas.1806950115].

3. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has a higher proportion of Fe0 and larger Fe-rich particles compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which could affect catalytic activity and selectivity [10.1021/acscatal.6b02991.s001].

4. The differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 suggest that the Fe:Ni ratio affects the overall catalyst structure, which may lead to different catalytic behaviors [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_2].

5. The nanoscale dimensions of the metallic particles (2.5-4.0 nm) highlight the importance of controlling particle size for optimal catalyst performance [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_2].

These findings demonstrate that the ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different interfacial sites, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions. This comprehensive understanding of the catalysts' characteristics allows for more targeted and effective catalyst design strategies for specific applications.
