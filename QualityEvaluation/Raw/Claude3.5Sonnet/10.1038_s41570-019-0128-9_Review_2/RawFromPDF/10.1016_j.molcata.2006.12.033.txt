Abstract
Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts modiﬁed with Ni, Fe, Co, Mn oxides respectively were synthesized by coupling co-precipitation with
azeotropic distillation method. The effect of modiﬁers on the catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 was investigated. The
modiﬁers exhibited different effects on catalytic behavior. Fe, Co and Mn oxides markedly increased ethylene selectivity, but the Ni5-Cr10/Zr
nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the reforming and cracking reactions. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited
an excellent performance in this reaction, producing 50.05% ethylene yield at 53.72% ethane conversion at 650 ◦C. The modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-
composite catalysts were characterized by BET, TEM, XRD, XPS, CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD techniques. The characterization indicated that weak
acid sites are involved in ethane activation, and strong acid–base pairs promote the reforming and cracking reactions. The distribution of chromium
species, oxygen species and base/acid property on the surface of catalyst cooperatively determined the catalytic activity in dehydrogenations of
ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant.

1. Introduction
Carbon dioxide is one of the major greenhouse gases. The
utilization of carbon dioxide has attracted an intensive atten-
tion in academia and industry. Recently several attempts have
been made to utilize carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant for dehy-
drogenation of ethane to yield ethylene because of the growing
requirement for alkenes [1–10]. This process provides several
advantages, which had been demonstrated by many researchers
[1,6,7], such as a lower reaction temperature and less cata-
lyst deactivation due to coking. Furthermore, syn-gas can be
obtained as a by-product of this process. Up to now, Fe-Mn/Si-2
[1], La2O3/-Al2O3 [2], Mo2C/SiO2 [4], Cr/H-ZSM-5 [5], K-
Cr-Mn/SiO2 [6], Cr/SiO2 [7], Ga/TiO2 [8], CeO2-based [9] and
metal oxides [10] catalysts have been used in the dehydrogena-
tion of ethane with CO2 as an oxidant. Among these catalysts,

chromium-based catalysts have proven to be the most effective
catalysts for this reaction [5–7]. In order to obtain better cat-
alytic activity, some efforts had been focused on the supports of
chromium-based catalysts using TS-1 [11] and MSU-x [12].
In the past decade, nano-particles (especially, oxides)
attracted much attention in the ﬁeld of heterogeneous catal-
ysis due to their unique physical and chemical properties.
Many efforts were devoted to prepare nano-particle catalysts
and a number of interesting results were obtained for differ-
ent catalytic reactions [13–15]. Compared to other Cr2O3-based
nano-composite catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane to ethylene with CO2, the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite
catalysts showed high catalytic activity with low selectivity to
ethylene in our prior research [15]. The objective of this work
is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydro-
genationofethanewithCO2 ontheCr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite
catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides. Chemi-
cal and structural properties of these catalysts were characterized
and these results were used to establish a correlation with their
catalytic activity.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts were
prepared by coupling co-precipitation with the azeotropic dis-
tillation method. Mixed solution of CrCl3, FeCl3, and ZrOCl2
and diluted NH3·H2O solution were simultaneously added drop-
wise into a diluted NH3·H2O solution (pH ≈10) at 40 ◦C with
stirring. The precipitates were ﬁltered and washed with deion-
ized water until no Cl−was detected using a 0.1 M AgNO3
solution, then n-butyl alcohol was added to remove residual
water from the precipitates with azeotropic distillation. After
vacuum-drying at 80 ◦C for 8 h and calcination at 600 ◦C in air
for 2.5 h, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite was prepared. The
nano-particles of Fe5-Cr10/Zr were pressed, crushed and sieved
into catalysts of 20–40 mesh. The Mn5-Cr10/Zr, Ni5-Cr10/Zr and
Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts were prepared using a
similar method.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
BET surface area, pore size and pore volumes of the samples
were determined using N2 adsorption method on an Autosorb-
1 physisorb analyzer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the
catalysts were obtained on a Rigaku D/max-2400 X-ray diffrac-
tometer at 40 kV and 120 mA; using Ni ﬁltered K radiation
from a Cu target. The size of the nano-particles was determined
using a HITACHI H-8100 TEM. XPS measurements were car-
ried out on a PHI 5300/ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer) with Al
K as a radiation source. Data were acquired at 25 mA under
the vacuum of 2.9 × 10−7 Pa.
NH3- and CO2-TPD tests were performed using a Chembet-
3000 chemisorb analyzer. The catalysts (0.1 g) were treated at
400 ◦C for 4 h in a helium ﬂow of 30 ml/min. The pretreated sam-
ples were saturated with a NH3 or CO2 ﬂow (15 ml/min) at room
temperature for 1 h. The samples were ﬂushed with Ar ﬂowing
at 20 ml/min for 30 min; then the temperature was increased to
1000 ◦C at a heating rate of 18 ◦C/min. Gases desorbed were
monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The
amounts of basic/acidic sites on the surface of the catalyst were
estimated by the desorption quantities of CO2/NH3, which was
determined by the areas of the desorption proﬁles.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow type
quartz reactor packed with 200 mg of the catalyst and 1 g of
quartzsandatatmosphericpressure.Thereactantstreamconsist-
ing of 20% ethane, 60% carbon dioxide and 20% Ar was intro-
duced into the reactor at a ﬂow rate of 15 ml/min. The reaction
temperature ranged between 550 and 650 ◦C. The products were
analyzed on line by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC 14B)
with a Porapak QS column and a 5 A molecular sieve column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance
CO, H2, CH4 and water were detected in addition to ethylene
in the catalytic tests. Based on this result and other proposed

The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation
of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with
CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogena-
tion reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction
(2). The reforming reaction (4) and hydrocracking of ethane (5)
were side reactions. Table 1 presents the catalytic conversions
and selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenations of ethane with
CO2 to ethylene over modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalysts at various temperatures. Catalytic
conversion increased and ethylene selectivity decreased with
elevation of reaction temperature. The ethylene selectivity of
the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite
catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-
compositecatalyst,whiletheirethaneandCO2 conversionswere
lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst.
Inversely, the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst showed the
highest ethane and CO2 conversions, much higher than even the
Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while it demonstrated the
lowest selectivity to ethylene among the prepared catalysts. The
high yield of CO and high selectivity to methane indicated that
the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst favored the reform-
ing reaction (4) and the cracking reaction (5). The Fe5-Cr10/Zr,
Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts did not
favor the reforming reaction, especially below 600 ◦C. Among
the prepared catalysts, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst
exhibited not only high ethylene selectivity, but also relatively
high ethane and CO2 conversions. At 650 ◦C, the Fe5-Cr10/Zr
nano-composite catalyst demonstrated 93.17% ethylene selec-
tivity and 53.72% ethane conversion.
3.2. Textural and structural properties
BET surface area, average pore size and pore volumes of vari-
ous Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites are given in Table 2. The pore
volumes of modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites signiﬁcantly
increased, and were almost double value of the Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composites. Compared with the variation of pore volume,
the surface area of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite changed
little with the addition of modiﬁers. The average pore sizes
of the modiﬁed nano-composites were larger than that of the
Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite.
The XRD patterns of modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites
are presented in Fig. 1. Only tetragonal ZrO2 can be observed
in the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-
composites, which mean that the Fe, Mn and Co oxides did not
change the crystal structure of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite

[15]. Monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 coexisted in the Ni5-
Cr10/Zr nano-composite, while tetragonal ZrO2 was the major
phase. This suggests that addition of Ni oxide induced the
phase transformation of tetragonal ZrO2 to monoclinic ZrO2.
According to Bachiller-Baeza and Jung [16,17], the monoclinic
structure of ZrO2 brings about stronger surface adsorption sites
for CO2 than the tetragonal structure. In this investigation, only
the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite exhibited monoclinic ZrO2
among these catalysts, so there were more activity sites that can
adsorb and activate CO2 on its surface than other catalysts. This
result was conﬁrmed by XPS and CO2-TPD characterization
(Figs. 4 and 6). As expected, the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite
catalyst showed the highest CO2 conversions in the catalytic
performance experiment. No diffraction peaks of Cr2O3 and
modiﬁers were observed on the XRD spectra of modiﬁed and
unmodiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites, probably due to their
lower intensities or highly dispersed in the composites.
The TEM images of the modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-
composites (Fig. 2) show that the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr,
Ni5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composites were regularly
spherical in shape, and the size distribution of these nano-
particles was very narrow. Nevertheless, the relatively good
agreement between BET surface area and the particle size from
TEM images indicated that single crystalline particles of all
these samples were separable. Few solid agglomerates were
observed for the Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite (Fig. 2d), which
explains why its surface area was the smallest among these
nano-composites (Table 2).

spectra of Cr 2p on all catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Two peaks
occurred for Cr 2p3/2 spectra on all catalysts: one at ∼576 eV
and the other at ∼579 eV. Those two species can be assigned to
Cr3+ and Cr6+, respectively [7]. The binding energy (BE) values
of Cr 2p3/2 peaks were obtained by applying a peak-ﬁtting pro-
gram and given in Table 2. The binding energies (BE) for Cr3+
and Cr6+ on all catalysts were very similar, respectively. The
addition of modiﬁers increased the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of modi-
ﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts, and the Fe5-Cr10/Zr
nano-composite catalyst showed the greatest Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio.
Some researches indicate that the active species for dehydro-
genation on Cr2O3-based catalysts are Cr3+ or/and Cr2+ ions
[18,19]. In recent years, Wang et al. [7] investigated the dehy-
drogenation of ethane with CO2 over supported chromium oxide
catalysts and proposed that surface Cr3+ species and Cr6+/Cr3+
couples are the active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane. Ge
et al. [20] used ESR and UV-DRS to probe the active site for
the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 over silica-supported
chromium oxide catalysts, and found that species with high valet
states(Cr5+ orCr6+)areimportantforthereaction.Inthisinvesti-
gation, it was found that two Cr species, Cr3+ and Cr6+, coexisted
on the surface of modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite cata-

lysts, and the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios on the catalysts were different.
The ratio of Cr6+/Cr3+ affects the acidity and/or reducibility of
catalyst [21,22]. Therefore, these modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-
composite catalysts exhibited very different catalytic activity.
Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of O 1s on modiﬁed and unmod-
iﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts. The Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalyst displayed one wide and unsymmetri-
cal peak, suggesting the presence of two kinds of oxygen species
with different chemical environments on its surface. The peak at
lower binding energy (near 529.5 eV) can be assigned to surface
lattice oxygen O2−(hereafter denoted as OI). The other peak
at higher binding energy (near 531.0 eV) has been attributed to
carbonates or adsorbed CO2 (hereafter denoted as OII) [23–25].
From the XPS spectra of C 1s over the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-
composite catalyst, a C 1s peak at 288.2 eV can be observed
in addition to the C 1s peak of hydrocarbon contaminant carbon
at 284.6 eV. Since the C 1s peak at 288.2 eV is due to carbonate
species [26,27], the O 1s peak near 531.0 eV demonstrates the
formation of some activity sites that can adsorb and activate CO2
on the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst surface.
The O 1s peaks of modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite
catalysts were wider than the corresponding peak of the Cr2O3/

ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, and shoulder peaks were visible
on their spectra (Fig. 4). These imply the formation of a new
type of surface oxygen species. The binding energy (BE) values
of O 1s peaks obtained by a ﬁtting program are listed in Table 3.
The new type of surface oxygen species (near 532 eV) has been
reported to be adsorbed oxygen species (O−, O22−) (hereafter
denoted as OIII) [24,28]. When Fe cations are doped into the
crystal Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite replacing some Zr4+, Cr3+
or Cr6+ cations, unbalanced charges and lattice distortion occur
ontheFe5-Cr10/Zrnano-compositesurface.Consequently,some
oxygen vacancies probably present, which will be relinquished
via adsorbing oxygen from environment [29,30]. Therefore,
there were more adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) on the sur-
face of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite than the Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalyst. Absorbed oxygen species (OIII) also
exited on the Ni5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-
composites catalysts surface for the same reason.
The lattice oxygen species (OI) are mainly responsible
for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, and adsorbed oxy-
gen species (OIII) are involved in deep oxidation, leading to
COx product formation [24,26]. However, other researches have
shown that adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) may also partic-
ipate in selective reaction steps on the catalytic surface of
several metal oxides [27]. Our research indicated that propor-
tions of lattice oxygen (OI), oxygen species in adsorbed CO2
(OII) and adsorbed oxygen (OIII) on surfaces of all Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalysts were very different (Table 3). The
Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited the highest pro-
portion of oxygen species in adsorbed CO2 (OII) among
modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts, even more than
the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, which means there
were the most activity sites for CO2 on its surface. Therefore, the
Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited the highest CO2
conversion in the catalytic performance experiment. Comparing
with the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, the proportion
of adsorbed oxygen (OIII) on the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr
and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts surface increased,
and the proportion of oxygen species in adsorbed CO2 (OII)
decreased. The catalytic performance experiment indicated that
their ethylene selectivity increased remarkably, while their CO2
and ethane conversion decreased, demonstrating that adsorbed
oxygen species (OIII) are prone to reduce the reforming reac-
tion. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst exhibited not
only the highest ethylene selectivity, but also high ethane and
CO2 conversion. These phenomena indicate that lattice oxy-
gen (OI), adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) and oxygen species
in adsorbed CO2 (OII) play important roles in oxidative dehy-
drogenations of ethane with CO2 to ethylene. The catalyst can
exhibit good catalytic reaction activity if the proportion of
these three kinds of oxygen species the on catalyst surface is
proper.
3.4. Acid and base characteristics
It is generally believed that acid/base property is impor-
tant factor in inﬂuencing catalytic activity. Acid–base pairs are
important for hydrocarbon activation. CO2 and NH3 tempera-

properties of solids. The NH3- and CO2-TPD proﬁles for the
Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, Co5-Cr10/Zr, and Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-
composite catalysts are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.
The results show that acidic and basic sites coexist on the sur-
face of all catalysts. The modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite
catalysts presented varying NH3- and CO2-TPD patterns, sug-
gesting different numbers and strength of acid/base sites on
their surfaces. Many peaks can be observed on the NH3- and
CO2-TPD proﬁles of the modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite
catalysts in the whole experimental region, from 50 to 1000 ◦C,
which indicate the presence of many kinds of acid/base sites on
their surfaces. The low-temperature desorption peak represents
weak acid/base sites and the high-temperature desorption peak
corresponds to strong acid/base sites on catalyst surface.
For the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, a very large
NH3-desorption peak appeared from 450 to 600 ◦C (Fig. 5),
indicating a large number of strong acid sites on its surface. The
number of strong acid sites on the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr
and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts were much smaller
than that of the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, because
their desorption peaks at temperatures between 450 and 600 ◦C
were much smaller than that of the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite
catalyst. In the catalytic experiment, the ethylene selectivity of
the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite
catalysts were markedly higher than that of the Ni5-Cr10/Zr
nano-composite catalyst, which mainly favored the reforming
and cracking reactions. It can be concluded that the strong acid
sites promote the reforming and cracking reactions, and affect
ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
with CO2.
The Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-
composite catalysts showed different area peaks at temperatures
between 100 and 200 ◦C, meaning there were different numbers
of weak acid sites on their surfaces, and these catalysts exhibited
different reactant conversion. The order of ethane conversion of
these catalysts was Co5-Cr10/Zr > Fe5-Cr10/Zr > Mn5-Cr10/Zr,
which agreed with the order of the number of weak acid sites on
their surfaces. So, it can be deduced that the weak acid sites are
involved in ethane activation.
Fig. 6 indicates that the total area of CO2 desorption peaks
of the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst was the largest,
which means there were more sites available for CO2 absorption
on its surface. This result was consistent with the XPS result.
Except for the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, there were
no weak base sites on other Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite cata-
lysts, induced by the absence of peaks on their CO2-TPD proﬁles
at temperatures between 100 and 250 ◦C.
Although all Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts pre-
sented varying CO2-TPD patterns, a large peak occurred on
every CO2-TPD proﬁles between 450 and 650 ◦C. This implies
the presence of strong base sites on their surfaces. The peak of
the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst was the highest, which
means the number of strong base sites was the greatest. After
addition of Fe, Mn, and Co oxides, the peak of Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalysts at the temperatures between 450 and
650 ◦C decreased; however, the ethylene selectivity of the
Fe5-Cr10/Zr,Mn5-Cr10/ZrandCo5-Cr10/Zrnano-compositecat-
alysts increased in the catalytic activity experiment. So strong
base sites decrease the ethylene selectivity, and strong acid–base
pairs beneﬁt the side reaction—the reforming and cracking reac-
tions. These results clearly illustrate that the catalyst acid/base
property also plays an important role in the oxidative dehydro-
genation of ethane with CO2. In combination with the XPS
results, it can be concluded that the distribution of chromium
species, oxygen species and base/acid property on the surface of
catalyst cooperatively determined the catalytic activity of modi-
ﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenations
of ethane to ethylene using CO2 as an oxidant.
4. Conclusion
This investigation clearly shows that modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalysts exhibited varying activities in dehy-
drogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The modiﬁers of Fe,
Co and Mn oxides markedly increased the ethylene selectivity of
the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while the Ni5-Cr10/Zr
nano-composite catalyst mainly favored side reactions—the
reforming and cracking reactions. Based on the ethylene yield,
the catalytic activity of modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite
catalysts at 650 ◦C followed the order of Fe5-Cr10/Zr > Mn5-
Cr10/Zr > Co5-Cr10/Zr > Ni5-Cr10/Zr. The nature of the modiﬁer
exerted an inﬂuence upon the textural and structural property of
catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species,
and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn

determined the catalytic activity of the modiﬁed Cr2O3/ZrO2
nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with
carbon dioxide.
