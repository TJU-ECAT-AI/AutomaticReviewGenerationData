[1] "In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."

[2] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor"

[3] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm"

[4] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."

[5] "As shown in Fig. 4, Ni species tended to form particles, agreeing with both in situ XRD and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results. Fe species were found on those Ni particles, suggesting the formation of NiFe alloy as revealed by the XRD and XAS data or the formation of amorphous FeOx at the surface of Ni (or NiFe alloy) particles as stated in the literature"

[6] "A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17). To further verify this conclusion, EELS line-scan analysis of Fe species was conducted on the two samples. Fig. 4F shows the typical EELS line-scan profiles of Fe species over CeO2 particles for both samples. The profiles indicated the presence of a thin layer of FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while such a layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in the following ways:

1. In situ XRD provides structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure on both catalysts.

2. In situ XANES spectroscopy determines the valence state of Ni and Fe, showing that Ni is in metallic state while Fe is in an oxidation state between FeO and Fe3O4 on both catalysts.

3. EXAFS fitting results provide information on the coordination numbers and bond lengths, indicating the formation of metallic NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm.

4. Ex situ STEM-EELS analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of Ni and Fe species.

Key differences and implications for catalyst performance and design:

1. A thin layer of amorphous FeOx is present on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 but absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.

2. The presence of FeOx layer in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene).

3. In Ni3Fe1/CeO2, the NiCeOx interfacial sites dominate, which are more effective for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas).

These findings suggest that controlling the Fe content and distribution can be used to tune the catalyst selectivity between dehydrogenation and reforming pathways, offering strategies for designing catalysts with desired performance in tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征的理解，具体如下：

1. 原位XRD提供了催化剂在反应条件下的结构信息，揭示了两种催化剂上都形成了具有面心立方结构的富Ni的NiFe合金。

2. 原位XANES光谱确定了Ni和Fe的价态，表明在两种催化剂上Ni处于金属态，而Fe处于FeO和Fe3O4之间的氧化态。

3. EXAFS拟合结果提供了配位数和键长信息，表明形成了直径为2.5-4.0 nm的金属NiFe合金颗粒。

4. 非原位STEM-EELS分析证实了CeO2上非晶态FeOx薄层的形成，并提供了Ni和Fe物种的空间分布信息。

关键差异和对催化剂性能和设计的影响：

1. Ni1Fe3/CeO2中CeO2颗粒上存在非晶态FeOx薄层，而Ni3Fe1/CeO2中没有。

2. Ni1Fe3/CeO2中FeOx层的存在导致NiFeOx界面位点的形成，这被认为是CO2辅助乙烷脱氢（选择性CH键裂解生成乙烯）的最可能活性位点。

3. 在Ni3Fe1/CeO2中，NiCeOx界面位点占主导地位，这些位点更有效地进行乙烷与CO2的干重整（高效CC键断裂生成合成气）。

这些发现表明，控制Fe含量和分布可用于调节催化剂在脱氢和重整途径之间的选择性，为设计具有所需性能的CO2还原和乙烷脱氢串联反应催化剂提供了策略。
