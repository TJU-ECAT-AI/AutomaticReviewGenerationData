[1] "In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."

[2] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor"

[3] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm"

[4] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."

[5] "A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17). To further verify this conclusion, EELS line-scan analysis of Fe species was conducted on the two samples."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in the following ways:

1. In situ XRD provides structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure on both catalysts.

2. In situ XANES spectroscopy determines the valence state of Ni and Fe on both catalysts under reaction conditions, showing that Ni is in metallic state while Fe exhibits an oxidation state between FeO and Fe3O4.

3. EXAFS analysis reveals the coordination numbers and bond lengths of Ni-Ni(Fe) and Fe-O, providing information about the local atomic structure and particle size of the metallic NiFe alloy.

4. Ex situ STEM-EELS analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of Ni and Fe species on the catalysts.

5. EELS line-scan analysis further verifies the presence of thin FeOx layers on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and their absence in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.

Key differences and implications:

1. Ni1Fe3/CeO2 shows a clear 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer on CeO2 particles, while Ni3Fe1/CeO2 does not exhibit this layer.

2. The presence of the FeOx layer in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane to produce ethylene.

3. In Ni3Fe1/CeO2, the absence of the FeOx layer allows for more NiCeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 to produce synthesis gas.

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design, as they demonstrate that the ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different types of interfacial sites, which in turn determine the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征的理解，具体如下：

1. 原位XRD提供了催化剂在反应条件下的结构信息，揭示了两种催化剂上都形成了面心立方结构的金属NiFe合金。

2. 原位XANES光谱确定了两种催化剂上Ni和Fe在反应条件下的价态，显示Ni处于金属态，而Fe的氧化态介于FeO和Fe3O4之间。

3. EXAFS分析揭示了Ni-Ni(Fe)和Fe-O的配位数和键长，提供了金属NiFe合金的局部原子结构和粒径信息。

4. 非原位STEM-EELS分析确认了CeO2上非晶FeOx薄层的形成，并提供了催化剂上Ni和Fe物种的空间分布信息。

5. EELS线扫描分析进一步验证了Ni1Fe3/CeO2中CeO2颗粒上存在薄FeOx层，而Ni3Fe1/CeO2中不存在这种层。

关键差异和影响：

1. Ni1Fe3/CeO2在CeO2颗粒上显示出明显的2纳米非晶FeOx层，而Ni3Fe1/CeO2不存在这种层。

2. Ni1Fe3/CeO2中FeOx层的存在导致NiFeOx界面位点的形成，这被认为是CO2辅助乙烷脱氢生成乙烯的最可能活性位点。

3. 在Ni3Fe1/CeO2中，由于缺少FeOx层，形成了更多的NiCeOx界面位点，这被认为是乙烷与CO2干重整生成合成气的最可能活性位点。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计具有重要影响，因为它们表明可以通过控制Ni和Fe的比例来调控不同类型界面位点的形成，从而决定催化剂对脱氢反应或重整反应的选择性。
