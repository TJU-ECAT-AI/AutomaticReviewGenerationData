[1] "In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."

[2] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor"

[3] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm"

[4] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."

[5] "A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17). To further verify this conclusion, EELS line-scan analysis of Fe species was conducted on the two samples."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to understanding the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. In situ XRD provided structural information about the catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure on both catalysts.

2. In situ XANES spectroscopy determined the valence state of Ni and Fe in both catalysts under reaction conditions, showing that Ni was in metallic state while Fe was in an oxidized state between FeO and Fe3O4.

3. EXAFS fitting results provided information about the local atomic structure, coordination numbers, and particle sizes of the metallic NiFe alloy.

4. Ex situ STEM-EELS analysis confirmed the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provided spatial distribution information of the different elements.

5. EELS line-scan analysis further verified the presence of FeOx layers and their distribution on the catalyst surfaces.

Key differences and implications:

1. Ni1Fe3/CeO2 showed a clear 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer on CeO2 particles, while this layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.

2. The formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 led to selective CH bond cleavage and higher ethylene selectivity.

3. The predominant NiCeOx interfacial sites in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 resulted in efficient CC bond scission and higher syngas selectivity.

These findings highlight the importance of controlling the Fe/Ni ratio and the formation of specific interfacial sites for tuning catalyst performance and selectivity in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征，具体体现在以下几个方面：

1. 原位XRD提供了反应条件下催化剂的结构信息，揭示了两种催化剂上都形成了面心立方结构的金属NiFe合金。

2. 原位XANES光谱测定了反应条件下两种催化剂中Ni和Fe的价态，表明Ni处于金属态，而Fe处于FeO和Fe3O4之间的氧化态。

3. EXAFS拟合结果提供了金属NiFe合金的局部原子结构、配位数和粒子尺寸信息。

4. 非原位STEM-EELS分析证实了CeO2上形成的无定形FeOx薄层，并提供了不同元素的空间分布信息。

5. EELS线扫描分析进一步验证了FeOx层的存在及其在催化剂表面的分布。

关键差异和影响：

1. Ni1Fe3/CeO2在CeO2颗粒上显示出明显的2纳米无定形FeOx层，而Ni3Fe1/CeO2中没有这一层。

2. Ni1Fe3/CeO2中NiFeOx界面位点的形成导致了选择性CH键断裂和更高的乙烯选择性。

3. Ni3Fe1/CeO2中占主导地位的NiCeOx界面位点导致了高效的CC键断裂和更高的合成气选择性。

这些发现强调了控制Fe/Ni比例和形成特定界面位点对于调节CO2辅助乙烷脱氢过程中催化剂性能和选择性的重要性。
