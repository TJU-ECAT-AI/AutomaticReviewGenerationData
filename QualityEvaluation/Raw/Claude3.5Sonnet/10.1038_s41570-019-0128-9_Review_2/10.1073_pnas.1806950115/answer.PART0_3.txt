[1] "Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts."

[2] "In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."

[3] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor"

[4] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm"

[5] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."

[6] "Fig. 4F shows the typical EELS line-scan profiles of Fe species over CeO2 particles for both samples. The profiles indicated the presence of a thin layer of FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while such a layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the catalysts in several ways:

1. In situ XRD provides structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the formation of Ni-rich NiFe alloy with fcc structure on both catalysts.

2. In situ XANES spectroscopy determines the valence state of Ni and Fe, showing that Ni is in metallic state while Fe is in an oxidized state between FeO and Fe3O4 on both catalysts.

3. EXAFS fitting results reveal the coordination numbers and bond lengths, indicating the formation of NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm on both catalysts.

4. Ex situ STEM-EELS analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of the metal species.

Key differences and implications:

1. The presence of a thin layer of FeOx on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2, which is absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2, suggests the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites in Ni1Fe3/CeO2.

2. The NiFeOx interfacial sites in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 are identified as active sites for selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 are active for efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas.

These findings imply that the ratio of Ni to Fe in the catalysts plays a crucial role in determining the type of active sites formed and, consequently, the selectivity of the catalyst. This understanding can guide the design of catalysts with tailored selectivity for specific reactions in the tandem CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation processes.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对催化剂的理解，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 原位XRD提供了催化剂在反应条件下的结构信息，揭示了两种催化剂上都形成了富Ni的NiFe合金，具有面心立方结构。

2. 原位XANES光谱测定了Ni和Fe的价态，表明在两种催化剂上Ni呈金属态，而Fe处于FeO和Fe3O4之间的氧化态。

3. EXAFS拟合结果揭示了配位数和键长，表明两种催化剂上都形成了直径为2.5-4.0 nm的NiFe合金颗粒。

4. 非原位STEM-EELS分析证实了在CeO2上形成了非晶态FeOx薄层，并提供了金属物种的空间分布信息。

关键差异和意义：

1. Ni1Fe3/CeO2上CeO2颗粒表面存在FeOx薄层，而Ni3Fe1/CeO2上没有，这表明Ni1Fe3/CeO2中形成了NiFeOx界面位点。

2. Ni1Fe3/CeO2中的NiFeOx界面位点被确定为选择性断裂CH键生成乙烯的活性位点，而Ni3Fe1/CeO2中的NiCeOx界面位点则有效断裂CC键生成合成气。

这些发现表明，催化剂中Ni与Fe的比例在决定形成的活性位点类型以及催化剂选择性方面起着关键作用。这一理解可以指导设计具有特定反应选择性的催化剂，用于CO2还原和乙烷脱氢的串联反应过程。
