[1] "In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed to reveal the structural information of Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 under reaction conditions."

[2] "To further determine the valence state of Ni and Fe on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2, in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected using a home-designed microchannel reactor"

[3] "The detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Figs. S14 and S15) reveal that the coordination numbers (C.N.) of NiNi(Fe) on Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 were 10.4 and 11.3, indicating metallic NiFe alloy resided in the form of particles with diameters of 2.54.0 nm"

[4] "To confirm the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2, ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) analysis was conducted on the spent Ni1Fe3/CeO2 and Ni3Fe1/CeO2 catalysts."

[5] "A layer of 2-nm amorphous FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 were clearly seen (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S17). To further verify this conclusion, EELS line-scan analysis of Fe species was conducted on the two samples."

[6] "The profiles indicated the presence of a thin layer of FeOx formed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 while such a layer was absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. In situ XRD provides structural information of the catalysts under reaction conditions, revealing the formation of metallic NiFe alloy with fcc structure on both catalysts.

2. In situ XANES spectroscopy determines the valence states of Ni and Fe, showing that Ni is in metallic state while Fe is in an oxidized state between FeO and Fe3O4 on both catalysts.

3. EXAFS fitting results provide information on the coordination numbers and bond lengths, indicating the formation of NiFe alloy particles with diameters of 2.5-4.0 nm on both catalysts.

4. Ex situ STEM-EELS analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx thin layers on CeO2 and provides spatial distribution information of different elements.

Key differences and implications:

1. A 2-nm amorphous FeOx layer is clearly observed on CeO2 particles in Ni1Fe3/CeO2, while such a layer is absent in Ni3Fe1/CeO2.

2. The presence of the FeOx layer in Ni1Fe3/CeO2 leads to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene).

3. The absence of the FeOx layer in Ni3Fe1/CeO2 results in the dominance of NiCeOx interfacial sites, which are identified as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas).

These findings have significant implications for catalyst performance and design, as they demonstrate that the ratio of Ni to Fe can be used to control the formation of different interfacial sites, thereby tuning the selectivity of the catalyst towards either dehydrogenation or reforming reactions.

先进的原位和非原位分析技术协同贡献于我们对Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征的理解，具体方式如下：

1. 原位XRD提供了催化剂在反应条件下的结构信息，揭示了两种催化剂上都形成了面心立方结构的金属NiFe合金。

2. 原位XANES光谱测定了Ni和Fe的价态，表明在两种催化剂上Ni处于金属态，而Fe处于FeO和Fe3O4之间的氧化态。

3. EXAFS拟合结果提供了配位数和键长信息，表明两种催化剂上形成了直径为2.5-4.0 nm的NiFe合金颗粒。

4. 非原位STEM-EELS分析证实了CeO2上非晶FeOx薄层的形成，并提供了不同元素的空间分布信息。

关键差异和意义：

1. 在Ni1Fe3/CeO2的CeO2颗粒上清晰观察到2nm厚的非晶FeOx层，而在Ni3Fe1/CeO2中没有这样的层。

2. Ni1Fe3/CeO2中FeOx层的存在导致形成NiFeOx界面位点，这被认为是CO2辅助乙烷脱氢（选择性CH键断裂生成乙烯）的最可能活性位点。

3. Ni3Fe1/CeO2中FeOx层的缺失导致NiCeOx界面位点占主导地位，这被认为是乙烷与CO2干重整（有效CC键断裂生成合成气）的最可能活性位点。

这些发现对催化剂性能和设计有重要意义，因为它们表明可以通过控制Ni与Fe的比例来控制不同界面位点的形成，从而调节催化剂对脱氢或重整反应的选择性。
