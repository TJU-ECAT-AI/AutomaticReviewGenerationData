The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques mentioned synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. XRD provides information on the reversible structural evolution of the catalysts under different gas environments and temperatures.

2. XANES and EXAFS analyses offer insights into the oxidation states and local coordination environments of Fe and Ni species during redox treatments.

3. ADF-STEM imaging with EELS mapping reveals the spatial distribution and morphology of metal nanoparticles on the ceria support.

These techniques together uncover distinct differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in terms of their structural properties, reducibility, and metal-support interactions. These differences correlate with the catalysts' performance in CO2 hydrogenation reactions, which has implications for catalyst design and optimization. The combination of these techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalysts' characteristics, allowing researchers to make informed decisions in improving catalyst performance and designing new catalytic systems.
