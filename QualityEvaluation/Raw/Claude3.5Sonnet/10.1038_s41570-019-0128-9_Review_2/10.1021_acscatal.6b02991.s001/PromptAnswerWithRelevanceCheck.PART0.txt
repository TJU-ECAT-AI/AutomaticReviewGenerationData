Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques synergistically contribute to our understanding of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts in several ways:

1. XRD provided information on the crystalline phases present in the fresh catalysts, identifying CeO2 support and metallic Fe and Ni phases.

2. XANES spectroscopy at the Fe K-edge revealed the oxidation states of Fe in both catalysts, showing a mixture of Fe0 and Fe2+ species, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 having a higher proportion of Fe0.

3. EXAFS analysis at the Fe K-edge provided insights into the local atomic structure, indicating larger Fe-rich particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 based on higher Fe-Fe coordination numbers.

4. ADF-STEM imaging combined with EELS mapping allowed for visualization of the spatial distribution and morphology of Fe and Ni species on the CeO2 support.

5. In situ XANES measurements during CO2 hydrogenation revealed dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state under reaction conditions, showing partial oxidation.

Key differences and implications:

1. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 had a higher proportion of Fe0 and larger Fe-rich particles compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which could affect catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. The spatial distribution and morphology of Fe and Ni species on the CeO2 support differed between the two catalysts, potentially influencing their performance.

3. The observed dynamic changes in Fe oxidation state during reaction conditions highlight the importance of in situ studies for understanding catalyst behavior under operating conditions.

These findings have implications for catalyst design, emphasizing the need to consider both composition and structure in optimizing catalyst performance. The combination of techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalysts, allowing for more informed decisions in catalyst development and optimization.
