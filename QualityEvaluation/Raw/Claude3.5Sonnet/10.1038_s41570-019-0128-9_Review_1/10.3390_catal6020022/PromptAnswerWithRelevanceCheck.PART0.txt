Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2, or their comparison with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on other types of catalysts and oxidation reactions, but does not mention the specific catalysts and reactions asked about in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODH reactions. The document primarily focuses on partial oxidation reactions using metal oxide catalysts, but does not specifically mention the catalysts or reactions asked about in the question. Without relevant information in the provided text, I cannot make a comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts or discuss their relative performance, mechanisms, or factors affecting their behavior in CO2-ODH reactions.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的科学文献中没有任何关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或它们在CO2-ODH反应中的性能的信息。该文档主要关注使用金属氧化物催化剂的部分氧化反应,但没有特别提到问题中询问的催化剂或反应。由于提供的文本中没有相关信息,我无法比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂,也无法讨论它们在CO2-ODH反应中的相对性能、机理或影响它们行为的因素。
