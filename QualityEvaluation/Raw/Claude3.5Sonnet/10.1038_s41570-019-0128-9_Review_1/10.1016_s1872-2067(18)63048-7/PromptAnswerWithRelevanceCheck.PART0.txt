<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium-based catalysts supported on MCM-41 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It does not provide any comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The literature provided does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on MCM-41 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as an oxidant. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of their activity, selectivity, reaction mechanisms, or discuss the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts based on this literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or comparisons with vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on vanadium-containing MCM-41 catalysts (nV-MCM-41) for propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It does not discuss Fe-Ni catalysts or CeO2 supports. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison or answer the specific questions about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts based on this literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on MCM-41 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) using CO2 as an oxidant. It does not provide any comparison between these catalysts and FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, I cannot answer the question about how FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts compare to vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions based on the given information.
