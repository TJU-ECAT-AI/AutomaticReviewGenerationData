Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various materials for the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或特定的Fe3Ni1/CeO2的信息。该文档主要讨论了在二氧化碳存在下,负载于各种材料上的钒氧化物催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢反应。它没有讨论或比较这些催化剂与FexNiy/CeO2催化剂。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
