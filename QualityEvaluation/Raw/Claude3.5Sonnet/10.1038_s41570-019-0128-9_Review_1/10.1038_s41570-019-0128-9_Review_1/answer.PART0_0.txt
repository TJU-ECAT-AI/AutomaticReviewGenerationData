[2] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni"

[4] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in the CO2-ODH of C2H6, which is attributed to the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites. This selectivity is higher than that typically reported for V2O5 catalysts.

In terms of reaction mechanisms, V oxide catalysts often operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, while the mechanism for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts is not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the bimetallic nature of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts suggests a potentially different mechanism from V oxide catalysts.

Support materials play crucial roles in both catalyst systems. For V oxide catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion of the active phase. Similarly, for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial due to its reducibility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms, which can help prevent coking.

Composition is a key factor in determining performance for both catalyst types. For V oxide catalysts, the dispersion of VOx on the support is critical, with polymeric V species leading to low alkene yield. In the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the ratio of Fe to Ni significantly affects selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming.

Structural factors, such as the dispersion of the active phase on the support, are important for both catalyst systems. For V oxide catalysts, highly dispersed VOx species on the support lead to better performance than bulk V2O5.

While both catalyst systems show promise, they face different challenges. V2O5 catalysts struggle with the presence of acidic sites that promote alkene cracking and have health concerns related to V2O5 dust. The challenges specific to FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts are not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, but further research into optimizing the Fe-Ni interaction and understanding the reaction mechanism could lead to improvements in their performance.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中相比钒氧化物催化剂显示出一些优势。Fe3Ni1/CeO2在C2H6的CO2-ODH反应中表现出高C2H4选择性（>75%），这归因于Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点。这种选择性高于通常报道的V2O5催化剂。

在反应机理方面，V氧化物催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机理运作，而FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的机理在给定的文献中并未明确说明。然而，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的双金属性质暗示了可能与V氧化物催化剂不同的机理。

载体材料在两种催化剂系统中都起着关键作用。对于V氧化物催化剂，载体影响还原性、酸碱性质和活性相的分散度。同样，对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，CeO2作为载体至关重要，因为它的还原性以及释放和回收氧原子的能力，可以帮助防止结焦。

组成是决定两种催化剂类型性能的关键因素。对于V氧化物催化剂，VOx在载体上的分散是至关重要的，聚合的V物种导致低烯烃产率。对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，Fe与Ni的比例显著影响选择性，Fe3Ni1/CeO2有利于CO2-ODH，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2有利于干重整。

结构因素，如活性相在载体上的分散，对两种催化剂系统都很重要。对于V氧化物催化剂，高度分散在载体上的VOx物种比块状V2O5表现更好。

虽然两种催化剂系统都显示出前景，但它们面临不同的挑战。V2O5催化剂面临促进烯烃裂解的酸性位点问题，以及与V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂特有的挑战在给定的文献中没有明确提及，但进一步研究优化Fe-Ni相互作用和理解反应机理可能会导致其性能的改进。
