[1] "Flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR"

[2] "V oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion"

[3] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."

[4] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."

[5] "Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle"

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts show higher selectivity for C2H4 production (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity, but suffer from declining conversion over time. 

Both types of catalysts are significantly influenced by their support materials. For V2O5, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to stabilization of active surface structures.

The reaction mechanisms differ. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts likely operate through a direct CO2-ODH pathway, while V-based catalysts can follow either a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway involving the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Structural factors play a key role for both catalyst types. For V2O5, dispersion on the support is crucial for selectivity, with polymeric species leading to low alkene yield. The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity.

V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, but further research is needed to fully understand their potential for improvement.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出更高的C2H4选择性（>75%），相比之下，钒氧化物催化剂的性能较差。V2O5催化剂可以达到90%的丙烯选择性，但随时间推移转化率会下降。

两种类型的催化剂都受到载体材料的显著影响。对于V2O5，载体影响其还原性、酸碱性和分散性。负载的VOx催化剂比体相V2O5更具选择性，这是由于活性表面结构的稳定化。

反应机理不同。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂可能通过直接CO2-ODH途径进行，而基于V的催化剂可以遵循一步氧化脱氢途径或涉及逆水气变换反应的两步途径。

结构因素对两种催化剂类型都起关键作用。对于V2O5，在载体上的分散对选择性至关重要，聚合物物种导致烯烃产率低。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中Fe:Ni比例对产物选择性有显著影响。

V2O5催化剂面临酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘相关健康问题的挑战。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂在克服这些限制方面显示出前景，但需要进一步研究以充分了解其改进潜力。
