[1] "Flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR"

[2] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni"

[3] "V oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion"

[4] "Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."

[5] "In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acidbase bifunctionality"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in the CO2-ODH of C2H6, which is attributed to the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites. This selectivity is higher than that typically reported for V2O5 catalysts.

In terms of reaction mechanisms, V oxide catalysts often operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, while the mechanism for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts is not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the bimetallic nature of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts suggests a potentially different mechanism from V oxide catalysts.

Support materials play crucial roles in both catalyst systems. For V oxide catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion of the active phase. Similarly, for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial due to its reducibility and ability to release and recover oxygen atoms, which can help prevent coking.

Composition is a key factor in determining performance for both catalyst types. For V oxide catalysts, the dispersion of VOx on the support is critical, with polymeric V species leading to low alkene yield. In the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the ratio of Fe to Ni significantly affects selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming.

Structural factors, such as the dispersion of the active phase on the support, are important for both catalyst systems. For V oxide catalysts, highly dispersed VOx species on the support lead to better performance than bulk V2O5.

While both catalyst systems show promise, they face different challenges. V2O5 catalysts struggle with the presence of acidic sites that promote alkene cracking and have health concerns related to V2O5 dust. The challenges specific to FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts are not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, but further research into optimizing the Fe-Ni interaction and understanding the reaction mechanism could lead to improvements in their performance.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中相比钒氧化物催化剂显示出一些优势。Fe3Ni1/CeO2在C2H6的CO2-ODH反应中表现出高C2H4选择性（>75%），这归因于Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点。这种选择性高于通常报道的V2O5催化剂。

在反应机理方面，V氧化物催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机理运作，而FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的机理在给定的文献中并未明确说明。然而，FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的双金属性质暗示了可能与V氧化物催化剂不同的机理。

载体材料在两种催化剂系统中都起着关键作用。对于V氧化物催化剂，载体影响还原性、酸碱性质和活性相的分散度。同样，对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，CeO2作为载体至关重要，因为它的还原性以及释放和回收氧原子的能力，可以帮助防止结焦。

组成是决定两种催化剂类型性能的关键因素。对于V氧化物催化剂，VOx在载体上的分散是至关重要的，聚合的V物种导致低烯烃产率。对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，Fe与Ni的比例显著影响选择性，Fe3Ni1/CeO2有利于CO2-ODH，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2有利于干重整。

结构因素，如活性相在载体上的分散，对两种催化剂系统都很重要。对于V氧化物催化剂，高度分散在载体上的VOx物种比块状V2O5表现更好。

虽然两种催化剂系统都显示出前景，但它们面临不同的挑战。V2O5催化剂面临促进烯烃裂解的酸性位点问题，以及与V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂特有的挑战在给定的文献中没有明确提及，但进一步研究优化Fe-Ni相互作用和理解反应机理可能会导致其性能的改进。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts show higher selectivity for C2H4 (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. While V2O5 catalysts have shown promise, they face challenges such as the presence of acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalyst types. V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity. In contrast, the high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is attributed to distinct active sites formed by the interaction between Fe and Ni.

Support materials play a significant role in both catalyst systems. For V2O5 catalysts, the nature of the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion, which in turn influence catalyst activity. In the case of Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the CeO2 support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking by providing reactive lattice oxygen atoms.

The composition of the catalysts is also a key factor. For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the specific ratio of Fe to Ni (3:1) results in the highest C2H4 selectivity, while other ratios like Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favor CO production through dry reforming. This demonstrates the importance of fine-tuning the bimetallic composition to achieve desired selectivity.

Structural factors, such as the dispersion of active components on the support, are important for both catalyst types. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5. Similarly, the interaction between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 creates unique active sites that contribute to its high selectivity.

The potential for improvement in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts lies in further optimization of the bimetallic composition and understanding the specific nature of the Fe-Ni interaction. For V2O5 catalysts, addressing the challenges of acidic site-induced cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust are key areas for future development.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出比钒氧化物催化剂更高的C2H4选择性(>75%)。尽管V2O5催化剂表现出前景，但它们面临一些挑战，如酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘引起的健康问题。

两种催化剂类型的反应机理不同。V基催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机理运作，其中来自支持材料的氧原子在提高烯烃选择性方面起着关键作用。相比之下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2的高选择性归因于Fe和Ni相互作用形成的独特活性位点。

支持材料在两种催化剂系统中都起着重要作用。对于V2O5催化剂，支持材料的性质影响还原性、酸碱性质和分散性，进而影响催化剂活性。对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，CeO2支持材料对CO2活化至关重要，并通过提供反应性晶格氧原子帮助防止结焦。

催化剂的组成也是一个关键因素。对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，Fe和Ni的特定比例(3:1)产生最高的C2H4选择性，而其他比例如Fe1Ni3/CeO2则通过干重整反应有利于CO的生成。这表明精细调整双金属组成对于实现所需选择性的重要性。

结构因素，如活性组分在支持材料上的分散性，对两种催化剂类型都很重要。对于V2O5催化剂，在支持材料上的更好分散导致比块状V2O5性能更好。同样，Fe3Ni1/CeO2中Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点，有助于其高选择性。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂的改进潜力在于进一步优化双金属组成和理解Fe-Ni相互作用的具体性质。对于V2O5催化剂，解决酸性位点引起的裂解和V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题是未来发展的关键领域。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts show higher selectivity for C2H4 production (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity, but suffer from declining conversion over time. 

Both types of catalysts are significantly influenced by their support materials. For V2O5, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to stabilization of active surface structures.

The reaction mechanisms differ. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts likely operate through a direct CO2-ODH pathway, while V-based catalysts can follow either a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway involving the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Structural factors play a key role for both catalyst types. For V2O5, dispersion on the support is crucial for selectivity, with polymeric species leading to low alkene yield. The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity.

V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, but further research is needed to fully understand their potential for improvement.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出更高的C2H4选择性（>75%），相比之下，钒氧化物催化剂的性能较差。V2O5催化剂可以达到90%的丙烯选择性，但随时间推移转化率会下降。

两种类型的催化剂都受到载体材料的显著影响。对于V2O5，载体影响其还原性、酸碱性和分散性。负载的VOx催化剂比体相V2O5更具选择性，这是由于活性表面结构的稳定化。

反应机理不同。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂可能通过直接CO2-ODH途径进行，而基于V的催化剂可以遵循一步氧化脱氢途径或涉及逆水气变换反应的两步途径。

结构因素对两种催化剂类型都起关键作用。对于V2O5，在载体上的分散对选择性至关重要，聚合物物种导致烯烃产率低。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中Fe:Ni比例对产物选择性有显著影响。

V2O5催化剂面临酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘相关健康问题的挑战。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂在克服这些限制方面显示出前景，但需要进一步研究以充分了解其改进潜力。

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. While V2O5 dispersed in SiO2 can achieve 90% propylene selectivity, its conversion decreases significantly within one cycle. In contrast, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 maintains a high C2H4 selectivity of over 75%.

The support material plays a crucial role in both types of catalysts. For vanadium oxides, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. In FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support promotes CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms.

The composition of the bimetallic catalyst is critical in determining performance. The Fe3Ni1 ratio shows the highest selectivity for CO2-ODH, while different ratios like Fe1Ni3 favor other reactions such as dry reforming. This suggests that the interaction between Fe and Ni creates unique active sites that promote CO2-ODH.

While vanadium oxide catalysts often operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reaction mechanism for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts is not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the role of CeO2 in oxygen mobility suggests that a redox mechanism may be involved.

Both types of catalysts face challenges. Vanadium oxide catalysts struggle with acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts seem to address the coking issue better due to the properties of the CeO2 support, but their long-term stability and potential for further improvement are not discussed in the given literature.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中显示出一些优于钒氧化物催化剂的优势。虽然分散在SiO2中的V2O5可以达到90%的丙烯选择性，但其转化率在一个循环内显著下降。相比之下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2保持着超过75%的高C2H4选择性。

在这两种类型的催化剂中，载体材料都起着至关重要的作用。对于钒氧化物，载体影响其还原性、酸碱性质和分散性。在FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中，CeO2作为载体促进CO2的活化，并由于其释放和回收氧原子的能力而有助于防止结焦。

双金属催化剂的组成对决定性能至关重要。Fe3Ni1比例显示出最高的CO2-ODH选择性，而不同的比例如Fe1Ni3则有利于其他反应，如干重整。这表明Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点，促进了CO2-ODH。

虽然钒氧化物催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运作，但给定文献中并未明确说明FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的反应机制。然而，CeO2在氧移动性中的作用表明可能涉及氧化还原机制。

这两种类型的催化剂都面临挑战。钒氧化物催化剂存在酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂由于CeO2载体的特性，似乎能更好地解决结焦问题，但给定文献中没有讨论它们的长期稳定性和进一步改进的潜力。
