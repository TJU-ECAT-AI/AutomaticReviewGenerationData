Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts show higher selectivity for C2H4 (>75%) in CO2-ODH reactions compared to vanadium oxide catalysts. While V2O5 catalysts have shown promise, they face challenges such as the presence of acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalyst types. V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity. In contrast, the high selectivity of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is attributed to distinct active sites formed by the interaction between Fe and Ni.

Support materials play a significant role in both catalyst systems. For V2O5 catalysts, the nature of the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion, which in turn influence catalyst activity. In the case of Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the CeO2 support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking by providing reactive lattice oxygen atoms.

The composition of the catalysts is also a key factor. For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the specific ratio of Fe to Ni (3:1) results in the highest C2H4 selectivity, while other ratios like Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favor CO production through dry reforming. This demonstrates the importance of fine-tuning the bimetallic composition to achieve desired selectivity.

Structural factors, such as the dispersion of active components on the support, are important for both catalyst types. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5. Similarly, the interaction between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 creates unique active sites that contribute to its high selectivity.

The potential for improvement in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts lies in further optimization of the bimetallic composition and understanding the specific nature of the Fe-Ni interaction. For V2O5 catalysts, addressing the challenges of acidic site-induced cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust are key areas for future development.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中表现出比钒氧化物催化剂更高的C2H4选择性(>75%)。尽管V2O5催化剂表现出前景，但它们面临一些挑战，如酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘引起的健康问题。

两种催化剂类型的反应机理不同。V基催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机理运作，其中来自支持材料的氧原子在提高烯烃选择性方面起着关键作用。相比之下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2的高选择性归因于Fe和Ni相互作用形成的独特活性位点。

支持材料在两种催化剂系统中都起着重要作用。对于V2O5催化剂，支持材料的性质影响还原性、酸碱性质和分散性，进而影响催化剂活性。对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，CeO2支持材料对CO2活化至关重要，并通过提供反应性晶格氧原子帮助防止结焦。

催化剂的组成也是一个关键因素。对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，Fe和Ni的特定比例(3:1)产生最高的C2H4选择性，而其他比例如Fe1Ni3/CeO2则通过干重整反应有利于CO的生成。这表明精细调整双金属组成对于实现所需选择性的重要性。

结构因素，如活性组分在支持材料上的分散性，对两种催化剂类型都很重要。对于V2O5催化剂，在支持材料上的更好分散导致比块状V2O5性能更好。同样，Fe3Ni1/CeO2中Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点，有助于其高选择性。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂的改进潜力在于进一步优化双金属组成和理解Fe-Ni相互作用的具体性质。对于V2O5催化剂，解决酸性位点引起的裂解和V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题是未来发展的关键领域。
