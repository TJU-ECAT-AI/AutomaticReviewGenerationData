[1] "V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle"

[2] "Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."

[3] "Flow reactions over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 afforded C2H4 by means of selective CH cleavage. The supported bimetallic catalyst is more stable than the supported monometallics Fe/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2"

[4] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR"

[5] "Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni"

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions:

1. Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH of ethane, while V2O5 catalysts can achieve 90% propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. However, V2O5 catalysts face challenges with acidic sites promoting alkene cracking.

2. Stability: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits better stability compared to supported monometallic catalysts. V2O5 catalysts show promising performance but struggle with stability issues.

3. Reaction mechanism: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 operates through selective C-H cleavage, while V2O5 catalysts typically follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

4. Support materials: CeO2 support in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts plays a crucial role in CO2 activation and coke removal. For V2O5 catalysts, support materials affect reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion.

5. Composition effects: The interaction between Fe and Ni in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 creates distinct active sites, leading to high selectivity. For V2O5 catalysts, the dispersion and size of VOx species on the support influence catalytic performance.

6. Challenges: V2O5 catalysts face issues with alkene cracking and potential health concerns from V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts seem to have fewer reported challenges, but more research is needed to fully understand their limitations.

Overall, while both catalyst types show promise for CO2-ODH reactions, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 appears to offer advantages in terms of stability and selectivity, with fewer reported challenges compared to V2O5 catalysts.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中相比钒氧化物催化剂显示出一些优势：

1. 选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2在乙烷的CO2-ODH反应中表现出高乙烯选择性（>75%），而V2O5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中可以达到90%的丙烯选择性。然而，V2O5催化剂面临酸性位点促进烯烃裂解的挑战。

2. 稳定性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2相比单金属负载催化剂展现出更好的稳定性。V2O5催化剂虽然性能promising，但仍存在稳定性问题。

3. 反应机理：Fe3Ni1/CeO2通过选择性C-H键断裂进行反应，而V2O5催化剂通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。

4. 载体材料：FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中的CeO2载体在CO2活化和焦炭去除中起关键作用。对于V2O5催化剂，载体材料影响其可还原性、酸碱性质和分散度。

5. 组成效应：Fe3Ni1/CeO2中Fe和Ni的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点，导致高选择性。对于V2O5催化剂，载体上VOx物种的分散度和尺寸影响催化性能。

6. 挑战：V2O5催化剂面临烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘潜在健康问题的挑战。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂似乎报道的挑战较少，但需要更多研究来充分理解其局限性。

总的来说，虽然两种类型的催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中都显示出前景，但Fe3Ni1/CeO2在稳定性和选择性方面似乎具有优势，且报道的挑战较少，相比V2O5催化剂。
