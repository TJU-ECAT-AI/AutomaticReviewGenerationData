FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. While V2O5 dispersed in SiO2 can achieve 90% propylene selectivity, its conversion decreases significantly within one cycle. In contrast, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 maintains a high C2H4 selectivity of over 75%.

The support material plays a crucial role in both types of catalysts. For vanadium oxides, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. In FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support promotes CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms.

The composition of the bimetallic catalyst is critical in determining performance. The Fe3Ni1 ratio shows the highest selectivity for CO2-ODH, while different ratios like Fe1Ni3 favor other reactions such as dry reforming. This suggests that the interaction between Fe and Ni creates unique active sites that promote CO2-ODH.

While vanadium oxide catalysts often operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reaction mechanism for FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts is not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the role of CeO2 in oxygen mobility suggests that a redox mechanism may be involved.

Both types of catalysts face challenges. Vanadium oxide catalysts struggle with acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts seem to address the coking issue better due to the properties of the CeO2 support, but their long-term stability and potential for further improvement are not discussed in the given literature.

FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中显示出一些优于钒氧化物催化剂的优势。虽然分散在SiO2中的V2O5可以达到90%的丙烯选择性，但其转化率在一个循环内显著下降。相比之下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2保持着超过75%的高C2H4选择性。

在这两种类型的催化剂中，载体材料都起着至关重要的作用。对于钒氧化物，载体影响其还原性、酸碱性质和分散性。在FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中，CeO2作为载体促进CO2的活化，并由于其释放和回收氧原子的能力而有助于防止结焦。

双金属催化剂的组成对决定性能至关重要。Fe3Ni1比例显示出最高的CO2-ODH选择性，而不同的比例如Fe1Ni3则有利于其他反应，如干重整。这表明Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点，促进了CO2-ODH。

虽然钒氧化物催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运作，但给定文献中并未明确说明FexNiy/CeO2催化剂的反应机制。然而，CeO2在氧移动性中的作用表明可能涉及氧化还原机制。

这两种类型的催化剂都面临挑战。钒氧化物催化剂存在酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘相关的健康问题。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂由于CeO2载体的特性，似乎能更好地解决结焦问题，但给定文献中没有讨论它们的长期稳定性和进一步改进的潜力。
