          "Flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR"

"Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni"

"V oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion"

"Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."

"Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity"

"Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."

"V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle"

"Flow reactions over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 afforded C2H4 by means of selective CH cleavage. The supported bimetallic catalyst is more stable than the supported monometallics Fe/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2"

"The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms protects the material because any coke deposits that form can be readily removed by oxidation"

          FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions:

1. Activity and Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH of ethane. V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity, but suffer from declining conversion over time (60% to 20% within one cycle).

2. Reaction Mechanisms: V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity.

3. Support Materials: For both catalyst types, support materials play a significant role. In V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms.

4. Composition and Structure: The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5.

5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement: V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking. However, further research is needed to fully understand their potential for improvement and long-term stability.

          FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在CO2-ODH反应中相比钒氧化物催化剂显示出一些优势：

1. 活性和选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2在乙烷的CO2-ODH反应中表现出高C2H4选择性（>75%）。V2O5催化剂可以达到90%的丙烯选择性，但随时间推移转化率会显著下降（在一个循环内从60%降至20%）。

2. 反应机理：基于V的催化剂通常通过Mars-van Krevelen机理运作，其中来自载体的氧原子在提高烯烃选择性方面起着关键作用。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂通过选择性C-H键断裂进行反应，Fe和Ni之间的相互作用创造了独特的活性位点，有助于其高选择性。

3. 载体材料：对于两种类型的催化剂，载体材料都起着重要作用。对于V2O5催化剂，载体影响其还原性、酸碱性质和分散性。对于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，CeO2作为载体对CO2活化至关重要，并通过其释放和回收氧原子的能力帮助防止结焦。

4. 组成和结构：FexNiy/CeO2催化剂中Fe:Ni的比例显著影响产物选择性，Fe3Ni1/CeO2有利于CO2-ODH，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2有利于干重整。对于V2O5催化剂，在载体上的更好分散导致比块状V2O5性能更好。

5. 挑战和改进潜力：V2O5催化剂面临酸性位点促进烯烃裂解和V2O5粉尘相关健康问题的挑战。FexNiy/CeO2催化剂在克服这些限制方面显示出前景，提供更好的稳定性和抗结焦性能。然而，需要进一步研究以充分了解它们的改进潜力和长期稳定性。
