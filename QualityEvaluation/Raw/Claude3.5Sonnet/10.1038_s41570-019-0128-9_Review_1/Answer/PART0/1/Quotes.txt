"Flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR"

"Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni"

"V oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion"

"Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOxsupport interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures."

"Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity"

"Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust."

"V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle"

"Flow reactions over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 afforded C2H4 by means of selective CH cleavage. The supported bimetallic catalyst is more stable than the supported monometallics Fe/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2"

"The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms protects the material because any coke deposits that form can be readily removed by oxidation"

[1] "FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward the ODEC pathway to form ethylene with selectivity up to 30%."

          [2] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage. Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."

          [3] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

          [4] "Reducible CeO2 oxide, known for its ability to promote active metal dispersion and to shift easily between reduced and oxidized states which help accommodate CO2 dissociation [21], is used as the oxide support in this work."
