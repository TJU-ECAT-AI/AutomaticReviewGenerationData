FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, show some advantages over vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions:

1. Activity and Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH of ethane. V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity, but suffer from declining conversion over time (60% to 20% within one cycle).

2. Reaction Mechanisms: V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity.

3. Support Materials: For both catalyst types, support materials play a significant role. In V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms.

4. Composition and Structure: The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5.

5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement: V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking. However, further research is needed to fully understand their potential for improvement and long-term stability.

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

          1. Activity and selectivity: FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC), with ethylene selectivity up to 30%.

          2. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations indicate that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene.

          3. Support material: CeO2 is used as the support due to its ability to promote active metal dispersion and facilitate CO2 dissociation through its redox properties.

          4. Composition and structural factors: The mixed FeNi surface is found to be more favorable for the ODEC pathway compared to Ni-terminated surfaces, suggesting that the composition and structure of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining its performance.

          5. Challenges and potential for improvement: The literature does not explicitly discuss challenges or potential improvements for FeNi/CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

          To fully compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts and address all aspects of the question, additional research focusing specifically on these comparisons would be necessary.
