Activity and Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH of ethane. V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity, but suffer from declining conversion over time (60% to 20% within one cycle).\n\n2.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity.\n\n3. Support Materials: For both catalyst types, support materials play a significant role. In V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms.\n\n4.
