A comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH (carbon dioxide oxidative dehydrogenation) reactions reveals significant differences in their performance, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, with their unique composition of iron and nickel supported on cerium oxide, have shown promising results in terms of conversion rates and product yield. On the other hand, vanadium oxide catalysts, known for their versatility in oxidation reactions, exhibit different selectivity patterns and activation energies. The support material plays a crucial role in both catalyst systems, with CeO2 enhancing oxygen mobility and redox properties in FexNiy catalysts, while various supports like Al2O3 or SiO2 influence the dispersion and activity of vanadium oxide. The composition of these catalysts, particularly the Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 and the oxidation state of vanadium, significantly impacts the reaction pathways and product distribution. Understanding these differences is essential for optimizing catalyst design and achieving desired product selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions, which are becoming increasingly important in the context of carbon dioxide utilization and sustainable chemistry.
