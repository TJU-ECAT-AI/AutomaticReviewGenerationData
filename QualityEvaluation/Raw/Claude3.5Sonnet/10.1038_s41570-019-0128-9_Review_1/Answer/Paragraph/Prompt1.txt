Activity and Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH of ethane. V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity, but suffer from declining conversion over time (60% to 20% within one cycle).\n\n2. Reaction Mechanisms: V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity.\n\n3. Support Materials: For both catalyst types, support materials play a significant role. In V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms.\n\n4. Composition and Structure: The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5.\n\n5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement: V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking.
