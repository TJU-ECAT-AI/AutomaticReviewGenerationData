Comparative Analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and Vanadium Oxide Catalysts in CO2-ODH Reactions: Performance, Selectivity, and the Influence of Supports and Composition on Reaction Mechanisms and Product Formation

The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable alkene production. This review focuses on comparing the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

1. Activity and Selectivity:
FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, have demonstrated remarkable performance in CO2-ODH reactions. Flow reactor results indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 achieves high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. In comparison, V2O5 catalysts dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit up to 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles. However, V2O5 catalysts suffer from declining conversion over time, decreasing from 60% to 20% within one cycle [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1].

2. Reaction Mechanisms:
The reaction mechanisms of these catalyst systems differ significantly. V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. In contrast, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage. DFT calculations on mixed FeNi(111) surfaces indicate that the CH bond cleavage pathway is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

3. Support Materials:
For both catalyst types, support materials play a significant role in determining catalytic performance. In V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. The reducible nature of CeO2 promotes active metal dispersion and facilitates CO2 dissociation through its redox properties [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

4. Composition and Structural Factors:
The composition and structure of these catalysts significantly influence their performance. In FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the Fe:Ni ratio dramatically affects product selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CO2-ODH, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 shows the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) through dry reforming [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. The interaction between Fe and Ni creates distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1].

5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement:
V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1]. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking. The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms in CeO2 protects the material by readily removing any coke deposits through oxidation [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_1].



Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook:
The comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions reveals promising avenues for future research and development. The superior performance of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 in terms of selectivity and stability suggests that further exploration of bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible oxides could lead to significant advancements in CO2-ODH processes.

Future research directions may include:

1. Optimization of FexNiy ratios and dispersion on CeO2 supports to further enhance selectivity and stability.
2. Investigation of other bimetallic combinations supported on CeO2 or similar reducible oxides to identify potentially superior catalysts.
3. In-depth mechanistic studies to elucidate the synergistic effects between Fe and Ni, and their interaction with the CeO2 support.
4. Development of novel synthesis methods to control the surface structure and composition of bimetallic catalysts more precisely.
5. Long-term stability studies and scale-up experiments to assess the industrial viability of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts.
6. Exploration of strategies to mitigate the challenges faced by V2O5 catalysts, such as developing new support materials or modifying surface properties to reduce acidity and improve stability.

These research directions could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions, contributing to the broader goal of utilizing CO2 as a feedstock in chemical processes.

A comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH (carbon dioxide oxidative dehydrogenation) reactions reveals significant differences in their performance, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, with their unique composition of iron and nickel supported on cerium oxide, have shown promising results in terms of conversion rates and product yield. On the other hand, vanadium oxide catalysts, known for their versatility in oxidation reactions, exhibit different selectivity patterns and activation energies. The support material plays a crucial role in both catalyst systems, with CeO2 enhancing oxygen mobility and redox properties in FexNiy catalysts, while various supports like Al2O3 or SiO2 influence the dispersion and activity of vanadium oxide. The composition of these catalysts, particularly the Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 and the oxidation state of vanadium, significantly impacts the reaction pathways and product distribution. Understanding these differences is essential for optimizing catalyst design and achieving desired product selectivity in CO2-ODH reactions, which are becoming increasingly important in the context of carbon dioxide utilization and sustainable chemistry.
