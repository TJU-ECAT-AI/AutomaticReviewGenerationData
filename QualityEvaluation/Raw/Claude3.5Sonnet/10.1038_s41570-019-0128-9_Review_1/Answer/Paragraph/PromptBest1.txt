Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable production of valuable olefins. This review compares the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, focusing on their activity, selectivity, and the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors.

1. Activity and Selectivity:
FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, have demonstrated promising performance in CO2-ODH reactions. Flow reactor results indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In comparison, vanadium oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres, can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity. However, V2O5 catalysts suffer from declining conversion over time, decreasing from 60% to 20% within one 8-hour cycle [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

2. Reaction Mechanisms:
The reaction mechanisms of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts differ significantly. V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In contrast, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. DFT calculations on FeNi(111) surfaces confirm that the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

3. Support Materials:
The choice of support material plays a significant role in the performance of both catalyst types. For V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to VOx-support interactions stabilizing particularly active VOx surface structures [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. The reducible nature of CeO2 promotes active metal dispersion and facilitates CO2 dissociation through its redox properties [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

4. Composition and Structural Factors:
The composition and structure of the catalysts significantly influence their performance. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the Fe:Ni ratio dramatically affects product selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CO2-ODH, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 shows the highest yield of CO (>98% selectivity) through dry reforming [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. The mixed FeNi surface is found to be more favorable for the ODEC pathway compared to Ni-terminated surfaces [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004]. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement:
Both catalyst types face unique challenges. V2O5 catalysts struggle with acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking. The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms in CeO2 protects the material by readily removing any coke deposits through oxidation [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there are several promising avenues for future research in CO2-ODH catalysis. The superior performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in terms of selectivity and stability, suggests that further exploration of bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible oxides could lead to significant breakthroughs. Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Optimizing the composition and structure of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts to further enhance selectivity and stability.
2. Investigating other bimetallic combinations supported on CeO2 or alternative reducible oxides to discover potentially superior catalysts.
3. Developing strategies to mitigate the decline in conversion observed in vanadium oxide catalysts while maintaining their high selectivity.
4. Exploring the potential of combining the best features of both catalyst types, such as incorporating vanadium into FexNiy/CeO2 systems to create novel trimetallic catalysts.
5. Conducting in-depth mechanistic studies to better understand the role of metal-support interactions and their impact on catalyst performance.
6. Investigating the scalability and long-term stability of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts for potential industrial applications.

These research directions could pave the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions, contributing to the broader goal of utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for valuable chemical production.

This compositional sensitivity highlights the importance of precise catalyst design in tailoring reaction outcomes. For V2O5 catalysts, improved dispersion on the support leads to enhanced performance compared to bulk V2O5, emphasizing the significance of structural considerations in catalyst development [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in CO2-ODH of ethane [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In contrast, V2O5 catalysts can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity but suffer from declining conversion over time, decreasing from 60% to 20% within one 8-hour cycle [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. However, it's important to note that FeNi/CeO2 catalysts show promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC) with ethylene selectivity up to 30% [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

Reaction Mechanisms:
V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In contrast, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. DFT calculations indicate that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

Support Materials:
For both catalyst types, support materials play a significant role. In V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. CeO2 is specifically chosen for its ability to promote active metal dispersion and facilitate CO2 dissociation through its redox properties [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

Composition and Structure:
The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. The mixed FeNi surface is found to be more favorable for the ODEC pathway compared to Ni-terminated surfaces, suggesting that the composition and structure of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining its performance [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

Challenges and Potential for Improvement:
V2O5 catalysts face challenges from acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. However, further research is needed to fully understand their potential for improvement and long-term stability.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there are several promising avenues for future research in CO2-ODH catalysis. The synergistic effects observed in bimetallic FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts suggest that exploring other combinations of transition metals supported on CeO2 or similar reducible oxides could lead to improved catalytic performance. Future studies might focus on fine-tuning the metal ratios and investigating the role of metal-support interactions in determining catalyst stability and selectivity.

Additionally, the differences in reaction mechanisms between V-based and FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts provide an opportunity to develop hybrid systems that combine the best features of both. For instance, incorporating small amounts of vanadium into the FexNiy/CeO2 system might enhance oxygen mobility and further improve selectivity. Computational studies, such as advanced DFT calculations and machine learning approaches, could be employed to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures before experimental validation.

Furthermore, addressing the stability issues observed in both catalyst types remains a critical area for improvement. Developing strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation, such as exploring novel support materials or introducing promoters, could significantly enhance the industrial viability of these catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. Long-term stability studies under realistic operating conditions will be crucial in assessing the practical applicability of these catalytic systems.

Lastly, considering the growing importance of sustainable chemistry, future research should also focus on the life cycle analysis and environmental impact of these catalysts. This holistic approach will ensure that the development of CO2-ODH catalysts aligns with broader goals of green chemistry and sustainable industrial processes.

Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) reactions has gained significant attention due to its potential in valorizing CO2 and producing valuable alkenes. This review focuses on comparing the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

In contrast, vanadium oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres, can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles. However, V2O5 catalysts suffer from declining conversion over time, decreasing from 60% to 20% within one cycle [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. On the other hand, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage. DFT calculations indicate that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

The reducible CeO2 oxide is known for its ability to promote active metal dispersion and to shift easily between reduced and oxidized states, which helps accommodate CO2 dissociation [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

4. Composition and Structure:
The composition and structure of these catalysts significantly influence their performance. The Fe:Ni ratio in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts dramatically affects product selectivity, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favoring CO2-ODH and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favoring dry reforming [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement:

The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms in FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts protects the material by readily removing any coke deposits that form through oxidation [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

While V2O5 catalysts have shown high selectivity, they face issues with stability and potential health concerns. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, demonstrate promising performance and stability, offering a potential alternative to V2O5-based systems.

Future research directions may focus on:
