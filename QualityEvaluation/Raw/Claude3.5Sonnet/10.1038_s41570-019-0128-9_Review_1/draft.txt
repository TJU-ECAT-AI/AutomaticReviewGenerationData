Comparative analysis of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions: Performance, selectivity, and the influence of supports and composition on reaction mechanisms and product formation

The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable production of valuable olefins. This review compares the performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, with vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions, focusing on their activity, selectivity, and the roles of support materials, composition, and structural factors.

1. Activity and Selectivity:
FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, especially Fe3Ni1/CeO2, have demonstrated promising performance in CO2-ODH reactions. Flow reactor results indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high C2H4 selectivity (>75%) in the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In comparison, vanadium oxide catalysts, such as V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres, can achieve up to 90% propylene selectivity. However, V2O5 catalysts suffer from declining conversion over time, decreasing from 60% to 20% within one 8-hour cycle [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

2. Reaction Mechanisms:
The reaction mechanisms of FexNiy/CeO2 and vanadium oxide catalysts differ significantly. V-based catalysts typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where oxygen atoms from the support play a crucial role in improving alkene selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In contrast, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts operate through selective C-H cleavage, with the interaction between Fe and Ni creating distinct active sites that contribute to high selectivity [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. DFT calculations on FeNi(111) surfaces confirm that the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

3. Support Materials:
The choice of support material plays a significant role in the performance of both catalyst types. For V2O5 catalysts, the support affects reducibility, acid-base properties, and dispersion [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 due to VOx-support interactions stabilizing particularly active VOx surface structures [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. In the case of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 as a support is crucial for CO2 activation and helps prevent coking due to its ability to release and recover oxygen atoms [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. The reducible nature of CeO2 promotes active metal dispersion and facilitates CO2 dissociation through its redox properties [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004].

4. Composition and Structural Factors:
The composition and structure of the catalysts significantly influence their performance. For FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, the Fe:Ni ratio dramatically affects product selectivity. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CO2-ODH, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 shows the highest yield of CO (>98% selectivity) through dry reforming [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. The mixed FeNi surface is found to be more favorable for the ODEC pathway compared to Ni-terminated surfaces [10.1016/j.jcat.2016.02.004]. For V2O5 catalysts, better dispersion on the support leads to improved performance compared to bulk V2O5 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

5. Challenges and Potential for Improvement:
Both catalyst types face unique challenges. V2O5 catalysts struggle with acidic sites promoting alkene cracking and health concerns related to V2O5 dust [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1]. FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts show promise in overcoming some of these limitations, offering better stability and resistance to coking. The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms in CeO2 protects the material by readily removing any coke deposits through oxidation [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_1].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there are several promising avenues for future research in CO2-ODH catalysis. The superior performance of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in terms of selectivity and stability, suggests that further exploration of bimetallic catalysts supported on reducible oxides could lead to significant breakthroughs. Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Optimizing the composition and structure of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts to further enhance selectivity and stability.
2. Investigating other bimetallic combinations supported on CeO2 or alternative reducible oxides to discover potentially superior catalysts.
3. Developing strategies to mitigate the decline in conversion observed in vanadium oxide catalysts while maintaining their high selectivity.
4. Exploring the potential of combining the best features of both catalyst types, such as incorporating vanadium into FexNiy/CeO2 systems to create novel trimetallic catalysts.
5. Conducting in-depth mechanistic studies to better understand the role of metal-support interactions and their impact on catalyst performance.
6. Investigating the scalability and long-term stability of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts for potential industrial applications.

These research directions could pave the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions, contributing to the broader goal of utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for valuable chemical production.
