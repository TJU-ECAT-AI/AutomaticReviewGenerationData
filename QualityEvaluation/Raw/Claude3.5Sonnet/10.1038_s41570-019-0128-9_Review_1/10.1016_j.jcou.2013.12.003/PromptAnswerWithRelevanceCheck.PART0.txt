The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on CeO2-ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 for CO2-ODH of n-butane. It does not discuss or compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts to vanadium oxide catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on CeO2-ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 for CO2-ODH of n-butane. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, the question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this literature.

However, the document does provide some insights into the role of support materials, composition, and structural factors for vanadium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions:

1. The CeO2-ZrO2 support exhibited better performance than TiO2-ZrO2 due to its redox properties and oxygen mobility.

2. Vanadium oxide dispersion and interaction with the support play important roles in catalyst activity and stability.

3. The formation of mixed oxide phases (e.g. CeVO4, ZrV2O7) influences catalyst performance.

4. Redox properties of both the support and active metal (vanadium) are crucial for the reaction mechanism.

5. Catalyst deactivation due to coking is a challenge in these reactions.

These insights could potentially be applied when considering the development and optimization of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions, but direct comparisons or specific information about those catalysts are not available in this document.

所给文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或Fe3Ni1/CeO2的具体信息。该文档主要关注以CeO2-ZrO2和TiO2-ZrO2为载体的钒氧化物催化剂用于n-丁烷的CO2-ODH反应。文中并未讨论或比较这些催化剂与FexNiy/CeO2催化剂。因此，无法根据本文献中提供的信息直接回答该问题。

然而，该文档确实提供了一些关于载体材料、组成和结构因素在CO2-ODH反应中对钒氧化物催化剂作用的见解：

1. 由于其氧化还原性能和氧迁移能力，CeO2-ZrO2载体表现出比TiO2-ZrO2更好的性能。

2. 钒氧化物的分散和与载体的相互作用对催化剂的活性和稳定性起着重要作用。

3. 混合氧化物相的形成（如CeVO4、ZrV2O7）影响催化剂性能。

4. 载体和活性金属（钒）的氧化还原性能对反应机理至关重要。

5. 由于结焦导致的催化剂失活是这些反应中的一个挑战。

这些见解可能适用于考虑开发和优化用于CO2-ODH反应的FexNiy/CeO2催化剂，但本文档中没有关于这些催化剂的直接比较或具体信息。

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on CeO2-ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 for CO2-ODH of n-butane. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with FexNiy/CeO2 systems. Therefore, the question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this literature.

However, the document does provide some relevant insights about vanadium oxide catalysts and the role of support materials in CO2-ODH reactions:

1. Vanadium oxide supported on CeO2-ZrO2 (VCZ) showed higher activity and stability compared to TiO2-ZrO2 (VTZ) support for n-butane ODH with CO2.

2. The redox properties of the catalyst significantly influenced the catalytic activity. The CeO2-ZrO2 support facilitated oxygen mobility and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycling, which enhanced catalyst performance.

3. The support material played a critical role in catalyst stability. CeO2-ZrO2 helped prevent coke formation, a main deactivation pathway.

4. Structural factors like high dispersion of vanadium oxide and formation of mixed oxide phases (e.g. CeVO4) influenced catalytic behavior.

5. The reaction likely proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen species.

While these insights are specific to vanadium oxide systems, similar principles regarding the importance of redox properties, oxygen mobility, and support interactions may also apply when considering FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, a direct comparison would require additional studies focused on those specific catalyst compositions.

所给文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2的信息。该文档主要讨论了CeO2-ZrO2和TiO2-ZrO2负载的钒氧化物催化剂用于n-丁烷的CO2氧化脱氢反应。文中没有将这些催化剂与FexNiy/CeO2体系进行比较。因此，无法直接根据本文献中提供的信息回答该问题。

然而，该文档确实提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂以及载体材料在CO2氧化脱氢反应中作用的相关见解：

1. CeO2-ZrO2负载的钒氧化物(VCZ)相比TiO2-ZrO2(VTZ)载体在n-丁烷的CO2氧化脱氢反应中表现出更高的活性和稳定性。

2. 催化剂的氧化还原性质显著影响了催化活性。CeO2-ZrO2载体促进了氧的移动性和Ce4+/Ce3+的氧化还原循环，从而提高了催化剂性能。

3. 载体材料在催化剂稳定性方面起着关键作用。CeO2-ZrO2有助于防止积碳形成，这是主要的失活途径。

4. 结构因素如钒氧化物的高度分散和混合氧化物相(如CeVO4)的形成影响了催化行为。

5. 反应可能通过涉及晶格氧物种的Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制进行。

虽然这些见解特定于钒氧化物体系，但关于氧化还原性质、氧移动性和载体相互作用重要性的类似原理也可能适用于考虑FexNiy/CeO2催化剂用于CO2氧化脱氢反应。然而，直接比较需要对这些特定催化剂组成进行额外的研究。
