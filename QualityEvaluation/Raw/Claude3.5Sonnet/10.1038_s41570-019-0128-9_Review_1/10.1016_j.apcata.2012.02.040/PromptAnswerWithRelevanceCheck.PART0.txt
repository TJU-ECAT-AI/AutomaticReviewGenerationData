Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on SnO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane using CO2 as a soft oxidant. It does not discuss or compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献没有包含关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或Fe3Ni1/CeO2用于CO2-ODH反应的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了以CO2作为软氧化剂，在SnO2-ZrO2混合氧化物上负载的钒氧化物催化剂用于正丁烷的氧化脱氢。它没有讨论或比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂。因此，基于本文档提供的信息无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The text focuses on vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particularly VOx/SnO2-ZrO2, for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane using CO2 as a soft oxidant. It does not provide any comparison with iron-nickel catalysts or discuss CeO2 as a support material. Therefore, the question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2的任何信息。该文本主要关注钒氧化物基催化剂，特别是VOx/SnO2-ZrO2，用于以CO2作为软氧化剂的正丁烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。它没有提供与铁-镍催化剂的任何比较，也没有讨论CeO2作为支撑材料。因此，基于本文档提供的信息，无法直接回答这个问题。
