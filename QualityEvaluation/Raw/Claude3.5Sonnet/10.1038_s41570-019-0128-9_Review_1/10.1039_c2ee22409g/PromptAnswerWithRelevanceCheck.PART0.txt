Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically, nor does it compare them to vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on other catalytic systems and does not discuss the specific catalysts mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in this literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2的信息,也没有将它们与钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中进行比较。该文档主要讨论其他催化系统,并未涉及问题中提到的特定催化剂。因此,仅基于本文献中提供的信息无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information specifically about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 for CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on other catalytic systems and does not mention iron-nickel-cerium oxide catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of these catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts or discuss their performance, mechanisms, and influencing factors based on the information given in this text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的文献中没有包含任何关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或Fe3Ni1/CeO2用于CO2-ODH反应的具体信息。该文档主要关注其他催化系统,并未提及铁-镍-铈氧化物催化剂。因此,我无法基于本文中给出的信息来比较这些催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂,或讨论它们的性能、机理和影响因素。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically for CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses mainly on the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter in various catalytic reactions, but does not discuss the specific catalyst system mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts or discuss their relative performance, mechanisms, or influencing factors based on this literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中的任何信息。该文档主要集中讨论CO2作为软氧化剂和促进剂在各种催化反应中的应用，但并未讨论问题中提到的特定催化剂系统。因此，基于这篇文献，我无法提供FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂之间的比较，也无法讨论它们的相对性能、机理或影响因素。
