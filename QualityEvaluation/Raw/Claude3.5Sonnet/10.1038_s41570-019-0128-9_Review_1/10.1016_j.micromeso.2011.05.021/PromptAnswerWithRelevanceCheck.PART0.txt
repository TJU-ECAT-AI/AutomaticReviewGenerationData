Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2. It does not discuss the catalysts mentioned in the question or provide any comparative analysis of their performance. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或钒氧化物催化剂用于CO2-ODH反应的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了以ZSM-5分子筛为载体的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下进行丙烷脱氢的应用。文中没有提到问题中所述的催化剂,也没有提供它们性能的任何比较分析。因此,无法根据所提供的文献来回答这个问题。
