[1] "FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward the ODEC pathway to form ethylene with selectivity up to 30%."

[2] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage. Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."

[3] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

The literature does not provide enough information to directly compare FeNi/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does provide some insights on FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

1. Activity and selectivity: FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC), with ethylene selectivity up to 30%.

2. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations on mixed FeNi(111) surfaces indicate that the CH bond cleavage pathway is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene.

3. Support material: CeO2 is used as the support material, but its specific role is not discussed in detail.

4. Composition and structural factors: The mixed FeNi surface is found to be more favorable for the ODEC pathway compared to Ni-terminated surfaces, suggesting that the composition and structure of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining its performance.

The document does not provide information on specific challenges or potential improvements for FeNi/CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. More research would be needed to fully compare these catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts and to address their limitations and opportunities for enhancement.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来直接比较FeNi/CeO2催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。然而，它确实提供了一些关于FeNi/CeO2催化剂的见解：

1. 活性和选择性：FeNi/CeO2在乙烷氧化脱氢(ODEC)反应中表现出良好的选择性，乙烯选择性可达30%。

2. 反应机理：在混合FeNi(111)表面上的DFT计算表明，CH键断裂途径在能量上比CC键断裂更有利，导致乙烷优先脱氢形成乙烯。

3. 载体材料：CeO2被用作载体材料，但文中没有详细讨论其具体作用。

4. 组成和结构因素：与Ni终止表面相比，混合FeNi表面更有利于ODEC反应途径，这表明催化剂的组成和结构在决定其性能方面起着关键作用。

文献中没有提供关于FeNi/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中面临的具体挑战或潜在改进的信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面比较这些催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂，并解决它们的局限性和改进机会。
