[1] "FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward the ODEC pathway to form ethylene with selectivity up to 30%."

[2] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage. Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."

[3] "The DFT prediction supports the flow reactor data for the detection of ethylene as one of the major products over the FeNi/CeO2 catalyst in Table 1."

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss the performance of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

FeNi/CeO2 catalysts show promising selectivity towards the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC) pathway, producing ethylene with a selectivity of up to 30%. This selectivity is supported by both experimental flow reactor data and DFT calculations.

The reaction mechanism on FeNi/CeO2 involves preferential CH bond cleavage over CC bond cleavage, as demonstrated by DFT calculations on a mixed FeNi(111) surface. This leads to the formation of ethylene (CH2CH2) as a major product.

The support material (CeO2) likely plays a role in the catalyst's performance, but its specific effects are not detailed in the given literature. The composition of the catalyst (Fe and Ni) is crucial in determining its selectivity towards the ODEC pathway.

Structural factors, particularly the mixed FeNi surface, are important in determining the catalyst's performance. The DFT calculations suggest that the mixed FeNi(111) surface is more favorable for selective CH bond cleavage compared to a Ni-terminated surface.

The literature does not discuss specific challenges or potential for improvement for these catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions. More research would be needed to fully compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts and to identify areas for further development.

该文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。然而，它确实讨论了FeNi/CeO2催化剂的性能：

FeNi/CeO2催化剂对乙烷氧化脱氢(ODEC)路径显示出有希望的选择性，生成乙烯的选择性高达30%。这种选择性得到了实验流动反应器数据和DFT计算的支持。

FeNi/CeO2上的反应机理涉及CH键裂解优先于CC键裂解，这在混合FeNi(111)表面的DFT计算中得到了证实。这导致乙烯(CH2CH2)作为主要产物的形成。

支撑材料(CeO2)可能在催化剂性能中发挥作用，但在给定的文献中没有详细说明其具体影响。催化剂的组成(Fe和Ni)对决定其对ODEC路径的选择性至关重要。

结构因素，特别是混合FeNi表面，对决定催化剂的性能很重要。DFT计算表明，与Ni终端表面相比，混合FeNi(111)表面更有利于选择性CH键裂解。

文献没有讨论这些催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的具体挑战或改进潜力。需要更多的研究来全面比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂，并确定进一步发展的领域。
