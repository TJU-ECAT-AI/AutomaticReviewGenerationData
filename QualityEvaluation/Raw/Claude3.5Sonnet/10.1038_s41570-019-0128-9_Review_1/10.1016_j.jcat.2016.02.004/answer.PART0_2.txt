[1] "FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward the ODEC pathway to form ethylene with selectivity up to 30%."

[2] "DFT calculations predict a different reaction scheme on the mixed FeNi(111) surface. On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage."

[3] "Reducible CeO2 oxide, known for its ability to promote active metal dispersion and to shift easily between reduced and oxidized states which help accommodate CO2 dissociation [21], is used as the oxide support in this work."

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

1. Activity and selectivity: FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC), with ethylene selectivity up to 30%.

2. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations suggest that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to the formation of ethylene.

3. Support material: CeO2 is used as the support due to its ability to promote active metal dispersion and facilitate CO2 dissociation through its redox properties.

4. Composition and structure: The study focuses on a bimetallic FeNi catalyst supported on CeO2, but does not provide detailed information on the optimal Fe:Ni ratio or specific structural factors affecting performance.

5. Challenges and potential for improvement: The literature does not explicitly discuss challenges or potential improvements for FeNi/CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

To fully compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts and address all aspects of the question, additional research focusing specifically on these comparisons would be necessary.

文献中没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。但是，它确实讨论了FeNi/CeO2催化剂的一些方面：

1. 活性和选择性：FeNi/CeO2在乙烷的氧化脱氢(ODEC)反应中显示出有希望的选择性，乙烯的选择性高达30%。

2. 反应机理：DFT计算表明，在混合的FeNi(111)表面上，CH键断裂在能量上比CC键断裂更有利，从而生成乙烯。

3. 载体材料：CeO2被用作载体，因为它能够促进活性金属的分散，并通过其氧化还原性质促进CO2的解离。

4. 组成和结构：该研究主要关注负载在CeO2上的双金属FeNi催化剂，但没有提供关于最佳Fe:Ni比例或影响性能的具体结构因素的详细信息。

5. 挑战和改进潜力：文献没有明确讨论FeNi/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的挑战或潜在改进。

为了全面比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂，并解答问题的所有方面，需要进行额外的研究，专门针对这些比较。
