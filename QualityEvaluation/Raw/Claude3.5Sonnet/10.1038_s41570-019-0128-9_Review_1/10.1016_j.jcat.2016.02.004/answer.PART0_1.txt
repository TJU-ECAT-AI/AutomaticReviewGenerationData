The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC) to form ethylene, with selectivity up to 30%. This suggests it has potential for CO2-ODH reactions.

DFT calculations indicate that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically favored over CC bond cleavage, supporting the experimental observation of ethylene production.

The literature does not discuss the roles of support materials, composition, or structural factors in detail for these catalysts. It also does not mention specific challenges or potential improvements for FeNi/CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

To fully compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts and understand the factors affecting their performance would require additional research beyond what is provided in this literature.

该文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的表现。但是,它确实讨论了FeNi/CeO2催化剂的一些方面:

FeNi/CeO2在乙烷氧化脱氢(ODEC)生成乙烯方面表现出有前景的选择性,选择性高达30%。这表明它在CO2-ODH反应中具有潜力。

DFT计算表明,在混合FeNi(111)表面上,CH键断裂在能量上比CC键断裂更有利,这支持了实验中观察到的乙烯生成。

文献没有详细讨论这些催化剂的载体材料、成分或结构因素的作用。它也没有提到FeNi/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的具体挑战或潜在改进。

要全面比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂,并了解影响其性能的因素,需要进行超出本文献所提供范围的额外研究。
