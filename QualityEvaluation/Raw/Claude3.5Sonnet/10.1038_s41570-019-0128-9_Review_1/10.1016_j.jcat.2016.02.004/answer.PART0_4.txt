The literature does not provide enough information to directly compare Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity (up to 30%) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC) pathway to produce ethylene. DFT calculations suggest that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically favored over CC bond cleavage, promoting ethylene formation.

The CeO2 support plays an important role by promoting active metal dispersion and facilitating CO2 dissociation through its ability to shift between oxidation states. The composition of the catalyst (Fe and Ni) appears to be crucial in determining the reaction pathway, favoring dehydrogenation over reforming.

To fully compare with vanadium oxide catalysts and assess potential improvements, more research would be needed on the specific activity, long-term stability, and detailed reaction mechanisms of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts under various conditions. The literature does not provide enough information to comment on challenges or specific strategies for improvement.

文献没有提供足够的信息来直接比较Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂与钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。但是，它确实讨论了FeNi/CeO2催化剂的一些方面：

FeNi/CeO2在乙烷氧化脱氢(ODEC)路径中表现出良好的选择性(高达30%)，可以生产乙烯。DFT计算表明，在混合FeNi(111)表面上，CH键断裂在能量上比CC键断裂更有利，有利于乙烯的形成。

CeO2载体通过促进活性金属分散和通过其在氧化态之间转换的能力来促进CO2分解，从而发挥重要作用。催化剂的组成(Fe和Ni)似乎对决定反应路径至关重要，有利于脱氢而不是重整。

要全面比较与钒氧化物催化剂的性能并评估潜在的改进，需要对FeNi/CeO2催化剂在各种条件下的具体活性、长期稳定性和详细反应机理进行更多研究。文献没有提供足够的信息来评论挑战或具体的改进策略。
