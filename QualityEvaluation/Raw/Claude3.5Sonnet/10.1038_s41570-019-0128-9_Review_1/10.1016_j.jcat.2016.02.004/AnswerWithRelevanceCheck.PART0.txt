          [1] "FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity toward the ODEC pathway to form ethylene with selectivity up to 30%."

          [2] "On the mixed FeNi(111) surface, as shown in Fig. 8b, the pathway for selective CH bond cleavage (leading to product CH2CH2) is energetically more favorable than the pathway for CC bond cleavage. Thus the mixed FeNi(111) surface is predicted to preferentially dehydrogenate ethane to form CH2CH2."

          [3] "DFT calculated energy profiles on CoPt/CeO2 and FeNi/CeO2 confirm different reaction pathways, consistent with the experimental results."

          [4] "Reducible CeO2 oxide, known for its ability to promote active metal dispersion and to shift easily between reduced and oxidized states which help accommodate CO2 dissociation [21], is used as the oxide support in this work."

          The literature does not provide a direct comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of FeNi/CeO2 catalysts:

          1. Activity and selectivity: FeNi/CeO2 shows promising selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODEC), with ethylene selectivity up to 30%.

          2. Reaction mechanism: DFT calculations indicate that on the mixed FeNi(111) surface, CH bond cleavage is energetically more favorable than CC bond cleavage, leading to preferential dehydrogenation of ethane to form ethylene.

          3. Support material: CeO2 is used as the support due to its ability to promote active metal dispersion and facilitate CO2 dissociation through its redox properties.

          4. Composition and structural factors: The mixed FeNi surface is found to be more favorable for the ODEC pathway compared to Ni-terminated surfaces, suggesting that the composition and structure of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining its performance.

          5. Challenges and potential for improvement: The literature does not explicitly discuss challenges or potential improvements for FeNi/CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODH reactions.

          To fully compare FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts with vanadium oxide catalysts and address all aspects of the question, additional research focusing specifically on these comparisons would be necessary.

          该文献没有直接比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。然而，它确实讨论了FeNi/CeO2催化剂的一些方面：

          1. 活性和选择性：FeNi/CeO2在乙烷氧化脱氢(ODEC)反应中表现出有希望的选择性，乙烯的选择性高达30%。

          2. 反应机理：DFT计算表明，在混合的FeNi(111)表面上，CH键断裂在能量上比CC键断裂更有利，导致乙烷优先脱氢形成乙烯。

          3. 载体材料：CeO2被用作载体，因为它能够促进活性金属的分散，并通过其氧化还原性质促进CO2的解离。

          4. 组成和结构因素：与Ni终止表面相比，混合FeNi表面更有利于ODEC反应途径，这表明催化剂的组成和结构在决定其性能方面起着关键作用。

          5. 挑战和改进潜力：文献没有明确讨论FeNi/CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的挑战或潜在改进。

          为了全面比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂和钒氧化物催化剂，并解答问题的所有方面，需要进行额外的研究，专门针对这些比较。
