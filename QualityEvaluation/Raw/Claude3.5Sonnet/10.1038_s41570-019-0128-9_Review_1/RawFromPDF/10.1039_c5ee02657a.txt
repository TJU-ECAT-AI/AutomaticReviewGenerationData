Catalytic reduction of CO2 by H2 for synthesis of CO, methanol and 
hydrocarbons: Challenges and opportunities  
Marc D. Porosoff,a Binghang Yanb and Jingguang G. Chenb 
Ocean acidification and climate change are expected to be two of the most difficult scientific challenges of the 21st 
century.  Converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is one of the most practical routes for reducing CO2 emissions 
while fossil fuels continue to dominate the energy sector.  Reducing CO2 by H2 using heterogeneous catalysis has been 
studied extensively, but there are still significant challenges in developing active, selective and stable catalysts suitable for 
large-scale commercialization.  The catalytic reduction of CO2 by H2 can lead to the formation of three types of products: 
CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, methanol via selective hydrogenation, and hydrocarbons through 
combination of CO2 reduction with Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions.  Investigations into these routes reveal that the 
stabilization of key reaction intermediates is critically important for controlling catalytic selectivity.  Furthermore, viability 
of these processes is contingent on the development of a CO2-free H2 source on a large enough scale to significantly 
reduce CO2 emissions. 
Introduction 
As atmospheric concentrations of CO2 continue to rise, efforts 
must be put forth to avoid negative effects of climate change 
and ocean acidification.1, 2  Stabilization of atmospheric CO2 
levels requires both significant cuts in emissions and active 
removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.3  Utilizing CO2 in a 
catalytic process to manufacture valuable chemicals and fuels 
is more desirable than sequestration4, 5 because the net 
amount of CO2 mitigated by conversion with renewable energy 
is 20 – 40 times greater than sequestration over a 20 year 
span.6  Additionally, the products of CO2 conversion are value-
added and can be used as fuels or precursors to produce more 
complex chemicals and fuels. 
 
To substantially reduce CO2 emissions by catalytic 
conversion, only reactions which produce fuels or commodity 
chemicals can be considered as viable solutions.  The demand 
for fine chemicals is simply not large enough to effectively 
reduce emissions through a CO2 conversion process.7  For 
example, assuming all fuels and chemicals would be produced 
using CO2 as the feedstock, demand for organic chemicals only 
accounts for 4% of CO2 emissions, while fuels account for 30% 
of total CO2 emissions and 100% of emissions from power 
plants.8  Therefore, conversion to fuels represents a greater 
impact than to specialty chemicals for achieving a substantial 
CO2 reduction.    
Current efforts into CO2 reduction focus on the 
development of highly active, selective and stable catalysts in 
two categories, electrochemical and thermal reduction of CO2.  
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 would most likely operate on 
a smaller scale and is more desirable for localized CO2 
conversion and production of fine chemicals.  There are 
extensive reports regarding electrochemical CO2 reduction, but 
they are outside the scope of this perspective and can be 
found elsewhere.9, 10  Research into catalysts for the thermal 
reduction of CO2 can be further divided into the production of 
three classes of products, CO, methanol (MeOH) and 
hydrocarbons. 
CO produced by reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) offers high 
flexibility because CO can be used in both MeOH synthesis and 
downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) for chemicals and fuels.  
However, RWGS is an endothermic process, which requires 
high temperatures and the conversion is equilibrium limited to 
~23% at 300 °C and 1 MPa.11  Because the maximum 
conversion of CO2 ranges from 10% to 50% from 200 °C to 500 
°C with a 3:1 H2:CO2 ratio, efforts must be put forth to develop 
active catalysts to overcome the slow kinetics and ensure CO is 
produced at the maximum allowable yield. 
CO2 conversion to MeOH is the most direct route for CO2 
utilization because MeOH can be used as a fuel additive, fuel 
substitute and precursor to many commodity chemicals.12  
Although MeOH synthesis from CO2 and H2 is exothermic, CO2 
conversion to MeOH is kinetically limited at low temperatures 
and thermodynamically limited at high temperatures, resulting 
in a low theoretical MeOH yield of 0.06% at 300 °C and 0.1 
MPa.13  In typical industrial MeOH synthesis, CO, H2 and a

small amount of CO2 are reacted over a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst 
between 5 – 10 MPa at 220 – 300 °C.14  Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 has also 
been investigated for MeOH synthesis from CO2 and H2, but 
further improvements are needed to improve MeOH 
selectivity and yield.   
Direct hydrogenation of CO2 can also lead to the 
production of hydrocarbons, including both alkanes and 
olefins.  Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to –CH2– species is 
possible 
through 
dissociative 
adsorption 
followed 
by 
hydrogenation, but the extent to which this occurs is not well 
known.11  Another possible route is direct FT from CO2 and H2 
(CO2-FT) by performing RWGS followed by FT in one reactor, 
which is thermodynamically easier than RWGS because the 
overall process is exothermic.15  The CO2-FT process is very 
attractive because it provides a route to directly produce 
alkanes and olefins from CO2 and H2, but designing catalysts 
that are water resistant with high olefin selectivity is 
challenging.  Out of the three CO2 conversion processes 
mentioned, CO2 hydrogenation to long-chain hydrocarbons is 
the least studied and characterized process.   
In this perspective, each of the three pathways of CO2 
reduction by H2 will be reviewed in the order of (1) CO2 to CO 
via the RWGS reaction over bimetallic and carbide catalysts, 
(2) CO2 to MeOH over Cu-based catalysts and other materials 
and (3) CO2 to hydrocarbons via CO2-FT over redesigned FT 
catalysts.  The perspective will conclude by discussing 
challenges and opportunities for further advancing the field of 
CO2 reduction by H2. 
CO Production through Reverse Water-Gas Shift 
Typical RWGS catalysts consist of well isolated and dispersed 
nanoparticles supported on a metal-oxide to maximize the 
interfacial area between the metal and the support.16  The 
interfacial region is important because both the metal and 
support are involved in the RWGS chemistry.  Two reaction 
pathways have been proposed for CO formation from RWGS.  
One is the redox mechanism, where over Cu-based catalysts, 
CO2 oxidizes Cu0 to generate CO and Cu+ while H2 reduces Cu+ 
to form H2O.17  Further evidence for this mechanism is 
provided by FTIR spectroscopy studies over a Cu/ZnO catalyst 
which indicate CO2 dissociates to CO,18 but formate has also 
been detected over Cu0.19 
The other widely accepted pathway is the formate 
decomposition mechanism in which CO2 is first hydrogenated 
into formate,20 followed by cleavage of the C=O bond.  
Therefore, an effective RWGS catalyst should be dual 
functional with high activity for both hydrogenation and C=O 
bond scission.  Metal nanoparticles supported on metal-oxides 
are popular materials because dispersed metal catalytic sites 
dissociate hydrogen relatively easily,21 which then allows 
reactive atomic hydrogen to spill-over onto the support and 
hydrogenate CO2 that is adsorbed on the oxides.22 
Based on the proposed mechanisms, an active and 
selective catalyst for RWGS should consist of both an active 
metal and metal-oxide support that participate in the reaction 
steps.  Cu-based catalysts, noble metals and catalysts 
supported on CeO2 have been studied extensively.4, 5  Pt-based 
catalysts are generally popular because of their high 
hydrogenation activity, with Pt-Co bimetallics showing higher 
CO production than their parent metals.23  A detailed study 
into Pt-Co supported on MCF-17 with ambient pressure X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and environmental 
transmission electron microscopy (eTEM) reveals that the 
surface is enriched in Pt, explaining the Pt-like selectivity of Pt-
Co.  In comparison with the pure Co catalyst, the addition of Pt 
aids the reduction of Co, shifting the selectivity primarily 
toward CO.24  Details of the activity and selectivity with 
reaction conditions of several representative RWGS catalysts 
are compared in Table 1. 
Although Pt-based catalysts are active and selective for 
RWGS, their high cost is unattractive for large scale conversion 
of CO2.  Fe-based catalysts are promising and show high 
activity and selectivity for RWGS,25 while a bimetallic Fe-Mo 
catalyst has a decreased particle size with higher Fe dispersion 
and improved stability from the formation of a Fe2(MoO4)3 
phase.26  Bimetallic Ni-Mo shows similar behavior to the Fe-Mo 
system27 and NiO supported on mesporous CeO2 shows high 
CO selectivity when the NiO particles are well dispersed on the 
support.16   
While the metallic phase is clearly important for RWGS 
selectivity, the reducibility of the metal-oxide support can 
significantly influence the activity.  CeO2 is a common support 
for RWGS because of its reducibility and high intrinsic activity 
toward CO2 adsorption.  DFT studies indicate that the 
CeO2(110) surface is more catalytically active than (100) or 
(111), likely because the creation of oxygen vacancies is most 
facile on CeO2(110).28  For Pt nanoparticles supported on CeO2, 
temporal analysis of products (TAP) studies with isotopically 
labeled CO2 indicate that the order of H2 and CO2 adsorption 
on the surface is critical.  The presence of Pt improves oxygen 
exchange of CO2 with oxygen defects in CeO2.29  The addition 
of CeO2 to catalysts supported on irreducible oxides can also 
improve activity, as Pd/CeO2-γ-Al2O3 is more active than Pd/γ-
Al2O3 because of the ability of CeO2 to exchange oxygen.30 
CeO2 is clearly a well-studied reducible support for RWGS, 
but other reducible metal-oxides are also promising.  CO2 
binds on In2O3 in a bent configuration and has an exothermic 
energy of adsorption, which contributes to the high activity.31  
Ga2O3 is an active support and can be further improved by the 
addition of CeO2, which enhances the generation of 
bicarbonate intermediates that readily dissociate into CO and 
H2O.32  TiO2 is another reducible support that is active for 
RWGS and it has been shown that Pt/TiO2 outperforms the 
irreducible Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.33

The aforementioned combinations of metal and oxide 
phases require the presence of active and stable interfacial 
regions for RWGS.  In principle, an ideal catalyst should consist 
of one phase that can perform both hydrogenation and C=O 
bond scission to selectively produce CO from CO2.  One 
promising class of catalysts are transition metal carbides 
(TMCs), which have shown desirable behavior for reactions 
involving CO2
41 and properties similar to precious metals for 
many other reactions.42  Perhaps the most interesting TMC for 
RWGS is Mo2C because of its low cost, dual functionality for H2 
dissociation and C=O bond scission, and potential to behave 
similarly to reducible oxides, such as CeO2.39  As compared in 
Figure 1, Mo2C outperforms Pt-based bimetallic catalysts 
supported on CeO2 in terms of both activity for CO2 conversion 
and selectivity toward CO production. 
 
 
Figure 1. TOF (a) and selectivity (b) at 300 °C on bimetallic supported catalysts on CeO2 
(black bars) and Mo2C (dashed line). (Reproduced from ref. 39 with permission from 
John Wiley and Sons.)  
Several mechanistic studies have been performed for CO2 
activation over Mo2C to understand the high intrinsic activity 
towards CO2.  The findings show that CO2 binds to Mo2C in a 
bent configuration and one of the C=O bonds can 
spontaneously break,39, 43 leaving adsorbed CO and O on the 
catalyst surface.  The adsorbed CO can desorb, but the 
adsorbed O, in the form of an oxycarbide (Mo2C-O), must be 
removed by H2 to complete the catalytic cycle.  Because CO2 
activation over TMCs results in oxycarbide formation, the 
oxygen binding energy (OBE) on the TMC surface is an 
important descriptor for predicting high RWGS activity.44  
Future studies of CO2 reduction by H2 over TMCs should 
investigate metal-modified carbides as it has been shown that 
metal can modify the electronic properties of the TMC, thus 
influencing the OBE and possibly product selectivity.40 
Methanol Synthesis 
Currently the CAMERE (carbon dioxide hydrogenation to form 
methanol via reverse-water gas shift) process produces MeOH 
from CO2 and H2 at a capacity of ~75 Mt yr-1.  The overall 
process scheme involves RWGS over ZnAl2O4 followed by

water removal and MeOH synthesis over Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Ga2O3, 
but the disadvantage is that it requires two different catalysts 
and reactors.45  An ideal process should use one catalyst in a 
single reactor, much like current research over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, 
the commercial catalyst for MeOH synthesis from CO and H2.46, 
47  This catalyst has shown varying degrees of CO2 conversion, 
selectivity and space-time yield, as compared in Table 2 with 
other catalysts.  Although Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 exhibits promising 
performance (with a space-time yield up to 7729 gMeOH kgcat
-1 
h-1) under certain conditions (36 MPa and 10:1 H2:CO2 ratio),48 
the pressure is likely too high for economic conversion of CO2.

Similar to the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, Cu-based 
materials are popular choices for MeOH synthesis from CO2;49-
51 however, activity over Cu-based catalysts is structure 
sensitive.  Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) experiments indicate that 
Cu(110) is not intrinsically active for CO2 dissociation,85 while 
other studies show Cu(110) is more active toward CO2 than 
Cu(111) and Cu(100).19  To improve interactions with CO2, 
many researchers have shown that adding promoters can 
significantly improve the CO2 adsorption strength and MeOH 
selectivity.  For example, potassium (K) promoters on Cu/Al2O3 
stabilize 
surface 
intermediates 
and 
enhance 
formate 
dissociation, lanthanum (La) doping on Cu/ZrO2 promotes 
formate hydrogenation to MeOH and inhibits its dissociation 
into CO,77  barium (Ba) promoters inhibit formate dissociation 
and promote MeOH synthesis,53 and adding CaO to Pd/MCM-
41 improves CO2 adsorption and leads to higher CO2 
conversion and MeOH selectivity.54  A similar conclusion is 
obtained over transition metal carbides and those modified 
with Cu and Au.55  Cu and Au nanoparticles supported on 
TiC(001) become charge polarized, which increases CO2 
binding energy, making some of these systems more active 
than traditional Cu/ZnO catalysts.86 
The size of the Cu and ZnO crystallites in Cu-ZnO catalysts 
can also influence the CO2 adsorption strength on the 
catalyst,56 with the catalyst synthesis method playing an 
important 
role. 
 
CuO/ZrO2 
prepared 
by 
deposition-
precipitation has a smaller particle size and exhibits higher 
activity when compared to impregnation or co-precipitation.87  
Catalysts synthesized by the gel-oxalate coprecipitation 
method show a higher interfacial surface area and MeOH yield 
than 
coprecipitation 
with 
sodium 
bicarbonate 
and 
complexation with citric acid.57  On the other hand, a study 
over Fe-Cu/MCM-41 demonstrates that larger particles with 
less metal-support interaction are more favorable for CO2 
hydrogenation to alcohols.58   
In addition to interacting strongly with CO2, catalysts 
should stabilize the desired intermediate for high MeOH yield.  
There are some conflicting studies reporting carboxyl, formic 
acid or formaldehyde as important intermediates.88  Other 
researchers hypothesize that formate is the intermediate over 
Zn-modified Cu(111),89, 90 while infrared studies on Cu/SiO2 
contradict the previous study and hypothesize that carboxyl is 
the intermediate with formate simply acting as a spectator.91  
Furthermore, DFT calculations show that methanol synthesis 
on Cu(111) is more energetically favorable from hydrocarboxyl 
(trans-COOH) than formate in the presence of H2O.92   
An extensive study combining DFT and UHV experiments 
on Cu-based model surfaces confirms that stabilization of 
formyl combined with facile hydrogenation of formate and 
dioxomethylene (H2COO) are critical for high MeOH yield.93  In 
this case, an ideal catalyst should lower the barrier for H2COO 
hydrogenation and exhibit an intermediate CO binding energy.  
Out of several metals supported on Cu(111), Ni/Cu(111) 
exhibits the lowest barrier for H2COO hydrogenation with an 
intermediate CO binding energy, leading to the highest MeOH 
production out of Pt, Rh, Pd, Cu and Au supported on 
Cu(111).94   
It is well established that Cu is an important metal for 
promoting MeOH synthesis, but the reducibility of Cu and the 
nature of the support material can also have a significant 
effect on the catalytic performance.  For example, deactivation 
over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 can be caused by several factors, excess 
surface hydroxyls, Cu sintering, and decreasing catalyst 
reducibility from fixation of Cu in the monovalent oxidation 
state.95  To improve the catalytic activity and selectivity, 
Gracini et al. supported a reducible oxide, CeOx on Cu(111).96  
AP-XPS and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy 
(IRRAS) experiments reveal that the metal-oxide Cu-ceria 
interface directly activates CO2 in the form of an unstable 
carboxylate (CO2
δ–), which is a desirable intermediate and 
opens a new reaction pathway for MeOH synthesis.  The low 
stability of the CO2
δ– species over CeOx/Cu(111) and 
Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) leads to MeOH synthesis rates that are 
significantly faster than those over traditional Cu/ZnO 
catalysts, as seen in Figure 2.

The study by Graciani et al. over CeOx/Cu(111) offers a 
different mechanism from the majority of researchers for 
MeOH synthesis from CO2.97  Most studies propose that the 
first step of MeOH synthesis is the direct hydrogenation of CO2 
through a formate intermediate, while Graciani et al. proposes 
that the overall mechanism is RWGS followed by CO 
hydrogenation to MeOH.  A recent study over Pd-Cu/SiO2 also 
shows that CO produced through RWGS contributes to MeOH 
synthesis.59 
Similar to the study of Graciani et al., DFT calculations over 
Mo6S8, a structural building block of MoS2, show that MeOH

synthesis 
proceeds 
through 
RWGS 
followed 
by 
CO 
hydrogenation to MeOH,98 which is consistent with studies 
over CoMoS.60  Investigations of Rh-based bimetallic catalysts 
indicate that CO is the intermediate,61 with XPS measurements 
over Rh-Co/SiO2 showing a surface enriched in Co; however, 
the more desirable surface is enriched in Rh, which correlates 
with CO stabilization and higher MeOH selectivity.99  
Observations from these studies indicates that the mechanism 
of MeOH synthesis from CO2 is controversial, with researchers 
providing evidence for both formate and CO being the 
intermediates.  
A recent study of low-pressure CH3OH synthesis over 
Au/CeOx/TiO2 model catalysts also indicate that charge 
redistribution over metal particles may play a role.100 The 
addition of CeOx over Au/CeOx/TiO2 leads to increases in both 
CO2 conversion and CH3OH selectivity.  AP-XPS measurements 
reveal that Au is partially negatively charged and CeOx is in the 
Ce3+ state.  The presence of adjacent negatively charged Au 
and Ce3+ sites enhances the adsorption strength of CO2, 
leading to the higher CH3OH yield. 
Regardless of the exact nature of the intermediate, there is 
a necessity for more researchers to take advantage of DFT to 
identify potential descriptors that correlate with MeOH yield.  
By using the BEEF-vdW101 functional, it has been shown that all 
of the relevant energy kinetics of MeOH synthesis can be 
mapped using one parameter, the oxygen adsorption energy 
(ΔEO).  Plotting TOF of CO2 hydrogenation versus ΔEO leads to a 
volcano relationship with Cu/ZnO and Ni-Ga at the peak.  
These two materials exhibit an optimal interaction with 
oxygen, resulting in stabilization of intermediates without 
poisoning the surface.62  As more experimental results become 
available, future studies should continue to use DFT to develop 
descriptors to identify other novel and active materials for 
MeOH synthesis from CO2 and H2.  
CO2-FT for Alkane and Olefin Production 
Another promising route is the direct production of 
hydrocarbons, including both alkanes and olefins, from direct 
Fischer-Tropsch with CO2 and H2 (CO2-FT).  Olefins are 
produced on the order of 200 Mt per year and result in 1.2 – 
1.8 tons of CO2 emitted per ton of olefin produced.15  By 
manufacturing these products with a CO2 feedstock, the net 
CO2 emissions of the process will substantially decrease.  
However, designing active catalysts for CO2-FT is difficult 
because they should be active for both RWGS and FT.  
Thermodynamics suggest that CO2-FT becomes more favorable 
as higher chain compounds are formed because RWGS is 
slightly endothermic and the FT process is exothermic.102, 103  
Furthermore, high conversion of CO2 can only be achieved if 
the FT step is fast enough to overcome the thermodynamic 
limitation of RWGS, which is the main challenge for CO2-FT.104  
Other difficulties with designing catalysts for CO2-FT are that 
(1) CO2 is likely a poison for CO hydrogenation catalysts15  and 
(2) water, an unavoidable byproduct during CO2-FT, is a known 
poison that influences catalyst activity and product selectivity, 
as seen in Figure 3.105 
 
Figure 3. Comparison of model prediction for CO2 conversion (○), C3H6 yield (□), and 
water (▵) in catalytic tubular reactor with water removal, represented by hollow 
symbols and without water removal, represented by solid symbols.  (Reproduced from 
ref. 104 with permission from Elsevier.) 
The most commonly used metals in typical FT with syngas 
(CO + H2) are Fe at higher temperatures and Co at lower 
temperatures.  Generally, when comparing CO and CO2 FT, CO 
conversion (up to 87%) is much higher than CO2 conversion (up 
to 45%),15 indicating that current FT catalysts are not adequate 
for CO2-FT.  Furthermore, in CO2-FT, Co catalysts lead to high 
methane production and a deviation from the Anderson-
Schultz-Flory (ASF) distribution.106  This is further supported by 
a study over Co-based catalysts which shows that CO forms 
typical FT products, while CO2 produces CH4 over Co/SiO2 and 
Co-Pt/γ-Al2O3.107  Therefore, new and improved catalysts 
should be investigated to synthesize typical FT products with 
CO2 as the carbon source. 
Current research into CO2-FT primarily focuses on Fe-based 
catalysts, which yield higher olefins than Co-based catalysts.108, 
109  Fe supported on γ-Al2O3 promotes C2+ hydrocarbon 
formation, while Ni catalysts yield CH4 as the primary 
product.110  The active site of these Fe-based catalysts is under 
intense debate.  Some studies indicate that an iron carbide 
phase is active,111 while others show that the FeO phase is 
active and interacts strongly with the support.112  CO2 
reduction into long-chain hydrocarbons is significantly 
improved with the addition of effective promoters, for 
example, K promoters in Fe catalysts help stabilize the iron 
carbide phase and adding boron (B) leads to light olefin 
formation.113  One hypothesis is that K promotes CO2 binding 
and 
hinders 
hydrogen 
adsorption,114 
which 
leads 
to 
suppressed methane formation and increases the olefin to 
alkane ratio.103  Adding manganese (Mn) in a Fe/γ-Al2O3 
catalyst also promotes long-chain olefin synthesis and 
suppresses methane formation.109

When comparing results from the Fe-based catalysts to 
those of Co and Ni, the CO2 conversion over Fe materials is 
generally higher due to their increased RWGS activity.  
However, it is possible that the active phase in Co-based 
materials is difficult to stabilize under reaction conditions.  In-
situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and XPS 
measurements of Co/TiO2 show that the CoO phase is more 
active than Co metal for CO2 hydrogenation and larger 
particles are more active because they are more easily 
oxidized.122  Traditional FT Co-based catalysts show similar 
intermediates during CO2 and CO hydrogenation according to 
FTIR measurements of a Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, suggesting that 
the hydrogenation pathway might be the same for both 
reactants.  When CO2 and CO are introduced together as feed, 
CO 
hydrogenation 
is 
primarily 
observed 
with 
CO2 
hydrogenation as a minor pathway because of competitive 
adsorption.123  
The future direction of CO2-FT should be focused on 
synthesizing catalysts that are highly active, selective and 
water-resistant in the range of 100 – 300 °C.  It has been 
shown that catalysts synthesized with silica improve stability in 
water, with examples being HZSM-5 zeolite124 and iron-based 
catalysts,125 while the type of support material can prevent 
sintering of the active metallic phase to ensure catalytic 
stability.109  Additionally, carbon composites synthesized 
through deposition of mesoporous carbon by impregnation of 
sugars126 are promising materials as they improve activity by 
increasing metal dispersion and preventing leaching into 
aqueous reaction media.  Because there are several different 
promising synthesis routes and metals for CO2-FT, a facile 
means of rapidly screening new materials with DFT calculated 
descriptors should help develop a new generation of improved 
catalysts. 
Another hydrogenation route, CO2 methanation, is 
appropriate in certain geographical regions.  Although natural 
gas supplies are abundant in the U.S., CO2 methanation is an 
attractive energy storage route for many European nations 
where renewable energy is relatively abundant and CO2 
emissions are regulated.127  Several catalysts have shown 
promise for CO2 methanation, including Ni-Fe,128 Rh/TiO2,129 
Ni/CeO2,118 Ni/CeO2-ZrO2,117 and Ru/γ-Al2O3.119  Supported Ni-
based catalysts are the most promising and well-studied 
systems for CO2 methanation, while noble metal (e.g., Ru and 
Rh) based catalysts show better activity and stability at low 
temperatures.120, 130  Ru/γ-Al2O3 is particularly interesting as 
the catalyst can be treated with cycles of CO2 and H2 and 
remains active after multiple reaction cycles.  Another study 
has shown similar behavior for reduced Ru/CeO2,131  while high 
methane yield (100% at 160 °C) can be achieved on highly 
dispersed Ru nanoparticles supported on TiO2.120  Low 
temperature (25 – 150 °C) CO2 methanation over Rh/γ-Al2O3 
has been reported,130 while high temperature operation is 
required over Pd–Mg/SiO2 (450 °C) 121 and Pd–Ni/CeO2 (300 
°C).23 
Dual-functional materials that can both adsorb and 
hydrogenate CO2 to CH4 are very promising for commercial 
applications.  By combining Ru/γ-Al2O3 with CaO, the catalyst 
can adsorb CO2 from flue gas, then hydrogenate the adsorbed 
CO2 to CH4 when treated with pure H2.132  This type of dual-
functional material shows significant promise for practical 
applications as it can be used directly in a flue gas stream, 
without the need to purify and transport CO2. 
Two primary mechanisms have been proposed for CO2 
methanation.  In the first one, CO2 undergoes C=O bond 
cleavage to form CO, which is subsequently converted into 
methane.  Here, adsorbed surface carbon (Cads) is considered

to be a possible key intermediate.133-135  The second 
mechanism proposes that CO2 is first activated into 
carbonates, which are then hydrogenated into formate and 
subsequently hydrogenated into methoxy species.  This 
mechanism suggests that weak basic sites are required for CO2 
adsorption, which is supported by the higher activity of 
Ni/CeO2-ZrO2 over Ni/SiO2.116  DRIFTS studies by Das et al. 
show that CO2 adsorbs as carbonate species on Al2O3 and MgO 
supports with some formate, which is stabilized by the metal-
support interface.115   
Challenges and Opportunities for CO2 Reduction 
Controlling the selectivity of CO2 conversion by H2 requires 
thorough understanding of the thermodynamics, kinetics and 
key reaction intermediates of the aforementioned three 
pathways.  CO2-FT and MeOH synthesis are both exothermic 
processes, but RWGS is endothermic.  Therefore, the 
temperature regime should be carefully chosen depending on 
the reaction of interest, as shown in Figure 4.  Furthermore, 
for MeOH synthesis and CO2-FT, higher reaction pressures can 
help drive the reaction forward.  Clearly, low temperature 
operation would result in significant energy and economic 
benefits; however, CO2-FT and MeOH synthesis are kinetically 
limited while RWGS is thermodynamic limited under these 
low-temperature conditions.

at 0.1 MPa for a molar H2:CO2 inlet ratio of 3:1.  (Reproduced from ref. 8 with 
permission from John Wiley and Sons.) 
As outlined in detail above, the conversion of CO2 to CO, 
CH3OH, CH4 and other hydrocarbons can occur via several 
possible routes.  Figure 5 depicts some of the proposed 
pathways.20, 88, 93, 97, 115, 116, 136  Along the formate pathways, the 
initial hydrogen transfer to CO2 forms a formate (HCOO) 
species which undergoes series of hydrogenation and 
dissociation reactions to form CH4 and CH3OH.  In contrast, 
along the RWGS and CO hydrogenation pathways, the initial 
hydrogenation of CO2 forms a carboxylate (HOCO) species 
which undergoes dissociation reaction to form CO and OH.  
The CO intermediate then either desorbs or undergoes further 
hydrogenation reactions to form CH3OH, CH4 or other 
hydrocarbons.  
For all three pathways of CO2 reduction by H2, there are 
significant challenges that should be addressed when 
designing active, selective and stable catalysts, as described 
below:  
 
Stabilization of key intermediates 
As described in each section for CO2 reduction by H2, the 
identification and stabilization of intermediates are critical for 
controlling the selectivity for each pathway.  CO is perhaps the 
most important intermediate because catalysts with a stronger 
CO binding energy would favor MeOH93 and hydrocarbon 
synthesis, while a weaker CO binding energy would favor 
RWGS.  For MeOH synthesis, there is more work to be done in 
identifying the correct intermediate(s) and structure-property 
descriptors, but the latest research indicates that stabilization 
of CO is necessary for high MeOH yield.  Identification of other 
descriptors with DFT calculations, such as oxygen adsorption 
energy,62 
adsorption 
configurations 
of 
CO2 
and 
key 
intermediates, and activation barriers for key reaction steps, 
should save a significant amount of time for catalyst screening 
and development.  
 
Utilization of in-situ techniques 
Parallel experiments on well-defined model surfaces are 
critical to support DFT calculations.  However, most of the 
conventional UHV techniques are not very useful due to the 
weak adsorption strength of CO2.  Ambient pressure 
techniques, such as AP-XPS, AP-Temperature Programmed 
Reaction (AP-TPR), and infrared spectroscopy, should be 
utilized 
to 
determine 
the 
adsorption 
strength 
and 
configurations of CO2 and key intermediates.  Furthermore, in-
situ techniques, such as environmental TEM and synchrotron-
based XRD and X-ray absorption techniques, should be 
employed to characterize the electronic and structural 
properties of supported catalysts under reaction conditions.  
 
Identification of low-cost catalysts 
Significant reduction of CO2 emissions requires large-scale 
processes and low-cost catalysts.  These catalysts should also 
exhibit reducible properties, which are an important feature of 
many catalysts for CO2 reduction by H2.137  One promising 
material is Mo2C, which is cost effective, reducible and has 
already been proven to reduce CO2 by H2.39  However, Mo2C is 
not 
ideal 
for 
CO2-FT 
because

intermediates relatively strongly, resulting in coke formation.  
Future efforts should focus on metal-modifications to 
attenuate the Mo2C binding energy of intermediates, much 
like what is seen in a MeOH synthesis study with Cu-Mo2C.55

In all cases of CO2 reduction by H2, the production of large 
amounts of water is unavoidable, leading to catalyst poisoning 
through hydroxyl formation.95  New water-tolerant catalysts 
should be identified that are stable under CO2 reduction by H2 
conditions.  Some promising materials are bimetallic particles 
encapsulated in porous SiO2
138 and carbon shells.139  Recent 
results by Qiao et al. show outstanding thermal stability and 
good recyclability for Pd and Pt particles encased in 
microporous Si shells138 and PtCo has been proven to be active 
for CO2 hydrogenation when encased in SiO2 microspheres.140  
If this SiO2 microsphere technology can be extended from 
precious metals to lower-cost materials, it could be possible to 
design highly active and stable catalysts which repel water.

Development of CO2-free H2 sources 
Currently, 95% of H2 is produced from hydrocarbon based 
feedstocks (steam reforming of CH4, coal gasification and 
partial oxidation of light oil residues), with CO2 as a byproduct.  
A large-scale reduction of CO2 requires sources of relatively 
inexpensive, renewable and CO2-free H2.141  If the cost of 
renewable H2 can be reduced to $2.75 kg-1, fuel from CO2 
becomes cost competitive with gasoline,142 and the production 
of light olefins becomes economically viable.143  Currently 
biomass conversion144 and water electrolysis show promise for 
producing CO2-free H2.  On a large-scale, the latter is likely the 
only suitable source of CO2-free H2 as it does not result in 
other byproducts except O2.137 Although recent studies have 
identified lower-cost electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in 
both 
acid145 
and 
alkaline146 
electrolytes, 
significant 
improvement in overall process cost is needed to produce 
enough H2 for substantially reducing CO2 emissions.  
 
CO2 Reduction by Alkanes 
Alternatively, until CO2-free H2 can be produced on a large 
scale, light alkanes can be used to replace H2 for CO2 
reduction.  Researchers have attempted dry reforming of 
methane to produce synthesis gas, but high reaction 
temperatures (~700 °C) along with rapid deactivation of 
catalysts have prevented breakthroughs.147  Dry reforming of 
ethane, however, becomes thermodynamically favorable 
about 100 °C lower than that of methane, making the process 
more feasible under milder conditions.12  Furthermore, by 
reducing CO2 with light alkanes, it might be possible to 
produce synthesis gas and olefins, both of which are valuable 
products.148  
 
Comparison with Electrochemical Reduction 
Although the current Perspective focuses on thermal catalysis, it 
should be pointed out that significant efforts are taking place in the 
electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, as summarized in recent 
reviews.149, 150  One of the main advantages of electrocatalysis is 
that the hydrogen source for CO2 reduction is from water instead 
from H2 in thermal catalysis.  Some of the current challenges in 
electrocatalysis include the relatively low Faradic efficiency for CO2 
conversion due to the high activity of the competing hydrogen 
evolution reaction (HER).  Product separation might also present a 
challenge if low concentrations of oxygenate products, such as 
methanol and formic acid, are produced in water-based 
electrolytes. 
 
Opportunities 
in 
utilizing 
hybrid 
thermal-
electrochemical approaches should be explored for CO2 reduction.

Conclusions 
In summary, several routes have been explored for CO2 
reduction by H2.  CO production through RWGS can be used in 
down-stream FT and MeOH synthesis, direct MeOH synthesis 
offers a liquid product with many industrial applications and 
finally, CO2-FT produces olefins and alkanes that can be used 
directly as fuels or in the synthesis of plastics, surfactants, and 
detergents.  Currently there is no preferred route for CO2 
reduction by H2 because the specific application ultimately 
dictates which route is the most attractive.  In any event, 
mitigation of atmospheric CO2 is required on a large scale to 
prevent ocean acidification and climate change.  Significant 
efforts must be put forth to both identify new catalysts and 
reduce the cost of CO2-free H2 to make CO2 reduction by H2 
scientifically and economically viable.

Broader Context 
 
Catalytic conversion of CO2 into chemicals and fuels is crucial for mitigating climate change and 
ocean acidification.  Depending on the particular catalyst and reaction conditions, the products 
from the reaction of CO2 and H2 can be selectively controlled.  These products are divided into 
three reaction pathways, reverse water-gas shift (RWGS), methanol synthesis and CO2 Fischer-
Tropsch (CO2-FT).  Understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of the three possible 
pathways is necessary to design new and improved catalysts.  Significant advances have been 
made in catalysts for RWGS and methanol synthesis, but catalysts for CO2-FT require further 
development from the difficulty of understanding this complex reaction pathway.  This 
perspective describes the challenges and opportunities for each of the three pathways and 
concludes with recommendations and suggestions for designing improved catalysts through a 
combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in-situ analytical techniques to 
identify and stabilize key reaction intermediates.  Ultimately, CO2 conversion by H2 also requires 
a CO2-free H2 source, which must be developed together with these catalysts.
