AbstractThe ZrO2 was treated by various molarities of H2SO4 solution (0, 0.5, 1 and 2) then mixed by MgO and
impregnated with 5 wt% of V2O5. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, PSD, EDX, BET and
FTIR techniques. According to the results obtained by characterization studies, the modification of MgO-ZrO2 sup-
port by various molarities of H2SO4 solution had a great impact on the crystallinity, morphology and functional groups
of prepared nanocatalysts. On the other hand, the catalytic activity of synthesized nanocatalysts in the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of ethane to ethylene is affected by the sulfur content on the support. The crystalline structures of MgO
and ZrO2 were confirmed by XRD analysis. The crystallinity of tetragonal ZrO2 was decreased by increasing H2SO4
molarity used in ZrO2 (Sx) synthesising. The highest catalytic performance and ethylene productivity (C2H4 yield of
48% and ethane conversion of 79% at 700 oC) were obtained on the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nanocatalyst. This could be
related to the superior acid-base property, smaller particles, better dispersion of active phase and uniform morphology
of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1).

INTRODUCTION
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is an alternative
route for the production of olefins [1-3]. Restrictions such as high
energy input, coke formation and catalysis deactivation limit the
utilization of traditional ways of dehydrogenation of alkanes. The
petrochemical industry need for the olefins has increased, making
it essential to find an economic and simple route for the produc-
tion of olefins [4-6]. The catalysts used in ODH should have speci-
fications that impede the formation of CO2 and CO [7-9]. Among
the variety of supported metal oxides applied for ODH, the vana-
dium-based oxide showed highest activity and stability [10,11].
However Cr2O3 based catalysts showed comparative performance
with vanadium based catalysts; the formation of nanocrystalline
Cr2O3 and aggregates reduces the chromium surface density and
lowers the active sites needed for ODH process [12]. According to
the literature data, the unsupported V2O5 exhibits lower selectivity
to the ethylene (18-31%) compared to the supported one (29-90%).
This conclusion implies that the strong interaction between the
active phase and the support leads to the formation of different
active sites, which promotes the dehydrogenation reaction [13-15].
The V2O5 atom consists of three types of oxygen. 1- O (a): bonded
to one vanadium atom via double bond. 2- O (b): connected to
two V atoms through bonds with 1.78Å lengths. 3- O (c): linked
to three vanadium atoms with higher bond length compared to V-
O (b). Two V-O (c) bonds have the 1.78Å and the length of the
other V-O (c) bond measured 2.02Å [16]. The simultaneous pres-
ence of V+4 and V+5 ions in the vanadium supported catalysts is
believed to support the selective oxidation of ethane to the eth-
ylene via a redox process [17].
Using the perfect support is important as it affects the active
phase dispersion, reactivity, accessibility and acidity [18-20]. On the
other hand, the mass and heat transfer on the catalysts are directly
related to the material used in the support [21-23]. It is believed
that the nature of support could be altering the V-O-S bond (where
support is denoted by S), and consequently, the ODH performance
of catalysts. According to Lopez-Nieto and coworkers [24], the
existence of a balance between reducibility and the acid-base char-
acter is required for the ODH active sites.
The discernment that sulfated metal oxides, especially sulfated
zirconia, possess an activity for hydrocarbon conversion that over-
steps most or all acidic zeolite catalysts has concentrated great
interest in these materials. Contrary to the extensive studies car-
ried out, the nature of acid sites of sulfated zirconia is argumentative
[25,26]. The application of such an acidic support might precede
the ODH process on the way which leads to the formation of large
amount of CO or CO2 and would lead to carbon deposition on the
catalyst surface. On the contrary, MgO is known as a basic sup-
port that accelerates olefin desorption and prevents the side reac-
tions. The initial activity of MgO for ODH reaction is high due to
the existence of enough oxygen capacity, but the oxygen mobility
of MgO is low. ZrO2 has lower oxygen capacity compared to MgO,

but has the higher oxygen mobility [27]. According to what was
mentioned above, we have proposed that MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) sup-
ported V2O5 has superior activity to the ODH of ethane by CO2.
To the best of over knowledge, there is not any publication in the
field of ethane ODH using MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) composites as V2O5
support. To make this assumption, at the first step, MgO and ZrO2
were prepared by precipitation methods. Then, sulfated zirconia
was prepared by different molarities of H2SO4 solution. V2O5 was
deposited over the supports by a wet impregnation method. The
prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX, BET,
PSD and FTIR analysis. The catalytic activity of synthesized cata-
lysts was investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane
to ethylene under atmospheric pressure employing CO2 as a soft
oxidant and a mixture of CO2 and O2 And the results of these two
conditions were compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Materials
Mg (NO3)2·6H2O and ZrO (NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) were used as
support precursors. NH4VO3 was used as active phase precursor
and was purchased from Aldrich Company. H2SO4 was used as sul-
fating agent and NH4OH was applied to control the pH of the solu-
tions. These materials were used as received and were not purified
further. C2H6 (99.9%), CO2 (99.99%), air (99.999%) and N2 (99.9995%)
were all high purity and were purchased from Technical Gas Ser-
vices in Ajman, UAE.
2. Nanocatalysts Preparation and Procedures
Fig. 1 illustrates schematically the synthesis procedure used for
the preparation of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) nanocatalysts with vari-
ous molarities of H2SO4. The required amount of Mg (NO3)2·6H2O
was dissolved in deionized water and stirred at room temperature.
The ammonia was added dropwise to the stirring solution until
the pH level reached 12. The mother solution was transferred into a
Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and was maintained at 120 oC
for 24h. The aged solution was filtered and washed three times
with cold deionized water, dried at 120 oC for 24h and finally cal-
cined at 600 oC for 4h. For the preparation of sulfated zirconia the
precursor salt, ZrO(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in distilled water
and aqueous ammonia was added until the pH level of the solu-
tion reached 8. The resultant gel was aged in the autoclave at 120 oC
for 24h. The solid product after filtration and washing, dried at
120 oC for 24h. Required amounts of hydrous zirconia were dis-
solved in the mixture of distilled water and appropriate volume of
H2SO4 (0.5, 1 and 2M). This solution was mixed at room tempera-
ture for 2h and afterwards filtered without washing, then it was
dried at 120 oC for 48h, and finally calcined at 600 oC. The obtained
sulfated zirconia solid powders denoted as ZrO2 (Sx), where x is

react with the adsorbed sulfur groups. According to this mecha-
nism reaction (1) takes place during the stirring of a solution con-
sisting of sulfuric acid and Zr (OH)4.

In detail, at the above reaction, protons are attracted to the zirco-
nia hydroxide, and then sulfur anions get ensnared at the ionized
surface of Zr (OH)4. First water molecules desorb during drying
step.
The second stage of reaction occurs during calcinations of Zr
(OH)4 which is treated by sulfuric acid.

This mechanism explains the properties associated with the sulfated
zirconia. The high content of tetragonal phase and higher surface
area are the specification of sulfated material due to the presence
of SO4
2 anion. This mechanism is consistent with ones proposed
by Chen et al. [28]. However, the nature of acid sites of sulfated
zirconia is under debate, but according to the refs. [29,30] incor-
poration of sulfated anions increases the number and the potency
of acid sites. Arata and coworkers [31] suggested a mechanism for
the formation of sulfated zirconia that in addition to the Lewis
acid site, Brnsted sites also detectable. According to the Arata and
coworkers model, the existence of sulfur anion is responsible for
the formation of Lewis sites and the reaction of water with the
adsorbed sulfur species generates Brnsted acid sites [32]. Mort-
the molarity of applied H2SO4 solution. At the final steps, the re-
quired amounts of MgO and ZrO2 (Sx) were dissolved in distilled
water and stirred for 1h, afterwards vanadium precursor was im-
pregnated; then all samples were dried and calcined at 700 oC.
The reaction pathway shown in Fig. 2 has been proposed to the
formation of sulfated zirconia. It seems that the formation of ZrO2
(Sx) consists of two steps. In the first step, superficial hydroxyl groups

erra et al. [33] stated that the amount of Brnsted sites depended
on to the degree of dehydration of catalysis. As a result, the Brn-
sted acid sites are formed due to remaining water on the catalysis.
However, it is not clear that Lewis or Brnsted acid sites are suit-
able for ODH process, but Marta et al. [34] stated that Brnsted
and or Lewis acid sites lowers the olefins selectivity due to the over
oxidation of ethylene. So the drying of catalysts for long time
(48h) and calcinations of catalyst at higher temperature leads to
optimization of acid sites amount.
3. Nanocatalysts Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to assess
structural identification of the nanocatalysts. The XRD patterns
were recorded on a Siemens diffractometer D5000 with mono-
chromatized Cu-K radiation at 40kV and 30mA and a scanning
angle (2θ) range of 20 to 90o and scanning rate of 0.02o/s. The phase
identification was made with comparison to Joint Committee on
Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDSs). Microstructure, particle
size distribution, morphology and surface particle size distribu-
tion of nanocatalysts were examined by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (VEGA\\TESCAN, BSE DETECTOR). The
specific surface area (BET) of nanocatalysts was determined by N2
adsorption and desorption isotherms obtained at 77K using a
Quantachrome ChemBET-3000. Infrared analysis of the nanocata-
lyst was with a UNICAM 4600 FTIR spectroscope addressing sur-
face functional groups in the range of 400-4,000cm1 wave numbers.
EDX analysis was applied by VEGA\\TESCAN, BSE DETECTOR
for elemental analysis.
4. Nanocatalyst Performance Test
Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane was conducted at atmo-
spheric pressure in a 6mm i.d and 200mm length U-shape quartz
tube packed bed reactor which was loaded with 500mg of nano-
catalyst. To attain the isothermal condition and preheat the reac-
tant gas, the particles of catalysts were diluted with quartz sand.
The reactor configuration is shown schematically in Fig. 3. Before
feeding, to enhance the catalyst oxygen capacity and eliminate water
or inorganic compounds existing on the surface of catalyst, a flow
of dry air (consist of <2.5ppm H2O) passed through the catalyst bed
at T=600 oC for approximately 0.5h. Experiments were performed
at temperatures ranging from 600 to 700 oC. A mixture of carbon
dioxide, ethane and nitrogen (feed) at a CO2/C2H6/N2=4/1/5 ratio
was supplied through mass flow controllers (Beijing Sevenstar
Electronics Co., Ltd.) to the nanocatalyst bed at the specified reac-
tion condition. To investigate the effect of O2 addition on the cata-
lytic performance, in addition to the flow of feed gas a flow of air
(in the ratio of feed/air=87/13) passed through the catalyst bed at
a rate of 75cc/min. Compositions of feed and reactor effluent gas
were monitored by a gas chromatograph (GC Chrom, Teif Gostar
Faraz, Iran) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a methanizer and a Car-
boxen-1000 column (Agilent Co.).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Nanocatalyst Characterization
1-1. XRD Analysis
Fig. 4 depicts the XRD patterns of synthesized V2O5/MgO-ZrO2
S(x) nanocatalysts with various concentrations of sulfating agent.
According to the JCPDS files (01-077-2364) the characteristic peaks
related to MgO cubic phase are observed at 2θ =37.0, 43.0, 62.4,
74.8 and 78.7o in all samples. The results illustrated in the figure reveal
that V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S0) consists of both tetragonal phase and
monoclinic one. Recently, Deshmane et al. [35] studied the forma-
tion of zirconia at various calcination temperatures. They con-
cluded that heat treatment of Zr (OH)4 at 600 oC leads to the
formation of a mixture of tetragonal (52%) and monoclinic phases
(48%) of ZrO2. The sulfidation of ZrO2 enhances the tetragonal
phase contribution. However, the calcination of sulfated zirconia at
600 oC leads to the removal of most of the sulfate anions, but the
interaction of remaining SO4
2 with zirconia is reinforced. This
indicates that the presence of sulfate groups does stabilize the tetrago-
nal structure of zirconia, probably due to the strong interactions
between the sulfate group and ZrO2. As can be seen from Fig. 4, by

increasing the concentration of sulfating agent utilized in ZrO2 (Sx)
preparation, the intensity of tetragonal phase decreases and the
structure of catalysts is gradually deformed from crystallite to amor-
phous. It seems that these interactions are suppressing or postpon-
ing the phase transition. It is well known that the tetragonal phase
of zirconia is more active and stable in the ethane ODH. The pres-
ence of tetragonal phase of zirconia decreased the required activa-
tion energy for the reaction [36,37]. No characteristic peaks related
to V2O5 were detected, probably due to high dispersion or small
crystallites of vanadium over the supports in the case of magnesia
supported vanadium oxide; it is believed that the formation of
magnesia vanadate phase reduces the catalysis selectivity toward
ethylene [34]. Hence this phase was not formed in any of the sam-
ples; the acceptable selectivity for all catalysts is anticipated.

1-2. FESEM Analysis
The particle morphology of nanocatalysts is shown in Fig. 5.
Large amount of agglomerate observed on the surface of V2O5/
MgO-ZrO2 (S0) nanocatalysts causes the formation of structure
with fewer interparticle voids and pores and reduces the surface
area of catalysis. Also, this could be related to the formation of
more intense crystalline structure of this nanocatalyst. Comparing
the structure of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S0) and V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S0.5)
reveals that introduction of sulfur anion on the support alters the
morphology of nanocatalyst from leaf shape to the nearly spheri-
cal. This observation is more obvious in the case of V2O5/MgO-
ZrO2 (S1) in which more uniform and approximately more spher-
ical structures are formed. It could be concluded that variation of
sulfating agent concentration in the synthesising of nanocatalysts
has the ability to control the surface particle energy. From Fig. 5,
by increasing sulfating agent concentration, the particle size is
reduced and reaches the minimum amount at V2O5/MgO-ZrO2
(S1) nanocatalyst. By increasing it even more, the particle size in-
creases, but uniformity of catalysts remains unchanged.
Thus, the smaller particle size of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) caused
a better catalytic performance for this nanocatalyst due to avail-
ability of more active sites for ODH reaction. To investigate more
precision, Image-J software was applied to calculate the particle size
distribution of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nanocatalysts, and results are
shown in Fig. 6. According to the results, the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1)
has narrow particle size distribution; and the minimum size of 23.2
nm, maximum of 105.4nm and the average size of 63.644nm were
calculated for this nanocatalyst. More than 70% of V2O5/MgO-
ZrO2 (S1) particles are distributed in the range of particles less than
80nm.
1-3. EDX Analysis
The prepared nanocatalysts were analyzed by EDX to deter-
mine the surface composition of elements present in each catalyst.
The elemental compositions of species are shown in Fig. 7. All the
materials used in the preparation of nanocatalysts (Zr, S, Mg and V)
can be observed in the EDX dot mapping pictures. These results
proved the presence of V species as active phase which are not
detected in XRD patterns. As can be seen, V is dispersed uniformly
on the surface of all catalysts, and the ensembles related to V spices
are not detected. This indicates that Mg-ZrO2 (Sx) is a very good
support for dispersion of V2O5. On the other hand, this proved the
success of precipitation method used for the synthesis of supports.
Our result is in good agreement with XRD analysis that no peaks
related to V2O5 are detected. V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) catalysts have
achieved acceptably good ethylene selectivity in the ethane ODH;
this is mainly due to the ability of isolated vanadium species to
provide lattice oxygen for hydrogen removal from alkanes yield-
ing olefins via redox cycle. According to the literature data, forma-
tion of poly vanadate decreases the ethane conversion. Obviously,
the ratio of V-O-V/V-O-S depends on the vanadium dispersion
[38]. The uniform dispersion of active phase on the support cov-
ered the acidic and basic sites properly and impressed the activity
and selectivity [39,40]. The suitable titration of acid sites by vana-
dium increases selectivity and, on the other hand, makes easier the
access to the active sites. According to Fig. 7, the extent of sulfur
anion in the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) and V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S2) is
approximately twice and quadruple of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S0.5) re-
spectively, which proves the accuracy of synthesizing of catalysts.
1-4. BET Analysis
Fig. 8 shows the surface area of nanocatalysts sulfated by differ-
ent concentrations of sulfuric acid. A drastically higher surface
area was observed upon sulfidation using sulfuric acid compared
to the non-sulfated zirconia. Deshmane et al. [35] applied TGA-
DSC for zirconia and sulfated zirconia with different digestion
times; they concluded that sulfidation of catalysts postponed the
crystallization temperature and so increased the surface area of
catalysts. According to literature, incorporation of SO4
2 ions in the
metal oxides cluster impresses the phase transition from crystal-
lized to the amorphous ones. By increasing the concentration of
sulfate ions, the resistance of catalysts to the transitions increases.
As mentioned in the sulfidation mechanism section, in the first
steps of sulfated zirconia preparation, Zr (OH)4 is formed. Desh-
mane et al. [35] stated that by increasing the digestion time the
condensation of hydroxyl groups increases, leading to the polym-

catalysts, due to the hydration, a strong and broad band in the
3,000-3,600cm1 regions is observed related to physisorbed and/or
possibly coordinated water [42-45]. According to the literature data,
the active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes are either
free or bridging hydroxyl groups [46,47]. Therefore, it can be con-
cluded that the catalysts with more intense bonds at 3,600cm1 are
more active in the ODH of ethane [48]. This bond is more intense
in the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) compared to the other nanocatalysts.
It is expected that V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) exhibits superior activity
in ethane ODH. On the other hand, the hydroxyl groups prevent
the formation of coke. The bonds observed close to 1,620cm1 are
assigned to the bending mode (δ HOH) of coordinated molecular
water associated with the sulfate group. The band observed at
970cm1 can be related to the symmetric vibrations of S-O bond
while 1,050 and 1,150cm1 peaks are attributed to asymmetric
stretching frequencies of O-S-O bonds [49,50]. It was pointed out
that the existence of covalent S=O bonds in sulfur complexes formed
on metal oxides was necessary for the generation of acidic sites.
The peaks around 1,370cm1 are attributed to the stretching vibra-
tion of S=O bonds [51]. As can be seen, by increasing S content the
intensity of this peak increased. These data indicated that molarity
of acid has a significant effect on the nature of bonding of sulfate
ions with the zirconia surface.
2. Catalytic Performance of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 Toward Ethane
to Ethylene
2-1. C2H6 Conversion
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 from 600-
700 oC is drawn in Fig. 10 for synthesized V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (Sx)
nanocatalysts with different concentrations of sulfating agent. As
can be seen, the ethane conversion increases by temperature for all
synthesized samples due to the endothermic nature of ethane ODH
by CO2. Moreover, by increasing sulfur content, the ethane conver-
sion increases. As reported, acid sites are needed for the activation
of ethane [52-54]. In comparison, the ethane conversion is en-
hanced (38%) by sulfidation of zirconia by H2SO4. The first C-H
bond cleavage occurred on the acidic sites. It is obvious that the
acidity of catalyst increases by increasing of sulfur onions bonded
to the zirconia. This statement is in full compliance with FTIR analy-
erization, and a material with three-dimensional porous structure
is formed. Obviously in our work, the concentration of sulfating
agent plays the role of digestion time. The key factor in the sulfida-
tion process is that the sulfidation of amorphous zirconia hydrox-
ide exhibits higher surface area compared to the ones sulfated after
calcination.
1-5. FTIR Analysis
Fig. 9 shows the FTIR spectra for the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) nano-
catalyst prepared by different molarities of sulfating agent. These
spectra have been recorded in the range of 400-4,000cm1 wave
number. The peaks in the range of 400-900cm1 are ascribed to
vibrations of metal oxide bonds [41]. In the FTIR spectra of all

sis that the intensity of peaks related to the S=O increases with sul-
fur content.
2-2. C2H4 Selectivity
The ethylene selectivity of various as synthesized catalysts is
shown in Fig. 11. As can be seen, the ethylene selectivity is decreased
by temperature. As temperature increases, the contribution of side
reaction increases as well. The activation of paraffin is harder than
that of other hydrocarbons due to the high stability of the paraf-
fin. Therefore, the products formed may be readily oxidized under
the conditions required to activate paraffin, thus limiting selectiv-
ity. The extent of ethylene selectivity step downing by temperature
enhancement is related to the strength of acid sites of catalysts.
Moderate acidity of catalysts is commonly accepted as a crucial
factor for achieving acceptable ethylene selectivity. In this case,
superior surface acidity for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S2) and V2O5/MgO-
ZrO2 (S1) in spite of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S0.5) and V2O5/MgO-ZrO2
(S0) is a noticeable factor contributing to their higher conversion
of ethane. However, it has been also well known that stronger sur-
face acidity usually exhibits undesired side-reactions, such as crack-
ing and coking. Due to its highest acid site density, cracking is
noticeable for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S2). On the other hand, the exis-
tence of moderate surface acid site density for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S0)
in contrast to other synthesized nanocatalyst may well account for
its clearly superior selectivity to ethylene. In the case of catalysis
with basic sites, the formed olefins desorb rapidly from the sur-
face of catalysis, and the combustion and the other reactions lim-
ited selectivity does not take palace. The results shown in Fig. 11
reveal that sulfating agent concentration biases the ethylene selec-
tivity. It is obvious that the strength of acid sites proliferates by
concentration of H2SO4.
2-3. C2H4 Yield
Fig. 12 exhibits ethylene yield on the as-synthesised nanocatalysts
in the range of 600-700 oC. The results illustrated in the figure reveal
that by increasing H2SO4 concentration, the ethylene yield increases
and reaches its maximum for the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1). Further
increasing of sulfating agent concentration leads to a decrease in
the ethylene yield. The affinity between ethane and active sites
determines the ethylene productivity. The interaction between cat-
alyst and hydrocarbons is related to the acid-base property, sur-
face of metal oxide and vanadium dispersion. According to the
literature [55] data, the electron density and the cation size specify
the strength of acid sites. The more oxidized cation provides more
acidic sites and inversely the cation with low density of electrical
charge is known as basic sites. Busca et al. [56] calculated the charge
of most active H atoms of hydrocarbons. They concluded that
alkanes which are heavier than ethane have negative charge on H
atom; thus, acidic sites are favorable for the dehydrogenation pro-
cess. In the case of ethane, H atom of C-H bond has nearly posi-
tive charge. But there are inconclusive data in the literature about
the nature of acidic or basic site required for ethane activation. In
this study, the results of ethane conversion section indicate that by
the enhancement of acidity of the catalyst, activity of the dehydro-
genation increased; on the other hand, by increasing sulfating agent
molarity used in catalysis preparing the selectivity of ethylene de-
creased. From the above results, we propose that in the case of
vanadium supported on the MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) nanocomposites, acidic
sites are required for ethane conversion, but more basic sites are
needed for ceasing of over oxidation reaction, which limits selec-
tivity. Note that ethylene yield over V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nano-
catalysts is 52% at 700 oC, which is higher than the other studied
catalysts. This is due to better acid base property, well defined and
uniform morphology.
2-4. Effect of O2 Addition
To specify the contribution of O2 to the reaction, the ethane de-
hydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was compared with that con-
dition which CO2 and O2 utilized simultaneously as oxidant at 650 oC
over V2O5/MgO-ZrO2(Sx); the results are shown in Fig. 13. The
ethane conversion and ethylene yield on the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (Sx)
catalyst in the presence of O2 is higher than that in the presence of
only CO2, boding the promoting effects of O2 for the oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane. For the V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) nano-
catalyst the ethane conversion and ethylene yield in the presence
of O2 increased 47% and 15%, respectively, while ethylene selectiv-
ity decreased approximately 24%. The activation of oxidant depends
on its nature and is one of the key steps in proceeding ODH reac-
tion. The activity of CO2 is low and its activation is nearly hard

and needs higher temperatures. Compared to CO2, O2 is activated
at lower temperatures. In the case of our study, the presence of
vanadium as a reducible metal oxide accelerated the O2 activation
at lower temperatures. Moreover, by comparing two cases, eth-
ylene selectivity is higher in the absence of O2. Thus, CO2 is less
aggressive than O2, so the occurrence of side reactions is limited
by utilization of only CO2. Regarding the high heat capacity of
CO2, it could reduce the probability of hot spot formation [57]. It
is believed that these spots are responsible for the overoxidation
reaction, which lowers the ethylene selectivity. As mentioned above,
by applying suitable proportion of O2 and CO2, one can overcome
the dangers related to O2 and lower activity pertinent to CO2.
2-5. Time on Stream Performance
The catalytic activity of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) sample was tested
for 300min time on-stream, and the results are shown in Fig. 14.
According to the ethylene yield data, maximum amount of eth-
ylene was produced at 700 oC; thus, this temperature was selected
for the investigation of deactivation of V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (Sx)
nanocatalyst. As can be seen, the conversion, selectivity and eth-
ylene yield remained constant after 6h. These results indicate that
V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) is an active and stable catalyst for ethane
ODH. This could be due to the proper acidity and Mg/Zr ratio
utilized for the nanocatalyst preparation. On the other hand, the
presence of ZrO2 in the support reinforces the thermal stability of
catalysts. The deactivation of ethane ODH catalysts mainly takes
place due to the coke formation or diminishing of redox species.
According to the FTIR results, existence of very intense peaks is
related to the OH groups, which prevents coke formation. On the
other hand, the surface area of prepared nanocatalysts is high enough
to disperse vanadium properly and rule up the coke formation.
3. Reaction Mechanism of Ethane to Ethylene
A reaction mechanism for ODH of ethane was suggested; a sche-
matic diagram of this mechanism is shown in Fig. 15. It is obvi-
ous that the adsorption of reactant on the surface of catalysis is the
beginning step of all catalytic processes. Ethane could be adsorbed
on the O (a) and O (b) sites of V2O5 supported catalysts. Fu et al.
[58] concluded that the adsorption of alkanes on the O (b) sites is
much stronger than on the O (a). The first C-H bonds of alkanes
could be dissociated hemolytically or heterogeneously. The hetero-
lytic cleavage of C-H bonds taking place on the surface possesses
strong acid-base pairs. The products of this dissociation are ethyl
radical and a proton, while the heterogeneous dissociation was
done on the surface oxygen sites.
Chen et al. [59] proposed a model for activation of C-H bond
that only lattice oxygen contributes without the aim of vanadium
atom. According to the reaction which is given below, Fu et al. [58]
attributed a mechanism in which vanadyl groups play an import-
ant role.
C2H5-H+V=OHV=OC2H5
(3)
C2H5-H+V=OC2H5V=OH
(4)
They claimed that reaction (3) requires high energy and the prod-
ucts of reaction (4) are not stable. These restrictions make the oc-
currence of heterogeneous cleavage of C-H bond unlikely. The
hemolytic dissipation of C-H bond is explained by reaction (5)
C2H5-H+O+OHO+OC2H5
(5)
Two lattice oxygens are involved in this reaction. Three different
paths are included in reaction (5):

i. Formation of alcohol via the reaction of O atoms with C-H
bonds and at the next step, proton of alcohol migrates to the neigh-
bor lattice oxygen.
ii. Ethane simultaneously reacts with two lattice oxygen.
iii. Similar to path 1, this is a two-step mechanism.
In the first step lattice oxygen abstracts one H atom; and then
the formed ethyl groups are released to the gas phase and finally
react with the other lattice oxygen. In the hemolytic dissociation of
C-H bond, three types of oxygen and three different mechanisms
are applicable. Since the cleavage of C-H bond via O (c) produces
unstable intermediates, this site is emitted from the mechanism
investigation. Bader et al. computed the net charge distributed on
the O (a), O (b) and O (c) and found that the higher reducibility is
a concern to the O (a) sites. On the other hand, it seems that O (b)
has better contact with C-H bond compared to O (a) [60]. Because
O (b) is linked to more species than O (a), the electrons concen-
trated on these nearby atoms could help in the activation of C-H
bonds. As mentioned, the reducibility of O (a) site is more than
O (b). Mechanism 1 requires more reducible sites compared to 3.
Therefore, it is concluded that O (a) is favorable for both mecha-
nisms, while on the O (b) only mechanism 3 is viable.
At the next step, the adsorbed ethoxide should be converted to
ethylene. This step takes place on the O (b) sites where the neigh-
boring oxygen adsorbs the second H atom.
CONCLUSIONS
Interesting effects of various contents of SO4
2 ion introduction
to the MgO-ZrO2 combined support were investigated. The results
confirmed that SO4
2 ion changed the support character and activ-
ity in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene. The mono-
clinic phase of zirconia approximately disappeared after sulfidation
of the MgO-ZrO2 combined support. Also, the crystallinity of
tetragonal phase of ZrO2 decreased by increasing the sulfur con-
tent used for MgO-ZrO2 (Sx) preparation. On the other hand, the
introduction of SO4
2 ion led to the formation of three-dimen-
sional porous structures and enhanced the surface area of nano-
catalysts and impressed the interaction between support and active
phase and dispersion of vanadium. The FTIR results revealed the
S=O bonds, which indicate the acidity of nanocatalysts, increased
by increasing sulfur content of support. The uniform and small
particle size was observed for V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1). Among the
studied nanocatalysts, V2O5/MgO-ZrO2 (S1) showed superior cat-
alytic activity at 700 oC giving 52.03% ethylene yield due to uniform
morphology, small particle size and suitable acid-base property.
