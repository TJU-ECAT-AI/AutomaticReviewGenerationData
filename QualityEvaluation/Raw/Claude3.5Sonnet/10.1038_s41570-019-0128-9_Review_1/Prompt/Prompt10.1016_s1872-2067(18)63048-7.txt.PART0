The nVMCM41 catalysts were prepared by onestep hydrothermal synthesis and applied to the 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the presence of CO2. Several stateoftheart char
acterization methods were performed to explore the correlation between catalytic performance and 
the physicochemical characterizations of the catalysts. Because moderate amounts of V species 
were introduced into the framework of MCM41, the catalyst maintained a large specific surface 
area, a highly ordered mesoporous structure, and highly dispersed V active sites (monomeric and 
dimeric V oxide species), while the highvanadiumdoping catalysts caused an enhancement in the 
number of acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites. The ODHP reaction showed that the 6.8VMCM41 (V 
content 6.8 wt%) catalyst exhibits high activity and stability, and the C3H8/CO2 molar ratio (1:4) was 
suitable. The promoting effect of CO2 on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ODHP was demonstrated 
as the reaction coupling mechanism and lattice oxygen mechanism.

1.  Introduction 
Propene is an important petroleum chemical raw material, 
used mainly in the production of substances such as polypro
pene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, butanol, octanol, and propene 
oxide. In recent years, the demand for propene has increased 
markedly because polypropene has become one of the most 
important generalpurpose plastics. Propene is generally 
coproduced with ethylene by the steam cracking of naptha and 
with gasoline by the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) of gaso
line. These processes are carried out at high temperatures with 
low propene selectivity and inevitable coke formation [1,2]. 
Therefore, it is urgent to find a new technology with less energy 
intensive processes for propene production [35]. 
Many studies dealing with the oxidative dehydrogenation 
(ODH) of light alkanes have been recently reported, with oxi
dants such as O2, N2O, and CO2. Kondratenko et al. [6,7] report
ed that VOx/γAl2O3 and VOx/MCM41 showed high propene 
selectivity in ODH of propane (ODHP) with N2O as an oxidant. 
However, industrialization would be hindered by the deep oxi
dation of propane and products or by the high cost of N2O [8,9]. 
CO2 acting as a single mild oxidant, which can effectively in
hibit deep oxidation and improve the stability of the catalyst, 
has been widely used in propane dehydrogenation by many 
researchers. Moreover, the dehydrogenation reaction coupled 
with the reverse watergas shift reaction is an attractive ap
proach to improve the equilibrium conversion in the ODHP 
process [10]. Previous work indicated that CO2 was advanta
geous for maintenance of the metal active sites in a high oxida
tion state for an NiMoO4 catalyst [11]. Nakagawa et al. [12] and

Fukudome et al. [13] reported that the use of CO2 as an oxidant 
markedly promoted the dehydrogenation of propane over the 
oxidized diamondsupported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts  and 
over the lattice oxygen of V oxide. 
Ordered mesoporous materials are widely employed in the 
fields of catalysis, adsorption, and biochemistry. The high sur
face area of ordered mesoporous materials allows the poten
tially efficient dispersion of active sites, and the uniform pore 
size in the mesoporous range favors the diffusion of bulky 
molecules. Among them, MCM41 has been widely used since it 
was first reported in 1992 by Mobil Oil Corp. [14,15]. However, 
MCM41 in its pure siliceous form shows limited applications in 
catalytic organic transformations due to a lack of active sites 
[16,17]. Hence, modification is necessary, which is achieved by 
incorporating active components into the MCM41 framework. 
Many metals have been incorporated into the MCM41 frame
work. V has been verified as the active and selective active cen
ter in ODHP [1820]. Shylesh et al. [18] reported that Vbased 
catalysts displayed excellent activity toward the epoxidation 
reaction of bulkier olefins. The VMCM41 samples also showed 
good catalytic performance for the selective oxidation of sty
rene using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant [16]. 
Metalmodified mesoporous silica can be synthesized by ei
ther a onestep cocondensation method or postsynthesis 
treatment. With the onestep method, the active species can be 
directly incorporated into the pore channels and are better 
dispersed compared with the impregnation method, contrib
uting to higher catalytic performance. 
The reaction mechanism of ODHP by V oxide catalysts sup
ported on silica was examined by densityfunctional theory 
(DFT) [19,21]. The active sites are the highly dispersed VOx 
species, which can be classified as monomeric and 
twodimensional oligomeric V oxide species below the mono
layer coverage [2224]. The reaction involved twohydrogen 
abstraction [19]. Singlecrystal V2O5 (001) was not a good cata
lyst because the terminal O was too active to release the pro
pene [20], and the bulk V2O5 crystallites of threedimensional 
particles exhibited low catalytic activity. Therefore, it is ex
pected that V oxide species can be tuned by controlling the 
extent of their polymerization. 
The aim of this work is to synthesize and characterize 
nVMCM41 mesoporous molecular sieves and investigate the 
effects of different V amounts in ODHP in the presence of CO2. 
The nVMCM41 catalysts were prepared by a onestep hydro
thermal synthesis. The framework structure, texture, thermal 
stability, and hydrothermal stability of nVMCM41 materials 
were investigated. The selective oxidation of propane was 
conducted to investigate the potential catalytic applications of 
the nVMCM41 sample, and it showed good stability. 
2.  Experimental 
2.1.  Catalyst preparation 
The catalyst was synthesized by a onestep hydrothermal 
method using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the silica 
source and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the 
template. The synthesis steps are as follows. In a typical pro
cess, a certain amount of NH4VO3 (0.170.95 g) was dissolved 
in 30 mL of deionized water, and 2.5 g of CTAB and 0.4 g of 
NaOH were dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water. After com
plete dissolution, the NH4VO3 solution was added to the tem
plate solution under mechanical stirring. After approximately 
30 min, 16.8 mL of TEOS was added dropwise to the mixed 
solution under mechanical stirring. After stirring for 4 h at 60 
C, the synthesis gel was cooled overnight and then transferred 
into a Teflonlined autoclave and aged at 120 C for 48 h. The 
obtained materials were centrifuged, washed five times, dried 
at 60 C for 12 h, and then calcined at 550 C for 4 h. The sam
ples were denoted nVMCM41, where n represents different 
amounts of V doping varying from 1.9 to 10.6 wt% (ICP re
sults). 
2.2.  Catalyst characterizations 
The V and Si contents in nVMCM41 were recorded using 
ICPAES with a Varian Vista MPX. 
The Xray diffraction (XRD) patterns of nVMCM41 cata
lysts were collected on a BraggBrentano diffractometer 
(D/Max2000, Rigaku Corp., Japan) with monochromatic Cu Kα 
radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The samples were scanned from 2θ 
values of 10 to 60 with a scan speed of 5/min and from 0.5 
to 6 with a scan speed of 0.5/min. The Xray tube was manip
ulated at 40 kV and 30 mA. 
The specific surface area, total pore volume, and average 
pore diameter were measured at 196 C by the N2 adsorp
tiondesorption method with an automatic analyzer (NOVA 
4000, Quantachrome, Inc., USA). The samples were degassed in 
a vacuum at 300 C for 4 h prior to analysis. The specific surface 
area was calculated using the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) 
method. The total pore volume was calculated from the amount 
of vapor adsorbed at a relative pressure (P/P0) close to unity. 
Poresize distributions were obtained using the Bar
rettJoynerHalenda (BJH) model. 
Fourier transforminfrared (FTIR) spectra of the catalysts 
were measured using the KBr wafer technique in a Nicolet 
3800 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Corp., USA). The IR spectra 
were recorded in the range 4000400 cm1. 
Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin Yvon confocal 
laser Raman system (SuperLabRam II), which was equipped 
with a HeNe laser at 632.8 nm with a power of approximately 
5 mW. Each spectrum was obtained by three accumulations, 
and the acquisition time was set at 30 s. 
Ultravioletvisible (UVvis) spectra of the catalysts were 
recorded by the diffuse reflectance technique using a spectro
photometer (MPC3100, Shimadzu, Corp., Japan) in the range 
200600 nm, using BaSO4 as the reference. 
Fieldemission scanningelectronmicroscopy (FESEM) im
ages of the catalysts were obtained for the analysis of the mor
phologies of surface particles of mesoporous samples using an 
S4800 scanning electron microscope. 
Transmissionelectronmicroscopy (TEM) investigations of 
nVMCM41 catalytic materials were performed for morpholo
gy determinations on a JEM2010 fieldemission transmission

electron microscope operated at 200 kV in a vacuum. 
Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze 
the bindingenergy values and atomic surface concentration of 
metal. The XPS measurements were recorded on a Per
kinElmer PHI 5000C ESCA Xray photoelectron spectrometer 
using Al Kα radiation. All samples were reduced in situ under 
an H2 atmosphere at 580 C for 2.5 h to improve the dispersion 
of the surface V species. The samples were calibrated using the 
C 1s binding energy at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. 
Temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) of NH3 and 
CO2 measurements was implemented to analyze the acidity and 
alkalinity of the catalysts. The sample (0.1 g) was pretreated 
at 400 C for 1 h under a helium flow (30 mL/min) before being 
cooled to 120 C and saturated with adsorbed gas. After NH3 
adsorption, the sample was purged with He for 15 min. During 
desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was em
ployed to record the TPD profiles from 120 to 800 C, with a 
heating rate of 10 C /min. 
Temperatureprogrammed reduction (TPR) experiments 
were carried out for the catalysts in a programmable tempera
ture system. The H2 TPR analysis was tested on a 
Quantachrome IQ system. The sample (0.1 g) was filled in a 
quartz 
reactor, 
which 
was 
heated 
in 
a 
tempera
tureprogrammed furnace from room temperature to 800 C 
(10 C /min). The reducing gas was a mixture of H2 and Ar gas 
(10% H2). The H2 consumption as a function of the reduction 
temperature was continuously monitored with a TCD cell and 
recorded. 
The samples used for thermogravimetric (TG) analysis were 
dried at 50 C in air. TG analysis of the catalysts was performed 
on a Shimadzu DTG60H thermogravimetric analyzer. The 
sample (0.0030.005 g) was kept under a N2 atmosphere. The 
temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 C 
at a rate of increase of 20 C /min. 
2.3.  Catalytic tests for ODHP reactions 
Catalytic tests were performed in a fixedbed quartz reactor, 
which was packed with 0.2 g of catalyst with silica wool at at
mospheric pressure. The temperature in the fixed bed of cata
lyst particles was monitored with an axially movable thermo
couple located inside a quartz capillary. The feed flow consisted 
of C3H8, CO2, and Ar (C3H8/CO2/Ar molar ratio 1/4/4, WHSV = 
1.0 h1). The reaction temperature was controlled at 600 C. 
The products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC, 
SP6980). After the reaction, the reactor was cooled to room 
temperature with pure Ar. The gaseous products (CO and CO2) 
were detected by an online TCD and the other products (CH4, 
C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) by an FID chromatographic system. 
The conversion of propane, the selectivity of propene, and the 
conversion of CO2 were calculated as follows:

3.  Results and discussion 
3.1.  Mesoporous structure of nVMCM41 samples 
The smallangle XRD patterns of nVMCM41 catalysts are 
shown in Fig. 1(a). One intense peak at 2θ  2 is due to the 
reflection from the (100) plane of MCM41. Apart from this, 
two weak peaks are found in the 2θ range of approximately 4 
and can be assigned to the (100) and (200) planes, indicating 
that longrange order of this mesoporous structure is obtained 
[25]. With the loading of V in the samples, the intensity of the 
diffraction peaks decreases, and the main peak is widened, 
which could affect the ordered pore network of the samples or 
lead to a decrease in their crystallinity. As shown in Table 1, 
there is an increase in unitcell parameter (a0) owing to the 
replacement of Si4+ (Pauling radius 42 pm) by V5+ (Pauling ra

dius 54 pm) as reported in the literature [16,26]. When the V 
concentration reaches 10.6 wt%, the pore structure of MCM41 
is partially destroyed. This may be due to bulk V oxides block
ing the molecular sieve pores and/or to partial collapse of the 
pore structure. 
Figure 1(b) shows the wideangle XRD patterns of V2O5 
samples and nVMCM41 catalysts with varied V contents. In 
contrast, the samples below 8.8 wt% V content show no char
acteristic peaks of V2O5, suggesting that the V species at low 
concentrations still exists in an amorphous state, and that V 
species may be incorporated into the silicate framework or 
highly dispersed on the surface of mesoporous channels, while 
the 10.6VMCM41 sample shows diffraction peaks of V2O5. It 
can be concluded that the V content is the key factor that de
termines whether aggregation or formation of bulk V2O5 crys
tallites occurs. 
The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 2. 
Typical typeIV isotherms are observed. The capillary conden
sation shows a sharp increase in the relative pressure (P/P0) of 
approximately 0.4 for all nVMCM41 catalysts, suggesting typ
ical mesoporous structure with uniform pore diameter, and the 
overall mesoporous structure is well maintained after the addi
tion of V species. 
The physical properties, including the specific surface areas 
(ABET), pore diameters (dp), and pore volumes (Vp) of 
nVMCM41 and pure MCM41 are listed in Table 1. ABET and Vp 
decrease when an increasing amount of V is incorporated, 
while dp maintains a relatively stable size. These behaviors can 
be ascribed to the formation of Vcontaining species in the 
pores, which expand the pore structure [19]. When the V con
centration increases to 10.6 wt%, ABET decreases significantly, 
which can be attributed to the formation of V2O5 nanoparticles 
in the pore system, which block the channels; this is consistent 
with the following Raman spectroscopy results. 
3.2.  Physicochemical characterizations of nVMCM41  
catalysts 
The FTIR spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3; the 
absorption bands at 802 and 1078 cm1 over all the catalysts 
are the SiOSi external asymmetric stretching vibration and 
external symmetric stretching vibration [27], respectively, in
dicating that the silica framework remains unaffected in terms 
of V doping. The bands at 458 and 565 cm1 are due to the 
SiOSi internal tetrahedron vibration absorption peak. The 
bands at around 1635 and 3465 cm1 are attributed to the 
bending vibration of water molecules and the existence of an 
organic template (CTAB) [28,29]. The characteristic peak of 
SiOV bonding at 960 cm1 is obscured by the strong SiOSi 
vibrational band of nVMCM41 [27], which can be taken as

proof of the incorporation of V atoms in the VMCM41 frame
work [30,31]. The difference between nVMCM41 catalysts 
and pure MCM41 will be further discussed below. 
Raman spectra clearly reveal the differences in nVMCM41 
catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4. All the samples have weaker Ra
man bands at 488, 600, and 836 cm1, which are attributed to 
the SiO2 support [32]. The band at 1023 cm1 appears in all 
samples, except for pure MCM41, and is assigned to the V=O 
stretching vibration of isolated monovanadate VO43 [31]. With 
the increase in V loading, the peak intensity at the 1023cm1 
band increases obviously, and new bands appear gradually at 
144, 283, 303, 405, 482, 525, 702, and 997 cm1, which corre
spond to V2O5 crystallites [32,33]. The sample containing 6.8 
wt% V loading has no peak at 997 cm1, which is attributed to 
highly dispersed VO43 and the absence of V2O5 crystallites. 
With the increase in V loading (8.8 and 10.6 wt%), the peak 
intensity at 997 cm1 increases strongly since V2O5 crystallites 
gradually accumulate and cover the VMCM41. In particular, 
the catalysts above 6.8wt% V loading show additional signals 
at 997 cm1, and the peak intensity at 1023 cm1 for the 
6.8MCM41 catalyst is stronger than the catalysts with lower V 
contents. It is obvious that the 6.8VMCM41 catalyst has better 
V dispersion than the others, which is consistent with the XPS 
results. 
Figure. 5 shows the UVvis spectra of nVMCM41 catalysts. 
The presence of intense absorption bands at 261 nm is associ
ated with the VOV characteristic absorption band, which is 
likely due to the dd charge transfer belonging to highly disper
sive tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species incorporated into the 
silicate framework [34]. The bands at approximately 376 nm 
are assigned to extraframework V5+ species in distorted octa
hedral coordinations [35]. The weak absorption bands at 690 
nm also indicate the formation of polymeric VOV bonds, and 
dehydrated samples do not have this band [23,31]. The crystal
line V2O5 exhibits UVvis absorption over a broad spectral 
range (220600 nm), with an instance of V2O5 crystal phase in 
the samples [36]. Therefore, the samples of less than 8.8wt% V 
doping suggest the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated V, 
whereas the higher V doping (10.6 wt%) contains a large 
amount of V2O5 or pentahedrally coordinated V, which is con
sistent with the wideangle XRD results. 
The XPS technique was applied to analyze the chemical state 
of elements and the surface composition of the nVMCM41 
catalysts. Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra of three representative 
samples. The bands at 515.9 and 517.4 eV of the V 2p3/2 binding 
energies (BEs) can be assigned to V3+ and V5+, respectively. The 
band at 518.8 eV is attributed to highly dispersed isolated 
VO43 [31]. As can be seen in Table 2, the peak area percentage 
at 518.8 eV attains a maximum value of 43% for 6.8VMCM41, 
indicating that the sample has better V dispersion than others.

This result is consistent with the results of the wideangle XRD 
and Raman analyses. Compared with Table 1, the Si/V molar 
ratio of the VMCM41 sample determined by XPS (obtained 
from the surface) is much higher than that determined by ICP, 
which indicates that most VOx species tend to disperse in the 
silicate framework instead of the support surface. 
The TG curves of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 7. The 
weight loss at approximately 100 C can be ascribed to the loss 
of surface water, and the weight loss between 200 C and 450 
C can be assigned to the decomposition of residual template 
surfactant [37], which results from the association of 
C16H33(CH3)3N+ with SiO groups from the surface of the inor
ganic wall [38]. The weight loss between 450 and 600 C is 
attributed to the loss of residual template agent connecting to 
the center of SiOV [39,40], and that above 600 C is consid
ered to be the result of the removal of water from the conden
sation of nearby silicon hydroxyl, namely, the dehydroxylation 
reaction. The weight is almost stable over 600 C. However, the 
distribution of successive weight losses depends on the 
framework or on the substituted Sitometal ratio [41]. 
The reduction behavior of the V oxide species doped on 
MCM41 was studied using the H2TPR technique. Fig. 8 shows 
a gradual increase of hydrogen consumption at approximately 
525550 C, which is mainly attributed to the amount of V and 
the reduction of monomeric and oligomeric tetrahedrallike 
coordinated VOx species [4244]. The samples with lower V 
loading exhibit lower reduction temperatures. The wideangle 
XRD and Raman results verify the formation of bulk V2O5 or the 
degree of polymerization of V oxide at high V doping. There
fore, at high V doping, the nVMCM41 catalysts exhibit a 
hightemperature reduction peak. This is the most important 
reason for the decrease in catalytic activity for ODHP. 
The acidic characteristics of the supported nVMCM41 cat
alysts were investigated by NH3TPD, and the results are shown 
in Fig. 9. It is well known that the dehydrogenation perfor
mance of light paraffin is closely related to the acidic properties 
of a catalysts surface [28,45]. Obviously, all the catalysts sup
ported on mesoporous silica MCM41 show a relatively sharp 
desorption peak from 130260 C, which is ascribed to weak 
Lewis acid sites of the isolated tetrahedrallike coordinated VOx 
species [4649]. The desorption peaks at 260500 C and 
above 500 C can be ascribed to medium and strong acid sites, 
respectively. With increasing V doping, it can be seen from the 
profiles that the intensities of weak and mediumacid desorp
tion peaks increase and move to the hightemperature zone, 
indicating the increase in weak and mediumacid sites. These 
results imply that the acidity can be improved by increasing V 
doping. 
3.3.  Morphology 
FESEM images of samples with different V contents are 
shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that pure MCM41 mainly exists 
as spherical particles with a particle size distribution of 
150250 nm. With a small amount of V doping (1.9 and 3.7 
wt%), the spherical particle size becomes large. After the in
troduction of V species, the morphology of the samples changes 
from ordered spherical particles to disordered morphologies. 
During the hydrolytic process, V ions may contact the silica 
source and be incorporated into the framework, resulting in a

change in catalyst morphology. 
TEM images of the 6.8VMCM41 sample are displayed in 
Fig. 11. When the electron beam falls on the sample perpendic
ular to the pore channel, the pores are seen to be arranged in 
patches composed of regular rows; when the electron beam is 
parallel to the pore channel axis, a hexagonal array with a 
channel dimension of approximately 3 nm is revealed. The TEM 
images reveal that the highly ordered nanoporous structure of 
MCM41 is preserved after loading V oxide into the silicate 
framework, which is entirely consistent with the small angle 
XRD and BET results. 
3.4.  Catalytic performance of nVMCM41 catalysts in the ODHP 
reaction 
3.3.1.  Effect of amounts of V doping  
The catalytic activity of nVMCM41 and pure MCM41 on 
the ODHP reaction was evaluated and the results presented in 
Fig. 12. The pure MCM41 exhibits very low catalytic activity 
and propene selectivity. With the loading of V, propane conver
sion and propene selectivity are both markedly enhanced, and 
propane conversion gradually increases as the V content in
creases, until 6.8 wt% is reached. For the 6.8VMCM41 cata
lyst, an initial propane conversion of 58% accompanied by a 
propene selectivity of 92% is obtained. When the V doping 
exceeds 6.8 wt%, the propane conversion gradually decreases 
for 8.8VMCM41 and 10.6VMCM41 catalysts, suggesting that 
overhigh vanadium loading in the MCM41 framework is dis
advantageous to propane oxidative dehydrogenation, possibly 
due to the formation of V2O5 crystallites [28,50]. This has been 
verified by the wideangle XRD and Raman results. It has been 
suggested that metal species of octahedrally coordinated V2O5 
have low activity in the dehydrogenation reaction because of 
the lack of free coordination sites [24]. As reported in the pre
vious work [51], with a similar V content, mesoporous 
SBA15supported V oxide catalysts exhibited a propane con
version of 40% accompanied by a propene selectivity of 57% 
under similar reaction conditions. It is clear that the 
6.8VMCM41 catalyst exhibits much higher C3H8 conversion 
and propene selectivity than mesoporous, traditional sili
casupported VOx catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance 
could be related to highly dispersed V oxide on the large 
specific surface of MCM41 with a highly ordered mesoporous

structure, as described by the BET results. The NH3TPD results 
indicate that high V doping increases the number of acidic sites, 
which reduces propene release from the V active sites, result
ing in deep oxidation and carbon deposition. 
3.3.2.  Effect of CO2 partial pressure on the ODHP reaction 
Fig. 13 shows the CO2 conversion in the ODHP reaction over 
6.8VMCM41 catalysts. It can be seen that CO2 conversion is 
maintained at 10% throughout the reaction period, which is the 
same as other nVMCM41 catalysts (1.910.6 wt% V doping). 
The reaction mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation in the 
presence of CO2 includes a reaction coupling mechanism 
[52,53] and a lattice oxygen mechanism [54,55], which can be 
expressed as the reaction coupling of simple propane dehy
drogenation with the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction 
and the lattice oxygen of isolated tetrahedral VO43. It is illus
trated in Scheme 1. 
The 
reason 
that 
the 
highest 
catalytic 
activity 
of 
6.8VMCM41 has a high degree of dispersion of isolated VO43 
has been verified by Raman and XPS analysis. Scheme 1 shows 
the reaction and regeneration scheme for the CO2 oxidative 
dehydrogenation over nVMCM41 catalysts. In the first step, 
the O of a vanadyl (O=V) group abstracts a H atom from a sec
ondary C atom of propane. The second H abstraction occurs at 
the oxygen of the VOSi bond, yielding H2O·VIII, or at a fresh 
vanadyl (O=V) group, yielding two HOVIV species; propene is 
then released from the V active site. A similar process has been 
reported by DFT calculation and microkinetic simulation [21]. 
In this reaction cycle, the presence of CO2 can make the 
RWGS reaction proceed toward CO generation, and propene 
production increases. CO2 acting as a mild oxidant also pre
vents the decrease of active sites, which is due to the fast 
reoxidation of V3+ to V5+. 
Fig. 14 shows the effect of CO2 partial pressure on 
6.8VMCM41 catalysts. As can be seen from Fig. 14, propane 
conversion and propene selectivity significantly increase in the 
presence of CO2. With increasing CO2/C3H8 ratios, propane 
conversion increases gradually, while propene selectivity ex
hibits almost no variation. Propane conversion with a C3H8/CO2 
molar ratio of 1:5 is similar to that with a C3H8/CO2 molar ratio 
of 1:4 in Fig. 12. It has been verified that moderately increasing 
the C3H8/CO2 ratio (1:4) is advantageous to the catalytic activi
ty on the propane dehydrogenation reaction, as described in 
Scheme 1.

3.3.3.  Recycling of catalysts 
Figure 15 shows the regeneration performance of the 
6.8VMCM41 catalyst. After the reactionregeneration study 
with four cycles, the catalyst still shows good reactivity. Pro
pane conversion and propene selectivity are almost the same 
as the initial reactions because the lattice oxygen of isolated 
VO43 is almost completely restored after regeneration by O2 at 
550 C. The regeneration cycle mechanism is demonstrated in 
Scheme 1. The regeneration performance also benefits from the 
superior thermal stability of the nVMCM41 mesoporous sili
con framework, which has been proved by TG analysis. As 
shown in Fig. 15, propane conversion decreases to approxi
mately 40% after the first 120 min period. This decrease is 
mainly due to the reduction of the active V sites, which is dis
played in Scheme 1. To further investigate the causes of catalyst 
deactivation, TG analysis of the deactivated 6.8VMCM41 cata
lyst after 120 min of the ODHP reaction was carried out, and 
the results are shown in Fig. 16. The weight decrease below 
200 C can be ascribed to the loss of surface adsorption water. 
The weight loss in the range 200350 C can be attributed to 
coke deposits formed on the surface of the VOx sites [56]. Coke 
deposited directly on the surface of active VOx sites shields 
them from propane, and consequently, results in catalyst deac
tivation [57]. The deactivation of catalysts in the ODHP reaction 
is caused by the reduction of the active V sites and coke depos
its formed on the surface of VOx sites. These factors can be 
eliminated by oxidative regeneration, and excellent catalytic 
activity of the 6.8VMCM41 catalyst can be maintained after 
four cycles. 
4.  Conclusions 
The catalytic performance of nVMCM41 catalysts prepared 
by onestep methods was examined in ODHP using CO2 as an 
oxidant. The results of XRD, BET, SEM, and TEM analyses con
firm that the nVMCM41 catalysts maintain a highly ordered 
mesoporous structure, except for the catalysts with excessively 
high V loading, which partially destroys the pore structure of 
MCM41. FTIR, UVvis, XPS, Raman, and H2TPR analyses prove 
the existence of highly dispersed, isolated tetrahedral VO43 
active sites. As V is doped into the framework of MCM41, the 
catalysts maintain a high specific surface area and superior 
thermal stability. The 6.8VMCM41 catalyst exhibits highly 
active and stable catalytic performance for ODHP, which is due 
to the high dispersion of isolated VO43. However, upon further 
increasing the V loading (8.8 and 10.6 wt%), the number of 
acidic sites and V2O5 crystallites increases, which reduces the 
reaction activity. It is verified that moderately increasing the 
C3H8/CO2 ratio (1:4) of steam is advantageous to the catalytic 
activity in ODHP. It is worth mentioning that the nVMCM41 
catalyst performs very well even after four oxidative regenera
tions.
