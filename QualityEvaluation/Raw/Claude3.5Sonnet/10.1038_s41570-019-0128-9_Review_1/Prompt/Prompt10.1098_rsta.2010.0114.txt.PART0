A thermochemical study of ceria: exploiting
an old material for new modes of energy
conversion and CO2 mitigation

We present a comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of the suitability
of cerium oxide (ceria) for thermochemical fuel production. Both portions of the
two-step cycle, (i) oxygen release from the oxide at 1773 and 1873 K under inert
atmosphere, and (ii) hydrogen release upon hydrolysis at 1073 K, are examined
theoretically as well as experimentally. We observe gravimetric fuel productivity that
is in quantitative agreement with equilibrium, thermogravimetric studies of ceria.
Despite the non-stoichiometric nature of the redox cycle, in which only a portion of
the cerium atoms change their oxidation state, the fuel productivity of 8.511.8 ml
of H2 per gram of ceria is competitive with that of other solid-state thermochemical
cycles currently under investigation. The fuel production rate, which is also highly
attractive, at a rate of 4.66.2 ml of H2 per minute per gram of ceria, is found
to be limited by a surface-reaction step rather than by ambipolar bulk diffusion
of oxygen through the solid ceria. An evaluation of the thermodynamic efficiency
of the ceria-based thermochemical cycle suggests that, even in the absence of heat
recovery, solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies of 16 to 19 per cent can be achieved,
assuming a suitable method for obtaining an inert atmosphere for the oxygen
release step.

1. Introduction
More energy from sunlight strikes the Earth in one hour than all of the
energy consumed on the planet in one year (Lewis & Nocera 2006). Thus,
the challenge that modern society faces is not one of identifying a sustainable
energy source, but rather one of capitalizing on the vast solar resource base.
Despite its intermittent supply, solar electricity levels of up to about 20
per cent can be integrated into existing electricity delivery networks through
careful management of grid resources (National Academy of Sciences 2009). For
significantly greater penetration and an eventual complete transition away from
fossil energy, however, the photon energy must be stored and made available
for use when and where energy is needed. To enable this objective, several

plausible storage solutions are already being pursued in laboratories worldwide,
including high-energy-density batteries, hydrogen production via electrolysis,
and hydrogen production via direct photolysis. Despite these efforts, large-scale
energy storage remains elusive. We pursue in this work an alternative strategy
that relies on the capacity of selected non-stoichiometric metal oxides, specifically
cerium oxide (ceria), to release and uptake oxygen in response to changes in
temperature, where the thermal cycling is, ideally, induced by exposure to solar
radiation. The resulting stoichiometry changes can be directly used for fuel
production when coupled with the introduction of appropriate reactant gases.
For example, for hydrogen production, the reaction cycle for the metal oxide
MO2, where M represents Ce and often also a dopant element, can be described
as follows.
higher temperature, TH:
1
dMOy 1
dMOyd + 1
2O2(g)
lower temperature, TL:
H2O(g) + 1

where
thermodynamics predicts that the product will be CO rather than C(graphite)
when the lower-temperature step is carried out at sufficiently high temperatures
(Chueh & Haile 2009b).
This thermochemical approach has its roots in reaction schemes developed in
the 1970s aimed at using the heat from nuclear reactors (Funk 2001; Kodama &
Gokon 2007). The early schemes typically involved corrosive gases such as
H2SO4 and HBr, and cycles with as many as 35 individual reaction steps. The
concept of using metal oxides as substrates for thermochemical production of
hydrogen first appeared in the literature in a publication by Nakamura (1977), in
which cycling between Fe3O4 and FeO was demonstrated. The specific reactions
employed were
TH : Fe3O4 3FeO + 1
2O2(g)
(1.2)
and
TL : 3FeO + H2O(g) Fe3O4 + H2(g)
(1.3)
The thermochemistry of this pair of reactions is such that (under standard
pressures) the first is favoured at temperatures above 2500 K and the latter at
temperatures below about 1000 K. The extremely high temperatures required for
the reduction step (which exceeds the melting temperatures of both FeO and
Fe3O4) render this specific cycle impracticable, but the approach nevertheless
introduced the notion of metal oxides as thermochemical reaction media and
a new strategy for thermochemical fuel production. To lower the temperature
of the first step, substitution of Fe by more easily reduced metals has been
pursued (Tamaura et al. 1995; Steinfeld et al. 1999; Kodama & Gokon 2007).
Thermodynamic analyses have shown Co, Ni and Zn to be the most promising.

State-of-the-art approaches now use these substitutional compounds, with cycles
between the wustite (MO) and spinel (M3O4) phases. An alternative metal oxide
approach, the Zn(g)/ZnO cycle, embraces rather than avoids the volatility of the
material in the reduced state (Steinfeld 2002). Difficulties arise in this case from
the need to quench the Zn from the gaseous state to prevent reoxidation and the
need to use nanoparticle Zn in the hydrolysis step to obtain sufficient reaction
kinetics (Wegner et al. 2006; Melchior et al. 2009).
In the 30 years since the first report by Nakamura (1977) on the FeO/Fe3O4
cycle, significant efforts have been directed towards practical implementation
of the alternatives described. It has been recognized that, for the doped
MO/M3O4 systems, stability of the particlesagainst sintering, vaporization
or even meltingis essential for ensuring easy access of the gaseous phase
to the entirety of the material. One strategy that has emerged is the use of
zirconia as a support to prevent high-temperature coagulation of the active
oxide (Kodama et al. 2006; Gokon et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2008). While
this approach improves short-term cyclability, it introduces redox-inactive
material into the reaction vessel, thereby lowering efficiency and gravimetric
fuel productivity, and the long-term stability of such systems is unknown.
For the Zn(g)/ZnO system, the challenges of delivering mass quantities of
nanoparticles through reactor systems have just begun to be tackled. Thus,
despite significant progress, substantial hurdles remain for the thermochemical
production of hydrogen using oxides, motivating additional efforts in materials
development.
Based on the lessons learned from the fully solid-state MO/M3O4 systems, one
can surmise that, for realistic implementation of solar-thermal fuel production,
materials with excellent thermal stability, a high tendency towards reduction
under moderate heating and an ability to maintain open architectures, at both
the crystal structure and microstructure levels, under aggressive thermal cycling
are desirable. Furthermore, development of thermochemical cycles that produce
not only hydrogen but also fuels such as CH4, CH3OH or CO (the latter
as a syngas component) using CO2 as an input may have greater immediate
acceptability into our energy production and delivery infrastructure. In totality,
these considerations suggest that ceria, which undergoes substantial oxygen
stoichiometry changes without a change in crystal structure, has an extremely
high melting temperature of approximately 2800 K, and displays high catalytic
activity towards carbon-containing gases (Jin et al. 1987; Trovarelli 1996; Murray
et al. 1999; Park et al. 2000; Sharma et al. 2000; Demoulin et al. 2007), is
an attractive material for thermochemical fuel production. Indeed, preliminary
reports of the suitability of ceria for this technology have appeared in the recent
literature (Abanades & Flamant 2006; Kaneko et al. 2007, 2008; Kang et al. 2007;
Miller et al. 2008; Kaneko & Tamaura 2009). Here, the reaction scheme (figure 1)
involves a partial reduction at high temperature rather than a stoichiometric
phase change. We have recently reported our initial results targeting direct
methane and syngas production using samarium-doped ceria, and, despite lower
oxygen uptake and release capacity than in stoichiometric cycles (MO/M3O4 and
M/MO),

this process.

2. Characteristics of ceria relevant for thermochemical fuel production
(a) Thermodynamics
Under ambient pressures and from room temperature to the melting point,
fully oxidized ceria adopts the ideal cubic fluorite crystal structure (figure 2a).
Under reducing conditions, a portion of the Ce converts to the 3+ oxidation
state, and these reduced species are charge-balanced by oxygen vacancies,
where d in the stoichiometry CeO2d represents the vacancy concentration.
A remarkable feature of ceria is that, particularly at high temperatures,
exceptionally high vacancy concentrations can be accommodated without
a change in crystallographic structure (or phase). Indeed, at temperatures
above approximately 1000C (figure 2b), a d of 0.25 can occur entirely
within the framework of the fluorite phase. Furthermore, under conditions
of rapid oxygen loss, vacancy ordering to obtain the CenOm phases may be
suppressed and even higher d values within the fluorite framework appear
possible.
While figure 2b shows the phase behaviour of CeO2d as a function of
oxygen non-stoichiometry, perhaps more relevant for thermochemical cycling
is
knowledge
of
the
oxygen
non-stoichiometry
as
a
function
of
oxygen
partial pressure (or, more strictly, oxygen activity) and temperature, as this
determines the maximum quantity of fuel that can be produced in a single
cycle for a given quantity of ceria. The thermodynamics embodied in the
equilibration between ceria and gas-phase oxygen furthermore provides the
basis for evaluating material behaviour during cycling. In the case of undoped
ceria, direct measurements of the oxygen non-stoichiometry have been carried
out over a wide range of conditions (Panlener et al. 1975), including those
relevant for thermochemical fuel production (figure 3). Where such extensive
measurements have not been carried out, the high-temperature behaviour can be
approximated from an extrapolation of properties measured at more accessible
conditions.
The governing reaction establishing the oxygen non-stoichiometry is the
equilibration of ceria and gas-phase oxygen, i.e. the redox reaction, written in
KrgerVink notation as

(2.4)
This expression applies both to the electrolytic regime, in which the dopant
concentration greatly exceeds the polaron concentration, and to the electronic
regime, in which the reverse is true. The assumption of ideal solution behaviour
required for ready application of equation (2.4) is equivalent to the statement
that the oxidation enthalpy is, to a first approximation, independent of defect
concentration, and that the configurational entropy describes a solution with
random and non-interacting defects. It has been shown that ideal solution
behaviour is obeyed in 1520% samarium-, gadolinium- and yttrium-doped ceria
for d as large as 0.030.05 (Wang et al. 1997; Kobayashi et al. 1999; Otake et al.
2003). In contrast, undoped ceria deviates from ideal solution behaviour for d
greater than 0.01 (Panlener et al. 1975; Duncan et al. 2007; Bishop et al. 2009).
Non-idealities typically result from the formation of intrinsic Ce

complexes, with the effects generally being more pronounced at higher d and
lower temperatures (Otake et al. 2003; Duncan et al. 2007; Bishop et al. 2009).
For the specific case of 15 per cent samarium-doped ceria (Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.925d,
or SDC15), the experimentally determined standard enthalpy and entropy of the
oxidation reaction are 4.18  0.05 eV and 1.15  0.05 meV K1, respectively
(Lai & Haile 2005; Chueh & Haile 2009b). Using these values and equation (2.4),
the computed non-stoichiometry in this material varies as shown in figure 3. From
the two sets of data provided in figure 3, it is evident that, at TH = 1773 K under
inert gas with an oxygen partial pressure of 105 atm, a non-stoichiometry in the
range of d = 0.030.05 is expected for SDC15 (accounting for the uncertainty in
the enthalpy and entropy values), whereas the measured value is 0.06 for undoped

ceria. In turn, these values are equivalent to the release in the reduction half-cycle
at TH of 23 ml of O2 per gram of fully oxidized SDC15 and to 4 ml of O2 per gram
of fully oxidized CeO2 (hereafter reported simply in units of ml g1, irrespective
of doping).
Turning to the fuel production half-cycle at TL, and the particular case of
hydrogen production, the overall reaction can be expressed as the sum of the
ceria oxidation reaction and the steam dissociation reaction (reaction (1.1)).

If the reaction is run with excess steam, thermodynamics predicts the ultimate
complete reoxidation of the reduced ceria, and the quantity of fuel produced will
be exactly equal, within a stoichiometric factor, to the non-stoichiometry achieved
at TH. However, operation of the system in such a mode implies tremendous
energy penalties, as excess quantities of gas must be heated and cooled in each
cycle. A more realistic scenario is one in which the quantity of gas-phase reactant
is fixed at some value that appropriately balances the available oxygen non-
stoichiometry. The quantity of fuel produced in this scenario depends not only on
the oxygen non-stoichiometry attained at TH, but also on the relative reducing
potential of the ceria, and can be computed, much as in the case of the reduction
half-cycle at TH, from a knowledge of the thermodynamic parameters.
The equilibrium constant for the overall reaction (equation (2.5)) of reduced
ceria with steam, K , is simply given as KWKoxd, where KW is the equilibrium
constant for steam dissociation and Koxd is as given in equation (2.4). Taking the
system comprising reduced ceria plus steam to be closed and hence to obey mass
conservation, one finds
K  = KWKoxd(TL) = (1 x 2df)2(1 x/4 df/2)

where df = di a/nCeOy, di is the initial non-stoichiometry attained in the high-
temperature reduction step, nCeOy is the number of moles of ceria, nH2O,i is the
initial number of moles of water, and a is the extent of reaction in moles. Solving
for a yields the amount of hydrogen produced at equilibrium. Gaseous oxygen,
which is assumed to take on a very low concentration during fuel production, is
excluded here from the mass balance for computational simplicity. If the defect
model and hence Koxd are not well known, one can alternatively predict the
equilibrium fuel productivity from knowledge of the partial molar free energy
of lattice oxygen, DGO, as a function of temperature and non-stoichiometry
according to the relationship:

In the case where the input reactant is carbon dioxide (rather than water), an
expression analogous to equation (2.6) or equation (2.7) can be obtained. Here one

begins with the reduction of CO2, where both CO and C(graphite) are considered
as possible products through the following two reactions.
CO2(g) CO(g) + 1
2O2(g)
(2.8)
CO2(g) C(graphite) + O2(g)
(2.9)
Again, the extent of reaction yields the equilibrium quantity of CO and/or C
produced. Taking the process one step further, one can consider the simultaneous
dissociation of CO2 and H2O to yield methane as a product through the reaction
2H2O(g) + CO2(g) CH4(g) + 2O2(g)
(2.10)
where the water-gas-shift equilibrium is taken into account implicitly.
With this formalism, the equilibrium gas-phase compositions were computed
for di = 0.05 and (i) nH2O,i = dinCeOy, (ii) nCO2,i = 1
2dinCeOy, and (iii) nH2O,i =
2nCO2,i = 1
2dinCeOy, with details provided in the Methods section below (5). While
the quantity of reactant supplied under this set of conditions is stoichiometrically
sufficient for full reoxidation of the ceria, thermodynamic considerations indicate
that the reoxidation will not proceed to completion and instead the ceria will
attain, upon system equilibration, a non-zero non-stoichiometry, df. The fuel
production capacity in the oxidation half-cycle is given in such a case not by
the initial non-stoichiometry achieved at high temperature, di, but by the change
in oxygen non-stoichiometry:
Dd = di df.
(2.11)
Each mole of stoichiometry change in bulk oxygen content corresponds to either
1 mole of H2, 1 mole of CO, 0.5 mole of C(graphite) or 0.25 mole of CH4 produced.
The results of the computation (figure 4) show that the amount of fuel produced
increases as TL is lowered, consistent with the greater driving force for ceria
oxidation at lower temperatures relative to hydrogen or carbon oxidation. The
implication of this behaviour on overall solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, which
at first glance might be considered to benefit from a small temperature swing
between TH and TL, is discussed below (see 4).
An arguably more common method for assessing the thermodynamic suitability
of a potential thermochemical reaction medium is through a direct consideration
of DGoxd in comparison to DGrxn for hydrogen oxidation (figure 5) for standard
state conditions (pgas = 1 atm). A subtlety arises here in that the initial and final d
values in the calculation of DGoxd of ceria are inherently arbitrary. For simplicity,
the reaction is considered in the limit in which the non-stoichiometry change is
infinitesimal (as in the case of equation (2.2)), and several selected values of d are
considered. The data are also compared to the stoichiometric reaction Ce2O3 +
1
2O2(g) CeO2, which has no contribution from defect configurational entropy,
and is directly analogous to a reaction such as 3FeO 1
2O2 + Fe3O4. The figure
reveals graphically the thermodynamic underpinnings of the thermochemical
reaction approach. In general, where DGoxd of ceria lies below DG0
rxn of hydrogen
oxidation, i.e. at low temperatures, the ceria has sufficient reducing power
that it will induce dissociation of steam as the ceria becomes oxidized. At
high temperatures, the reducing power of ceria decreases, as indicated by the

decrease in magnitude of DGoxd, and where DGoxd becomes positive, ceria releases
oxygen (under 1 atm pO2). The clear dependence of DGoxd on d results from the
dependence of both the ceriumoxygen bond enthalpy and the configurational
entropy on defect concentrations. As evident from figure 5, the dependence is
such that, at a given temperature, TH, it is increasingly more difficult to liberate
additional oxygen from ceria (DGoxd becomes increasingly more negative with
increasing d). Similarly, at a given TL, it is increasingly more difficult to reoxidize
ceria because the difference DGoxd DGrxn becomes less negative with decreasing
d. These considerations thus reveal subtle differences in the manner in which
the redox thermodynamics of non-stoichiometric compounds and stoichiometric
reactions apply to thermochemical reactions.
(b) Kinetics
Turning from the thermodynamics to the kinetics of thermochemical fuel
production, both the oxygen release (TH) and the water or carbon dioxide
dissociation (TL) portions of the cycle require serial steps of heterogeneous surface
reaction and oxygen bulk diffusion. In principle, either reaction step may be rate-
limiting. The time for bulk diffusion can be estimated from knowledge of the
chemical (or ambipolar) diffusion coefficient, 
D, describing the coupled migration
of oxygen vacancies and electrons under an oxygen chemical potential gradient.
For a mixed oxide-ion and electron conductor,
D depends on the individual
oxide vacancy and electron diffusion coefficients, Dion and Deon, respectively,

where ezi is the charge of species i. Using the mobility data reported for SDC15
(Lai & Haile 2005), such an analysis yields the ambipolar diffusion coefficient
presented in figure 6, where both the directly measured (Lai & Haile 2005) and
the computed 
D values for a range of temperatures and oxygen partial pressures
are presented. The slight deviations between the two sets of values are due to
slight dependences of the mobilities on carrier concentrations, a consideration not
explicitly accounted for in the calculation.1 Under the limiting conditions in which
the doped material is held deep in the electrolytic regime such that Deonceon 
Dioncion (requiring ceon cion/10 because of the higher mobility of electrons),
equation (2.13) reduces to 
D Deon. Deep in the electronic regime in which 2cion 
=
ceon, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient reduces to 
D 3DionDeon/(2Dion + Deon).
For fixed mobilities, 
D of acceptor-doped ceria decreases with increasing defect
concentrations (increasing d, decreasing pO2) as the transport process transforms
from one that is determined entirely by the electron mobility to one that is
an appropriately weighted average of both the electron and vacancy mobilities.
More significant is the overall remarkably high value of
D, falling within the
range of 1.7 × 105 to 1.1 × 104 cm2 s1 at 1073 K and within 2.1 × 104 to
3.6 × 104 cm2 s1 at 1773 K.
For undoped ceria, the electron and oxygen ion vacancy concentrations are
related according to 2cion = ceon under all relevant oxygen partial pressures and
temperatures and, accordingly, the latter limiting expression for 
D applies under
all conditions. This consideration implies, in turn, that the ambipolar diffusion
coefficient is independent of defect concentration under the ideal solution limit.
Assuming that the vacancy and polaron mobilities are the same in doped and
undoped ceria, the value for this fixed ambipolar diffusion coefficient corresponds
to the minimum value encountered in doped ceria, i.e. that at high d. At
low oxygen non-stoichiometry (close to ambient oxygen partial pressures) the
1In principle, the pO2-dependent mobilities can be directly used for the computation. However,
for high temperatures outside of the measurement range of the earlier experiments, the nature
of the pO2 dependence is unknown, precluding extrapolation of the measured data to the higher
temperatures of interest for thermochemical cycling. As the diffusion coefficient is, overall, relatively
insensitive to both oxygen partial pressure and temperature, these subtleties are not explored
further here.

chemical diffusion coefficient in SDC15 is substantially higher than it is in
undoped ceria. The difference is about one order of magnitude at 923 K and
increases at lower temperature owing to the larger enthalpy of vacancy ion
migration than electron migration.

With the diffusion coefficient in hand, it is possible to obtain the characteristic
time, t, for a diffusion-limited process from the expression t l2/4 
D, where l
is the diffusion length. Using the smallest value of
D for each temperature
in the 7731073 K range and a diffusion length of 5 mm (a typical grain size
in porous ceria), the characteristic diffusion time falls in the range of only
40.3 ms. A more rigorous calculation that takes into the account the temporal
and positional variations of 
D as the reaction proceeds gives values within the
range of 20.1 ms. This estimate indicates that bulk diffusion is unlikely to be
rate-limiting in thermochemical fuel production unless the surface reaction rate is
exceptionally rapid, or reaction substrates with extremely unfavourable geometric
configurations and/or morphological characteristics are used.
3. Experimental demonstration
With these expectations in hand, CeO2d was exposed to thermochemical cycling,
from which the thermodynamics, kinetics and stability of fuel production were
examined. Procedural details are provided below (5). The results (figures 7
10) indicate that ceria is remarkably well suited as a thermochemical reaction
medium. On aggressive heating (1000 K min1) to 1773 K under an inert
atmosphere (pO2 = 105 atm), almost immediate release of oxygen is observed
(figure 7a). The total quantity of oxygen detected by mass spectrometry, 4.3 
0.3 ml g1, corresponding to d = 0.066  0.005, is within error of the value of
4 ml g1 determined via thermogravimetry (Panlener et al. 1975). An identical
oxygen release amount, within experimental error, was obtained for lower ramp
rates (e.g. 100 K min1). Moreover, the oxygen release reaches 70 per cent
completion within 5 min of the initiation of the heating and largely keeps
pace with the rate of temperature rise throughout heating. Upon lowering
the temperature to 1073 K and introducing steam (pH2O = 0.250.27 atm), rapid
hydrogen production is observed, with 90 per cent of the fuel produced within
1.8 min of initiation. Furthermore, the total amount of hydrogen produced,
8.5  0.6 ml g1, implies complete reoxidation of the reduced ceria and hence
full use of the available non-stoichiometry. Together, these values correspond to
an average hydrogen production rate of 4.6 ml min1 g1 (instantaneous reaction
rate averaged over the time required to reach 90 per cent of the extent
of reaction).
Raising

expected,
on
thermodynamic grounds, to increase the extent of oxygen non-stoichiometry
(figure 3), and indeed experimentally such behaviour is observed (figure 7b). Ceria
reduction at 1873 K increases oxygen release from 4.3 to 5.9  0.4 ml g1, or to
d = 0.091  0.006. After cooling and steam injection at 1073 K, the entirety of
the structural non-stoichiometry is again used in the fuel production step, with
11.8  0.8 ml g1 now produced. The rate, 6.2 ml min1 g1, is higher than that
for the less reduced material, possibly as a result of increased surface vacancy
concentrations leading to higher reaction rates.
While the kinetics of thermochemical fuel production using ceria are seen here
to be relatively facile, it is noteworthy that, in comparison to the expectations for
a bulk-diffusion-limited process (with characteristic time estimated at 0.34 ms
above), the rates are, in fact, rather slow, indicating that some other step must

limit the overall reaction kinetics. Under non-isothermal conditions, the oxygen
release process is largely limited by the rate at which the ceria can be heated using
the furnace employed, as evidenced by the oxygen release behaviour on heating,
already noted above, and by the further observation that the oxygen release rate
depends on the heating rate (for experiments performed at heating rates as low
as 100 K min1). Under isothermal conditions, heat transfer is unlikely to be rate-
limiting because the quantities of heat generated or consumed by the reaction are

small relative to the heat input from the furnace. A remaining possibility as the
rate-limiting step is the surface reaction, and, indeed, the experimental evidence
points in this direction. The hydrogen production over Rh-decorated SDC15 was
found to be substantially faster than over neat SDC15 (figure 8). The reaction
was examined in this instance under kinetically unfavourable conditions of low
overall water partial pressure in order to capture the influence of the catalyst.

indicates that a step involving the surface must be rate-limiting and that bulk,
ambipolar oxygen diffusion is much too rapid to have any detrimental impact on
fuel production rates.
Beyond suitability for hydrogen production (both thermodynamically and
kinetically), ceria has the characteristic of rapidly dissociating CO2 to CO
and lattice oxygen (figure 9). Once again, the fuel productivity matches precisely
that expected for complete use of the structural oxygen non-stoichiometry, and
at 1073 K the average reaction rate is 1.6 ml min1 g1 (pCO2 = 0.032 atm). As
discussed in greater detail in our previous study (Chueh & Haile 2009a), CO2
dissociation at temperatures below approximately 940 K would be anticipated to
yield solid carbon (at least in transient form), as shown in figure 4. However, no
carbon deposition has been observed on neat ceria, even at a very low gas space
velocity of 4300 h1. The situation is altered by the introduction of a catalyst
such as Ni that enables transient carbon deposition under thermodynamically
favourable conditions. The carbonaceous species produced in this step provides a
path to direct methane formation when CO2 and H2O are simultaneously reacted
with reduced ceria. Again, the details have been discussed previously.
In any technologically significant thermochemical process, fuel productivity
(fuel per unit of oxide, ml g1) and production rates (fuel per unit of time per unit
of oxide, ml min1 g1) must remain high over thousands of cycles. What is evident
from the long-term cycling behaviour in figure 10 (TH = 1773 K, TL = 1073 K) is
that the hydrogen production rate decreases by about 50 per cent over the first
100 cycles, then maintains a stable value of 1.3 ml min1 g1 for the remaining 400
cycles. The hydrogen and oxygen productivities mirror the hydrogen production
rate, decreasing, respectively, from initial values of 8 and 4 ml g1 to stable values
of 6 and 3 ml g1 after about 100 cycles. Most significant is that for all cycles all
of the non-stoichiometry created in the ceria during high-temperature reduction
is subsequently used in the low-temperature water dissociation step, despite the
clear loss in rate for this reaction. That is, the volumetric ratio of hydrogen to
oxygen produced remains at approximately 2 throughout cycling. The overall
decrease in productivity (of both oxygen and hydrogen) can be understood to be
a result of the decreased reaction rates in combination with a fixed cycle time
(10 min for each half-cycle) that is no longer sufficient for complete reaction. At
the conclusion of the cycling experiment, it was verified that an oxygen release
amount of 4 ml g1 can indeed be obtained if the reaction is allowed to proceed
to completion.
The decrease in reaction rates is most likely due to a loss in ceria surface
area (figure 11), which limits the available sites for reaction to occur. Prior
to thermochemical cycling, the ceria was formed into a porous monolith
with a specific surface area of 0.1 m2 g1 by sintering in the presence of
a fugitive pore former. The resulting material was subsequently annealed
for 3 h at 1773 K in an attempt to stabilize the microstructure. By this
process, a highly porous structure (approx. 70% porosity) formed of grains
with an average size of approximately 5 mm was obtained. After completion
of the 500 cycles, coarsening of the microstructure is clearly evident, with
the average grain size increasing to approximately 15 mm and each grain
becoming significantly more faceted. These results emphasize that any path
to higher overall fuel production rates (based on shorter cycle times) should
focus on the surface characteristics of ceria. However, it must be noted

high that attention may be more fruitfully directed towards enhancing bulk,

where nH2O is the moles of water heated per mole of hydrogen produced and
Cp,j is the molar heat capacity of species j at constant pressure. The absorption
efficiency, habs, is calculated by assuming a blackbody cavity with an incident
radiation flux of 5 MW m2. The change in ceria non-stoichiometry, Dd, which, as
already noted, for the case of hydrogen production directly yields the quantity of
fuel produced, is taken from the closed-system equilibrium calculations described
above. For the purposes of evaluating the impact of cycling strategies on
the thermodynamic efficiency, and for comparison with other thermochemical
approaches, the energy penalty associated with attaining the low oxygen partial
pressure required in the reduction half-cycle (fixed here at 105 atm) is ignored
in this analysis. Furthermore, because of the uncertainties associated with
extrapolation of the properties of SDC15 to the very high temperatures of
interest for thermochemical cycling, the analysis is limited to undoped ceria,
for which high-temperature thermogravimetric data are available. In this case,
the dependences of the partial molar thermodynamic terms for lattice oxygen
(DGO(d) = DHO(d) TDSO(d)) on non-stoichiometry are treated numerically, as
determined from the raw data (figure 3).
For a given material with a fixed set of properties, the efficiency and fuel
productivity can be manipulated through selection of the process parameters, TH,
TL and rH2O = nH2O,i/dinCeOy, where rH2O is the molar quantity of steam injected
into the system at the initiation of the fuel production half-cycle relative to the
available ceria non-stoichiometry. A preliminary analysis of the dependence of
efficiency on rH2O indicated a peak in efficiency at rH2O = 2, and all subsequent
computations were performed for this condition. The impact of changing TL and
TH on equilibrium fuel productivity and efficiency is summarized in figure 12. As
perhaps intuitively expected, the fuel productivity increases (figure 12a) as the
temperature swing is widened. That is, Dd increases as either TH is increased
or TL is lowered. This is readily understood as follows. With increasing TH, the
amount of oxygen released increases, and with decreasing TL, the reducing power
of ceria to dissociate H2O increases. Incomplete reoxidation of the ceria occurs
when TL is too high, and as TL is lowered, the fuel productivity rapidly approaches
the maximum value of di attained at TH. Lowering TL below about 1000 K has
minimal benefit for fuel productivity, regardless of TH. It is to be emphasized
that, by definition of an equilibrium calculation, it is assumed that the kinetics
are fully reversible.
In terms of efficiency, a broad maximum is observed as a function of TL
for any given TH (figure 12b). If TL is insufficiently low, then the reducing
power of the ceria is too low to induce extensive H2O dissociation and the
fuel productivity is low relative to a large input heat. If, on the other hand,
TL is lower than required, i.e. beyond what is necessary to reoxidize the ceria,

the excess thermal cycling is unused and, again, the efficiency decreases. This
combination of factors leads to the broad peak displayed in the curves of
figure 12b. An important aspect of the data in figure 12 is the fact that both
fuel productivity and efficiency increase monotonically with TH for the range
examined. This behaviour is highlighted in figure 12c, in which the maximum
efficiency at each TH is shown (the TL implied for each of the data points
rises somewhat with TH). The monotonic increase in efficiency reflects the
decreasing energy cost of heating ceria per unit of fuel productivity or Dd. That
is, with increasing TH, Dd increases exponentially and hence the second term
of equation (4.2) decreases owing to the prefactor (Dd1) decreasing much more
rapidly than the quasi-linear increase in the heat capacity integral (owing to
increased temperature swing). Ultimately, a limiting value is reached because,
while the energy cost of heating ceria per mole of fuel decreases with increasing
TH, the other terms (reducing the ceria, heating the water to TL, and the

examined (figure 12d). The data suggest that, if the practical challenges of
achieving a high temperature oxygen release step at 2073 K and operating
over a temperature swing of DT = 940 K (TL = 1133 K) can be overcome, an
efficiency of almost 22 per cent is attainable, even in the absence of heat
recovery. If one considers a less aggressive and arguably more realistic cycle of
TH = 1873 K and TL = 1123 K, the efficiency remains at an attractive value of
19 per cent.
5. Methods
(a) Experimental
CeO2 (Alfa Aesar) and Sm0.15Ce0.85O1.925 (Nextech, SDC15) were each ball-milled
with 30 wt% starch in ethanol, uniaxially pressed into a pellet, and sintered at
1623 K for 5 h. The porous monolith, typically more than 65 per cent in porosity,
was polished into a cylinder measuring 0.250.32 g in weight, 7 mm in diameter,
and 24 mm in thickness. The sample was then loaded into a horizontal alumina
tube reactor (9.5 mm diameter), in turn placed inside an infrared furnace (Ulvac-
Riko VHT-E44). A thermocouple, enclosed in an alumina sheath, was placed in
direct contact with the sample and used to control the furnace. Temperature ramp
rates were varied from 100 to 1000 K min1. During the temperature ramp from
TL to TH, the isothermal dwell at TH (reduction half-cycle), and temperature
ramp down to TL, digital mass flow controllers delivered 10 ppm O2 (balance N2)
gas at 1000 ml min1 to the reactor. After equilibration at TL, the sample was
exposed to humidified N2, achieved by passing 200 ml min1 dry gas through a
bubbler inside a temperature-controlled oven. Effluent humidity was measured
using a Rotronic Hygroflex 2 sensor, and dried, effluent gas composition was
determined using a Pfeiffer Thermostar GSD301 quadrupole mass spectrometer.
Quantification of the mass spectrometry data was achieved by performing, daily,
six-point calibrations for both oxygen and hydrogen at the concentrations of
interest. A blank run with no sample confirmed that the alumina tube does not
release or absorb detectable amounts of oxygen, nor does it dissociate water.
A slightly different set-up was used to examine CO2 dissociation into CO,
as well as the effect of metal catalysts. For the CO2 dissociation experiment,
the starting powders were ball-milled with starch and pressed into a pellet as
described above and sintered at 1773 K for 24 h. To reduce the effect of gaseous
mass transport, the pellet was lightly crushed and sieved to obtain particle sizes
between 150 and 500 mm. For the catalyst experiment, RhSDC15 was prepared
via incipient wetness impregnation by dissolving rhodium nitrate. After calcining
at 1023 K, the powder was pressed into a pellet, crushed and sieved (same as
above), and the agglomerates sintered at 1773 K for 24 h. SDC15 without the
catalyst was prepared in the same manner for comparison. Samples containing 1 g
of material were loaded into a 10 mm diameter, vertical, packed bed reactor with

by digital mass flow controllers, and the effluent gas was measured by a Varian

columns. H2, CH4, CO and CO2 concentrations were converted to flow rates using
an internal N2 standard, which also served as a diluent. In some cases, Ar was

also used as a diluent. Gas chromatography calibration curves were established
using analytical-grade, premixed gases. The reduction of ceria was achieved by
flowing a mixture of H2, H2O and Ar at either pO2 = 2.0 × 1021 atm at 1073 K or
3.8 × 1018 atm at 1173 K. Humidification was achieved by bubbling the reaction
gas through an H2O bubbler inside a temperature-controlled bath. The pO2 was
calculated by assuming gas-phase equilibrium and verified using an oxygen sensor.
The oxidation of ceria was achieved by passing diluted water vapour or CO2 over
the packed bed of ceria particles. The temperature excursion upon oxidation of
the ceria in no case exceeded 6C.
(b) Numerical
(i) Undoped ceria
The oxygen enthalpy and entropy measured as a function of oxygen
non-stoichiometry (Panlener et al. 1975) were interpolated using appropriate
exponential or polynomial functions. The equilibrium fuel productivity was then
computed using thermodynamic parameters for H2(g), H2O(g) and O2(g) from
JANAF and NASA tables. All computations were carried out in MATLAB.
(ii) Samarium-doped ceria
The experimentally measured standard oxygen enthalpy and entropy (Lai &
Haile 2005; Chueh & Haile 2009b) were extrapolated to higher temperatures
and oxygen partial pressures using the ideal solution model. Furthermore, the
temperature dependences of the standard enthalpy and entropy were determined
by using the DulongPetit law to estimate the heat capacity of lattice oxygen
and using NASA tables for the heat capacity of gaseous oxygen. The equilibrium
hydrogen fuel productivity and efficiency were calculated in the same way as for
undoped ceria. The equilibrium CO, CO2, C(graphite) and CH4 productivities
were calculated using the GIBBS SOLVER (HSC Chemistry). The activity of
C(graphite) was taken to be unity.
6. Concluding remarks
The overall evaluation of the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of ceria,
both undoped and doped, indicates that it is attractive as a thermochemical
reaction medium. It is of some importance to compare these characteristics
with those of other materials also considered for such an application. The most
important figures of merit are the fuel productivity (which determines the amount
of reaction medium required and thereby the size of the solar thermochemical
power plant, and also influences the efficiency), the fuel production rate (which
determines how quickly the cycles can be performed, influencing both the size of
the power plant and the efficiency), and the thermodynamic efficiency (computed
as described above on the assumption of reversible kinetics). Moreover, the
overall ease of implementing the cycling strategy is an additional factor requiring
consideration.
On first inspection, a non-stoichiometric metal oxide thermochemical cycle
might be expected to display a relatively low fuel productivity because of the
relatively small change in gravimetric oxygen content between the high and low

temperatures of the cycles. The productivity values obtained here for hydrogen
are of the order of 912 ml g1 (depending on the specific cycling strategy
employed). In contrast, stoichiometric cycles such as FeO/Fe3O4 and Zn(g)/ZnO
offer theoretical fuel productivities of 97 and 275 ml g1, respectively. In practice,
however, these productivity values have not been demonstrated. Because use of a
redox-inactive support is required in order to achieve cyclability and reasonable
kinetics in the ferrites, the gravimetric fuel productivity of the composite
system is dramatically reduced, with an experimental value of 12.2 ml g1 (TH =
1673 K, TL = 1073 K) having been reported for 20 wt% NiFe2O4/ZrO2 (Kodama &
Gokon 2007). Furthermore, because of the low oxygen diffusivity through the
stoichiometric phases (tracer diffusion coefficient approx. 1011 cm2 s1 at 1473 K)
(OBryan & DiMarcello 1970), even when the ferrite is supported on zirconia
the fuel production rates are rather low. For example, a hydrogen production
rate of approximately 101 ml min1 g1 at 1273 K (pH2O = 0.42 atm) has been
reported for 20 wt% NiFe2O4/ZrO2 (Kodama & Gokon 2007), significantly lower
than the rate demonstrated here. The computed thermodynamic HHV efficiency
for the supported nickel ferrite cycle operating between 1673 K and 1273 K
is approximately 24 per cent (obtained by the same methodology as in this
work), with the heating of the zirconia as the main energy penalty. Additional
challenges with the ferrite systems are the tendency towards particle coagulation,
which is not entirely alleviated through use of a supportseveral studies have
involved mechanical grinding of the material between each cycle (Kodama et al.
2006; Kodama & Gokon 2007; Gokon et al. 2008)and the tendency towards
volatilization. Slow kinetics are similarly a major challenge for the Zn/ZnO
cycle, particularly during the low-temperature metal oxidation (hydrolysis) step.
Here, an effectively impermeable oxide layer, with an oxygen tracer diffusion
coefficient of 1014 cm2 s1 at 1473 K (Haneda et al. 1999), coats the metallic
zinc, impeding rapid reaction. As a consequence, the hydrogen production rate
is low, with a value of approximately 0.3 ml min1 m2 having been reported at
603 K (pH2O = 0.4 atm; Ernst et al. 2009). Whether the ambitious strategy of using
nanoparticulate Zn to address reaction rates can be realized and its consequences
on efficiency remain to be seen.
Beyond suitability for a single solar-thermal reactor, it is important to consider
the potential scalability of any thermochemical reaction medium to address world
energy demands. Though a rare-earth element, cerium is in fact as similarly
abundant as copper (Haxel et al. 2002), and the worldwide reserve of cerium
oxide is of the order of 107 tonnes (Hedrick 2007). Based on a fuel productivity
of 8 × 103 l of H2(g) per tonne of CeO2 per cycle, and running 100 cycles per day,
approximately 5 × 102 tonnes are required to construct a 100 MW fuel-cell-based
power plant2 that operates for 6 h d1 (600 MWh capacity). Therefore, cerias
reserve is sufficient to make a global impact.
While ceria offers several benefits for thermochemical cycling over alternative
metal oxide systems, a ceria-based cycle is not without its own set of challenges.
The most significant is perhaps the high temperatures required in order to attain
high efficiency. Solar concentration to achieve a temperature of 2073 K is not
inherently problematic, but it is unclear how one can construct a reactor that

is compatible with such a cycling condition. Furthermore, the energy penalty
of using gases with low oxygen partial pressure during the oxygen release half-
cycle is a challenge that all thermochemical routes to solar fuel production must
ultimately address, and if the sweep gas is nitrogen, care may be required to
avoid the formation of NOx. In light of the thermodynamic analysis presented
here, it is apparent that cycling strategies alone cannot be used to fully address
these challenges for the parent compound CeO2d. Such an observation then leads
one to consider whether targeted doping strategies can be employed to modify
the enthalpy and entropy terms of the ceria redox reaction so as to achieve
a high sensitivity of oxygen non-stoichiometry to oxygen partial pressure and
temperature over any desired operating window (and shift the curves presented
in figure 5). Recently, Singh et al. have reported that Ce0.67Cr0.33O2.11 can be
reduced in nitrogen at a moderate temperature of 738 K. This result suggests
that, indeed, materials optimization can result in a thermochemical cycle based
on non-stoichiometric oxides that has even more to offer than one based on known
ceria formulations in terms of the key metrics of fuel productivity, production rate,
efficiency and ease of cycle operation. Irrespective of the specific composition, with
the experimental data reported here, the approach is clearly demonstrated and
opens up new avenues for storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds.
