Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane was tested using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant over bimetallic CrV supported catalysts (MCM-41, ZSM-5, MCM-22 and mesoZSM-5). The textural properties of the catalysts were measured by means of XRD, N2 adsorption, SEM-EDX, Raman, H2-TPR, pyridine FT-IR, NH3 and CO2-TPD techniques. The metal content of Cr and V was maintained around 1.2 and 2.8 wt% for the catalytic test in packed bed reactor at different temperatures (525600 C) for 180 min. 1.2Cr2.8 V/MCM-41 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/ZSM-5 exhibited maximum conversion of 14 and 13.1 %, respectively at 10 min and 600 C. Significantly, high butenes selectivity was observed over MCM-41 (86.27 %) than ZSM-5 support (58.1 %). The mesoporosity in ZSM-5 had a negative impact on conversion level (7.1 %) but improved the butenes selectivity slightly. 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 showed the highest cracking ability leading to overall reduced butenes selectivity (57.9 %). The study shows that over all catalysts, n-butane conversion is independent of CO2 conversion. 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 showed highest CO2 conversion in the range 2.352.2 % between 525 and 550 C. The apparent activation energies of dehydrogenation and cracking reaction over the four catalysts were evaluated. The ratio of conversion to coke weight per cent over the four catalysts are observed in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22.

1 Introduction
Light olefins such as butene are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives and various other petrochemical products [1]. The current world capacity for 1-butene is about 1.3 million metric tpy, and the demand is expected to increase 56 % year1 through 2015. Similarly, global consumption of butadiene is expected to increase from 10 million tons in 20062013 million tons by 2015. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane to butenes is an important alternative process to classical dehydrogenation, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes because it consumes less energy and reduces undesired cracking reactions that take place at high reaction temperature [2]. However, dehydrogenation process still needs to overcome several challenges at the operating temperature of 550700 C due to its series of competing reactions that renders severe coke formation leading to catalysts deactivation. One of the most important challenge in n-butane dehydrogenation is to obtaining a catalyst with highly increased selectivity to n-butene and 1,3-butadiene by preventing side reactions such as complete-oxidative reactions, while achieving the conversion of n-butane to the maximum [3]. Commercially, dehydrogenation units use Pt/Al2O3 or Pt/Sn/Al2O3 or Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively [4]. In the past several decades, the role of different metal oxides on different supports like ZrO2, SiO2, and zeolites has been explored for dehydrogenation [5, 6]. Among the oxide catalysts, vanadium and chromium oxide supported catalysts have been most promising for ODH due to their high catalytic activity. Hakuli et al. [7] reported that silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were effective for the production of lower alkenes such as propene and isobutene. Botavina et al. [8] stated that for ODH of propane and isobutane, the highest activity, selectivity and stability were achieved over 5.0 wt% CrOx/silica catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method. Volpe et al. [9] investigated n-butane dehydrogenation using VOx supported on USY, NaY, γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3. The high catalytic activity of VOx/USY and butane selectivity was related to the VOx monolayer and mild acidity. Highly dispersed VOx/SBA-15 mesoporous silica has been found to exhibit a highly efficient oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to light olefins (propene + ethylene). The olefin selectivity was observed up to 80 % at a high propane conversion of 41.7 %. The enhanced propene selectivities at higher propane conversions have been attributed to the unique large pore diameters and the low surface acidity of the SBA-15 materials [10]. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on high surface area, pore expanded MCM-41 silica was investigated for ethane dehydrogenation. The study showed that the ethane conversion strongly depend on the chromia loading and the catalyst preparation method [11]. Similarly, VOX species supported on hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) were found to be active in ODH of n-butane, where the isolated monomeric VOX species were determined to play most active catalytic role [12]. The comparative study on V-containing different mesoporous siliceous materials such HMS, SBA-16, SBA-15 and MCM-48 in ODH of propane and n-butane highlights the importance of population of tetrahedrally coordinated VOx complexes and isolated monomeric VOx complexes [13].
The literature reports show that dehydrogenation reaction has been exhaustively carried out in the presence of conventional oxygen as oxidant. Such oxygen assisted dehydrogenation is less attractive due to its exothermicity, necessitating the removal of heat in order to avoid the deep oxidation to CO2. The heat removal step is necessary in order to achieve high selectivity to butenes. In the current trend, emissions of greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide have become major problem in global climate changes. Recently, there are several attempts is being made either to capture CO2 [14] or utilize it as co-feed gas in dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and light alkanes [15]. Unlike oxygen, CO2 exists as gaseous state during whole reaction steps and possesses high heat capacity. Moreover, reaction coupling, namely processes combining dehydrogenation with reverse watergas shift reaction, is an attractive approach to improve the equilibrium conversion in the dehydrogenation reactions [16]. However, the best known commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst was found to be inhibited by CO2, while over CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/ZSM-5, the presence of CO2 showed a promoting effect [17]. Until now, ODH of n-butane in CO2 atmosphere over bimetal (CrV) containing mesoporous material (MCM-41, mesoZSM-5) and microporous zeolites (MCM-22, ZSM-5) has not been explored. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of time on stream and different temperatures over the four catalysts. The conversion of n-butane and CO2, molar selectivity of dehydrogenation products, distribution of butene isomers, apparent activation energy, olefin to paraffin ratio, ratio of conversion to coke weight percent were all investigated.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalysts synthesis
The ZSM-5 was procured from Catal International, while the MCM-22 zeolite was obtained from Industrial Chemicals, USA. The Meso-ZSM-5 zeolite having a Si/Al of 30 was obtained from the J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry, Czech Republic. It was synthesized using carbon black (CBP 2000, Cabot Corporation) as a secondary template with an average particle diameter of 12 nm [18]. The H-form of catalysts were turned into Na form by repeated ion-exchange with NaNO3 at 60 C for 3 h, filtered, dried and calcined at 550 C for 4 h.
MCM-41 was synthesized as follows: 10.6 g of sodium meta silicate (Aldrich) and appropriate amount of chromium nitrate was dissolved in 50 g of water and then thoroughly stirred until a clear solution was obtained. 4.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Aldrich) was dissolved in 30 g of distilled H2O. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 h, and then the pH of the resulting gel was adjusted to 10.5 with 4 N sulfuric acid followed by stirring for 3 h. The resulting homogenous solution was transferred into an autoclave and heated to 140 C in static conditions for 12 h. The solid product was filtered, washed thoroughly using distilled water, dried at 80 C overnight, then calcined at 550 C for 6 h to remove the surfactant.
2.1.1 Synthesis of CrV/support (Si-MCM-41 (M-41), Na-MCM-22(M-22), Na-ZSM-5
(Z-5) and mesoporous Na-ZSM-5 (mesoZ-5)) by wet impregnation method:
CrV bimetals was impregnated onto support by wet impregnation method. For 1.2 Cr and 2.8 wt% V impregnation over MCM-41(1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41), 0.092 g of chromium nitrate and 0.064 g of ammonium metavanadate was dissolved in 30 mL deionized water and then added to 1 g of support. The resulting mixture was stirred, dried overnight at 80 C and then calcined at 550 C for 4 h (3 C min1).
2.2 Characterization
Atomic absorption measurements were carried out with a Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 100 using a mixed gas of acetyleneN2Oair. The Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on Rigaku Miniflex II system using nickel filtered CuKα radiation λ = 1.5,406 Å at 40 kV and 30 mA. The surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption at 196 C using AUTOSORB-1 (Quantachrome). Before adsorption measurements, samples (ca. 0.1 g) were heated at 400 C for 10 h under nitrogen flow. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of calcined materials were measured at liquid nitrogen temperature (196 C). The surface areas and pore diameters were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, respectively. TPR and TPD (temperature-programmed reduction and ammonia or CO2 desorption) experiments were performed in BEL-CAT-A-200, chemisorption apparatus that consists of a gas mixing unit allowing both continuous and pulsed reactant dosing, U-tube quartz microreactor with a thermocouple placed inside the sample, and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The linearity of the TCD response was proven by the injection of gas pulses of various known compositions, and the quantitative hydrogen consumption was calibrated in every measurement by a series of calibration gas pulses. TPR analysis was performed using Ar/H2 gas mixture (95/5 vol%). The total flow rate of the feed was 50 ml min1. Before the experiment, the sample (50 mg) was preheated in He at 300 C for 3 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The sample was heated at 10 C min1 to the final temperature of 700 C. The H2 consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector and CuO was used as a reference for the calibration of H2 consumption. Temperature programmed ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out on the same instrument. The sample (50 mg) was pretreated in a flow of He (50 mL min1) at 500 C for 1 h. Then the sample was exposed to He/NH3 mixture (95/5 vol%) or He/CO2 (95/5 vol%) at room temperature for 30 min. The gas phase was removed by He purging for 1 h followed by which TPD was performed in He flow (50 mL min1) at a heating rate of 10 C min1, and the desorbed NH3 or CO2 was monitored by a TCD detector. The acidity of the zeolites was measured using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a high temperature vacuum chamber using pyridine as a probe. The sample (50 mg) was pressed and placed in a sample holder for pretreatment at 400 C under vacuum for 1 h. The sample was then cooled and the spectrum was recorded. After pyridine adsorption, the sample was heated at 150, 250 and 400 C under vacuum (105 mbar) for 30 min. The removed material was then cooled to room temperature and then the spectrum was recorded again. The acidity was calculated using the extinction coefficient (0.75) of the bands of pyridine adsorbed Brnsted at Lewis acid sites. The morphological characterisation and elemental composition of the catalyst was carried by SEM on a JEOL JSM 5600LV instrument coupled with an EDX analyser. The amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts was determined by a common combustion method (multi EA 2000 Analytikjena). The system is a specially developed to permit simultaneous or separate determination of the total carbon and total sulphur in samples of solids, pastes and liquids by means of high temperature oxidation in a current of oxygen. It is based on special HTC (high temperature ceramics) technology which renders a catalyst superfluous. A small amount of the spent catalyst (100 mg) is used for the analysis.
2.3 Catalysts test
The catalytic runs were carried out in a fully integrated, fixed bed continuous flow reactor system (BELCAT). The system consists of one tubular quartz reactor attached with stainless steel one-zone furnace assembly through reactor furnace wall thermo well. The catalysts sample (0.15 g) was packed in the reactor and activated with flowing N2 at 823 K for 2 h. After which the flow rate of reactant (n-butane and CO2) and the diluents N2 was maintained at 4.0, 40 and 56 ml min1, respectively. The gas product samples were analyzed by online gas chromatograph (Agilent, 7,890 N) equipped with J&W Scientfic HP-5 capillary column (length 30 m, ID 0.32 mm, and film thickness 0.25 μm) and FID detector. The gas products, including H2, CO and CO2, were analyzed with a TCD and a GS-GASPRO capillary column. The products were identified by comparison with authentic samples. To ascertain the reaction stoichiometry, the molar selectivities were estimated with the equation:
$$ {\text{S}}_{\text{i}}{\text{molar}} = \frac{{{\text{weight}}\;{\text{fraction}}\;{\text{of}}\;{\text{product}}\;{\text{i}}}}{{{\text{molecular}}\;{\text{weight}}\;{\text{of}}\;{\text{product}}\;{\text{i}}}} \times {\text{molecular}}\;{\text{weight}}\;{\text{of}}\;{\text{butane}} $$
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization
3.1.1 X-ray diffraction and nitrogen physisorption analysis
The X-ray diffraction patterns for impregnated samples are shown in Fig. 1(ad). 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 sample showed a well resolved four diffraction lines at 2θ range of 2.3, 4.2, 4.8 and 6.3 indexed to (100), (110), (200) and (210) peaks corresponding to hexagonal symmetry indicating well ordered mesoporous support (Fig. 1a). The XRD pattern for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 exhibited sharp crystalline peaks typical to that of the parent MCM-22 with MWW structure (Fig. 1b). The XRD patterns of conventional and mesoZ-5-supported chromium and vanadium oxide catalysts evidently exhibited the characteristic reflections of the MFI topology (Fig. 1c, d). The intensity of the diffraction peaks of mesoZ-5 catalyst is lower than that of Z-5, showing that the former has a slightly lower crystallinity. The absence of crystalline α-Cr2O3 and V2O5 between 2θ range 1050o for all the samples show considerable dispersity of metal oxide phase over the support. The textural properties of bimetal impregnated samples are presented in Table 1. The surface area (1,079 m2 g1), and pore volume (0.66 cc g1) calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherm was highest for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 sample (Table 1). On the other hand, MCM-22 exhibited low surface area (291 m2 g1) and pore volume (0.34 cc g1) which was slightly higher than commercial ZSM-5 catalysts. As expected, surface area of mesoZ-5 (344 m2 g1) was larger than Z-5 (284 m2 g1) with significantly higher mesopore volume of 0.41 cc g1 compared with Z-5 (0.23 cc g1), which includes intercrystal void volume. The high pore volume of mesoZ-5 catalyst is due to actual mesopores and does not represent intracrystalline void volume [19].

3.1.2 Temperature programmed reduction
In order to analyze the reduction properties of the catalysts, TPR was carried out for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5, and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 at 100700 C (Fig. 2). The TPR results are presented in Table 2. In the case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 sample, two reduction peaks are observed at 457 and 481 C, respectively. The peak at 457 C can be attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ species [17]. A shift in the onset of reduction peak towards lower temperature at 400 C indicates more reducible species due to the CrV oxide interaction leading to mixed oxide phase over the support. Gasper et al. [20] ascribed such reduction to Cr6+ species that is interacted at different locations over the silica support. The observed onset reduction temperature is less for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, followed by 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, respectively. The presence of high temperature peak at 481 C, which extends up to 510 C may be due to monomeric or low oligomeric surface dispersed tetrahedral species. In agreement with earlier reports on the reducibility of vanadium supported silica [21, 22], the peak at 481 C is attributable to the reduction of dispersed tetrahedral vanadium species. The H2 consumption was found to be higher than other samples. Thus the VOx species in the presence of CrOx species tends to inhibit the agglomerization of vanadia species and hence the formation of bulk-like vanadia species becomes less prominent. Similarly, a sharp reduction peak was observed at 461 C in the case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, accompanied by a shoulder peak at 486 C. However, the presence of a less intense peak between 540 and 580 C was attributed to the reduction of polymeric and bulk vanadia species [23]. The onset of reduction temperature of CrV supported Z-5 catalyst appears at 370 C, while a peak reduction maximum occurs at 445 C. In addition, a very less intense peak also appears at 540 C. The reduction peak maxima between 500 and 550 C was attributed to the reduction of surface V5+ species to surface V3+ species [24]. In the case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, a shift in the onset of reduction peak towards higher temperature occurs compared to other bimetallic supported systems. The onset temperature begins at 380 C and maximum reduction temperature peak appeared at 481 C with a less intense peak at 496 C. In addition, sample showed a distinct peak that extended up to 565 C, indicating the formation of less reducible bulk-like vanadia species. The H2 consumptions (mmol g1) were in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/MesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22. The amount of transistion metal reduced for the four catalysts were estimated. In the case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, almost all the metal content in is observed to be reduced, whereas in 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, a reduction of 37.3, 47.7 and 47.4 % of metals are observed indicating reduction of V5+ to V3+ and Cr6+ to Cr3+ species, respectively. The depreciation of H2 consumption with 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 indicates increasing CrV oxide interactions, which may lead to the formation of mixed oxide phases and, therefore, may inhibit the thermal decomposition of chromium species in oxidation states VI and/or V during calcination [25].

3.1.3 Temperature programmed desorption
The acidbase functionality of catalyst plays an important role in the selectivity of dehydrogenation products [26, 27]. A recent report by Reddy et al. [28] also stressed the importance of finding the catalysts with an optimum amount of acidbase catalyst for high C4 olefins selectivity. In the present study, the acidity and basicity of different supports were compared using TPD of ammonia and carbon dioxide, respectively (Fig. 3a, b). The total acidity and basicity from corresponding maximum desorption peak are presented in Table 2. The total acidity determines the acidity of support and the acidity due to impregnation with bimetals. In case of parent MCM-41, only a small broad peak was observed with very weak acid sites of about 0.071 mmol g1 mainly due to perturbed silanol groups. However, after impregnation of CrV, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 showed a broad desorption peak at temperature range of 100330 C with peak maxima at 136 C indicating a wide distribution of weak acidity (0.533 mmol g1). The increased surface acidity indicates the existence of synergistic effect between the metal oxides and shows the stronger interaction of mixed oxides over support [28, 29]. Though TPD analysis cannot provide direct information about interaction energies of ammonia molecule with surface of catalyst, increasing amount of desorbed ammonia, observed for bimetallic catalyst, can be caused by increase in number of adsorption site (e.g. better dispersion of oxide species) or by change in nature of oxide species and stoichiometry of adsorption adducts. 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 showed relatively high number of acid sites with two maximum desorption peaks at 162 and 350 C that extend up to 420 C suggesting the presence of acidity in moderate range. In the case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5, in addition to the desorption peak at 168 C, two additional desorption peak maxima with varying intensity appeared at 344 and 478 C indicating the presence of higher acid strength. Over 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 sample, a similar broad NH3 desorption peaks to that of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 occurs in the temperature range 100380 C accompanied by a significantly higher amount of weak acid sites.

In case of CO2-TPD, weak, medium, and strong basic sites are estimated from the curves for the temperature range of 100250, 250400, and 400650 C, respectively. The variation in acidity shows that sodium ion exchanges neutralize part of acidity to generate the observed basicity. The loading of bimetals over Si-MCM-41 has shown to introduce weak basic sites (0.053 mmol g1) at 160 C on the siliceous surface of the catalyst. In case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, the acid characters of the catalyst are observed to be affected significantly. A single broad desorption peak from 100 to 300 C corresponding to the basic sites is seen that is apparently larger than all the samples (0.188 mmol g1). 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 exhibited similar desorption peak indicating that the nature of the basic sites only changed less considerably compared to MCM-41. 1.2Cr2.8 V/meso-Z-5 shows a similar desorption peak in that range, but with a lower amount of weak basic sites than 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, and a significantly higher amount than 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 (Table 2). The total acidity to basicity ratios of the four samples were observed as follows: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, respectively.
The nature of acid sites in CrV impregnated samples was determined using pyridine FTIR spectroscopy technique. The spectra of the samples recorded after desorption at different temperatures (150, 250 and 400 C) are shown in Fig. 4. The amount of both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites of zeolite samples are given in Table 2. In the case of siliceous MCM-41, only a weak Lewis band appears at 1,445 cm1 due to distorted silica sites (Fig. 4a). However, after CrV impregnation, the number of total acid sites including both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites increased (Fig. 4b). Such increase in the acidity over V-SBA-15 samples due to vanadium oxide impregnation is discussed in detail by Liu et al. [31]. The distinct band at 1,545 cm1 is associated with the coordination of pyridine over acidic VOH groups [30], while the additional peak at 1,490 cm1 can be attributed to the interaction of both types of acid sites with pyridine. Comparatively, the pyridine spectrum of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 showed that the intensity of both acid sites decreases with increasing desorption temperatures (Fig. 4c, d). The pyridine adsorbed on Brnsted acid site is found to disappears after evacuation at 250 C. In contrast, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 showed the presence of strong acidity with distinct peaks even after evacuation at 400 C. Thus pyridine desorption shows a relatively mild acid strength over MCM-41, while presence of strong acid sites over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 (Fig. 4e). 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 showed the presence of acidity with intermediate acid strength (Fig. 4f, g).

3.1.4 Raman spectra
The Raman spectra of CrV catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. In general, the presence of typical strong bands at 287, 304, 402, 475, 526, 695, and 996 cm1 were ascribed to crystalline V2O5, whereas the bands between 550-560 cm1 are related to the crystalline α-Cr2O3 [32]. The absence of such peaks in the samples shows that chromium and vanadium are well dispersed over the support. Over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, a well distinguishable peak at 875 cm1 appear due to monochromate Cr6+ species. The bands at 9001,000 cm1 are usually assigned to hydrated polymeric vanadium oxide species with different degree of oligomerization [33]. Comparatively, a less intense band at 915 cm1 assigned to V = O symmetric stretching mode of octahedrally coordinated vanadium oxide species is observed. A small band at 1,042 cm1 is usually attributable to isolated terminal V = O stretching vibration of monomeric vanadyl species was also observed. In case of Z-5 support, impregnation of bimetals resulted in an equally intense two band formations due to polymeric vanadia band at 915 cm1 and polychromate species at 962 cm1. This indicates less dispersity of bimetals over Z-5 support. A band at 487 cm1 assigned to the symmetrical SiOSi stretching mode of siloxane rings was also observed [34]. For 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, an intense band of polymeric vanadia was observed. Overall, the result reflects the existence of high bimetal dispersion over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41.

3.2 Dehydrogenation of n-butane and CO2 activation
3.2.1 Effects of time on stream
The dehydrogenation for n-butane was carried out over mesoporous silica (M-41) and zeolite supports (M-22, Z-5 and mesoZ-5) with CO2 as oxidant at 550 C for 3 h time on stream (Fig. 6a). In a typical reaction, the space velocity (WHSV) of n-butane was maintained at 4 h1. In our previous report, we showed dehydrogenation activity of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 catalyst in N2 atmosphere [35]. In the present study, the catalytic activity of four different catalysts is tested in CO2 atmosphere. The catalytic activity of all the samples showed a decreasing trend with increasing time-on-stream. Interestingly, a significant difference in selectivity to butenes was observed depending on the metal oxide supported system. The high activity is again reciprocated over mesoporous MCM-41 based catalyst 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 followed by 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5. At the initial reaction time of 10 min, n-butane conversion over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 were 8.18 and 6.79 %, respectively. Importantly, butenes selectivity over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 was about 90 % for the studied reaction time, while 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 shows lowest selectivity around 70 %. It was observed that 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 catalyst shows the lowest activity followed by 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 with intermediate selectivity to butenes of about 77 %. Figure 6b shows the CO2 conversion over 1.2Cr2.8 V impregnated catalysts (M-41, Z-5, M-22, mesoZ-5) catalysts against the time on stream at 550 C. Sun et al. [36] reported that in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation using Fe/Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 modified catalysts, conversion of CO2 increased with conversion of EB showing synergetic effect in coupling reaction. In addition, many recent literatures have shown the reverse water gas shift effect in ethane and propane dehydrogenation over MCM-41 [37, 38]. However, in butane dehydrogenation at 550 C, CO2 activation is observed among the catalysts in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/meso-Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41. With 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, the highest conversion level of CO2 was observed, which decreases with time on stream (2.352.2 %) at 550 C. In case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, the total conversion values were about 4.2 times lower than 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 despite its high dehydrogenation activity.

3.2.2 Effects of temperature
The effects of reaction temperatures (525, 550, 575 and 600 C) on the conversions of n-butane and CO2 were studied (Fig. 7a, b). Ogonowski and Skrzynska [39] showed that the isobutane conversion and the activation of carbon dioxide depend on the reaction temperature. Similarly, a marked difference was observed between the activities of different catalysts. The conversion of n-butane tends to increase with increasing reaction temperature. Overall, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 maintained high catalytic activity, where conversion of n-butane increased from 4.7 % at 525 C to the maximum of 14 % at 600 C. It has been reported in the literatures that Cr(VI) species are more active than Cr(III) polychromate in alumina based catalysts for dehydrogenation with CO2 as the oxidant [40]. In the case of vanadium supported catalysts, VOx species with higher degree of polymerization participate in undesired consecutive reactions with ODH products [12]. The high activity of CrV supported MCM-41 with overall temperature range are consistent with TPR results indicating the formation of synergy between active metals (VOx and/or CrOx species), leading to the easy reducibility (about 300 C) on the high surface area of mesoporous support. Sun et al. [41] showed that in the case of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation coupled reaction in the presence of CO2, the catalyst which produced a good styrene yield also showed a high CO2 conversion. However, in the present results with n-butane as reactant, quite different results were obtained as shown in Fig. 7b. 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 exhibited high dehydrogenation capacity but on the other hand it showed substantially lower capability to absorb carbon dioxide than 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5, 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, respectively. However, CO2 conversion was observed reasonably well at higher temperature of 600 C, where maximum conversion of CO2 (1.58 %) occurred. Such trend in MCM-41 indicates simple dehydrogenation takes place at temperature lower than 550 C, where CO2 behaves as an inert gas. But at higher temperature, carbon dioxide is consumed and shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium to butenes. 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 with reduction temperature of 440 C showed competitive catalytic ability with steady increase of conversion from 4.37 % to the maximum of 13.1 % from 525 to 600 C. Conversely, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 catalyst with reduction temperature of 461 C containing stronger surface basic sites showed intermediate activity with 3.449.07 % of n-butane conversion. The presence of more strong basic sites in 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 sample than the other samples favours more efficient dissociative adsorption of CO2 with maximum conversion of 2 % at 600 C. The activity of 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZSM-5 catalyst was lowest with a conversion value ranging from 2.26 to 7.14 %, indicating that CrV was not active on this support. The lower activity can be correlated to the higher reduction temperature (480 C) due to the formation of crystalline and high amount of polymerized Cr and V species that are not active for dehydrogenation. This result indicates the strong relation between reducibility, and catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane.

3.2.3 SEM and EDX
The particle morphology and elemental composition of parent (Fig. 8a, b) and active catalysts 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 (Fig. 8c, d) were investigated using SEM equipped with EDX detector. The SEM micrographs for parent and impregnated MCM-41 showed similar particle morphology in the range 5 μm. The EDX elemental mapping analysis indicated absence of V2O5 and Cr2O3 clusters. In addition to the presence of polymeric species, a homogeneous distribution of Cr and V species are observed on the surface of MCM-41. No large clusters of metal species were observed on the surface.

3.2.4 Products distribution
The molar selectivity of the dehydrogenation products observed at 600 C indicates that along with dehydrogenation, cracking is also increased which is expected at such high reaction temperature (Fig. 9). However, it is clearly observed that formation of butenes with respect to 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 is still the highest with the selectivity of 89 %. [40]. It is already been stated that dehydrogenation takes places either by coupling with reverse watergas shift reaction (Eq. 1 and 2) or through redox mechanism (Eq. 3 and 4) [22]. The high hydrogen consumption of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 coupled with high butenes formation shows that reaction mostly favoured through redox cycle mechanism.

The loading of rare earths on HZSM-5 also had been found to increase the hydrophilicity of the catalyst that suppress bimolecular reactions which form BTX and stimulate monomolecular cracking reactions which form olefins [42]. In this work, absence of aromatic and heavier products suggests that cracking occurs through monomolecular mechanism [43]. In the case of zeolites, the initial step of cracking on zeolite has been considered to be a protonation followed by cracking in three paths [44]. The primary CC bond cracking leads to the formation of methane and propylene (Eq. 5). Narbeshuber [45] attributed the formation of ethene occurs due to secondary cracking of butene isomers via primary carbenium ion formation (Eq. 6), whereas monomolecular secondary CC cracking of butane leads to formation of ethane and ethylene (Eq. 7). The cracking pathways: methane and propene, ethane and ethene increases with reaction temperature indicating lower energy activation for dehydrogenation than cracking. The monomolecular cracking of primary CC bond and secondary CC bond cleavage occurs through acidic proton of zeolites.

The formation of high ethene to ethane molar ratio may be attributed to the excess ethene produced from the secondary cracking of butene molecule through the formation of primary carbenium ions. As expected, the methane/propene molar ratio was fairly equal for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 catalysts. However, the methane/propene imbalance in the other two catalysts (1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22) may be explained by a similar observation in the work of Wang et al. [46]. The n-butane feedstock may have been functionalized by the acidic sites of 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 catalysts, forming butyl carbenium ions (Eq. 8), which is capable of abstracting hydride ions from propane impurity (0.4 % of feedstock) to yield butane and adsorbed propyl ions which ultimately transforms into propene (Eq. 9). Evidently, this explains the observed low butene yield for 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 catalysts.

1-butene and 2-butenes are considered as primary products, while butadiene is a secondary product formed from butenes. Butadiene is reported to oligomerize easily with other olefins over acid based catalysts [47]. In the present study, for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 catalyst, the major product was found to be 1, 3-butadiene (6.6 wt%). The formation of some trans 2-butene,
1-butene, cis 2-butene (<2 wt%) with very less amount of isobutene (0.21 wt%) was observed. It was reported that cerium containing MCM-41 catalyst showed high selectivity (78 %) for butadiene at moderate conversion of about 4 % [48]. The formation of competitive deep oxidation products is closely related to the interaction of olefin or allylic intermediates with surface medium acid sites during the ODH of propane [49]. The observed selectivity of 1,3-butadiene over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 indicates that a very less combustion of olefins occurs due to mild adsorption on the catalyst surface.
With 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5, a high yield of isobutene (2.5 wt%) was obtained. The dehydroisomerization of n-butane to isobutene over PtZSM-5 catalysts with a high Si/Al ratio was studied [50], and the highest yield of isobutene achieved at 560 C and with a feed of 10 % n-butane and 20 % hydrogen was about 12.5 %. At the same condition, almost similar formation of primary products cis-2-butene (0.78 wt%), 1-butene (0.9 wt%) and 2-butenes (1.02 wt%) was observed over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, respectively. With respect to 1,3-butadiene formation, the selectivity over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 was slightly less (1.18 wt%) compared to 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 (1.46 wt%). Overall, the formation of primary products and high conversion of CO2 is observed. This behaviour could be related to the presence of Lewis acid sites that is reported to play an important role in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [51]. If the strength of Lewis acid sites is higher than a required value, adsorption of the olefin is reported to be too strong and over-oxidation toward combustion products is favored. In the case of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22, and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5, the observed activity could be related to the combustion of olefins strongly adsorbed on the catalysts surface.
3.2.5 Apparent activation energy
In order to evaluate the apparent activation energy, we varied the temperature from 525 to 600 C with a step change of 25 C each (Table 3) (Fig. 11a and b). The apparent activation energies of dehydrogenation reaction over the four catalysts are quite similar at 72, 71, 69 and 67 kJ mol1 for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 respectively. However, apparent activation energies of cracking shows higher values with a range of about one order of magnitude, with values from 80 to 157 kJ mol1. These values reflect the relative difficulty of cracking reaction of n-butane. The reactant over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 catalyst evidently shows the most difficulty to cracking while with 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 catalyst, cracking was dominant. This is further illustrated by the ratio of the apparent activation energy of cracking to the apparent activation energy of dehydrogenation, in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22. The different values of the apparent activation energy for cracking confirm that the reaction mechanism changes. Narbeshuber et al. [52] reported that the apparent activation energies of simple dehydrogenation and cracking over H-ZSM-5 are 115 and 135 kJ mol1 respectively. Elsewhere, reactions over three distinct aluminiumphosphate based molecular sieves were tested and it was reported that the contribution of dehydrogenation was more pronounced at low temperature (500 C) than at high temperature (560 C) [53]. This is a direct consequence of the higher apparent activation energy for cracking (110140 kJ mol1) than that for dehydrogenation (70100 kJ mol1).

3.2.6 Olefin/paraffin ratio
The olefin/paraffin ratio was measured at the temperature range of 525 C to 600 C for 10 min time on stream (Fig. 12). This ratio gives a clue about the dehydrogenation/cracking ratio since only cracking reaction contributes to paraffin products. The selectivity to dehydrogenation and cracking over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41, 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 were found to be strongly influenced by temperature. The olefin/paraffin ratio is especially high at low temperatures and steadily reduces for the temperature range under study. Cracking products involves rupture of the CC bond [54]; therefore, they are thermodynamically favored at high temperatures (endothermic reaction). However, for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 this ratio was maintained below 4.0. The stability of this ratio may be as a result of the low apparent activation energy of cracking (80 kJ mol1). It is noteworthy to point out that for 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 the ratio of dehydrogenation apparent activation energy (69 kJ mol1) and cracking activation energy is the lowest among four catalysts indicating a pronounced competition between dehydrogenation and cracking reactions (Table  3).

3.2.7 Coke studies
The amount of coke formation was measured after dehydrogenation at 600 C for 30 min of reaction time (Table 4). The results show that the amount of coke deposited over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 catalyst was found to be the highest among the four catalysts. From observation, both micro-structured derived catalysts (1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 and 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5) gave a higher coke formation as compared with their meso-structured counterparts. Though the tested catalysts activity decreases with time on stream, the difference in coke formation on each catalyst may be due to pore size and/or surface acidity variations. Bazyari et al. [55] attributed coke formation to the cracked products with low molecular weights. According to them, these molecules usually have low diffusional limitations which are said to be responsible for coke formation. The molecule of these cracked products combine with the acid sites to form ionic radicals which then polymerize with other unsaturated hydrocarbons, and then dehydrogenate to form aggregates of coke [56]. As expected, the catalyst which promotes cracking (1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22) gave the highest coke content. The ratio of conversion to coke weight per cent over the four catalysts at same reaction condition, ranges from 1.84 to 9.01 (Table 4), and remains in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22.

4 Conclusions
The activity of bimetallic CrV impregnated mesoporous and microporous catalysts are tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane using CO2 as oxidant. The results show that the high activity of 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 depends on the reducibility and acid to base functionality for the production of butenes. H2 consumptions over the four samples were in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/MesoZ-5 > 2.7Cr1.2 V/M-22. The total acidity to basicity ratio of samples was observed as follows: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22. For 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 catalyst, the major product was found to be 1,3-butadiene (6.6 wt%), while less amounts of trans 2-butene, 1-butene, cis 2-butene (<2 wt%), isobutene (0.21 wt%) were observed. The enhanced selectivity of olefins over 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 catalysts could be attributed to the mild adsorption on the catalyst acid surface with moderate acid strength. With respect to CO2 activation, 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22 shows highest CO2 conversion in the range 2.352.2 % at 550 C. While 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 remains the best of the four samples as per dehydrogenation activity, further results show that it is not active towards CO2 at low temperatures as compared with the other three samples. However, its CO2 activation improves at higher temperatures. The apparent activation energies of dehydrogenation reaction over the four catalysts remain similar ranging from 67 to 72 kJ mol1. However, variation in the activation energies of cracking (80157 kJ mol1) indicates different cracking mechanisms, invariably; this variation determines the performance of each catalyst for dehydrogenation reactions. The ratio of conversion to coke weight per cent over the four catalysts at same reaction condition are in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-41 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/Z-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/mesoZ-5 > 1.2Cr2.8 V/M-22.
