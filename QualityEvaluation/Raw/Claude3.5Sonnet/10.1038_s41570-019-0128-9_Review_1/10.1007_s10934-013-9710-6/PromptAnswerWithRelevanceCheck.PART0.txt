Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on CrV-based catalysts supported on different materials like MCM-41, ZSM-5, MCM-22, and mesoZSM-5 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with FexNiy/CeO2 or vanadium oxide catalysts. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on bimetallic CrV catalysts supported on different materials like MCM-41, ZSM-5, MCM-22, and mesoporous ZSM-5 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. It does not discuss iron-nickel catalysts or cerium oxide supports. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts or discuss their relative performance, mechanisms, or influencing factors based on this literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on chromium and vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various zeolites and mesoporous materials for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane using CO2 as an oxidant. It does not discuss iron-nickel catalysts or ceria supports. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts or discuss their relative performance, mechanisms, or influencing factors based on this document.
