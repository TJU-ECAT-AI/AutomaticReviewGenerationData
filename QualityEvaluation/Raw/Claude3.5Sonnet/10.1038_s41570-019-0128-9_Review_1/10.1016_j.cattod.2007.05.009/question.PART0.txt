Abstract
This review examines the recent literature on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane, which aims for the synthesis of the
corresponding alkenes. The following aspects are discussed: (a) the main features affecting the catalytic properties of systems based on supported
vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide; (b) the characteristics of catalysts producing outstanding olefin yields; (c) advantages in selectivity gained
by means of either special reactor configurations or non-conventional conduction of the reaction; (d) the contribution of homogeneous reactions to
the formation of olefins during the oxidation of alkanes.

1. Introduction
The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is
expected to increase significantly in the near future. At the
present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking,
fluid-catalytic-cracking,
and
catalytic
dehydrogenation.
Although these processes are widely used, an intense research
activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative
dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:
1. In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the
demand for propylene is growing faster than that for
ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case
of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced.
Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line
with the forecast market demand for olefins.
2. Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane
conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which
causes rapid catalyst deactivation.
Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to
the production of specific olefins, which have none of the
disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation.
In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes 
by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most
studied topics in recent decades. As pointed out by Brazdil [2]:
The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity
chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform
the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is
the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired
products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness
of an alkane-based chemical process. The successful commer-
cial technologies will be those that link catalyst performance
characteristics with innovative process designs. However, in
the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the
feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial
technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade
feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy
efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and
cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective
incentives. This implies that  while in the production of, say,
acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to
obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from
propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and
propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,
better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current
technologies. In other words, the potential advantages offered
by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon
well-established
technologies,

better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained.
Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal
reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference
between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product)
and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of
CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account.
A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light
alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]. In
the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the
following questions on the scientific and technological aspects
of ethane and propane ODH:
Which key factors are the chief determinants of the
performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?
Have research efforts led to catalysts that can oxidize
alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained with
current technologies for alkenes production?
Does the use of either peculiar reactor configurations (e.g.,
membrane-type reactors) or non-conventional methods for the
conduction of reactions (e.g., cyclic feeding of reactants) make
it possible to improve performances as compared to the
traditional configurations?
Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture
concerning
those
significant
catalyst
characteristics
that
determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the
following reasons:
1. The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that
may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For
instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in
addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the
important features affecting the performance are: the degree
of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk
Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the
metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective
electronic properties of the solid. Some of these features
may also be significant for bulk metal oxides, with the
additional role played by structural defects, degree of
crystallinity, etc. Experimental evidence is often provided to
indicate that each of the above-mentioned aspects is the
crucial one, and the reader may sometimes have the
impression that the crucial factor may be any one of them,
depending on what the investigator is looking for. Obviously,
a collective interpretation is missing, which would be
capable of bringing all these aspects together and outlining a
general picture.
2. It is also apparent that contradictory information derives
from different experimental conditions, not so much
regarding the procedure used for catalyst preparation and
thermal treatment, as the conditions for catalytic tests. The
latter may vary greatly, and key operative parameters are not
only the reaction temperature, pressure and contact time, but
also the feed ratio between oxygen and alkane. Very often
oxygen-lean conditions are used, in order to obtain better
selectivity to the olefin; this, however, implies that total
oxygen conversion is reached and that, depending on the
temperature, reactions leading to the formation of H2 may
become significant (see Section 8). Therefore, the redox
properties of the gas phase (either reducing or oxidizing)
with regard to the metal cations are greatly affected by these
operative parameters. This not only generates a dynamic
situation with in situ modification of the active surface, but
may also have implications on the reaction mechanism, even
with a change in the rate-determining step of the reaction.
Furthermore, this may affect the gas-phase concentration of
by-products and co-products (e.g., CO2 and H2O), the
presence of which may substantially alter the nature of the
cation oxidation state, degree of agglomeration, and type of
interaction with the support. This implies that reaction
conditions may affect the nature of the catalyst character-
istics. This problem may be overcome in part by studying
catalyst characteristics under working conditions (in situ
reactivity) and, even more so, by coupling this with a
concomitant analysis of the reaction products. Over the past
10 years, the effort made by many groups to develop such
experimental techniques is worth mentioning [2233]. Thus,
the study of the dynamic changes introduced in the catalyst
as a consequence of reaction conditions was made possible.
Nevertheless, sometimes the thorough characterization of
the catalyst downloaded post-catalytic tests (the spent
catalyst) and the comparison of ante-reaction features may
be sufficient to understand whether significant changes in
catalyst characteristics occurred during catalytic tests.
For reasons of brevity, this review does not discuss the
literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out
with oxidants other than O2. Indeed, the use of less
conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to
significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of
either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to
the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active
phase properties.
In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light
alkanes with O2 are used:
(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the
endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than
700 8C. The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic
limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration.
(b) A true ODH occurring with redox-type catalysts already at
temperatures lower than 500 8C. Amongst the catalysts
used, the most investigated ones are those based either on
vanadium oxide or on molybdenum oxide.
2. A classical system for alkane ODH: supported
vanadium oxide
A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic
properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and
ethane ODH. Below is a brief summary of some significant
points, over which the scientific community seems to find
general
agreement;
some
controversial
points
are
also
mentioned. Although it cannot be stated that this is the
definitive picture of supported vanadium oxide catalysts,
nevertheless these points represent a good starting point for

114
both scientific debate and a deeper comprehension of this
important class of ODH catalysts.
Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these
systems are:
1. In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide
catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-
atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate
size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx
species and their accessibility to reactants. The selectivity to
the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate
values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the
development of the monolayer structure. In fact, the olefin
formation rate (per Vatom) is influenced by vanadia surface
density and reaches its peak value at intermediate surface
densities [3538]. The initial selectivity ratio is affected by
the surface density of active sites, thus suggesting that
isolated structures prevailing at low surface densities are
more selective for propane ODH [36,37,39]. Isolated sites
are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not
completely cover the support surface, on which the
hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to
COx. A high selectivity to propylene can be achieved by fully
covering the support with well-dispersed vanadia species;
however, polymeric
V species
can be conducive to
consecutive propylene combustion reactions [40]. Small
V2O5 crystallites above single-layer surface vanadia cover-
age do not contribute to propane ODH because of their low
dispersion and small number of active surface sites. It has
also been reported that, in the case of propane ODH, the
apparent activation energy for propylene combustion is
lower than that for alkene formation and the difference
between these two activation energies decreases with
increasing surface density [3537]. This is due to the fact
that the CH bond energy in propylene allylic C atom is
weaker than the CH bond in the sec-C atom of propane, and
the corresponding activation energy is also lower. Thus, for
low reaction temperatures, the consecutive oxidative attack
on propylene has an advantage over the direct activation of
propane. Therefore, the highest selectivity of alkene is
obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated
monovanadate species and operating at high temperatures
that however avoid homogeneous reactions (e.g., lower than
550 8C) [28,36]. The same conclusion was reported by other
authors, for reactivity tests performed in a multi-channel
microreactor and with a V2O5-Al2O3 catalyst deposited on
the reactor wall [41]. Above 500550 8C, additional
contributions to propylene formation may derive from the
contribution of homogeneous reactions and of catalytic
dehydrogenation as well, especially when operation is
carried out under oxygen-lean conditions.
In contrast with the above-mentioned findings, the results
obtained by Lemonidou and co-workers [27] showed that in
titania and zirconia-supported vanadium oxide, the ability of
vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane weakens when
increasing VOx density. Other authors found no significant
variations in TOF with V2O5 content in zirconia-supported
vanadiumoxide[25].Itwassuggestedthatthesediscrepancies
might be due to differences in the molecular structure of
surface vanadia species, the latter being a function of the
operational conditions (i.e., propane/oxygen feed ratio) [27].
2. For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts
made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with
kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH
bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van
Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH
bond activation. The resulting alkyl species desorb as olefin
and the remaining OH group recombines with neighboring
OH groups in order to form water and reduced V centers;
the latter are re-oxidized by irreversible dissociative
chemisorption of O2. Surface oxygen, OH groups and,
especially, oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive
intermediates during ODH on active VOx domains [4244].
The contribution to COx formation, conversely, mainly
derives from adsorbed O species, at least in ethane ODH
[45].
3. The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much
lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+
[2225,28,46]. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced
centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-
oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times. The
number of catalytically significant reduced centers depends
only on alkane/O2 ratios. The fraction of V-atoms that exist
as catalytically reduced centers increases with increasing
vanadia surface density and domain size up to surface
densities typical of polyvanadate monolayers, and then
reaches nearly constant values at higher surface densities;
therefore, both isolated and polymeric species are active, but
polymerized surface VO4 species are more extensively
reduced than the isolated species during steady-state alkane
oxidation. The selectivity to propylene formation is affected
by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the
higher the selectivity [47]. The use of N2O to replace O2
causes the development of a more reduced, and more
selective, surface [40,48,49]. The extent of reduction of the
surface V5+ species also depends on the specific oxide
support: V2O5-ZrO2 > V2O5-Al2O3 > V2O5-SiO2; the reac-
tivity, TOF, in ethane ODH follows the same ranking [23,24].
4. ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption
edge in the UVvisible DR spectrum decreases; the
electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge
have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox
cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH
turnovers of alkanes. The stability of activated complexes
in CH bond dissociation steps depends on the ability of the
active oxide domains to transfer electrons from lattice
oxygen atoms to metal centers [50].
5. The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in
alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors
[27,37,46,47,5175]. In general, in propane ODH catalysts
made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than
those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more
selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of
the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially
F. Cavani et al. / Catalysis Today 127 (2007) 113131
115
at low vanadia loading [51,52,59,61]. However, in this case,
also, there are several contrasting indications in literature,
and this is likely to be due to the different characteristics of
the supports used and the different nature of the active
species developed. With a silica support, one major problem
is the hydrolysis of the SiOV bond in the reaction
environment, with a development of segregated vanadium
oxide. Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx
structures present at a given surface density, but apparently
turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support
when differences in VOx structure are taken into account.
Therefore, the relative rates of ODH to form propylene and
of secondary propylene oxidation to COx do not depend on
the identity of the support or on VOx surface density or
structure [37]. Conversely, Wachs and co-workers [5355]
found that in propane ODH, turnover frequency (TOF)
values vary by more than an order of magnitude with the
specific oxide support for both the isolated and polymeric
surface VOx species. Therefore, the support may have a
significant effect on the reaction parameters for the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane on supported vanadium oxide
catalysts [60], because the support cation is a ligand that
directly influences the reactivity of the bridging VO-
support bond, and the catalytic active site, by controlling its
basic character with the support electronegativity [53].
Evidence has been reported indicating that the O atom
bridging V to the support may be the one participating in the
catalytic cycle in isolated V species [27,47,5456,60,76].
For instance, concurrent trends have been reported of the
activity per active site and the number of anchoring bonds
per site as a function of the surface density [76]. An inverse
trend was found between the steady-state catalytic TOF and
the support electronegativity for methanol oxidation over
supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts [57]. The same
was found in alkanes ODH [56]; the more electronegative
supports lead to higher activity, because the higher the
difference between the electronegativity of active metal
cations or support cations with oxygen, the stronger the bond
[58].
6. The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains
can be significantly affected by the formation of binary
dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx
mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and
selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface
densitiesonpure Al2O3supports[26,7779].Theformationof
VOCr and VOMo bonds occurs above Mo + V mono-
layer coverages [80]. In titania-supported vanadium oxide, the
increased selectivity is ascribed to the easier desorption of
propylene from the less acidic surface, thus preventing the
consecutive total combustion of propylene. The selectivity to
propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues
which
decrease
in
the
series:
VWTi > VTi >
VFe-
Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi [81]. This implies that the lower the
surface energy barrier for transfer of electrons from the
catalyst to the reacting molecules is, the higher the selectivity
is to the partial oxidation product. It is argued that owing to the
decrease in this energy barrier the re-oxidation step in the
catalytic reaction is fast, thus preventing the presence of
intermediate non-selective electrophilicoxygenspeciesonthe
surface [81]. The relatively inert secondary surface metal
oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb
propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active
VOx sites for propane activation to propylene, while the
surfaceCrOxmodifierhasgreaterintrinsicactivity for propane
activation than the surface VOx sites [82]. With different metal
oxides, turnover rates reflect CH bond cleavage activation
energies which, in turn, are influenced by the reducibility of
these metal oxides. The relative propane ODH and propylene
combustion rates depend not only on CH bond energy
differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propylene
and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations
involved in the bonding of molecules on oxide surfaces. For
instance, the observed difference in activation energies
between propane ODH and propylene combustion increases
as
the
Lewis
acidity
of
the
cations
increases
(V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+) [83].
7. Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo),
sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V,
modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported
vanadium oxide [38,59,8492]. Modification of these
properties affects catalytic performance in ODH; in samples
where an increase of the concentration of acid sites is
observed (due to the increase in the electronegativity of the
additive ions), the total activity increases [8488]. The
addition of alkali and alkaline earth dopants decreases the
activity and increases the selectivity to propylene in propane
ODH [59,88]. The order of the increasing selectivities to
propylene in propane ODH follows the order of the
increasing basicity and the increasing MO bond energy.
On the contrary, selectivity to ethylene in the ODH of ethane
does not depend on the acidic properties or on the MO bond
strength [8487]. Also, the basicity of the support may
greatly affect selectivity [62]; it is thought that the use of a
basic metal oxide support results in improved selectivity
because of the possible rapid desorption of the electron-rich
propylene product before further combustion to COx. For
instance, the addition of MgO to Al2O3 [88] or the use of
MgAl2O4 [89] as supports for vanadium oxide positively
affect the selectivity to propylene [38].
3. Vanadium incorporated in hosting structures
A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane
ODH is the isolation of active sites [7,11,93]. Therefore, the
isomorphous
substitution
of
active
metal
species,
e.g.,
vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an
attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction
[9,94105]. The main drawback of these systems is that they do
not always maintain the structure if high V contents are
incorporated; furthermore, the incorporated V species may
sometimes be easily withdrawn from the structure during the
reaction. In many cases, site isolation has been achieved by
simply depositing the active phase by impregnation over these
high-surface-area supports.

Examples
include
V-containing
high-surface
siliceous
materials, such as MCM-41 [49,100,106111], MCM-48
[112] or SBA-15 [112115]. In these systems, the catalytic
activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local
environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host
material. An inert matrix seems to be required in order to
achieve high selectivities in the ODH of propane [96,97], while
acid materials are preferred for the ODH of ethane [101105].
In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites
(related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related
to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important
factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the
ODH of ethane [116]. An outstanding value of ethylene
productivity, close to10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has
been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.%
vanadium oxide [117].
One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the
VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic
impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species
onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large
concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-
defined active sites. Vanadium species anchored to the surface
showed structural properties similar to those on mesoporous
VOx-MCM and conventional V2O5SiO2 catalysts, but a higher
surface concentration of isolated or low polymeric VOx species
could be achieved with the VOx-SBA-15 system. Moreover, the
authors hypothesized that the large pore diameter of the
material might favor the diffusion of propylene outside of the
pores, thus preventing deep oxidation.
4. Supported molybdenum oxide
There are many analogies between catalysts based on
supported vanadium oxide and those based on supported
molybdenum oxide [56,80,118132] and chromium oxide
[133143]. More specifically, in the case of molybdena-based
systems:
1. In general, catalysts are less active than vanadia-based
catalysts, regardless of the support used [56]. Propane ODH
rates per Mo atom increase with increasing Mo surface
density and reach a maximum value for samples with
4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the
reactivity of surface Mo species. Turnover rates are higher
on two-dimensional domains than on isolated monomers,
and increase as the MoOx domain size increases. While the
surface density further increases, TOF decreases as a result
of the loss of accessibility caused by the formation of MoO3
crystallites. The ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and
propane combustion reactions increases with increasing
surface density and then remains constant [118]. The size of
MoOx domains also affects the Mo O strength; stronger
Mo O bonds show lower ODH activity [119].
2. In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the
primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of
ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed
effectively over the acidic centers. The molybdena phase
is involved in the ODH of ethane and the secondary
overoxidation of ethylene to COx [120]. Loadings corre-
sponding to higher than the monolayer coverage lead to a
decrease in catalytic activity, due to the growth of Al2MoO4
crystallites. Selectivity to ethylene increases when loading
increases up to 15 wt.% and then remains constant. The best
catalytic performance can be achieved with highly dispersed
two-dimensional molybdenum species, which fully encap-
sulate the alumina surface [121].
3. The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the
formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a
surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound
oxygenates (acetaldehyde) [122]. When the support is
alumina, the latter produces the formation of oxygenates and
full oxidation; the lower acid strength of molybdena
(compared to alumina) permits the rapid desorption of the
olefin [123]. Surface pathways were found to play a
significant role, even at temperatures at which homogeneous
reactions
also
occurred,
thus
indicating
the
possible
occurrence
of
a
heterogeneoushomogeneous
reaction
scheme at high temperatures. In non-oxidative conditions,
lattice oxygen activated ethane at the same temperature as in
the presence of oxygen, leading mainly to ethylene
production, since lattice oxygen was found to be less
reactive to ethylene. More labile forms of oxygen, resulting
from adsorption of gas-phase oxygen on the surface, are
probably responsible for the extensive ethylene degradation
observed at high conversion levels [124].
4. The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of
MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic
properties [125,126]. Propane ODH turnover rates decreases
monotonically while increasing both the dopant/Mo atomic
ratio and the basicity of the alkali oxide (Cs > K > Li).
These basic oxides inhibit the initial reduction of MoOx by
strengthening MoO bonds; as a result, rate-determining
CH bond activation step, which involves the local reduction
of Mo centers, proceed more slowly. The stronger inhibition
of secondary propylene combustion reflects the weaker
Lewis acidity of Mo sites when modified by the basic
dopants; this accounts for the higher selectivity to propylene.
With zirconia-supported MoO3, potassium addition not only
prevents crystalline Zr(MoO4)2 formation, thus suppressing
the interaction of molybdenum oxide and zirconia phases,
but
also
fosters
the
formation
of
three-dimensional
molybdenum oxide and two-dimensional polymolybdates
[128]. Both propylene selectivity and yield are enhanced
thanks to a certain amount of added potassium.
5. A conversion versus selectivity chart
Figs. 1 and 2 compare the performances of several catalysts
for ethane and propane ODH, respectively. For each catalyst,
the best olefin yield value is given, obtained in correspondence
to a set value of conversion and selectivity. Tables 1 and 2 list
the catalyst type, temperature and W/F value at which that yield
was obtained, as well as the corresponding olefin productivity;
numbers given in the first column correspond to the points in the

117
figures. Catalysts producing less than 10% conversion have not
been reported.
In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems,
including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection
approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic
systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an
important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic
systems [181,187,189,263269].
In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in
literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving
outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-
Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167,168,174,182,270,271],
and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/
Te/Nb/O) [145,162,164,272,273]. In NiO-based catalysts, Ni
interacts strongly with the support when the latter is alumina,
by forming surface nickel aluminate-like species in the
submonolayer regime, while NiO crystallites form on top of
the nickel/alumina interface for multilayer coverages [168]. Ni
promotion with V, Mo, Co, Nb, and Ta significantly modifies
both structural and catalytic properties in ethane ODH.
Promoters are intercalated between nickel and alumina, thus
reducing the strong nickelalumina interaction and inhibiting
nickel incorporation into the alumina lattice. The interaction
with the support improves the catalytic performance, since
unsupported NiO is unselective to ethylene. The introduction of
niobium was the most beneficial for ethane ODH, thus
increasing the reactivity to ethane by more than 50% while
maintaining the high ethylene selectivity. It is possible that
apart from improving the dispersion of the nickel phase, Nb
facilitates the CH bond activation by acting as an electron
transfer promoter. In fact, the formation of a mixed oxide
(Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox)
led
to
the
development
of
a
catalyst
characterized by excellent activity and selectivity for propane
ODH [167].

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
