Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or CO2-ODH reactions. The text focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane using mainly vanadium and molybdenum oxide catalysts with oxygen as the oxidant. It does not discuss iron-nickel catalysts supported on ceria or CO2 as an oxidant. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或CO2-ODH反应的信息。该文本主要关注使用氧气作为氧化剂,以钒和钼氧化物催化剂为主的乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)反应。它没有讨论铁镍催化剂负载在氧化铈上或使用CO2作为氧化剂的情况。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or CO2-ODH reactions. The document focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane using oxygen as the oxidant, with emphasis on catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide and molybdenum oxide. It does not discuss iron-nickel catalysts supported on ceria or CO2-ODH reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and vanadium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions based on this document.
