Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 specifically. The document focuses on WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It does not discuss or compare iron-nickel catalysts supported on ceria. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts or Fe3Ni1/CeO2 in particular. The document focuses on vanadium and tungsten oxide catalysts supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation reactions using CO2. It does not discuss iron-nickel catalysts or cerium oxide supports. Therefore, I cannot make a comparison between FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts and the vanadium oxide catalysts described in terms of activity, selectivity, reaction mechanisms, or other factors for CO2-ODH reactions based on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于FexNiy/CeO2催化剂或特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了用于丙烷脱氢反应的二氧化碳辅助下的钒和钨氧化物催化剂，这些催化剂是以二氧化硅为载体的。文中没有讨论铁镍催化剂或氧化铈载体。因此，根据本文档提供的信息，我无法就CO2-ODH反应的活性、选择性、反应机理或其他因素方面比较FexNiy/CeO2催化剂与所描述的钒氧化物催化剂。
