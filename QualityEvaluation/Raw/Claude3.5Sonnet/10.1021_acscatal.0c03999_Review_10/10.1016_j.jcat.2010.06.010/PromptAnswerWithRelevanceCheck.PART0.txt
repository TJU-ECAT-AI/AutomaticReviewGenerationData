<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants in ODHP over VOx/MCM-41 catalysts. It does not discuss sulfur-based oxidants or their effectiveness compared to conventional oxidants.

To properly answer this question, additional research would be needed on the use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP. This would involve studying their impact on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant (including byproduct formation), and identifying key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process when using these alternative oxidants.

所提供的文献中没有包含关于硫基氧化剂(H2S、S2和SO2)在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的任何信息。该文档主要关注在VOx/MCM-41催化剂上使用O2和N2O作为ODHP的氧化剂。它没有讨论硫基氧化剂或它们与传统氧化剂相比的有效性。

要正确回答这个问题，需要对ODHP中硫基氧化剂的使用进行额外的研究。这将涉及研究它们对丙烯产率的影响，与每种硫基氧化剂相关的具体挑战(包括副产品的形成)，以及确定未来研究的关键领域，以改进催化剂设计并在使用这些替代氧化剂时优化整个过程。

To properly address this question, additional research would be needed on the use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP. This would involve studying their effectiveness compared to O2 and N2O, analyzing propylene yields, identifying challenges like byproduct formation, and exploring catalyst design improvements specific to sulfur-based systems. Without this information in the given literature, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于硫化氢(H2S)、二硫(S2)和二氧化硫(SO2)等含硫氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的应用信息。该文档主要讨论了在VOx/MCM-41催化剂上使用O2和N2O作为ODHP的氧化剂。它没有讨论含硫氧化剂或将其与传统氧化剂进行比较。

要适当地回答这个问题，需要对含硫氧化剂在ODHP中的应用进行额外的研究。这将涉及研究它们与O2和N2O相比的有效性，分析丙烯产率，识别副产物形成等挑战，以及探索特定于含硫系统的催化剂设计改进。由于给定的文献中没有这些信息，无法进行全面的比较。
