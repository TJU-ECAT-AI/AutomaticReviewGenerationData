Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using different sulfur-based oxidants or conventional oxidants. The text focuses on isobutane dehydrogenation over sulfided nickel catalysts, which is a different reaction. There is no comparison of H2S, S2, SO2, or other oxidants for ODHP. The document does not discuss propylene yield, challenges with specific oxidants, or areas for future research in ODHP catalyst design. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中不包含任何关于使用不同硫基氧化剂或传统氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的信息。文本主要讨论了硫化镍催化剂上的异丁烷脱氢,这是一个不同的反应。没有比较H2S、S2、SO2或其他用于ODHP的氧化剂。文档没有讨论丙烯产率、特定氧化剂的挑战或ODHP催化剂设计未来研究的领域。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene or the use of different sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 in this process. The document primarily discusses the dehydrogenation of isobutane over sulfided nickel catalysts, which is a different reaction. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in ODHP based on this text.
