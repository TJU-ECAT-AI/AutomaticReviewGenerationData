Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The text focuses on chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, which is a different process from ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献中没有关于硫基氧化剂或其与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯过程中的比较的信息。该文本主要讨论了含铬Beta沸石催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的丙烷脱氢过程，这与ODHP是不同的过程。因此，我无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The text primarily focuses on chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It does not discuss H2S, S2, SO2, or other sulfur-based oxidants in relation to ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of their effectiveness, impact on propylene yield, specific challenges, or key areas for future research based on this document.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document primarily focuses on chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for carbon dioxide assisted propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, or SO2, nor does it compare them with conventional oxidants in ODHP. The literature also does not cover the specific challenges associated with these oxidants, byproduct formation, or areas for future research in catalyst design for sulfur-based ODHP. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
