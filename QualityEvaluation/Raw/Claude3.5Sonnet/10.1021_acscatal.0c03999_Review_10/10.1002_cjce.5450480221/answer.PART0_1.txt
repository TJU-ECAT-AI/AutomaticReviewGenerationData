[1] "Oxygen, sulphur and selenium belong to Group VIA of the periodic table and exhibit similarities in their chemical properties. In general since the reactivity of elements in a given group decreases with increasing atomic weight, sulphur and selenium would be expected to act as milder oxidants than oxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."

[2] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-140O0F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (*), S,, in the high enough concentra tions necessary for efficient dehydrogenation"

[3] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (Iz), Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied ex tensively (I3) and it has been shown that species such as Sz, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s8 rings."

[4] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the HZS oxidation reaction to supply, insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halo gens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

The literature does not specifically discuss the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants. However, we can infer some general insights about sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur-based oxidants like H2S and S2 are expected to be milder oxidants compared to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This could potentially lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, but possibly at the cost of lower conversion rates.

2. Challenges:
- For S2: High temperatures (1200-1400°F) are required to obtain reactive S2 species in sufficient concentrations for efficient dehydrogenation. This could lead to unwanted thermal cracking reactions.
- For H2S: The oxidation of H2S produces various reactive sulfur species (S2, SH, S+) as intermediates, which could participate in the dehydrogenation reaction. However, controlling these intermediates and preventing the formation of elemental sulfur (S8 rings) may be challenging.

3. Potential advantages: Using H2S oxidation to generate reactive sulfur species in-situ could be a promising approach to replace halogens in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Areas for future research:
- Developing catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.
- Optimizing reaction conditions to maximize the formation and utilization of reactive sulfur species while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
- Investigating the specific effects of different sulfur species (H2S, S2, SO2) on propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP.
- Addressing potential issues with catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning.

Overall, while sulfur-based oxidants show potential as milder alternatives to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, significant research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with their use in ODHP and to optimize the process for improved propylene yields.

文献中并未具体讨论使用硫基氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的过程。但我们可以推断出一些关于硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的一般见解：

1. 有效性：与氧相比，H2S和S2等硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中预计是较温和的氧化剂。这可能会提高丙烯的选择性，但可能会以较低的转化率为代价。

2. 挑战：
- 对于S2：需要高温（1200-1400°F）才能获得足够浓度的活性S2物种进行高效脱氢。这可能导致不需要的热裂解反应。
- 对于H2S：H2S的氧化会产生各种活性硫物种（S2、SH、S+）作为中间体，这些中间体可能参与脱氢反应。然而，控制这些中间体并防止元素硫（S8环）的形成可能具有挑战性。

3. 潜在优势：利用H2S氧化原位生成活性硫物种可能是取代氧化脱氢反应中卤素的一种有前景的方法。

4. 未来研究领域：
- 开发能在较低温度下有效利用硫基氧化剂的催化剂，以避免热裂解。
- 优化反应条件，以最大化活性硫物种的形成和利用，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
- 研究不同硫物种（H2S、S2、SO2）对ODHP中丙烯产率和选择性的具体影响。
- 解决由于硫中毒可能导致的催化剂失活问题。

总的来说，虽然硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中显示出作为氧的温和替代品的潜力，但仍需要大量研究来克服与其在ODHP中使用相关的挑战，并优化该过程以提高丙烯产率。
