[1] "Theoretical considerations (thermodynamic and mechanistic) will be presented to show that it should be possible to use sulphur alone or together with chlorine and/or bromine in place of iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in the oxidative dehydrogenation of different hydrocarbons."

[2] "Figure 3 shows that thermodynamically HI can be oxidized to iodine more easily than HBr to Br2 to Cl2. In fact it can be seen that the oxidation of HCl becomes equilibrium limited at temperatures in excess of 1000°F indicating that larger quantities of HCl must be present in the reaction mixture (to produce a sufficiently high concentration of Cl2 for dehydrogenation) than either HBr or HI."

[3] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (*), S2, in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F)."

[4] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (12). Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied extensively (13) and it has been shown that species such as S2, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in S8 rings."

[5] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the H2S and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HCl and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with H2S while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some insights and discuss potential challenges and areas for future research:

1. Effectiveness: The document suggests that sulfur-based oxidants like H2S could potentially replace or complement conventional halogen-based oxidants (I2, Br2, Cl2) in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This implies that sulfur-based oxidants might offer comparable effectiveness in ODHP.

2. Propylene yield: While specific yields for propylene are not mentioned, the text indicates that using sulfur with or without halogens could potentially achieve high product yields in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Challenges:
   a) Temperature requirements: S2, a reactive sulfur species, requires high temperatures (1200-1400°F) to form in sufficient concentrations. This could lead to unwanted thermal cracking reactions.
   b) Catalyst design: Suitable catalysts need to be developed to promote rapid reactions between S2 and hydrocarbons while minimizing S2 polymerization to inactive S8.
   c) Regeneration: Efficient oxidation of H2S to regenerate active sulfur species is crucial for maintaining high yields.

4. Byproduct formation: The document doesn't specifically address byproduct formation for ODHP. However, it mentions the formation of various sulfur species (S2, SH, S+*) during H2S oxidation, which could potentially lead to undesired side reactions or products.

5. Future research areas:
   a) Catalyst development: Design catalysts that efficiently promote sulfur-based ODHP reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
   b) Optimizing reaction conditions: Determine optimal temperature ranges and reactant ratios for sulfur-based ODHP.
   c) Sulfur species control: Develop methods to maintain high concentrations of active sulfur species (e.g., S2) while minimizing formation of inactive forms (e.g., S8).
   d) Process integration: Investigate how to effectively incorporate H2S oxidation into the overall ODHP process.
   e) Economic feasibility: Assess the cost-effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional halogen-based systems.

In conclusion, while sulfur-based oxidants show promise for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, significant research is still needed to optimize their use specifically for ODHP and to overcome the associated challenges.

虽然文献没有直接比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断一些见解并讨论潜在的挑战和未来研究领域：

1. 有效性：文档表明，硫基氧化剂（如H2S）可能替代或补充传统的卤素基氧化剂（I2、Br2、Cl2）用于氧化脱氢反应。这意味着硫基氧化剂在ODHP中可能提供comparable的效果。

2. 丙烯产率：虽然没有提到具体的丙烯产率，但文本指出使用硫或硫与卤素的组合可能在氧化脱氢反应中达到高产品产率。

3. 挑战：
   a) 温度要求：反应性硫物种S2需要高温（1200-1400°F）才能形成足够的浓度。这可能导致不希望的热裂解反应。
   b) 催化剂设计：需要开发合适的催化剂，以促进S2与碳氢化合物之间的快速反应，同时最小化S2聚合成不活性S8。
   c) 再生：H2S的高效氧化以再生活性硫物种对于维持高产率至关重要。

4. 副产物形成：文档没有具体提到ODHP的副产物形成。但是，它提到了H2S氧化过程中形成各种硫物种（S2、SH、S+*），这可能导致不希望的副反应或产物。

5. 未来研究领域：
   a) 催化剂开发：设计能有效促进硫基ODHP反应同时最小化不希望的副反应的催化剂。
   b) 优化反应条件：确定硫基ODHP的最佳温度范围和反应物比例。
   c) 硫物种控制：开发维持高浓度活性硫物种（如S2）同时最小化不活性形式（如S8）形成的方法。
   d) 过程集成：研究如何有效地将H2S氧化整合到整体ODHP过程中。
   e) 经济可行性：评估硫基氧化剂相比传统卤素基系统的成本效益。

总之，虽然硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中显示出前景，但仍需要大量研究来优化它们特别用于ODHP的使用，并克服相关的挑战。
