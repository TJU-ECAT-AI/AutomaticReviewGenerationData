[1] "Theoretical considerations (thermodynamic and mechanistic) will be presented to show that it should be possible to use sulphur alone or together with chlorine and/or bromine in place of iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in the oxidative dehydrogenation of different hydrocarbons."

[2] "Figure 3 shows that thermodynamically HI can be oxidized to iodine more easily than HRr to Br2 to Clz. In fact it can be seen that the oxidation of HCI becomes equilibrium limited at temperatures in excess of i0Oo"F indicating that larger quantities of HCI must be present in the reaction mixture (to produce a sufficiently high concentration of Clz for dehydrogenation) than either HBr or HI."

[3] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-140O0F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (*), S,, in the high enough concentra- tions necessary for efficient dehydrogenation"

[4] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (Iz), Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied ex- tensively (I3) and it has been shown that species such as Sz, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s8 rings."

[5] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the HPS and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HC. and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with HPS while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

The literature does not specifically discuss the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants. However, based on the information provided about sulfur and halogen-based oxidants for general hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, we can infer some insights:

1. Effectiveness: The document suggests that sulfur could potentially be used alone or in combination with halogens for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. This implies that sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 could be effective for ODHP.

2. Yield: While specific propylene yields are not mentioned, the text indicates that using sulfur in place of or alongside halogens could still allow for high product yields.

3. Challenges:
   - H2S: May require careful control of oxidation to prevent formation of inactive S8 rings.
   - S2: Requires very high temperatures (1200-1400°F) to form reactive species, which could lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons.
   - SO2: Not specifically mentioned, but may face similar challenges as other sulfur species.

4. Byproduct formation: The document doesn't discuss specific byproducts for ODHP, but mentions the formation of water in halogen-based systems. Sulfur-based systems might form different byproducts.

5. Future research areas:
   - Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that promote rapid reaction between S2 and hydrocarbons while minimizing S8 formation.
   - Process optimization: Find ways to generate reactive sulfur species at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.
   - Mixed systems: Explore combinations of sulfur and halogen promoters to maximize yields and minimize costs.

6. Economic considerations: Sulfur is much cheaper than iodine or bromine, so replacing even small amounts of these halogens with sulfur could significantly reduce costs.

Overall, while sulfur-based oxidants show promise for oxidative dehydrogenation, more research is needed to overcome the challenges and optimize their use specifically for ODHP.

虽然文献没有具体讨论使用硫基氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的过程，但根据提供的关于硫和卤素基氧化剂用于一般烃类脱氢的信息，我们可以推断出一些见解：

1. 有效性：文件表明，硫可能单独使用或与卤素结合用于烃类的氧化脱氢。这意味着H2S、S2和SO2等硫基氧化剂可能对ODHP有效。

2. 产率：虽然没有提到具体的丙烯产率，但文本指出，使用硫代替或与卤素一起使用仍可能获得高产品产率。

3. 挑战：
   - H2S：可能需要仔细控制氧化过程，以防止形成无活性的S8环。
   - S2：需要很高的温度（1200-1400°F）才能形成反应性物种，这可能导致烃类热裂解。
   - SO2：虽然没有具体提及，但可能面临与其他硫化物类似的挑战。

4. 副产品形成：文件没有讨论ODHP的具体副产品，但提到在卤素基系统中会形成水。硫基系统可能会形成不同的副产品。

5. 未来研究方向：
   - 催化剂设计：开发能促进S2与烃类快速反应同时最小化S8形成的催化剂。
   - 工艺优化：寻找在较低温度下生成反应性硫化物的方法，以避免热裂解。
   - 混合系统：探索硫和卤素促进剂的组合，以最大化产率并最小化成本。

6. 经济考虑：硫比碘或溴便宜得多，所以用硫替代这些卤素中的少量也可能显著降低成本。

总的来说，虽然硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢方面显示出潜力，但还需要更多研究来克服挑战并优化它们在ODHP中的具体应用。

The literature does not specifically discuss the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants. However, we can infer some general insights about sulfur-based oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur-based oxidants like H2S and S2 are expected to be milder oxidants compared to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This could potentially lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, but possibly at the cost of lower conversion rates.

2. Challenges:
- For S2: High temperatures (1200-1400°F) are required to obtain reactive S2 species in sufficient concentrations for efficient dehydrogenation. This could lead to unwanted thermal cracking reactions.
- For H2S: The oxidation of H2S produces various reactive sulfur species (S2, SH, S+) as intermediates, which could participate in the dehydrogenation reaction. However, controlling these intermediates and preventing the formation of elemental sulfur (S8 rings) may be challenging.

3. Potential advantages: Using H2S oxidation to generate reactive sulfur species in-situ could be a promising approach to replace halogens in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Areas for future research:
- Developing catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.
- Optimizing reaction conditions to maximize the formation and utilization of reactive sulfur species while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
- Investigating the specific effects of different sulfur species (H2S, S2, SO2) on propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP.
- Addressing potential issues with catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning.

Overall, while sulfur-based oxidants show potential as milder alternatives to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, significant research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with their use in ODHP and to optimize the process for improved propylene yields.

文献中并未具体讨论使用硫基氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的过程。但我们可以推断出一些关于硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的一般见解：

1. 有效性：与氧相比，H2S和S2等硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中预计是较温和的氧化剂。这可能会提高丙烯的选择性，但可能会以较低的转化率为代价。

2. 挑战：
- 对于S2：需要高温（1200-1400°F）才能获得足够浓度的活性S2物种进行高效脱氢。这可能导致不需要的热裂解反应。
- 对于H2S：H2S的氧化会产生各种活性硫物种（S2、SH、S+）作为中间体，这些中间体可能参与脱氢反应。然而，控制这些中间体并防止元素硫（S8环）的形成可能具有挑战性。

3. 潜在优势：利用H2S氧化原位生成活性硫物种可能是取代氧化脱氢反应中卤素的一种有前景的方法。

4. 未来研究领域：
- 开发能在较低温度下有效利用硫基氧化剂的催化剂，以避免热裂解。
- 优化反应条件，以最大化活性硫物种的形成和利用，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
- 研究不同硫物种（H2S、S2、SO2）对ODHP中丙烯产率和选择性的具体影响。
- 解决由于硫中毒可能导致的催化剂失活问题。

总的来说，虽然硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中显示出作为氧的温和替代品的潜力，但仍需要大量研究来克服与其在ODHP中使用相关的挑战，并优化该过程以提高丙烯产率。

The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does discuss the potential use of sulfur and sulfur compounds as alternatives to halogen promoters in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in general.

The document suggests that sulfur could potentially replace iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It mentions that H2S oxidation can produce reactive sulfur species like S2, SH, and S+*, which could potentially serve as promoters in dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature indicates that H2S could potentially replace HI in promoter mixtures while still allowing high product yields. This suggests that H2S might be effective in ODHP, although specific data on propylene yield is not provided.

Challenges associated with using sulfur-based oxidants are not explicitly discussed for ODHP. However, the document mentions the need for suitable catalysts to ensure rapid reaction between S2 and hydrocarbons while minimizing polymerization of S2 to inactive S8 form.

Key areas for future research, as implied by the document, include:
1. Developing catalysts that efficiently promote both sulfur-based and halogen-based reactions.
2. Optimizing the use of H2S as a promoter in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Investigating the effectiveness of mixed halogen/sulfur promoted systems.
4. Studying the economic implications of replacing expensive halogen promoters with cheaper sulfur-based alternatives.

It's important to note that this document does not provide specific information on ODHP or compare different sulfur-based oxidants directly. Further research would be needed to determine the exact impact of various sulfur-based oxidants on propylene yield in ODHP and to address the specific challenges associated with each oxidant.
