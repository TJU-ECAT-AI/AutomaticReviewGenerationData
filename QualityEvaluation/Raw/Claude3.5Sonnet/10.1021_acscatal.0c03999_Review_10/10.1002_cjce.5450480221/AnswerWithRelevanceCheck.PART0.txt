          [1] "Theoretical considerations (thermodynamic and mechanistic) will be presented to show that it should be possible to use sulphur alone or together with chlorine and/or bromine in place of iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in the oxidative dehydrogenation of different hydrocarbons."

[2] "Oxygen, sulphur and selenium belong to Group VIA of the periodic table and exhibit similarities in their chemical properties. In general since the reactivity of elements in a given group decreases with increasing atomic weight, sulphur and selenium would be expected to act as milder oxidants than oxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."

[3] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-140O0F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (*), S,, in the high enough concentra- tions necessary for efficient dehydrogenation"

[4] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (Iz), Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied ex- tensively (I3) and it has been shown that species such as Sz, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s8 rings."

[5] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the HPS and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HC. and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with HPS while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

          The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, based on the provided information, we can infer some insights:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) are expected to be milder oxidants compared to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This could potentially lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, but possibly at the cost of lower conversion rates.

2. Propylene yield: While specific propylene yields are not mentioned, the text indicates that using sulfur in place of or alongside halogens could still allow for high product yields in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Challenges:
   - High temperature requirements: S2 requires very high temperatures (1200-1400°F) to form reactive species, which could lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons.
   - H2S oxidation control: Careful control is needed to generate reactive sulfur species (S2, SH, S+*) while preventing the formation of inactive S8 rings.
   - Catalyst design: Development of catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.

4. Byproduct formation: The document doesn't discuss specific byproducts for ODHP, but mentions the formation of various sulfur species during H2S oxidation, which could potentially lead to undesired side reactions or products.

5. Future research areas:
   - Catalyst development: Design catalysts that promote rapid reactions between sulfur species and hydrocarbons while minimizing S8 formation.
   - Process optimization: Find ways to generate reactive sulfur species at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.
   - Mixed systems: Explore combinations of sulfur and halogen promoters to maximize yields and minimize costs.
   - Reaction mechanisms: Investigate the specific effects of different sulfur species (H2S, S2, SO2) on propylene yield and selectivity in ODHP.
   - Economic feasibility: Assess the cost-effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional systems.

Overall, while sulfur-based oxidants show potential as milder alternatives to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, significant research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with their use in ODHP and to optimize the process for improved propylene yields.

          文献并未直接比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些见解：

1. 有效性：与氧相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）在氧化脱氢反应中预计是较温和的氧化剂。这可能会提高丙烯的选择性，但可能会以较低的转化率为代价。

2. 丙烯产率：虽然没有提到具体的丙烯产率，但文本指出，在氧化脱氢反应中使用硫代替或与卤素一起使用仍可能获得高产品产率。

3. 挑战：
   - 高温要求：S2需要很高的温度（1200-1400°F）才能形成活性物种，这可能导致碳氢化合物的热裂解。
   - H2S氧化控制：需要仔细控制以生成活性硫物种（S2、SH、S+*），同时防止形成无活性的S8环。
   - 催化剂设计：开发能在较低温度下有效利用硫基氧化剂的催化剂，以避免热裂解。

4. 副产品形成：文件没有讨论ODHP的具体副产品，但提到在H2S氧化过程中会形成各种硫物种，这可能导致不需要的副反应或产物。

5. 未来研究领域：
   - 催化剂开发：设计能促进硫物种与碳氢化合物快速反应同时最小化S8形成的催化剂。
   - 工艺优化：寻找在较低温度下生成活性硫物种的方法，以避免热裂解。
   - 混合系统：探索硫和卤素促进剂的组合，以最大化产率并最小化成本。
   - 反应机理：研究不同硫物种（H2S、S2、SO2）对ODHP中丙烯产率和选择性的具体影响。
   - 经济可行性：评估硫基氧化剂相比传统系统的成本效益。

总的来说，虽然硫基氧化剂在氧化脱氢反应中显示出作为氧的温和替代品的潜力，但仍需要大量研究来克服与其在ODHP中使用相关的挑战，并优化该过程以提高丙烯产率。
