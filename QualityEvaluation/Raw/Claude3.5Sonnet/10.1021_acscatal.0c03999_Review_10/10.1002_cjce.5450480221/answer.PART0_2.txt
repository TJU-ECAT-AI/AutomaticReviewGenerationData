[1] "Theoretical considerations (thermodynamic and mechanistic) will be presented to show that it should be possible to use sulphur alone or together with chlorine and/or bromine in place of iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in the oxidative dehydrogenation of different hydrocarbons."

[2] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (Iz), Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied extensively (I3) and it has been shown that species such as Sz, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s8 rings."

[3] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the HZS oxidation reaction to supply, insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halogens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the HPS and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HC. and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with HPS while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does discuss the potential use of sulfur and sulfur compounds as alternatives to halogen promoters in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in general.

The document suggests that sulfur could potentially replace iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It mentions that H2S oxidation can produce reactive sulfur species like S2, SH, and S+*, which could potentially serve as promoters in dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature indicates that H2S could potentially replace HI in promoter mixtures while still allowing high product yields. This suggests that H2S might be effective in ODHP, although specific data on propylene yield is not provided.

Challenges associated with using sulfur-based oxidants are not explicitly discussed for ODHP. However, the document mentions the need for suitable catalysts to ensure rapid reaction between S2 and hydrocarbons while minimizing polymerization of S2 to inactive S8 form.

Key areas for future research, as implied by the document, include:
1. Developing catalysts that efficiently promote both sulfur-based and halogen-based reactions.
2. Optimizing the use of H2S as a promoter in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Investigating the effectiveness of mixed halogen/sulfur promoted systems.
4. Studying the economic implications of replacing expensive halogen promoters with cheaper sulfur-based alternatives.

It's important to note that this document does not provide specific information on ODHP or compare different sulfur-based oxidants directly. Further research would be needed to determine the exact impact of various sulfur-based oxidants on propylene yield in ODHP and to address the specific challenges associated with each oxidant.

文献并未直接比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。但是，它确实讨论了在氧化脱氢反应中使用硫和硫化物作为卤素促进剂替代品的潜力。

文档提出，硫可能替代碘或碘/卤素混合物在氧化脱氢反应中的作用。它提到H2S氧化可以产生活性硫物种，如S2、SH和S+*，这些物种可能作为脱氢反应的促进剂。

文献指出，H2S可能替代促进剂混合物中的HI，同时仍能获得高产品产率。这表明H2S可能在ODHP中有效，尽管没有提供具体的丙烯产率数据。

文献并未明确讨论使用硫基氧化剂的挑战，特别是对于ODHP。然而，文档提到需要合适的催化剂以确保S2与碳氢化合物之间的快速反应，同时最小化S2聚合成不活性S8形式。

文档暗示的未来研究关键领域包括：
1. 开发能有效促进硫基和卤素基反应的催化剂。
2. 优化H2S在氧化脱氢反应中作为促进剂的使用。
3. 研究混合卤素/硫促进系统的有效性。
4. 研究用更便宜的硫基替代品替代昂贵的卤素促进剂的经济影响。

需要注意的是，本文档并未提供ODHP的具体信息或直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂。需要进一步研究以确定各种硫基氧化剂对ODHP中丙烯产率的确切影响，并解决与每种氧化剂相关的具体挑战。
