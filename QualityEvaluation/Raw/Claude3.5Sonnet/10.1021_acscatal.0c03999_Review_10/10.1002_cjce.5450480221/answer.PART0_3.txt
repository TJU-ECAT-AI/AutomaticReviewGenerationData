[1] "Oxygen, sulphur and selenium belong to Group VIA of the periodic table and exhibit similarities in their chemical properties. In general since the reactivity of elements in a given group decreases with increasing atomic weight, sulphur and selenium would be expected to act as milder oxidants than oxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."

[2] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known [...] and it has been shown that species such as S2, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s8 rings."

[3] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the H2S oxidation reaction to supply, insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halogens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "Here it should be noted that the previous data indicating the high promoter efficiency of mixed halogens in an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction should in theory be directly applicable to a mixed halogen/sulphur promoted system."

The literature does not provide specific information about the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants. However, we can extrapolate some insights based on the general information provided about sulfur in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur-based oxidants like H2S and S2 are expected to be milder oxidants compared to conventional oxygen. This could potentially lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, as milder oxidants may reduce over-oxidation and combustion reactions.

2. Propylene yield: While specific yields are not mentioned, the use of sulfur species in combination with halogens is suggested to potentially achieve high product yields, which could be applicable to propylene production from propane.

3. Challenges:
   - H2S utilization requires careful control to generate reactive sulfur species (S2, SH, S+*) in situ.
   - Preventing the polymerization of S2 to inactive S8 form is crucial.
   - Catalyst design needs to balance the promotion of sulfur-hydrocarbon reactions while minimizing undesired side reactions.

4. Future research areas:
   - Developing catalysts that efficiently promote sulfur-hydrocarbon reactions while inhibiting S8 formation.
   - Optimizing mixed halogen/sulfur promoted systems for ODHP.
   - Investigating the specific reaction mechanisms and kinetics of sulfur species in ODHP.
   - Addressing potential issues with sulfur-containing byproducts and their separation.

5. Process optimization:
   - Exploring the use of H2S oxidation to generate reactive sulfur species in situ.
   - Investigating the synergistic effects of sulfur species with halogens in mixed promoter systems.
   - Determining optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratios) for sulfur-based ODHP.

It's important to note that while the document provides general insights on sulfur in oxidative dehydrogenation, specific research on ODHP using sulfur-based oxidants would be necessary to fully address the question and determine the actual impact on propylene production.

虽然文献中没有提供关于使用硫基氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的具体信息，但我们可以根据所提供的关于硫在氧化脱氢反应中的一般信息进行一些推断：

1. 有效性：与传统的氧气相比，H2S和S2等硫基氧化剂预计是较温和的氧化剂。这可能会提高对丙烯的选择性，因为较温和的氧化剂可能会减少过度氧化和燃烧反应。

2. 丙烯产率：虽然没有提到具体的产率，但文献建议将硫物种与卤素结合使用可能会获得高产品产率，这可能适用于从丙烷生产丙烯。

3. 挑战：
   - H2S的利用需要仔细控制，以原位生成活性硫物种（S2, SH, S+*）。
   - 防止S2聚合成不活性的S8形式至关重要。
   - 催化剂设计需要平衡促进硫-碳氢化合物反应和最小化不良副反应。

4. 未来研究领域：
   - 开发能有效促进硫-碳氢化合物反应同时抑制S8形成的催化剂。
   - 优化ODHP的混合卤素/硫促进系统。
   - 研究硫物种在ODHP中的具体反应机理和动力学。
   - 解决含硫副产品及其分离的潜在问题。

5. 工艺优化：
   - 探索利用H2S氧化原位生成活性硫物种。
   - 研究混合促进剂系统中硫物种与卤素的协同作用。
   - 确定硫基ODHP的最佳反应条件（温度、压力、反应物比例）。

需要注意的是，虽然文件提供了关于硫在氧化脱氢中的一般见解，但需要对使用硫基氧化剂进行ODHP的具体研究，才能全面回答这个问题并确定其对丙烯生产的实际影响。
