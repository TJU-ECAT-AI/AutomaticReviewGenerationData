          [1] "It is known [1, 2] that, in the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide on carbon, the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S is observed."

[2] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide at 600-700°C over the catalysts under study occurs via a complicated heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism. This reaction is accompanied by the formation of a series of products: C3H8 transforms into C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, CO2, and coke; SO2 transforms into H2S, H2O, and S."

[3] "The catalytic properties of samples in propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of sulfur dioxide were studied in a flow setup at an atmospheric pressure at 600-700°C and a contact time of τ = 10 s."

[4] "A reaction mixture containing l0 vol % C3H8, 10, l0 vol % SO2, and 80 vol % He passed through a catalyst bed"

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The study focuses primarily on SO2 as an oxidant. Based on the limited information provided, we can draw some insights:

1. SO2 as an oxidant:
- SO2 is effective in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at temperatures between 600-700°C.
- The reaction occurs via a complex heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism.
- SO2 transforms into H2S, H2O, and S during the reaction.

2. Byproduct formation:
- The process produces various byproducts including ethane, ethylene, methane, CO, CO2, and coke.
- Oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S are also formed.

3. Reaction conditions:
- The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 600-700°C.
- A reaction mixture containing 10 vol% C3H8, 10 vol% SO2, and 80 vol% He is used.

4. Challenges:
- The formation of multiple byproducts suggests that selectivity towards propylene is a key challenge.
- Coke formation may lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

The literature does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, nor does it directly compare SO2 with conventional oxidants. More research would be needed to fully address the question and provide a comprehensive comparison of different oxidants in ODHP, including:
1. Comparative studies of H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants in ODHP
2. Propylene yields for different oxidants
3. Specific challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant
4. Key areas for improving catalyst design for sulfur-based ODHP

          该文献并未对不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果进行全面比较。该研究主要集中在SO2作为氧化剂上。根据提供的有限信息，我们可以得出一些见解：

1. SO2作为氧化剂：
- SO2在600-700°C的温度范围内可有效地进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。
- 反应通过复杂的异相-均相机理进行。
- SO2在反应过程中转化为H2S、H2O和S。

2. 副产物形成：
- 该过程产生各种副产物，包括乙烷、乙烯、甲烷、CO、CO2和焦炭。
- 还形成了含C、H、O和S的氧化缩合产物（OCP）。

3. 反应条件：
- 反应通常在600-700°C的温度下进行。
- 使用含10体积%C3H8、10体积%SO2和80体积%He的反应混合物。

4. 挑战：
- 多种副产物的形成表明，提高对丙烯的选择性是一个关键挑战。
- 焦炭的形成可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

该文献没有提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的信息，也没有直接将SO2与传统氧化剂进行比较。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答这个问题，并对ODHP中不同氧化剂进行全面比较，包括：
1. H2S、S2和SO2与ODHP中传统氧化剂的比较研究
2. 不同氧化剂的丙烯产率
3. 与每种硫基氧化剂相关的具体挑战
4. 改进硫基ODHP催化剂设计的关键领域
