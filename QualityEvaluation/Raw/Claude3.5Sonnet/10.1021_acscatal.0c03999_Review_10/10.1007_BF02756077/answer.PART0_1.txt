[1] "It is known [1, 2] that, in the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide on carbon, the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S is observed."

[2] "A reaction mixture containing l0 vol % C3H8, 10, l0 vol % SO2, and 80 vol % He passed through a catalyst bed"

[3] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide at 600-700 over the catalysts under study occurs via a complicated heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism. This reaction is accompanied by the formation of a series of products: C3H8 transforms into C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, CO2, and coke; SO2 transforms into H2S, H20, and S."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it does provide some information about using SO2 as an oxidant:

1. SO2 can be used as an oxidant for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, producing propylene along with other products.

2. The reaction using SO2 occurs via a complex heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism.

3. When using SO2, byproducts include ethane, ethylene, methane, CO, CO2, coke, H2S, H2O, and elemental sulfur.

4. Oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S are formed during the reaction.

5. The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 600-700°C.

The document does not provide information on propylene yield compared to conventional oxidants, nor does it discuss H2S or S2 as oxidants. It also doesn't mention specific challenges associated with using SO2 or areas for future research to improve catalyst design.

To fully answer the question, more research would be needed on:
1. Comparative studies of H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants in ODHP
2. Propylene yields for different oxidants
3. Specific challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant
4. Key areas for improving catalyst design for sulfur-based ODHP

该文献并未提供不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用SO2作为氧化剂的信息：

1. SO2可以用作丙烷氧化脱氢的氧化剂，产生丙烯和其他产物。

2. 使用SO2的反应通过复杂的异相-均相机制进行。

3. 使用SO2时，副产品包括乙烷、乙烯、甲烷、CO、CO2、焦炭、H2S、H2O和元素硫。

4. 反应过程中会形成含有C、H、O和S的氧化缩合产物（OCP）。

5. 反应通常在600-700°C的温度下进行。

该文档没有提供与传统氧化剂相比的丙烯产率信息，也没有讨论H2S或S2作为氧化剂的情况。它也没有提到使用SO2的具体挑战或改进催化剂设计的未来研究领域。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要进行更多研究：
1. H2S、S2和SO2与ODHP中传统氧化剂的比较研究
2. 不同氧化剂的丙烯产率
3. 与每种硫基氧化剂相关的具体挑战
4. 改进硫基ODHP催化剂设计的关键领域
