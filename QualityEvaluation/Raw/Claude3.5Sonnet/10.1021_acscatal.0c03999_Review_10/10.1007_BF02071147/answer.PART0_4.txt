[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

[3] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[4] "It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) and conventional oxidants.

SO2 is shown to be effective as an oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane. The use of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts with SO2 is mentioned to yield high amounts of propylene.

The study indicates that increasing the amount of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst leads to higher propylene yields. This suggests that sulfur plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.

The literature also mentions that both sulfurized catalysts and elemental sulfur can selectively enhance hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, indicating potential for these sulfur-based systems in ODHP.

However, the document does not provide specific information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, nor does it compare these sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants. It also lacks detailed information on byproduct formation or specific challenges associated with each oxidant.

For future research, the study suggests focusing on:
1. Understanding the role of sulfur in catalytic activity
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration in catalysts
3. Investigating the mechanism of sulfur incorporation into oxidative condensation products (OCP)
4. Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants and catalysts for ODHP

To improve catalyst design and optimize the process, research should aim to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which sulfur enhances catalytic activity and selectivity in ODHP reactions.

该文献主要关注SO2作为氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的研究，并简要提及了元素硫。文献并未提供不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与传统氧化剂之间的全面比较。

研究表明SO2是一种有效的碳氢化合物脱氢氧化剂，包括丙烷在内。文献提到使用活性炭负载的氧化铁作为催化剂，配合SO2可以获得高产率的丙烯。

研究指出，增加催化剂上预吸附的硫量会导致丙烯产率提高。这表明硫在增强丙烷脱氢催化活性中起着关键作用。

文献还提到，硫化催化剂和元素硫都可以选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢，表明这些含硫体系在ODHP中具有潜力。

然而，文献并未提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的具体信息，也没有将这些硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂进行比较。它还缺乏关于副产物形成或与每种氧化剂相关的具体挑战的详细信息。

对于未来的研究，该研究建议关注：
1. 理解硫在催化活性中的作用
2. 优化催化剂中的硫浓度
3. 研究硫incorpor入氧化缩合产物（OCP）的机理
4. 探索其他硫基氧化剂和催化剂在ODHP中的潜力

为了改进催化剂设计和优化工艺，研究应致力于阐明硫增强ODHP反应中催化活性和选择性的确切机理。
