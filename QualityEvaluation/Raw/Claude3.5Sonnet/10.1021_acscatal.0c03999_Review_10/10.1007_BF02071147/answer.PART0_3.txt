[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

[3] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[4] "To establish the sulfur contribution to the reaction under study, we have carried out the following experiments. An R pulse was admitted to the initial catalyst and the amount of evolved propylene was analyzed. Then certain amounts of S, RSO or SO were passed through the catalyst and again an R pulse was admitted and the amount of propylene was analyzed, and so on."

[5] "It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2 with conventional oxidants.

For SO2:
- It can be used as an oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.
- When used with iron oxides supported on activated carbon catalysts, it allows for high propylene yields.
- The formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface during the reaction appears to enhance catalytic activity.

For elemental sulfur:
- It can selectively enhance hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.
- Increasing amounts of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst led to higher propylene yields.

The study suggests that sulfur concentration in the catalyst significantly affects its catalytic properties. However, it does not provide specific information on byproduct formation or compare the challenges associated with different oxidants.

Key areas for future research based on this study could include:
1. Investigating the role of sulfur in enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration in catalysts for maximum propylene yield.
3. Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., H2S, S2) in propane dehydrogenation.
4. Studying the formation and properties of oxidative condensation products to better understand their role in catalysis.

The study does not provide enough information to make a comprehensive comparison between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in terms of propylene yield, specific challenges, or overall process optimization.

这篇文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，并略微提及了元素硫。它没有提供不同硫基氧化剂（如H2S或S2）与传统氧化剂的全面比较。

关于SO2：
- 它可以用作碳氢化合物脱氢的氧化剂。
- 当与活性炭负载的氧化铁催化剂一起使用时，可以获得高丙烯产率。
- 反应过程中在催化剂表面形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）似乎能增强催化活性。

关于元素硫：
- 它可以选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢。
- 催化剂上预吸附的硫量增加导致丙烯产率提高。

研究表明，催化剂中的硫浓度显著影响其催化性能。然而，它没有提供关于副产物形成的具体信息，也没有比较不同氧化剂相关的挑战。

基于这项研究，未来研究的关键领域可能包括：
1. 研究硫在增强催化活性和选择性方面的作用。
2. 优化催化剂中的硫浓度以获得最大丙烯产率。
3. 探索其他硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2）在丙烷脱氢中的潜力。
4. 研究氧化缩合产物的形成和性质，以更好地理解它们在催化过程中的作用。

这项研究没有提供足够的信息来全面比较硫基氧化剂和传统氧化剂在丙烯产率、具体挑战或整体过程优化方面的差异。
