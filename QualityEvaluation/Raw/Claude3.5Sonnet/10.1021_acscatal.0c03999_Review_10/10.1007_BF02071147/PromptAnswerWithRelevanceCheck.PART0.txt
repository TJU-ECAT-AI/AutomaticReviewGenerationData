[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2J."

[3] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 and elemental sulfur [3,113 can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It does not provide comprehensive information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP. However, based on the available information, we can discuss the effectiveness of SO2 and elemental sulfur:

1. SO2 as an oxidant:
- SO2 is effective for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including propane.
- When used with iron oxides supported on activated carbon catalysts, SO2 can produce high yields of propylene from propane.
- The formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) during the reaction appears to enhance catalyst activity over time.

2. Elemental sulfur:
- Elemental sulfur can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.
- Increasing amounts of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst lead to higher propylene yields.

Challenges associated with SO2:
- Formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface, which affects the catalyst's surface area and carbon balance.
- The need to optimize the sulfur concentration in OCPs to maximize catalytic activity.

Key areas for future research:
- Understanding the role of sulfur in the catalyst structure and its impact on propane activation.
- Optimizing the sulfur concentration in catalysts to enhance propylene yield.
- Investigating the long-term stability of sulfur-based catalysts and their resistance to deactivation.
- Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., H2S, S2) for ODHP and comparing their effectiveness to SO2.
- Developing catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing unwanted side reactions and byproduct formation.

The literature does not provide specific information on byproduct formation or a direct comparison with conventional oxidants. Further research is needed to fully compare the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in ODHP.

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It doesn't directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

SO2 is shown to be effective as an oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane. When used with iron oxides supported on activated carbon, it can produce high propylene yields. The study also suggests that increasing the amount of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst leads to higher propylene yields.

Elemental sulfur is mentioned as capable of selectively enhancing hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, similar to sulfurized catalysts. However, the specific challenges, byproduct formation, and detailed comparisons with conventional oxidants are not discussed in the given literature.

Key areas for future research, based on this study, might include:
1. Investigating the role of sulfur in the oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed during the reaction.
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration in catalysts to maximize propylene yield.
3. Comparing the effectiveness and selectivity of different sulfur-based oxidants (SO2, elemental sulfur, and potentially H2S and S2) in ODHP.
4. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration of sulfur-containing catalysts.
5. Exploring the mechanism of sulfur incorporation into the catalyst structure and its impact on catalytic activity.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to compare these sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants and to address the specific challenges associated with each.
