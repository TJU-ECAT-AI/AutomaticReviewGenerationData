[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2J."

[3] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 and elemental sulfur [3,113 can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[4] "It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It does not provide comprehensive information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP. However, based on the available information, we can discuss the effectiveness of SO2 and elemental sulfur:

1. SO2 as an oxidant:
- SO2 is effective for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including propane.
- When used with iron oxides supported on activated carbon catalysts, SO2 can produce high yields of propylene from propane.
- The formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) during the reaction appears to enhance catalyst activity over time.

2. Elemental sulfur:
- Elemental sulfur can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.
- Increasing amounts of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst lead to higher propylene yields.

Challenges associated with SO2:
- Formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface, which affects the catalyst's surface area and carbon balance.
- The need to optimize the sulfur concentration in OCPs to maximize catalytic activity.

Key areas for future research:
- Understanding the role of sulfur in the catalyst structure and its impact on propane activation.
- Optimizing the sulfur concentration in catalysts to enhance propylene yield.
- Investigating the long-term stability of sulfur-based catalysts and their resistance to deactivation.
- Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., H2S, S2) for ODHP and comparing their effectiveness to SO2.
- Developing catalysts that can effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing unwanted side reactions and byproduct formation.

The literature does not provide specific information on byproduct formation or a direct comparison with conventional oxidants. Further research is needed to fully compare the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in ODHP.

该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的氧化剂，并略微提及了元素硫。文献并未提供关于H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的全面信息。但根据可用信息，我们可以讨论SO2和元素硫的有效性：

1. SO2作为氧化剂：
- SO2可有效用于碳氢化合物的脱氢，包括丙烷。
- 当与活性炭负载的氧化铁催化剂一起使用时，SO2可以从丙烷中产生高产率的丙烯。
- 反应过程中形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）似乎随时间推移提高了催化剂活性。

2. 元素硫：
- 元素硫可以选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢。
- 催化剂上预吸附硫的量增加会导致更高的丙烯产率。

与SO2相关的挑战：
- 在催化剂表面形成氧化缩合产物（OCP），影响催化剂的表面积和碳平衡。
- 需要优化OCP中的硫浓度以最大化催化活性。

未来研究的关键领域：
- 了解硫在催化剂结构中的作用及其对丙烷活化的影响。
- 优化催化剂中的硫浓度以提高丙烯产率。
- 研究基于硫的催化剂的长期稳定性及其抗失活能力。
- 探索其他基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2）用于ODHP的潜力，并与SO2的效果进行比较。
- 开发能有效利用基于硫的氧化剂的催化剂，同时最小化不需要的副反应和副产物形成。

文献没有提供关于副产物形成或与传统氧化剂直接比较的具体信息。需要进一步研究以全面比较不同基于硫的氧化剂与传统氧化剂在ODHP中的有效性。
