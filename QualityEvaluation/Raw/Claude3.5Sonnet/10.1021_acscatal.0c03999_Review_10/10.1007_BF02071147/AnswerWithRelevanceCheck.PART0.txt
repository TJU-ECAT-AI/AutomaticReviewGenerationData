          "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

"As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2J]."

"Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 and elemental sulfur [3,113 can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

"It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

"The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

          The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It does not provide comprehensive information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP, nor does it offer a direct comparison with conventional oxidants.

Key findings on SO2 and elemental sulfur:
1. SO2 is effective for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane.
2. High propylene yields can be achieved using iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts with SO2.
3. Elemental sulfur can selectively enhance hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.
4. Increasing amounts of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst lead to higher propylene yields.
5. Sulfur concentration significantly affects the catalytic properties of oxidative condensation products (OCP).

Challenges associated with SO2:
- Formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface, affecting surface area and carbon balance.
- Need to optimize sulfur concentration in OCPs to maximize catalytic activity.

Key areas for future research:
1. Understanding the role of sulfur in catalyst structure and its impact on propane activation.
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration in catalysts to enhance propylene yield.
3. Investigating long-term stability and regeneration of sulfur-containing catalysts.
4. Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) for ODHP.
5. Developing catalysts that effectively utilize sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing unwanted side reactions and byproduct formation.
6. Comparing the performance of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants.
7. Addressing potential environmental concerns related to sulfur-based oxidants.

The literature does not provide specific information on byproduct formation or a direct comparison with conventional oxidants, which are important areas for further research to fully assess the advantages and disadvantages of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP.

          该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的氧化剂，并略微提及了元素硫。文献并未提供关于H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的全面信息，也没有与传统氧化剂进行直接比较。

关于SO2和元素硫的主要发现：
1. SO2可有效用于碳氢化合物的脱氢，包括丙烷。
2. 使用活性炭负载的氧化铁作为催化剂，配合SO2可以获得高产率的丙烯。
3. 元素硫可以选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢。
4. 增加催化剂上预吸附的硫量会导致更高的丙烯产率。
5. 硫浓度显著影响氧化缩合产物（OCP）的催化性能。

与SO2相关的挑战：
- 在催化剂表面形成氧化缩合产物（OCP），影响表面积和碳平衡。
- 需要优化OCP中的硫浓度以最大化催化活性。

未来研究的关键领域：
1. 了解硫在催化剂结构中的作用及其对丙烷活化的影响。
2. 优化催化剂中的硫浓度以提高丙烯产率。
3. 研究含硫催化剂的长期稳定性和再生。
4. 探索其他基于硫的氧化剂（如H2S、S2）用于ODHP的潜力。
5. 开发能有效利用基于硫的氧化剂的催化剂，同时最小化不需要的副反应和副产物形成。
6. 比较不同硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂的性能。
7. 解决与硫基氧化剂相关的潜在环境问题。

文献没有提供关于副产物形成或与传统氧化剂直接比较的具体信息，这些是进一步研究的重要领域，以全面评估硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的优缺点。
