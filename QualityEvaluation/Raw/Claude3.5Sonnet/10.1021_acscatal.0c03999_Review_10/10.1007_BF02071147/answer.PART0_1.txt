[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2J]."

[3] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 and elemental sulfur [3,113 can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[4] "It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

[5] "The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) and conventional oxidants.

For SO2:
- It can be effectively used as an oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane.
- High yields of propylene can be obtained when using iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts.
- The formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the catalyst surface appears to enhance catalytic activity over time.

For elemental sulfur:
- It can selectively enhance hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.
- Increasing the amount of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst leads to higher propylene yields.

The study suggests that sulfur concentration significantly affects the catalytic properties of OCP, indicating that the presence of sulfur in the catalyst or oxidant plays a crucial role in improving propylene yield.

Key challenges and areas for future research:
1. Understanding the exact mechanism of sulfur's role in enhancing catalytic activity.
2. Optimizing the sulfur concentration in catalysts or oxidants to maximize propylene yield.
3. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of sulfur-containing catalysts.
4. Comparing the performance of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) with SO2 and conventional oxidants.
5. Addressing potential environmental concerns related to sulfur-based oxidants and developing mitigation strategies.

The literature does not provide specific information on byproduct formation or a direct comparison with conventional oxidants, which could be important areas for further research to fully assess the advantages and disadvantages of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP.

该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的氧化剂，并略微提及了元素硫。它没有提供不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与传统氧化剂之间的全面比较。

关于SO2：
- 它可以有效地用作碳氢化合物脱氢的氧化剂，包括丙烷。
- 使用负载在活性炭上的氧化铁作为催化剂时，可以获得高产率的丙烯。
- 催化剂表面上形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）似乎随时间推移而增强催化活性。

关于元素硫：
- 它可以选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢。
- 增加催化剂上预吸附的硫量会导致更高的丙烯产率。

研究表明，硫浓度显著影响OCP的催化性能，这表明催化剂或氧化剂中硫的存在对提高丙烯产率起着关键作用。

主要挑战和未来研究领域：
1. 了解硫在增强催化活性中的确切机理。
2. 优化催化剂或氧化剂中的硫浓度，以最大化丙烯产率。
3. 研究含硫催化剂的长期稳定性和再生。
4. 比较不同硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2）与SO2和传统氧化剂的性能。
5. 解决与硫基氧化剂相关的潜在环境问题，并制定缓解策略。

文献未提供有关副产物形成或与传统氧化剂直接比较的具体信息，这可能是进一步研究的重要领域，以全面评估硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的优缺点。
