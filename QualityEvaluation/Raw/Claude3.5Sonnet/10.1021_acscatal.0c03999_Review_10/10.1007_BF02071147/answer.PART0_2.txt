[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

[3] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[4] "It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, with some mention of elemental sulfur. It doesn't directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

SO2 is shown to be effective as an oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane. When used with iron oxides supported on activated carbon, it can produce high propylene yields. The study also suggests that increasing the amount of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst leads to higher propylene yields.

Elemental sulfur is mentioned as capable of selectively enhancing hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, similar to sulfurized catalysts. However, the specific challenges, byproduct formation, and detailed comparisons with conventional oxidants are not discussed in the given literature.

Key areas for future research, based on this study, might include:
1. Investigating the role of sulfur in the oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed during the reaction.
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration in catalysts to maximize propylene yield.
3. Comparing the effectiveness and selectivity of different sulfur-based oxidants (SO2, elemental sulfur, and potentially H2S and S2) in ODHP.
4. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration of sulfur-containing catalysts.
5. Exploring the mechanism of sulfur incorporation into the catalyst structure and its impact on catalytic activity.

To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed to compare these sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants and to address the specific challenges associated with each.

该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，并略微提及元素硫。它没有直接比较H2S、S2和SO2与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果。

研究表明，SO2是一种有效的碳氢化合物脱氢氧化剂，包括丙烷。当与活性炭负载的氧化铁一起使用时，它可以产生高产率的丙烯。研究还表明，增加催化剂上预吸附的硫量会导致更高的丙烯产率。

元素硫被提及能够选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢，类似于硫化催化剂。然而，给定的文献中没有讨论具体的挑战、副产物形成以及与传统氧化剂的详细比较。

基于这项研究，未来研究的关键领域可能包括：
1. 研究硫在反应过程中形成的氧化缩合产物（OCP）中的作用。
2. 优化催化剂中的硫浓度以最大化丙烯产率。
3. 比较不同硫基氧化剂（SO2、元素硫，可能还有H2S和S2）在ODHP中的有效性和选择性。
4. 研究含硫催化剂的长期稳定性和再生。
5. 探索硫incorporation到催化剂结构中的机制及其对催化活性的影响。

为了全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究来比较这些硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂，并解决与每种氧化剂相关的具体挑战。
