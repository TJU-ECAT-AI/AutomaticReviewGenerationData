The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene at short contact times
over V2O5/A12O3 was remarkably enhanced by the introduction of H2S in
the feed mixture. Overall conversion of propane over this catalyst at 700 C
and 5 ms contact time was 53.7% with selectivity to propene of 56.5%,
providing a net propene yield of 30.4%.

Introduction
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of short-chain alkanes into their corresponding
olefins has been of great interest in recent years. This process provides an attractive alternate
route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking
and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower
temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative
routes. Vanadia- and molybdena-based oxide catalyst systems have been found to be effective
for this reaction, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities [1, 2].
Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses
with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and
subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower
than 30% [36]. Therefore, it is still very challenging to be able to carry out the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane with a high propene yield.
Many efforts have been made to gain high yields of propene in the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane. Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of
short-chain olefins. Schmidt and co-workers performed much of the pioneering work [7]. For
the propane ODH, up to 60% selectivity to total olefins (propene selectivity below 30%) at

nearly 100% conversion of propane has been achieved with a catalyst contact time of 5 ms at
8001000 C [8]. However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,
with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts [9]. In
addition, it has been shown that the addition of some mild oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O,
can effectively promote the selectivity for propene [10, 11].
While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation
of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge. Gaseous
doping with hydrogen sulfide was, however, investigated in the presence of a Pt/A12O3 catalyst
as to its effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation without O2, but
no apparent enhancement of propene formation was found [12]. Claims of selectivity benefits
can, however, be found within the patent literature from incorporation of H2S in the thermal
dehydrogenation of propane to propene for uncatalyzed systems [13, 14]. In this paper we
report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence
of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly
enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction
conditions.

Results and discussion
The test results for homogeneous oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 800 C with and
without H2S in the feed gas at various residence times are compared in table 1. The data in the
first five rows show the results of the gas-phase reaction of propane + O2 (C3H8: O2 = 4:1)
without H2S. Both C3H8 and O2 conversions declined with a decrease in the residence time
from 1.5 to 0.005. Ethylene was the predominant product although C3H6 selectivity increased
significantly with decreasing residence time. The large amount of CH4 and C2H4 in the product
mixture suggests that C3H8 cracking instead of dehydrogenation is the key reaction in the
homogeneous C3H8 + O2 reaction at 800 C.

Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, espe-
cially at residence times below 0.5 s. Although the conversions of C3H8 and O2 also declined
with decreasing residence times in the presence of H2S, it is of interest to note that both C3H8
and O2 conversions were markedly enhanced relative to the results without H2S. This leads to
a higher yield of propene in the presence of H2S as a gas-phase promoter by achieving higher
propene selectivity while maintaining a high conversion of C3H8 at the same time. As can be
seen from table 1, nearly 50% selectivity to propene with 75.6% conversion of propane was
obtained at 0.01s residence time, giving the highest propene yield of 37.6%. In comparison,
the yield of propene at the same residence time without H2S being present was only one-half
of this value. Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of H2S in the feed mixture has
a very significant promoting effect on the activity and selectivity to propene in this study. In
general, the results also show that short residence times can improve the selectivity and yield
of propene by effectively suppressing side reactions to some extent.
Table 2 shows the results for the catalytic performance ofA12O3 andV2O5/A12O3 catalysts
intheoxidativedehydrogenationofpropaneat700 Cand0.005 scontacttime.Forcomparison,
the results of gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 0.005 s residence time are
also presented. It can be seen that much lower conversions of C3H8 and O2, along with higher
selectivities to propene, were obtained in the homogeneous reaction at 700 C both with and
without H2S compared with the data in table 1 conducted at 800 C. With H2S in the feed
mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1%
propane at 700 C. No apparent differences in the activity and selectivity of products were
observed between A12O3 as a catalyst and the homogeneous reactions both with and without
H2S. In contrast, V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but
not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same
catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was
added to the feed gas.As can be seen from table 2, up to 56.5% propene selectivity with 53.7%
conversion of propane was obtained, providing a yield of propene of 30.4%. This value, to the
best of our knowledge, is higher than those reported in the literature for the catalytic oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of H2S. Indeed, when ethylene is taken into account
with propene, it is notable that the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst offers an olefin selectivity of up to
81% at a high propane conversion. It should be noted that the propene yield was only 19.7%
in the homogeneous reaction under the same conditions, so that the excellent performance of
V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S must be attributed to some feature of the catalyst
in the current investigation.

The effects of temperature on the catalytic ODH performance of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in
the presence of H2S with a 0.005 s contact time are shown in figure 1. This figure shows that
the conversion of C3H8 increased with reaction temperature, whereas that of H2S appeared
to decrease (figure 1A), while nearly all O2 was consumed at the studied temperatures rang-
ing from 500700 C. These observations can be interpreted in terms of the mechanism of
H2S-assisted ODH shown in scheme 1 that leads to re-formation of H2S, thus giving rise to an
apparently lower H2S conversion with increasing conversion of propane.

SCHEME 1
Figure 1 further shows that lower temperatures favored the selective formation of C3H6
(figure 1B) with up to 92% selectivity to propene being obtained at a temperature of 550 C.
The conversion of propane under this condition was, however, lower than 10%. Increasing the
temperature resulted in a decline in the selectivity to propene, but with apparently increased
selectivity to C2H4 and CH4. Interestingly, the selectivity to COx always stayed at a very
low level in the presence of the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, indicating that the over-oxidation of
hydrocarbons in the reaction was being suppressed. This can be attributed to the presence of
H2S in the reaction system, since much more COx was produced without H2S over the same
V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 C, as shown in table 2. Overall the yield of propene was noted to
increase (dashed line in figure 1B) with an increase in the temperature, although the selectivity
to propene declined significantly.
In recent years attempts to produce both hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide have
received considerable attention [15]. Work in our laboratory has further successfully demon-
strated that H2S can be effectively converted in to a mixture of sulfur, H2O and H2 by catalytic
partial oxidation at a 4:l H2S/O2 ratio using either α- or γ - alumina catalysts at short contact
times [16]. Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture
in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much
greater than with hydrocarbon. In particular over the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, it can be seen that
the selectivity to COx when H2S is present in the feed gas was much lower than without H2S
(table 2). The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would
suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is
recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed.

Conclusions
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to
propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving
propene yield. The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the
reaction conditions used for the present study. Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S
in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene. Accordingly, the best
propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of
H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C. Further work is currently in progress to
identify more active and selective catalysts, and also to elucidate the active role of H2S in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Experimental
Two commercial catalysts, γ -Al2O3 (Almatis, DD-431) and V2O5/A12O3 (Axens DN-115,
V2O5 loading = 13%), were used in this study. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was
carried out in a fixed-bed horizontal-flow quartz tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure and
high temperatures (600800 C). A larger, 10.7 mm i.d. quartz reactor was used for longer-
contact-time (or residence time) experiments, while a smaller, 8.1 mm i.d. reactor was used

for shorter-contact-time runs. In the case of gas-phase tests, an appropriate amount of quartz
chips (410 mesh) was placed in the reactor within the hot zone. The unoccupied volume
within this packed region was regarded as the main reaction zone, which was small enough to
run homogeneous ODH reactions at short residence times down to 5 ms. For catalytic ODH
experiments, the catalyst was packed at the beginning of the hot zone where the feed gases were
introduced. The catalyst packing volume ranged from 0.4 to 4 mL, corresponding to contact
times of 0.005 to 2 s.
Oxygen was premixed with nitrogen (used as an internal standard for analysis) and then
introduced through an inner quartz tube (i.d. = 5 mm) directly to the catalyst bed while the
mixture of propane/H2S or propane alone flowed onto the catalyst surface through the main
reactor tube. Such a design avoids the generation of possible explosive mixtures due to the
premixing of oxygen with flammable propane. Calculation of the contact time (tc) or resi-
dence time (tres) in the experiments was corrected to the actual reaction temperature using
equations (1) and (2).

Gas samples for analysis were withdrawn using a peristaltic pump connected to a capillary
quartz tube, which was placed immediately downstream of the catalyst bed. For homogeneous
gas-phase experiments, samples were retrieved with the same capillary system from the end
of the reaction zone.
Analysis of the reactants and products was performed by gas chromatography using several
SRI 8610 gas chromatographs equipped with TCD detectors. N2, O2 and CO were analyzed
on a 5Å molecular sieve column using He as carrier, and H2 was analyzed separately also
on a 5Å molecular sieve column but using argon as the carrier gas. Hydrocarbons (C1C3)
and sulfur-containing compounds (H2S, SO2, COS and CS2) as well as CO2 were analyzed
on a Poropak QS column using He as carrier and a temperature-programmed run. Analyses
were performed in triplicate after the reactor had been allowed to stabilize at the new process
conditions for 30 min. All experimental data presented here were shown to be reproducible.
Reported conversions, selectivities, and yields were calculated using equations (3)(5) and
N2 as an internal standard:
