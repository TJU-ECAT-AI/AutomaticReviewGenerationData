[1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "Nearly 50% selectivity to propene with 75.6% conversion of propane was obtained at 0.01s residence time, giving the highest propene yield of 37.6%. In comparison, the yield of propene at the same residence time without H2S being present was only one-half of this value."

[3] "Up to 56.5% propene selectivity with 53.7% conversion of propane was obtained, providing a yield of propene of 30.4%. This value, to the best of our knowledge, is higher than those reported in the literature for the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of H2S."

[4] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of S2 as a potential active species. The effectiveness of H2S is demonstrated through improved propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation without H2S.

H2S shows significant benefits:
1. Increased propylene selectivity and yield
2. Reduced formation of unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4)
3. Higher propane conversion rates

The study suggests that S2, produced from H2S oxidation, may act as an active species similar to O2 in the ODHP process. This mechanism allows for H2S recovery and suppression of COx byproducts.

Specific challenges associated with H2S include:
1. Potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts (not extensively discussed in the text)
2. Need for optimized reaction conditions (temperature, contact time)

The study does not provide information on SO2 as an oxidant for ODHP.

Key areas for future research include:
1. Identifying more active and selective catalysts
2. Further elucidating the role of H2S in the ODHP process
3. Optimizing reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield
4. Investigating the potential of S2 as a direct oxidant
5. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants and their effectiveness in ODHP

Overall, the use of H2S as an oxidant in ODHP shows promising results for improving propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation methods. Further research is needed to fully optimize the process and understand the mechanisms involved.

该研究主要关注H2S作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)生成丙烯的硫基氧化剂，并提到S2可能是一种活性物种。通过与不含H2S的常规氧化相比，H2S的效果表现为提高了丙烯产率和选择性。

H2S显示出显著的优势：
1. 提高丙烯选择性和产率
2. 减少不需要的副产品(COx, C2H4, CH4)的形成
3. 更高的丙烷转化率

研究表明，由H2S氧化产生的S2可能作为类似O2的活性物种参与ODHP过程。这种机制允许H2S的回收和抑制COx副产品的生成。

与H2S相关的具体挑战包括：
1. 可能形成含硫副产品（文中未详细讨论）
2. 需要优化反应条件（温度，接触时间）

该研究未提供SO2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息。

未来研究的关键领域包括：
1. 识别更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂
2. 进一步阐明H2S在ODHP过程中的作用
3. 优化反应条件以获得最大丙烯产率
4. 研究S2作为直接氧化剂的潜力
5. 探索其他硫基氧化剂及其在ODHP中的效果

总的来说，使用H2S作为ODHP的氧化剂在提高丙烯产率和选择性方面显示出比常规氧化方法更好的结果。需要进行进一步研究以充分优化该过程并理解所涉及的机制。
