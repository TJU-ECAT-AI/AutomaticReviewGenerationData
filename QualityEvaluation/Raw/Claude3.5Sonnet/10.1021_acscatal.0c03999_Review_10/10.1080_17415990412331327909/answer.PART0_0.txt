[1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."

[3] "V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was added to the feed gas."

[4] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."

[5] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

The study primarily focuses on comparing H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant to conventional oxidation with O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The introduction of H2S significantly improved propylene yield compared to conventional O2-only oxidation.

Key findings on H2S as an oxidant:
1. Increased propylene selectivity and reduced unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4)
2. Achieved up to 70% propylene selectivity at 700°C
3. Transformed V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst from COx-selective to propylene-selective
4. Suppressed over-oxidation reactions, leading to lower COx formation

The study suggests that S2, formed from the reaction of O2 with H2S, may act as the active oxidizing species. This process allows for H2S recovery while maintaining high propylene selectivity.

While SO2 was not directly studied as an oxidant, it was mentioned as a potential product in the analysis.

Challenges associated with H2S include:
1. Managing sulfur-containing byproducts (CS2, COS)
2. Optimizing reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield
3. Developing catalysts specifically designed for sulfur-based oxidants

Future research areas should focus on:
1. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., SO2) for ODHP
2. Optimizing catalyst design for sulfur-tolerant and highly selective materials
3. Understanding the reaction mechanism of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP
4. Improving overall process efficiency and economics, including sulfur recovery and management

In conclusion, sulfur-based oxidants, particularly H2S, show promise for improving propylene yield in ODHP compared to conventional O2-only oxidation. However, more research is needed to fully optimize the process and address challenges associated with using sulfur-containing compounds.

这项研究主要比较了以H2S作为含硫氧化剂与常规O2氧化在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。引入H2S显著提高了丙烯产率，相比仅使用O2的常规氧化方法。

关于H2S作为氧化剂的主要发现：
1. 提高了丙烯选择性，减少了不需要的副产物(COx, C2H4, CH4)
2. 在700°C下实现了高达70%的丙烯选择性
3. 将V2O5/Al2O3催化剂从COx选择性转变为丙烯选择性
4. 抑制了过度氧化反应，导致COx生成量降低

研究表明，由O2与H2S反应生成的S2可能作为活性氧化物种。这个过程允许H2S被回收，同时保持高丙烯选择性。

虽然SO2未被直接研究作为氧化剂，但在分析中被提及为潜在产物。

与H2S相关的挑战包括：
1. 管理含硫副产物(CS2, COS)
2. 优化反应条件以获得最大丙烯产率
3. 开发专门为含硫氧化剂设计的催化剂

未来研究方向应关注：
1. 探索其他含硫氧化剂(如SO2)用于ODHP
2. 优化催化剂设计，开发耐硫和高选择性材料
3. 理解含硫氧化剂在ODHP中的反应机理
4. 提高整体工艺效率和经济性，包括硫回收和管理

总之，含硫氧化剂，特别是H2S，在提高ODHP丙烯产率方面显示出了潜力，相比常规仅用O2氧化的方法。然而，还需要更多研究来充分优化这个过程，并解决使用含硫化合物相关的挑战。
