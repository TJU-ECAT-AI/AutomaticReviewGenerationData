[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

[2] "Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene. Accordingly, the best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C."

[3] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

[4] "Interestingly, the selectivity to COx always stayed at a very low level in the presence of the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, indicating that the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons in the reaction was being suppressed. This can be attributed to the presence of H2S in the reaction system, since much more COx was produced without H2S over the same V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 C, as shown in table 2."

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some discussion of S2 as an intermediate species. Conventional oxidants like O2 are also mentioned for comparison.

H2S shows significant promise as an oxidant for ODHP. It improves propylene yield substantially, with the best yield of 30.4% achieved over a V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700°C and 0.005s contact time. This yield is reported to be higher than those typically achieved without H2S.

The key advantages of H2S as an oxidant include:

1. Improved selectivity: H2S suppresses the formation of COx byproducts, leading to higher propylene selectivity.
2. Enhanced conversion: Both propane and O2 conversions were markedly improved with H2S present.
3. Regenerative process: H2S appears to be recovered in the reaction, potentially making it a more sustainable oxidant.

S2, formed as an intermediate from H2S oxidation, is suggested to act as the active oxidizing species. This may explain the selective nature of the oxidation, as S2 appears less likely to cause over-oxidation compared to O2.

The main challenges associated with H2S include:
1. The need for careful reactor design to avoid premature mixing of O2 and H2S.
2. Potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts (e.g., CS2, COS), though these were reported to be in small amounts.

Conventional O2 as an oxidant leads to higher COx formation and lower propylene selectivity, especially at higher temperatures.

Future research areas to improve the process could include:
1. Catalyst design to further enhance H2S utilization and propylene selectivity.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time, feed ratios) for maximum propylene yield.
3. Investigating the reaction mechanism, particularly the role of S2 as an active oxidant.
4. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., SO2) to compare their effectiveness with H2S.
5. Addressing potential issues with sulfur-containing byproducts and developing efficient separation methods.

While this study provides promising results for H2S as an oxidant in ODHP, more comprehensive comparisons with other sulfur-based oxidants (like SO2) would be beneficial for a fuller understanding of their relative effectiveness and challenges.

这项研究主要集中在使用H2S作为硫基氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯，并对S2作为中间物种进行了一些讨论。常规氧化剂如O2也被提及用作比较。

H2S作为ODHP的氧化剂显示出显著的潜力。它大大提高了丙烯的产率，在V2O5/Al2O3催化剂上，700°C和0.005秒接触时间的条件下，获得了30.4%的最佳产率。据报道，这个产率高于没有H2S时通常能达到的水平。

H2S作为氧化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 提高选择性：H2S抑制了COx副产物的形成，导致更高的丙烯选择性。
2. 提高转化率：有H2S存在时，丙烷和O2的转化率都明显提高。
3. 可再生过程：H2S似乎在反应中被回收，可能使其成为一种更可持续的氧化剂。

S2作为H2S氧化的中间产物，被认为是活性氧化物种。这可能解释了氧化的选择性特征，因为与O2相比，S2似乎不太可能导致过度氧化。

与H2S相关的主要挑战包括：
1. 需要谨慎设计反应器以避免O2和H2S过早混合。
2. 可能形成含硫副产物（如CS2，COS），尽管据报道这些副产物量很小。

常规的O2作为氧化剂会导致更高的COx生成和更低的丙烯选择性，尤其是在更高的温度下。

未来改进该过程的研究领域可能包括：
1. 催化剂设计，以进一步提高H2S的利用率和丙烯选择性。
2. 优化反应条件（温度、接触时间、进料比）以获得最大的丙烯产率。
3. 研究反应机理，特别是S2作为活性氧化剂的作用。
4. 探索其他硫基氧化剂（如SO2）以比较它们与H2S的效果。
5. 解决含硫副产物可能带来的问题，并开发高效的分离方法。

虽然这项研究为H2S作为ODHP的氧化剂提供了有前景的结果，但与其他硫基氧化剂（如SO2）进行更全面的比较将有助于更全面地了解它们的相对效果和挑战。
