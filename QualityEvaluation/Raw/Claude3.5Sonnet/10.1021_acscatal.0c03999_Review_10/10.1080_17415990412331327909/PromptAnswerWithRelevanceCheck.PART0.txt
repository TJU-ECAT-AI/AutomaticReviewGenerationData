[1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."

[3] "V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was added to the feed gas."

[4] "Indeed, considerable amounts of S2 have been observed in the product mixture in the present study, which would indicate that the rate of reaction of O2 with H2S is much greater than with hydrocarbon."

[5] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

The study primarily focuses on comparing H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant to conventional oxidation with O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The introduction of H2S significantly improved propylene yield compared to conventional O2-only oxidation.

Key findings on H2S as an oxidant:
1. Increased propylene selectivity and reduced unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4)
2. Achieved up to 70% propylene selectivity at 700°C
3. Transformed V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst from COx-selective to propylene-selective
4. Suppressed over-oxidation reactions, leading to lower COx formation

The study suggests that S2, formed from the reaction of O2 with H2S, may act as the active oxidizing species. This process allows for H2S recovery while maintaining high propylene selectivity.

While SO2 was not directly studied as an oxidant, it was mentioned as a potential product in the analysis.

Challenges associated with H2S include:
1. Managing sulfur-containing byproducts (CS2, COS)
2. Optimizing reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield
3. Developing catalysts specifically designed for sulfur-based oxidants

Future research areas should focus on:
1. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., SO2) for ODHP
2. Optimizing catalyst design for sulfur-tolerant and highly selective materials
3. Understanding the reaction mechanism of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP
4. Improving overall process efficiency and economics, including sulfur recovery and management

In conclusion, sulfur-based oxidants, particularly H2S, show promise for improving propylene yield in ODHP compared to conventional O2-only oxidation. However, more research is needed to fully optimize the process and address challenges associated with using sulfur-containing compounds.

这项研究主要比较了以H2S作为含硫氧化剂与常规O2氧化在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。引入H2S显著提高了丙烯产率，相比仅使用O2的常规氧化方法。

关于H2S作为氧化剂的主要发现：
1. 提高了丙烯选择性，减少了不需要的副产物(COx, C2H4, CH4)
2. 在700°C下实现了高达70%的丙烯选择性
3. 将V2O5/Al2O3催化剂从COx选择性转变为丙烯选择性
4. 抑制了过度氧化反应，导致COx生成量降低

研究表明，由O2与H2S反应生成的S2可能作为活性氧化物种。这个过程允许H2S被回收，同时保持高丙烯选择性。

虽然SO2未被直接研究作为氧化剂，但在分析中被提及为潜在产物。

与H2S相关的挑战包括：

未来研究方向应关注：
1. 探索其他含硫氧化剂(如SO2)用于ODHP
2. 优化催化剂设计，开发耐硫和高选择性材料
3. 理解含硫氧化剂在ODHP中的反应机理
4. 提高整体工艺效率和经济性，包括硫回收和管理

总之，含硫氧化剂，特别是H2S，在提高ODHP丙烯产率方面显示出了潜力，相比常规仅用O2氧化的方法。然而，还需要更多研究来充分优化这个过程，并解决使用含硫化合物相关的挑战。

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some discussion of S2 as an active species. The effectiveness of H2S is compared to conventional oxidation without H2S:

1. Impact on propylene yield: H2S significantly improved propylene yield. The best yield achieved was 30.4% with H2S, compared to much lower yields without H2S.

2. Selectivity: H2S increased propylene selectivity, with up to 70% selectivity achieved at 700°C. It also reduced the formation of byproducts like COx, C2H4, and CH4.

3. Catalyst performance: V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst was ineffective for ODHP without H2S, producing mainly COx. With H2S, it became an effective catalyst for propylene production.

4. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that S2, formed from H2S oxidation, acts as an active species similar to O2 in carrying out selective ODHP. This mechanism suppresses COx formation and allows H2S to be recovered.

5. Challenges: The study doesn't explicitly discuss challenges, but managing sulfur compounds in the product stream would likely be a consideration.

6. Future research areas: The paper suggests further work to identify more active and selective catalysts and to elucidate the active role of H2S in ODHP.

The study does not provide information on SO2 as an oxidant for ODHP. To fully compare different sulfur-based oxidants, additional research would be needed on SO2 and other potential sulfur compounds in this reaction.

该研究主要关注H2S作为硫基氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯，并对S2作为活性物种进行了一些讨论。H2S的效果与不含H2S的常规氧化进行了比较：

1. 对丙烯产率的影响：H2S显著提高了丙烯产率。使用H2S时获得的最佳产率为30.4%，而不使用H2S时产率要低得多。

2. 选择性：H2S提高了丙烯的选择性，在700°C时可达到70%的选择性。它还降低了COx、C2H4和CH4等副产物的形成。

3. 催化剂性能：没有H2S时，V2O5/Al2O3催化剂对ODHP无效，主要产生COx。加入H2S后，它成为丙烯生产的有效催化剂。

4. 反应机理：研究表明，由H2S氧化形成的S2作为类似O2的活性物种，可进行选择性ODHP。这种机制抑制了COx的形成，并允许H2S被回收。

5. 挑战：研究没有明确讨论挑战，但管理产品流中的硫化物可能是一个需要考虑的问题。

6. 未来研究方向：论文建议进一步研究以识别更活跃和选择性的催化剂，并阐明H2S在ODHP中的活性作用。

该研究没有提供关于SO2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息。要全面比较不同的硫基氧化剂，还需要对SO2和其他潜在的硫化物在这个反应中的作用进行额外研究。

Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "Nearly 50% selectivity to propene with 75.6% conversion of propane was obtained at 0.01s residence time, giving the highest propene yield of 37.6%. In comparison, the yield of propene at the same residence time without H2S being present was only one-half of this value."

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of S2 as a potential active species. The effectiveness of H2S is demonstrated through improved propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation without H2S.

H2S shows significant benefits:
1. Increased propylene selectivity and yield
2. Reduced formation of unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4)

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of S2 as a potential active species. The effectiveness of H2S is compared to conventional oxidation using O2 alone.

H2S showed significant benefits over conventional O2 oxidation:

1. Improved propylene yield: The best yield achieved was 30.4% with H2S present, which is higher than typical yields reported in literature for ODHP without H2S.

2. Increased selectivity: H2S addition resulted in up to 70% selectivity to propylene at 700°C, compared to much lower selectivity with O2 alone.

The study suggests that S2, formed from H2S oxidation, may act as an active species similar to O2 in carrying out selective ODHP. This mechanism allows for H2S recovery and suppression of COx products.

The main challenge associated with H2S as an oxidant is the need to handle a toxic gas, which may require additional safety measures.

Key areas for future research include:

1. Identifying more active and selective catalysts specifically for H2S-assisted ODHP.
2. Elucidating the exact role of H2S and potential S2 species in the reaction mechanism.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time, H2S:O2 ratio) to maximize propylene yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.
4. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under H2S-rich conditions.
5. Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., SO2) in ODHP, which were not directly studied in this work.

While the study demonstrates the potential of H2S as an effective oxidant for ODHP, more research is needed to fully understand and optimize the process for potential industrial application.

该研究主要关注H2S作为硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的应用，并提到S2可能作为活性物种。H2S的效果与传统的单独使用O2进行氧化进行了比较。

H2S相比传统O2氧化显示出显著优势：

1. 提高丙烯产率：在H2S存在下，最佳产率达到30.4%，高于文献报道的无H2S参与的ODHP典型产率。

2. 提高选择性：在700°C下，添加H2S可使丙烯选择性达到70%，远高于单独使用O2时的选择性。

3. 减少副产物：与O2氧化相比，H2S显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成。

4. 催化剂效果：V2O5/Al2O3催化剂在单独使用O2时对丙烯生成无效，但添加H2S后变得高效。

研究表明，H2S氧化形成的S2可能作为类似O2的活性物种进行选择性ODHP。这种机制允许H2S回收并抑制COx产物生成。

使用H2S作为氧化剂的主要挑战是需要处理有毒气体，可能需要额外的安全措施。

未来研究的关键领域包括：

1. 识别更活跃、更选择性的催化剂，专门用于H2S辅助的ODHP。
2. 阐明H2S和潜在S2物种在反应机理中的确切作用。
3. 优化反应条件（温度、接触时间、H2S:O2比例）以最大化丙烯产率并最小化不需要的副产物。
4. 研究催化剂在富H2S条件下的长期稳定性和再生。
5. 探索其他硫基氧化剂（如SO2）在ODHP中的潜力，这在本研究中未直接研究。

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

[2] "Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene. Accordingly, the best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C."

[4] "Interestingly, the selectivity to COx always stayed at a very low level in the presence of the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, indicating that the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons in the reaction was being suppressed. This can be attributed to the presence of H2S in the reaction system, since much more COx was produced without H2S over the same V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 C, as shown in table 2."

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some discussion of S2 as an intermediate species. Conventional oxidants like O2 are also mentioned for comparison.

H2S shows significant promise as an oxidant for ODHP. It improves propylene yield substantially, with the best yield of 30.4% achieved over a V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700°C and 0.005s contact time. This yield is reported to be higher than those typically achieved without H2S.

The key advantages of H2S as an oxidant include:

1. Improved selectivity: H2S suppresses the formation of COx byproducts, leading to higher propylene selectivity.
2. Enhanced conversion: Both propane and O2 conversions were markedly improved with H2S present.
3. Regenerative process: H2S appears to be recovered in the reaction, potentially making it a more sustainable oxidant.

S2, formed as an intermediate from H2S oxidation, is suggested to act as the active oxidizing species. This may explain the selective nature of the oxidation, as S2 appears less likely to cause over-oxidation compared to O2.

The main challenges associated with H2S include:
1. The need for careful reactor design to avoid premature mixing of O2 and H2S.
2. Potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts (e.g., CS2, COS), though these were reported to be in small amounts.

Conventional O2 as an oxidant leads to higher COx formation and lower propylene selectivity, especially at higher temperatures.

Future research areas to improve the process could include:
1. Catalyst design to further enhance H2S utilization and propylene selectivity.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time, feed ratios) for maximum propylene yield.
3. Investigating the reaction mechanism, particularly the role of S2 as an active oxidant.
4. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., SO2) to compare their effectiveness with H2S.
5. Addressing potential issues with sulfur-containing byproducts and developing efficient separation methods.

While this study provides promising results for H2S as an oxidant in ODHP, more comprehensive comparisons with other sulfur-based oxidants (like SO2) would be beneficial for a fuller understanding of their relative effectiveness and challenges.

这项研究主要集中在使用H2S作为硫基氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯，并对S2作为中间物种进行了一些讨论。常规氧化剂如O2也被提及用作比较。

H2S作为ODHP的氧化剂显示出显著的潜力。它大大提高了丙烯的产率，在V2O5/Al2O3催化剂上，700°C和0.005秒接触时间的条件下，获得了30.4%的最佳产率。据报道，这个产率高于没有H2S时通常能达到的水平。

H2S作为氧化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 提高选择性：H2S抑制了COx副产物的形成，导致更高的丙烯选择性。
2. 提高转化率：有H2S存在时，丙烷和O2的转化率都明显提高。
3. 可再生过程：H2S似乎在反应中被回收，可能使其成为一种更可持续的氧化剂。

S2作为H2S氧化的中间产物，被认为是活性氧化物种。这可能解释了氧化的选择性特征，因为与O2相比，S2似乎不太可能导致过度氧化。

与H2S相关的主要挑战包括：
1. 需要谨慎设计反应器以避免O2和H2S过早混合。
2. 可能形成含硫副产物（如CS2，COS），尽管据报道这些副产物量很小。

常规的O2作为氧化剂会导致更高的COx生成和更低的丙烯选择性，尤其是在更高的温度下。

未来改进该过程的研究领域可能包括：
1. 催化剂设计，以进一步提高H2S的利用率和丙烯选择性。
2. 优化反应条件（温度、接触时间、进料比）以获得最大的丙烯产率。
3. 研究反应机理，特别是S2作为活性氧化剂的作用。
4. 探索其他硫基氧化剂（如SO2）以比较它们与H2S的效果。
5. 解决含硫副产物可能带来的问题，并开发高效的分离方法。

虽然这项研究为H2S作为ODHP的氧化剂提供了有前景的结果，但与其他硫基氧化剂（如SO2）进行更全面的比较将有助于更全面地了解它们的相对效果和挑战。
