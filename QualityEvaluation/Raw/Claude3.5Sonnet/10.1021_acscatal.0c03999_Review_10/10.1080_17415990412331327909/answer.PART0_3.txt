[1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly."

[2] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."

[3] "V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was added to the feed gas."

[4] "Accordingly, the best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C."

[5] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some mention of S2 as a potential active species. The effectiveness of H2S is compared to conventional oxidation using O2 alone.

H2S showed significant benefits over conventional O2 oxidation:

1. Improved propylene yield: The best yield achieved was 30.4% with H2S present, which is higher than typical yields reported in literature for ODHP without H2S.

2. Increased selectivity: H2S addition resulted in up to 70% selectivity to propylene at 700°C, compared to much lower selectivity with O2 alone.

3. Reduced byproducts: H2S significantly reduced the formation of COx, C2H4, and CH4 compared to O2 oxidation.

4. Catalyst effectiveness: V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst, which was ineffective for propylene formation with O2 alone, became highly effective when H2S was added.

The study suggests that S2, formed from H2S oxidation, may act as an active species similar to O2 in carrying out selective ODHP. This mechanism allows for H2S recovery and suppression of COx products.

The main challenge associated with H2S as an oxidant is the need to handle a toxic gas, which may require additional safety measures.

Key areas for future research include:

1. Identifying more active and selective catalysts specifically for H2S-assisted ODHP.
2. Elucidating the exact role of H2S and potential S2 species in the reaction mechanism.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time, H2S:O2 ratio) to maximize propylene yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.
4. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under H2S-rich conditions.
5. Exploring the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., SO2) in ODHP, which were not directly studied in this work.

While the study demonstrates the potential of H2S as an effective oxidant for ODHP, more research is needed to fully understand and optimize the process for potential industrial application.

该研究主要关注H2S作为硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的应用，并提到S2可能作为活性物种。H2S的效果与传统的单独使用O2进行氧化进行了比较。

H2S相比传统O2氧化显示出显著优势：

1. 提高丙烯产率：在H2S存在下，最佳产率达到30.4%，高于文献报道的无H2S参与的ODHP典型产率。

2. 提高选择性：在700°C下，添加H2S可使丙烯选择性达到70%，远高于单独使用O2时的选择性。

3. 减少副产物：与O2氧化相比，H2S显著减少了COx、C2H4和CH4的生成。

4. 催化剂效果：V2O5/Al2O3催化剂在单独使用O2时对丙烯生成无效，但添加H2S后变得高效。

研究表明，H2S氧化形成的S2可能作为类似O2的活性物种进行选择性ODHP。这种机制允许H2S回收并抑制COx产物生成。

使用H2S作为氧化剂的主要挑战是需要处理有毒气体，可能需要额外的安全措施。

未来研究的关键领域包括：

1. 识别更活跃、更选择性的催化剂，专门用于H2S辅助的ODHP。
2. 阐明H2S和潜在S2物种在反应机理中的确切作用。
3. 优化反应条件（温度、接触时间、H2S:O2比例）以最大化丙烯产率并最小化不需要的副产物。
4. 研究催化剂在富H2S条件下的长期稳定性和再生。
5. 探索其他硫基氧化剂（如SO2）在ODHP中的潜力，这在本研究中未直接研究。

虽然研究表明H2S作为ODHP的有效氧化剂具有潜力，但仍需要更多研究以充分理解和优化该工艺，以便潜在的工业应用。
