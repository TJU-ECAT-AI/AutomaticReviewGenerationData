[1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."

[3] "V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was added to the feed gas."

[4] "Accordingly, the best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C."

[5] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

The study primarily focuses on H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with some discussion of S2 as an active species. The effectiveness of H2S is compared to conventional oxidation without H2S:

1. Impact on propylene yield: H2S significantly improved propylene yield. The best yield achieved was 30.4% with H2S, compared to much lower yields without H2S.

2. Selectivity: H2S increased propylene selectivity, with up to 70% selectivity achieved at 700°C. It also reduced the formation of byproducts like COx, C2H4, and CH4.

3. Catalyst performance: V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst was ineffective for ODHP without H2S, producing mainly COx. With H2S, it became an effective catalyst for propylene production.

4. Reaction mechanism: The study suggests that S2, formed from H2S oxidation, acts as an active species similar to O2 in carrying out selective ODHP. This mechanism suppresses COx formation and allows H2S to be recovered.

5. Challenges: The study doesn't explicitly discuss challenges, but managing sulfur compounds in the product stream would likely be a consideration.

6. Future research areas: The paper suggests further work to identify more active and selective catalysts and to elucidate the active role of H2S in ODHP.

The study does not provide information on SO2 as an oxidant for ODHP. To fully compare different sulfur-based oxidants, additional research would be needed on SO2 and other potential sulfur compounds in this reaction.

该研究主要关注H2S作为硫基氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯，并对S2作为活性物种进行了一些讨论。H2S的效果与不含H2S的常规氧化进行了比较：

1. 对丙烯产率的影响：H2S显著提高了丙烯产率。使用H2S时获得的最佳产率为30.4%，而不使用H2S时产率要低得多。

2. 选择性：H2S提高了丙烯的选择性，在700°C时可达到70%的选择性。它还降低了COx、C2H4和CH4等副产物的形成。

3. 催化剂性能：没有H2S时，V2O5/Al2O3催化剂对ODHP无效，主要产生COx。加入H2S后，它成为丙烯生产的有效催化剂。

4. 反应机理：研究表明，由H2S氧化形成的S2作为类似O2的活性物种，可进行选择性ODHP。这种机制抑制了COx的形成，并允许H2S被回收。

5. 挑战：研究没有明确讨论挑战，但管理产品流中的硫化物可能是一个需要考虑的问题。

6. 未来研究方向：论文建议进一步研究以识别更活跃和选择性的催化剂，并阐明H2S在ODHP中的活性作用。

该研究没有提供关于SO2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息。要全面比较不同的硫基氧化剂，还需要对SO2和其他潜在的硫化物在这个反应中的作用进行额外研究。
