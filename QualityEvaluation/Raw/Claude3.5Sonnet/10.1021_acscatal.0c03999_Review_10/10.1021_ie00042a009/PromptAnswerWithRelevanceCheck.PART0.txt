Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants or conventional oxidants. The document primarily focuses on coke formation during thermal cracking of hydrocarbons and the effects of various sulfur compounds on this process. It does not discuss ODHP or propylene production. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison of different oxidants for ODHP based on the information in this document.

给定的文献不包含任何关于使用硫基氧化剂或传统氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的信息。该文档主要关注碳氢化合物热裂解过程中的结焦形成以及各种硫化物对这一过程的影响。它没有讨论ODHP或丙烯生产。因此,我无法根据本文档中的信息对ODHP的不同氧化剂进行有意义的比较。
