Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on the oxychlorination of ethane and propane to produce ethylene and propylene using a europium oxychloride (EuOCl) catalyst. It does not discuss sulfur-based oxidants or compare them with conventional oxidants in ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the information given in this document.

The given literature does not contain information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on the use of europium oxychloride (EuOCl) as a catalyst for the oxychlorination of ethane and propane to produce ethylene and propylene, respectively. It does not discuss sulfur-based oxidants or their impact on propylene yield in ODHP reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for ODHP based on this specific literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含关于硫基氧化剂或它们与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)生产丙烯方面的比较信息。该文档主要集中讨论了使用氧氯化铕(EuOCl)作为催化剂，用于乙烷和丙烷的氧氯化反应，分别生产乙烯和丙烯。它没有讨论硫基氧化剂或它们对ODHP反应中丙烯产率的影响。因此，我无法根据这篇特定的文献提供硫基氧化剂与常规氧化剂在ODHP中的比较。
