If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The document focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using various metal oxide catalysts and other non-sulfur based systems. Without relevant information, I cannot compare the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants or discuss their impact on propylene yield, challenges, or areas for future research in propane dehydrogenation.

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The text primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene using various metal oxide and chloride catalysts. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or sulfur-based oxidants. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation based on the information given in this document.
