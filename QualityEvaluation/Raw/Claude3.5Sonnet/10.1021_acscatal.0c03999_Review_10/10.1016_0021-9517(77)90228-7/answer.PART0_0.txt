[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."

[3] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions, however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, and does not provide direct comparisons with H2S or S2. However, based on the information provided, we can draw some conclusions about SO2 as an oxidant:

1. SO2 increases the conversion of propane compared to pure propane feed, suggesting it is effective at promoting the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. However, the selectivity to propylene is significantly lower when SO2 is used, indicating that it leads to more undesired side reactions.

3. The mechanism of SO2 as an oxidant involves abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

4. A major challenge with SO2 is that it can further oxidize the desired propylene product to water and carbon dioxide, reducing selectivity.

The study does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, so we cannot make direct comparisons. However, it does highlight some key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the ODHP process:

1. Developing catalysts that can maintain high propylene selectivity while using SO2 as an oxidant.

2. Understanding and mitigating the mechanism by which SO2 oxidizes propylene to CO2 and water.

3. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (like H2S or S2) to determine if they offer better selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates.

4. Investigating catalyst modifications or process conditions that could minimize the formation of undesired byproducts like CO2.

5. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under sulfur-containing reaction conditions.

Overall, while SO2 shows promise in increasing propane conversion, significant challenges remain in improving selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions. Future research should focus on addressing these issues and exploring alternative sulfur-based oxidants for ODHP.

该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)生成丙烯的氧化剂，并未直接与H2S或S2进行比较。然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以得出一些关于SO2作为氧化剂的结论：

1. 与纯丙烷进料相比，SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，表明它能有效促进脱氢反应。

2. 然而，使用SO2时丙烯的选择性显著降低，说明它导致了更多不需要的副反应。

3. SO2作为氧化剂的机理涉及从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。

4. SO2的一个主要挑战是它可能进一步氧化所需的丙烯产品，生成水和二氧化碳，从而降低选择性。

研究没有提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的信息，因此我们无法直接比较。但是，它确实突出了一些改进催化剂设计和优化ODHP过程的关键研究领域：

1. 开发能在使用SO2作为氧化剂的同时保持高丙烯选择性的催化剂。

2. 理解并减轻SO2将丙烯氧化成CO2和水的机理。

3. 探索其他含硫氧化剂（如H2S或S2），以确定它们是否能在保持高转化率的同时提供更好的选择性。

4. 研究催化剂改性或工艺条件，以最大限度地减少CO2等不需要的副产品的形成。

5. 研究催化剂在含硫反应条件下的长期稳定性和再生。

总的来说，虽然SO2在增加丙烷转化率方面显示出前景，但在提高选择性和减少不需要的副反应方面仍然存在重大挑战。未来的研究应该集中在解决这些问题，并探索ODHP的替代含硫氧化剂。
