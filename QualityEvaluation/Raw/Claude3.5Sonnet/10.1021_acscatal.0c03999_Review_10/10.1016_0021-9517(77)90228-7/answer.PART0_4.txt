[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."

[3] "SO2 seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed. These were detected by glc analysis."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with limited information on other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. Effectiveness of SO2:
- SO2 increases the conversion of propane compared to pure propane feed.
- However, selectivity to propylene is significantly lower when SO2 is added.
- SO2 abstracts hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

2. Challenges with SO2:
- Lower selectivity to propylene compared to conventional dehydrogenation.
- Potential oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, further reducing yield.
- Formation of undesired byproducts (H2S, CO2) that may require additional separation steps.

3. Comparison to conventional oxidants:
- The study does not directly compare SO2 to conventional oxidants, but it does mention that SO2 offers an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in the reaction.

4. Areas for future research:
- Improving catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propylene when using SO2.
- Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) to compare their effectiveness and byproduct formation.
- Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst composition) to maximize propylene yield while minimizing undesired side reactions.
- Developing efficient separation techniques for byproducts like H2S and CO2.

In conclusion, while SO2 shows potential for increasing propane conversion in ODHP, significant challenges remain in terms of selectivity and byproduct formation. Further research is needed to fully assess the viability of sulfur-based oxidants compared to conventional oxidants in this process.

该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的氧化剂，对其他硫基氧化剂如H2S或S2的信息有限。但是，可以从现有信息中得出一些见解：

1. SO2的有效性：
- 与纯丙烷进料相比，SO2增加了丙烷的转化率。
- 然而，添加SO2时丙烯的选择性显著降低。
- SO2从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。

2. 使用SO2的挑战：
- 与常规脱氢相比，丙烯的选择性较低。
- 丙烯可能被氧化成水和二氧化碳，进一步降低产率。
- 形成不需要的副产品（H2S，CO2），可能需要额外的分离步骤。

3. 与传统氧化剂的比较：
- 该研究没有直接将SO2与传统氧化剂进行比较，但提到SO2提供了一种克服反应平衡限制的替代方法。

4. 未来研究领域：
- 改进催化剂设计，以提高使用SO2时对丙烯的选择性。
- 研究其他硫基氧化剂（H2S，S2），比较它们的有效性和副产品形成情况。
- 优化反应条件（温度、压力、催化剂组成），以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
- 开发高效的分离技术，用于H2S和CO2等副产品。

总之，虽然SO2显示出增加ODHP中丙烷转化率的潜力，但在选择性和副产品形成方面仍然存在重大挑战。需要进一步研究以全面评估硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在这一过程中的可行性。
