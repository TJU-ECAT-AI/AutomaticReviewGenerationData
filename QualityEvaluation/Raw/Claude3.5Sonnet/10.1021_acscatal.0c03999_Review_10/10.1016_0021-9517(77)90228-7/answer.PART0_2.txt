[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."

[3] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions, however, SO2 seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, and does not provide direct comparisons with H2S or S2. However, based on the information provided, we can draw some conclusions about SO2's effectiveness in ODHP:

1. SO2 increases the conversion of propane compared to pure propane feed, indicating its potential as an oxidant for ODHP.

2. However, the selectivity to propylene is significantly lower when SO2 is used, compared to pure propane dehydrogenation.

3. The mechanism of SO2 in ODHP involves abstracting hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.

4. A major challenge with SO2 as an oxidant is the potential for over-oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, leading to lower selectivity.

The study does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, so direct comparisons cannot be made. Future research areas to improve catalyst design and optimize the process could include:

1. Developing catalysts that minimize over-oxidation of propylene when using SO2.
2. Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (like H2S and S2) to compare their effectiveness with SO2.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst composition) to maximize propylene yield and selectivity.
4. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under sulfur-containing environments.

该文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的氧化剂，没有与H2S或S2进行直接比较。但是，根据提供的信息，我们可以得出一些关于SO2在ODHP中效果的结论：

1. 与纯丙烷进料相比，SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，表明其作为ODHP氧化剂的潜力。

2. 然而，使用SO2时，丙烯的选择性明显低于纯丙烷脱氢。

3. SO2在ODHP中的机理涉及从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。

4. 使用SO2作为氧化剂的一个主要挑战是丙烯可能被过度氧化成水和二氧化碳，导致选择性降低。

该研究没有提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。为改进催化剂设计和优化工艺，未来的研究领域可能包括：

1. 开发在使用SO2时能最大限度减少丙烯过度氧化的催化剂。
2. 研究其他含硫氧化剂（如H2S和S2），比较它们与SO2的效果。
3. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、催化剂组成）以最大化丙烯产率和选择性。
4. 研究催化剂在含硫环境下的长期稳定性。
