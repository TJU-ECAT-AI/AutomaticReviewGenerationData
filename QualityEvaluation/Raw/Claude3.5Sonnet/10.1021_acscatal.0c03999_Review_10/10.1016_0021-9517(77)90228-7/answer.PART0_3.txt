[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[3] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed. These were detected by glc analysis."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The literature focuses primarily on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with limited information on other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2. Based on the provided information:

1. Effectiveness of SO2:
- SO2 increases the conversion of propane compared to pure propane feed.
- However, the selectivity to propylene is significantly lower when SO2 is used.

2. Reaction mechanism and byproducts:
- SO2 abstracts hydrogen from propane, forming hydrogen sulfide and water as byproducts.
- SO2 can also oxidize propylene to water and carbon dioxide, contributing to the lower selectivity.

3. Challenges:
- The main challenge with SO2 is the low selectivity to propylene, which offsets the increased conversion.
- Formation of undesired byproducts (H2S, H2O, CO2) reduces the efficiency of the process.

4. Areas for future research:
- Improving catalyst design to enhance selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates.
- Investigating ways to minimize the oxidation of propylene by SO2.
- Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) to compare their effectiveness with SO2.
- Optimizing reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between SO2 and conventional oxidants or other sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP. Further research would be needed to make comprehensive comparisons and determine the most effective oxidants for this process.

该文献主要关注二氧化硫（SO2）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯的氧化剂，对其他含硫氧化剂如H2S或S2的信息有限。根据提供的信息：

1. SO2的有效性：
- 与纯丙烷进料相比，SO2增加了丙烷的转化率。
- 然而，使用SO2时丙烯的选择性显著降低。

2. 反应机理和副产品：
- SO2从丙烷中提取氢，形成硫化氢和水作为副产品。
- SO2还可以将丙烯氧化成水和二氧化碳，导致选择性降低。

3. 挑战：
- SO2的主要挑战是对丙烯的低选择性，这抵消了转化率的增加。
- 不良副产品（H2S、H2O、CO2）的形成降低了过程的效率。

4. 未来研究领域：
- 改进催化剂设计，在保持高转化率的同时提高选择性。
- 研究最小化SO2对丙烯氧化的方法。
- 探索其他含硫氧化剂（H2S、S2），比较它们与SO2的有效性。
- 优化反应条件，平衡转化率和选择性。

该文献没有直接比较SO2与传统氧化剂或其他含硫氧化剂在ODHP中的效果。需要进一步研究才能进行全面比较，并确定此过程最有效的氧化剂。
