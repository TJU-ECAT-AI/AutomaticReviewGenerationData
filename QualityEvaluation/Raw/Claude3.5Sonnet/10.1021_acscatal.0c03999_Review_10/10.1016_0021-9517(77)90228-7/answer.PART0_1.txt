[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[3] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed. These were detected by glc analysis."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, and does not provide direct comparisons with H2S or S2. However, based on the information provided, we can draw some conclusions about SO2 as an oxidant:

1. SO2 increases the conversion of propane compared to pure propane feed, indicating its effectiveness in promoting the reaction.

2. However, the selectivity to propylene is significantly lower when SO2 is used, suggesting that it leads to unwanted side reactions.

3. The main mechanism of SO2 in ODHP appears to be hydrogen abstraction from propane, forming H2S and H2O as byproducts.

4. A major challenge with SO2 is its tendency to over-oxidize propylene to CO2 and H2O, reducing selectivity.

The study doesn't provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, so their effectiveness cannot be directly compared. 

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the process include:

1. Developing catalysts that can maintain high selectivity to propylene while using SO2 as an oxidant.
2. Investigating ways to minimize the over-oxidation of propylene to CO2.
3. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (like H2S or S2) to compare their effectiveness and selectivity with SO2.
4. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under sulfur-containing environments.
5. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratios) to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

这篇文献主要关注SO2作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯的氧化剂，没有直接与H2S或S2进行比较。但根据所提供的信息，我们可以得出一些关于SO2作为氧化剂的结论：

1. 与纯丙烷进料相比，SO2增加了丙烷的转化率，表明其在促进反应方面的有效性。

2. 然而，使用SO2时丙烯的选择性显著降低，这表明它会导致不必要的副反应。

3. SO2在ODHP中的主要机制似乎是从丙烷中提取氢，形成H2S和H2O作为副产品。

4. SO2的一个主要挑战是它倾向于过度氧化丙烯生成CO2和H2O，降低了选择性。

这项研究没有提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的信息，因此无法直接比较它们的效果。

未来改进催化剂设计和优化过程的关键研究领域包括：

1. 开发在使用SO2作为氧化剂的同时能保持高丙烯选择性的催化剂。
2. 研究最小化丙烯过度氧化生成CO2的方法。
3. 探索其他含硫氧化剂（如H2S或S2），比较它们与SO2的效果和选择性。
4. 研究催化剂在含硫环境下的长期稳定性。
5. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、反应物比例）以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化副产物的形成。
