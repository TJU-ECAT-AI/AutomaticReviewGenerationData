Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document appears to focus on the effect of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane over Cr/ZrO2 catalysts. Without relevant information from the provided text, it is not possible to accurately compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in ODHP, discuss their impact on propylene yield, address specific challenges associated with each oxidant, or suggest key areas for future research in catalyst design and process optimization.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于硫基氧化剂或其与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的比较的信息。该文件似乎主要关注CO2在Cr/ZrO2催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的作用。由于缺乏相关文本信息，无法准确比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂与常规氧化剂在ODHP中的效果，讨论它们对丙烯产率的影响，解决与每种氧化剂相关的具体挑战，或建议催化剂设计和工艺优化的未来研究重点领域。
