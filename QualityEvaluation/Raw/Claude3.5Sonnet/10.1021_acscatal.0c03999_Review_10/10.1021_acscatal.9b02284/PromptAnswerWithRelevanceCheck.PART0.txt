Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The text appears to be a title and author information for a research article about supported boron oxide catalysts for ODHP, but does not provide any details about the catalytic process or oxidants used. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants, their impact on propylene yield, associated challenges, or areas for future research based on this limited information.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的文献中没有关于硫基氧化剂或其与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的比较的任何信息。这段文字似乎是一篇关于用于ODHP的负载型氧化硼催化剂的研究文章的标题和作者信息，但没有提供任何关于催化过程或所用氧化剂的详细信息。因此，基于这些有限的信息，我无法提供关于不同硫基氧化剂、它们对丙烯产率的影响、相关挑战或未来研究领域的比较。

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The text appears to be just a title and author information for a research article about boron oxide catalysts for ODHP. Without access to the full text or additional information, it is not possible to answer the question about comparing different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in ODHP.
