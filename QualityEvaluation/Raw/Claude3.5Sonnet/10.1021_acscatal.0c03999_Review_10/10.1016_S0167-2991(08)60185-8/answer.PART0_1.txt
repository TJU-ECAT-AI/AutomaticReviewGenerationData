[1] "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

[2] "Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts."

[3] "For identical reaction mixture compositions, the composition of OCP formed is also similar (Table 2). As the surface of catalysts is packed with OCP, their activities become similar."

[4] "The result obtained is in agreement with (ref. 3) indicating that for Pd/Al2O3 activity and selectivity towards propylene decrease with catalyst sulphidization."

[5] "Thus, accumulation of OCP results in greater contribution to the mechanism of propylene formation during propane interaction with the catalyst. This may be due to accumulation of oxidants participating in formation of propylene from propane."

[6] "It is known that elementary sulphur (refs. 10,11) can selectively dehydrogenate hydrocarbons; for this reason the effect of catalyst treatment with sulphur vapours on catalytic activity towards propylene formation has been tested (Fig. 3). The rate of propylene formation over the catalyst treated with sulphur vapours increases considerably."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP):

1. Effectiveness:
- SO2 has been widely studied but generally unsuccessful for propane dehydrogenation.
- Elementary sulfur (S2) shows promise, significantly increasing propylene formation rates when used to treat catalysts.
- H2S is not directly discussed in the text for ODHP.

2. Propylene yield:
- SO2 alone appears to have low propylene yields.
- Catalysts treated with sulfur vapors (S2) show considerably increased propylene formation rates.

3. Challenges:
- SO2: Forms multiple byproducts including ethylene, methane, and carbon oxides.
- Catalyst sulphidization can decrease activity and selectivity towards propylene.
- Managing sulfur content on catalyst surfaces is crucial for maintaining activity.

4. Key areas for future research:
- Optimizing oxidative condensation products (OCP) formation on catalyst surfaces.
- Understanding the role of elementary sulfur in propylene formation mechanism.
- Developing catalysts that can maintain high sulfur content without deactivation.
- Exploring synergistic effects between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants.

5. Process optimization:
- Investigating the impact of reaction mixture composition on OCP formation and catalyst activity.
- Studying the effects of different catalyst supports and their interactions with sulfur species.
- Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time) for maximum propylene yield.

While the text provides limited direct comparison with conventional oxidants, it suggests that sulfur-based systems, particularly those involving elementary sulfur, show potential for improving ODHP processes. However, careful catalyst design and process control are necessary to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

比较硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果：

1. 有效性：
- SO2已被广泛研究，但在丙烷脱氢方面通常不成功。
- 元素硫（S2）显示出潜力，当用于处理催化剂时，显著提高丙烯生成速率。
- 文中未直接讨论H2S在ODHP中的应用。

2. 丙烯产率：
- 单独使用SO2似乎丙烯产率较低。
- 经硫蒸气（S2）处理的催化剂显示出丙烯生成速率显著提高。

3. 挑战：
- SO2：形成多种副产品，包括乙烯、甲烷和碳氧化物。
- 催化剂硫化可能降低对丙烯的活性和选择性。
- 管理催化剂表面的硫含量对维持活性至关重要。

4. 未来研究的关键领域：
- 优化催化剂表面氧化缩合产物（OCP）的形成。
- 理解元素硫在丙烯形成机理中的作用。
- 开发能保持高硫含量而不失活的催化剂。
- 探索硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂之间的协同效应。

5. 工艺优化：
- 研究反应混合物组成对OCP形成和催化剂活性的影响。
- 研究不同催化剂载体及其与硫物种相互作用的影响。
- 优化反应条件（温度、接触时间）以获得最大丙烯产率。

虽然文本对与传统氧化剂的直接比较有限，但它表明硫基系统，特别是涉及元素硫的系统，显示出改进ODHP工艺的潜力。然而，需要仔细设计催化剂和控制工艺，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和催化剂失活。
