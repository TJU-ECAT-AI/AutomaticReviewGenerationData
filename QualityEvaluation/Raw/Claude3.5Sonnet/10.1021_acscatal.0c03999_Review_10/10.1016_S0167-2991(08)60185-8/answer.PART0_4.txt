[1] "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

[2] "Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts."

[3] "Thus, the active catalyst for selective propane oxidation with SO2 is an oxidative condensation product occuring on the mineral substrate. The formation of surface Pb, Bi or Fe sulphides is unfavourable for the reaction."

[4] "Independent of treatment conditions, only one state of sulphur corresponding to So elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA"

[5] "Taking into account the observed composition of reaction products and rate dependence, the scheme for propylene formation can be presented as follows:
1. SO2 + Z → ZS + ZO
2. ZS + RCH2 → R + SH2Z 
3. SH2Z + ZO → ZS + H2O + Z
4. ZS ⇌ Z + S"

The literature provides limited information on comparing different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, based on the available information:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 is the main sulfur-based oxidant discussed in the literature for ODHP. The study indicates that previous attempts to dehydrogenate propane using SO2 have been unsuccessful. However, the researchers in this study were able to achieve some success using SO2 as an oxidant.

2. Propylene yield: The exact propylene yield is not provided, but propylene is mentioned as one of the main products during propane oxidation using SO2.

3. Challenges: 
   - Byproduct formation: The study mentions the formation of ethylene, methane, carbon oxides, and sulfur oxides as byproducts.
   - Catalyst deactivation: The formation of surface Pb, Bi, or Fe sulfides is noted as unfavorable for the reaction.

4. Key areas for future research:
   - Catalyst design: The study emphasizes the importance of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on the mineral substrate as the active catalyst. Future research could focus on optimizing these OCPs.
   - Reaction mechanism: The proposed reaction scheme involving elementary sulfur (S0) could be a focus for further investigation and optimization.

5. Comparison with other sulfur-based oxidants: The study does not provide direct comparisons with H2S or S2. However, it mentions that elementary sulfur (S0) plays a role in the reaction mechanism, which could be relevant for future comparisons with other sulfur-based oxidants.

6. Process optimization: The study suggests that controlling the formation and composition of OCPs on the catalyst surface could be crucial for improving the ODHP process using SO2 as an oxidant.

In conclusion, while SO2 shows some promise as an oxidant for ODHP, significant challenges remain. Future research should focus on improving catalyst design, understanding the role of elementary sulfur in the reaction mechanism, and comparing the effectiveness of SO2 with other sulfur-based oxidants.

该文献对比较不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果提供了有限的信息。但根据可用信息：

1. 有效性：SO2是文献中讨论的主要硫基氧化剂。研究表明，之前使用SO2脱氢丙烷的尝试都失败了。然而，本研究的研究人员使用SO2作为氧化剂取得了一些成功。

2. 丙烯产率：未提供确切的丙烯产率，但丙烯被提及为使用SO2进行丙烷氧化的主要产物之一。

3. 挑战：
   - 副产物形成：研究提到乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫氧化物作为副产物的形成。
   - 催化剂失活：表面Pb、Bi或Fe硫化物的形成被认为对反应不利。

4. 未来研究的关键领域：
   - 催化剂设计：研究强调矿物基底上的氧化缩合产物(OCP)作为活性催化剂的重要性。未来研究可以集中在优化这些OCPs上。
   - 反应机理：提出的涉及元素硫(S0)的反应方案可能是进一步研究和优化的重点。

5. 与其他硫基氧化剂的比较：研究没有提供与H2S或S2的直接比较。然而，它提到元素硫(S0)在反应机理中起作用，这可能与未来与其他硫基氧化剂的比较相关。
