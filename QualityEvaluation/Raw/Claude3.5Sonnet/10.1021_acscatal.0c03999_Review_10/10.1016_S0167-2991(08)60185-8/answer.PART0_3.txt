[1] "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

[2] "Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts. In the initial period of reaction CS2 and H2S were formed on a number of catalysts."

[3] "Since carbon was the main component of OCP, it was of interest to study catalytic properties of a carbon system. For this purpose carbon was used, and an active and selective catalyst for oxidative propane dehydrogenation was obtained by supporting Fe2O3 on carbon (ref. 8)."

[4] "Independent of treatment conditions, only one state of sulphur corresponding to S0 elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA"

[5] "The data obtained suggest that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O and elementary sulphur are the active species."

The literature provides limited information for a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 appears to be the main sulfur-based oxidant studied for ODHP. Early attempts to use SO2 for propane dehydrogenation were unsuccessful, but later research showed some promise when combined with specific catalysts.

2. Propylene yield: The study doesn't provide specific yield data for different oxidants. However, it mentions that propylene was one of the main products when using SO2 as an oxidant.

3. Challenges: 
   - Byproduct formation: The use of SO2 led to the formation of various byproducts including ethylene, methane, carbon oxides, and sulfur oxides. In some cases, CS2 and H2S were also formed initially.
   - Catalyst deactivation: Some catalysts (Fe, Bi, Pb oxides) showed decreased propane conversion over time, possibly due to sulfidization.

4. Catalyst design: The study found that oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and elementary sulfur were active species for propylene formation. Carbon-based catalysts, especially those supporting Fe2O3, showed promise for ODHP.

5. Key areas for future research:
   - Optimizing catalyst composition to enhance selectivity towards propylene
   - Understanding the role of elementary sulfur in the reaction mechanism
   - Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts under sulfur-rich conditions
   - Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., H2S) for ODHP

The study doesn't provide direct comparisons with conventional oxidants, nor does it discuss H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP. Further research is needed to fully compare the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants and optimize the ODHP process.

该文献为全面比较不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果提供了有限的信息。但是，可以得出一些见解：

1. 有效性：SO2似乎是ODHP研究中主要使用的硫基氧化剂。早期使用SO2进行丙烷脱氢的尝试并不成功，但后来的研究表明，当与特定催化剂结合使用时，SO2显示出一些前景。

2. 丙烯产率：研究没有提供不同氧化剂的具体产率数据。然而，它提到在使用SO2作为氧化剂时，丙烯是主要产物之一。

3. 挑战：
   - 副产物形成：使用SO2导致形成各种副产物，包括乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫氧化物。在某些情况下，初期还形成了CS2和H2S。
   - 催化剂失活：某些催化剂（Fe、Bi、Pb氧化物）随时间推移显示出丙烷转化率下降，可能是由于硫化作用。

4. 催化剂设计：研究发现，含有C、H、O和元素硫的氧化缩合产物（OCP）是形成丙烯的活性物种。基于碳的催化剂，尤其是负载Fe2O3的催化剂，在ODHP中表现出良好前景。

5. 未来研究的关键领域：
   - 优化催化剂组成以提高对丙烯的选择性
   - 理解元素硫在反应机理中的作用
   - 研究催化剂在富硫条件下的长期稳定性
   - 探索其他硫基氧化剂（如H2S）用于ODHP

该研究没有提供与传统氧化剂的直接比较，也没有讨论H2S或S2作为ODHP的氧化剂。需要进一步的研究来全面比较不同硫基氧化剂的有效性并优化ODHP过程。
