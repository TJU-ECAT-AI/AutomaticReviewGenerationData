[1] "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

[2] "Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts. In the initial period of reaction CS2 and H2S were formed on a number of catalysts."

[3] "Since carbon was the main component of OCP, it was of interest to study catalytic properties of a carbon system. For this purpose carbon was used, and an active and selective catalyst for oxidative propane dehydrogenation was obtained by supporting Fe2O3 on carbon (ref. 8)."

[4] "Independent of treatment conditions, only one state of sulphur corresponding to So elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA (see Table 4)."

[5] "The data obtained suggest that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O and elementary sulphur are the active species."

The literature provides limited direct comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants for ODHP, but some insights can be drawn:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 appears to be the main sulfur-based oxidant studied for ODHP. The document mentions that previous attempts to dehydrogenate propane with SO2 have been unsuccessful, suggesting challenges in achieving high propylene yields.

2. Propylene yield: While specific yields are not provided, the study reports propylene as one of the main products when using SO2 as an oxidant. However, the formation of byproducts like ethylene, methane, and carbon oxides indicates that selectivity remains a challenge.

3. Challenges:
   - Byproduct formation: The process produces various undesired products, including ethylene, methane, carbon oxides, and sulfur oxides.
   - Catalyst deactivation: The formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on catalyst surfaces affects their performance over time.
   - Sulfur management: The presence of elemental sulfur on catalyst surfaces and the formation of sulfur-containing byproducts (CS2, H2S) pose challenges for process design and product separation.

4. Key areas for future research:
   - Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that can effectively use SO2 while minimizing byproduct formation and maintaining stability.
   - Understanding the role of sulfur: Further investigating the role of elemental sulfur in the reaction mechanism to optimize its use in catalyst formulations.
   - Process optimization: Exploring ways to manage sulfur-containing species in the reaction system and improve overall process efficiency.

5. Comparison with conventional oxidants: The document doesn't provide a direct comparison with conventional oxidants like O2. However, the use of SO2 appears to introduce unique challenges related to sulfur management that may not be present with conventional oxidants.

In conclusion, while sulfur-based oxidants like SO2 show potential for ODHP, significant research is still needed to overcome challenges related to propylene yield, selectivity, and process design before they can compete with conventional oxidants.

该文献对不同硫基氧化剂和传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的效果没有直接比较，但可以得出一些见解：

1. 有效性：SO2似乎是ODHP研究中主要使用的硫基氧化剂。文献提到，之前使用SO2脱氢丙烷的尝试都未成功，表明在获得高丙烯产率方面存在挑战。

2. 丙烯产率：虽然没有提供具体产率，但研究报告称使用SO2作为氧化剂时，丙烯是主要产物之一。然而，乙烯、甲烷和碳氧化物等副产物的形成表明选择性仍然是一个挑战。

3. 挑战：
   - 副产物形成：该过程产生各种不desired产物，包括乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫氧化物。
   - 催化剂失活：催化剂表面氧化缩合产物(OCP)的形成会随时间影响其性能。
   - 硫管理：催化剂表面存在元素硫以及含硫副产物(CS2、H2S)的形成对工艺设计和产品分离构成挑战。

4. 未来研究的关键领域：
   - 催化剂设计：开发能有效利用SO2同时最小化副产物形成并保持稳定性的催化剂。
   - 理解硫的作用：进一步研究元素硫在反应机理中的作用，以优化其在催化剂配方中的使用。
   - 工艺优化：探索管理反应系统中含硫物质的方法，提高整体工艺效率。

5. 与传统氧化剂的比较：文献没有提供与O2等传统氧化剂的直接比较。然而，使用SO2似乎引入了传统氧化剂可能不存在的与硫管理相关的独特挑战。

总之，虽然SO2等硫基氧化剂在ODHP中显示出潜力，但在丙烯产率、选择性和工艺设计方面仍需进行大量研究以克服挑战，才能与传统氧化剂竞争。
