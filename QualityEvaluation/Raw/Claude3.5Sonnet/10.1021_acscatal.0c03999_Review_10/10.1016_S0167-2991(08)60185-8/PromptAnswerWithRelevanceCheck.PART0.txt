[1] "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

[2] "Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts. In the initial period of reaction CS2 and H2S were formed on a number of catalysts."

[3] "Independent of treatment conditions, only one state of sulphur corresponding to So elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA"

[4] "The data obtained suggest that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O and elementary sulphur are the active species."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides limited direct comparison between different sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants for ODHP. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 has been studied extensively for hydrocarbon oxidation, but attempts to use it for propane dehydrogenation have been unsuccessful. This suggests SO2 may be less effective than conventional oxidants for ODHP.

2. Propylene yield: The study focuses on SO2 as an oxidant, reporting propylene as one of the main products. However, specific yield data is not provided, making it difficult to compare with other oxidants.

3. Challenges:
   - Byproduct formation: The process produces various byproducts including ethylene, methane, carbon oxides, and sulfur oxides. CS2 and H2S were also formed initially with some catalysts.
   - Catalyst deactivation: Some catalysts showed decreasing propane conversion over time, indicating potential deactivation issues.

4. Key areas for future research:
   - Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that maintain activity and selectivity over time, particularly those that resist sulfur poisoning.
   - Understanding the role of sulfur: The study suggests that elementary sulfur in oxidative condensation products plays a role in the catalytic process. Further research into this mechanism could lead to improved catalyst designs.
   - Optimizing reaction conditions: Investigating temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted byproducts.
   - Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants: While this study focused on SO2, comparing its performance with other sulfur compounds like H2S could provide valuable insights.

5. Process optimization:
   - Addressing sulfur management: Developing efficient methods to handle sulfur-containing byproducts and recycle sulfur in the process.
   - Improving selectivity: Finding ways to increase propylene selectivity while reducing the formation of other products like ethylene and methane.

While the study provides some insights into SO2 as an oxidant for ODHP, more comprehensive research comparing various sulfur-based and conventional oxidants is needed to fully assess their relative effectiveness and potential for industrial application.

该文献对不同的硫基氧化剂和传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的直接比较提供的信息有限。但是，我们可以得出一些见解：

1. 有效性：SO2在碳氢化合物氧化方面已经被广泛研究，但用于丙烷脱氢的尝试都失败了。这表明SO2可能不如传统氧化剂在ODHP中有效。

2. 丙烯产率：该研究主要关注SO2作为氧化剂，报告丙烯是主要产物之一。然而，没有提供具体的产率数据，使得难以与其他氧化剂进行比较。

3. 挑战：
   - 副产物形成：该过程产生各种副产物，包括乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫氧化物。在一些催化剂上最初还形成了CS2和H2S。
   - 催化剂失活：一些催化剂随时间推移显示丙烷转化率下降，表明可能存在失活问题。

4. 未来研究的关键领域：
   - 催化剂设计：开发能够长期保持活性和选择性的催化剂，特别是那些能抵抗硫中毒的催化剂。
   - 理解硫的作用：研究表明，氧化缩合产物中的元素硫在催化过程中起作用。对这种机制的进一步研究可能会导致改进的催化剂设计。
   - 优化反应条件：研究温度、压力和反应物比例，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副产物。
   - 探索其他硫基氧化剂：虽然这项研究集中在SO2上，但将其性能与其他硫化合物（如H2S）进行比较可能会提供有价值的见解。

5. 过程优化：
   - 解决硫管理问题：开发有效方法来处理含硫副产物并在过程中循环利用硫。
   - 提高选择性：找到增加丙烯选择性同时减少其他产物（如乙烯和甲烷）形成的方法。

虽然该研究为SO2作为ODHP的氧化剂提供了一些见解，但需要更全面的研究来比较各种硫基和传统氧化剂，以全面评估它们的相对有效性和工业应用潜力。

[1] "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

[2] "Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts."

[3] "For identical reaction mixture compositions, the composition of OCP formed is also similar (Table 2). As the surface of catalysts is packed with OCP, their activities become similar."

[4] "The result obtained is in agreement with (ref. 3) indicating that for Pd/Al2O3 activity and selectivity towards propylene decrease with catalyst sulphidization."

[5] "Thus, accumulation of OCP results in greater contribution to the mechanism of propylene formation during propane interaction with the catalyst. This may be due to accumulation of oxidants participating in formation of propylene from propane."

[6] "It is known that elementary sulphur (refs. 10,11) can selectively dehydrogenate hydrocarbons; for this reason the effect of catalyst treatment with sulphur vapours on catalytic activity towards propylene formation has been tested (Fig. 3). The rate of propylene formation over the catalyst treated with sulphur vapours increases considerably."

Comparing sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP):

1. Effectiveness:
- SO2 has been widely studied but generally unsuccessful for propane dehydrogenation.
- Elementary sulfur (S2) shows promise, significantly increasing propylene formation rates when used to treat catalysts.
- H2S is not directly discussed in the text for ODHP.

2. Propylene yield:
- SO2 alone appears to have low propylene yields.
- Catalysts treated with sulfur vapors (S2) show considerably increased propylene formation rates.

3. Challenges:
- SO2: Forms multiple byproducts including ethylene, methane, and carbon oxides.
- Catalyst sulphidization can decrease activity and selectivity towards propylene.
- Managing sulfur content on catalyst surfaces is crucial for maintaining activity.

4. Key areas for future research:
- Optimizing oxidative condensation products (OCP) formation on catalyst surfaces.
- Understanding the role of elementary sulfur in propylene formation mechanism.
- Developing catalysts that can maintain high sulfur content without deactivation.
- Exploring synergistic effects between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants.

5. Process optimization:
- Investigating the impact of reaction mixture composition on OCP formation and catalyst activity.
- Studying the effects of different catalyst supports and their interactions with sulfur species.
- Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time) for maximum propylene yield.

While the text provides limited direct comparison with conventional oxidants, it suggests that sulfur-based systems, particularly those involving elementary sulfur, show potential for improving ODHP processes. However, careful catalyst design and process control are necessary to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

In conclusion, while SO2 shows some promise as an oxidant for ODHP, significant challenges remain. Future research should focus on improving catalyst design, understanding the role of elementary sulfur in the reaction mechanism, and comparing the effectiveness of SO2 with other sulfur-based oxidants.
