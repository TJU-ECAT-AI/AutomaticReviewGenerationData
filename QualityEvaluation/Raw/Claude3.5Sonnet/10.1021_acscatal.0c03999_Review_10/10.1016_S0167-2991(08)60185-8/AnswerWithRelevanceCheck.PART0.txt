          "Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

"Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts. In the initial period of reaction CS2 and H2S were formed on a number of catalysts."

"Independent of treatment conditions, only one state of sulphur corresponding to So elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA"

"The data obtained suggest that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O and elementary sulphur are the active species."

"It is known that elementary sulphur (refs. 10,11) can selectively dehydrogenate hydrocarbons; for this reason the effect of catalyst treatment with sulphur vapours on catalytic activity towards propylene formation has been tested (Fig. 3). The rate of propylene formation over the catalyst treated with sulphur vapours increases considerably."

"Taking into account the observed composition of reaction products and rate dependence, the scheme for propylene formation can be presented as follows:
1. SO2 + Z → ZS + ZO
2. ZS + RCH2 → R + SH2Z 
3. SH2Z + ZO → ZS + H2O + Z
4. ZS ⇌ Z + S"

          Comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (SO2, S2) with conventional oxidants in ODHP:

1. Effectiveness:
- SO2 has been extensively studied but generally unsuccessful for propane dehydrogenation.
- Elementary sulfur (S2) shows promise, significantly increasing propylene formation rates when used to treat catalysts.
- H2S is not directly discussed for ODHP.

2. Propylene yield:
- SO2 alone appears to have low propylene yields.
- Catalysts treated with sulfur vapors (S2) show considerably increased propylene formation rates.

3. Challenges:
- Byproduct formation: SO2 produces various byproducts including ethylene, methane, carbon oxides, and sulfur oxides. CS2 and H2S were also formed initially with some catalysts.
- Catalyst deactivation: Formation of surface sulfides (Pb, Bi, Fe) is unfavorable for the reaction.
- Sulfur management: Presence of elemental sulfur on catalyst surfaces and formation of sulfur-containing byproducts pose challenges for process design and product separation.

4. Key areas for future research:
- Optimizing oxidative condensation products (OCP) formation on catalyst surfaces.
- Understanding the role of elementary sulfur in the propylene formation mechanism.
- Developing catalysts that can maintain high sulfur content without deactivation.
- Exploring synergistic effects between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants.

5. Process optimization:
- Controlling OCP formation and composition on catalyst surfaces.
- Investigating the impact of reaction mixture composition on catalyst activity.
- Studying effects of different catalyst supports and their interactions with sulfur species.
- Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, contact time) for maximum propylene yield.

While the studies provide limited direct comparison with conventional oxidants, they suggest that sulfur-based systems, particularly those involving elementary sulfur, show potential for improving ODHP processes. However, significant research is still needed to overcome challenges related to propylene yield, selectivity, and process design before they can compete with conventional oxidants.

          比较不同硫基氧化剂（SO2、S2）与传统氧化剂在ODHP中的效果：

1. 有效性：
- SO2已被广泛研究，但在丙烷脱氢方面通常不成功。
- 元素硫（S2）显示出潜力，当用于处理催化剂时，显著提高丙烯生成速率。
- 文中未直接讨论H2S在ODHP中的应用。

2. 丙烯产率：
- 单独使用SO2似乎丙烯产率较低。
- 经硫蒸气（S2）处理的催化剂显示出丙烯生成速率显著提高。

3. 挑战：
- 副产物形成：SO2产生各种副产品，包括乙烯、甲烷、碳氧化物和硫氧化物。在一些催化剂上最初还形成了CS2和H2S。
- 催化剂失活：表面硫化物（Pb、Bi、Fe）的形成对反应不利。
- 硫管理：催化剂表面存在元素硫以及含硫副产物的形成对工艺设计和产品分离构成挑战。

4. 未来研究的关键领域：
- 优化催化剂表面氧化缩合产物（OCP）的形成。
- 理解元素硫在丙烯形成机理中的作用。
- 开发能保持高硫含量而不失活的催化剂。
- 探索硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂之间的协同效应。

5. 工艺优化：
- 控制催化剂表面OCP的形成和组成。
- 研究反应混合物组成对催化剂活性的影响。
- 研究不同催化剂载体及其与硫物种相互作用的影响。
- 优化反应条件（温度、接触时间）以获得最大丙烯产率。

虽然这些研究对与传统氧化剂的直接比较有限，但它们表明硫基系统，特别是涉及元素硫的系统，显示出改进ODHP工艺的潜力。然而，在丙烯产率、选择性和工艺设计方面仍需进行大量研究以克服挑战，才能与传统氧化剂竞争。
