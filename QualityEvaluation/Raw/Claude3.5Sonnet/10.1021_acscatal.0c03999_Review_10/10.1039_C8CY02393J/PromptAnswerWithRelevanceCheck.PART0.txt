<questions>

Compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (such as H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, discussing their impact on propylene yield, the specific challenges associated with each oxidant (including byproduct formation), and the key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or the use of different sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2. The document primarily focuses on the effect of adding trace amounts of H2S to the feed during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. It does not discuss ODHP or compare different oxidants.

The literature does not provide information to compare the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants in ODHP, their impact on propylene yield, specific challenges, or key areas for future research in catalyst design and process optimization for ODHP.

To answer this question comprehensively, additional sources focusing specifically on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and the use of various oxidants would be needed.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献不包含有关丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)或使用H2S、S2和SO2等不同含硫氧化剂的信息。该文档主要关注在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢(PDH)过程中向进料中添加微量H2S的影响。它没有讨论ODHP或比较不同的氧化剂。

该文献没有提供比较含硫氧化剂与传统氧化剂在ODHP中的有效性、它们对丙烯产率的影响、特定挑战或ODHP催化剂设计和工艺优化未来研究的关键领域的信息。

要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的专门关注丙烷氧化脱氢和各种氧化剂使用的资料。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or the use of different sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 for this process. The document focuses on the effect of adding trace amounts of H2S to the feed for regular (non-oxidative) propane dehydrogenation over a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. It does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation or compare different oxidants. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的科学文献不包含任何关于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)或使用不同硫基氧化剂(如H2S、S2和SO2)进行该过程的信息。该文档主要关注在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上进行常规(非氧化性)丙烷脱氢时,向原料中添加微量H2S的效果。它没有讨论氧化脱氢或比较不同的氧化剂。因此,无法根据给定文献中提供的信息直接回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This document does not contain information comparing different sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2 and SO2 with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The paper focuses specifically on the effect of H2S addition on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, not on oxidative dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other sulfur-based oxidants or compare them to conventional oxidants for ODHP. The paper examines how trace amounts of H2S in the feed affect catalyst performance, selectivity and stability for non-oxidative PDH, rather than comparing different oxidants for ODHP. Therefore, the question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

该文档不包含比较不同的硫基氧化剂(如H2S、S2和SO2)与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的效果的信息。该论文专门研究了H2S添加对使用Pt/Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷脱氢(PDH)的影响,而不是氧化脱氢。它没有讨论其他硫基氧化剂或将它们与ODHP的传统氧化剂进行比较。该论文研究了进料中微量H2S如何影响非氧化PDH的催化剂性能、选择性和稳定性,而不是比较ODHP的不同氧化剂。因此,无法根据本文档提供的信息直接回答该问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or the use of different sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, and SO2 for this process. The document focuses on the effect of H2S addition on platinum-catalyzed propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a different process from ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for ODHP based on the information given in this literature.
