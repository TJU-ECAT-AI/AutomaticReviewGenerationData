Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy as a pivotal technique for evidencing unprecedented mechanistic insights by isomer-selective radical detection within complex hydrocarbon-functionalization reaction networks, such as those of catalyzed propane oxychlorination and oxybromination. In particular, while the oxychlorination is surface-confined, we show that in oxybromination alkane activation follows a gas-phase reaction mechanism with evolved bromine and bromine radicals, favoring 2-propyl over 1-propyl radical formation, as evidenced by isomer-selective threshold photoelectron analysis. Furthermore, we provide new mechanistic insights into the cracking and coking pathways that are observed in oxybromination. The first entails propargyl radical formation from consecutive hydrogen abstraction of propyl radicals, ultimately yielding benzene. The second originates from C–C bond cleavage in propane to ethyl and methyl radicals, which produce CH4 and C2H4, or undergo chain-growth reactions, forming C4–C6 species.

Novel processes enabling the selective activation of C–H bonds in light alkanes are of fundamental importance to allow the utilization of natural gas as key energy vector in the transition between the oil and the renewables era. (1−7) Still, this pivotal achievement is hindered by our lack of understanding of mechanisms that control the heterogeneously catalyzed reactions of these hydrocarbons, which is critical for providing design criteria for efficient and stable catalysts. (3−8) In addition, the level of complexity in the case of light alkanes functionalization is further increased by the possibility of gas-phase reactions, in which highly reactive radical species and/or radical initiators can be liberated from the surface or generated above it to form desired and/or undesired products. (8−14) Therefore, operando spectroscopic techniques, which allow to derive mechanistic and/or structural insights at relevant conditions for catalytic operations by combining in situ spectrometry and online catalytic measurements, (15,16) need to be developed over model reactions. Recently, operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy provided strong evidence of radical-based pathways in the oxychlorination and oxybromination of methane and ethane. (12−14) Still, the addition of one carbon atom to the alkane substrate brings a significantly higher level of complexity in the reaction network, due to the formation of different isomers and the much more pronounced side reactions, as combustion, cracking, and coking (Scheme 1). (17−19) Furthermore, C3 radicals can be resonantly stabilized, as opposed to C1 and C2 species, which significantly enhances their lifetime, rendering them ideal precursors in coke formation. (20,21) Therefore, if operando spectroscopies were developed to unravel the mechanism of selective as well as unselective pathways, such as those of cracking and coking that are common in alkane functionalization routes, this would enable the design of optimal catalysts for efficient hydrocarbon activation processes.

Scheme 1. Simplified Reaction Network in Propane Oxyhalogenation, Involving Consecutive Halogenation (Green Arrows), Dehydrohalogenation (Light Blue Arrows), Oxidation (Red Arrows), and Decomposition (Black Arrows) Reactions
Accordingly, propane oxyhalogenation, which is the reaction of C3H8 with HX (X = Cl, Br) and O2 (Scheme 1), was studied in this work via operando PEPICO over the best-performing propane oxychlorination catalyst: chromium(III) phosphate (CrPO4). (18) In-depth kinetic analyses, in agreement with literature observations, (17−19) suggested that propane activation into propyl halide likely occurs in the gas phase in oxybromination with in situ generated bromine species, while in oxychlorination it proceeds via a surface-driven reaction (Figures S1–S3). Therefore, to address the role of gas-phase pathways in propane oxyhalogenation, operando PEPICO spectroscopy was conducted over CrPO4. The detection of radicals during reaction conditions is enabled by the particular configuration of the PEPICO microreactor and of the gas sampling setup (Scheme 2, center). This allows us to minimize the quenching of short-lived reaction intermediates that are desorbed from the catalyst surface or generated in the gas phase above the catalyst by high dilution of the feed and low pressure inside the source chamber (ca. 2 × 10–8 bar) surrounding the reactor outlet (Scheme 2, center). (22−30) In addition, this configuration enables us to conduct the reaction at near-ambient pressures ((1–4) × 10–2 bar), which is orders of magnitude higher than the pressures in archetypical PEPICO experiments and other surface science approaches (down to 10–13 bar), (31,32) where mechanistic insights may be completely different to real-world catalysis. Thus, this is referred to as operando PEPICO. Products, intermediates, and unconverted reactants exiting the reactor form a molecular beam, which passes through a skimmer and is then ionized by monochromatic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation. This results in photoelectrons and photoions that are accelerated by a constant electric field in opposite directions and are detected in delayed coincidence. (22,23) Photoions are analyzed by time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry, which reveals their mass to charge (m:z) ratio, thus indicating the identity of the species (Scheme 2, top). In addition, photoion momentum imaging enables us to distinguish background gas contributions from the molecular beam exiting the reactor, as the latter exhibits high speeds along and low speeds perpendicular to the beam axis. (22) The ionized background gas instead features a room temperature velocity distribution in the x and y directions, resulting in an almost circular spot (Scheme 2, top, inset). Furthermore, photoion momentum imaging allows us to discriminate direct photoionization events from dissociative photoionization ones, where kinetic energy is released broadening the speed distribution perpendicular to the molecular beam axis. Electrons are also velocity map imaged (Scheme 2, bottom, inset) and act as an ionization time stamp for the ion TOF mass analysis. Accordingly, photoionization (PI) and photoion mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE) spectra (Scheme 2, bottom) are derived by integration of all electrons or of those with low kinetic energy ((5–10) × 10–3 eV), respectively. Vibrational fingerprints in the ms-TPE spectra are characteristic of the molecular structure and enable isomer-selective detection by comparison with reference data or Franck–Condon simulations. (33−35) By applying operando PEPICO spectroscopy in propane oxybromination, the presence of Br2 (m:z 158/160/162), bromine (Br•, m:z 79/81), and propyl (C3H7•; m:z 43) radicals was revealed (Figure 1, Figures S4–S9). Although a full quantitative analysis is beyond the scope of this study, due to the lack of experimental photoionization cross sections as well as reliable internal standards, a semiquantitative method was applied. This entailed the integration of signals at the most suited photon energies (Figures S4–S9), which was used in order to determine the relative abundance of reactants, intermediates, and products as a function of reaction parameters, such as temperature and reactants concentration, without incurring dissociative photoionization events. Therefore, the evolution of reactive intermediates as a function of temperature was correlated with that of the reaction products (Figure 1): while the signal of Br2 decreased sharply, signals associated with C3H7• and Br• radicals increased along with that of C3H7Br (m:z 122/124) until ca. 750 K. At higher temperatures, the formation of C3H7Br dropped to zero, while the production of radicals and of C3H6 (m:z 42) increased, which is consistent with a higher rate of dehydrobromination compared to C3H7Br generation (Figure 1 and Figure S6). However, neither Cl2 (m:z 70/72/74) nor chlorine (Cl•; m:z 35/37) radicals were observed in oxychlorination under the investigated conditions (Figure 1 and Figure S4). In addition, C3H7Cl (m:z 78/80) was observed and its signal reached a maximum at ca. 775 K before decreasing sharply with temperature while C3H6 increased. These observations corroborate the occurrence of a consecutive mechanism in which propane is converted into propyl halide, which is then dehydrohalogenated to C3H6, similar to ethane activation via oxyhalogenation. (14) Nevertheless, C3H7• radicals were also observed in oxychlorination, and their production increased with temperature, similarly as in oxybromination (Figure 1, Figures S4 and S6), despite gas-phase contributions being negligible as evidenced by inhibited Cl2 formation in oxychlorination (Figure S1). The presence of C3H7• could be associated with its role as intermediate in a surface-confined reaction, as demonstrated for ethyl radicals in ethane oxychlorination over a FePO4 catalyst. (14) Due to the medium-low operating pressure (2 × 10–2 bar) during operando PEPICO, (22,23) radicals can desorb from the surface and can therefore be spectroscopically detected. Tests conducted with halide-free feeds evidenced the complete absence of C3H7• radicals in both oxychlorination and oxybromination, while their formation correlated with the concentration of inlet halide, indicating their key role in both mechanisms (Figures S5 and S7). Furthermore, allyl (C3H5•; m:z 41) radicals were observed in oxybromination and to a much lesser extent in oxychlorination especially at high temperatures (Figure 1, Figures S4 and S6), which are important intermediates in cracking and coking mechanisms (vide infra). Finally, measurements conducted using an empty reactor evidenced negligible production of radicals or products (Figure 1, Figures S8 and S9).

Scheme 2. Schematic Representation (Middle Panel) of the PEPICO Reactor Setup for Operando Radical Detection Used in This Studya
aThe gases are fed through mass flow controllers (MFC) in a heated SiC reactor coated with CrPO4. The central part of the molecular beam escaping the reactor is photoionized by monochromatic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation, generating ions and electrons. The formers are detected by time-of-flight spectrometry (top panel) and are velocity mapped to distinguish species formed in the reactor from background or from dissociative ionization contributions (inset top panel). Electrons are similarly velocity mapped (inset bottom panel), allowing us to measure photoion mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE; bottom panel) or photoionization (PI) spectra, giving information on the structure of the ions that generated them, thus enabling isomer-selective detection of chemical species. The scope of the depicted mass spectrum in the top panel is solely to illustrate the different reagents, intermediates, and products of propane oxybromination that can be detected by PEPICO spectroscopy.

The blank reactor experiments are shown as reference (open symbols). The left and right panels illustrate the representative mass spectra of reactants, products, and intermediate radical species detected in propane oxychlorination and oxybromination over CrPO4 at 763 and 803 K, respectively. Conditions: C3H8:HX:O2:Ar = 2:2:1:17, FT = 22 cm3 STP min–1, Wcat = 0.05 or 0 g, P = 2 × 10–2 bar. The photon energies at which the signals of each chemical species were recorded in all PEPICO experiments are shown in Figures S4–S9.
Despite proving key mechanistic insights, the detection of radicals, based exclusively on their m:z ratio, does not give any information about their isomeric identity. In order to understand these contributions the ms-TPE spectra were obtained for C3H7• and C3H5• radicals (Figure 2a), which are the most abundant intermediates detected in oxybromination. In particular, the C3H7• ms-TPE spectrum was compared with reference data of 2-C3H7•  (36) and of 1-C3H7• radicals. The latter was obtained by studying the thermal decomposition of 1-butylnitrite (Figure S10), which is described in detail in the Supporting Information. 2-C3H7• was found as the major spectral contributor, while formation of 1-C3H7• was negligible (Figure 2a). Although no distinctive vibrational features were observed in the experimental ms-TPES of m:z 43, owing to the strong change in geometry upon ionization of 2-C3H7• and broad Franck–Condon envelope, (36)Figure 2a strongly evidences that 2-C3H7• is predominantly formed. This regioselectivity is in agreement with the observed favored generation of 2-C3H7Br in oxybromination and gas-phase bromination (Figures S1–S3), as well as with the higher thermodynamic stability of the 2-C3H7• isomer. (37) The ms-TPE spectrum of C3H5• exhibited the CCC bending mode (ν7+) progression of the allyl cation, while contributions from the cyclopropyl radical isomer were found to be negligible (Figure 2a). (38,39) In addition, the good agreement with reference data of the C3H7• and of C3H5• ms-TPE spectra confirmed that both species originate solely from direct photoionization events and are, thus, intrinsic intermediates of the oxyhalogenation chemistry. This was further corroborated by photoion momentum imaging (Figure 2b). The latter showed a narrow velocity distribution perpendicular to the beam axis for both C3H7• and C3H5• radicals, which excluded that these ions stem from dissociative photoionization of any reactant, intermediate, or product (Figure 2b).

The colored lines in panel (a) denote reference ms-TPE spectra of different isomers of the C3H7• and the C3H5• radicals, whose structures are indicated as insets. The ms-TPE spectrum of 1-C3H7• radicals has been obtained by studying the thermal decomposition of 1-butyl nitrite as described in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). Conditions: C3H8:HBr:O2:Ar = 2:2:1:17, FT = 22 cm3 STP min–1, Wcat = 0.05 g, T = 943 K, P = 2 × 10–2 bar.
Analysis of photoions and photoelectrons by PEPICO spectroscopy has provided strong mechanistic insights into catalytic propane oxyhalogenation. Still, the complete reaction network, especially in the case of oxybromination, involves different side reactions, including cracking and coking, as observed in the steady-state experiments (Figure S1). In order to elucidate the mechanism of these pathways, further mass and photoionization spectra were obtained in propane oxybromination. Besides C3H7• and C3H5• species, propargyl (C3H3•, m:z 39) radicals were observed at high temperatures (Figure 3a and Figure S6), which are known precursors of benzene and of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). (39−41) Due to the large abundance of Br• radicals, it is likely that propylene, formed via C3H7Br dehydrobromination, undergoes multiple hydrogen abstractions reactions, yielding C3H5• and C3H3• species (Figure 3a). This was corroborated by a shift in the on-set temperature of C3H5• and C3H3• radicals as compared to 2-C3H7• formation (Figure 3b), in line with a consecutive hydrogen abstraction mechanism. Once formed, two C3H3• radicals can recombine to form 1,5-hexadiyne (C6H6; m:z 78), which can ring-close to generate fulvene (C6H6; m:z 78) and/or benzene (C6H6; m:z 78) (Figure 3c), in agreement with literature observations. (20) Accordingly, the PI spectrum of m:z 78 matched the combination of both fulvene and benzene (Figure 3c), which are the first building blocks in the formation of coke. (30,42,43) Still, detailed mass spectra analysis of the m:z 78 at 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 eV suggested that benzene is the most likely isomer of C6H6+ ions formed during oxybromination (Figure S11), since only small signals were observed at hν ≤ 9.24 eV, which is the reported ionization energy for benzene. (44) To further understand the role of C3H3• radicals in the oxybromination reaction network, the feed of propane, HBr, and O2 was stopped at 943 K and only Ar was let in the reactor, while the signal of C3H3• was followed and the temperature increased (Figure S12). A sudden drop was observed after ca. 950 K, suggesting that C3H3• is inherent to the oxybromination chemistry. Upon further rising of the temperature, its signal increased until reaching a maximum at ca. 975 K, which was followed by a drop in signal of almost an order of magnitude (Figure S12). This is likely due to its desorption from coke deposits over the surface of the catalyst, which further corroborates its critical role in the coking mechanism.

The graph in panel (c) shows the PI and reference spectra of detected m:z 78 ions, while represents ring-closure reactions. Conditions: C3H8:HBr:O2:Ar = 2:2:1:17, FT = 22 cm3 STP min–1, Wcat = 0.05 g, T = 943 K, P = 2 × 10–2 bar.
Cracking products represent other important byproducts in the oxyhalogenation reaction network, which are believed to originate from C–C bond cleavage in the alkane rather than in alkyl halides as observed in previous kinetic analyses. (18,19) Accordingly, propane would split into methyl (CH3•; m:z 15) and ethyl (C2H5•; m:z 29) radicals, which were indeed observed in oxybromination (Figure 4a,b). The occurrence of C2H5• was further supported by ms-TPES analysis of m:z 29, in agreement with reference spectra, (45) as well as by velocity map images at 8.6 eV, evidencing its direct photoionization (Figure S13). Still, at energies ≥10.5 eV contributions to the m:z 29 also originate from dissociative photoionization events, as evidenced by the kinetic energy release that broadens the velocity distribution (Figure S13). These results show that velocity map imaging is a valuable analytical method to understand reaction mechanisms. In general, radicals, including Br• and CH3•, can abstract a hydrogen from C2H5• species, thus forming HBr, CH4, and C2H4, respectively, which were observed in both operando PEPICO and in steady-state experiments (Figure 4a,b, Figure S1). Alternatively, CH3• can undergo chain-growth reactions with other radicals and/or unsaturated hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture, generating C4 to C6 species, as detected by mass and PI spectra (Figure 4a,b), and thus further contribute to the formation of coke precursors. This is exemplified for the case of abundant C3H5• radicals that, upon reaction with CH3•, can form butadiene (C4H6; m:z 54) (Figure 4b) after dehydrogenation. Further CH3• addition together with hydrogen abstraction by Br• can yield 1,3-pentadiene (C5H8, m:z 68), which can ring-close after hydrogen abstraction to form 1,3-cyclopentadiene (C5H6, m:z 66), as observed by PI spectra analysis (Figure 4b). Due to the intrinsically unselective nature of radical-based pathways, hydrogen abstraction and chain-growth reactions by Br• and CH3• radicals can generate a multitude of byproducts, such as methyl cyclopentadiene (C6H8, m:z 80), and cyclohexadienes (C6H8, m:z 80), which have also been detected (Figure 4b). The presence of these species was confirmed by PI spectra analysis of m:z 54, 66, 68, and 80 ions (Figure 4b), in comparison with reference spectra. (30,46−49) We speculate that C5H6 can undergo hydrogen abstraction in the presence of Br• to form cyclopentadienyl (C5H5•, m:z 65) radicals that can dimerize, dehydrogenate, and rearrange to generate PAH compounds such as naphthalene (C10H8; m:z 128), following literature mechanisms. (21) However, these species were not observed during operando PEPICO, likely due to the very low concentration of C5Hn species or to strong adsorption over the catalyst, requiring higher temperature for desorption, as observed in the reagent-free experiments (vide supraFigure S12).

Conditions: C3H8:HBr:O2:Ar = 2:2:1:17, FT = 22 cm3 STP min–1, Wcat = 0.05 g, T = 943 K, P = 2 × 10–2 bar.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated operando PEPICO spectroscopy as a highly valuable technique to unravel detailed mechanistic insights within complex hydrocarbon-functionalization reaction networks, such as those of propane oxychlorination and oxybromination, which were studied over a chromium(III) phosphate catalyst. In particular, this technique enabled us to show that while both reactions proceed via propyl halide generation and its consecutive dehydrohalogenation to propylene, propane activation is catalytic in oxychlorination, which instead occurs in the gas phase in oxybromination with evolved bromine and bromine radicals, promoting side reactions such as cracking and coking. Furthermore, we have shown that operando PEPICO enables isomer-selective radical detection during oxybromination by ms-TPE and PI spectral analyses, revealing that the formation of 2-propyl radicals is preferred in the latter reaction in accordance with the proposed gas-phase alkane activation pathway. Finally, this technique provided insights into coking and cracking mechanisms during oxybromination. The first pathway proceeds via consecutive hydrogen abstraction of 2-propyl by Br• radicals to yield allyl and propargyl species, which lead to the formation of cyclic hydrocarbons, such as fulvene and especially benzene, which are known precursors of PAHs and coke. Cracking products instead are believed to originate from C–C bond cleavage in propane, leading to ethyl and methyl radicals. The former can dehydrogenate to form ethylene, while methyl radicals are likely responsible for chain-growth reactions to yield C4 to C6 species, thus contributing to the formation of coke precursors.

Scheme 2
Scheme 2. Schematic Representation (Middle Panel) of the PEPICO Reactor Setup for Operando Radical Detection Used in This Studya
aThe gases are fed through mass flow controllers (MFC) in a heated SiC reactor coated with CrPO4. The central part of the molecular beam escaping the reactor is photoionized by monochromatic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation, generating ions and electrons. The formers are detected by time-of-flight spectrometry (top panel) and are velocity mapped to distinguish species formed in the reactor from background or from dissociative ionization contributions (inset top panel). Electrons are similarly velocity mapped (inset bottom panel), allowing us to measure photoion mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE; bottom panel) or photoionization (PI) spectra, giving information on the structure of the ions that generated them, thus enabling isomer-selective detection of chemical species. The scope of the depicted mass spectrum in the top panel is solely to illustrate the different reagents, intermediates, and products of propane oxybromination that can be detected by PEPICO spectroscopy.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Extracted peak areas (middle panel), corresponding to molecular halogen, propyl radical, propyl halide, propylene, and halogen radical as a function of temperature in the oxychlorination and oxybromination of propane over CrPO4 as determined in operando PEPICO. The blank reactor experiments are shown as reference (open symbols). The left and right panels illustrate the representative mass spectra of reactants, products, and intermediate radical species detected in propane oxychlorination and oxybromination over CrPO4 at 763 and 803 K, respectively. Conditions: C3H8:HX:O2:Ar = 2:2:1:17, FT = 22 cm3 STP min–1, Wcat = 0.05 or 0 g, P = 2 × 10–2 bar. The photon energies at which the signals of each chemical species were recorded in all PEPICO experiments are shown in Figures S4–S9.

Figure 2. (a) Photoion mass-selected threshold photoelectron (ms-TPE; symbols) spectra and (b) velocity map images of the C3H7• and the C3H5• radicals detected in the oxybromination of propane (POB) over CrPO4 as determined in operando PEPICO. The colored lines in panel (a) denote reference ms-TPE spectra of different isomers of the C3H7• and the C3H5• radicals, whose structures are indicated as insets. The ms-TPE spectrum of 1-C3H7• radicals has been obtained by studying the thermal decomposition of 1-butyl nitrite as described in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). Conditions: C3H8:HBr:O2:Ar = 2:2:1:17, FT = 22 cm3 STP min–1, Wcat = 0.05 g, T = 943 K, P = 2 × 10–2 bar.
