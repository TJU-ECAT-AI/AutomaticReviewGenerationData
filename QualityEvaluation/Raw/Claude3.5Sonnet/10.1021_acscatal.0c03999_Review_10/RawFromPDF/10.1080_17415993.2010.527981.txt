The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene. In summary,
it has been found that ethylene can be produced in high yield (ca 75%) by the oxidation of ethane with
excess sulfur in the 800–850 ◦C temperature range using a residence time of about 1 s. It is surmised that
the high ethylene yield arises from the relatively weak C–S bond which precludes the formation of carbon–
sulfur compounds so favoring pathways to ethylene. A process scheme is suggested which incorporates
ethylene production into sulfur recovery, plants for which are found in essentially all reﬁneries and in
sour gas processing. A potential advantage of this chemistry over standard ethane steam cracking is that
the sulfur process considerably increases carbon efﬁciency for ethylene production as most of the energy
required for ethylene synthesis is supplied by the oxidation of H2S.

Introduction
Most of the world’s ethylene arises from steam cracking of ethane and more complex hydrocar-
bon mixtures, although it can also be recovered from off-gases from reﬁnery catalytic cracking
and coking units. State-of-the-art steam-cracking plants can achieve moderate ethylene yield (ca
65%) from ethane with by-product combustion supplying some of the heat needed to support the
endothermic cracking processes (1). Nevertheless, over the last decade or so, new methods have
been sought for selective and thermally efﬁcient ethylene production. In particular, the research
conducted by Schmidt and co-workers (2–10), among many studies, has investigated the chem-
istry and technology for production of ethylene by catalytic partial oxidation of ethane and other
hydrocarbons.
The extensive research of Schmidt and co-workers has shown that yields of ethylene, equivalent
or better than those obtained by conventional steam cracking, can be realized by passing O2 and
ethane over a Pt-based catalyst. Analysis of numerous data sets from the studies on this reaction
suggest (11) that ethylene is formed, in the main, by catalytic oxidation of part of the ethane
to CO2, CO and H2O at the Pt surface with the heat of reaction of these processes promoting
the thermal conversion of the remaining ethane to ethylene and H2 via gas-phase, radical-based

chemistry. Direct conversion of ethane to ethylene via surface species also plays a role in the high
selectivity to ethylene (11). To date, this type of process has not been commercialized, perhaps
a consequence of the complexity of mixing ethane and pure oxygen safely on a large scale and
because of the high cost of producing O2 from air.
Research in our laboratories has examined the use of S2 in place of O2. Sulfur is a primary
product of the thermal stage of the modiﬁed Claus sulfur recovery process, a standard unit found
in all reﬁneries processing sulfur-containing crude oils (12). In addition to being a vital technology
in an oil reﬁnery, the furnace of the Claus plant is equivalent to an air separation plant operating at
1200 ◦C because S2, formed by the reaction of H2S with O2 in the furnace, is a chemical equivalent
to O2. A brief explanation of the Claus process will be helpful in explaining the relevance of the
research described in the body of this paper.
In a reﬁnery, H2S, recovered from hydrotreater off-gases, is fed to a furnace where partial
oxidation converts ca 65% of the H2S to S2, which on condensation yields liquid sulfur (S8) at ca
140 ◦C. The combustion, in most cases, is supported by air resulting in a furnace temperature of
approximately 1200 ◦C, the actual temperature being dependent on the partial pressure of the H2S
in the feed acid gas which may also contain CO2 and H2O. The other products of partial oxidation
are H2O and SO2which pass from the waste heat boiler and furnace sulfur condenser, along with
unreacted H2S and N2, to a series of catalytic converters which yield further elemental sulfur.
The primary condensation of sulfur from the combustion stage then acts as the air separation
equivalent. As is illustrated in Figure 1, the heat produced in the Claus furnace is recovered as
steam, but in a sulfur-based process for ethylene, the heat produced in a parallel Claus-type furnace
that is reprocessing the H2S formed during ethylene formation would be harnessed to convert the
condensed liquid sulfur to S2 for reaction with ethane (Figure 1). The H2S and SO2 produced in
the dedicated furnace would be combined with the gases entering the Claus catalytic converter
train in order to maintain high S recovery.
Experimental studies reported here show that ethylene can be obtained in 75–79% yield by
contacting ethane with S2 at 800–850 ◦C with reformation of H2S and co-production of a small
amount of CS2, a solvent used in Rayon production. If there is no outlet for CS2, it would be
recycled with the H2S to the ethylene furnace for reconversion to sulfur (Figure 1). The scale of
such an ethylene plant is coupled to the turnover of H2S and CS2 through the dedicated furnace
as it provides the thermal energy to drive the conversion of ethane to ethylene. Importantly, it is

evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S
to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2. The thermo-chemical data of the overall
processes illustrate the favorable energy balance for an ethylene plant based on this chemistry.

Clearly, excess heat energy is produced from H2S oxidation for the conversion, although it should
also be noted that pre-heat of the ethane and sulfur feeds will also be required, with heat recovery
fromtheproductstreamnecessarytomaintainheatbalancefortheoverallprocess(heatexchangers
are not shown in Figure 1). Important industrial aspects of the process are that there are no technical
limitations in mixing sulfur vapor with ethane and the technology required for the reactors would
be equivalent to those used in a Claus furnace. This paper presents data which underpin the
ethylene process illustrated in Figure 1 and discusses the thermal efﬁciency and carbon balance
associated with sulfur-assisted partial oxidation of ethane to ethylene.

Previous studies and background to the experimental design
Little work has been conducted on the conversion of ethane to ethylene by sulfur and only one
study reports some success. Garwood et al. (13) reported that CS2 was the major carbon-containing
product when ethane was passed over a zeolite catalyst that had been impregnated with sulfur
and they did not detect ethylene. In the 1950s, Morningstar reported ethylene formation in a
study in which ethane was bubbled through a reactor-containing liquid sulfur at temperatures of
600–850 ◦C (14). These authors calculated the ethane/sulfur feed ratio based on the amount of
H2S that was formed in the reaction, although the actual ratio would have been a function of the
mixing patterns occurring in the reactor. Ethylene yields of 50% were reported at 874 ◦C using
an ethane/sulfur ratio of ca 7 and a residence time of 7 s. Morningstar also reported that acetylene
became a major product as the ethane/sulfur feed ratio decreased.
In related work, Pasternak and co-workers at Imperial Oil laboratories in Sarnia, Ontario, passed
ethane with H2S and O2 over a CdS catalyst demonstrating that high yields of ethylene (ca 70%)
could be achieved with in situ formation of sulfur species (15, 16). Despite these high yields,
no attempts have been made to commercialize this type of process, possibly because water co-
product of H2S oxidation leads to formation of CO, COS and CO2 which would complicate the
separation and puriﬁcation of ethylene. Most likely, at the time of the Pasternak (15, 16) study,
there was little incentive to implement a high efﬁciency, low carbon-emission ethylene process.
As an aid to the experimental design, equilibrium calculations were conducted allowing for
the absence or presence of solid carbon as a product (Table 1). These calculations employed an
inlet feed temperature of 600 ◦C and studied the effect of varying the inlet ethane/sulfur ratio.
When carbon is allowed to form, ethylene is predicted in negligible quantities and carbon, H2
and CH4 are the only products of note. Data from these calculations will not be analyzed further
as laboratory studies show that, although some carbon-based products are formed, the quantities
produced are much less than predicted. The equilibrium calculations excluding carbon formation
(Table 2) show that ethylene is predicted to form to almost 25% at an ethane–sulfur ratio of
8:1. CH4, CS2 and propylene were also formed in signiﬁcant quantities with CH4 predicted
as, by far, the largest carbon-containing product. At lower ethane–sulfur ratios, less ethylene
and propylene are expected at equilibrium with CS2 becoming a major product. Overall, these
calculations suggest that high ethane/sulfur ratios should favor ethylene production, although only
in moderate equilibrium yield, with CH4 as the dominant carbon-containing product.

Ethane–sulfur reactions
Table 3 summarizes the data obtained from the reaction of ethane with sulfur at 800 ◦C and 850 ◦C
over selected residence times and a ethane–sulfur feed ratio of approximately 4:1 (note that it was
difﬁcult to control the sulfur feed rate precisely with the liquid sulfur delivery system (LSDS) so
the feed ratios were not exactly the same for each experiment). C and S2 product quantities were
calculated from mass balance equations with [C] representing any non-gaseous carbon-containing
species reported in the tables. Despite attempts to detect other carbon-containing species, the
only volatile products that were observed were propylene and thiophene albeit in only very small
quantities (<0.01 mole%). The isolation of dark-colored sulfur, in experiments which gave high
yields of [C], suggests that carbon was present in the liquid sulfur, most likely as complex C–S
polymeric species, usually referred to as carsul. The sulfur referred to here is unconsumed reagent
sulfur (Table 3).
The ﬁrst point to note from the data sets shown in Table 3 is that the ethane–sulfur system
operates under kinetic control at the limited residence times used in this study as very high

ethylene yields (77.3–79.6%) could be obtained at 800 ◦C and 850 ◦C. In addition, as can be
seen by comparison with the reference experiments without sulfur, ethylene yields signiﬁcantly
exceeded those obtained for thermal and O2-promoted conditions (Table 4).
For experiments at 800 ◦C, it was observed that selectivity to and yield of ethylene increased
as the residence time was reduced from 3.0 to 1.2 s at a feed ethane/sulfur ratio of 4.59, 4.41
and 5.29, respectively. The highest yield of ethylene obtained at 800 ◦C (77.3%) was observed
using a 1.2 s residence time which, in terms of carbon efﬁciency, can be explained by the
lower production of CH4, CS2 and [C]. Indeed, based on these observations, it is concluded
that ethylene formation occurs rapidly with further reaction of the product ethylene yielding
methane, more complex carbon products [C] and CS2 at longer contact times. H2 and H2S
were the other major products formed in an approximate 1:0.5 molar ratio with respect to the
amount of ethylene produced. At 850 ◦C, a signiﬁcantly lower yield of ethylene was obtained
using a 1.2 s residence time (70.8% compared with 77.4% at 800 ◦C), the lower yield result-
ing from, most probably, the decomposition of hydrocarbon species to carsul-type products
(Table 3).
As was the case for the experiments at 800 ◦C, reference experiments at 850 ◦C which examined
either thermal cracking of ethane or the O2-assisted partial oxidation resulted in lower ethylene
yields (66.7% and 62.5%, respectively, Table 4) in comparison to when sulfur was present (70.8%,
Table 3). Note, however, that the reference experiments were conducted using a 0.5 s residence
time compared with 1.2 s for the sulfur-promoted reaction. Although not presented in detail here,
reference experiments using 1.2 s resulted in very low ethylene yields (<50%) and large amounts
of carbon-based products which made running such experiments very difﬁcult because of plugging
of the reactor. Clearly, the use of sulfur, at either temperature, inhibited the formation of polymeric
products [C], thus enhancing the conversion of ethane to ethylene. An observation of signiﬁcant
mechanistic interest is that while sulfur was essentially reacted to extinction at 800 ◦C with the
formation of H2S and CS2, at 850 ◦C, lesser amounts of these products were observed along
with some residual sulfur with considerably more H2 per mole of ethane. This result prompted
investigation of higher ethane–sulfur ratio conditions.
3.2.
Effect of ethane–sulfur ratio
In an attempt to probe the mechanism of sulfur-assisted ethylene production from ethane, a series
of experiments was conducted in which the temperature and residence time were held constant
(850 ◦C and 0.6 s) and in which the ethane/sulfur ratio was varied from 8.4, 12.6 to 17.1 (Table 5).
Because of difﬁculties in easily changing the liquid sulfur delivery via the LSDS, these ratio
changes were accomplished by changing the ethane ﬂow and decreasing the inert nitrogen ﬂow.
One interesting observation from these experiments was that a very high ethylene yield (79.6%)
and high selectivity (90.3%) to ethylene was observed at the 8.4 ethane/sulfur feed ratio together
with low selectivity to carbon-based products (0.9%). Ethylene yields decreased progressively at
the higher feed ratios (73.3% and 69.7% at 12.5 and 17.1, respectively) with higher conversions
to methane and [C]. Thus, it can be concluded that sulfur species and, possibly, H2S play a
signiﬁcant role in curtailing cracking-type reactions. Two experiments that included H2S in the
feed (Table 5, at ethane–sulfur feed ratios of 8.5 and 12.8) resulted in ethylene yields of 74.3%
and 74.7%, respectively, and low selectivity to [C] products (1.1%).
Overall, it can be concluded that adjustment of the balance of ethane/sulfur feed ratio, residence
time and reaction temperature would allow engineering of a process yielding around 75% of ethy-
lene with minimal conversion to solid carbon products. The hydrogen and methane by-products
could be used in generating heat and utilities for the plant or burnt within the ethylene furnace to
maintain heat balance.

Reaction pathways
Although surface reactions cannot be ruled out when using small reactors, most probably, the
quartz reactors used in this study had little inﬂuence on the reaction chemistry. Thus, the following
discussion will focus on gas-phase reaction pathways. The reactions suggested in Scheme 1 are
but a brief summary of the numerous steps that could be written for the sulfur–ethane system and
those shown have been chosen to illustrate pathways toward the major products. These pathways
should not be viewed as deﬁnitive mechanistic information. The stable sulfur allotrope at 800–
850 ◦C is S2, a species containing two unpaired electrons which, therefore, can initiate a cascade
of radical reactions. In addition to the thermal production of ethylene via the standard C–C bond
homolysis mechanism (not shown), it is probable that oxidation by S2 is a major pathway to
ethylene (Scheme 1). Interestingly, the proposed intermediate [H2S2] can lead either to H2S or
H2 but, in either case, produce sulfur species which initiate further ethylene-producing reactions.
Scheme 1.
Pathways for conversion of ethane to ethylene by S2.
The production of H2S or reformation of S2 is a key difference to ethylene production by
partial oxidation of ethane with O2 because in the oxygen system strong O–H bond formation
precludes any further participation of oxygen species, principally water, in ethylene formation.
Indeed, the production of water limits ethylene yields because ethylene is readily consumed in
steam reforming reactions. Although C–C bond thermolysis could also be invoked to explain the
methane production in this work and could, indeed, be the major pathway to methane in this study,
Scheme 1 illustrates the possibility of a sulfur-mediated pathway to methane via the ethyl radical.
This reaction could also yield a dithiol species that could be oxidized to CS2. In principle, the
production of methane via the ethyl radical should lead to methane and CS2 in equimolar quantities
but the weak C–S bond would result in the preferential formation of carbon species by C–S bond
homolysis that form methane via H-abstraction from H2S or other H-rich species. Indeed, the
488 P.D. Clark et al.
high yields of ethylene observed in this work are, in part, a consequence of the relatively weak
C–S bond as ethyl radicals, even if captured by sulfur radicals, e.g. HS, will readily reform the
ethyl radical or produce ethylene directly by elimination of H2S.
3.4.
Sulfur-mediated ethylene production and carbon efﬁciency
Depending on the process conﬁguration, a typical steam-cracking plant based on ethane results
after ethane recycle in about 75% conversion to ethylene with the remaining carbon ending up
as CO2. In addition, methane is consumed to heat the cracking furnaces, producing further CO2.
Assuming that ethane is recycled in the sulfur process and that an ethylene yield of 75% can
be obtained 80–85% of the ethane is converted to ethylene and no external methane is required,
since heat demand of all process would be supplied from the oxidation of H2S and CS2 with any
energy shortfall being made up by co-ﬁring the by-product H2, CH4 and H2S produced in the
reﬁnery hydrotreating units. Thus, the only CO2 resulting from this process is that which arises
from the product methane and CS2 that is recycled to the ethylene furnace. An important aspect
of the dedicated ethylene furnace is that it must be operated in a similar regime to the main Claus
furnace such that the off-gases can be sent directly to the Claus catalytic converter array. Clark
(12) gives a comprehensive review of the combustion chemistry of sulfur and carbon species in a
Claus-type furnace.

Experimental procedures
4.1.
Materials
Ethane (99.5%) was obtained from Praxair Canada Inc. and elemental sulfur (sublimed, >99.9%)
was supplied by Fischer Scientiﬁc Canada.
Gas chromatographs, used for the determination of the majority products reported in the data
tables, were calibrated with standards obtained from Praxair Canada Inc. and the Scott Specialty
Gases Company. In-house calibration mixtures for SO2 (0.864% in N2) and for CS2 (1.7% in N2)
were prepared using standard procedures.

Procedure: reagent delivery
All experiments were conducted in a quartz reactor positioned horizontally in a furnace (Figure 2),
the temperature of which could be controlled to ±5 ◦C. The internal reactor temperature was
determined by a K-type thermocouple and by various placements of this thermocouple, the “hot
zone” on the reactor was determined in order that inlet feed gas tubes could be positioned at the
beginning of the hot zone. Feed ethane, carrier N2 and other gases were delivered to the reactor
using a Linde FM4575 mass ﬂow control console and Brooks 5850E mass ﬂow control modules
supplied by Advanced Specialty Gas Equipment, and sulfur was supplied via an LSDS illustrated
in Figure 3. Both vapor phase and LSDS were devised for the sulfur feed but only the LSDS
provided accurate sulfur delivery.
The LSDS consisted of a 1 L stainless steel pot with a 3 m capillary tube (i.d. 2.5 mm) coiled
within it and connected to an outlet valve (Figure 3). The outlet tube was connected via a tee-
section to a delivery tube which was heated, insulated and plumbed to the reactor inlet system.
With the pot temperature set at 140 ◦C to avoid the viscous region for liquid sulfur (160–200 ◦C),
N2 overpressure (up to 414 kPa) was used to force liquid into the capillary tube. A relief valve
(Figure 3) allowed for pressure control and as a means of stopping sulfur ﬂow. The outlet capillary

wasconnectedtoatee-section(140–145 ◦C)consistingofa25.4 mm(OD)to6.4 mm(OD)reducer
and a 4 cm long 25.4 mm (OD) tube extension. The capillary outlet entered the tee-section in such
a way as to prevent the liquid sulfur from touching the metal components and for the liquid sulfur
to drop vertically into the delivery tube/mixing line (340–350 ◦C) to vaporize and avoid build
up of viscous liquid sulfur near the top of the system. The LSDS was calibrated at various N2
over-pressures (Figure 4) before each experiment set.

General procedure
The complete system was ﬂushed with N2 and the reactor temperature was raised to the desired
value using a N2 ﬂow rate equivalent to the following feed ﬂow rates.After the reactor temperature
had been attained (ca 1 h), feed gases were introduced and ﬂowed until the product gas composition
had stabilized (ca 15 min). Product samples were obtained via a gas syringe from a capillary tube
inserted at the end of the hot zone using a pump to withdraw the gas. In addition, gas samples

were taken from the sulfur condenser pot and, in both cases, the gas was ﬂowed through a small
cartridge of P2O5 to remove sulfur and water (formed in cases where O2 was used).
4.4.
Gas feed and product analysis
Gas feed and product analyses were conducted on SRI 8610B gas chromatographs equipped with
thermocouple detectors. Hydrocarbons (C1–C3) and sulfur-containing compounds (H2S, SO2,
COS and CS2), as well as CO2 were analyzed on a Poropak QS column using He carrier gas. N2,
O2, CO and H2 were analyzed on a 5A molecular sieve column using Ar carrier gas. Multi-point
Journal of Sulfur Chemistry 491
calibrations of the chromatographs were conducted using the gas standards mentioned previously.
Three or more gas samples were taken at each condition, or until steady-state data were obtained
using a variance of ±5% for the collected data to be deemed representative. This ﬁgure was based
on the error estimation for all procedures used for gas sampling and analysis. In practice, data
variation of less than ±2.5% was achieved.
4.5.
Safety note
A major product, and in some cases a reactant in this study, was H2S, a gas which is lethal at
concentrations of 750–1000 ppmv for a single breath by an adult. All experimental systems were,
therefore, contained in a ventilated area under constant electronic H2S monitoring with a warning
threshold set to 10 ppmv. H2S supply was also contained in a ventilated area and supplied through
an emergency shut down valve system designed to stop gas ﬂow if the 10 ppmv threshold was
reached in either the gas storage or experiment containment areas. Hazardous operations review
of the experimental procedures was also conducted by our research team before the laboratory
study was commenced.

Concluding comments
Results obtained in this study demonstrate that it should be possible to design a commercial
process for the production of ethylene via sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane in high selectivity
(ca 90%) and yield (ca 75%). Importantly, this process produces very little CO2 in comparison
with the conventional steam-cracking technology. The process could be readily integrated in an
oil reﬁnery or into a sour gas processing plant with all off-gases being handled in the Claus sulfur
recovery plant and tail gas treatment systems.
Ethylene formation via sulfur oxidation of ethane is a kinetically controlled process. Mecha-
nistically, it is concluded that high selectivity to ethylene is a consequence of the relatively weak
C–S bond which favors ethylene production pathways over the formation of products such as CS2.
