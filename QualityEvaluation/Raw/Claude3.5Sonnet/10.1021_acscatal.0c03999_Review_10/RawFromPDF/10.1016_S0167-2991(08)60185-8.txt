in a continuous flow reactor at 873-913 K

 Oxidative condensa- 
tion products (OCP) containing C,H,O and S which form during re- 
action overGa,AJ,Si oxides and carbon, were shorn to be active 
towards propylene formation. Sulphidization of Fe,Bi and Pb oxi- 
des in the reaction did not increase the activity. Be shorn 
by 
XPS, OCP contain sulphur in So state 
which participates in the 
limiting reaction step. A scheme of the mechanism of propylene 
formation 
over OCP is proposed.

INTRODUCTION 
Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the sub- 
ject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to de- 
hydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-31. Most compre- 
hensively studied is the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation 
of ethylbenzene to styrene (refs. 4-71.

 have shown that when the reaction occurs over - 
A1203, oxidative condensation products (OCP) 
which contain C,H,S 
and 0 
and selectively accelerate the interaction of ethylbenzene 
with SO2 are deposited on the catalyet surface (refs. 4,5). 
A stu- 
dy of independent interactions of reagents with the catalyst al- 
lowed the authors to propose a concerted mechanism of styrene for- 
mation on OCP with participation of the oxygen of the oxidant 
(refs. 6,7). According to the authors sulphur in OCP is not in- 
volved in the interaction. 
!Chis paper reports the results of studies on the selective 
oxidation of propane over Bi,Pb,Fe,Ga,Si,Al oxides as well as 
carbon and also aome ideas on the reaction mechanism. These com- 
pounds are recommended 88 catalysts and supports for propane de- 
hydrogenation with oxygen in the presence of SO2 and H2S (refs. 
9,101.

steady catalyst bed at atmospheric pressure; 
the gas

was analyzed chromatographically. Reaction 
mix- 
tures containing 
propane, sulphur

and helium were prepar- 
ed in 
preliminarily 
outgassed steel

filling-up 
of the reactor 
only with quartz 
does not lead to any noticeable 
propane oxida- 
tion 
under the experimental 
conditions 
employed. For the stan- 
dard treatment the catalyst 
was aged in 
a 
helium flow for 1 h 
at 
the experimental 
temperature prior to experiments. The selectivi- 
ty towards a 
product (%I was calculated as a 
proportion of this 
product in 
the products registrated 
without taking into account 
the OCP. The catalyst activity was defined as either an observ- 
able propane flow rate or a 
propylene formation 
rate. 
The composition 
and amount of OCP were determined by DTA, 
DTG 
along 
with chemical 
analysis. The phase composition 
of catalysts 
was checked b
y
 X-ray and DTA methods. Concentration

were the main products during propane oxidation 
over the studied

the initial 
period of reaction 
CS2 and H2S were 
formed on a 
number o

For identical reaction mixture compositions, the composition 
of OCP formed is also similar (Table 2
)
.
 As the surface of cata- 
lysts is packed with OCP, their activities become slmilsr. Sul- 
phidimtion of catalysts does not lead to an increase in propy- 
lene formation 
rate. 
Thus, the active catalyst f o r  selective propane oxidation with

Since carbon 
was the main component of OCP, it was of interest 
to study catalytic properties of a carbon system. For this purpose 
carbon was used, and an active and selective catalyst for oxida- 
tive propane dehydrogenation 
was obtained by supporting Fe203 on 
carbon (ref. 8). 
Carbon 
pylene formation is approximately 4 
times higher a
t
 the initial 
moment of time.

 The catalyst 
activity 
w88 characterized 
b
y
 the amo- 
unt o
f
 propylene formed in one propane pulse. As propane passes 
through 
carbon, 
propylene is formed, the amount of which changes 
elightly from pulse to pulse (Fig. 2a). B
y
 further 
passing SO 
and after 
R pulses n
o
 propylene is observed in the reaction 
pro- 
ducts. After 50 SO pulses, 
a

 mol) in- 
crease of propylene formation 
is obeerved during R pulses. This 
indicates 
a 
weak interaction 
of both propane and SO2 with the 
carbon 
surface. At ROS pulse through 
pure carbon 
the amount o
f
 
formed propylene is 
higher compared to R pulse and increases 
from 
pulse to pulse (Fig. 2
b
)
.
 At passing ROS and R pulses in 
turn 
through 
the catalyst the amount of propylene formed in 
R pulses 
increases, 
thus becoming closer 
to that for 
ROS pulses. 
Thus, 
accumulation 
of OCP results in 
greater contribution 
to 
the 
mechanism of propylene formation 
during propane interaction 
with the catalyst. This 
may be due to accumulation 
of oxidants 
participating 
in formation 
of propylene from propane. 
I
t
 is 
known 
that elementary sulphur (refs. 10,ll) can 
selec- 
tively dehydrogenate 
hydrocarbons; 
for this 
reason the effect of 
catalyst treatment with sulphur 
vapours on catalytic activity to- 
wards propylene formation 
has been tested (

f

considerably. In 
all cases, 
treatment of the cata- 
lyst

 increase in

 Halter (Yale University, USA): Could you elaborate on the se- 
condetep of your 
mechanism? Specifically, 
do you intend for this 
step to be elementary or the summary of several steps 
that result 
in 
the reaction 
of 
gas phase propane and adsorbed H S? 
It appears to be too complicated to be an elementars step and 
one might expect H2S to be adsorbed in 
dissociative manner. 
2. Osipova (Institute 
of Catalysis, 
USSR): We do not believe this 
step to be elementary. Certainly, it is a summary of several 
ele- 
mentary steps that result in 
the formation 
of propylene. We have 
no sufficient results now to detail this step. This 
will be the 
subject of our future investigations.

 Baerns ( R u h r  Univ., Bochum, 
BRD): Would you please comment, 
how 
this reaction 
would be applicated from an applied point of view. 
How would you separate S, 
which is obviously a reaction 
product, 
from the catalyst and the reactants?

 Osipova (Institute

can cor- 
roborate that sulphur 
adsorbed on a surface takes part in the re- 
action

3. Regardless of the way we treat a catalyst, 
whether 
with 
fumes of sulphur, 
reaction 
mixture of propane and sulphur 
dioxide, 
or 
with sulphur 
dioxide, XPS Bethod shows that there is one state 
of sulphur correspondent to S 
of propylene formation 
is proportional to the quantity of S on 
a

ace. 
4. No gas-phase reactions: C H 
+ 1/2 S + H20 
under experimental conditions. 
Thus, 
active sulphur 
is sulphur 
stabilized on a surface by the 
oxidative condensation products. The reaction 
product is 
the gas- 
phase sulphur 
which can 
dehydrate propane at 700-740°C (Oil & Gas 
J., 1972, 70, 
No 23, 
62-63), but is not active under conditions 
of our experiments.
