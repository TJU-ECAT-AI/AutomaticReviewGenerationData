<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information about using sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document primarily focuses on conventional catalytic dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation processes using oxygen or carbon dioxide as oxidants. It does not discuss the use of sulfur-based oxidants or their impact on propylene yield, associated challenges, or areas for future research in catalyst design for such processes. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

The literature provided does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their use in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses primarily on conventional catalytic dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation processes using oxygen or carbon dioxide as oxidants. It does not discuss H2S, S2, SO2, or any other sulfur-based oxidants in relation to ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants or discuss their specific impacts, challenges, and areas for future research based on the given information.

The provided literature does not contain any information about using sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses primarily on conventional oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen or carbon dioxide as oxidants, as well as non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Without specific information on sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison or discussion of their effectiveness, challenges, or areas for future research based solely on the given text.

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document primarily focuses on conventional oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen or carbon dioxide as oxidants, as well as non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. There is no comparison or discussion of sulfur-based oxidants for ODHP.

To properly answer this question, additional research would be needed on the specific use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, their effectiveness compared to conventional oxidants, challenges associated with each, impacts on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and areas for future catalyst design and process optimization. This information is not available in the provided literature.

给定的文献中没有包含关于在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯过程中使用H2S、S2和SO2等含硫氧化剂的信息。该文档主要关注使用氧气或二氧化碳作为氧化剂的常规氧化脱氢过程,以及非氧化脱氢过程。文中没有比较或讨论ODHP中含硫氧化剂的使用。

要正确回答这个问题,需要对ODHP中含硫氧化剂的具体使用、它们与传统氧化剂相比的有效性、与每种氧化剂相关的挑战、对丙烯产率的影响、副产物的形成以及未来催化剂设计和工艺优化的关键领域进行额外研究。这些信息在所提供的文献中是没有的。
