Sulfur-based alternative oxidants have emerged as promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in propylene production, offering potential advantages over traditional oxygen-based systems. These novel oxidants demonstrate enhanced selectivity towards propylene formation and reduced coke deposition, addressing some of the longstanding challenges in ODHP processes. However, their implementation faces several hurdles, including the need for efficient sulfur recovery and regeneration systems, potential catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning, and the formation of undesirable sulfur-containing byproducts. Despite these challenges, recent advancements in catalyst design have shown promise in mitigating some of these issues. Researchers are exploring innovative approaches such as developing sulfur-resistant catalysts, optimizing reactor configurations, and fine-tuning reaction conditions to maximize the benefits of sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing their drawbacks. As the field progresses, future directions in catalyst design optimization will likely focus on improving sulfur tolerance, enhancing catalytic activity, and developing more robust materials capable of withstanding the harsh reaction environments associated with sulfur-based ODHP processes.
