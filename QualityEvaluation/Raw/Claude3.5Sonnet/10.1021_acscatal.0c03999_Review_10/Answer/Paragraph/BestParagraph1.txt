The use of sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene has shown promising results compared to conventional oxidants. However, each sulfur-based oxidant presents unique advantages and challenges in terms of propylene yield, selectivity, and process considerations.

H2S as an oxidant:
H2S has demonstrated significant improvements in propylene yield and selectivity. Studies have shown that the addition of H2S to the feed gas can increase propylene selectivity up to 70% with a propane conversion of 28.1% at 700°C [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. The best propylene yield achieved was 30.4% using a V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S at 700°C with a short contact time of 0.005 s [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts has even achieved propylene yields up to 60% at 705°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10].

H2S effectively suppresses the formation of undesired byproducts such as COx, C2H4, and CH4, and improves catalyst performance. For instance, V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst, which was selective for COx formation without H2S, became effective for propylene production when H2S was added to the feed gas [10.1080/17415990412331327909].

S2 as an oxidant:
S2 acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane. It has shown improvements in propylene yield and selectivity, with one study reporting 73% selectivity at 650°C. However, conversion rates remain low (10% at 650°C), and gas-phase reactions tend to dominate over catalytic reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10]. The use of S2 requires high temperatures (1200-1400°F) to form reactive diradical species, which could lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons [10.1002/cjce.5450480221].

SO2 as an oxidant:
SO2 has been extensively studied but has shown mixed results. While it increases propane conversion, it significantly decreases selectivity to propylene. For example, at 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added [10.1002/jctb.5040340407]. The main challenge with SO2 is the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts, resulting in low propylene yields [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10].

Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants:
1. Formation of sulfur-based byproducts (CS2, thiol mercaptans, S8) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10]
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity, especially for SO2
3. High temperature requirements for S2, potentially leading to thermal cracking
4. Catalyst deactivation and coke formation
5. Handling and safety concerns with toxic gases like H2S

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing structure-activity relationships for rational catalyst design [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_10]
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions to enhance selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates
3. Investigating reaction mechanisms to understand the role of sulfur species in ODHP
4. Exploring synergistic effects between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants
5. Addressing environmental concerns related to sulfur-based oxidants
6. Developing in-situ/operando characterization techniques
7. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, contact time) for each sulfur-based oxidant

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, sulfur-based oxidants show significant potential for improving ODHP processes. H2S appears to be the most promising among the sulfur-based oxidants, offering high propylene yields and selectivity. However, each oxidant has its unique advantages and challenges. Future research should focus on developing novel catalysts that can effectively utilize these sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing byproduct formation and addressing safety concerns. Additionally, exploring hybrid systems that combine sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants or other promoters could lead to breakthrough improvements in ODHP technology. The development of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling approaches will be crucial in understanding the complex reaction mechanisms and guiding rational catalyst design. Ultimately, the success of sulfur-based ODHP will depend on achieving a balance between high propylene yields, process efficiency, and environmental sustainability.
