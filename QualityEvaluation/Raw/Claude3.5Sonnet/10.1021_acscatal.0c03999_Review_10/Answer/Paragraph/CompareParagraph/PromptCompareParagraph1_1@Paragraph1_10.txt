The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants has garnered significant attention as an alternative to conventional oxidants. This review focuses on comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in ODHP.

1. Effectiveness and Propylene Yield:

H2S:
- Significantly improves propylene yield and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
- Achieves up to 70% selectivity to propene with 28.1% propane conversion at 700°C [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
- Best propene yield of 30.4% over V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700°C and 0.005s contact time [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
- H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts at 705°C can achieve up to 60% propylene yield [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

S2:
- Acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
- Improves propylene yield and selectivity (73% selectivity at 650°C) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
- However, conversion rates remain low (10% at 650°C) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

SO2:
- Increases overall propane conversion but significantly decreases selectivity to propylene [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
- At 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
- Results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

2. Challenges:

H2S:
- Potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
- Need for optimized reaction conditions [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
- Handling of toxic gas, requiring additional safety measures [10.1080/17415990412331327909].

S2:
- High temperature requirements (1200-1400°F) to form reactive species [10.1002/cjce.5450480221].
- Dominance of gas-phase reactions over catalytic reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
- Formation of sulfur-based byproducts (CS2, thiol mercaptans, S8) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

SO2:
- Significant decrease in propylene selectivity [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
- Formation of undesired byproducts (H2S, H2O, CO2) [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7].
- Catalyst deactivation over time [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].

3. Key Areas for Future Research:

1. Catalyst design:
   - Develop catalysts that maintain high selectivity while using sulfur-based oxidants [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
   - Design catalysts to inhibit byproduct formation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
   - Explore novel catalyst supports and promoters [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

2. Reaction mechanisms:
   - Further investigate the complex effect of sulfur-based oxidants on the dehydrogenation mechanism [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
   - Understand and control gas-phase reactions, especially for S2-based ODHP [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

3. Process optimization:
   - Optimize reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst composition) to balance conversion and selectivity [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
   - Investigate long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under sulfur-rich conditions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

4. Byproduct management:
   - Explore ways to reduce or utilize byproducts, particularly CO2 and H2S [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
   - Develop efficient separation techniques for sulfur-containing byproducts [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7].

5. Comparative studies:
   - Conduct comprehensive research on H2S, S2, and SO2 to compare their effectiveness and challenges with conventional oxidants [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP presents a promising alternative to conventional oxidation methods, with each oxidant offering unique advantages and challenges. H2S shows the most promise, significantly improving propylene yield and selectivity, while S2 acts as a softer oxidant but struggles with low conversion rates. SO2, despite increasing conversion, faces selectivity issues.

Future research should focus on developing tailored catalysts for each sulfur-based oxidant, optimizing reaction conditions, and addressing byproduct formation. A deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of intermediate sulfur species, could lead to breakthrough improvements in catalyst design. Additionally, exploring synergistic effects between different sulfur-based oxidants or combining them with conventional oxidants may open new avenues for process optimization.

The environmental and economic aspects of using sulfur-based oxidants should also be thoroughly evaluated, considering the potential for sulfur recovery and the mitigation of sulfur emissions from other industrial processes. As the chemical industry moves towards more sustainable practices, the integration of sulfur-based ODHP could potentially offer a dual benefit of improved propylene production and sulfur utilization.

Sulfur-based alternative oxidants have emerged as promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in propylene production, offering potential advantages over traditional oxygen-based systems. These novel oxidants demonstrate enhanced selectivity towards propylene formation and reduced coke deposition, addressing some of the longstanding challenges in ODHP processes. However, their implementation faces several hurdles, including the need for efficient sulfur recovery and regeneration systems, potential catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning, and the formation of undesirable sulfur-containing byproducts. Despite these challenges, recent advancements in catalyst design have shown promise in mitigating some of these issues. Researchers are exploring innovative approaches such as developing sulfur-resistant catalysts, optimizing reactor configurations, and fine-tuning reaction conditions to maximize the benefits of sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing their drawbacks. As the field progresses, future directions in catalyst design optimization will likely focus on improving sulfur tolerance, enhancing catalytic activity, and developing more robust materials capable of withstanding the harsh reaction environments associated with sulfur-based ODHP processes.
