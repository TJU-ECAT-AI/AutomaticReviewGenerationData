Impact on propylene yield: Adding trace amounts of sulfur (as H2S) significantly improved propylene yield. Without sulfur, the reaction was not selective for propylene. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene.\n\n2. Specific challenges: \n   - Without sulfur, the main reaction was hydrogenolysis, producing methane and coke as primary products.\n   - The presence of sulfur suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.\n   - The reaction changed from exothermic (hydrogenolysis) to endothermic (dehydrogenation) with sulfur addition.\n\n3. Key areas for future research:\n   - Optimizing sulfur concentration: The study used 25-500 ppm, but further research could fine-tune this range.\n   - Long-term catalyst stability: While the study showed good performance over six 24-hour cycles, longer-term effects need investigation.\n   - Comparison with other sulfur compounds: The study mainly used H2S, but briefly mentioned thiophene. Further research could explore other sulfur compounds.\n   - Mechanism understanding: More research is needed to fully understand how sulfur modifies the catalyst surface and reaction pathways.\n   - Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) for ODHP\n   - Exploring different catalyst compositions to further enhance propylene yield and selectivity\n\nIt's important to note that this study focused on catalytic dehydrogenation rather than oxidative dehydrogenation. For a comprehensive comparison of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, additional research would be necessary.", "Doi": "10.1016/0021-9517(86)90312-X"},
