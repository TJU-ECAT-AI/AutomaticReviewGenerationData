The effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene has been investigated and compared to conventional oxidants. Each sulfur-based oxidant presents unique advantages and challenges in terms of propylene yield, selectivity, and process optimization.

H2S as an oxidant:
H2S has shown promising results in ODHP, demonstrating improved propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation methods. Key findings include:
1. Increased propylene selectivity (up to 70% at 700°C) and reduced unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4) [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
2. Higher propane conversion rates and improved catalyst performance, particularly with V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
3. Best propylene yield achieved was 30.4% at 700°C and 0.005 s contact time [10.1080/17415990412331327909].
4. H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts (LiCl/KCl/MnCl2) at 705°C achieved propylene yields up to 60% [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

S2 as an oxidant:
Elemental sulfur (S2) has shown potential as a milder oxidant compared to oxygen, with the following observations:
1. Acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
2. Improves propylene yield and selectivity (73% selectivity at 650°C) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
3. However, conversion rates remain low (10% at 650°C) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
4. Gas-phase reactions dominate over catalytic reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

SO2 as an oxidant:
SO2 has been extensively studied but faces challenges in maintaining high propylene selectivity:
1. Increases propane conversion but significantly decreases selectivity to propylene [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
2. At 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
3. Results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].

Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants:
1. Formation of sulfur-based byproducts (CS2, thiol mercaptans, S8) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity, especially for SO2 [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
3. High temperature requirements for S2 to form reactive species [10.1002/cjce.5450480221].
4. Catalyst deactivation and coke formation [10.1016/0021-9517(68)90017-1].

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing structure-activity relationships for rational catalyst design [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions for each sulfur-based oxidant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
3. Investigating long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under sulfur-rich conditions [10.1007/BF02071147].
4. Understanding and controlling gas-phase reactions, especially for S2-based ODHP [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
5. Developing catalysts with moderate redox properties to balance alkane activation and overoxidation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
6. Exploring synergistic effects between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants [10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The research on sulfur-based oxidants for ODHP reveals a promising alternative to conventional oxidants, with each sulfur species offering unique advantages and challenges. H2S shows the most promising results in terms of propylene yield and selectivity, while S2 offers potential as a milder oxidant. SO2, despite extensive research, faces significant selectivity issues. Future research should focus on developing tailored catalysts for each sulfur-based oxidant, optimizing reaction conditions, and addressing byproduct formation. The integration of in-situ characterization techniques and computational modeling could provide deeper insights into reaction mechanisms and guide catalyst design. Additionally, exploring hybrid systems combining sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants or other promoters may lead to synergistic effects, potentially overcoming individual limitations. As environmental concerns grow, research into efficient sulfur management and recovery systems will be crucial for the industrial viability of sulfur-based ODHP processes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene using sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) has shown promising results compared to conventional oxidants. However, each sulfur-based oxidant presents unique advantages and challenges in terms of propylene yield, selectivity, and process efficiency.

H2S as an oxidant:
H2S has demonstrated significant improvements in propylene yield and selectivity. Studies have shown that H2S can achieve up to 70% selectivity to propene with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700°C [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. The best propene yield reported was 30.4% using a V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S at 700°C with a short contact time of 0.005 s [10.1080/17415990412331327909]. H2S also suppresses the formation of unwanted byproducts such as COx, C2H4, and CH4 [10.1080/17415990412331327909].

S2 as an oxidant:
Elemental sulfur (S2) acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane. It has shown improvements in propylene yield and selectivity, with one study reporting 73% selectivity at 650°C. However, conversion rates remain low (10% at 650°C), and gas-phase reactions tend to dominate over catalytic reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10]. The use of S2 requires high temperatures (1200-1400°F) to form reactive diradical species, which could lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons [10.1002/cjce.5450480221].

SO2 as an oxidant:
SO2 increases propane conversion but faces challenges in maintaining high propylene selectivity. While it enhances overall conversion rates, selectivity to propylene decreases significantly. For example, at 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added [10.1002/jctb.5040340407]. SO2 also leads to the formation of various byproducts, including H2S, H2O, and CO2 [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].

Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants:
1. Byproduct formation: All sulfur-based oxidants produce various byproducts, including sulfur-containing compounds like CS2, thiol mercaptans, and S8 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity: This is particularly challenging for SO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
3. High temperature requirements: Especially for S2, which needs high temperatures to form reactive species [10.1002/cjce.5450480221].
4. Catalyst deactivation: Formation of coke and surface sulfides can lead to catalyst deactivation over time [10.1016/0021-9517(68)90017-1].

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing structure-activity relationships for rational catalyst design [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_10].
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions to enhance selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7].
3. Investigating reaction mechanisms to understand the complex effects of sulfur-based oxidants on the dehydrogenation process [10.1002/jctb.5040340407].
4. Exploring synergistic effects between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants [10.1016/S0167-2991(08)60185-8].
5. Developing efficient separation techniques for byproducts [10.1016/0021-9517(77)90228-7].
6. Studying long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under sulfur-rich conditions [10.1007/BF02071147].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP presents a promising alternative to conventional oxidants, offering potential improvements in propylene yield and selectivity. H2S and S2 show particular promise in reducing overoxidation and suppressing unwanted byproducts. However, significant challenges remain, particularly in terms of balancing conversion and selectivity, managing byproduct formation, and optimizing reaction conditions.

Future research should focus on developing novel catalysts specifically designed for sulfur-based ODHP, with an emphasis on understanding the structure-activity relationships at the molecular level. This could involve the use of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and guide catalyst design.

Additionally, exploring hybrid systems that combine sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants or other promoters could lead to synergistic effects that overcome the limitations of individual oxidants. The development of in-situ regeneration techniques for sulfur-poisoned catalysts and innovative reactor designs that can efficiently manage the formation and separation of sulfur-containing byproducts will be crucial for the practical implementation of these processes.

As environmental concerns grow, research into the life cycle assessment and potential environmental impacts of sulfur-based ODHP processes will be essential. This includes developing strategies for sulfur recovery and utilization, as well as ensuring that these processes align with increasingly stringent environmental regulations.

Ultimately, the success of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP will depend on their ability to offer significant advantages over conventional processes in terms of propylene yield, energy efficiency, and economic viability. As research progresses, pilot-scale studies and techno-economic analyses will be crucial in determining the feasibility of scaling up these promising technologies for industrial application.
