The literature primarily focuses on sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with limited information on other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2. The effectiveness of SO2 compared to conventional oxidants can be summarized as follows:

1. Conversion rate: SO2 increases the overall rate of propane conversion compared to conventional dehydrogenation.

2. Propylene yield: Despite enhancing conversion, SO2 significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation. At 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added, resulting in a lower propylene yield compared to conventional dehydrogenation.

3. Challenges associated with SO2:
   a) Selectivity: The main challenge is the significant decrease in propylene selectivity.
   b) Byproduct formation: The reaction produces H2S, H2O, and CO2 as byproducts. CO2 formation is particularly high in the early stages of the reaction.
   c) Catalyst deactivation: The catalyst loses some activity over time, possibly due to coke formation, requiring regeneration.

4. Key areas for future research:
   a) Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that maintain high selectivity to propylene while using SO2 or other sulfur-based oxidants.
   b) Reaction mechanism: Further investigate the complex effect of SO2 on the dehydrogenation mechanism to understand and mitigate the selectivity decrease.
   c) Byproduct management: Explore ways to reduce or utilize byproducts, particularly CO2 and H2S.
   d) Comparative studies: Conduct research on other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) to compare their effectiveness and challenges with SO2 and conventional oxidants.
   e) Process optimization: Investigate optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst composition) to balance conversion and selectivity when using sulfur-based oxidants.

In conclusion, while SO2 shows promise in increasing propane conversion rates, significant challenges remain in terms of selectivity and byproduct formation. Future research should focus on addressing these issues through improved catalyst design and process optimization.

The literature primarily focuses on SO2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with limited information on other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2. Based on the provided information:

1. Effectiveness of SO2:
- SO2 increases the conversion of propane compared to pure propane feed.
- However, the selectivity to propylene is significantly lower when SO2 is used.

7. Addressing potential environmental concerns related to sulfur-based oxidants.

The literature does not provide specific information on byproduct formation or a direct comparison with conventional oxidants, which are important areas for further research to fully assess the advantages and disadvantages of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP.

The literature provides some insights into the use of SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, but does not offer a comprehensive comparison with H2S, S2, or conventional oxidants like oxygen.

Effectiveness and Propylene Yield:
SO2 appears to be less effective than conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. The reaction with SO2 is described as "very slow and not selective". Propylene yields are generally low:
- With calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst: 14% selectivity at 31% propane conversion
- With molybdenum sulfide catalyst: 54% selectivity at 11% conversion, and 30% selectivity at 16% conversion

Challenges:
1. Low reactivity of propane with SO2
2. Poor selectivity to propylene
3. High tendency for complete combustion
4. Potential catalyst deactivation due to coke formation

Byproduct Formation:
The main byproducts appear to be combustion products, likely CO2 and water. Propylene was the only non-combustion product reported.

Comparison with Conventional Oxidants:
While SO2 shows poor performance for propane, it offers selectivity advantages over oxygen for many other hydrocarbon feeds. This is attributed to lower susceptibility to combustion and lack of direct heteroatom incorporation.

Future Research Areas:
1. Developing more selective catalysts that can suppress complete combustion
2. Improving propane activation and conversion while maintaining selectivity
3. Investigating reaction mechanisms to understand SO2's poor performance with propane
4. Exploring potential synergies between SO2 and other oxidants or promoters
5. Studying H2S and S2 as alternative sulfur-based oxidants for ODHP
6. Addressing catalyst deactivation issues

It's important to note that more comprehensive studies are needed to fully assess the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP and make definitive comparisons with conventional oxidants.

While the studies provide limited direct comparison with conventional oxidants, they suggest that sulfur-based systems, particularly those involving elementary sulfur, show potential for improving ODHP processes. However, significant research is still needed to overcome challenges related to propylene yield, selectivity, and process design before they can compete with conventional oxidants.

The literature does not directly compare sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, based on the provided information, we can infer some insights:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) are expected to be milder oxidants compared to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. This could potentially lead to improved selectivity towards propylene, but possibly at the cost of lower conversion rates.

2. Propylene yield: While specific propylene yields are not mentioned, the text indicates that using sulfur in place of or alongside halogens could still allow for high product yields in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Challenges:
   - High temperature requirements: S2 requires very high temperatures (1200-1400°F) to form reactive species, which could lead to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons.
   - H2S oxidation control: Careful control is needed to generate reactive sulfur species (S2, SH, S+*) while preventing the formation of inactive S8 rings.
   - Catalyst design: Development of catalysts that can efficiently utilize sulfur-based oxidants at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.

4. Byproduct formation: The document doesn't discuss specific byproducts for ODHP, but mentions the formation of various sulfur species during H2S oxidation, which could potentially lead to undesired side reactions or products.

5. Future research areas:
   - Catalyst development: Design catalysts that promote rapid reactions between sulfur species and hydrocarbons while minimizing S8 formation.
   - Process optimization: Find ways to generate reactive sulfur species at lower temperatures to avoid thermal cracking.

Overall, while sulfur-based oxidants show potential as milder alternatives to oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, significant research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with their use in ODHP and to optimize the process for improved propylene yields.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The study focuses primarily on SO2 as an oxidant. Based on the limited information provided, we can draw some insights:

1. SO2 as an oxidant:
- SO2 is effective in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene at temperatures between 600-700°C.
- The reaction occurs via a complex heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism.
- SO2 transforms into H2S, H2O, and S during the reaction.

2. Byproduct formation:
- The process produces various byproducts including ethane, ethylene, methane, CO, CO2, and coke.
- Oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S are also formed.

3. Reaction conditions:
- The reaction is typically carried out at temperatures between 600-700°C.
- A reaction mixture containing 10 vol% C3H8, 10 vol% SO2, and 80 vol% He is used.

4. Challenges:
- The formation of multiple byproducts suggests that selectivity towards propylene is a key challenge.
- Coke formation may lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

The literature does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, nor does it directly compare SO2 with conventional oxidants. More research would be needed to fully address the question and provide a comprehensive comparison of different oxidants in ODHP, including:
1. Comparative studies of H2S, S2, and SO2 with conventional oxidants in ODHP
2. Propylene yields for different oxidants
3. Specific challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant
4. Key areas for improving catalyst design for sulfur-based ODHP

The study primarily focuses on comparing H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant to conventional oxidation with O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The effectiveness of H2S is demonstrated through improved propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation without H2S.

Key findings on H2S as an oxidant:
1. Increased propylene selectivity (up to 70% at 700°C) and reduced unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4)
2. Higher propane conversion rates
3. Improved catalyst performance: V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst became effective for propylene production with H2S, whereas it was ineffective without H2S
4. Best propylene yield achieved was 30.4% with H2S present, which is reported to be higher than typical yields without H2S

The study suggests that S2, formed from H2S oxidation, may act as an active species similar to O2 in carrying out selective ODHP. This mechanism allows for H2S recovery and suppression of COx byproducts.

Challenges associated with H2S include:
1. Potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts (not extensively discussed in the text)
2. Need for optimized reaction conditions (temperature, contact time)
3. Handling of toxic gas, requiring additional safety measures

The study does not provide information on SO2 as an oxidant for ODHP.

Key areas for future research include:
1. Identifying more active and selective catalysts specifically for H2S-assisted ODHP
2. Further elucidating the role of H2S and potential S2 species in the reaction mechanism
3. Optimizing reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield
4. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under H2S-rich conditions
5. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants and their effectiveness in ODHP

Overall, the use of H2S as an oxidant in ODHP shows promising results for improving propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation methods. Further research is needed to fully optimize the process, understand the mechanisms involved, and address potential challenges for industrial application.

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur, primarily as H2S, to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts.

Key findings:
1. Impact on propylene yield: Adding trace amounts of sulfur (as H2S) significantly improved propylene yield. Without sulfur, the reaction was not selective for propylene. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene.

2. Specific challenges: 
   - Without sulfur, the main reaction was hydrogenolysis, producing methane and coke as primary products.
   - The presence of sulfur suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.
   - The reaction changed from exothermic (hydrogenolysis) to endothermic (dehydrogenation) with sulfur addition.

3. Key areas for future research:
   - Optimizing sulfur concentration: The study used 25-500 ppm, but further research could fine-tune this range.
   - Long-term catalyst stability: While the study showed good performance over six 24-hour cycles, longer-term effects need investigation.
   - Comparison with other sulfur compounds: The study mainly used H2S, but briefly mentioned thiophene. Further research could explore other sulfur compounds.
   - Mechanism understanding: More research is needed to fully understand how sulfur modifies the catalyst surface and reaction pathways.
   - Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) for ODHP
   - Exploring different catalyst compositions to further enhance propylene yield and selectivity

It's important to note that this study focused on catalytic dehydrogenation rather than oxidative dehydrogenation. For a comprehensive comparison of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, additional research would be necessary.

1. Identifying more active and selective catalysts specifically for H2S-assisted ODHP
2. Further elucidating the role of H2S and potential S2 species in the reaction mechanism
3. Optimizing reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield
4. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under H2S-rich conditions
5. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants and their effectiveness in ODHP

Overall, the use of H2S as an oxidant in ODHP shows promising results for improving propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation methods. Further research is needed to fully optimize the process, understand the mechanisms involved, and address potential challenges for industrial application.

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur, primarily as H2S, to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts.

Key findings:
1. Impact on propylene yield: Adding trace amounts of sulfur (as H2S) significantly improved propylene yield. Without sulfur, the reaction was not selective for propylene. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene.

2. Specific challenges: 
   - Without sulfur, the main reaction was hydrogenolysis, producing methane and coke as primary products.
   - The presence of sulfur suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.
   - The reaction changed from exothermic (hydrogenolysis) to endothermic (dehydrogenation) with sulfur addition.

3. Key areas for future research:
   - Optimizing sulfur concentration: The study used 25-500 ppm, but further research could fine-tune this range.
   - Long-term catalyst stability: While the study showed good performance over six 24-hour cycles, longer-term effects need investigation.
   - Comparison with other sulfur compounds: The study mainly used H2S, but briefly mentioned thiophene. Further research could explore other sulfur compounds.
   - Mechanism understanding: More research is needed to fully understand how sulfur modifies the catalyst surface and reaction pathways.
   - Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) for ODHP
   - Exploring different catalyst compositions to further enhance propylene yield and selectivity

It's important to note that this study focused on catalytic dehydrogenation rather than oxidative dehydrogenation. For a comprehensive comparison of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, additional research would be necessary.

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants. Each oxidant has different impacts on propylene yield and selectivity:

H2S:
- Can significantly improve propylene yield, especially when combined with O2
- Achieved 30.4% propylene yield at 700°C using γ-Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 catalysts
- Up to 60% propylene yield obtained with H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts at 705°C
- Effective at short residence times, suppressing cracking reactions

S2:
- Acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane
- Improves propylene yield and selectivity (73% selectivity at 650°C)
- However, conversion rates remain low (10% at 650°C)
- Gas-phase reactions dominate over catalytic reactions

SO2:
- Increases propane conversion but faces challenges in maintaining high propylene selectivity
- Selectivity decreases significantly (from 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure
- Results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts

Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants:
1. Formation of sulfur-based byproducts (CS2, thiol mercaptans, S8)
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity, especially for SO2
3. Kinetic inhibition of byproduct formation, particularly for S2ODHP
4. Optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst compositions for each oxidant

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing structure-activity relationships for rational catalyst design
2. Designing catalysts to inhibit byproduct formation
3. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions
4. Investigating long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts
5. Exploring novel catalyst supports and promoters
6. Developing in-situ/operando characterization techniques
7. Understanding and controlling gas-phase reactions, especially for S2-based ODHP
8. Developing catalysts with moderate redox properties to balance alkane activation and overoxidation

The provided literature offers very limited information to fully address the question about comparing different sulfur-based oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document only briefly mentions that sulfur-containing compounds have been attempted as mild oxidants for propane dehydrogenation, without providing specifics on H2S, S2, or SO2. There is no detailed discussion of their effectiveness, impact on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each oxidant, or key areas for future research in catalyst design and process optimization. The information given is insufficient to make a comprehensive comparison between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants in ODHP.
