[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[3] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to H2S and H2O, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."

[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen- ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."

[3] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions, however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

[4] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

"It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

"As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2J]."

"Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-103 and elemental sulfur [3,113 can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

"It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

"The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

"Propane: Very slow, very poor selectivity to propylene (11% C, 54% S; 16% C, 30% S)."

"With calcium-nickel phosphate (GHSV = 90) at 550C, selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion. With molybdenum sulfide (GHSV = 370 after 100 min and 60 min, respectively) at 500C, selectivity to propylene was 54% at 11% conversion and 30% at 16% conversion."

"Reaction of this compound is very slow and not selective; the main products are those of complete combustion. Propylene was the only noncombustion product found."

"For many feeds, the sulfur dioxide oxidation system offers substantial selectivity advantages over the oxygen system. This is due mainly to a much lower susceptibility to combustion and a lack of direct incorporation of heteroatoms in the feed molecule."

"Selective oxidation of hydrocarbons by SO2 has been the subject of many researches (refs. 1-7) but all the attempts to dehydrogenate propane have been failures (refs. 1-3)."

"Propylene, ethylene, methane, oxides of carbon and sulphur were the main products during propane oxidation over the studied catalysts. In the initial period of reaction CS2 and H2S were formed on a number of catalysts."

"Independent of treatment conditions, only one state of sulphur corresponding to So elementary sulphur was detected by ESCA"

"The data obtained suggest that in selective propane oxidation with SO2, the products of oxidative condensation containing C, H, O and elementary sulphur are the active species."

"It is known that elementary sulphur (refs. 10,11) can selectively dehydrogenate hydrocarbons; for this reason the effect of catalyst treatment with sulphur vapours on catalytic activity towards propylene formation has been tested (Fig. 3). The rate of propylene formation over the catalyst treated with sulphur vapours increases considerably."

"Taking into account the observed composition of reaction products and rate dependence, the scheme for propylene formation can be presented as follows:
1. SO2 + Z → ZS + ZO
2. ZS + RCH2 → R + SH2Z 
3. SH2Z + ZO → ZS + H2O + Z
4. ZS ⇌ Z + S"

[1] "Theoretical considerations (thermodynamic and mechanistic) will be presented to show that it should be possible to use sulphur alone or together with chlorine and/or bromine in place of iodine or iodine/halogen mixtures in the oxidative dehydrogenation of different hydrocarbons."

[2] "Oxygen, sulphur and selenium belong to Group VIA of the periodic table and exhibit similarities in their chemical properties. In general since the reactivity of elements in a given group decreases with increasing atomic weight, sulphur and selenium would be expected to act as milder oxidants than oxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."

[3] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-140O0F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (*), S,, in the high enough concentra- tions necessary for efficient dehydrogenation"

[4] "Oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to recover sulphur by the Clause Reaction is well known (Iz), Kinetics of H2S oxidation by explosion techniques and other methods has been studied ex- tensively (I3) and it has been shown that species such as Sz, SH, S+*, are formed as transient intermediates during the eventual formation of elemental sulphur in s8 rings."

[5] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the HPS and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HC. and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with HPS while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

[1] "It is known [1, 2] that, in the process of propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide on carbon, the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) containing C, H, O, and S is observed."

[2] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation by sulfur dioxide at 600-700°C over the catalysts under study occurs via a complicated heterogeneous-homogeneous mechanism. This reaction is accompanied by the formation of a series of products: C3H8 transforms into C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, CO2, and coke; SO2 transforms into H2S, H2O, and S."

[3] "The catalytic properties of samples in propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene in the presence of sulfur dioxide were studied in a flow setup at an atmospheric pressure at 600-700°C and a contact time of τ = 10 s."

[4] "A reaction mixture containing l0 vol % C3H8, 10, l0 vol % SO2, and 80 vol % He passed through a catalyst bed"

[1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."

[3] "V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was added to the feed gas."

[4] "Accordingly, the best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C."

[5] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

[7] "Interestingly, the selectivity to COx always stayed at a very low level in the presence of the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, indicating that the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons in the reaction was being suppressed. This can be attributed to the presence of H2S in the reaction system, since much more COx was produced without H2S over the same V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 C, as shown in table 2."

[1] "Trace amounts of sulfur (25-500 ppm) when added as H2S or thiophene increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation over platinum on magnesium aluminate."

[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."

[3] "In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene. This reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl2O4 in the absence of sulfur. The principal reaction was hydrogenolysis, with methane and coke the main products."

[4] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic. Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."

[1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."

[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[5] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[6] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[7] "The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed."

[8] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

[9] "Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. (234) The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions."

[10] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."

"There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."
