          [1] "Trace amounts of sulfur (25-500 ppm) when added as H2S or thiophene increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation over platinum on magnesium aluminate."

[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."

[3] "In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene. This reaction was not selective over Pt/MgAl2O4 in the absence of sulfur. The principal reaction was hydrogenolysis, with methane and coke the main products."

[4] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic. Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."

          The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur, primarily as H2S, to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts.

Key findings:
1. Impact on propylene yield: Adding trace amounts of sulfur (as H2S) significantly improved propylene yield. Without sulfur, the reaction was not selective for propylene. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene.

2. Specific challenges: 
   - Without sulfur, the main reaction was hydrogenolysis, producing methane and coke as primary products.
   - The presence of sulfur suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.
   - The reaction changed from exothermic (hydrogenolysis) to endothermic (dehydrogenation) with sulfur addition.

3. Key areas for future research:
   - Optimizing sulfur concentration: The study used 25-500 ppm, but further research could fine-tune this range.
   - Long-term catalyst stability: While the study showed good performance over six 24-hour cycles, longer-term effects need investigation.
   - Comparison with other sulfur compounds: The study mainly used H2S, but briefly mentioned thiophene. Further research could explore other sulfur compounds.
   - Mechanism understanding: More research is needed to fully understand how sulfur modifies the catalyst surface and reaction pathways.
   - Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) for ODHP
   - Exploring different catalyst compositions to further enhance propylene yield and selectivity

It's important to note that this study focused on catalytic dehydrogenation rather than oxidative dehydrogenation. For a comprehensive comparison of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, additional research would be necessary.

          该文献并未直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果。相反，它主要关注在Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂上进行丙烷催化脱氢时添加微量硫（主要是H2S）的影响。

主要发现：
1. 对丙烯产率的影响：添加微量硫（如H2S）显著提高了丙烯产率。没有硫时，反应对丙烯不具选择性。添加200 ppm H2S后，丙烷转化率超过28 mol%，丙烯选择性达到92-94%。

2. 特定挑战：
   - 没有硫时，主要反应是氢解，主要产物是甲烷和焦炭。
   - 硫的存在抑制了氢解和焦炭形成。
   - 添加硫后，反应从放热（氢解）变为吸热（脱氢）。

3. 未来研究的关键领域：
   - 优化硫浓度：研究使用了25-500 ppm，但需要进一步研究以精确调整这个范围。
   - 长期催化剂稳定性：虽然研究显示在六个24小时循环中表现良好，但需要研究更长期的影响。
   - 与其他硫化合物的比较：研究主要使用H2S，但简短提到了噻吩。进一步研究可以探索其他硫化合物。
   - 机理理解：需要更多研究以充分理解硫如何修饰催化剂表面和反应途径。
   - 研究其他硫基氧化剂（S2、SO2）在ODHP中的应用
   - 探索不同的催化剂组成，以进一步提高丙烯产率和选择性

需要注意的是，这项研究主要关注催化脱氢而非氧化脱氢。要全面比较硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的效果，还需要进行额外的研究。
