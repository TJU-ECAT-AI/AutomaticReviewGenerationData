          [1] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[2] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."

[3] "V2O5/A12O3 catalyst was found to be selective for the formation of COx, but not propene, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2S at 700 C. This same catalyst, however, turned out to be an effective catalyst for the ODH of propane when H2S was added to the feed gas."

[4] "Accordingly, the best propene yield achieved in this work was 30.4% over V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S in the feed at 0.005 s contact time and 700 C."

[5] "The result, therefore, that nearly all O2 is consumed by the H2S (figure 1) would suggest that the S2 product can act as an active species similar to O2 to carry out the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene as suggested in scheme 1, in which H2S is recovered and the COx products are significantly suppressed."

[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact time is a highly promising route for improving propene yield."

[7] "Interestingly, the selectivity to COx always stayed at a very low level in the presence of the V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, indicating that the over-oxidation of hydrocarbons in the reaction was being suppressed. This can be attributed to the presence of H2S in the reaction system, since much more COx was produced without H2S over the same V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 700 C, as shown in table 2."

          The study primarily focuses on comparing H2S as a sulfur-based oxidant to conventional oxidation with O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The effectiveness of H2S is demonstrated through improved propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation without H2S.

Key findings on H2S as an oxidant:
1. Increased propylene selectivity (up to 70% at 700°C) and reduced unwanted byproducts (COx, C2H4, CH4)
2. Higher propane conversion rates
3. Improved catalyst performance: V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst became effective for propylene production with H2S, whereas it was ineffective without H2S
4. Best propylene yield achieved was 30.4% with H2S present, which is reported to be higher than typical yields without H2S

The study suggests that S2, formed from H2S oxidation, may act as an active species similar to O2 in carrying out selective ODHP. This mechanism allows for H2S recovery and suppression of COx byproducts.

Challenges associated with H2S include:
1. Potential formation of sulfur-containing byproducts (not extensively discussed in the text)
2. Need for optimized reaction conditions (temperature, contact time)
3. Handling of toxic gas, requiring additional safety measures

The study does not provide information on SO2 as an oxidant for ODHP.

Key areas for future research include:
1. Identifying more active and selective catalysts specifically for H2S-assisted ODHP
2. Further elucidating the role of H2S and potential S2 species in the reaction mechanism
3. Optimizing reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield
4. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts under H2S-rich conditions
5. Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants and their effectiveness in ODHP

Overall, the use of H2S as an oxidant in ODHP shows promising results for improving propylene yields and selectivity compared to conventional oxidation methods. Further research is needed to fully optimize the process, understand the mechanisms involved, and address potential challenges for industrial application.

          该研究主要比较了H2S作为含硫氧化剂与常规O2氧化在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。H2S的效果通过提高丙烯产率和选择性得到了证明，相比不含H2S的常规氧化方法。

关于H2S作为氧化剂的主要发现：
1. 提高了丙烯选择性（在700°C时可达70%）并减少了不需要的副产物（COx、C2H4、CH4）
2. 更高的丙烷转化率
3. 改善了催化剂性能：V2O5/Al2O3催化剂在H2S存在下变得有效，而在没有H2S时则无效
4. 使用H2S时获得的最佳丙烯产率为30.4%，据报道高于没有H2S时的典型产率

研究表明，由H2S氧化形成的S2可能作为类似O2的活性物种进行选择性ODHP。这种机制允许H2S被回收并抑制COx副产物的生成。

与H2S相关的挑战包括：
1. 可能形成含硫副产品（文中未详细讨论）
2. 需要优化反应条件（温度，接触时间）
3. 处理有毒气体，需要额外的安全措施

该研究没有提供关于SO2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息。

未来研究的关键领域包括：
1. 识别更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂，专门用于H2S辅助的ODHP
2. 进一步阐明H2S和潜在S2物种在反应机理中的作用
3. 优化反应条件以获得最大丙烯产率
4. 研究催化剂在富H2S条件下的长期稳定性和再生
5. 探索其他硫基氧化剂及其在ODHP中的效果

总的来说，使用H2S作为ODHP的氧化剂在提高丙烯产率和选择性方面显示出比常规氧化方法更好的结果。需要进行进一步研究以充分优化该过程，理解所涉及的机制，并解决潜在的工业应用挑战。
