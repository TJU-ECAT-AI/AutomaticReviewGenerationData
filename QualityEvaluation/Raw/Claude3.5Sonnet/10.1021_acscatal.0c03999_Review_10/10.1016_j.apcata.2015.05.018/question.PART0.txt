The  gas-phase
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of  propane
 by  molecular
 chlorine
 was
 studied  in a flow  reactor
with
 a fixed  catalyst  bed  using  a series  of
 rutheniumtitania
 catalysts
 at  temperatures
 between
 150  and
450 C.  It was  found
 that  Ru/TiO2 catalyst
 prepared  by  the  incipient
 wetness
 impregnation
 of  titania
with
 an  aqueous
 hydrochloric
 acid  solution
 of  K4[Ru2OCl10]
 revealed
 the  highest
 catalytic
 activity.
 The
selectivity
 toward  propylene
 reached  95%  at  the  propane
 conversion
 of  50%  and  the  complete
 conversion
of
 chlorine
 at  400 C. Propane
 consumption
 turnover
 frequency
 was  45 103 s1 which  is comparable
with
 the  highest
 known  values  obtained
 at  the  oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane.
 Diffuse

UVvis
 spectroscopy
 and  X-ray  photoelectron

 study
 showed
 that  ruthenium
 oxychloride
was
 the active  component
 of  the  catalyst.

 Introduction
Propylene
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 large-tonnage
 products
of
 refining
 of
 natural
 gas
 and
 petroleum
 products.
 It
 is
 being
 isolated
from
 the
 products
 of
 the
 cracking,
 pyrolysis,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 thermal
and
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 [1].
 The
 catalytic
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane
 is
 the
 most
 direct
 and
 selective
 route
 for
 the
production
 of
 propylene.
 The
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 is
 per-
formed
 over
 variety
 of
 catalysts,
 notably,
 over
 Cr2O3,
 MoO3,
 V2O5,
TiO2,
 and
 GeO2 [24].
 The
 main
 problem
 limiting
 the
 industrial
application
 of
 this
 method
 is
 the
 necessity
 to
 use
 high
 temperatures
in
 order
 to
 increase
 the
 olefin
 equilibrium
 concentration
 since
 the
dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 is
 an
 endothermic
 reaction:
C3H8 
 C3H6 +
 H2,
 
r
298 =
 124.27
 kJ/mol.
 
(1)
In
 this
 case,
 the
 dehydrogenation
 is
 usually
 accompanied
 by
intense
 deposition
 of
 coke
 due
 to
 the
 high
 temperatures
 of
 the
process.
 Furthermore,
 one
 of
 the
 undesirable
 byproducts
 is
 methyl
acetylene
 which
 poisons
 the
 polymerization
 catalysts
 in
 the
 further
polypropylene
 production
 [5].
To
 overcome
 these
 problems,
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
propane
 over
 various
 catalysts
 is
 being
 developed
 [68].

propylene
 in
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 even
 over
 the
 best
 cat-
alysts
 known
 to
 date
 does
 not
 exceed
 35%
 which
 is
 not
 sufficient
 to
satisfy
 the
 economic
 feasibility.
 The
 yield
 of
 40%
 was
 achieved
 over
Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O
 mixed
 oxides
 [9].
 The
 highest
 selectivity
 (9496%)
was
 achieved
 at
 200 C
 over
 PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst
 at
 the
 conver-
sion
 of
 approximately
 20%
 [10].
The
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 by
 molecular
 oxygen
 is
 the
exothermic
 process:
C3H8 +
 1/2O2 
 C3H6 +
 H2O,
 
r
298 =
 117.57
 kJ/mol.
 
(2)
This
 process
 is
 accompanied
 by
 the
 deep
 oxidation
 of
 propane
to
 carbon
 dioxide
 and
 water:
C3H8 +
 5O2 
 3CO2 +
 4H2O,
 
r
298 =
 2044.04
 kJ/mol.
(3)
The
 latter
 complicates
 the
 industrial
 realization
 of
 this
 process
due
 to
 the
 necessity
 of
 waste-heat
 utilization.
There
 
are
 
attempts
 
to
 
use
 
various
 
organochlorine
 
com-
pounds
 [11,12],
 sulfur-containing
 compounds
 [13,14],
 nitrous
oxide
 [15,16],
 CO2 [17],
 and
 halogens
 [18]
 as
 mild
 oxidants
 for
 the
dehydrogenation
 of
 propane.
 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 the
 application
of
 halogens
 for
 the
 dehydrogenation
 was
 proposed
 more
 than
 40
years
 ago,
 based
 on
 thermodynamic
 calculations
 [18]. Pasternak
and
 Vadekar
 calculated
 the
 thermodynamics
 of
 the
 oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 hydrocarbons
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 different
 halogens.
Molecular
 chlorine
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 the
 most
 advantageous
 oxi-
dizing
 agent
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 thermodynamic
 calculations.

Formed
 HCl
 was
 proposed
 to
 be
 oxidized
 by
 oxygen
 back
 to
 Cl2 (the
Deacon
 reaction)
 [18].
It
 is
 assumed
 that
 the
 chlorination
 of
 propane
 leads
 to
 the
 for-
mation
 of
 monoclorides
 of
 propane:
C3H8 +
 Cl2 
 C3H7Cl
 +
 Cl,
 
r
298 =
 133.36
 kJ/mol.
 
(4)
These
 monochlorides
 are
 easily
 dechlorinated
 to
 form
 propyl-
ene:
C3H7Cl
 
 C3H6 +
 HCl,
 
r
298 =
 73.01
 kJ/mol.
 
(5)
The
 total
 enthalpy
 of
 the
 reaction:
C3H8 +
 Cl2 
 2HCl
 +
 C3H6,
 
r
298 =
 60.34
 kJ/mol.
 
(6)
is
 60.34
 kJ/mol
 only,
 which
 simplifies
 the
 task
 of
 waste-heat
 uti-
lization.
 For
 many
 years,
 this
 way
 of
 the
 olefins
 production
 was
thermodynamically
 complicated
 by
 the
 necessity
 to
 perform
 the
Deacon
 reaction,
 for
 which
 no
 effective
 catalysts
 were
 available.
Nowadays,
 a
 RuO2/TiO2 catalyst
 is
 proposed
 for
 the
 Deacon
 reac-
tion
 that
 allows
 performing
 this
 process
 at
 temperatures
 below
300 C
 [1921].
 Catalysts
 based
 on
 ruthenium
 also
 show
 good
 per-
formance
 in
 other
 reactions
 involving
 chlorine
 or
 its
 derivatives,
such
 as
 the
 oxychlorination
 of
 methane
 and
 ethane
 [22].
 Probably,
the
 reactivity
 of
 ruthenium
 compounds
 in
 the
 reactions
 involving
chlorine
 and
 organochlorines
 is
 due
 to
 the
 high
 ruthenium
 affinity
to
 chlorine.
 Hevia
 et
 al.
 [23]
 suggested
 that
 the
 active
 site
 of
 the
RuO2/TiO2 catalyst
 in
 the
 Deacon
 reaction
 was
 RuO2xClx ruthe-
nium
 oxychloride.
 Crihan
 et
 al.
 [20]
 indicated
 that
 RuO2 surface
 was
chlorinated
 during
 the
 catalyzed
 oxidation
 of
 HCl
 with
 oxygen
 by
selective
 replacement
 of
 bridging
 oxygen
 atoms
 by
 bridging
 chlo-
rine
 atoms.
 This
 view
 was
 confirmed
 by
 Teschner
 et
 al.
 [24]
 showed
that
 the
 surface
 of
 RuO2 was
 extensively
 chlorinated
 at
 typical
 Dea-
con
 reaction
 conditions.
 It
 was
 shown
 that
 the
 K4Ru2OCl10/TiO2
catalyst
 was
 more
 active
 in
 the
 Deacon
 reaction
 in
 comparison
 with
RuO2 and
 exceeds
 all
 known
 catalysts
 for
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 in
the
 oxychlorination
 of
 ethane
 and
 methane
 [22].
The
 aim
 of
 this
 work
 was
 the
 study
 of
 catalysts
 based
 on
 ruthe-
nium
 oxychloride
 in
 the
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 by
molecular
 chlorine.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
 and
 characterization
Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 (0.28
 wt.%
 Ru)
 was
 prepared
 by
 the
 incipi-
ent
 wetness
 impregnation
 of
 titania
 (Degussa
 P-25
 with
 a
 specific
surface
 area
 of
 57
 m2/g
 and
 a
 pore
 volume
 of
 0.36
 cm3/g)
 with
 an
aqueous
 hydrochloric
 acid
 solution
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 (Aurat,
 Russia)
with
 pH
 =
 1
 at
 90 C
 followed
 by
 drying
 at
 110 C
 and
 calcination
in
 air
 at
 350 C
 for
 2
 h.
 Low
 solubility
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 in
 water
complicates
 the
 preparation
 of
 the
 catalyst
 with
 high
 ruthenium
content
 (the
 maximum
 ruthenium
 content
 we
 were
 able
 to
 achieve
by
 incipient
 wetness
 impregnation
 was
 0.4
 wt.%).
 Therefore,
 we
applied
 another
 synthesis
 approaches
 to
 obtain
 Ru/TiO2 catalysts
with
 higher
 ruthenium
 content.
 Ru/TiO2-2
 catalyst
 (2
 wt.%
 Ru)
 was
prepared
 by
 the
 oxidation
 of
 Ru(III)
 (RuCl3)
 to
 Ru(IV)
 by
 potas-
sium
 perchlorate
 (KClO4).
 For
 this
 purpose,
 the
 titanium
 oxide
 was
impregnated
 by
 the
 incipient
 wetness
 method
 with
 a
 solution
 of
RuCl3 (Aurat,
 Russia)
 and
 dried
 in
 air
 at
 60 C
 for
 2
 h.
 Then,
 the
resulting
 RuCl3/TiO2 was
 impregnated
 by
 a
 solution
 of
 KClO4 +
 KCl
(Vekton,
 Russia).
 The
 concentration
 of
 KClO4 was
 25
 g/L
 and
 the
concentration
 of
 KCl
 was
 16
 g/L.
 The
 resulting
 sample
 was
 washed
with
 deionized
 water
 and
 dried
 at
 60 C
 for
 2
 h.
 Ru/TiO2-3
 catalyst
(5
 wt.%
 Ru)
 was
 prepared
 by
 the
 mechanical
 mixing
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
and
 TiO2.
 Necessary
 amounts
 of
 regents
 were
 mixed
 until
 a
 homo-
geneous
 mass
 was
 obtained
 and
 then
 it
 was
 triturated
 in
 a
 mortar
for
 1
 h.
 The
 amount
 of
 ruthenium
 in
 the
 samples
 was
 determined
by
 atomic
 emission
 spectroscopy
 with
 inductively
 coupled
 plasma
using
 an
 Optima
 4300
 DV
 PerkinElmer
 spectrometer.
UVvis
 diffuse
 reflectance
 (UVvis
 DR)
 spectra
 were
 recorded
by
 a
 Shimadzu
 UV-2501
 PC
 spectrophotometer
 equipped
 with
an
 ISR-240A
 diffuse
 reflectance
 attachment.
 The
 spectra
 were
registered
 with
 respect
 to
 a
 BaSO4 powder
 in
 the
 range
 of
11,000
 
 53,000
 cm1.
 The
 obtained
 reflectance
 spectra
 were
converted
 into
 the
 F(R)
 KubelkaMunk
 function.
 A
 crystalline
K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 sample
 was
 also
 studied
 by
 UVvis
 DR
 spec-
troscopy
 for
 comparison.
X-ray
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
 (XPS)
 studies
 were
 per-
formed
 on
 a
 photoelectron
 spectrometer
 (SPECS
 Surface
 Nano
Analysis
 GmbH)
 equipped
 with
 a
 hemispherical
 PHOIBOS-150
 ana-
lyzer
 and
 an
 XR-50
 X-ray
 source
 with
 a
 double
 Mg/Al
 anode.
 The
XPS
 spectra
 were
 acquired
 in
 the
 fixed
 pass
 energy
 mode
 using
 Mg
K
 radiation
 (h
 =
 1253.6
 eV).
 Relative
 concentrations
 of
 elements
were
 determined
 from
 the
 total
 intensities
 of
 corresponding
 core-
level
 spectra
 using
 cross-sections
 according
 to
 Scofield
 [25].
 All
 the
spectra
 were
 analyzed
 using
 the
 FitXPS
 software.
 In
 short,
 after
subtraction
 of
 a
 Shirley-type
 background
 [26],
 the
 spectra
 were
 fit
using
 Gaussian/Lorentzian
 line-shapes.
 The
 charge
 effect
 was
 cor-
rected
 by
 setting
 the
 C1s
 peak
 (due
 to
 adventitious
 hydrocarbons)
at
 284.8
 eV.
 For
 the
 XPS
 study,
 the
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 was
 chosen
due
 to
 the
 highest
 catalytic
 activity.
2.2.
 Catalyst
 testing
The
 catalytic
 experiments
 were
 performed
 in
 a
 tubular
 flow
reactor
 with
 a
 fixed
 catalyst
 bed
 (quartz
 tube
 of
 200
 mm
 long
 and
with
 an
 inner
 diameter
 of
 7
 mm)
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure
 in
 the
temperature
 range
 of
 150450 C.
 The
 amount
 of
 catalyst
 placed
into
 the
 reactor
 was
 1.0
 g.
 Propane
 and
 argon
 (Sibtekhgaz,
 Russia)
with
 a
 purity
 of
 at
 least
 99.9%
 were
 introduced
 into
 the
 reactor
using
 mass-flow
 controllers.
 Chlorine
 produced
 in
 an
 electrolytic
cell
 was
 supplied
 with
 a
 mixture
 of
 argon.
 All
 technological
 tubes
and
 tanks
 of
 chlorine
 were
 isolated
 from
 the
 light.
 The
 quantity
of
 generated
 chlorine
 was
 calculated
 according
 to
 the
 electro-
chemical
 equivalent
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 electricity
 passed
 through
the
 saturated
 sodium
 chloride
 solution
 used
 as
 an
 electrolyte.
The
 gas
 hourly
 space
 velocity
 (GHSV)
 of
 propane
 and
 chlorine
were
 200
 and
 50
 (100)
 h1,
 respectively.
 The
 argon
 was
 supplied
with
 the
 GHSV
 of
 400
 h1.
 The
 molar
 ratio
 of
 the
 reactants
 was
C3H8:Cl2:Ar
 =
 2:(0.51):4.
 The
 total
 GHSV
 of
 the
 reactant
 feed
 was
650700
 h1.
 Sampling
 gaseous
 products
 was
 performed
 directly
at
 the
 reactor
 outlet.
 The
 reaction
 products
 were
 analyzed
 by
 a
Tsvet-570
 chromatograph
 equipped
 with
 a
 specially
 made
 capil-
lary
 column
 (20
 m
 ×
 0.32
 mm)
 with
 a
 DVB-PLOT
 stationary
 phase
and
 a
 flame
 ionization
 detector.
At
 the
 gas-phase
 chlorination
 of
 propane
 (4),
 only
 half
 of
 the
chlorine
 atoms
 leads
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 chlorocarbons
 and
 the
other
 half
 provides
 hydrogen
 chloride.
 When
 performing
 the
 reac-
tion
 in
 excess
 of
 the
 hydrocarbon
 with
 a
 molar
 ratio
 of
 C3H8/Cl2 =
 4
(or
 C3H8/Cl2 =
 2
 in
 some
 experiments)
 at
 the
 complete
 consumption
of
 chlorine
 and
 the
 formation
 of
 only
 monochlorinated
 hydro-
carbon,
 the
 conversion
 of
 propane
 will
 not
 exceed
 25%
 (or
 50%,
respectively).
 The
 conversion
 of
 propane
 will
 be
 lower
 in
 case
 of
the
 formation
 of
 deeply
 chlorinated
 compounds.

 The
 spectrum
 of
 ruthenium
 oxychloride
 is
 characterized
by
 bands
 at
 14,000,
 17,000,
 and
 20,000
 cm1 (curve

 The
 spec-
trum
 of
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 (curve

 contains
 the
 bands
of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
 as
 well
 as
 an
 additional

 at
 22,600
 cm1
(curve

 characteristic
 for
 K4[Ru2O2(H2O)4Cl8]
 ruthenium
 com-
plex,
 probably
 formed
 by
 the
 partial

 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]
[27,28].
 The

 of
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-2
 catalyst
 (curve

also
 contains
 the
 bands
 at
 14,000,
 17,000,
 and
 20,000

 how-
ever
 the
 ratio
 of
 intensities
 of
 these
 bands
 is
 different
 from
 that
 of
the
 spectrum
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10],
 which
 is
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 forma-
tion
 of
 various
 ruthenium
 oxychlorides.
 The
 manifestation
 of
 the
band
 at
 14,000

 the
 presence
 of
 [Ru2OCl10]4anions.
It
 is
 well

 [29]
 that
 the

 has
 the

 and
 may
 be

 as
 well
 as
 the
 freshly

 studied
 by
 XPS.
 The
 atomic
ratios
 of
 the
 elements
 in

 layer
 of
 the
 samples
 are
shown
 in

 1.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 the
 [K]/[Ru]
 atomic
 ratio
observed
 for
 the
 crystalline
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 sample
 slightly
 dif-
fer
 from
 the
 stoichiometric
 composition.
 It
 may
 be
 because
 XPS
is
 a
 surface-sensitive
 method,
 the
 XPS
 analysis
 depth
 is
 several
nanometers
 only.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 [O]/[Ru]
 atomic
 ratio
 on
the
 surface
 is
 the
 same
 as
 that
 in
 the
 bulk.
 The
 content
 of
 chlo-
rine
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O
 is
 reduced.
 It
 seems
 to
 be
due
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 RuOx species
 on
 the
surface
 of
 crystalline
 K4[Ru2OCl10]·H2O.
 Note,
 that
 in
 both
 cases,
oxygen
 on
 the
 surface
 occupies
 bridging
 positions
 between
 the
 two
neighboring
 ruthenium
 cations.
 In
 contrast,
 the
 content
 of
 chlo-
rine
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 fresh
 Ru/TiO2-1
 catalyst
 is
 overstated.
It
 indicates
 that
 the
 surface
 of
 titania
 is
 partially
 covered
 by
 chlo-
rine
 species.
