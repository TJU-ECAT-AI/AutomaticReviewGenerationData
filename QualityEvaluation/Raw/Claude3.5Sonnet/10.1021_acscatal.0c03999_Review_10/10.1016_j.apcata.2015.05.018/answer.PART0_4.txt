[1] "There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information to fully answer the question about comparing different sulfur-based oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document only briefly mentions that sulfur-containing compounds have been attempted as mild oxidants for propane dehydrogenation, without providing specifics on H2S, S2, or SO2. There is no discussion of their effectiveness, impact on propylene yield, specific challenges, or areas for future research in catalyst design and process optimization. To properly address this question would require additional information beyond what is provided in the given text.

这篇文献没有提供足够的详细信息来全面回答关于比较不同硫基氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的问题。文档仅简要提到含硫化合物被尝试用作丙烷脱氢的温和氧化剂,但没有提供关于H2S、S2或SO2的具体信息。文中没有讨论它们的有效性、对丙烯产率的影响、具体挑战,或催化剂设计和工艺优化的未来研究领域。要正确回答这个问题需要超出给定文本所提供的额外信息。
