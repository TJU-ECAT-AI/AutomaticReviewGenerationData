<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on MCM-41 for the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant. It does not discuss H2S, S2, SO2, or other sulfur-based oxidants in relation to ODHP.

To properly answer this question, additional research would be needed on the use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, their effectiveness compared to conventional oxidants, challenges associated with each, impact on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and areas for future research in catalyst design and process optimization.

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于硫基氧化剂或它们与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的比较信息。该文档主要讨论了以MCM-41为载体的铬氧化物催化剂,用于以CO2作为氧化剂的丙烷脱氢反应。它没有讨论H2S、S2、SO2或其他硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的应用。

要正确回答这个问题,需要对硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的使用、它们与常规氧化剂的效果比较、每种氧化剂相关的挑战、对丙烯产率的影响、副产物形成以及催化剂设计和工艺优化的未来研究领域进行额外的研究。

The given scientific literature does not contain information about sulfur-based oxidants or their comparison with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on chromium oxide catalysts supported on MCM-41 for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. It does not discuss H2S, S2, SO2, or other sulfur-based oxidants in relation to ODHP.

To properly answer this question, additional research and literature focused specifically on sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP would be required. The current document does not provide the necessary information to compare the effectiveness, challenges, or research areas related to sulfur-based oxidants versus conventional oxidants in ODHP.

给定的科学文献中没有关于硫基氧化剂或其与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯方面的比较信息。该文档主要讨论了MCM-41负载的氧化铬催化剂用于CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论H2S、S2、SO2或其他硫基氧化剂与ODHP的关系。

要正确回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究并查阅专门针对ODHP中硫基氧化剂的文献。目前的文档没有提供必要的信息来比较硫基氧化剂与常规氧化剂在ODHP中的有效性、挑战或研究领域。

It does not discuss H2S, S2, SO2, or other sulfur-based oxidants in relation to ODHP.

Without relevant information in the provided text, I cannot make a meaningful comparison between sulfur-based oxidants and conventional oxidants for ODHP, discuss their impact on propylene yield, address specific challenges associated with each oxidant, or suggest key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the process.

To answer this question accurately, additional literature or research specifically focused on sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP would be required.

给定的科学文献中没有关于硫基氧化剂或其与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯过程中的比较信息。该文档主要讨论了以MCM-41为载体的铬氧化物催化剂,用于以CO2为氧化剂的丙烷脱氢反应。文中没有涉及H2S、S2、SO2或其他硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的应用。

由于提供的文本中没有相关信息,我无法对硫基氧化剂和常规氧化剂在ODHP中的效果进行有意义的比较,也无法讨论它们对丙烯产率的影响,阐述与每种氧化剂相关的具体挑战,或建议改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程的关键研究领域。

要准确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门针对ODHP中硫基氧化剂的文献或研究。
