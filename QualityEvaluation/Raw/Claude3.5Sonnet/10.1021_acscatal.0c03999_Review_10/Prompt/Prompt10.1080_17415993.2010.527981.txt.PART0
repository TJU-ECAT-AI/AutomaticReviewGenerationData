The objective of this study was to examine the sulfur-mediated oxidation of ethane to ethylene. In summary,
it has been found that ethylene can be produced in high yield (ca 75%) by the oxidation of ethane with
excess sulfur in the 800850 C temperature range using a residence time of about 1 s. It is surmised that
the high ethylene yield arises from the relatively weak CS bond which precludes the formation of carbon
sulfur compounds so favoring pathways to ethylene. A process scheme is suggested which incorporates
ethylene production into sulfur recovery, plants for which are found in essentially all refineries and in
sour gas processing. A potential advantage of this chemistry over standard ethane steam cracking is that
the sulfur process considerably increases carbon efficiency for ethylene production as most of the energy
required for ethylene synthesis is supplied by the oxidation of H2S.

Introduction
Most of the worlds ethylene arises from steam cracking of ethane and more complex hydrocar-
bon mixtures, although it can also be recovered from off-gases from refinery catalytic cracking
and coking units. State-of-the-art steam-cracking plants can achieve moderate ethylene yield (ca
65%) from ethane with by-product combustion supplying some of the heat needed to support the
endothermic cracking processes (1). Nevertheless, over the last decade or so, new methods have
been sought for selective and thermally efficient ethylene production. In particular, the research
conducted by Schmidt and co-workers (210), among many studies, has investigated the chem-
istry and technology for production of ethylene by catalytic partial oxidation of ethane and other
hydrocarbons.
The extensive research of Schmidt and co-workers has shown that yields of ethylene, equivalent
or better than those obtained by conventional steam cracking, can be realized by passing O2 and
ethane over a Pt-based catalyst. Analysis of numerous data sets from the studies on this reaction
suggest (11) that ethylene is formed, in the main, by catalytic oxidation of part of the ethane
to CO2, CO and H2O at the Pt surface with the heat of reaction of these processes promoting
the thermal conversion of the remaining ethane to ethylene and H2 via gas-phase, radical-based

chemistry. Direct conversion of ethane to ethylene via surface species also plays a role in the high
selectivity to ethylene (11). To date, this type of process has not been commercialized, perhaps
a consequence of the complexity of mixing ethane and pure oxygen safely on a large scale and
because of the high cost of producing O2 from air.
Research in our laboratories has examined the use of S2 in place of O2. Sulfur is a primary
product of the thermal stage of the modified Claus sulfur recovery process, a standard unit found
in all refineries processing sulfur-containing crude oils (12). In addition to being a vital technology
in an oil refinery, the furnace of the Claus plant is equivalent to an air separation plant operating at
1200 C because S2, formed by the reaction of H2S with O2 in the furnace, is a chemical equivalent
to O2. A brief explanation of the Claus process will be helpful in explaining the relevance of the
research described in the body of this paper.
In a refinery, H2S, recovered from hydrotreater off-gases, is fed to a furnace where partial
oxidation converts ca 65% of the H2S to S2, which on condensation yields liquid sulfur (S8) at ca
140 C. The combustion, in most cases, is supported by air resulting in a furnace temperature of
approximately 1200 C, the actual temperature being dependent on the partial pressure of the H2S
in the feed acid gas which may also contain CO2 and H2O. The other products of partial oxidation
are H2O and SO2which pass from the waste heat boiler and furnace sulfur condenser, along with
unreacted H2S and N2, to a series of catalytic converters which yield further elemental sulfur.
The primary condensation of sulfur from the combustion stage then acts as the air separation
equivalent. As is illustrated in Figure 1, the heat produced in the Claus furnace is recovered as
steam, but in a sulfur-based process for ethylene, the heat produced in a parallel Claus-type furnace
that is reprocessing the H2S formed during ethylene formation would be harnessed to convert the
condensed liquid sulfur to S2 for reaction with ethane (Figure 1). The H2S and SO2 produced in
the dedicated furnace would be combined with the gases entering the Claus catalytic converter
train in order to maintain high S recovery.
Experimental studies reported here show that ethylene can be obtained in 7579% yield by
contacting ethane with S2 at 800850 C with reformation of H2S and co-production of a small
amount of CS2, a solvent used in Rayon production. If there is no outlet for CS2, it would be
recycled with the H2S to the ethylene furnace for reconversion to sulfur (Figure 1). The scale of
such an ethylene plant is coupled to the turnover of H2S and CS2 through the dedicated furnace
as it provides the thermal energy to drive the conversion of ethane to ethylene. Importantly, it is

evident that ethylene production by this technology would be driven by partial oxidation of H2S
to sulfur essentially harnessing the free energy of O2. The thermo-chemical data of the overall
processes illustrate the favorable energy balance for an ethylene plant based on this chemistry.

Clearly, excess heat energy is produced from H2S oxidation for the conversion, although it should
also be noted that pre-heat of the ethane and sulfur feeds will also be required, with heat recovery
fromtheproductstreamnecessarytomaintainheatbalancefortheoverallprocess(heatexchangers
are not shown in Figure 1). Important industrial aspects of the process are that there are no technical
limitations in mixing sulfur vapor with ethane and the technology required for the reactors would
be equivalent to those used in a Claus furnace. This paper presents data which underpin the
ethylene process illustrated in Figure 1 and discusses the thermal efficiency and carbon balance
associated with sulfur-assisted partial oxidation of ethane to ethylene.

Previous studies and background to the experimental design
Little work has been conducted on the conversion of ethane to ethylene by sulfur and only one
study reports some success. Garwood et al. (13) reported that CS2 was the major carbon-containing
product when ethane was passed over a zeolite catalyst that had been impregnated with sulfur
and they did not detect ethylene. In the 1950s, Morningstar reported ethylene formation in a
study in which ethane was bubbled through a reactor-containing liquid sulfur at temperatures of
600850 C (14). These authors calculated the ethane/sulfur feed ratio based on the amount of
H2S that was formed in the reaction, although the actual ratio would have been a function of the
mixing patterns occurring in the reactor. Ethylene yields of 50% were reported at 874 C using
an ethane/sulfur ratio of ca 7 and a residence time of 7 s. Morningstar also reported that acetylene
became a major product as the ethane/sulfur feed ratio decreased.
In related work, Pasternak and co-workers at Imperial Oil laboratories in Sarnia, Ontario, passed
ethane with H2S and O2 over a CdS catalyst demonstrating that high yields of ethylene (ca 70%)
could be achieved with in situ formation of sulfur species (15, 16). Despite these high yields,
no attempts have been made to commercialize this type of process, possibly because water co-
product of H2S oxidation leads to formation of CO, COS and CO2 which would complicate the
separation and purification of ethylene. Most likely, at the time of the Pasternak (15, 16) study,
there was little incentive to implement a high efficiency, low carbon-emission ethylene process.
As an aid to the experimental design, equilibrium calculations were conducted allowing for
the absence or presence of solid carbon as a product (Table 1). These calculations employed an
inlet feed temperature of 600 C and studied the effect of varying the inlet ethane/sulfur ratio.
When carbon is allowed to form, ethylene is predicted in negligible quantities and carbon, H2
and CH4 are the only products of note. Data from these calculations will not be analyzed further
as laboratory studies show that, although some carbon-based products are formed, the quantities
produced are much less than predicted. The equilibrium calculations excluding carbon formation
(Table 2) show that ethylene is predicted to form to almost 25% at an ethanesulfur ratio of
8:1. CH4, CS2 and propylene were also formed in significant quantities with CH4 predicted
as, by far, the largest carbon-containing product. At lower ethanesulfur ratios, less ethylene
and propylene are expected at equilibrium with CS2 becoming a major product. Overall, these
calculations suggest that high ethane/sulfur ratios should favor ethylene production, although only
in moderate equilibrium yield, with CH4 as the dominant carbon-containing product.

Ethanesulfur reactions
Table 3 summarizes the data obtained from the reaction of ethane with sulfur at 800 C and 850 C
over selected residence times and a ethanesulfur feed ratio of approximately 4:1 (note that it was
difficult to control the sulfur feed rate precisely with the liquid sulfur delivery system (LSDS) so
the feed ratios were not exactly the same for each experiment). C and S2 product quantities were
calculated from mass balance equations with [C] representing any non-gaseous carbon-containing
species reported in the tables. Despite attempts to detect other carbon-containing species, the
only volatile products that were observed were propylene and thiophene albeit in only very small
quantities (<0.01 mole%). The isolation of dark-colored sulfur, in experiments which gave high
yields of [C], suggests that carbon was present in the liquid sulfur, most likely as complex CS
polymeric species, usually referred to as carsul. The sulfur referred to here is unconsumed reagent
sulfur (Table 3).
The first point to note from the data sets shown in Table 3 is that the ethanesulfur system
operates under kinetic control at the limited residence times used in this study as very high

ethylene yields (77.379.6%) could be obtained at 800 C and 850 C. In addition, as can be
seen by comparison with the reference experiments without sulfur, ethylene yields significantly
exceeded those obtained for thermal and O2-promoted conditions (Table 4).
For experiments at 800 C, it was observed that selectivity to and yield of ethylene increased
as the residence time was reduced from 3.0 to 1.2 s at a feed ethane/sulfur ratio of 4.59, 4.41
and 5.29, respectively. The highest yield of ethylene obtained at 800 C (77.3%) was observed
using a 1.2 s residence time which, in terms of carbon efficiency, can be explained by the
lower production of CH4, CS2 and [C]. Indeed, based on these observations, it is concluded
that ethylene formation occurs rapidly with further reaction of the product ethylene yielding
methane, more complex carbon products [C] and CS2 at longer contact times. H2 and H2S
were the other major products formed in an approximate 1:0.5 molar ratio with respect to the
amount of ethylene produced. At 850 C, a significantly lower yield of ethylene was obtained
using a 1.2 s residence time (70.8% compared with 77.4% at 800 C), the lower yield result-
ing from, most probably, the decomposition of hydrocarbon species to carsul-type products
(Table 3).
As was the case for the experiments at 800 C, reference experiments at 850 C which examined
either thermal cracking of ethane or the O2-assisted partial oxidation resulted in lower ethylene
yields (66.7% and 62.5%, respectively, Table 4) in comparison to when sulfur was present (70.8%,
Table 3). Note, however, that the reference experiments were conducted using a 0.5 s residence
time compared with 1.2 s for the sulfur-promoted reaction. Although not presented in detail here,
