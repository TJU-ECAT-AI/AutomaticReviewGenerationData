[1] "Attempts at reducing the coke buildup by adding oxygen to the feed have not been successful, as shown in Fig. 2. The amount of oxygen added in Fig. 2 was sufficient to lower the isoprene selectivity by about 2% without affecting the decline in activity. Increased amounts of oxygen merely resulted in further burnup."

[2] "Propane: Very slow, very poor selectivity to propylene (11% C, 54% S; 16% C, 30% S)."

[3] "Propylene: Moderately slow and unselective. Mainly combustion products."

[4] "For many feeds, the sulfur dioxide oxidation system offers substantial selectivity advantages over the oxygen system. This is due mainly to a much lower susceptibility to combustion and a lack of direct incorporation of heteroatoms in the feed molecule."

The literature does not directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. However, it does provide some insights on SO2 as an oxidant compared to oxygen for various hydrocarbons, including propane and propylene.

For propane oxidation, SO2 shows very poor selectivity to propylene, with low conversion (11-16%) and moderate selectivity (30-54%). This suggests that SO2 is not an effective oxidant for propane dehydrogenation.

For propylene oxidation, SO2 is described as moderately slow and unselective, mainly producing combustion products. This indicates that SO2 is also not suitable for selective oxidation of propylene.

However, for many other hydrocarbon feeds, SO2 oxidation offers substantial selectivity advantages over oxygen. This is attributed to lower susceptibility to combustion and lack of direct heteroatom incorporation into the product.

The main challenge associated with SO2 as an oxidant appears to be its low activity and poor selectivity for certain reactions, particularly for smaller hydrocarbons like propane and propylene. Additionally, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a significant issue, which cannot be effectively mitigated by adding oxygen to the feed.

Future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the process should focus on:

1. Developing more active and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation using SO2.
2. Addressing catalyst deactivation issues, possibly by exploring novel catalyst compositions or regeneration methods.
3. Investigating the reaction mechanisms to understand why SO2 is less effective for smaller hydrocarbons compared to larger ones.
4. Exploring potential synergies between SO2 and other oxidants or promoters to enhance activity and selectivity.

While the document does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, these could be areas for future research to compare their effectiveness against SO2 and conventional oxygen-based systems for propane dehydrogenation.

文献没有直接比较H2S、S2和SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些关于SO2作为氧化剂与氧气相比对各种碳氢化合物（包括丙烷和丙烯）的作用的见解。

对于丙烷氧化，SO2显示出非常差的丙烯选择性，转化率低（11-16%）且选择性中等（30-54%）。这表明SO2不是丙烷脱氢的有效氧化剂。

对于丙烯氧化，SO2被描述为反应速度中等且选择性差，主要产生燃烧产物。这表明SO2也不适合选择性氧化丙烯。

然而，对于许多其他碳氢化合物原料，SO2氧化提供了比氧气更大的选择性优势。这归因于较低的燃烧倾向和缺乏直接的杂原子掺入产物中。

SO2作为氧化剂的主要挑战似乎是其对某些反应的低活性和差选择性，特别是对丙烷和丙烯等较小的碳氢化合物。此外，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个重要问题，通过向进料中添加氧气无法有效缓解这个问题。

未来改进催化剂设计和优化工艺的研究应该集中在：

1. 开发更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂，用于SO2丙烷脱氢。
2. 解决催化剂失活问题，可能通过探索新型催化剂组成或再生方法。
3. 研究反应机理，以了解为什么SO2对较小的碳氢化合物的效果不如较大的碳氢化合物。
4. 探索SO2与其他氧化剂或促进剂之间的潜在协同作用，以提高活性和选择性。

虽然文档没有提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的信息，但这些可能是未来研究的方向，以比较它们与SO2和传统氧气系统在丙烷脱氢中的有效性。
