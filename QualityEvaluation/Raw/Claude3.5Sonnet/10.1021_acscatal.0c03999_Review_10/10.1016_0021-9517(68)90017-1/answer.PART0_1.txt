[1] "We have screened 60 catalysts for the oxygen oxidation of isoamylene. A large number of these were quite similar in their performance, among which bismuth molybdate was typical."

[2] "Of these oxidants, sulfur dioxide is perhaps the most common and easiest handled. The patent literature discloses a number of cases where it is used for oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "Very little dimethylthiophene was formed: the selectivity to this material was only 1-2% at 500-600C. Dimethylfuran was the major product formed with 79% selectivity at 47% conversion at 550C."

[4] "Reaction rates and product selectivities are very dependent on hydrocarbon feed structure. Branching and increasing chain length increase reactivity substantially."

[5] "Propane... Very slow, very poor selectivity to propylene (11% C, 54% S; 16% C, 30% S)."

The literature does not directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. However, it does provide some insights on SO2 as an oxidant for various hydrocarbons, which can be used to infer potential impacts on propane dehydrogenation:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 appears to be less effective for propane dehydrogenation compared to other hydrocarbons. The literature reports very slow reaction rates and poor selectivity to propylene when using SO2 as an oxidant for propane.

2. Yield: The propylene yield from propane using SO2 as an oxidant is likely to be low, given the reported poor selectivity (30-54%) and low conversion (11-16%).

3. Challenges: 
   - Low reactivity of propane with SO2
   - Poor selectivity to propylene
   - Potential for combustion products

4. Byproduct formation: The literature doesn't specify byproducts for propane, but for other hydrocarbons, it mentions the formation of thiophenes, carbon oxides, and coke.

5. Areas for future research:
   - Developing catalysts that can activate propane more effectively with SO2
   - Improving selectivity towards propylene
   - Minimizing combustion and undesired side reactions
   - Exploring the impact of reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed ratios) on propane dehydrogenation with SO2

6. Catalyst design: The literature suggests that metal phosphates and sulfides are generally good catalysts for oxidation with SO2. Future research could focus on tailoring these catalyst types for propane dehydrogenation.

7. Process optimization: Given the endothermic nature of SO2 oxidation reactions mentioned in the literature, heat management and reactor design could be key areas for process optimization.

While the literature doesn't provide direct comparisons to conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation, it suggests that SO2 might not offer significant advantages over conventional oxidants like O2 for this specific reaction, given its poor performance with propane. However, more research would be needed to draw definitive conclusions about the relative effectiveness of H2S, S2, and SO2 compared to conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation.

文献没有直接比较H2S、S2和SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些关于SO2作为各种碳氢化合物氧化剂的见解，这些可以用来推断对丙烷脱氢的潜在影响：

1. 有效性：与其他碳氢化合物相比，SO2似乎对丙烷脱氢的效果较差。文献报道，使用SO2作为丙烷的氧化剂时，反应速率非常慢，丙烯的选择性很低。

2. 产率：鉴于报道的选择性较低（30-54%）和转化率较低（11-16%），使用SO2作为氧化剂从丙烷得到的丙烯产率可能很低。

3. 挑战：
   - 丙烷与SO2的反应活性低
   - 丙烯的选择性差
   - 可能产生燃烧产物

4. 副产物形成：文献没有具体说明丙烷的副产物，但对于其他碳氢化合物，它提到了噻吩、碳氧化物和焦炭的形成。

5. 未来研究领域：
   - 开发能更有效地用SO2活化丙烷的催化剂
   - 提高对丙烯的选择性
   - 最小化燃烧和不需要的副反应
   - 探索反应条件（温度、压力、进料比）对SO2丙烷脱氢的影响

6. 催化剂设计：文献表明，金属磷酸盐和硫化物通常是SO2氧化的良好催化剂。未来的研究可以集中在为丙烷脱氢定制这些类型的催化剂。

7. 工艺优化：考虑到文献中提到的SO2氧化反应的吸热性质，热量管理和反应器设计可能是工艺优化的关键领域。

虽然文献没有提供与丙烷脱氢常规氧化剂的直接比较，但它表明SO2可能不会为这种特定反应提供比常规氧化剂（如O2）更显著的优势，因为它对丙烷的性能很差。然而，需要更多的研究才能得出关于H2S、S2和SO2相对于常规氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的相对有效性的确定性结论。
