[1] "The catalytic oxidation of a range of compounds, using sulfur dioxide as the oxidant, over a variety of catalysts has been examined."

[2] "Selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion."

[3] "Reaction of this compound is very slow and not selective; the main products are those of complete combustion. Propylene was the only noncombustion product found."

[4] "With calcium-nickel phosphate (GHSV = 90) at 550C, selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion. With molybdenum sulfide (GHSV = 370 after 100 min and 60 min, respectively) at 500C, selectivity to propylene was 54% at 11% conversion and 30% at 16% conversion."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does offer some insights into the use of SO2 as an oxidant for this reaction.

Using SO2 as an oxidant for propane oxidation resulted in very low propylene yields. The selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion using a calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst at 550°C. With a molybdenum sulfide catalyst at 500°C, the selectivity to propylene was slightly better at 54%, but at a much lower conversion of 11%.

The main challenge associated with using SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation appears to be the high tendency for complete combustion. The literature mentions that the main products are those of complete combustion, with propylene being the only non-combustion product found.

The study does not provide information on the use of H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP, nor does it compare SO2 with conventional oxidants like O2 for this specific reaction.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process for ODHP using sulfur-based oxidants could include:

1. Developing catalysts that can suppress complete combustion and improve selectivity towards propylene.
2. Investigating the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S and S2 for ODHP.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, space velocity) to enhance propylene yield.
4. Studying the mechanism of propane activation and propylene formation using sulfur-based oxidants to guide catalyst design.
5. Addressing potential issues related to catalyst deactivation and regeneration when using sulfur-based oxidants.

It's important to note that the information provided in the literature is limited, and a more comprehensive study would be needed to fully address the question and make definitive comparisons between different oxidants for ODHP.

文献没有对不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯方面进行全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用SO2作为这种反应的氧化剂的见解。

使用SO2作为丙烷氧化的氧化剂产生的丙烯收率非常低。在550°C下使用钙-镍磷酸盐催化剂时，丙烯的选择性仅为14%，丙烷转化率为31%。使用钼硫化物催化剂在500°C下，丙烯的选择性略有改善，达到54%，但转化率大大降低至11%。

使用SO2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的主要挑战似乎是完全燃烧的倾向很高。文献提到，主要产物是完全燃烧的产物，丙烯是唯一发现的非燃烧产物。

该研究没有提供关于使用H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息，也没有将SO2与传统氧化剂（如O2）进行比较。

未来研究改进催化剂设计和优化使用硫基氧化剂的ODHP整体过程的关键领域可能包括：

1. 开发能够抑制完全燃烧并提高丙烯选择性的催化剂。
2. 研究其他硫基氧化剂（如H2S和S2）在ODHP中的潜力。
3. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、空速）以提高丙烯产率。
4. 研究使用硫基氧化剂时丙烷活化和丙烯形成的机理，以指导催化剂设计。
5. 解决使用硫基氧化剂时可能出现的催化剂失活和再生问题。

需要注意的是，文献提供的信息有限，需要进行更全面的研究才能全面回答这个问题，并对ODHP的不同氧化剂进行明确的比较。
