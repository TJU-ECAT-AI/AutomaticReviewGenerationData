          "Propane: Very slow, very poor selectivity to propylene (11% C, 54% S; 16% C, 30% S)."

"With calcium-nickel phosphate (GHSV = 90) at 550C, selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion. With molybdenum sulfide (GHSV = 370 after 100 min and 60 min, respectively) at 500C, selectivity to propylene was 54% at 11% conversion and 30% at 16% conversion."

"Reaction of this compound is very slow and not selective; the main products are those of complete combustion. Propylene was the only noncombustion product found."

"For many feeds, the sulfur dioxide oxidation system offers substantial selectivity advantages over the oxygen system. This is due mainly to a much lower susceptibility to combustion and a lack of direct incorporation of heteroatoms in the feed molecule."

          The literature provides some insights into the use of SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, but does not offer a comprehensive comparison with H2S, S2, or conventional oxidants like oxygen.

Effectiveness and Propylene Yield:
SO2 appears to be less effective than conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. The reaction with SO2 is described as "very slow and not selective". Propylene yields are generally low:
- With calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst: 14% selectivity at 31% propane conversion
- With molybdenum sulfide catalyst: 54% selectivity at 11% conversion, and 30% selectivity at 16% conversion

Challenges:
1. Low reactivity of propane with SO2
2. Poor selectivity to propylene
3. High tendency for complete combustion
4. Potential catalyst deactivation due to coke formation

Byproduct Formation:
The main byproducts appear to be combustion products, likely CO2 and water. Propylene was the only non-combustion product reported.

Comparison with Conventional Oxidants:
While SO2 shows poor performance for propane, it offers selectivity advantages over oxygen for many other hydrocarbon feeds. This is attributed to lower susceptibility to combustion and lack of direct heteroatom incorporation.

Future Research Areas:
1. Developing more selective catalysts that can suppress complete combustion
2. Improving propane activation and conversion while maintaining selectivity
3. Investigating reaction mechanisms to understand SO2's poor performance with propane
4. Exploring potential synergies between SO2 and other oxidants or promoters
5. Studying H2S and S2 as alternative sulfur-based oxidants for ODHP
6. Addressing catalyst deactivation issues

It's important to note that more comprehensive studies are needed to fully assess the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP and make definitive comparisons with conventional oxidants.

          文献提供了一些关于使用SO2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的见解，但没有与H2S、S2或传统氧化剂（如氧气）进行全面比较。

有效性和丙烯产率：
SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂似乎比传统氧化剂效果差。使用SO2的反应被描述为"非常缓慢且不选择性"。丙烯产率普遍较低：
- 使用钙-镍磷酸盐催化剂：31%丙烷转化率下，选择性为14%
- 使用硫化钼催化剂：11%转化率下，选择性为54%；16%转化率下，选择性为30%

挑战：
1. 丙烷与SO2的反应活性低
2. 对丙烯的选择性差
3. 完全燃烧的倾向性高
4. 由于焦炭形成可能导致催化剂失活

副产物形成：
主要副产物似乎是燃烧产物，可能是CO2和水。报告中唯一的非燃烧产物是丙烯。

与传统氧化剂的比较：
虽然SO2对丙烷表现不佳，但对许多其他碳氢化合物原料，它比氧气具有选择性优势。这归因于较低的燃烧倾向和缺乏直接的杂原子掺入。

未来研究方向：
1. 开发更具选择性的催化剂，能够抑制完全燃烧
2. 提高丙烷活化和转化率，同时保持选择性
3. 研究反应机理，以了解SO2对丙烷表现不佳的原因
4. 探索SO2与其他氧化剂或促进剂之间的潜在协同作用
5. 研究H2S和S2作为ODHP的替代硫基氧化剂
6. 解决催化剂失活问题

需要注意的是，需要更全面的研究来充分评估硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的潜力，并与传统氧化剂进行明确的比较。
