[1] "Propane conversion (%) 20 40 80 Butadiene selectivity (%) 90 90 85 Isoprene selectivity (70) 73 62 36"

[2] "The reduced selectivity for this second reaction is chiefly due to the rapid complete oxidation of the isoprene formed."

[3] "Propane Reaction of this compound is very slow and not selective; the main products are those of complete combustion. Propylene was the only noncombustion product found."

[4] "With calcium-nickel phosphate (GHSV = 90) at 550C, selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion. With molybdenum sulfide (GHSV = 370 after 100 min and 60 min, respectively) at 500C, selectivity to propylene was 54% at 11% conversion and 30% at 16% conversion."

The literature does not directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. However, it does provide some information on SO2 as an oxidant for propane, which can be contrasted with conventional oxidants:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 appears to be less effective than conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. The reaction with SO2 is described as "very slow and not selective", with propylene being the only non-combustion product.

2. Propylene yield: With SO2, propylene yields are generally low. Using calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst, selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion. With molybdenum sulfide catalyst, selectivity reached 54% but at very low conversion (11%).

3. Challenges: The main challenge with SO2 as an oxidant for propane is the high tendency for complete combustion. This results in low selectivity to the desired propylene product.

4. Byproduct formation: The main byproducts appear to be combustion products, likely CO2 and water.

5. Areas for future research: Based on the information provided, key areas for future research could include:
   - Developing more selective catalysts that can minimize complete combustion
   - Exploring ways to increase propane conversion while maintaining selectivity
   - Investigating the reaction mechanisms to understand why SO2 is less effective for propane compared to other hydrocarbons

It's important to note that the document doesn't provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation, so a full comparison cannot be made. More research would be needed to fully address the question and compare all the mentioned sulfur-based oxidants.

文献没有直接比较H2S、S2和SO2作为丙烷脱氢制丙烯的氧化剂。但是，它提供了一些关于SO2作为丙烷氧化剂的信息，可以与传统氧化剂进行对比：

1. 有效性：SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂似乎比传统氧化剂效果差。使用SO2的反应被描述为"非常缓慢且不选择性"，丙烯是唯一的非燃烧产物。

2. 丙烯产率：使用SO2时，丙烯产率普遍较低。使用钙-镍磷酸盐催化剂时，在31%的丙烷转化率下，丙烯的选择性仅为14%。使用硫化钼催化剂时，选择性达到54%，但转化率很低（11%）。

3. 挑战：使用SO2作为丙烷氧化剂的主要挑战是完全燃烧的倾向性高。这导致目标产物丙烯的选择性低。

4. 副产物形成：主要副产物似乎是燃烧产物，可能是CO2和水。

5. 未来研究方向：根据提供的信息，未来研究的关键领域可能包括：
   - 开发更具选择性的催化剂，以最大程度地减少完全燃烧
   - 探索提高丙烷转化率的同时保持选择性的方法
   - 研究反应机理，以了解为什么SO2对丙烷的效果不如其他烃类

需要注意的是，文献没有提供关于H2S或S2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的信息，因此无法进行完整的比较。需要更多的研究来全面回答这个问题，并比较所有提到的硫基氧化剂。
