The literature does not provide a direct comparison between sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) and conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does offer some insights into the use of SO2 as an oxidant for propane.

The document indicates that using SO2 as an oxidant for propane results in very slow reaction rates and poor selectivity to propylene. Specifically, it reports propylene selectivity of 54% at 11% conversion and 30% selectivity at 16% conversion. These results suggest that SO2 is not an effective oxidant for ODHP.

The literature does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP, nor does it compare these sulfur-based oxidants to conventional oxidants like oxygen. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about their relative effectiveness or impact on propylene yield.

Regarding challenges, the low conversion and poor selectivity observed with SO2 are significant issues that would need to be addressed. The document does not mention specific byproduct formation for propane oxidation with SO2, but it does discuss the formation of thiophenes and combustion products in other reactions using SO2 as an oxidant.

For future research, key areas to improve catalyst design and optimize the process would likely include:

1. Developing catalysts that can increase the reaction rate and selectivity for propylene when using SO2 as an oxidant.
2. Investigating the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S and S2 for ODHP.
3. Studying the reaction mechanisms to understand why SO2 performs poorly in ODHP and how to overcome these limitations.
4. Exploring combinations of sulfur-based and conventional oxidants to potentially enhance overall performance.

It's important to note that the information provided is limited, and more comprehensive studies would be needed to fully assess the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP.

该文献没有直接比较硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯方面的效果。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用SO2作为丙烷氧化剂的见解。

文献指出，使用SO2作为丙烷的氧化剂会导致反应速率非常慢，对丙烯的选择性也很差。具体来说，它报告了在11%转化率下丙烯选择性为54%，在16%转化率下选择性为30%。这些结果表明SO2不是ODHP的有效氧化剂。

文献没有提供关于H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息，也没有将这些硫基氧化剂与氧气等传统氧化剂进行比较。因此，我们无法得出关于它们相对效能或对丙烯产率影响的结论。

关于挑战，使用SO2观察到的低转化率和差选择性是需要解决的重大问题。文档没有提到使用SO2进行丙烷氧化的具体副产品形成，但确实讨论了在使用SO2作为氧化剂的其他反应中形成噻吩和燃烧产物。

对于未来的研究，改进催化剂设计和优化过程的关键领域可能包括：

1. 开发能够在使用SO2作为氧化剂时提高反应速率和丙烯选择性的催化剂。
2. 研究其他硫基氧化剂如H2S和S2在ODHP中的潜力。
3. 研究反应机理，以了解SO2在ODHP中表现不佳的原因以及如何克服这些限制。
4. 探索硫基氧化剂和传统氧化剂的组合，以可能提高整体性能。

需要注意的是，提供的信息有限，需要更全面的研究才能充分评估硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的潜力。

The literature does not directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. However, it does provide some insights on SO2 as an oxidant for various hydrocarbons, which can be used to infer potential impacts on propane dehydrogenation:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 appears to be less effective for propane dehydrogenation compared to other hydrocarbons. The literature reports very slow reaction rates and poor selectivity to propylene when using SO2 as an oxidant for propane.

2. Yield: The propylene yield from propane using SO2 as an oxidant is likely to be low, given the reported poor selectivity (30-54%) and low conversion (11-16%).

3. Challenges: 
   - Low reactivity of propane with SO2
   - Poor selectivity to propylene
   - Potential for combustion products

4. Byproduct formation: The literature doesn't specify byproducts for propane, but for other hydrocarbons, it mentions the formation of thiophenes, carbon oxides, and coke.

5. Areas for future research:
   - Developing catalysts that can activate propane more effectively with SO2
   - Improving selectivity towards propylene
   - Minimizing combustion and undesired side reactions
   - Exploring the impact of reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed ratios) on propane dehydrogenation with SO2

6. Catalyst design: The literature suggests that metal phosphates and sulfides are generally good catalysts for oxidation with SO2. Future research could focus on tailoring these catalyst types for propane dehydrogenation.

7. Process optimization: Given the endothermic nature of SO2 oxidation reactions mentioned in the literature, heat management and reactor design could be key areas for process optimization.

While the literature doesn't provide direct comparisons to conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation, it suggests that SO2 might not offer significant advantages over conventional oxidants like O2 for this specific reaction, given its poor performance with propane. However, more research would be needed to draw definitive conclusions about the relative effectiveness of H2S, S2, and SO2 compared to conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation.

文献没有直接比较H2S、S2和SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些关于SO2作为各种碳氢化合物氧化剂的见解，这些可以用来推断对丙烷脱氢的潜在影响：

1. 有效性：与其他碳氢化合物相比，SO2似乎对丙烷脱氢的效果较差。文献报道，使用SO2作为丙烷的氧化剂时，反应速率非常慢，丙烯的选择性很低。

2. 产率：鉴于报道的选择性较低（30-54%）和转化率较低（11-16%），使用SO2作为氧化剂从丙烷得到的丙烯产率可能很低。

3. 挑战：
   - 丙烷与SO2的反应活性低
   - 丙烯的选择性差
   - 可能产生燃烧产物

4. 副产物形成：文献没有具体说明丙烷的副产物，但对于其他碳氢化合物，它提到了噻吩、碳氧化物和焦炭的形成。

5. 未来研究领域：
   - 开发能更有效地用SO2活化丙烷的催化剂
   - 提高对丙烯的选择性
   - 最小化燃烧和不需要的副反应
   - 探索反应条件（温度、压力、进料比）对SO2丙烷脱氢的影响

6. 催化剂设计：文献表明，金属磷酸盐和硫化物通常是SO2氧化的良好催化剂。未来的研究可以集中在为丙烷脱氢定制这些类型的催化剂。

7. 工艺优化：考虑到文献中提到的SO2氧化反应的吸热性质，热量管理和反应器设计可能是工艺优化的关键领域。

虽然文献没有提供与丙烷脱氢常规氧化剂的直接比较，但它表明SO2可能不会为这种特定反应提供比常规氧化剂（如O2）更显著的优势，因为它对丙烷的性能很差。然而，需要更多的研究才能得出关于H2S、S2和SO2相对于常规氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的相对有效性的确定性结论。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) with conventional oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, it does offer some insights into the use of SO2 as an oxidant for this reaction.

Using SO2 as an oxidant for propane oxidation resulted in very low propylene yields. The selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion using a calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst at 550°C. With a molybdenum sulfide catalyst at 500°C, the selectivity to propylene was slightly better at 54%, but at a much lower conversion of 11%.

The main challenge associated with using SO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation appears to be the high tendency for complete combustion. The literature mentions that the main products are those of complete combustion, with propylene being the only non-combustion product found.

The study does not provide information on the use of H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP, nor does it compare SO2 with conventional oxidants like O2 for this specific reaction.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process for ODHP using sulfur-based oxidants could include:

1. Developing catalysts that can suppress complete combustion and improve selectivity towards propylene.
2. Investigating the potential of other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S and S2 for ODHP.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, space velocity) to enhance propylene yield.
4. Studying the mechanism of propane activation and propylene formation using sulfur-based oxidants to guide catalyst design.
5. Addressing potential issues related to catalyst deactivation and regeneration when using sulfur-based oxidants.

It's important to note that the information provided in the literature is limited, and a more comprehensive study would be needed to fully address the question and make definitive comparisons between different oxidants for ODHP.

文献没有对不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯方面进行全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用SO2作为这种反应的氧化剂的见解。

使用SO2作为丙烷氧化的氧化剂产生的丙烯收率非常低。在550°C下使用钙-镍磷酸盐催化剂时，丙烯的选择性仅为14%，丙烷转化率为31%。使用钼硫化物催化剂在500°C下，丙烯的选择性略有改善，达到54%，但转化率大大降低至11%。

使用SO2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的主要挑战似乎是完全燃烧的倾向很高。文献提到，主要产物是完全燃烧的产物，丙烯是唯一发现的非燃烧产物。

该研究没有提供关于使用H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的信息，也没有将SO2与传统氧化剂（如O2）进行比较。

未来研究改进催化剂设计和优化使用硫基氧化剂的ODHP整体过程的关键领域可能包括：

1. 开发能够抑制完全燃烧并提高丙烯选择性的催化剂。
2. 研究其他硫基氧化剂（如H2S和S2）在ODHP中的潜力。
3. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、空速）以提高丙烯产率。
4. 研究使用硫基氧化剂时丙烷活化和丙烯形成的机理，以指导催化剂设计。
5. 解决使用硫基氧化剂时可能出现的催化剂失活和再生问题。

需要注意的是，文献提供的信息有限，需要进行更全面的研究才能全面回答这个问题，并对ODHP的不同氧化剂进行明确的比较。

[1] "Attempts at reducing the coke buildup by adding oxygen to the feed have not been successful, as shown in Fig. 2. The amount of oxygen added in Fig. 2 was sufficient to lower the isoprene selectivity by about 2% without affecting the decline in activity. Increased amounts of oxygen merely resulted in further burnup."

[2] "Propane: Very slow, very poor selectivity to propylene (11% C, 54% S; 16% C, 30% S)."

[3] "Propylene: Moderately slow and unselective. Mainly combustion products."

The literature does not directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. However, it does provide some insights on SO2 as an oxidant compared to oxygen for various hydrocarbons, including propane and propylene.

For propane oxidation, SO2 shows very poor selectivity to propylene, with low conversion (11-16%) and moderate selectivity (30-54%). This suggests that SO2 is not an effective oxidant for propane dehydrogenation.

For propylene oxidation, SO2 is described as moderately slow and unselective, mainly producing combustion products. This indicates that SO2 is also not suitable for selective oxidation of propylene.

However, for many other hydrocarbon feeds, SO2 oxidation offers substantial selectivity advantages over oxygen. This is attributed to lower susceptibility to combustion and lack of direct heteroatom incorporation into the product.

The main challenge associated with SO2 as an oxidant appears to be its low activity and poor selectivity for certain reactions, particularly for smaller hydrocarbons like propane and propylene. Additionally, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a significant issue, which cannot be effectively mitigated by adding oxygen to the feed.

Future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the process should focus on:

1. Developing more active and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation using SO2.
2. Addressing catalyst deactivation issues, possibly by exploring novel catalyst compositions or regeneration methods.
3. Investigating the reaction mechanisms to understand why SO2 is less effective for smaller hydrocarbons compared to larger ones.
4. Exploring potential synergies between SO2 and other oxidants or promoters to enhance activity and selectivity.

While the document does not provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants, these could be areas for future research to compare their effectiveness against SO2 and conventional oxygen-based systems for propane dehydrogenation.

文献没有直接比较H2S、S2和SO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些关于SO2作为氧化剂与氧气相比对各种碳氢化合物（包括丙烷和丙烯）的作用的见解。

对于丙烷氧化，SO2显示出非常差的丙烯选择性，转化率低（11-16%）且选择性中等（30-54%）。这表明SO2不是丙烷脱氢的有效氧化剂。

对于丙烯氧化，SO2被描述为反应速度中等且选择性差，主要产生燃烧产物。这表明SO2也不适合选择性氧化丙烯。

然而，对于许多其他碳氢化合物原料，SO2氧化提供了比氧气更大的选择性优势。这归因于较低的燃烧倾向和缺乏直接的杂原子掺入产物中。

SO2作为氧化剂的主要挑战似乎是其对某些反应的低活性和差选择性，特别是对丙烷和丙烯等较小的碳氢化合物。此外，由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个重要问题，通过向进料中添加氧气无法有效缓解这个问题。

未来改进催化剂设计和优化工艺的研究应该集中在：

1. 开发更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂，用于SO2丙烷脱氢。
2. 解决催化剂失活问题，可能通过探索新型催化剂组成或再生方法。
3. 研究反应机理，以了解为什么SO2对较小的碳氢化合物的效果不如较大的碳氢化合物。
4. 探索SO2与其他氧化剂或促进剂之间的潜在协同作用，以提高活性和选择性。

虽然文档没有提供关于H2S或S2作为氧化剂的信息，但这些可能是未来研究的方向，以比较它们与SO2和传统氧气系统在丙烷脱氢中的有效性。

The literature does not directly compare H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. However, it does provide some information on SO2 as an oxidant for propane, which can be contrasted with conventional oxidants:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 appears to be less effective than conventional oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. The reaction with SO2 is described as "very slow and not selective", with propylene being the only non-combustion product.

2. Propylene yield: With SO2, propylene yields are generally low. Using calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst, selectivity to propylene was only 14% at 31% propane conversion. With molybdenum sulfide catalyst, selectivity reached 54% but at very low conversion (11%).

3. Challenges: The main challenge with SO2 as an oxidant for propane is the high tendency for complete combustion. This results in low selectivity to the desired propylene product.

4. Byproduct formation: The main byproducts appear to be combustion products, likely CO2 and water.

5. Areas for future research: Based on the information provided, key areas for future research could include:
   - Developing more selective catalysts that can minimize complete combustion
   - Exploring ways to increase propane conversion while maintaining selectivity
   - Investigating the reaction mechanisms to understand why SO2 is less effective for propane compared to other hydrocarbons

It's important to note that the document doesn't provide information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for propane dehydrogenation, so a full comparison cannot be made. More research would be needed to fully address the question and compare all the mentioned sulfur-based oxidants.
