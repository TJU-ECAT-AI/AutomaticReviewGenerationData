[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[3] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to H2S and H2O, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, based on the available information:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is shown to increase the overall rate of propane conversion compared to conventional dehydrogenation. However, it significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation.

2. Propylene yield: With SO2, the selectivity to propylene decreased from 93.1% to 20.6% at similar conversion rates, indicating a lower propylene yield compared to conventional dehydrogenation.

3. Challenges: 
   - Byproduct formation: The use of SO2 leads to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as H2S, H2O, and CO2.
   - Selectivity: There is a significant decrease in selectivity towards propylene when using SO2.
   - Catalyst activity: The catalyst showed high initial activity but experienced changes over time, suggesting potential deactivation issues.

4. Future research areas:
   - Improving catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propylene while maintaining high conversion rates.
   - Understanding the mechanism of SO2 interaction with the catalyst and propane to minimize unwanted side reactions.
   - Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants.
   - Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., H2S, S2) mentioned in the literature but not extensively studied in this particular experiment.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare SO2 with other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2 in ODHP. Further research is needed to fully assess the relative effectiveness of these different oxidants and optimize the overall process.

根据现有文献，无法全面比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的有效性。但是，基于可用信息：

1. 有效性：二氧化硫(SO2)被证明可以提高丙烷转化的总体速率，相比于传统脱氢。然而，它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。

2. 丙烯产率：使用SO2时，在相似的转化率下，丙烯的选择性从93.1%降至20.6%，表明与传统脱氢相比，丙烯产率较低。

3. 挑战：
   - 副产物形成：使用SO2会导致不需要的副产物如H2S、H2O和CO2的形成。
   - 选择性：使用SO2时，对丙烯的选择性显著降低。
   - 催化剂活性：催化剂显示出较高的初始活性，但随时间发生变化，暗示可能存在失活问题。

4. 未来研究方向：
   - 改进催化剂设计，以提高对丙烯的选择性，同时保持高转化率。
   - 理解SO2与催化剂和丙烷的相互作用机理，以最小化不需要的副反应。
   - 研究催化剂在硫基氧化剂存在下的长期稳定性。
   - 探索文献中提到但在本实验中未深入研究的其他硫基氧化剂（如H2S、S2）。

文献没有提供足够的信息来比较SO2与其他硫基氧化剂（如H2S或S2）在ODHP中的相对效果。需要进一步研究以全面评估这些不同氧化剂的相对有效性并优化整个过程。
