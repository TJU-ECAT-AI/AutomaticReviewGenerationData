[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[3] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to H2S and H2O, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, some insights can be drawn from the available data on sulfur dioxide (SO2):

1. Impact on propylene yield: While SO2 increased the overall conversion rate of propane, it significantly decreased the selectivity to propylene. At 855 K, the selectivity to propylene dropped from 93.1% without SO2 to 20.6% with SO2 present.

2. Challenges with SO2: 
   - Decreased selectivity to propylene
   - Formation of unwanted byproducts, including H2S, H2O, and CO2
   - Initial high activity of the catalyst, which decreased over time

3. Areas for future research:
   - Improving catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propylene
   - Understanding the mechanism of SO2's impact on the reaction
   - Investigating ways to minimize byproduct formation
   - Studying catalyst stability and regeneration methods
   - Comparing SO2 with other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) and conventional oxidants

The literature does not provide specific information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP, so a direct comparison cannot be made. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants and optimize the ODHP process.

文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。然而，可以从二氧化硫(SO2)的可用数据中得出一些见解：

1. 对丙烯产率的影响：虽然SO2增加了丙烷的总体转化率，但它显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。在855 K时，丙烯的选择性从无SO2时的93.1%下降到有SO2存在时的20.6%。

2. SO2的挑战：
   - 降低了对丙烯的选择性
   - 形成不需要的副产品，包括H2S、H2O和CO2
   - 催化剂的初始活性高，但随时间降低

3. 未来研究方向：
   - 改进催化剂设计以提高对丙烯的选择性
   - 理解SO2对反应的影响机制
   - 研究最小化副产品形成的方法
   - 研究催化剂的稳定性和再生方法
   - 比较SO2与其他硫基氧化剂(H2S、S2)和传统氧化剂的效果

文献没有提供关于H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的具体信息，因此无法进行直接比较。需要进一步的研究来全面评估不同硫基氧化剂的效果并优化ODHP过程。
