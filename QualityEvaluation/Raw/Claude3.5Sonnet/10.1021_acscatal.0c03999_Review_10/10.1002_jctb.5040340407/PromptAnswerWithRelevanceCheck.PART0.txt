[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[3] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to H2S and H2O, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, some insights can be drawn from the available data on sulfur dioxide (SO2):

1. Impact on propylene yield: SO2 increased the overall rate of propane conversion but significantly decreased the selectivity to propylene. At 855 K, the selectivity to propylene dropped from 93.1% without SO2 to 20.6% with SO2 present.

2. Challenges associated with SO2:
   - Decreased selectivity to propylene
   - Formation of byproducts, including H2S, H2O, and CO2
   - Initial high activity of the catalyst, which decreased over time

3. Areas for future research:
   - Improving catalyst design to maintain high selectivity while using SO2
   - Investigating the mechanism of SO2's effect on the reaction
   - Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize byproduct formation
   - Studying catalyst stability and regeneration methods

The literature does not provide specific information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP. To fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants, further research would be needed to investigate their impacts on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and catalyst performance.

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, based on the available information:

1. Effectiveness: Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is shown to increase the overall rate of propane conversion compared to conventional dehydrogenation. However, it significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation.

2. Propylene yield: With SO2, the selectivity to propylene decreased from 93.1% to 20.6% at similar conversion rates, indicating a lower propylene yield compared to conventional dehydrogenation.

3. Challenges: 
   - Byproduct formation: The use of SO2 leads to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as H2S, H2O, and CO2.
   - Selectivity: There is a significant decrease in selectivity towards propylene when using SO2.
   - Catalyst activity: The catalyst showed high initial activity but experienced changes over time, suggesting potential deactivation issues.

4. Future research areas:
   - Improving catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propylene while maintaining high conversion rates.
   - Understanding the mechanism of SO2 interaction with the catalyst and propane to minimize unwanted side reactions.
   - Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants.
   - Exploring other sulfur-based oxidants (e.g., H2S, S2) mentioned in the literature but not extensively studied in this particular experiment.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare SO2 with other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2 in ODHP. Further research is needed to fully assess the relative effectiveness of these different oxidants and optimize the overall process.

根据现有文献，无法全面比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的有效性。但是，基于可用信息：

1. 有效性：二氧化硫(SO2)被证明可以提高丙烷转化的总体速率，相比于传统脱氢。然而，它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。

2. 丙烯产率：使用SO2时，在相似的转化率下，丙烯的选择性从93.1%降至20.6%，表明与传统脱氢相比，丙烯产率较低。

The literature primarily focuses on sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with limited information on other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2. However, we can draw some conclusions based on the provided information:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 increases the overall rate of propane conversion compared to conventional dehydrogenation. However, it significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation.

2. Propylene yield: While SO2 enhances conversion, the decreased selectivity results in a lower propylene yield compared to conventional dehydrogenation. At 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added.

3. Challenges:
   a) Selectivity: The main challenge with SO2 is the significant decrease in propylene selectivity.
   b) Byproduct formation: The reaction produces H2S, H2O, and CO2 as byproducts. CO2 formation is particularly high in the early stages of the reaction.
   c) Catalyst deactivation: The catalyst loses some activity over time due to coke formation, requiring regeneration.

4. Future research areas:
   a) Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that maintain high selectivity to propylene while using SO2 or other sulfur-based oxidants.
   b) Reaction mechanism: Further investigate the complex effect of SO2 on the dehydrogenation mechanism to understand and mitigate the selectivity decrease.
   c) Byproduct management: Explore ways to reduce or utilize byproducts, particularly CO2 and H2S.
   d) Comparative studies: Conduct research on other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) to compare their effectiveness and challenges with SO2 and conventional oxidants.
   e) Process optimization: Investigate optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst composition) to balance conversion and selectivity when using sulfur-based oxidants.

In conclusion, while SO2 shows promise in increasing propane conversion rates, significant challenges remain in terms of selectivity and byproduct formation. Future research should focus on addressing these issues through improved catalyst design and process optimization.

该文献主要关注二氧化硫（SO2）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯的氧化剂，对其他硫基氧化剂如H2S或S2的信息有限。但是，我们可以根据提供的信息得出一些结论：

1. 有效性：与常规脱氢相比，SO2增加了丙烷的整体转化率。然而，它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。

2. 丙烯产率：虽然SO2提高了转化率，但选择性降低导致丙烯产率低于常规脱氢。在855 K时，添加SO2后丙烯选择性从93.1%降至20.6%。

3. 挑战：
   a) 选择性：使用SO2的主要挑战是丙烯选择性的显著降低。
   b) 副产物形成：反应产生H2S、H2O和CO2作为副产物。在反应初期CO2的形成特别高。
   c) 催化剂失活：由于焦炭形成，催化剂随时间失去一些活性，需要再生。

4. 未来研究领域：
   a) 催化剂设计：开发在使用SO2或其他硫基氧化剂时保持高丙烯选择性的催化剂。
   b) 反应机理：进一步研究SO2对脱氢机理的复杂影响，以理解和减轻选择性降低。
   c) 副产物管理：探索减少或利用副产物的方法，特别是CO2和H2S。
   d) 比较研究：对其他硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2）进行研究，比较它们与SO2和常规氧化剂的有效性和挑战。
   e) 工艺优化：研究使用硫基氧化剂时的最佳反应条件（温度、压力、催化剂组成），以平衡转化率和选择性。

总之，虽然SO2在提高丙烷转化率方面显示出前景，但在选择性和副产物形成方面仍存在重大挑战。未来的研究应通过改进催化剂设计和工艺优化来解决这些问题。
