[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[3] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to H2S and H2O, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."

The literature primarily focuses on sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, with limited information on other sulfur-based oxidants like H2S or S2. However, we can draw some conclusions based on the provided information:

1. Effectiveness: SO2 increases the overall rate of propane conversion compared to conventional dehydrogenation. However, it significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation.

2. Propylene yield: While SO2 enhances conversion, the decreased selectivity results in a lower propylene yield compared to conventional dehydrogenation. At 855 K, propylene selectivity dropped from 93.1% to 20.6% when SO2 was added.

3. Challenges:
   a) Selectivity: The main challenge with SO2 is the significant decrease in propylene selectivity.
   b) Byproduct formation: The reaction produces H2S, H2O, and CO2 as byproducts. CO2 formation is particularly high in the early stages of the reaction.
   c) Catalyst deactivation: The catalyst loses some activity over time due to coke formation, requiring regeneration.

4. Future research areas:
   a) Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that maintain high selectivity to propylene while using SO2 or other sulfur-based oxidants.
   b) Reaction mechanism: Further investigate the complex effect of SO2 on the dehydrogenation mechanism to understand and mitigate the selectivity decrease.
   c) Byproduct management: Explore ways to reduce or utilize byproducts, particularly CO2 and H2S.
   d) Comparative studies: Conduct research on other sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2) to compare their effectiveness and challenges with SO2 and conventional oxidants.
   e) Process optimization: Investigate optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst composition) to balance conversion and selectivity when using sulfur-based oxidants.

In conclusion, while SO2 shows promise in increasing propane conversion rates, significant challenges remain in terms of selectivity and byproduct formation. Future research should focus on addressing these issues through improved catalyst design and process optimization.

该文献主要关注二氧化硫（SO2）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）生成丙烯的氧化剂，对其他硫基氧化剂如H2S或S2的信息有限。但是，我们可以根据提供的信息得出一些结论：

1. 有效性：与常规脱氢相比，SO2增加了丙烷的整体转化率。然而，它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。

2. 丙烯产率：虽然SO2提高了转化率，但选择性降低导致丙烯产率低于常规脱氢。在855 K时，添加SO2后丙烯选择性从93.1%降至20.6%。

3. 挑战：
   a) 选择性：使用SO2的主要挑战是丙烯选择性的显著降低。
   b) 副产物形成：反应产生H2S、H2O和CO2作为副产物。在反应初期CO2的形成特别高。
   c) 催化剂失活：由于焦炭形成，催化剂随时间失去一些活性，需要再生。

4. 未来研究领域：
   a) 催化剂设计：开发在使用SO2或其他硫基氧化剂时保持高丙烯选择性的催化剂。
   b) 反应机理：进一步研究SO2对脱氢机理的复杂影响，以理解和减轻选择性降低。
   c) 副产物管理：探索减少或利用副产物的方法，特别是CO2和H2S。
   d) 比较研究：对其他硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2）进行研究，比较它们与SO2和常规氧化剂的有效性和挑战。
   e) 工艺优化：研究使用硫基氧化剂时的最佳反应条件（温度、压力、催化剂组成），以平衡转化率和选择性。

总之，虽然SO2在提高丙烷转化率方面显示出前景，但在选择性和副产物形成方面仍存在重大挑战。未来的研究应通过改进催化剂设计和工艺优化来解决这些问题。
