[1] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[2] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[3] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

[4] "In the present experiments, in addition to H2S and H2O, the effluent from reaction (1) also contained carbon dioxide. This was formed in large amounts at the early stages of the reaction and then decreased with operating time, suggesting that the catalyst was quite active initially."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. However, some insights can be drawn from the available data on sulfur dioxide (SO2):

1. Impact on propylene yield: The addition of SO2 increased the overall conversion rate of propane but significantly decreased the selectivity to propylene. At 855 K, the selectivity to propylene dropped from 93.1% without SO2 to 20.6% with SO2 present.

2. Challenges associated with SO2: 
   - Decreased selectivity to propylene
   - Formation of byproducts, including H2S, H2O, and CO2
   - Initial high activity of the catalyst, which decreased over time

3. Areas for future research:
   - Improving catalyst design to enhance selectivity towards propylene
   - Investigating the mechanism of SO2's effect on the dehydrogenation process
   - Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize byproduct formation
   - Exploring the long-term stability of catalysts in the presence of sulfur-based oxidants

The literature does not provide specific information on H2S or S2 as oxidants for ODHP. To fully compare and contrast the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants, further research would be needed to study their individual impacts on propylene yield, byproduct formation, and catalyst performance.

该文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯中的效果。然而，我们可以从二氧化硫(SO2)的可用数据中得出一些见解：

1. 对丙烯产率的影响：添加SO2增加了丙烷的总体转化率，但显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。在855 K下，丙烯的选择性从无SO2时的93.1%降至有SO2存在时的20.6%。

2. 与SO2相关的挑战：
   - 对丙烯的选择性降低
   - 形成副产品，包括H2S、H2O和CO2
   - 催化剂初始活性高，随时间推移而降低

3. 未来研究方向：
   - 改进催化剂设计，提高对丙烯的选择性
   - 研究SO2对脱氢过程影响的机理
   - 优化反应条件以最小化副产品的形成
   - 探索催化剂在硫基氧化剂存在下的长期稳定性

文献没有提供关于H2S或S2作为ODHP氧化剂的具体信息。为了全面比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂的效果，需要进一步研究它们各自对丙烯产率、副产品形成和催化剂性能的影响。
