[1] "Trace amounts of sulfur (25-500 ppm) when added as H2S or thiophene increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation over platinum on magnesium aluminate."

[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."

[3] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic. Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it does discuss the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur compounds (H2S and thiophene) to the propane dehydrogenation process over platinum catalysts.

The addition of sulfur compounds (25-500 ppm) increased selectivity to olefins and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene over six 24-hour reaction cycles at 600°C. Even at concentrations as low as 25 ppm, sulfur addition changed the reaction nature, suppressing exothermic hydrogenolysis and making the overall reaction endothermic. This resulted in dramatically increased propylene yields and olefin selectivities of 90 mol%.

While this information is valuable, it does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation or compare different sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants. The study focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation with sulfur as an additive rather than an oxidant. To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on:

1. The use of S2 and SO2 as oxidants in ODHP
2. Comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants
3. Specific challenges and byproduct formation for each oxidant
4. Catalyst design optimizations for sulfur-based ODHP

The current research suggests that sulfur compounds can significantly improve propylene selectivity and yield in dehydrogenation reactions, which may be a promising avenue for future ODHP catalyst and process development.

文献并未直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的效果。但是，它确实讨论了在铂催化剂上的丙烷脱氢过程中添加微量硫化物（H2S和噻吩）的影响。

添加硫化物（25-500 ppm）增加了对烯烃的选择性，并抑制了氢解和积碳形成。在添加200 ppm H2S的情况下，在600°C下经过六个24小时反应周期后，丙烷转化率超过28 mol%，对丙烯的选择性为92-94%。即使在低至25 ppm的浓度下，硫的添加也改变了反应性质，抑制了放热的氢解反应，使整体反应变为吸热。这导致丙烯产率显著增加，烯烃选择性达到90 mol%。

虽然这些信息很有价值，但它并未直接涉及氧化脱氢或比较不同的硫基氧化剂（S2，SO2）与传统氧化剂。该研究主要关注非氧化脱氢，其中硫作为添加剂而非氧化剂。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对以下方面进行额外研究：

1. S2和SO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂的使用
2. 硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂的比较
3. 每种氧化剂的具体挑战和副产品形成
4. 硫基ODHP的催化剂设计优化

目前的研究表明，硫化物可以显著提高脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性和产率，这可能是未来ODHP催化剂和过程开发的一个有前景的方向。
