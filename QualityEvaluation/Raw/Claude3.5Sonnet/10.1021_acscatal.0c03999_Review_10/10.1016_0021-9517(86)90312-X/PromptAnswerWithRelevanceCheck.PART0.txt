The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically comparing the effectiveness of different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document primarily focuses on the role of sulfur in deactivation of Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than oxidative dehydrogenation. It does not discuss the impact of various oxidants on propylene yield, specific challenges associated with each oxidant, byproduct formation, or key areas for future research in catalyst design and process optimization for ODHP. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

[1] "Trace amounts of sulfur (25-500 ppm) when added as H2S or thiophene increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation over platinum on magnesium aluminate."

[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."

[3] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic. Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it does discuss the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur compounds (H2S and thiophene) to the propane dehydrogenation process over platinum catalysts.

The addition of sulfur compounds (25-500 ppm) increased selectivity to olefins and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene over six 24-hour reaction cycles at 600°C. Even at concentrations as low as 25 ppm, sulfur addition changed the reaction nature, suppressing exothermic hydrogenolysis and making the overall reaction endothermic. This resulted in dramatically increased propylene yields and olefin selectivities of 90 mol%.

While this information is valuable, it does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation or compare different sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants. The study focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation with sulfur as an additive rather than an oxidant. To fully answer the question, additional research would be needed on:

1. The use of S2 and SO2 as oxidants in ODHP
2. Comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants
3. Specific challenges and byproduct formation for each oxidant
4. Catalyst design optimizations for sulfur-based ODHP

The current research suggests that sulfur compounds can significantly improve propylene selectivity and yield in dehydrogenation reactions, which may be a promising avenue for future ODHP catalyst and process development.

文献并未直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的效果。但是，它确实讨论了在铂催化剂上的丙烷脱氢过程中添加微量硫化物（H2S和噻吩）的影响。

添加硫化物（25-500 ppm）增加了对烯烃的选择性，并抑制了氢解和积碳形成。在添加200 ppm H2S的情况下，在600°C下经过六个24小时反应周期后，丙烷转化率超过28 mol%，对丙烯的选择性为92-94%。即使在低至25 ppm的浓度下，硫的添加也改变了反应性质，抑制了放热的氢解反应，使整体反应变为吸热。这导致丙烯产率显著增加，烯烃选择性达到90 mol%。

虽然这些信息很有价值，但它并未直接涉及氧化脱氢或比较不同的硫基氧化剂（S2，SO2）与传统氧化剂。该研究主要关注非氧化脱氢，其中硫作为添加剂而非氧化剂。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对以下方面进行额外研究：

1. S2和SO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂的使用
2. 硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂的比较
3. 每种氧化剂的具体挑战和副产品形成
4. 硫基ODHP的催化剂设计优化

目前的研究表明，硫化物可以显著提高脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性和产率，这可能是未来ODHP催化剂和过程开发的一个有前景的方向。

The study focuses on the deactivation of Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation with H2S as an additive, rather than as an oxidant. It does not discuss ODHP or compare different oxidants.

The literature does mention that adding H2S (25-500 ppm) to the feed during propane dehydrogenation over Pt/MgAl2O4 increased propylene selectivity from 41% to 95% while maintaining conversion around 30%. However, this is for non-oxidative dehydrogenation, not ODHP.

To properly answer this question would require additional research on ODHP using various sulfur-based and conventional oxidants, their effects on propylene yield, associated challenges, and areas for improvement in catalyst design and process optimization.

给出的文献并不包含直接比较和对比不同硫基氧化剂(H2S、S2、SO2)与传统氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)制丙烯方面效果的信息。该研究主要关注在丙烷脱氢过程中添加H2S时Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂的失活情况,而非将其作为氧化剂使用。文献没有讨论ODHP或比较不同的氧化剂。

文献确实提到,在Pt/MgAl2O4上进行丙烷脱氢时,向进料中添加H2S(25-500 ppm)可以将丙烯选择性从41%提高到95%,同时保持转化率在30%左右。然而,这是针对非氧化脱氢,而非ODHP。

要正确回答这个问题,需要对使用各种硫基和传统氧化剂进行ODHP的额外研究,包括它们对丙烯产率的影响、相关挑战,以及在催化剂设计和工艺优化方面需要改进的关键领域。

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur, primarily as H2S, to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts.

However, we can draw some insights from the information provided:

1. Impact on propylene yield: The addition of trace amounts of sulfur (as H2S) significantly improved propylene yield. Without sulfur, the reaction was not selective for propylene. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion exceeded 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene.

2. Specific challenges: 
   - Without sulfur, the main reaction was hydrogenolysis, producing methane and coke as primary products.
   - The presence of sulfur suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation.
   - The reaction changed from exothermic (hydrogenolysis) to endothermic (dehydrogenation) with sulfur addition.

3. Key areas for future research:
   - Optimizing sulfur concentration: The study used 25-500 ppm, but further research could fine-tune this range.
   - Long-term catalyst stability: While the study showed good performance over six 24-hour cycles, longer-term effects need investigation.
   - Comparison with other sulfur compounds: The study mainly used H2S, but briefly mentioned thiophene. Further research could explore other sulfur compounds.
   - Mechanism understanding: More research is needed to fully understand how sulfur modifies the catalyst surface and reaction pathways.

It's important to note that this study focused on catalytic dehydrogenation rather than oxidative dehydrogenation. For a comprehensive comparison of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, additional research would be necessary.

该文献并未直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果。相反，它主要关注在Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂上进行丙烷催化脱氢时添加微量硫（主要是H2S）的影响。

然而，我们可以从提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 对丙烯产率的影响：添加微量硫（如H2S）显著提高了丙烯产率。没有硫时，反应对丙烯不具选择性。添加200 ppm H2S后，丙烷转化率超过28 mol%，丙烯选择性达到92-94%。

2. 特定挑战：
   - 没有硫时，主要反应是氢解，主要产物是甲烷和焦炭。
   - 硫的存在抑制了氢解和焦炭形成。
   - 添加硫后，反应从放热（氢解）变为吸热（脱氢）。

3. 未来研究的关键领域：
   - 优化硫浓度：研究使用了25-500 ppm，但需要进一步研究以精确调整这个范围。
   - 长期催化剂稳定性：虽然研究显示在六个24小时循环中表现良好，但需要研究更长期的影响。
   - 与其他硫化合物的比较：研究主要使用H2S，但简短提到了噻吩。进一步研究可以探索其他硫化合物。
   - 机理理解：需要更多研究以充分理解硫如何修饰催化剂表面和反应途径。

需要注意的是，这项研究主要关注催化脱氢而非氧化脱氢。要全面比较硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的效果，还需要进行额外的研究。

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur, primarily as H2S, to the propane dehydrogenation process over Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts.

The study shows that adding small amounts of H2S (25-500 ppm) significantly improves propylene yield and selectivity compared to sulfur-free conditions. H2S addition suppresses undesirable hydrogenolysis and coke formation reactions, leading to higher propylene yields. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion over 28 mol% with 92-94% propylene selectivity was achieved at 600°C.

While the study doesn't discuss specific challenges or byproduct formation associated with sulfur-based oxidants, it notes that temperatures of 600°C or higher are required for reasonable propylene yields. The research also doesn't compare H2S to other sulfur compounds like S2 or SO2 for ODHP.

Key areas for future research based on this study could include:
1. Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) for ODHP
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration and reaction conditions
3. Studying long-term catalyst stability and deactivation mechanisms
4. Exploring different catalyst compositions to further enhance propylene yield and selectivity
5. Investigating the reaction mechanism to better understand how sulfur improves the process

这篇文献并未直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果。相反，它主要关注在Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢过程中添加微量硫（主要是H2S）的影响。

研究表明，添加少量H2S（25-500 ppm）与无硫条件相比，显著提高了丙烯的产率和选择性。H2S的添加抑制了不良的氢解和积碳反应，从而提高丙烯产率。在600°C下，添加200 ppm H2S可实现超过28 mol%的丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性达92-94%。

虽然研究没有讨论与硫基氧化剂相关的具体挑战或副产物形成，但指出需要600°C或更高的温度才能获得合理的丙烯产率。该研究也没有比较H2S与其他硫化物（如S2或SO2）在ODHP中的效果。

基于这项研究，未来研究的关键领域可能包括：
1. 研究其他硫基氧化剂（S2、SO2）在ODHP中的应用
2. 优化硫浓度和反应条件
3. 研究长期催化剂稳定性和失活机理
4. 探索不同的催化剂组成，以进一步提高丙烯产率和选择性
5. 研究反应机理，以更好地理解硫如何改善该过程
