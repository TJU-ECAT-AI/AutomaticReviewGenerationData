[1] "Trace amounts of sulfur (25-500 ppm) when added as H2S or thiophene increased selectivity to olefin and suppressed both hydrogenolysis and coke formation over platinum on magnesium aluminate."

[2] "With addition of 200 ppm sulfur as H2S, for example, propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with 92-94% selectivity to propylene was maintained over six 24-h reaction cycles at 600C."

[3] "In propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 600C or higher must be employed in order to obtain reasonable yields of propylene."

[4] "The addition of sulfur in concentrations as low as 25 ppm changed the nature of the reaction. The exothermic hydrogenolysis reaction was suppressed and the overall reaction became endothermic. Yields of propylene increased dramatically and olefin selectivities of 90 mol% were obtained."

The literature does not directly compare different sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, SO2) with conventional oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the effects of adding trace amounts of sulfur, primarily as H2S, to the propane dehydrogenation process over Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts.

The study shows that adding small amounts of H2S (25-500 ppm) significantly improves propylene yield and selectivity compared to sulfur-free conditions. H2S addition suppresses undesirable hydrogenolysis and coke formation reactions, leading to higher propylene yields. With 200 ppm H2S, propane conversion over 28 mol% with 92-94% propylene selectivity was achieved at 600°C.

While the study doesn't discuss specific challenges or byproduct formation associated with sulfur-based oxidants, it notes that temperatures of 600°C or higher are required for reasonable propylene yields. The research also doesn't compare H2S to other sulfur compounds like S2 or SO2 for ODHP.

Key areas for future research based on this study could include:
1. Investigating other sulfur-based oxidants (S2, SO2) for ODHP
2. Optimizing sulfur concentration and reaction conditions
3. Studying long-term catalyst stability and deactivation mechanisms
4. Exploring different catalyst compositions to further enhance propylene yield and selectivity
5. Investigating the reaction mechanism to better understand how sulfur improves the process

这篇文献并未直接比较不同的硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2、SO2）与常规氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的效果。相反，它主要关注在Pt/MgAl2O4催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢过程中添加微量硫（主要是H2S）的影响。

研究表明，添加少量H2S（25-500 ppm）与无硫条件相比，显著提高了丙烯的产率和选择性。H2S的添加抑制了不良的氢解和积碳反应，从而提高丙烯产率。在600°C下，添加200 ppm H2S可实现超过28 mol%的丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性达92-94%。

虽然研究没有讨论与硫基氧化剂相关的具体挑战或副产物形成，但指出需要600°C或更高的温度才能获得合理的丙烯产率。该研究也没有比较H2S与其他硫化物（如S2或SO2）在ODHP中的效果。

基于这项研究，未来研究的关键领域可能包括：
1. 研究其他硫基氧化剂（S2、SO2）在ODHP中的应用
2. 优化硫浓度和反应条件
3. 研究长期催化剂稳定性和失活机理
4. 探索不同的催化剂组成，以进一步提高丙烯产率和选择性
5. 研究反应机理，以更好地理解硫如何改善该过程
