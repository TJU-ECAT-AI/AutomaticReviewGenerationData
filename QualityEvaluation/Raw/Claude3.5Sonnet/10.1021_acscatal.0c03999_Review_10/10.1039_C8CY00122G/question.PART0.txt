Halogen type as a selectivity switch in catalysed alkane 
oxyhalogenation 
Guido Zichittella,a Begoa Purtolas,a Vladimir Paunovi,a Theresa Block,b Rainer Pttgen,b and 
Javier Prez-Ramreza* 
Catalysed alkane oxyhalogenation has recently been demonstrated as an attractive route for the selective 
functionalisation of natural gas into commodity chemicals such as alkyl halides or olefins. Herein, we assess the role of the 
hydrogen halide on the product distribution in ethane and propane oxyhalogenation over europium oxychloride and 
europium oxybromide catalysts. While olefins are the main reaction products in oxychlorination (selectivity  95%), the 
formation of alkyl bromides (selectivity  95%) is favoured in oxybromination, particularly at low conversion levels. At high 
conversion levels, olefins are also observed, although the selectivity is generally limited ( 60%) due to the formation of 
cracking and combustion products. A comprehensive kinetic analysis of the oxyhalogenation, halogenation, and oxidative 
dehydrogenation of the alkanes as well as of the dehydrohalogenation of the alkyl halides provide insights on the complex 
reaction network, which proceeds through alkyl halide formation followed by its conversion to olefins and/or halocarbons. 
The observed selectivity differences primarily originate from (i) the halide-dependent alkane activation path, which is 
surface-driven in oxychlorination, while it mostly occurs via gas-phase halogenation in oxybromination, along with (ii) the 
preferred tendency of alkyl chlorides towards catalytic dehydrochlorination pathways opposing alkyl bromides that 
undergo further bromination routes in the gas phase. Finally, detailed characterisation corroborated the above findings 
and revealed the higher structural stability of europium oxychloride compared to the analogous oxybromide phase under 
oxyhalogenation conditions. These results deepen the understanding of the alkane oxyhalogenation chemistry on catalyst 
surfaces 
for 
the 
manufacture 
of 
valuable 
commodities.
1. Introduction 
The emerging conventional and unconventional natural gas 
reserves, which contain copious amounts of ethane and propane, 
offer a huge potential for the manufacture of value-added 
chemicals and fuels.1-3 However, less than 10% of the global natural 
gas production is used for the production of commodities, while 
3.5%, a fraction that is worth ca. 13 billion USD, is flared at oil and 
gas fields or refineries.4-6 The significant share ( 30%) of the 
worlds natural gas reserves that are located in remote and 
scattered areas and their prohibitive shipping costs to centralised 
cracking and/or reforming megaplants are among the main reasons 
for its limited use as chemical feedstock.4,7-9 This situation 
necessitates the development of alternative upgrading processes 
that can be implemented in compact plants amenable to 
decentralisation.4,8 Among various proposed routes as partial 
oxidation,10,11 
catalytic 
dehydrogenation,1 
and 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation of light alkanes,12,13 halogen-mediated pathways 
are attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of 
light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature 
and pressure.2 In addition to different halogenating agents and/or 
strategies that can be applied as molecular halogens,14,15 
dibromomethane,16 and/or molten metal halides,17 alkane 
oxyhalogenation, comprising the reaction of an alkane with O2 and 
a hydrogen halide (e.g. HCl or HBr), has been demonstrated as a 
promising strategy for the functionalisation of alkanes into light 
olefins and/or alkyl halides, both key building blocks for the 
manufacture of chemicals, polymers, and pharmaceuticals.18-24 
Intensive efforts led to the discovery of various catalytic materials 
including cerium oxide (CeO2), vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), 
titanium oxide (TiO2), and iron phosphate (FePO4)) for the selective 
( 95%) olefin production from ethane and propane via 
oxychlorination. In particular, europium oxychloride (EuOCl) 
exhibited outstanding performance, achieving single-pass yields of 
ethylene (90%) and propylene (40%) that surpass any existing olefin 
production technology.22 Similarly, throughout several materials 
investigated, europium oxybromide (EuOBr) has been disclosed as 
the best catalyst for methane oxybromination to methyl bromide 
reported to date.23 Despite these results, only few studies have 
tackled ethane and, especially, propane oxybromination. In 
essence, FeCl3-based and (VO)2P2O7 catalysts have been discovered, 
showing preferential formation of bromoalkanes ( 90% and  85% 
selectivity to C2H5Br, respectively) instead of the corresponding

olefins ( 20% and  65% selectivity to ethylene, respectively),24,25 
contrasting the observations gathered in alkane oxychlorination. 
Nevertheless, these studies were confined to a single type of 
hydrogen halide and lacked of detailed kinetic assessments. This 
hampers not only the systematic investigation of the multiple 
pathways involved in alkane oxyhalogenation, but particularly, the 
understanding of the role of the hydrogen halide in the complex 
oxyhalogenation reaction network (Scheme 1). 
In this work, we elucidate the impact of the halogen type on the 
product distribution attained in the oxyhalogenation of C2 and C3 
alkanes over EuOCl and EuOBr catalysts, the best reported systems 
to date in ethane and propane oxychlorination and in methane 
oxybromination, respectively. The systematic evaluation of the 
oxyhalogenation, halogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation of the 
alkanes as well as of the dehydrohalogenation of the alkyl halides 
provided valuable insights into the complex reaction network and 
enabled to extract kinetic footprints of the selective olefin 
production in oxychlorination and preferred bromocarbons 
formation 
under 
oxybromination 
conditions. 
Detailed 
characterisation of the fresh and used catalysts supported the 
above results and revealed differences in structural stability that 
are dependent on both the halide type and the alkane substrate. 
2. Experimental 
Catalyst synthesis 
EuOCl and EuOBr were prepared via a two-step synthesis.22,23 First, 
the Eu2O3 precursor was obtained by dissolving Eu(NO3)36H2O 
(ABCR, 99.9%; ca. 12 g) in deionised water (ca. 20 ml), and by 
adding H2O2 (Acros Organics, 35 wt.%) to attain a molar H2O2:Eu 
ratio of 3. The obtained solution was precipitated by dropwise 
addition of aqueous NH4OH (Sigma-Aldrich, 25 vol.%) until a pH of 
10.5. The slurry was stirred for 4 h. The precipitate was separated 
by filtration, washed with deionised water, dried at 373 K for 12 h, 
and calcined in static air at 873 K for 5 h with a heating rate of 
5 K min-1. In the second step, the obtained Eu2O3 (ca. 4 g) was 
transformed into EuOCl or EuOBr by treatment in a concentrated 
HCl- or 
HBr-containing stream (25 ml STP min-1 
comprising 
HCl/HBr:O2:Ar:He = 30:15:22.7:32.5 molar ratio) at 773 K for 4 h. 
Commercial CeO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, nanopowder, 99.9%) was calcined 
in static air at 1173 K for 5 h (5 K min-1) prior to catalytic evaluation. 
 
Catalyst characterisation 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired in a PANalytical 
XPert 
PRO-MPD 
diffractometer 
using 
Cu-Kα 
radiation 
(λ = 0.154 nm). The data was recorded in the 10-70 2θ range with 
an angular step of 0.017 and a counting time of 0.26 s per step. 
N2 sorption at 77 K was assessed in a Micromeritics TriStar II 
analyser. Prior to the measurements, the samples were evacuated 
at 573 K for 3 h. The carbon content in the catalysts was 
determined by a LECO TruSpec Micro analyser. To quantify the 
halogen content in the catalysts, the samples were treated by the 
Schniger oxidation method. The resulting combustion products 
were absorbed in a NaOH solution, and subsequently quantified by 
ion chromatography. High resolution transmission electron 
microscopy was performed using a FEI Tecnai F30 FEG microscope 
equipped with a field emission gun and operated at 300 kV. The 
solid was dispersed in ethanol and a few drops of the suspension 
were deposited onto a perforated carbon foil supported on a 
 
Scheme 1 Simplified reaction network in ethane oxyhalogenation, involving 
consecutive halogenation (green arrows), dehydrohalogenation (light blue arrows), 
oxidation (red and violet arrows for halocarbons and non-halogenated 
hydrocarbons, respectively), oxidative dehydrogenation (grey arrow), and 
decomposition (black arrows) reactions.

copper grid. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a WITec 
CRM200 confocal Raman microscope using a 532 nm laser with 
40 mW power, a 100× objective lens with numerical aperture 
NA = 0.9 (Nikon Plan), and a fibre-coupled grating spectrometer 
(2400 lines per mm), attaining a spectral resolution of 0.7 cm-1. 
Temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) was 
performed in a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 analyser. First, the 
solid was loaded into a U-shaped quartz micro-reactor, pretreated 
in He (20 cm3 min-1) at 473 K for 1 h, and cooled to 323 K. The 
H2-TPR analysis was carried out in 5 vol.% of H2 in N2 (20 cm3 min-1), 
ramping the temperature from 323 K to 1273 K at a heating rate of 
10 K min-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted 
using 
a 
PHI 
Quantum 
2000 
(Physical 
Electronics) 
X-ray 
photoelectron spectrometer featuring monochromatic Al-Kα 
radiation, generated from an electron beam operated at 15 kV and 
100 W. The samples were firmly pressed onto indium foil patches, 
which were then mounted onto a sample plate and introduced into 
the spectrometer. The analysis was conducted at 5×10-7 Pa, with an 
average take off angle of 45 and a pass energy of 23.5 eV. Charge 
compensation during the measurement was achieved using a cool 
cathode electron flood source (1.2 eV) and low energy (10 eV) 
Ar+ ions. The spectra were then shifted by aligning the main 
component of the C 1s core level spectra to 285 eV. Surface 
elemental concentrations were determined in atomic percent using 
the measured photoelectron peak areas after Shirley background 
subtraction and the built-in sensitivity factors for calculation. 151Eu 
Mssbauer spectroscopy was conducted at 78 K, achieved with a 
liquid nitrogen-bath cryostat, and using a 151Sm:EuF3 source, kept at 
room temperature. The measurements were performed at 
21.53 keV and 130 MBq, corresponding to 2% of the total activity of 
the europium source. The samples were enclosed in small PVC 
containers with a thickness corresponding to about 10 mg of the 
Mssbauer-active element cm-2. The spectra were fitted with the 
Normos-90 software package.26 
 
Catalytic testing 
The catalytic tests were performed at ambient pressure in a 
continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor set-up.21,22 The gases C2H6 
(PanGas, purity 3.5), C3H8 (50 mol.% in He 5.0), C2H4 (PanGas, 
20 mol.% in He 5.0), C3H6 (PanGas, 10 mol.% in He 5.0), HCl (Air 
Liquide, purity 2.8, anhydrous), HBr (Air Liquide, purity 2.8, 
anhydrous), C2H5Cl (PanGas, 5 mol.% in He 5.0), Cl2 (PanGas, 
purity 5.0), O2 (PanGas, purity 5.0), Ar (PanGas, purity 5.0) 
(internal standard), and He (PanGas, purity 5.0) (carrier gas) 
were dosed by digital mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) to 
achieve a desired feed composition at a total volumetric flow, 
FT, of 6 L STP h-1. The liquids C2H5Br (Acros Organics, 98%), 
1-C3H7Cl (Fluka, 97%), 1-C3H7Br (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), and Br2 
(Acros Organics, 99.6%) were vaporised in the carrier gas 
stream as detailed elsewhere.21,22 A quartz reactor (10 mm 
internal diameter) was loaded with the catalyst (catalyst 
weight, Wcat = 1 g, particle size, dp = 0.4-0.6 mm), and placed in 
an electrical oven. A K-type thermocouple fixed in a coaxial 
quartz thermowell with the tip positioned in the centre of the 
catalyst bed was used to monitor the temperature during the 
reaction. Prior to testing, the catalyst bed was heated in a He 
flow to the desired temperature (T = 423-850 K) and allowed 
to stabilise for at least 30 min before the reaction mixture was 
fed. Reactions and feed compositions studied in this work are 
collected 
in 
Table 1. 
Additional 
catalytic 
tests 
under 
differential conditions, i.e., at conversion levels of the alkane 
< 15%, were conducted to assess the activation energies of the 
different reactions involved in the oxyhalogenation network. 
The evaluation of the dimensionless moduli for internal and 
external heat and mass transfer limitations based on the 
criteria of Mears and Weisz-Prater confirmed that all the 
catalytic tests were performed in the absence of mass and 
heat transfer limitations. The down-stream lining was heated 
at 393 K to prevent the condensation of liquefiable 
unconverted reactants and products. The effluent gas stream 
was sent through impinging bottles containing an aqueous 1 M 
NaOH solution for neutralisation prior to release in the 
ventilation system. Quantification of Cl2 or Br2 was performed 
by purging a stream containing the molecular halogen through 
an aqueous 0.1 M KI solution (X2 + 3I-  2X- + I3
-; X = Cl, Br), 
followed by off-line iodometric titration (Mettler Toledo G20 
Compact Titrator) of the formed triiodide (I3
- + 2S2O3
2- 3I-
 + S4O6
2-) with an aqueous 0.01 M Na2S2O3 solution (Sigma-
Aldrich, 99.99%). Carbon-containing compounds (CH4, C2H6, 
C2H4, C3H8, C3H6, C2H5X, C2H3X, C2H4X2, 1-C3H7X, C3H5X, CO, and 
CO2) 
and Ar were quantified using an on-line gas 
chromatographer equipped with a GS-Carbon PLOT column 
coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Agilent GC 6890, 
Agilent MSD 5973N). The conversion of reactant i, Xi, (i: C2H6, 
C2H4, C3H8, C3H6, C2H5X, C3H7X, or X2) was calculated using 
Eq. 1, 
 
where ni
inlet and ni
outlet are the respective molar flows of the 
reactant i at the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively.  
The conversion of HX, XHX, in HX oxidation was calculated according 
to Eq. 2, 
 
where nHX
inlet and nX2
outlet denote the respective molar flows of HX 
and X2 at reactor inlet and outlet. 
The selectivity to product j, Sj, and the yield of product j, Yj, 
were calculated using Eqs. 3 and 4, respectively,  
 
 
where nj
outlet is the molar flow of the product j at the reactor 
outlet, while NC, j and NC, i are the number of carbon atoms in 
the compound j and i, respectively.

The error of the carbon mass balance, εC, determined using 
Eq. 6, 
 
was less than 5% in all experiments, i.e., the carbon mass 
balance was closed at  95%, unless specified otherwise. After 
the tests, the reactor was quenched to room temperature in

3. Results and discussion 
Catalyst evaluation in alkane oxyhalogenation 
The oxychlorination and oxybromination of ethane (EOC and EOB, 
respectively) and propane (POC and POB, respectively) were 
studied under variable temperature (523-850 K) over the EuOCl and 
EuOBr catalysts. Characterisation of the as-synthesised materials by 
XRD Raman, and Mssbauer spectroscopy (vide infra Fig. 4) 
revealed the characteristic reflections of EuOCl and EuOBr phases 
as well as the sole presence of trivalent europium ions in the 
structure.27,28 In the case of EuOBr, additional bands ascribed to the 
Eu2O3 phase were detected in line with its higher reducibility 
compared to EuOCl as evidenced by the H2-TPR analysis (Fig. S1 of 
the ESI) and the halved halogen content with respect to 
stoichiometric oxybromide (ca. 30 wt.%) (Table 2). These materials 
were then evaluated in the oxychlorination and oxybromination of 
ethane and propane. The impact of the reaction temperature on 
the alkane conversion and on the selectivity to the desired olefin or 
alkyl halide is presented in Fig. 1. The light-off curves in both EOB 
and POB were shifted to ca. 100 K and 200 K lower temperatures 
compared to those attained in EOC and POC, respectively. The 
comparison at similar conversion levels in ethane oxyhalogenation 
(ca. 40%) and propane oxyhalogenation (ca. 20%) revealed that 
olefins were virtually the only products generated (selectivity 
 95%) when HCl was used as the halogen source, whereas alkane 
oxybromination mainly resulted in alkyl bromide formation 
(selectivity  95%), particularly at low conversion levels. Moreover, 
while the selectivity patterns remained unaltered in the entire 
oxychlorination window, an increase in the reaction temperature

oxyhalogenation, respectively.

led to a decrease in the selectivity to bromoalkanes and a 
concomitant increment in the olefins formation in both 
oxybromination reactions (Figs. 1, S2). However, the forma\on of 
olefins remained limited in EOB ( 60% selectivity and  40% yield) 
and particularly in POB ( 27% and  13% yield), due to the 
formation of polybrominated species, as well as of cracking and 
combustion products, while in EOC and POC, olefin yields up to 75% 
and 23%, respectively, were attained (Figs. 2, 3). The favoured 
olefins formation in oxychlorination and the preferential generation 
of bromocarbons in oxybromination were also evidenced over 
other 
catalytic 
systems, 
such 
as 
(VO)2P2O7 
and 
CeO2 
(Figs. S3, S4),22,24 which suggests that the observed differences in 
product distribution upon changing the halide type are inherent to 
the oxyhalogenation reaction network, rather than to the specific 
europium oxyhalide catalysts. 
The change in the alkane substrate also revealed an influence

50-100 K lower temperatures compared to those attained in 
ethane oxyhalogenation, especially when HBr was used as the 
halogen source. Despite this, higher alkane conversion levels 
were achieved in the oxyhalogenation of ethane ( 70%) 
compared to those attained in POC ( 20%) and in POB 
( 40%). In terms of product distribution, no significant 
differences were observed between EOC and POC and olefins 
still constituted the main reaction product (selectivity  95%). 
In contrast, under POB conditions, the decrease in the 
selectivity to propyl bromide with temperature was much 
more pronounced compared to the analogous ethyl bromide, 
suggesting the higher reactivity of the former bromocarbon. In 
addition to hydrocarbons and carbon oxides, Br2 was detected 
at the reactor outlet during alkane oxybromination, especially 
below 623 K (Figs. 2b, 3b). By increasing the reaction 
temperature, the production of Br2 rapidly decreased while 
the formation of alkyl bromide simultaneously increased, 
suggesting the contribution of the produced Br2 in the alkyl 
bromide formation. Moreover, the yield of the latter product 
decreased to almost zero after reaching a maximum at 17% 
and 14% in EOB and POB, respectively. Concomitantly, the 
olefin yield increased, indicating the occurrence of a 
consecutive mechanism, in which the alkyl bromide acts as an 
intermediate that is dehydrobrominated to yield the olefin. In 
addition to ethyl bromide, dibromoethane was observed in 
EOB with a comparable volcano-type behaviour as for the 
monosubstituted ethane (Fig. 2b). Similarly, generation of vinyl 
bromide (C2H3Br) was evidenced, suggesting that C2H4Br2 can 
be also dehydrobrominated to yield C2H3Br, as depicted in 
Scheme 1. On the other hand, in EOC and POC, nor Cl2 neither 
alkyl chlorides were detected. This might suggest that either 
the olefin is generated directly from the alkane via oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
or 
that 
the 
kinetics 
of 
the 
dehydrochlorination of the alkyl chlorides is fast enough that 
these intermediates cannot be identified at the reactor outlet. 
The assessment of which of these routes are favoured in the 
oxyhalogenation environment will be the focus of the third 
section.

Catalysts characterisation 
The porosity of the samples after catalytic evaluation was assessed 
by N2 sorption analysis (Table 2). The textural properties of the 
europium oxyhalide catalysts were preserved after EOC and EOB, 
but sintering of the material was observed under propane 
oxyhalogenation conditions. The used EuOCl samples evidenced the 
characteristic reflections of this phase (Fig. 4a), as additionally 
confirmed 
by 
Raman 
spectroscopy 
(Fig. 4b). 
Furthermore, 
elemental analysis corroborated that the stoichiometric EuOCl 
phase was preserved, since the chlorine content was close to the 
theoretical value (ca. 17 wt.%) in all cases (Table 2). Conversely, the 
bromine content after EOB was lower than the stoichiometric 
amount for pure EuOBr (ca. 30 wt.%), even though EuOBr was the 
only phase evidenced (Figs. 4a, 4b), which might be due to the 
presence of well-dispersed Eu2O3 particles into the EuOBr matrix 
that could not be detected neither by XRD nor by Raman analyses. 
151Eu Mssbauer spectroscopy measurements (Fig. 4c) confirmed 
that Eu3+ species were present in the EuOCl and EuOBr samples 
after EOC and EOB, respectively, despite a small deviation in the 
isomer shifts (Table S1), suggesting variations in the europium 
electron density.

with a bromine content significantly higher than the 
theoretical value (Table 2), thus indicating the complete 
bromination of the catalyst. The latter was corroborated by 
151Eu Mssbauer spectroscopy, revealing that 18% of the 
europium present in the sample was reduced to Eu2+ (Fig. 4c). 
Still, the isomer shift of Eu2+ (Table S1) was lower than that 
observed for EuBr2 (-12.97 mm s-1),27 indicating the higher 
iconicity of the Eu2+ species present in EuOBr after POB. These 
results contrast the high stability of the EuOBr phase under 
HBr oxidation and methane oxybromination conditions.23 It is 
plausible that the catalyst surface was partially brominated 
and reduced by the bromopropanes generated during the 
reaction, resulting in the formation of the observed europium 
bromides as well as of carbon deposits as evidenced by XRD 
and elemental analysis (Table 2), respectively. The inspection 
of the transmission electron micrographs (Figs. 4d, S5, S6) 
revealed that catalytic evaluation in oxychlorination led to an 
increase in the particle size from ca. 50 nm to ca. 100 nm, 
whose oval-shaped morphology was not altered. In contrast, 
the aggregated intergrown crystals of irregular morphology 
observed in the fresh EuOBr catalyst transformed into 
oval-shaped particles upon EOB, similar to those observed in 
EuOCl, in agreement with the higher purity of the oxybromide 
phase. On the other hand, assessment of the micrographs of 
the sample after POB indicated its amorphous nature as 
revealed by a minor contribution from the crystalline phases, 
thus suggesting that the coke deposits detected over this 
catalyst (Table 2) partially mask the sample crystallinity 
(Figs. 4a, 4b). XPS analysis of the catalysts after EOC and EOB 
evidenced the simultaneous presence of Eu2+ and Eu3+ in the 
energy region of the Eu 3d transition (Figs. 5, S7),29 alluding 
that this redox couple is responsible for the catalytic 
activity.22,23 The Eu3+/Eu2+ ratio was slightly higher in the case 
of the EuOBr catalyst, which contrasted the moderately higher 
oxygen content observed after EOC (Table 3). Nevertheless, 
the more reduced surface of the EuOCl catalyst could be 
explained by the lability of chlorine, in addition to that of 
oxygen, in forming surface vacancies as observed in a previous 
study on lanthanum oxychloride.30 Both Cl 2p and Br 3d core 
level spectra exhibited the peaks attributed to metalchlorine 
and metalbromine bonds (Fig. 5), which are inherent to the 
europium oxyhalide structure. Additionally, the O 1s spectra 
exhibited two peaks for both EuOCl and EuOBr. The first one 
was detected at 528.9 eV and is ascribed to oxide-like species, 
and the second one at 538.1 eV is attributed to oxygen atoms 
that are close to electronegative chlorine and bromine atoms 
(Fig. S7).31 Finally, carbon-chlorine (CCl) and carbon-bromine 
(CBr) bonds were iden\fied over the EuOCl and EuOBr 
surfaces, respectively. The presence of these bands over EuOCl 
could indicate the interaction between the carbon-containing 
substrates, i.e., the alkane or the halogenated alkane, and the 
catalyst surface, since their assignment to coke deposits could

band could also be related to the presence of brominated 
compounds in the coke deposits detected after the catalytic 
tests (Table 2). 
 
Rationalisation of the selectivity differences 
To assess the role of the hydrogen halide in olefin formation, 
we have contrasted the performance of the europium 
oxyhalide catalysts in the oxyhalogenation and in the oxidative 
dehydrogenation (ODH) of the alkanes (Fig. 6). Both catalysts 
were virtually inactive in ODH reactions in the temperature 
window of oxyhalogenation, and the products detected were 
mainly carbon oxides with selectivity values ranging from 60% 
to 100% (Fig. S8). Indeed, the presence of the halide was 
pivotal for activity and/or selectivity to the desired product. 
As anticipated, the oxyhalogenation of alkanes might proceed 
through the formation of the alkyl halide followed by its 
dehydrohalogenation to yield the corresponding olefin, 
although the halogenating agent (i.e., molecular halogen, 
halide and/or catalyst) seems to differ depending on the halide 
type. To rationalise this phenomenon, we performed gas-
phase alkane halogenation experiments with Cl2 or Br2 over 
inert quartz particles as well as catalytic hydrogen halide 
oxidation to molecular halogen under similar reaction 
conditions to alkane oxyhalogenation (Fig. 7). In the case of 
HBr oxidation over EuOBr, Br2 generation occurred at much 
lower temperatures than alkane oxybromination (Figs. 7b, 7d), 
which explains the presence of Br2 in the low-temperature 
region of EOB and POB (Figs. 2, 3). Furthermore, the 
comparison between alkane oxybromination and gas-phase 
bromination revealed similar values for the evolution of the 
activity with the reaction temperature for both alkanes, as well 
as analogous selectivity patterns in the low temperature 
regime (Fig. S9), sugges\ng that the halogena\on step might 
primarily occur via the gas-phase reaction of the alkane with 
the Br2 generated under oxybromination conditions. Still, a 
minor contribution from pure catalytic paths to the alkane 
activation could be involved owing to the slight differences in 
the light-off curves between the oxybromination and the

bromination of the alkane and to the different values attained 
for the apparent activation energies of these reactions 
(Table 4). On the other hand, the differences in olefin 
formation at high temperature between oxybromination and 
gas-phase bromination of propane and, especially ethane, are 
due to the fact that the alkyl bromide generated in the gas-
phase is catalytically dehydrobrominated to the corresponding 
olefin in oxybromination, while this step is limited in alkane 
bromination due to the absence of the catalyst (vide infra 
Figs. 8c, 8d). These observations are in line with previous 
results attained for the oxybromination of methane over 
different catalytic systems,21-24 suggesting that the catalyst 
design criteria for this reaction might be applied to ethane and 
propane oxybromination. On the other hand, EuOCl was 
inactive in HCl oxidation, and, therefore, no Cl2 can be 
generated under oxychlorination conditions (Figs. 7a, 7c), 
suggesting that alkane activation primarily occurs over the 
catalyst surface, in agreement with theoretical studies on 
metal oxychlorides.19,30 Moreover, the presence of CCl bonds 
detected by XPS over EuOCl after EOC (Figure 5b) further 
corroborates this hypothesis.  
Once 
the 
alkyl 
halide 
is 
formed, 
it 
can 
undergo 
dehydrohalogenation to form the corresponding olefin or 
further halogenation to polyhalocarbons along with the 
possible occurrence of cracking and combustion reactions 
(Scheme 1). The preference of one route over the others will 
depend on the kinetics of each transformation. Therefore, we 
have assessed the performance of the europium oxyhalide 
catalysts in alkyl halide dehydrohalogenation, which has been 
confronted to that obtained over inert quartz particles 
(Figs. 8, S11). First, the yield of olefin formation was much 
higher than the one attained over quartz in all cases, which 
demonstrates that the dehydrohalogenation step is catalysed 
by 
europium 
oxyhalides. 
In 
addition, 
the 
catalytic 
dehydrohalogenation of alkyl chlorides occurred at similar or 
lower temperature compared to that of alkyl bromides, 
particularly in the case of ethyl halides, thus opposing the 
results attained over inert quartz particles, for which higher 
alkyl 
halide 
conversion 
levels 
were 
attained 
in 
the 
dehydrobromination. This suggests that alkyl bromides are less 
stable than alkyl chlorides, which can be explained by the 
difference in bond strength between CCl (355 kJ mol-1) and 
CBr (309 kJ mol-1),2 along with the smaller gap between the 
apparent activation energies of catalytic dehydrobromination 
and decomposition of alkyl bromides over quartz compared to 
those obtained for alkyl chlorides (Table 4). The tendency of 
bromocarbons towards decomposition was also observed over 
the catalysts, as evidenced by the error in the carbon balance 
showed by the difference between the conversion of the alkyl 
bromide and the attained olefin yield, particularly in the case 
of ethyl bromide (Figs. 8e, 8f). This limited stability restricts 
the operating window of alkane oxybromination for the 
selective production of alkyl bromides. Similarly, the lower 
stability of propyl chloride in comparison with that of ethyl 
chloride limits the temperature range for the selective 
generation of propylene to 773 K, whereas high ethylene 
yields in EOC ( 75%) can be attained up to 850 K. As 
evidenced in Fig. 8, the on-set of the dehydrochlorination of 
the 
alkyl 
chlorides 
occurred 
at 
ca. 250-300 K 
lower 
temperatures than that of alkane oxychlorination, particularly 
in the case of C3-substrates. These differences showed that 
alkyl chloride dehydrochlorination possesses much faster 
kinetics than alkane oxychlorination, thus explaining why these 
intermediates were not detected at the reactor outlet

(Figs. 1, 2). On the other hand, in the case of alkyl bromide 
dehydrobromination, the operating temperature window is 
much closer to that of oxybromination. Therefore, higher 
selectivity to alkyl bromides was attained, particularly in the 
low temperature window of this reaction (Figs. 1, 2).  
To understand the influence of the halide type on the different 
pathways that alkyl halides can undergo (Scheme 1) during 
oxyhalogenation reactions, additional dehydrohalogenation 
experiments were performed in the presence of the hydrogen 
halide and oxygen over the catalysts (Figs. 9, S12). For ethyl 
halides, ethylene, dihaloethane, and vinyl halide were 
observed as products (Figs. 9a, 9c). In the case of ethyl 
chloride, the yield of ethylene (60%) was much higher than 
that 
of 
dichloroethane 
(20%), 
indicating 
that 
the 
dehydrochlorination 
pathways 
are 
preferred 
to 
the 
polychlorination routes. In addition, the presence of 
dichloroethane at ca. 300 K lower temperature than Cl2 
evolution over EuOCl showed that this catalyst was able to 
chlorinate hydrocarbons, in agreement with the results 
presented above. Interestingly, dichloroethane was only 
detected under these conditions (Figs. 9c, S12) while it was 
not identified in the absence of HCl and O2 (Fig. 8) or in the 
presence of bare O2 (Fig. S13), which indicates that the 
presence of HCl is critical for the catalytic chlorination to 
occur. On the contrary, in case of ethyl bromide, 
dibromoethane (35% yield) was favoured over ethylene (15% 
yield), suggesting that polybromination routes are preferred to 
dehydrobromination pathways (Figs. 9c, S12). The latter 
might be due to the fact that, under these conditions, the 
formation of Br2 occurs, as the oxidation of HBr over EuOBr 
proceeds in the same temperature region (Figs. 9c). In the 
dehydrohalogenation of the propyl halides, propylene and 
carbon oxides were the only products detected (Figs. 9b, 9d). 
Similarly to ethyl chloride, propylene was the main product 
( 90% yield) when propyl chloride was used as a substrate. 
For propyl bromide, only carbon oxides were observed, 
resulting in a significant error in the carbon balance, as 
inferred by the difference between the products identified (7% 
yield) and the attained alkyl halide conversion ( 95%) at the 
highest temperature investigated (Fig. 9f). This suggests that 
alkyl bromide decomposition is favoured in the presence of 
HBr and O2 (Figs. 9e, 9f), which could explain the carbon 
deposits observed after alkane oxybromination, particularly 
after POB (Figs. 2, 3 and Table 2). 
Owing to the presence of oxygen in the reaction mixture, in 
addition to the oxidation of the alkanes (Fig. 6) and/or 
halocarbons (Fig. 9), one of the reactions that can occur under 
oxyhalogenation conditions is the oxidation of olefins. The 
assessment of the performance of the europium oxyhalide 
catalysts in the oxidation of ethylene and propylene is 
presented in Fig. S14. The catalysts were virtually inactive for 
these reactions, which together with their similar inactivity in 
the oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 6, S6) suggest that halocarbons 
are the most likely source of carbon oxides observed during 
the alkane oxyhalogenation tests.  
Finally, a graphical summary including the proposed reaction 
mechanism of alkane oxyhalogenation, comprising alkane 
halogenation and alkyl halide dehydrohalogenation steps, 
along with the main findings gathered from this study is 
provided in Fig. 10. Regardless of the alkane substrate, 
oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation, 
whereas 
oxybromination 
favours 
the 
formation 
of 
bromocarbons. One of the main reasons for this difference 
relies on the fact that the chlorination of the alkane and 
subsequent dehydrochlorination occur exclusively on the 
catalyst surface over EuOCl, whereas the alkane bromination is

mainly driven by the reaction in the gas-phase with the 
generated molecular Br2 followed by a mayor contribution 
from polyhalogenation, cracking, and combustion pathways in 
the gas-phase and limited formation of the olefin via catalytic 
dehydrobromination. In particular, the higher decomposition 
temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to their brominated 
analogues might explain the difference in coke formation 
between the oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions, as 
reported in Figs. 2 and 3. 
Conclusions 
Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over 
EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity 
and especially in the product distribution as a function of the 
halide type. Besides the ca. 200 K higher temperature 
operation 
of 
alkane 
oxychlorination 
compared 
to 
oxybromination, the former reaction led exclusively to olefins 
( 95% selectivity) in the entire operating window. This 
contrasted the preferred alkyl bromides generation (selectivity 
 95%) in the low temperature regime of oxybromination, 
which transformed into olefins, polybrominated alkanes, 
cracking, and combustion products at higher temperatures. 
Characterisation of the fresh and used catalysts revealed the 
complete 
bromination 
of 
EuOBr 
after 
propane 
oxybromination, while EuOCl remained structurally stable after 
all catalytic tests. A detailed kinetic evaluation of the 
oxyhalogenation, 
halogenation, 
and 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation 
of 
the 
alkanes 
together 
with 
the 
dehydrohalogenation of the alkyl halides provided insights on 
the preferred reaction paths governing the different selectivity 
trends in alkane oxyhalogenation, which proceeds through 
alkyl halide formation followed by its conversion to olefins 
and/or halocarbons. In particular, alkane activation occurs 
primarily on the catalyst surface in oxychlorination, while alkyl 
bromide generation proceeds via the gas-phase alkane 
bromination with the in situ produced Br2. Along with the 
favoured tendency of alkyl chlorides to undergo catalytic 
dehydrochlorination pathways and the preference of alkyl 
bromides towards further bromination routes in the gas-
phase, these findings enable to uncover the complex 
oxyhalogenation 
reaction 
network, 
and 
constitute 
an 
important step towards the development of a halogen-based 
process for efficient natural gas valorisation.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
