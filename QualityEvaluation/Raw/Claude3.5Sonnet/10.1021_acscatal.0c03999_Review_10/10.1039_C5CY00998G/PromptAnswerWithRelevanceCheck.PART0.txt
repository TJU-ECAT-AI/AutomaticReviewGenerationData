<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document primarily focuses on chromium-based catalysts using CO2 and O2 as oxidants. There is no discussion of H2S, S2, SO2 or other sulfur compounds as oxidants for ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants or discuss their impact on propylene yield, challenges, and areas for future research based solely on the information given in this document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有关于硫基氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的任何信息。该文档主要关注使用CO2和O2作为氧化剂的铬基催化剂。文中没有讨论H2S、S2、SO2或其他含硫化合物作为ODHP的氧化剂。因此,仅根据本文档中给出的信息,我无法比较硫基氧化剂与传统氧化剂,也无法讨论它们对丙烯产率的影响、挑战以及未来研究的重点领域。

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, and SO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on chromium-based catalysts using CO2 and O2 as oxidants. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for ODHP based on this specific literature. To answer this question, additional research on sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP would be required.

给定的文献中没有关于硫化氢(H2S)、二硫(S2)和二氧化硫(SO2)等含硫氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的信息。该文献主要关注使用二氧化碳和氧气作为氧化剂的铬基催化剂。因此,我无法基于这篇特定文献比较含硫氧化剂与传统氧化剂在ODHP中的效果。要回答这个问题,需要对ODHP中的含硫氧化剂进行额外的研究。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants like H2S, S2, or SO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on chromium-based catalysts using CO2, O2, or a mixture of CO2 and O2 as oxidants. Therefore, I cannot compare and contrast the effectiveness of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for ODHP based on the given information.

To properly address this question, additional research would be needed on:

1. The performance of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP reactions
2. Propylene yields achieved with H2S, S2, and SO2 as oxidants
3. Specific challenges associated with each sulfur-based oxidant
4. Byproduct formation when using sulfur-based oxidants
5. Current catalyst designs for sulfur-based ODHP
6. Key areas for improving catalysts and optimizing processes with sulfur-based oxidants

Without this information, it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between sulfur-based and conventional oxidants for ODHP or discuss the specific challenges and research needs associated with sulfur-based oxidants.

提供的文献中没有包含关于硫化氢(H2S)、二硫(S2)或二氧化硫(SO2)等含硫氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的信息。该文档主要讨论使用二氧化碳、氧气或二氧化碳和氧气混合物作为氧化剂的铬基催化剂。因此，基于给定的信息，我无法比较和对比含硫氧化剂与传统氧化剂在ODHP中的效果。

要正确回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，包括以下方面：

1. 含硫氧化剂在ODHP反应中的性能
2. 使用H2S、S2和SO2作为氧化剂时达到的丙烯产率
3. 与每种含硫氧化剂相关的具体挑战
4. 使用含硫氧化剂时的副产物形成
5. 用于含硫ODHP的当前催化剂设计
6. 改进催化剂和优化含硫氧化剂工艺的关键领域

没有这些信息，无法对ODHP中的含硫氧化剂和传统氧化剂进行有意义的比较，也无法讨论与含硫氧化剂相关的具体挑战和研究需求。
