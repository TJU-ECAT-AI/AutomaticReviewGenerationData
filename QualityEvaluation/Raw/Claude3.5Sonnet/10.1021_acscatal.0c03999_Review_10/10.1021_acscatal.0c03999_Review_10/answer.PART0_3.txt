[1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."

[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[5] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[6] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[7] "The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed."

[8] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. Each of these sulfur-based oxidants has different impacts on propylene yield and presents unique challenges:

H2S: When combined with O2, H2S can significantly improve propylene yield. For instance, using H2S + O2 with γ-Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 catalysts achieved a 30.4% propylene yield at 700°C. Even higher yields (up to 60%) were obtained using H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts. The main advantage of H2S is its ability to reduce overoxidation and improve selectivity.

S2: As a soft oxidant, S2 can reduce the overoxidation of propane compared to oxygen, particularly when used with catalysts like ZrO2. This leads to improved propylene selectivity. However, a major challenge with S2ODHP is the formation of byproducts such as CS2, which needs to be kinetically inhibited for efficient catalyst design.

SO2: While SO2 can increase propane conversion, it faces challenges in maintaining high propylene selectivity. As SO2 partial pressure increases in the feed, propylene selectivity decreases significantly (from 93.1% to 20% in one study). The main issue with SO2ODHP is the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts, resulting in low propylene yields.

Compared to conventional oxidants, these sulfur-based oxidants generally offer improved selectivity and reduced overoxidation. However, they also introduce new challenges, such as byproduct formation and the need for careful control of reaction conditions.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the process include:

1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design, particularly for S2ODHP.
2. Designing catalysts that can kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts like CS2.
3. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity, especially for SO2ODHP.
4. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts used with sulfur-based oxidants.
5. Exploring novel catalyst supports and promoters that can enhance the performance of sulfur-based ODHP processes.
6. Developing in-situ/operando characterization techniques to better understand the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms in sulfur-based ODHP.

与传统氧化剂相比，基于硫的氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出了promising的结果。这些基于硫的氧化剂对丙烯产率有不同的影响，并呈现出独特的挑战：

H2S：当与O2结合时，H2S可以显著提高丙烯产率。例如，使用H2S + O2与γ-Al2O3和V/Al2O3催化剂在700°C下实现了30.4%的丙烯产率。使用H2S促进的ODH和熔盐催化剂甚至获得了更高的产率（高达60%）。H2S的主要优势在于其能够减少过度氧化并提高选择性。

S2：作为一种软氧化剂，与氧相比，S2可以减少丙烷的过度氧化，特别是当与ZrO2等催化剂一起使用时。这导致了丙烯选择性的提高。然而，S2ODHP的一个主要挑战是副产品CS2的形成，需要通过动力学抑制来实现高效的催化剂设计。

SO2：虽然SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但在保持高丙烯选择性方面面临挑战。随着进料中SO2分压的增加，丙烯选择性显著下降（在一项研究中从93.1%降至20%）。SO2ODHP的主要问题是在大体积金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产物，导致丙烯产率低。

与传统氧化剂相比，这些基于硫的氧化剂通常提供了更高的选择性和减少的过度氧化。然而，它们也带来了新的挑战，如副产品的形成和对反应条件的精确控制需求。

未来改进催化剂设计和优化过程的关键研究领域包括：

1. 为理性催化剂设计开发结构-活性关系，特别是针对S2ODHP。
2. 设计能够动力学抑制CS2等副产品形成的催化剂。
3. 优化催化剂组成和反应条件，以平衡转化率和选择性，特别是针对SO2ODHP。
4. 研究使用硫基氧化剂的催化剂的长期稳定性和再生。
5. 探索能够增强硫基ODHP过程性能的新型催化剂载体和促进剂。
6. 开发原位/操作表征技术，以更好地理解硫基ODHP中活性位点的性质和反应机理。
