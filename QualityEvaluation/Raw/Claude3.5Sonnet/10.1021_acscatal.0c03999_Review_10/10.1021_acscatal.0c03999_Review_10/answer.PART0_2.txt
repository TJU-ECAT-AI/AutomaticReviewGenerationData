[1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. (213) Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[4] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[5] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[6] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."

[7] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants. Each of these sulfur-based oxidants has its own advantages and challenges:

H2S:
- Can improve propylene yield, especially when combined with O2
- Achieves high propylene yields (up to 60%) when used with molten salt catalysts
- Effective at short residence times, suppressing cracking reactions

S2:
- Acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane
- Can improve propylene selectivity
- Challenges include the formation of byproducts like CS2

SO2:
- Potentially an effective way to utilize this acidic gas
- However, results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts

Compared to conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants generally offer improved selectivity towards propylene and can reduce overoxidation. However, they also present specific challenges:

1. Byproduct formation: Sulfur-based byproducts such as CS2, thiol mercaptans, and elemental sulfur (S8) are observed in the reactor effluent.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that can effectively utilize these sulfur-based oxidants while minimizing unwanted side reactions is crucial.

3. Process optimization: Finding the right balance between oxidant concentration, temperature, and residence time is necessary to maximize propylene yield and selectivity.

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the overall process include:

1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design
2. Investigating ways to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, especially for S2ODHP
3. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions for each specific sulfur-based oxidant
4. Exploring novel catalyst supports and promoters to enhance selectivity and stability
5. Conducting in-depth mechanistic studies to better understand the reaction pathways and active sites involved in sulfur-mediated ODHP

By addressing these challenges and focusing on these research areas, the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP can be further realized, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes for propylene production.

2. 催化剂设计：开发能有效利用这些硫基氧化剂同时最小化不需要的副反应的催化剂至关重要。

3. 过程优化：找到氧化剂浓度、温度和停留时间之间的正确平衡，以最大化丙烯产率和选择性。

为改进催化剂设计和优化整体过程，未来研究的关键领域包括：

1. 发展结构-活性关系，用于理性催化剂设计
2. 研究动力学抑制副产品形成的方法，特别是对于S2ODHP
3. 针对每种特定硫基氧化剂优化催化剂组成和反应条件
4. 探索新型催化剂载体和助剂，以提高选择性和稳定性
5. 进行深入的机理研究，以更好地理解硫介导ODHP中涉及的反应途径和活性位点

通过解决这些挑战并专注于这些研究领域，硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的潜力可以进一步实现，可能导致更高效和选择性的丙烯生产工艺。
