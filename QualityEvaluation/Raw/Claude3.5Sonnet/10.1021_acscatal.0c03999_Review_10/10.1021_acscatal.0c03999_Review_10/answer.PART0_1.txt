[1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."

[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[5] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[6] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[7] "The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed."

[8] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. These alternative oxidants can improve propylene yield and selectivity under certain conditions.

H2S: When used in combination with O2, H2S has demonstrated significant improvements in propylene yield. For instance, H2S-promoted ODH over a molten salt catalyst achieved propylene yields of up to 60% at 705°C, which is higher than yields obtained with conventional catalysts or gas-phase reactions.

S2: As a soft oxidant, S2 has shown the ability to reduce overoxidation of propane compared to oxygen. This can lead to improved selectivity towards propylene. S2 has been particularly effective when used with metal oxide catalysts like ZrO2.

SO2: While SO2 can increase propane conversion, it faces challenges in terms of selectivity. The SO2ODHP pathway often results in low propylene yields due to the formation of COx products, especially over bulk metal oxide catalysts. Increasing SO2 partial pressure in the feed tends to decrease selectivity significantly.

Challenges associated with each oxidant:
1. H2S: Optimizing residence times to suppress cracking reactions.
2. S2: Inhibiting the formation of byproducts like CS2.
3. SO2: Controlling selectivity and minimizing COx formation.

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design.
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions for each sulfur-based oxidant.
3. Investigating novel catalyst supports and promoters to enhance selectivity and stability.
4. Exploring combinations of sulfur-based oxidants to leverage their individual strengths.
5. Addressing the formation of sulfur-containing byproducts and improving overall carbon balance.

In conclusion, while sulfur-based oxidants show promise for ODHP, significant challenges remain in optimizing selectivity, yield, and catalyst stability. Future research should focus on understanding the reaction mechanisms and developing tailored catalysts for each oxidant to fully realize their potential in propylene production.

与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出有前景的结果。在某些条件下，这些替代氧化剂可以提高丙烯产率和选择性。

H2S：当与O2结合使用时，H2S显著提高了丙烯产率。例如，在705°C下，H2S促进的ODH在熔盐催化剂上实现了高达60%的丙烯产率，这高于常规催化剂或气相反应获得的产率。

S2：作为一种软氧化剂，S2与氧气相比，显示出减少丙烷过度氧化的能力。这可以提高对丙烯的选择性。当与ZrO2等金属氧化物催化剂一起使用时，S2特别有效。

SO2：虽然SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但在选择性方面面临挑战。SO2ODHP途径通常导致丙烯产率低，这是由于COx产物的形成，特别是在块状金属氧化物催化剂上。增加进料中SO2的分压会显著降低选择性。

与每种氧化剂相关的挑战：
1. H2S：优化停留时间以抑制裂解反应。
2. S2：抑制CS2等副产物的形成。
3. SO2：控制选择性并最小化COx的形成。

未来研究的关键领域：
1. 发展结构-活性关系，用于合理的催化剂设计。
2. 优化每种硫基氧化剂的催化剂组成和反应条件。
3. 研究新型催化剂载体和促进剂，以提高选择性和稳定性。
4. 探索硫基氧化剂的组合，以利用它们各自的优势。
5. 解决含硫副产物的形成问题，并改善整体碳平衡。

总之，虽然硫基氧化剂在ODHP中显示出前景，但在优化选择性、产率和催化剂稳定性方面仍面临重大挑战。未来的研究应该集中在理解反应机理和为每种氧化剂开发定制催化剂上，以充分实现它们在丙烯生产中的潜力。
