          [1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."

[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[5] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[6] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[7] "The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed."

[8] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

[9] "Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. (234) The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions."

[10] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."

          Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants. Each oxidant has different impacts on propylene yield and selectivity:

H2S:
- Can significantly improve propylene yield, especially when combined with O2
- Achieved 30.4% propylene yield at 700°C using γ-Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 catalysts
- Up to 60% propylene yield obtained with H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts at 705°C
- Effective at short residence times, suppressing cracking reactions

S2:
- Acts as a soft oxidant, reducing overoxidation of propane
- Improves propylene yield and selectivity (73% selectivity at 650°C)
- However, conversion rates remain low (10% at 650°C)
- Gas-phase reactions dominate over catalytic reactions

SO2:
- Increases propane conversion but faces challenges in maintaining high propylene selectivity
- Selectivity decreases significantly (from 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure
- Results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts

Challenges associated with sulfur-based oxidants:
1. Formation of sulfur-based byproducts (CS2, thiol mercaptans, S8)
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity, especially for SO2
3. Kinetic inhibition of byproduct formation, particularly for S2ODHP
4. Optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst compositions for each oxidant

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing structure-activity relationships for rational catalyst design
2. Designing catalysts to inhibit byproduct formation
3. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions
4. Investigating long-term stability and regeneration of catalysts
5. Exploring novel catalyst supports and promoters
6. Developing in-situ/operando characterization techniques
7. Understanding and controlling gas-phase reactions, especially for S2-based ODHP
8. Developing catalysts with moderate redox properties to balance alkane activation and overoxidation

          与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯方面显示出了promising的结果。每种氧化剂对丙烯产率和选择性有不同的影响：

H2S：
- 可以显著提高丙烯产率，特别是与O2结合使用时
- 使用γ-Al2O3和V/Al2O3催化剂在700°C下实现了30.4%的丙烯产率
- 在705°C下使用H2S促进的ODH和熔盐催化剂获得高达60%的丙烯产率
- 在短停留时间内有效，抑制裂解反应

S2：
- 作为软氧化剂，减少丙烷的过度氧化
- 提高丙烯产率和选择性（在650°C时选择性为73%）
- 然而，转化率仍然较低（650°C时为10%）
- 气相反应占主导地位，而非催化反应

SO2：
- 增加丙烷转化率但在保持高丙烯选择性方面面临挑战
- 随着SO2分压的增加，选择性显著下降（从93.1%降至20%）
- 由于在大体积金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产物，导致丙烯产率低

1. 形成硫基副产物（CS2、硫醇、S8）
2. 平衡转化率和选择性，特别是对于SO2
