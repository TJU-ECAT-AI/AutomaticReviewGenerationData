Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. Their effectiveness and challenges vary:

H2S: 
- Can improve propylene yield, with up to 30.4% yield achieved using γ-Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 catalysts at 700°C.
- H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts can achieve propylene yields up to 60% at 705°C.
- Challenges include finding the optimal H2S concentration, as higher concentrations can inhibit conversion and adversely affect selectivity.

S2:
- As a soft oxidant, S2 can reduce overoxidation of propane compared to oxygen.
- Achieves good propylene selectivity (up to 85.7% over ZrO2 at 550°C).
- Major challenge is inhibiting the formation of byproducts like CS2.

SO2:
- Increases propane conversion but often results in lower propylene selectivity.
- The SO2ODHP pathway suffers from low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts.
- Selectivity decreases markedly with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the feed.

Compared to conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants generally offer improved selectivity and yield. However, each sulfur-based oxidant presents unique challenges in terms of byproduct formation and process optimization.

Key areas for future research include:
1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design.
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions to inhibit byproduct formation, especially for S2ODHP.
3. Investigating the role of catalyst support and pore size on performance.
4. Exploring novel catalyst systems, such as molten salts, which have shown promising results with H2S.
5. Understanding and controlling the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) in SO2-assisted ODHP.
6. Developing in situ/operando characterization techniques to elucidate the nature of active sites in sulfur-based ODHP catalysts.

与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出有前景的结果。它们的有效性和挑战各不相同：

H2S：
- 可以提高丙烯收率，使用γ-Al2O3和V/Al2O3催化剂在700°C下可达到30.4%的收率。
- 在熔盐催化剂上进行的H2S促进的ODH可在705°C下实现高达60%的丙烯收率。

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. These alternative oxidants can improve propylene yield and selectivity under certain conditions.

H2S: When used in combination with O2, H2S has demonstrated significant improvements in propylene yield. For instance, H2S-promoted ODH over a molten salt catalyst achieved propylene yields of up to 60% at 705°C, which is higher than yields obtained with conventional catalysts or gas-phase reactions.

S2: As a soft oxidant, S2 has shown the ability to reduce overoxidation of propane compared to oxygen. This can lead to improved selectivity towards propylene. S2 has been particularly effective when used with metal oxide catalysts like ZrO2.

SO2: While SO2 can increase propane conversion, it faces challenges in terms of selectivity. The SO2ODHP pathway often results in low propylene yields due to the formation of COx products, especially over bulk metal oxide catalysts. Increasing SO2 partial pressure in the feed tends to decrease selectivity significantly.

Challenges associated with each oxidant:
1. H2S: Optimizing residence times to suppress cracking reactions.
2. S2: Inhibiting the formation of byproducts like CS2.
3. SO2: Controlling selectivity and minimizing COx formation.

Key areas for future research:
1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design.
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions for each sulfur-based oxidant.
3. Investigating novel catalyst supports and promoters to enhance selectivity and stability.
4. Exploring combinations of sulfur-based oxidants to leverage their individual strengths.
5. Addressing the formation of sulfur-containing byproducts and improving overall carbon balance.

In conclusion, while sulfur-based oxidants show promise for ODHP, significant challenges remain in optimizing selectivity, yield, and catalyst stability. Future research should focus on understanding the reaction mechanisms and developing tailored catalysts for each oxidant to fully realize their potential in propylene production.

与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出有前景的结果。在某些条件下，这些替代氧化剂可以提高丙烯产率和选择性。

H2S：当与O2结合使用时，H2S显著提高了丙烯产率。例如，在705°C下，H2S促进的ODH在熔盐催化剂上实现了高达60%的丙烯产率，这高于常规催化剂或气相反应获得的产率。

S2：作为一种软氧化剂，S2与氧气相比，显示出减少丙烷过度氧化的能力。这可以提高对丙烯的选择性。当与ZrO2等金属氧化物催化剂一起使用时，S2特别有效。

SO2：虽然SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但在选择性方面面临挑战。SO2ODHP途径通常导致丙烯产率低，这是由于COx产物的形成，特别是在块状金属氧化物催化剂上。增加进料中SO2的分压会显著降低选择性。

与每种氧化剂相关的挑战：
1. H2S：优化停留时间以抑制裂解反应。
2. S2：抑制CS2等副产物的形成。
3. SO2：控制选择性并最小化COx的形成。

未来研究的关键领域：
1. 发展结构-活性关系，用于合理的催化剂设计。
2. 优化每种硫基氧化剂的催化剂组成和反应条件。
3. 研究新型催化剂载体和促进剂，以提高选择性和稳定性。
4. 探索硫基氧化剂的组合，以利用它们各自的优势。
5. 解决含硫副产物的形成问题，并改善整体碳平衡。

总之，虽然硫基氧化剂在ODHP中显示出前景，但在优化选择性、产率和催化剂稳定性方面仍面临重大挑战。未来的研究应该集中在理解反应机理和为每种氧化剂开发定制催化剂上，以充分实现它们在丙烯生产中的潜力。
