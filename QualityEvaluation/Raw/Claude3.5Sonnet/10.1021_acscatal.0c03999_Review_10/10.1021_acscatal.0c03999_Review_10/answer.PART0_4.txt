[1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2. (213) Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[4] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[5] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[6] "Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation utilizing sulfur vapor (S2: C3H8 = 1: 0.3) as an oxidant has been investigated at 600950 C over bulk Fe2O3, MgO, and Cr2O3 catalysts that are activated in a mixture of S2/H2S. (234) The study reveals that the C3H6 yield and selectivity improve in the presence of S2; however, the conversion (C3H8 conversion = 10% and C3H6 selectivity = 73%, at 650 C) is barely affected by the catalysts, indicating the dominance of gas-phase reactions."

[7] "The formation of sulfur-based byproducts, such as CS2, 1- and 2-propyl thiol mercaptan, and sulfur (S8), is also observed in the reactor effluent."

[8] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene compared to conventional oxidants. Each sulfur-based oxidant has its own advantages and challenges:

H2S:
- Can improve propylene yield, with yields up to 60% reported when using H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts.
- Effective at short residence times, achieving 30.4% propylene yield at 700°C with γ-Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 catalysts.
- Challenges include optimizing H2S concentration, as higher concentrations can inhibit conversion and selectivity.

S2:
- Considered a "soft oxidant" that can reduce overoxidation of propane.
- Improves propylene yield and selectivity, but conversion rates remain low (10% conversion, 73% selectivity at 650°C).
- Major challenge is inhibiting the formation of CS2 byproduct.

SO2:
- Potential for utilizing an acidic gas waste product.
- However, results in low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts.
- Challenges include improving selectivity and reducing undesired combustion products.

Common challenges for all sulfur-based oxidants include the formation of sulfur-based byproducts such as CS2, thiol mercaptans, and elemental sulfur (S8).

Key areas for future research to improve catalyst design and optimize the process include:
1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design.
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction conditions to enhance selectivity and conversion.
3. Investigating ways to inhibit the formation of sulfur-based byproducts.
4. Exploring novel catalyst systems, such as molten salts, that show promise for improved yields.
5. Understanding and controlling gas-phase reactions, especially for S2-based ODHP.
6. Developing catalysts with moderate redox properties to enable alkane activation while minimizing overoxidation and combustion.

与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）制丙烯方面显示出了有前景的结果。每种硫基氧化剂都有其自身的优势和挑战：

H2S：
- 可以提高丙烯产率，在熔盐催化剂上使用H2S促进的ODH时，报告的产率高达60%。
- 在短停留时间内有效，在700°C下使用γ-Al2O3和V/Al2O3催化剂可达到30.4%的丙烯产率。
- 挑战包括优化H2S浓度，因为更高的浓度可能抑制转化率和选择性。

S2：
- 被认为是一种可以减少丙烷过度氧化的"软氧化剂"。
- 提高了丙烯产率和选择性，但转化率仍然较低（650°C时，转化率为10%，选择性为73%）。
- 主要挑战是抑制CS2副产物的形成。

SO2：
- 有潜力利用酸性气体废物。
- 然而，由于在大体积金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产物，导致丙烯产率低。
- 挑战包括提高选择性和减少不期望的燃烧产物。

所有硫基氧化剂的共同挑战包括形成硫基副产物，如CS2、硫醇和元素硫（S8）。

未来改进催化剂设计和优化工艺的关键研究领域包括：
1. 发展结构-活性关系，用于合理的催化剂设计。
2. 优化催化剂组成和反应条件，以提高选择性和转化率。
3. 研究抑制硫基副产物形成的方法。
4. 探索显示出提高产率前景的新型催化剂系统，如熔盐。
5. 理解和控制气相反应，特别是对于基于S2的ODHP。
6. 开发具有适度氧化还原性能的催化剂，以实现烷烃活化，同时最小化过度氧化和燃烧。
