[1] "Alternate oxidants, such as sulfur or halogen-based oxidants, have shown promising results to selectively dehydrogenate propane to propylene. For example, co-feeding sulfur compounds, such as H2S, S2, and SO2, can improve propylene yield."

[2] "Using SO2 as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize SO2, which is an acidic gas. However, the SO2ODHP pathway results in low propylene because of the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts."

[3] "Subsequently, the use of a soft oxidant, such as S2, instead of oxygen can reduce the overoxidation of propane over ZrO2."

[4] "Ideally, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit the formation of byproducts, such as CS2, which is a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for S2ODHP."

[5] "Clark et al. have investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using γ-Al2O3 and 13% V/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of H2S + O2 at short residence times (t = 5 ms) and achieved a C3H6 yield of 30.4% at 700 C."

[6] "Gasper et al. demonstrate that C3H6 yields of up to 60% can be obtained for H2S-promoted ODH over LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 molten salt at 705 C."

[7] "The addition of SO2 (i.e., C3H8: SO2 of 6: 1) to the co-feed increases the C3H8 conversion; however, the selectivity decreases markedly (i.e., 93.1% to 20%) with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the co-feed."

[8] "In the future, developing a structureactivity relationship will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field."

Sulfur-based oxidants (H2S, S2, and SO2) have shown promising results in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to conventional oxidants. Their effectiveness and challenges vary:

H2S: 
- Can improve propylene yield, with up to 30.4% yield achieved using γ-Al2O3 and V/Al2O3 catalysts at 700°C.
- H2S-promoted ODH over molten salt catalysts can achieve propylene yields up to 60% at 705°C.
- Challenges include finding the optimal H2S concentration, as higher concentrations can inhibit conversion and adversely affect selectivity.

S2:
- As a soft oxidant, S2 can reduce overoxidation of propane compared to oxygen.
- Achieves good propylene selectivity (up to 85.7% over ZrO2 at 550°C).
- Major challenge is inhibiting the formation of byproducts like CS2.

SO2:
- Increases propane conversion but often results in lower propylene selectivity.
- The SO2ODHP pathway suffers from low propylene yield due to the formation of COx products over bulk metal oxide catalysts.
- Selectivity decreases markedly with increasing SO2 partial pressure in the feed.

Compared to conventional oxidants, sulfur-based oxidants generally offer improved selectivity and yield. However, each sulfur-based oxidant presents unique challenges in terms of byproduct formation and process optimization.

Key areas for future research include:
1. Developing a structure-activity relationship for rational catalyst design.
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions to inhibit byproduct formation, especially for S2ODHP.
3. Investigating the role of catalyst support and pore size on performance.
4. Exploring novel catalyst systems, such as molten salts, which have shown promising results with H2S.
5. Understanding and controlling the formation of oxidative condensation products (OCP) in SO2-assisted ODHP.
6. Developing in situ/operando characterization techniques to elucidate the nature of active sites in sulfur-based ODHP catalysts.

与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂（H2S、S2和SO2）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出有前景的结果。它们的有效性和挑战各不相同：

H2S：
- 可以提高丙烯收率，使用γ-Al2O3和V/Al2O3催化剂在700°C下可达到30.4%的收率。
- 在熔盐催化剂上进行的H2S促进的ODH可在705°C下实现高达60%的丙烯收率。
- 挑战包括找到最佳的H2S浓度，因为较高的浓度可能会抑制转化并对选择性产生不利影响。

S2：
- 作为一种软氧化剂，与氧相比，S2可以减少丙烷的过度氧化。
- 在ZrO2上550°C时可获得良好的丙烯选择性（高达85.7%）。
- 主要挑战是抑制CS2等副产物的形成。

SO2：
- 增加丙烷转化率但通常导致较低的丙烯选择性。
- SO2ODHP途径由于在块状金属氧化物催化剂上形成COx产物而导致丙烯产率低。
- 随着进料中SO2分压的增加，选择性显著下降。

与传统氧化剂相比，硫基氧化剂通常提供更高的选择性和收率。然而，每种硫基氧化剂在副产物形成和过程优化方面都存在独特的挑战。

未来研究的关键领域包括：
1. 建立结构-活性关系，以实现理性催化剂设计。
2. 优化催化剂组成以抑制副产物形成，特别是对于S2ODHP。
3. 研究催化剂载体和孔径对性能的影响。
4. 探索新型催化剂系统，如在H2S中表现良好的熔盐。
5. 了解和控制SO2辅助ODHP中氧化缩合产物（OCP）的形成。
6. 开发原位/操作中表征技术，以阐明硫基ODHP催化剂中活性位点的性质。
