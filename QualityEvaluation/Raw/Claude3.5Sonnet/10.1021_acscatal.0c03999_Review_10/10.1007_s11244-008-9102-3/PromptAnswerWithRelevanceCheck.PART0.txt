<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their use in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on the use of supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, particularly ethane and propane, using oxygen as the oxidant. It does not discuss sulfur-based oxidants such as H2S, S2, or SO2, their impact on propylene yield, associated challenges, or areas for future research in catalyst design for sulfur-based ODHP processes. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their use in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene. The document focuses on alkali metal chloride catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, but does not discuss sulfur-based oxidants. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of sulfur-based oxidants with conventional oxidants for ODHP based on the information in this document.

The given literature does not contain any information about sulfur-based oxidants or their use in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, particularly those containing lithium, sodium, and potassium. It does not discuss H2S, S2, SO2, or any other sulfur-based oxidants. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

To properly address this question, additional research would be needed on the use of sulfur-based oxidants in ODHP, their effects on propylene yield, associated challenges, byproduct formation, and potential areas for improving catalyst design and process optimization when using these alternative oxidants.

所给文献中不包含任何关于硫基氧化剂或其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中应用的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂(特别是含锂、钠和钾的催化剂)进行乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。文中没有涉及H2S、S2、SO2或任何其他硫基氧化剂。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。

要适当地回答这个问题,需要对硫基氧化剂在ODHP中的应用、它们对丙烯产率的影响、相关挑战、副产物的形成以及使用这些替代氧化剂时改进催化剂设计和优化整个过程的潜在领域进行额外的研究。
