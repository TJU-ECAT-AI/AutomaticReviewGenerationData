Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How does the described methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions, address the challenges of evaluating diverse catalysts, and what are the implications of focusing on specific performance criteria (olefin yield, stability, and space velocity) while excluding other factors for understanding catalyst behavior and the overall comparative analysis?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to the methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, or about evaluating catalysts for propane and isobutane reactions. The text appears to be in Russian and discusses oil well productivity in low-permeability reservoirs in Eastern Siberia. It does not address catalyst performance, dehydrogenation reactions, or comparative analysis of catalysts.
