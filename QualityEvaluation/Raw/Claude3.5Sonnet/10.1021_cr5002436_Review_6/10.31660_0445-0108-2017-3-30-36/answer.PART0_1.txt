The given literature does not contain any information relevant to the methodology for comparing catalyst performance in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins, particularly propane and isobutane reactions. The text appears to be in Russian and discusses topics related to oil well productivity in low-permeability reservoirs in Eastern Siberia. It does not address catalyst performance evaluation or dehydrogenation reactions.
