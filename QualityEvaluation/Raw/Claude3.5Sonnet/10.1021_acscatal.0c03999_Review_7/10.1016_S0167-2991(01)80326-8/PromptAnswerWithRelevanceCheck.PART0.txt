Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or Fe2O3/AC catalysts. The document focuses on Mo2C catalysts for propane dehydrogenation using CO2. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts, their reducibility, or reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于Fe氧化物基催化剂、CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)或Fe2O3/AC催化剂的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用CO2进行丙烷脱氢的Mo2C催化剂。文中没有提到Fe氧化物催化剂、它们的可还原性或涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的反应机理。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The text primarily discusses the use of Mo2C catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts, their reducibility, or support materials like Fe2O3/AC. The reaction mechanism described in the text involves Mo oxycarbide species rather than a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
