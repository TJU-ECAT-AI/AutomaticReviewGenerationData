[1] "Fig. 1 and Table 1 show propylene yields on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2 at a temperature range of 873898 K."

[2] "Promoting effects of CO2 on the propylene yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, and Ga catalysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1)."

[3] "In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, propylene yields were 13.2 and 10.8% at 898 K, respectively."

[4] "Fig. 2 shows the results of propylene yields at 823 K on vanadium oxide catalysts loaded on several supports, in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide. The support activity order at the reaction temperature of 823 K was oxidized diamond > Al2O3 > activated carbon > SiO2."

[5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document focuses primarily on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond, with limited mention of Fe2O3.

From the available information, we can infer that Fe oxide-based catalysts were not among the top performers in this reaction. The study found that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest propylene yields in the presence of CO2. 

The document does not discuss the reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts or the influence of support materials like activated carbon (AC) on Fe2O3 performance. There is also no specific information about the reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The study does suggest that maintaining a higher oxidation state of metal species (specifically mentioning chromium and vanadium) is an important factor for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the presence of CO2. This principle might apply to Fe oxide catalysts as well, but the document does not provide direct evidence for this.

In summary, the given literature does not contain sufficient information to adequately address the specific questions about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, their reducibility, support effects, or reaction mechanisms.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能。该文档主要关注氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂,对Fe2O3的提及有限。

从可用信息中,我们可以推断铁氧化物基催化剂在这个反应中不是表现最好的。研究发现,在CO2存在下,氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂表现出最高的丙烯产率。

该文档没有讨论铁氧化物催化剂的可还原性,或者活性炭(AC)等载体材料对Fe2O3性能的影响。也没有关于涉及铁氧化物氧化还原循环的反应机理的具体信息。

研究确实表明,保持金属物种(特别提到铬和钒)的较高氧化态是在CO2存在下烷烃脱氢反应中获得高催化活性的重要因素。这一原理可能也适用于铁氧化物催化剂,但文档没有提供直接的证据。

总之,给定的文献不包含足够的信息来充分回答关于CO2-ODHP中铁氧化物基催化剂、其可还原性、载体效应或反应机理的具体问题。
