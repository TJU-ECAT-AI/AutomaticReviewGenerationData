The literature does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or Fe2O3/AC in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study primarily focuses on oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3 and V2O5.

The document does not discuss the performance, reducibility, or reaction mechanism of Fe oxide catalysts. Instead, it reports on the superior performance of Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

The study shows that these catalysts (Cr2O3 and V2O5) exhibited higher catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. UV-Vis analyses revealed that CO2 helped maintain a higher oxidation state of the metal species on the catalyst surface, which is suggested to be an important factor for high catalytic activity.

While this information doesn't directly answer the question about Fe oxide catalysts, it does provide insight into the general behavior of metal oxide catalysts in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, which might be applicable to other metal oxides including iron oxide.

该文献没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或Fe2O3/AC在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的具体信息。这项研究主要集中在氧化金刚石负载的金属氧化物催化剂上，特别是Cr2O3和V2O5。

文档没有讨论Fe氧化物催化剂的性能、可还原性或反应机理。相反，它报告了在CO2存在下，氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。

研究表明，这些催化剂（Cr2O3和V2O5）在CO2存在下表现出比不存在CO2时更高的催化活性。UV-Vis分析揭示，CO2有助于维持催化剂表面金属物种的较高氧化态，这被认为是获得高催化活性的一个重要因素。

虽然这些信息并不直接回答关于Fe氧化物催化剂的问题，但它确实为CO2辅助丙烷脱氢中金属氧化物催化剂的一般行为提供了见解，这可能适用于包括铁氧化物在内的其他金属氧化物。
