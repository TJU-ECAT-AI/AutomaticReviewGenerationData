The literature does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study primarily focuses on oxidized diamond-supported catalysts, particularly Cr2O3 and V2O5. 

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, support materials like activated carbon (AC), or the reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide in CO2-ODHP. Instead, it reports on the performance of various metal oxide catalysts supported on oxidized diamond in the dehydrogenation of propane with and without CO2.

The study found that CO2 promoted propylene yield for Cr, V, and Ga catalysts supported on oxidized diamond. Specifically, Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed twice the activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence at 898 K. The propylene yields for these catalysts were 13.2% and 10.8% respectively at this temperature.

UV-Vis analysis revealed that CO2 helped maintain a slightly higher oxidation state of V2O5 and Cr2O3 on the catalyst surface compared to reactions without CO2. This suggests that CO2 plays a role in maintaining the oxidation state of the catalysts, which may contribute to their improved performance.

However, without specific information on Fe oxide catalysts, it's not possible to directly answer the question about their performance, reducibility, support effects, or reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODHP based on this document.

该文献没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的具体信息。该研究主要关注氧化金刚石负载的催化剂,特别是Cr2O3和V2O3。

文档没有讨论催化剂的可还原性、活性炭(AC)等支撑材料,或Fe氧化物在CO2-ODHP中的氧化还原循环反应机理。相反,它报告了各种负载在氧化金刚石上的金属氧化物催化剂在有无CO2条件下丙烷脱氢的性能。

研究发现,CO2促进了负载在氧化金刚石上的Cr、V和Ga催化剂的丙烯产率。具体来说,在898 K下,Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下的活性是没有CO2时的两倍。这些催化剂在该温度下的丙烯产率分别为13.2%和10.8%。

UV-Vis分析表明,与无CO2反应相比,CO2有助于保持催化剂表面V2O5和Cr2O3略高的氧化态。这表明CO2在维持催化剂氧化态方面发挥作用,可能有助于提高其性能。

然而,由于缺乏Fe氧化物催化剂的具体信息,基于这份文档无法直接回答关于它们在CO2-ODHP中的性能、可还原性、支撑效应或反应机理的问题。
