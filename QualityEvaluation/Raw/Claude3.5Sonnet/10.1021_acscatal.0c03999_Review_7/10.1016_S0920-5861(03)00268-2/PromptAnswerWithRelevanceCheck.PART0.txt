[1] "Fig. 1 and Table 1 show propylene yields on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2 at a temperature range of 873898 K."

[2] "Promoting effects of CO2 on the propylene yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, and Ga catalysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1)."

[3] "In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, propylene yields were 13.2 and 10.8% at 898 K, respectively."

[4] "Fig. 2 shows the results of propylene yields at 823 K on vanadium oxide catalysts loaded on several supports, in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide. The support activity order at the reaction temperature of 823 K was oxidized diamond > Al2O3 > activated carbon > SiO2."

[5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document focuses primarily on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond, with limited mention of Fe2O3.

From the available information, we can infer that Fe oxide-based catalysts were not among the top performers in this reaction. The study found that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest propylene yields in the presence of CO2. 

The document does not discuss the reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts or the influence of support materials like activated carbon (AC) on Fe2O3 performance. There is also no specific information about the reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The study does suggest that maintaining a higher oxidation state of metal species (specifically mentioning chromium and vanadium) is an important factor for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the presence of CO2. This principle might apply to Fe oxide catalysts as well, but the document does not provide direct evidence for this.

In summary, the given literature does not contain sufficient information to adequately address the specific questions about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, their reducibility, support effects, or reaction mechanisms.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能。该文档主要关注氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂,对Fe2O3的提及有限。

从可用信息中,我们可以推断铁氧化物基催化剂在这个反应中不是表现最好的。研究发现,在CO2存在下,氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂表现出最高的丙烯产率。

该文档没有讨论铁氧化物催化剂的可还原性,或者活性炭(AC)等载体材料对Fe2O3性能的影响。也没有关于涉及铁氧化物氧化还原循环的反应机理的具体信息。

研究确实表明,保持金属物种(特别提到铬和钒)的较高氧化态是在CO2存在下烷烃脱氢反应中获得高催化活性的重要因素。这一原理可能也适用于铁氧化物催化剂,但文档没有提供直接的证据。

总之,给定的文献不包含足够的信息来充分回答关于CO2-ODHP中铁氧化物基催化剂、其可还原性、载体效应或反应机理的具体问题。

The literature does not provide detailed information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document mainly focuses on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond. 

The performance of Fe oxide catalysts is only briefly mentioned in comparison to other metal oxides, and there is no specific information about Fe2O3/AC or the influence of catalyst reducibility on Fe-based catalysts. The document does not describe a proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

Instead, the literature reports that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed the highest activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, with nearly twofold higher activities compared to reactions without CO2. The support material (oxidized diamond) played a significant role in catalyst performance, outperforming other supports like Al2O3, activated carbon, and SiO2.

While not specific to Fe oxide catalysts, the document suggests that maintaining higher oxidation states of metal species (as observed for Cr and V) might be an important factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

文献中没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的详细信息。该文档主要关注支持在氧化金刚石上的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂。

Fe氧化物催化剂的性能只是在与其他金属氧化物的比较中简单提到，没有关于Fe2O3/AC或催化剂可还原性对Fe基催化剂影响的具体信息。文档没有描述涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的提议反应机制。

相反，文献报道在CO2存在下，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂显示出最高的丙烷脱氢活性，与无CO2反应相比，活性几乎提高了两倍。支撑材料(氧化金刚石)在催化剂性能中发挥了重要作用，优于其他支撑材料如Al2O3、活性炭和SiO2。

虽然不是特定于Fe氧化物催化剂，但文档表明，在CO2存在下保持金属物种的较高氧化态(如Cr和V所观察到的)可能是烷烃脱氢反应中高催化活性的一个重要因素。

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts produced mainly propylene (C3H6)."

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or Fe2O3/AC in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study primarily focuses on oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3 and V2O5.

The document does not discuss the performance, reducibility, or reaction mechanism of Fe oxide catalysts. Instead, it reports on the superior performance of Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

The study shows that these catalysts (Cr2O3 and V2O5) exhibited higher catalytic activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. UV-Vis analyses revealed that CO2 helped maintain a higher oxidation state of the metal species on the catalyst surface, which is suggested to be an important factor for high catalytic activity.

While this information doesn't directly answer the question about Fe oxide catalysts, it does provide insight into the general behavior of metal oxide catalysts in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, which might be applicable to other metal oxides including iron oxide.

该文献没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂或Fe2O3/AC在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的具体信息。这项研究主要集中在氧化金刚石负载的金属氧化物催化剂上，特别是Cr2O3和V2O5。

文档没有讨论Fe氧化物催化剂的性能、可还原性或反应机理。相反，它报告了在CO2存在下，氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。

研究表明，这些催化剂（Cr2O3和V2O5）在CO2存在下表现出比不存在CO2时更高的催化活性。UV-Vis分析揭示，CO2有助于维持催化剂表面金属物种的较高氧化态，这被认为是获得高催化活性的一个重要因素。

虽然这些信息并不直接回答关于Fe氧化物催化剂的问题，但它确实为CO2辅助丙烷脱氢中金属氧化物催化剂的一般行为提供了见解，这可能适用于包括铁氧化物在内的其他金属氧化物。

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study primarily focuses on oxidized diamond-supported catalysts, particularly Cr2O3 and V2O5. 

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, support materials like activated carbon (AC), or the reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide in CO2-ODHP. Instead, it reports on the performance of various metal oxide catalysts supported on oxidized diamond in the dehydrogenation of propane with and without CO2.

The study found that CO2 promoted propylene yield for Cr, V, and Ga catalysts supported on oxidized diamond. Specifically, Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed twice the activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence at 898 K. The propylene yields for these catalysts were 13.2% and 10.8% respectively at this temperature.

UV-Vis analysis revealed that CO2 helped maintain a slightly higher oxidation state of V2O5 and Cr2O3 on the catalyst surface compared to reactions without CO2. This suggests that CO2 plays a role in maintaining the oxidation state of the catalysts, which may contribute to their improved performance.

However, without specific information on Fe oxide catalysts, it's not possible to directly answer the question about their performance, reducibility, support effects, or reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODHP based on this document.

文档没有讨论催化剂的可还原性、活性炭(AC)等支撑材料,或Fe氧化物在CO2-ODHP中的氧化还原循环反应机理。相反,它报告了各种负载在氧化金刚石上的金属氧化物催化剂在有无CO2条件下丙烷脱氢的性能。

研究发现,CO2促进了负载在氧化金刚石上的Cr、V和Ga催化剂的丙烯产率。具体来说,在898 K下,Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下的活性是没有CO2时的两倍。这些催化剂在该温度下的丙烯产率分别为13.2%和10.8%。

UV-Vis分析表明,与无CO2反应相比,CO2有助于保持催化剂表面V2O5和Cr2O3略高的氧化态。这表明CO2在维持催化剂氧化态方面发挥作用,可能有助于提高其性能。

然而,由于缺乏Fe氧化物催化剂的具体信息,基于这份文档无法直接回答关于它们在CO2-ODHP中的性能、可还原性、支撑效应或反应机理的问题。

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document primarily focuses on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond, with limited data on Fe-based catalysts.

From the limited data presented, Fe oxide catalysts appear to have relatively low activity in CO2-ODHP of propane compared to Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. The propylene yield for the Fe catalyst was only 1.6% in the presence of CO2 and 0.8% in Ar at 873 K, which is significantly lower than the best-performing catalysts.

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, support materials (particularly Fe2O3/AC), or propose a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for CO2-ODHP. These aspects are not addressed in the provided literature.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, including the influence of reducibility, support materials, and reaction mechanisms, additional research and information would be required.
