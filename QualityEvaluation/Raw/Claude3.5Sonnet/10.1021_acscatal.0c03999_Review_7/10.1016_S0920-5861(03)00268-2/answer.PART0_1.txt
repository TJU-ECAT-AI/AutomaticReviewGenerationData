The literature does not provide detailed information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document mainly focuses on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond. 

The performance of Fe oxide catalysts is only briefly mentioned in comparison to other metal oxides, and there is no specific information about Fe2O3/AC or the influence of catalyst reducibility on Fe-based catalysts. The document does not describe a proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

Instead, the literature reports that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed the highest activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, with nearly twofold higher activities compared to reactions without CO2. The support material (oxidized diamond) played a significant role in catalyst performance, outperforming other supports like Al2O3, activated carbon, and SiO2.

While not specific to Fe oxide catalysts, the document suggests that maintaining higher oxidation states of metal species (as observed for Cr and V) might be an important factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

文献中没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的详细信息。该文档主要关注支持在氧化金刚石上的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂。

Fe氧化物催化剂的性能只是在与其他金属氧化物的比较中简单提到，没有关于Fe2O3/AC或催化剂可还原性对Fe基催化剂影响的具体信息。文档没有描述涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的提议反应机制。

相反，文献报道在CO2存在下，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂显示出最高的丙烷脱氢活性，与无CO2反应相比，活性几乎提高了两倍。支撑材料(氧化金刚石)在催化剂性能中发挥了重要作用，优于其他支撑材料如Al2O3、活性炭和SiO2。

虽然不是特定于Fe氧化物催化剂，但文档表明，在CO2存在下保持金属物种的较高氧化态(如Cr和V所观察到的)可能是烷烃脱氢反应中高催化活性的一个重要因素。
