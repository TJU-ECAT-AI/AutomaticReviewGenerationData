The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document primarily focuses on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond, with limited data on Fe-based catalysts.

From the limited data presented, Fe oxide catalysts appear to have relatively low activity in CO2-ODHP of propane compared to Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. The propylene yield for the Fe catalyst was only 1.6% in the presence of CO2 and 0.8% in Ar at 873 K, which is significantly lower than the best-performing catalysts.

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, support materials (particularly Fe2O3/AC), or propose a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for CO2-ODHP. These aspects are not addressed in the provided literature.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, including the influence of reducibility, support materials, and reaction mechanisms, additional research and information would be required.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的性能。该文档主要关注氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂,对铁基催化剂的数据有限。

从有限的数据来看,与Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂相比,铁氧化物催化剂在丙烷的CO2-ODHP中的活性相对较低。在873 K下,铁催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烯产率仅为1.6%,在Ar中为0.8%,远低于性能最好的催化剂。

该文档没有讨论催化剂的可还原性、载体材料(特别是Fe2O3/AC),也没有提出涉及铁氧化物氧化还原循环的CO2-ODHP反应机理。这些方面在所提供的文献中没有涉及。

要对CO2-ODHP中的铁氧化物基催化剂进行全面分析,包括可还原性、载体材料和反应机理的影响,需要额外的研究和信息。
