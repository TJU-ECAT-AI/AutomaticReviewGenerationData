Fe oxide-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the field of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their promising performance and potential for sustainable propylene production. The catalytic activity of these materials is heavily influenced by their reducibility and the intricate reaction mechanisms at play. Support materials play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Fe oxide catalysts, with activated carbon (AC) emerging as a particularly effective option. Fe2O3/AC has demonstrated superior activity compared to other supported Fe oxide catalysts, attributed to its unique structural properties and improved dispersion of active sites. The synergistic interaction between the Fe oxide and AC support facilitates efficient electron transfer and promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the CO2-ODHP process. Understanding the complex interplay between the Fe oxide species, support materials, and reaction conditions is key to optimizing catalyst design and advancing the development of more efficient and selective CO2-ODHP processes.
