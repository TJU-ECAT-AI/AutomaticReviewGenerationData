The literature does not specifically discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). However, it does provide insights into a related reaction - the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 using Fe oxide-based catalysts.

For Fe oxide-based catalysts, the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity. Active carbon (AC) was found to be the most effective support, with other materials like Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, and SiO2/ZrO2 showing very low activity. The high performance of Fe2O3/AC catalysts is likely due to the high surface area and low ash content of the AC support.

The reducibility of the Fe oxide catalyst is implicated in the proposed reaction mechanism. The literature suggests an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism involving a redox cycle of Fe oxide. In this cycle, the Fe oxide (represented as MeFemOn) is reduced by the hydrocarbon (ethylbenzene in this case) and then re-oxidized by CO2:

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

This mechanism involves the formation of surface ferrite as the active site. The presence of alkali metal promoters (Li, Na, K) was found to enhance the catalytic activity, likely by facilitating the formation of these active ferrite sites.

While this information is not directly about propane dehydrogenation, it suggests that similar principles might apply in CO2-ODHP using Fe oxide catalysts. The choice of support material, the reducibility of the Fe oxide, and the presence of promoters would likely be important factors in determining catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation as well.

虽然这篇文献并没有具体讨论CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)反应，但它确实为一个相关反应提供了见解 - 即使用Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2存在下进行乙苯脱氢。

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂，载体材料在决定催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用。活性炭(AC)被发现是最有效的载体，而其他材料如Al2O3、ZnO、TiO2、WO3和SiO2/ZrO2的活性很低。Fe2O3/AC催化剂的高性能可能是由于AC载体具有高比表面积和低灰分含量。

Fe氧化物催化剂的可还原性在提出的反应机理中起着重要作用。文献提出了一种涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的氧化脱氢机理。在这个循环中，Fe氧化物(表示为MeFemOn)被碳氢化合物(在这种情况下是乙苯)还原，然后被CO2重新氧化：

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

这种机理涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点的形成。碱金属促进剂(Li、Na、K)的存在被发现可以增强催化活性，可能是通过促进这些活性铁酸盐位点的形成。

虽然这些信息并不直接涉及丙烷脱氢，但它表明类似的原理可能适用于使用Fe氧化物催化剂进行CO2-ODHP。载体材料的选择、Fe氧化物的可还原性以及促进剂的存在可能是决定丙烷脱氢催化性能的重要因素。
