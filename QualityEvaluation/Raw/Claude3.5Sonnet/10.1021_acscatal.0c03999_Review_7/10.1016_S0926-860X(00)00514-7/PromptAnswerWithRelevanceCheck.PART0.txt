[1] "The influence of the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, type of the catalyst support as well as pretreatment method on catalytic activity and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide was determined. Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

[3] "According to Sugino et al. [14] ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is subsequently reoxidized by CO2:
MeFemOn + CO2 -> MeFemOn+1 + CO"

[4] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases. Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon."

The study focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, but some insights can be drawn:

Iron oxide catalysts supported on active carbon showed the highest performance for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. The catalyst reducibility likely plays a key role, as the proposed mechanism involves a redox cycle of iron oxide. 

The support material significantly influenced activity, with active carbon being far superior to other supports tested. Specifically, active carbon with the lowest ash content (D-90) performed best. This suggests the importance of a high surface area, conductive support that can stabilize iron oxide species.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves ethylbenzene oxidation by surface ferrite species, which are then re-oxidized by CO2. This redox cycle allows CO2 to act as a mild oxidant.

Catalyst composition was optimized at 5 wt% iron oxide, with alkali metal promoters further enhancing activity. The alkali metals likely help stabilize active iron species and may facilitate CO2 activation.

While not directly applicable to propane, these findings highlight key factors in developing effective catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using iron oxide-based materials.

尽管该研究重点是乙苯脱氢而非丙烷脱氢,但仍可得出一些见解:

负载在活性炭上的氧化铁催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢中表现最佳。催化剂的可还原性可能起关键作用,因为提出的机理涉及氧化铁的氧化还原循环。

载体材料显著影响活性,活性炭远优于其他测试的载体。具体来说,灰分含量最低的活性炭(D-90)表现最佳。这表明高比表面积、导电性好的载体能够稳定氧化铁物种很重要。

提出的反应机理涉及乙苯被表面铁氧化物物种氧化,然后铁氧化物被CO2再氧化。这种氧化还原循环使CO2能够作为温和的氧化剂。

催化剂组成在5重量%氧化铁时达到最优,碱金属助剂进一步提高了活性。碱金属可能有助于稳定活性铁物种,并可能促进CO2的活化。

虽然这些发现不能直接应用于丙烷,但它们突出了使用基于氧化铁材料开发CO2辅助氧化脱氢反应有效催化剂的关键因素。

The literature does not directly discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using CO2. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. Catalyst performance: Iron oxide-based catalysts, particularly when supported on active carbon and promoted with alkali metal oxides, showed the highest performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction with CO2.

2. Influence of support materials: Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material for iron oxide catalysts in this reaction. Other supports like Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, and SiO2/ZrO2 resulted in very low catalytic activity.

3. Catalyst reducibility: The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of iron oxide, suggesting that the reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its activity.

4. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves the oxidation of ethylbenzene by surface ferrite, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This can be represented by the following equation:

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

Where Me represents an alkali metal.

While this study focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, similar principles might apply to propane dehydrogenation. The redox properties of iron oxide, the use of active carbon as a support, and the promotion with alkali metals could potentially be beneficial for CO2-ODHP as well. However, further research would be needed to confirm this for propane specifically.

该文献并未直接讨论CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)。相反，它主要关注使用CO2进行乙苯的氧化脱氢。但是，我们可以从所提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 催化剂性能：氧化铁基催化剂，特别是当使用活性炭作为载体并用碱金属氧化物促进时，在使用CO2的氧化脱氢反应中表现出最高的性能。

2. 载体材料的影响：活性炭被发现是这种反应中氧化铁催化剂最有效的载体材料。其他载体如Al2O3、ZnO、TiO2、WO3和SiO2/ZrO2的催化活性很低。

3. 催化剂的可还原性：提出的反应机理涉及氧化铁的氧化还原循环，这表明催化剂的可还原性在其活性中起着关键作用。

4. 反应机理：提出的机理涉及表面铁酸盐对乙苯的氧化，然后被CO2再氧化。这可以用以下方程式表示：

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

其中Me代表碱金属。

虽然这项研究集中在乙苯脱氢上，但类似的原理可能适用于丙烷脱氢。氧化铁的氧化还原特性、使用活性炭作为载体以及碱金属的促进作用可能对CO2-ODHP也有潜在的益处。然而，还需要进一步的研究来确认这一点是否适用于丙烷。

The literature does not specifically discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). However, it does provide insights into a related reaction - the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 using Fe oxide-based catalysts.

For Fe oxide-based catalysts, the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity. Active carbon (AC) was found to be the most effective support, with other materials like Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, and SiO2/ZrO2 showing very low activity. The high performance of Fe2O3/AC catalysts is likely due to the high surface area and low ash content of the AC support.

The reducibility of the Fe oxide catalyst is implicated in the proposed reaction mechanism. The literature suggests an oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism involving a redox cycle of Fe oxide. In this cycle, the Fe oxide (represented as MeFemOn) is reduced by the hydrocarbon (ethylbenzene in this case) and then re-oxidized by CO2:

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

This mechanism involves the formation of surface ferrite as the active site. The presence of alkali metal promoters (Li, Na, K) was found to enhance the catalytic activity, likely by facilitating the formation of these active ferrite sites.

While this information is not directly about propane dehydrogenation, it suggests that similar principles might apply in CO2-ODHP using Fe oxide catalysts. The choice of support material, the reducibility of the Fe oxide, and the presence of promoters would likely be important factors in determining catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation as well.

虽然这篇文献并没有具体讨论CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)反应，但它确实为一个相关反应提供了见解 - 即使用Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2存在下进行乙苯脱氢。

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂，载体材料在决定催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用。活性炭(AC)被发现是最有效的载体，而其他材料如Al2O3、ZnO、TiO2、WO3和SiO2/ZrO2的活性很低。Fe2O3/AC催化剂的高性能可能是由于AC载体具有高比表面积和低灰分含量。

Fe氧化物催化剂的可还原性在提出的反应机理中起着重要作用。文献提出了一种涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的氧化脱氢机理。在这个循环中，Fe氧化物(表示为MeFemOn)被碳氢化合物(在这种情况下是乙苯)还原，然后被CO2重新氧化：

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

这种机理涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点的形成。碱金属促进剂(Li、Na、K)的存在被发现可以增强催化活性，可能是通过促进这些活性铁酸盐位点的形成。

虽然这些信息并不直接涉及丙烷脱氢，但它表明类似的原理可能适用于使用Fe氧化物催化剂进行CO2-ODHP。载体材料的选择、Fe氧化物的可还原性以及促进剂的存在可能是决定丙烷脱氢催化性能的重要因素。

The literature does not specifically discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). However, it does provide insights into the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts for a similar reaction - the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly those supported on active carbon (AC), showed high performance in the dehydrogenation reaction. The catalyst reducibility appears to play a crucial role, as the proposed mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. 

The support material significantly influences catalytic activity. Active carbon was found to be the best support, with the type of AC affecting performance. The AC with the lowest ash content (D-90) provided the best results.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves surface ferrite as the active site. Ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This suggests a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism where the lattice oxygen of the iron oxide participates in the reaction.

Catalyst composition also affects performance. The optimum iron content was found to be 5 wt% in all cases. Additionally, promotion with alkali metal oxides increased catalyst activity, with the best alkali metal to Fe atomic ratio being 0.1.

While these findings are for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, they may provide insights into the behavior of similar catalysts in CO2-ODHP, though direct extrapolation should be done cautiously due to differences in the reactants and reaction conditions.

文献并未具体讨论CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)。但是，它确实为类似反应 - 使用CO2进行乙苯脱氢生成苯乙烯 - 提供了Fe氧化物基催化剂性能的见解。

Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是那些负载在活性炭(AC)上的催化剂，在脱氢反应中表现出高性能。催化剂的可还原性似乎起着至关重要的作用，因为提出的机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。

载体材料显著影响催化活性。活性炭被发现是最佳载体，AC的类型会影响性能。灰分含量最低的AC(D-90)提供了最佳结果。

提出的反应机理涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点。乙苯被铁酸盐氧化成苯乙烯，然后铁酸盐被CO2重新氧化。这表明存在Mars-van Krevelen型机理，其中铁氧化物的晶格氧参与反应。

催化剂组成也影响性能。在所有情况下，最佳铁含量被发现为5 wt%。此外，碱金属氧化物的促进增加了催化剂活性，最佳碱金属与Fe的原子比为0.1。

虽然这些发现是针对乙苯脱氢的，但它们可能为CO2-ODHP中类似催化剂的行为提供见解，尽管由于反应物和反应条件的差异，直接外推应谨慎进行。
