[1] "The influence of the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, type of the catalyst support as well as pretreatment method on catalytic activity and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide was determined. Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

[3] "According to Sugino et al. [14] ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is subsequently reoxidized by CO2:
MeFemOn + CO2 -> MeFemOn+1 + CO"

[4] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases. Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon."

The study focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, but some insights can be drawn:

Iron oxide catalysts supported on active carbon showed the highest performance for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. The catalyst reducibility likely plays a key role, as the proposed mechanism involves a redox cycle of iron oxide. 

The support material significantly influenced activity, with active carbon being far superior to other supports tested. Specifically, active carbon with the lowest ash content (D-90) performed best. This suggests the importance of a high surface area, conductive support that can stabilize iron oxide species.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves ethylbenzene oxidation by surface ferrite species, which are then re-oxidized by CO2. This redox cycle allows CO2 to act as a mild oxidant.

Catalyst composition was optimized at 5 wt% iron oxide, with alkali metal promoters further enhancing activity. The alkali metals likely help stabilize active iron species and may facilitate CO2 activation.

While not directly applicable to propane, these findings highlight key factors in developing effective catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using iron oxide-based materials.

尽管该研究重点是乙苯脱氢而非丙烷脱氢,但仍可得出一些见解:

负载在活性炭上的氧化铁催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢中表现最佳。催化剂的可还原性可能起关键作用,因为提出的机理涉及氧化铁的氧化还原循环。

载体材料显著影响活性,活性炭远优于其他测试的载体。具体来说,灰分含量最低的活性炭(D-90)表现最佳。这表明高比表面积、导电性好的载体能够稳定氧化铁物种很重要。

提出的反应机理涉及乙苯被表面铁氧化物物种氧化,然后铁氧化物被CO2再氧化。这种氧化还原循环使CO2能够作为温和的氧化剂。

催化剂组成在5重量%氧化铁时达到最优,碱金属助剂进一步提高了活性。碱金属可能有助于稳定活性铁物种,并可能促进CO2的活化。

虽然这些发现不能直接应用于丙烷,但它们突出了使用基于氧化铁材料开发CO2辅助氧化脱氢反应有效催化剂的关键因素。
