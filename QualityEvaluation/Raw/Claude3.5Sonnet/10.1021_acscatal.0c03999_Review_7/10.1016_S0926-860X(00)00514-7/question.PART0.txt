Abstract
The influence of the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, type of the catalyst support as well as
pretreatment method on catalytic activity and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of
carbon dioxide was determined. Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the
highest performance in the reaction. An increase in the catalyst mass was observed during time-on-stream. Additionally the
specific surface area of the catalyst decreased. Temperature programmed oxidation showed the presence of carbon deposits
which could only be gasified above 700C.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The main industrial method to produce styrene is the
catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The pro-
cess is usually realized at 550620C with an excess
of overheated (720C) water vapor in the presence
of a hematite catalyst promoted mainly with potassium
and chromium oxide [1]. The water vapor supplies the
necessary energy to perform the endothermic dehy-
drogenation within the defined temperature range, but
it diminishes the partial pressure of the products, and
gasifies the carbon deposits. However, side reactions
are favored in the presence of water [2]. To keep an
acceptable high selectivity to styrene the ethylbenzene
conversion is limited to below 60%. Thus, styrene for

polymerization applications has to be purified (more
than 99.8%). The separation of unreacted ethylben-
zene from styrene is difficult due to similar boiling
points, 136 and 145C, respectively. The equilibrium
can be shifted to styrene using an oxidizing agent
reacting selectively with hydrogen. Moreover, the ox-
idation of hydrogen may provide the necessary energy
for the endothermic process. Studies with oxygen as
an oxidizing agent have been undertaken for over 30
years.
Alkhazov et al. [3] proposed that carbonaceous
deposits which were formed in the first hours of
time-on-stream on the surface of acidic catalysts act
as the real active centers for the oxidative dehydro-
genation. This hypothesis was confirmed by many
authors [49] and verified by using carbon molecular
sieves with which a conversion of 80% ethylbenzene
with a selectivity towards 90% styrene at 350C was
achieved [10]. Such a high conversion can be achieved

by introduction of small amounts of oxygen into the
standard H2O/EtB feed in an installation consisting
of a cascade of reactors. This, so-called SMART pro-
cess has been piloted but not applied on the industrial
scale [11].
The strong reactivity of oxygen causes, however,
burning of significant amounts of ethylbenzene and an
increase in the carbon oxides content in the products of
the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Thus,
another mild oxidant was looked for. An attempt of
using CO2 as oxidant together with H2O (modification
of the existing process) failed, because the catalytic
activity of the commercial iron oxide based catalysts
diminished strongly [12,13].
Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active
carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth
nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation
with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the
oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to sur-
face ferrite as an active site. According to Sugino et
al. [14] ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite,
which is subsequently reoxidized by CO2:
MeFemOn + CO2 MeFemOn+1 + CO
This mechanism is alternative to a model [15] acc-
epted till now where H2 produced in the course of
ethylbenzene dehydrogenation would be removed by
the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS).
,
H2 + CO2 CO + H2O
The catalytic results of Suginos experiments were
very promising. However, we found even better results
for promoted iron oxides supported on active carbon
[16]. The present paper reports about changes in cat-
alytic activity and stability of the catalyst series dif-
ferent in
• Kind and concentration of transition and alkali
metal oxides.
• Type of the catalyst supports.
• Preparation and pretreatment.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
All catalysts prepared in the present work were
support-type. Inorganic supports Al2O3 (Merck), ZnO
(The New Jersey Zinc Co.), TiO2 (Merck), WO3
(Merck) and SiO2/ZrO2 (Degussa; 25 wt.% SiO2)
were used as well as a wide range of carbona-
ceous materials. Pyrolyzed polyacrylnitryl (PPAN)
and polycarbonate (PC) were obtained through the
carbonization of suitable polymers in a flow of Ar
(1 l/min) for 3 h at 500 and 600C, respectively.
Four different active carbons (AC) with varying spe-
cific surface area and ash content were used. All were
initially activated with 90% HNO3 at 90C for 1 h:
• AC-A90 (Hajnwska, Poland): BET, 620 m2/g;
7.1 wt.% of ash.
• AC-B90 (Merck): BET, 900 m2/g; 4.9 wt.% of ash.
• AC-C90 (ChevironCarbon GmbH): BET, 1225
m2/g; 3.0 wt.% of ash.
• AC-D90 (ChevironCarbon GmbH): BET, 1170
m2/g; 0.2 wt.% of ash.
The active components (Fe, Cr, Cu, Ni and Co
oxides) were introduced by impregnation (incipient
wetness technique) with an aqueous solution of tran-
sition metal nitrates. The catalysts were dried in air
at 180C for 2 h. The most active one, 5 wt.% Fe sup-
ported on D-90, was impregnated successively with
an aqueous solution of alkaline metal (Li, Na, K) ni-
trates to obtain atomic ratios (Me/Fe) of 0.05, 0.1 and
0.2. After the impregnation, the catalysts were dried
again in air at 180C for 2 h.
2.2. Characterization of the catalysts
The catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed bed
(100 mg of catalyst) constant flow quartz microreac-
tor (38 cm length, 6.0 mm i.d.). The flows of helium
and CO2 were controlled by mass flow controllers
(Bronkhorst). Ethylbenzene was added with a con-
stant mass flow, using a liquid mass flow controller
(Bronkhorst), and evaporated in a temperature con-
trolled evaporation system (Bronkhorst) by the stream
of mixed gaseous reactants (He+CO2). The total flow
of 100 ml/min was delivered to the reaction system
enclosing usually 30 vol.% of CO2 and 3 vol.% of
ethylbenzene.

The reactor was connected on-line to two gas chro-
matographs. The first GC (Shimadzu GC-14B) was
equipped with a capillary column HP-1 (12 m, 0.2 mm
i.d. and 0.33 mm film of polydimethylsiloxan) and a
flame ionization detector. It was used to analyze the
hydrocarbons. The second GC (Shimadzu GC-8A)
was equipped with three packed columns: 1 m×1/8 in.
Porapak T (for water determination), 1 m×1/8 in. Car-
boxen 100 (for CH4 and CO2) and 5 m×1/8 in.
Molsieve 5 A (for H2, O2, N2 and CO) and a thermal
conductivity detector.
The preliminary screening of the catalyst perfor-
mance was carried out in a temperature range between
350 and 550C. The catalysts were first outgassed in a
helium stream at 350C and then the reaction started
at this temperature. After three GC analyses, of 20 min
each, the reaction temperature was increased for 50C,
and the next GC measurements began at 550C. Ben-
zene, toluene, styrene and water were detected as liq-
uid products. The screening allowed to recognize the
influence of the different types of support, the different
transition metal oxides as well as alkaline and alka-
line earth metal oxides. The influence of pretreatment
with different gas mixtures and pretreatment times on
the catalytic activity of catalysts with 5 wt.% Fe/AC
doped with potassium with an atomic ratio (K/Fe) of
0.1 was examined. The catalysts were calcined in a
flow of pure helium or helium mixed with CO2 (at a
molar ratio 7:3) for 15 and 30 min at 550C, followed
by 80 min of catalytic reaction at 550C.
The textural properties of the samples were deter-
mined by the BET method (N2 adsorption at 77 K) in
an ASAP 2000 (Micromeritics). The change in mass
of the samples due to catalysis was determined gravi-
metrically.
TPO experiments were performed with an Ami
1000 (Altamira). The catalyst samples (50 mg) were
linearly heated with a rate of 10 K/min from room
temperature to 1173 K. As oxidizing mixture, 5% O2
in helium was used. The total flow was 25 ml/min.
XPS spectra were recorded with a Leybold LH-10
spectrometer with a Mg Ka source and a multichannel
plate analyser, working at a pass energy of 29.6 eV.
For each investigated samples, 50 scans were taken.
The spectra were smoothed and a Shirley background
was subtracted, except for peaks with very low inten-
sity when a linear background was used. The surface
composition was calculated using the peak areas of
the O 1s, C 1s, K 2p and Fe 2p signals and sensitivity
factors according to Wagner et al. [17,18].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The initial screening of the catalysts
It was reported in a previous paper [16] that an iron
oxide catalyst promoted with LiNO3 supported on ac-
tive carbon D-90 showed 95% selectivity to styrene at
75% conversion of ethylbenzene during oxidative de-
hydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 at 550C. To
recognize better applicability of CO2 as the oxidative
reactant the studies were spread out on more transi-
tion metal oxides (Cr, Cu, Ni, Co and Fe) and alkali
metal oxides (Li, Na and K). Additionally, different
carbonaceous and inorganic supports were applied.
The results of catalyst screening showed that it is
necessary to use active carbon as support in order to
achieve acceptable activity in the conversion of ethyl-
benzene. For all catalysts supported by Al2O3, ZnO,
TiO2, WO3, SiO2/ZrO2 and carbonized polymers the
ethylbenzene conversion was lower than 3%. Simi-
lar results have been achieved with commercial cat-
alyst used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of
ethylbenzene (G-84 by Girdler and S-6-30 by Shell).
Hence, the description of detailed results and a dis-
cussion are limited to the catalysts on active carbon
supports in this paper.
The catalytic results of the carbon supported cata-
lysts are presented in Fig. 1. The iron oxide catalyst
showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene vary-
ing from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C. Inter-
mediate activity was observed for Cu and Cr oxides
containing catalysts, though the activity was about
four times lower. Additionally, a fast deactivation was
observed for these catalysts, even at the lower tem-
perature. Such a fast deactivation was not found in
case of iron catalysts.
The other catalysts, Ni and Co oxides on active
carbon, were only slightly active. Even at 550C the
conversion of ethylbenzene did not exceed 5%. It
should be added that the Ni and Co containing cata-
lysts showed the highest activity in the gasification of
carbon materials [19,20], resulting in a decrease in the
mass of these catalysts, and additionally in a produc-
tion of a higher amount of CO than in the other cases.

3.2. Optimization of the iron content and the type of
the active carbon
The results obtained for the catalysts containing 1,
5 and 10 wt.% of Fe, supported A-90, B-90, C-90 and
D-90, respectively, are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that
the type of support had a stronger influence on the
catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The
best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as
support showing extremely low ash content. In case
of the other active carbon supports the activity was
about four to five times lower. Independent of the type
of the active carbon the optimal concentration of iron
was about 5 wt.%. Additionally, the highest selectivity
to styrene was also observed with this concentration
of iron in the catalyst (Fig. 3). In the case of 10 wt.%
Fe/D-90, when most probably the whole surface of
active carbon is covered by an iron oxide phase, the
selectivity to styrene dropped suddenly, with a parallel
increase in the production of side products  benzene,
toluene and CO. The excess of iron oxide on the cata-
lyst surface causes the gasification of the carbonaceous
support as well as the deposit created during the initial
time of the reaction. For all other catalysts, selectivity
towards styrene was very high and exceeded 95%.
3.3. Influence of the contents of alkaline and alkaline
earth metal oxide promoters
The alkaline metal oxide promoters lithium, potas-
sium and sodium raised the activity of the catalyst
Fe/D-90 (Fig. 4). The alkaline metals were taken in
an atomic ratio of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 in relation to iron.
The highest activity to styrene is always observed for
a ratio of 0.1. A sequence of decreasing activity from
Li over Na to K was found at this ratio.
The dispersion of atoms was determined for K-
promoted Fe/D-90 catalysts by XPS (for surface com-
position) and elemental analysis (for bulk composi-
tion). The collected results are presented in Table 1.
The sample with an atomic ratio (K/Fe) of 0.1 in the
bulk showed the highest activity and possessed the
highest amount of potassium dispersed on the sur-
face (K/Fe=1.2). The results point to the presence of
ferrite on the catalyst surface as proposed by Sugino
et al. [14].

0.901.09 (for the highest active catalysts with atomic
ratio (Me/Fe) of 0.1). No hydrogen was observed
among reaction products, since in the temperature
range used hydrogen can be totally transferred by
the RWGS towards CO and H2O. At the same time
carbonaceous deposits were created on the surface in
the course of reaction which could hardly be hydro-
genated [20].
3.4. Carbon deposits
The mass of the catalysts was changed during the
standard catalytic tests. For the most active catalysts
(5 wt.% iron) an increase in mass was observed.
Whereas for the catalyst with the highest concentra-
tion of iron the final mass of catalyst was lower than
the initial one. In this case an increase in CO produc-
tion was observed (up to 550C), i.e. the iron oxide
phase on the catalyst surface catalyzes the gasification

of the active carbon support. The catalyst with the
lower concentration of iron oxide (5 wt.%) showed
constant activity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation,
though a part of the hydrocarbons were cracked to
form carbon deposits. This results in a decrease in the
specific surface area of the catalyst especially in the
range of microporosity (Table 2).
The introduction of alkaline metal oxide promoters
to iron oxide supported D-90 protected the catalyst
partly against the loss of specific surface area (Tables 3
and 4). For the catalysts with an atomic ratio, alkali
metal to iron, of 0.1 the decays of the total specific
surface area (from 64% for Na-promoted to 75% for
Li-promoted catalyst) and pore volume (from 61% for
Na-promoted to 72% for Li-promoted catalyst) were
considerably smaller than in the case of unpromoted
Fe/D-90 (82 and 80%, respectively).

TPO experiments, carried out with the catalyst
5 wt.% Fe/D-90+K (atomic ratio=0.1) after 6 h of
catalytic reaction confirmed the formation of carbon
deposits which were gasified above 700C (Fig. 5). It
was observed in a separate experiment that the fresh
catalyst was already completely oxidized at this tem-
perature. The determination of the character of the
deposits demands however further investigations.
3.5. Pretreatment conditions
No strong effects of the changes of pretreatment
conditions on the catalytic performance were observed
at 550C (Fig. 6). A tendency of an increase in the
activity was noticed in the case of the use of CO2
in He as pretreatment gas mixture. After 15 min pre-
treatment time a styrene yield of 63.7% and after a

pretreatment time of 30 min a styrene yield of 65.6%
was obtained at 550C. A further prolongation of the
pretreatment caused no further change in the behavior
of the catalyst. The reverse effect with respect to ac-
tivity was observed for various pretreatment times in
pure helium. After 15 min a yield of styrene of 60.7%
was obtained. A further decrease in activity to 53.9%
was observed after a pretreatment of 30 min in He.

gas mixture containing CO2 the loss of surface area
and porosity for the used catalyst was less pronounced
than after the pretreatment in pure helium.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons
could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon

dioxide. The other carbonaceous materials like PPAN
or PC as well as the inorganic compounds led to inac-
tive catalysts at the investigated range of temperature.
The introduction of Fe, Cr or Cu oxides on the
active carbon support by impregnation method led
to active catalysts. Ni and Co oxide on the ac-
tive carbon were more active in the gasification of
the support than in the dehydrogenation process.
Among the used transition metal oxides the best
activity was observed for iron containing catalysts.
Additionally it showed slower deactivation than the
chromium and copper oxides supported on active
carbon.
The catalytic behavior was influenced significantly
by both the type of active carbon used and the iron
content. The best support was the active carbon (D-90)
with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount
of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases. Added alkaline metal
oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on
active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio
was found to be 0.1.

our results are rather in accordance with the mech-
anism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
with CO2 based on the formation of potassium fer-
rite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et
al. [14], because we have found a correlation be-
tween the surface concentration of K and the catalyst
activity.
After all catalytic tests, a change in the mass of the
catalysts was observed. As revealed by TPO experi-
ments this can be either attributed to the formation of
carbon deposits or to a gasification of the support. This
fact can also be connected with the observed consid-
erable decrease in specific surface area and the porous
volume after catalysis.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
