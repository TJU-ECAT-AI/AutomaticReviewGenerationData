[1] "The influence of the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, type of the catalyst support as well as pretreatment method on catalytic activity and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide was determined. Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

[2] "Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

[3] "MeFemOn + CO2 MeFemOn+1 + CO"

[4] "The iron oxide catalyst showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene varying from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C."

[5] "It is clear that the type of support had a stronger influence on the catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as support showing extremely low ash content."

While the literature focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, some insights can be drawn regarding Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Catalyst performance: Fe oxide-based catalysts supported on active carbon showed the highest performance among tested catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation. The conversion increased with temperature, reaching 60.7% at 550°C.

2. Influence of support: The type of support had a stronger influence on catalytic activity than Fe concentration. Active carbon, particularly low-ash content D-90, was the most effective support.

3. Reducibility: The literature doesn't directly discuss catalyst reducibility, but the proposed reaction mechanism suggests that Fe oxide undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle.

4. Reaction mechanism: An oxidative mechanism was proposed, involving surface ferrite as the active site. The redox cycle of Fe oxide can be represented as:
MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

5. Promoters: Alkali metal oxide promoters enhanced the activity of Fe oxide supported on active carbon.

While this information provides some insights into Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, it's important to note that the specific behavior in propane dehydrogenation may differ and would require further investigation.

虽然这篇文献主要关注乙苯脱氢而非丙烷脱氢，但我们仍可以从中得到一些关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢中的见解：

1. 催化剂性能：在活性炭上负载的Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助脱氢反应中表现出最高的性能。随着温度的升高，转化率增加，在550°C时达到60.7%。

2. 载体的影响：载体类型对催化活性的影响比Fe浓度更大。活性炭，特别是低灰分含量的D-90，是最有效的载体。

3. 可还原性：文献并未直接讨论催化剂的可还原性，但提出的反应机理暗示Fe氧化物在催化循环中经历还原和再氧化过程。

4. 反应机理：提出了一种氧化机理，表面铁氧化物作为活性位点。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环可表示为：
MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

5. 助剂：碱金属氧化物助剂提高了负载在活性炭上的Fe氧化物的活性。

虽然这些信息为我们提供了一些关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢中的见解，但需要注意的是，在丙烷脱氢中的具体行为可能会有所不同，需要进一步研究。
