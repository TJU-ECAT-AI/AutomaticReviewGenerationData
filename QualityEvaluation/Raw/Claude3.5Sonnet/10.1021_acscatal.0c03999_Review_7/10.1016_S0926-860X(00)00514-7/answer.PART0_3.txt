The literature does not specifically discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). However, it does provide insights into the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts for a similar reaction - the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly those supported on active carbon (AC), showed high performance in the dehydrogenation reaction. The catalyst reducibility appears to play a crucial role, as the proposed mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. 

The support material significantly influences catalytic activity. Active carbon was found to be the best support, with the type of AC affecting performance. The AC with the lowest ash content (D-90) provided the best results.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves surface ferrite as the active site. Ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This suggests a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism where the lattice oxygen of the iron oxide participates in the reaction.

Catalyst composition also affects performance. The optimum iron content was found to be 5 wt% in all cases. Additionally, promotion with alkali metal oxides increased catalyst activity, with the best alkali metal to Fe atomic ratio being 0.1.

While these findings are for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, they may provide insights into the behavior of similar catalysts in CO2-ODHP, though direct extrapolation should be done cautiously due to differences in the reactants and reaction conditions.

文献并未具体讨论CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)。但是，它确实为类似反应 - 使用CO2进行乙苯脱氢生成苯乙烯 - 提供了Fe氧化物基催化剂性能的见解。

Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是那些负载在活性炭(AC)上的催化剂，在脱氢反应中表现出高性能。催化剂的可还原性似乎起着至关重要的作用，因为提出的机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。

载体材料显著影响催化活性。活性炭被发现是最佳载体，AC的类型会影响性能。灰分含量最低的AC(D-90)提供了最佳结果。

提出的反应机理涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点。乙苯被铁酸盐氧化成苯乙烯，然后铁酸盐被CO2重新氧化。这表明存在Mars-van Krevelen型机理，其中铁氧化物的晶格氧参与反应。

催化剂组成也影响性能。在所有情况下，最佳铁含量被发现为5 wt%。此外，碱金属氧化物的促进增加了催化剂活性，最佳碱金属与Fe的原子比为0.1。

虽然这些发现是针对乙苯脱氢的，但它们可能为CO2-ODHP中类似催化剂的行为提供见解，尽管由于反应物和反应条件的差异，直接外推应谨慎进行。
