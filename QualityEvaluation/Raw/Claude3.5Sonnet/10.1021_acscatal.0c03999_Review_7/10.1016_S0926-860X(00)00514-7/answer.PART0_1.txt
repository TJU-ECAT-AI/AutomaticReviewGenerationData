The literature does not directly discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Instead, it focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using CO2. However, some insights can be drawn from the information provided:

1. Catalyst performance: Iron oxide-based catalysts, particularly when supported on active carbon and promoted with alkali metal oxides, showed the highest performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction with CO2.

2. Influence of support materials: Active carbon was found to be the most effective support material for iron oxide catalysts in this reaction. Other supports like Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, and SiO2/ZrO2 resulted in very low catalytic activity.

3. Catalyst reducibility: The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of iron oxide, suggesting that the reducibility of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its activity.

4. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves the oxidation of ethylbenzene by surface ferrite, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This can be represented by the following equation:

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

Where Me represents an alkali metal.

While this study focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, similar principles might apply to propane dehydrogenation. The redox properties of iron oxide, the use of active carbon as a support, and the promotion with alkali metals could potentially be beneficial for CO2-ODHP as well. However, further research would be needed to confirm this for propane specifically.

该文献并未直接讨论CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)。相反，它主要关注使用CO2进行乙苯的氧化脱氢。但是，我们可以从所提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 催化剂性能：氧化铁基催化剂，特别是当使用活性炭作为载体并用碱金属氧化物促进时，在使用CO2的氧化脱氢反应中表现出最高的性能。

2. 载体材料的影响：活性炭被发现是这种反应中氧化铁催化剂最有效的载体材料。其他载体如Al2O3、ZnO、TiO2、WO3和SiO2/ZrO2的催化活性很低。

3. 催化剂的可还原性：提出的反应机理涉及氧化铁的氧化还原循环，这表明催化剂的可还原性在其活性中起着关键作用。

4. 反应机理：提出的机理涉及表面铁酸盐对乙苯的氧化，然后被CO2再氧化。这可以用以下方程式表示：

MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO

其中Me代表碱金属。

虽然这项研究集中在乙苯脱氢上，但类似的原理可能适用于丙烷脱氢。氧化铁的氧化还原特性、使用活性炭作为载体以及碱金属的促进作用可能对CO2-ODHP也有潜在的益处。然而，还需要进一步的研究来确认这一点是否适用于丙烷。
