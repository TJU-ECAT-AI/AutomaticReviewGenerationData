<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The text primarily discusses the synthesis and characterization of Ag-doped HZSM-5 zeolites. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts, catalyst reducibility, support materials like Fe2O3/AC, or reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles for CO2-ODHP of propane. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given document.
