[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[3] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC (iron oxide supported on activated carbon), show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalyst's reducibility plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts, which contributes to its superior performance in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield.

The support material significantly influences the catalyst's performance. Activated carbon (AC) as a support enhances the reducibility of Fe2O3, allowing it to undergo a complete reduction process from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO and finally to Fe. This improved reducibility is key to the high catalytic performance of Fe2O3/AC compared to other tested catalysts.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The process consists of two main steps:

1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant

This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of the active sites on the catalyst surface, maintaining its activity throughout the reaction. The ability of the Fe oxide to undergo this redox cycle efficiently is crucial for its effectiveness in the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是Fe2O3/AC（负载在活性炭上的氧化铁），在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中表现出良好的性能。催化剂的可还原性在其催化活性中起着关键作用。与其他Fe氧化物基催化剂相比，Fe2O3/AC表现出更好的可还原性，这有助于其在C3H8转化和C3H6产率方面的优异表现。

载体材料显著影响催化剂的性能。作为载体的活性炭（AC）增强了Fe2O3的可还原性，使其能够从Fe2O3完全还原到Fe3O4，再到FeO，最后到Fe。这种改进的可还原性是Fe2O3/AC相比其他测试催化剂具有高催化性能的关键。

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的proposed反应机理涉及一个氧化还原循环。该过程主要包括两个步骤：

1. 使用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6
2. 通过CO2（作为软氧化剂）将还原的Fe氧化物重新氧化

这个氧化还原循环允许催化剂表面活性位点的持续再生，在整个反应过程中保持其活性。Fe氧化物能够有效地进行这种氧化还原循环的能力对于其在CO2-ODHP过程中的有效性至关重要。
