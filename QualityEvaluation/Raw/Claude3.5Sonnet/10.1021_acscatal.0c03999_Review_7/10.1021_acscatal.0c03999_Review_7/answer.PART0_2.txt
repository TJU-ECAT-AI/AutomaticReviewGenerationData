[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."

[2] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon), show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalyst's reducibility plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts, with the reduction process proceeding through Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. This enhanced reducibility is the primary reason for its superior catalytic performance in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield.

The support material significantly influences the catalyst's performance. While γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived MgO supports retard the reducibility of Fe2O3 due to strong interactions between Fe oxide and the support, activated carbon (AC) allows for improved reducibility, leading to higher catalytic activity.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The process consists of two main steps:

1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant

This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of the active sites, maintaining the catalyst's activity throughout the reaction process.

铁氧化物基催化剂，特别是Fe2O3/AC（活性炭），在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中表现出良好的性能。催化剂的可还原性对其催化活性起着至关重要的作用。与其他铁氧化物基催化剂相比，Fe2O3/AC展现出更好的可还原性，其还原过程按照Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe的顺序进行。这种增强的可还原性是其在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率方面表现优异的主要原因。

载体材料对催化剂的性能有显著影响。虽然γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的MgO载体由于铁氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而抑制了Fe2O3的可还原性，但活性炭（AC）载体允许更好的可还原性，从而导致更高的催化活性。

Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP反应的提议机理涉及一个氧化还原循环。该过程主要包括两个步骤：

1. 利用Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化成C3H6
2. 通过CO2（作为软氧化剂）将还原后的Fe氧化物重新氧化

这个氧化还原循环允许活性位点的持续再生，在整个反应过程中保持催化剂的活性。
