[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."

[2] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC, show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalytic activity is strongly influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the choice of support material.

Fe2O3/AC demonstrates superior performance compared to other Fe-based catalysts, exhibiting higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield while maintaining comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3. This enhanced performance is attributed to the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 when supported on activated carbon (AC).

The reducibility of Fe2O3/AC follows a stepwise reduction process: Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. This improved reducibility is key to its high catalytic performance. In contrast, other supports like γ-Al2O3 and MgO can hinder the reducibility of Fe oxide due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support material.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. The process consists of two main steps:

1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant

This redox cycle allows for continuous catalytic activity and highlights the crucial role of Fe oxide's redox properties in the CO2-ODHP process. The choice of AC as a support material enhances this redox cycle, leading to improved catalytic performance compared to other Fe-based catalysts.

铁氧化物基催化剂，尤其是Fe2O3/AC，在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中表现出良好的性能。催化活性强烈受到催化剂还原性和载体材料选择的影响。

与其他铁基催化剂相比，Fe2O3/AC展现出更优异的性能，具有更高的C3H8转化率和C3H6收率，同时保持与纯Fe2O3相当的C3H6选择性。这种性能提升归因于Fe2O3负载在活性炭（AC）上时还原性的改善。

Fe2O3/AC的还原性遵循逐步还原过程：Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe。这种改善的还原性是其高催化性能的关键。相比之下，其他载体如γ-Al2O3和MgO可能会由于铁氧化物与载体材料之间的强相互作用而抑制铁氧化物的还原性。

Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP反应的proposed机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。该过程主要包括两个步骤：

1. 利用Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6
2. 用CO2作为软氧化剂重新氧化还原后的Fe氧化物

这种氧化还原循环允许持续的催化活性，并突出了Fe氧化物氧化还原性质在CO2-ODHP过程中的关键作用。选择AC作为载体材料增强了这种氧化还原循环，从而与其他Fe基催化剂相比，导致了更好的催化性能。
