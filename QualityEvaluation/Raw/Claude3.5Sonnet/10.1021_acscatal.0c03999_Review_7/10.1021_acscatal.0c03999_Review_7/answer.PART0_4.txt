[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[2] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[3] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon), show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalyst's reducibility plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts, which accounts for its superior catalytic performance in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield.

The support material significantly influences the catalyst's performance. Activated carbon (AC) as a support enhances the reducibility of Fe2O3, allowing for a complete reduction pathway from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO to Fe. In contrast, other supports like γ-Al2O3 or MgO can hinder the reducibility of Fe oxide due to strong interactions between the oxide and the support.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The process consists of two main steps:

1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant

This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of the active sites, maintaining the catalyst's activity throughout the reaction. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3/AC facilitates this cycle, contributing to its superior catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP.

在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中，铁氧化物基催化剂，特别是Fe2O3/AC（活性炭），表现出良好的性能。催化剂的可还原性对其催化活性起着关键作用。与其他铁氧化物基催化剂相比，Fe2O3/AC表现出更好的可还原性，这解释了其在丙烷转化和丙烯产率方面的优异催化性能。

载体材料对催化剂的性能有显著影响。活性炭（AC）作为载体增强了Fe2O3的可还原性，使其能够完成从Fe2O3到Fe3O4到FeO再到Fe的完整还原路径。相比之下，其他载体如γ-Al2O3或MgO会因与氧化物之间的强相互作用而降低铁氧化物的可还原性。

Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP反应的提议机理涉及一个氧化还原循环。该过程主要包括两个步骤：

1. 利用Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6
2. CO2作为软氧化剂重新氧化还原后的铁氧化物

这个氧化还原循环允许活性位点的持续再生，维持催化剂在整个反应过程中的活性。Fe2O3/AC的改进可还原性促进了这个循环，从而贡献了其在CO2-ODHP中的优异催化性能。
