[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."

[2] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

[4] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC (Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon), show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalyst's reducibility plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility compared to other supports, with the reduction process following the sequence Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. This enhanced reducibility is the key factor behind its superior catalytic performance, outperforming other catalysts in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield.

The support material significantly influences the catalyst's performance. While Fe2O3 supported on γ-Al2O3 and hydrotalcite-derived FeMg catalysts show retarded reducibility due to strong interactions between Fe oxide and the support, activated carbon (AC) as a support facilitates improved reducibility of Fe2O3. This highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate support material to enhance the catalyst's performance.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The reaction is thought to proceed in two main steps:

1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant

This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of the active sites, enabling sustained catalytic activity. The ability of the catalyst to undergo this redox cycle efficiently is critical for its performance in CO2-ODHP, further emphasizing the importance of the catalyst's reducibility.

在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中，铁氧化物基催化剂，尤其是Fe2O3/AC（Fe2O3负载在活性炭上）表现出良好的性能。催化剂的可还原性对其催化活性起着至关重要的作用。与其他载体相比，Fe2O3/AC展现出更好的可还原性，其还原过程遵循Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe的顺序。这种增强的可还原性是其优越催化性能的关键因素，在丙烷转化率和丙烯产率方面均优于其他催化剂。

载体材料显著影响催化剂的性能。虽然负载在γ-Al2O3和水滑石衍生的FeMg催化剂上的Fe2O3由于铁氧化物与载体之间的强相互作用而表现出受阻的可还原性，但活性炭（AC）作为载体能够促进Fe2O3的可还原性。这突显了选择适当载体材料以提高催化剂性能的重要性。

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的提议机理涉及氧化还原循环。该反应被认为通过两个主要步骤进行：

1. 利用来自Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧将C3H8氧化为C3H6
2. 通过CO2（作为温和氧化剂）将还原后的Fe氧化物重新氧化

这种氧化还原循环允许活性位点的持续再生，从而实现持续的催化活性。催化剂高效进行这种氧化还原循环的能力对其在CO2-ODHP中的性能至关重要，这进一步强调了催化剂可还原性的重要性。
