The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: Fe-based catalysts undergo redox cycles during the reaction, with Fe species being reduced and re-oxidized. This redox behavior is crucial for the catalytic activity.

2. Support materials: CeO2 has been identified as a promising support material due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen storage capacity and mobility of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

3. Bimetallic composition: The selectivity towards olefins can be tuned by adjusting the bimetallic composition of active sites. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide:

1. Fe species are initially in a higher oxidation state.
2. During the reaction, Fe is reduced by propane, facilitating C-H bond activation.
3. CO2 then re-oxidizes the reduced Fe species, completing the catalytic cycle.
4. The presence of CeO2 support enhances CO2 activation and oxygen mobility, contributing to the overall catalytic performance.

This mechanism allows for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a soft oxidant, which helps to avoid deep oxidation and reduce coke formation while maintaining catalyst stability.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂的可还原性：Fe基催化剂在反应过程中经历氧化还原循环，Fe物种被还原和再氧化。这种氧化还原行为对催化活性至关重要。

2. 载体材料：CeO2被确定为有前景的载体材料，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。基于铈的催化剂的氧储存能力和氧移动性有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点。

3. 双金属组成：通过调整活性位点的双金属组成，可以调节烯烃的选择性。例如，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt主导的表面有利于C-C键断裂。

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环：

1. Fe物种最初处于较高的氧化态。
2. 在反应过程中，Fe被丙烷还原，促进C-H键的活化。
3. CO2随后再氧化还原态的Fe物种，完成催化循环。
4. CeO2载体的存在增强了CO2的活化和氧的移动性，有助于整体催化性能。

这种机理允许使用CO2作为软氧化剂进行丙烷的氧化脱氢，有助于避免深度氧化和减少积碳形成，同时保持催化剂的稳定性。
