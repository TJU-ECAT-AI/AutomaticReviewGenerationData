The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: Fe-based catalysts undergo redox cycles during the reaction, with Fe species being reduced and re-oxidized. This redox behavior is crucial for the catalytic activity.

2. Support materials: CeO2 has been identified as a promising support material due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. The oxygen storage capacity and mobility of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

3. Bimetallic composition: The selectivity towards olefins can be tuned by adjusting the bimetallic composition of active sites. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide:

1. Fe species are initially in a higher oxidation state.
2. During the reaction, Fe is reduced by propane, facilitating C-H bond activation.
3. CO2 then re-oxidizes the reduced Fe species, completing the catalytic cycle.
4. The presence of CeO2 support enhances CO2 activation and oxygen mobility, contributing to the overall catalytic performance.

This mechanism allows for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a soft oxidant, which helps to avoid deep oxidation and reduce coke formation while maintaining catalyst stability.

2. Support materials: CeO2 has been identified as a promising support material for Fe-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. The main advantage of CeO2 is its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission, which enhances the overall catalytic performance.

3. Bimetallic composition: The combination of Fe with other metals (e.g., Ni, Pt) can significantly affect the catalyst's performance. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle:

1. Reduction of Fe oxide species by propane, leading to propylene formation and creation of oxygen vacancies.
2. Re-oxidation of reduced Fe species by CO2, regenerating the catalyst and producing CO.
3. The cycle continues, with the Fe oxide species alternating between reduced and oxidized states.

This mechanism allows for the activation of both propane and CO2, with the catalyst support (e.g., CeO2) playing a crucial role in CO2 activation. The overall performance is determined by the balance between various competitive reaction pathways, including ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and alkane dry reforming.
