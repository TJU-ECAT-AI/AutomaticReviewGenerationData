[1] "Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2"

[2] "Recently, the effect of oxide supports was also investigated by the same research group highlighting the CeO2 as the most promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission."

[3] "Olefin selectivity was found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites."

[4] "DFT calculations suggested that Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined surface favors C-C cleavage."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: The ability of Fe oxide to undergo reduction and re-oxidation is crucial for its catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed to be a key part of the reaction mechanism.

2. Support materials: CeO2 is highlighted as a promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. This property of CeO2 enhances the overall catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts.

3. Bimetallic composition: The selectivity towards olefins can be tuned by rational selection of bimetallic active sites. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond breaking, while Pt-containing surfaces promote C-C cleavage.

4. Reaction pathways: The catalytic performance is influenced by competitive reaction pathways, including ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. The balance between these pathways affects the overall selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the Fe species undergo reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic process. This cycle is facilitated by the presence of CO2 as a soft oxidant, which can partially re-oxidize reduced Fe species. The support material, particularly CeO2, plays a crucial role in CO2 activation, which is an essential step in the overall reaction mechanism.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 催化剂的可还原性：Fe氧化物进行还原和再氧化的能力对其催化活性至关重要。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环被认为是反应机理的关键部分。

2. 载体材料：CeO2被强调为有前景的载体，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。CeO2的这种特性增强了Fe氧化物基催化剂的整体催化性能。

3. 双金属组成：通过合理选择双金属活性位点可以调节烯烃的选择性。例如，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而含Pt表面促进C-C键断裂。

4. 反应途径：催化性能受到竞争性反应途径的影响，包括ODH、逆水气变换反应和烷烃干重整。这些途径之间的平衡影响催化剂的整体选择性和活性。

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe物种在催化过程中经历还原和再氧化。这个循环由CO2作为软氧化剂的存在而促进，CO2可以部分再氧化还原态的Fe物种。载体材料，特别是CeO2，在CO2活化中起着关键作用，这是整个反应机理中的重要一步。
