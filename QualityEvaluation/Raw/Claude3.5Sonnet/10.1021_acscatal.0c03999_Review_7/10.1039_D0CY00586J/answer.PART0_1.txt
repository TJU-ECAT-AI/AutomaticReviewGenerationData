The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: Fe oxide catalysts can undergo redox cycles, which is crucial for their catalytic activity. The ability of Fe species to be reduced and re-oxidized during the reaction plays a key role in the overall performance.

2. Support materials: CeO2 has been identified as a promising support material for Fe-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. The main advantage of CeO2 is its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission, which enhances the overall catalytic performance.

3. Bimetallic composition: The combination of Fe with other metals (e.g., Ni, Pt) can significantly affect the catalyst's performance. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle:

1. Reduction of Fe oxide species by propane, leading to propylene formation and creation of oxygen vacancies.
2. Re-oxidation of reduced Fe species by CO2, regenerating the catalyst and producing CO.
3. The cycle continues, with the Fe oxide species alternating between reduced and oxidized states.

This mechanism allows for the activation of both propane and CO2, with the catalyst support (e.g., CeO2) playing a crucial role in CO2 activation. The overall performance is determined by the balance between various competitive reaction pathways, including ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and alkane dry reforming.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂的可还原性：Fe氧化物催化剂可以经历氧化还原循环，这对其催化活性至关重要。Fe物种在反应过程中被还原和再氧化的能力在整体性能中起着关键作用。

2. 载体材料：CeO2被认为是Fe基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的一种有前景的载体材料。CeO2的主要优势在于其能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2，从而提高整体催化性能。

3. 双金属组成：Fe与其他金属（如Ni、Pt）的组合可以显著影响催化剂的性能。例如，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而富Pt表面有利于C-C键断裂。

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的proposed反应机理涉及氧化还原循环：

1. 丙烷还原Fe氧化物物种，生成丙烯并创造氧空位。
2. CO2重新氧化还原态Fe物种，再生催化剂并产生CO。
3. 循环继续，Fe氧化物物种在还原态和氧化态之间交替。

这种机理允许同时活化丙烷和CO2，其中催化剂载体（如CeO2）在CO2活化中起着关键作用。整体性能由各种竞争性反应途径之间的平衡决定，包括氧化脱氢、逆水气变换和烷烃干重整。
