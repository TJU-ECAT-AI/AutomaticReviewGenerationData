The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

2. Support materials: CeO2 is highlighted as a promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. The use of CeO2 as a support material enhances the catalytic performance of Fe-based catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanism: The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation process. The presence of CO2 as a soft oxidant helps in partial re-oxidation of reduced Fe species, maintaining the catalytic activity.

4. Catalyst stability: Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts show enhanced stability compared to other Fe-based catalysts. The deactivation mechanism differs from traditional coking, as evidenced by the presence of small regions with higher Fe content in spent catalysts.

5. Bimetallic composition: The catalytic performance can be tuned by rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites. For example, Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt combinations show different behaviors in terms of bond activation and product selectivity.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe species undergo reduction during the dehydrogenation process and are partially re-oxidized by CO2. This cycle, coupled with the oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the CeO2 support, contributes to the enhanced stability and performance of the Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 催化剂的可还原性：Fe掺杂的CeO2催化剂表现出增强的稳定性和有前景的催化性能。基于CeO2的催化剂的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点。

2. 载体材料：CeO2被突出强调为一种有前景的载体，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。使用CeO2作为载体材料可以增强Fe基催化剂的催化性能。

3. 反应机理：提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，这对脱氢过程至关重要。CO2作为软氧化剂的存在有助于还原态Fe物种的部分再氧化，保持催化活性。

4. 催化剂稳定性：与其他Fe基催化剂相比，Fe掺杂的CeO2催化剂表现出增强的稳定性。失活机制与传统的结焦不同，这从使用过的催化剂中存在Fe含量较高的小区域得到证实。

5. 双金属组成：通过理性选择活性位点的双金属组成可以调节催化性能。例如，Fe-Ni和Fe-Pt组合在键活化和产物选择性方面表现出不同的行为。

反应机理可能涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe物种在脱氢过程中经历还原，并被CO2部分再氧化。这个循环，加上CeO2载体的氧移动性和储存能力，促进了Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的增强稳定性和性能。
