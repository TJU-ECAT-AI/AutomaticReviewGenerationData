Mo2C catalyzes propane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis at 823 K; carbon selectivity can be tuned to
>95% propylene via dehydrogenation in absence of H2, >95% CH4 via hydrogenolysis with H2 co-feed, or
>80% CO via reforming pathways with H2 and CO2 co-feed. The changes in selectivity are mediated by an
evolution in the coverage of oxidized (O) and carbidic () surface sites which results in an evolution of
OAO, OA, and A site pairs that catalyze propane dehydrogenation. The fraction of O in relation
to  was assessed from measured CO2/CO ratios because reverse water gas shift equilibrium exists under
H2/CO2 co-feed steady state reaction conditions. Kinetic models based on the two-site dehydrogenation
mechanism could be used to quantitatively describe measured rates of propane dehydrogenation at
steady state with or without H2 and/or CO2 co-feed and the transient evolution in dehydrogenation rates
upon removing H2 or CO2 in the influent stream to note that OA site pairs exhibit the highest rate per
gram. This model also provides a rationale for O inhibition of H-activated hydrogenolysis pathways and
for promotion of oxidative dehydrogenation rates with the introduction of hydrogen into CO2-propane
influent streams. This study extends concepts developed for examining the catalytic effects of O cover-
age on oxidative light alkane conversion from transition metal catalysts to also include carbidic
formulations.

1. Introduction
Multifunctional transition metal carbides, capable of both COx
reduction [18] and alkane activation [911], provide an opportu-
nity to use CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to
produce olefins. Solymosi et al. [9,11] reported that co-processing
of CO2AC2H6 and CO2AC3H8 mixtures at ambient pressure and
850923 K over bulk and supported Mo2C resulted in 860% alkane
conversion with >90% selectivity to dehydrogenation pathways
below 873 K and high selectivity to CO via alkane reforming above
873 K with effluent CO/C2H4 > 10 at temperatures above 960 K.
Porosoff et al. [12] and Frank et al. [10] reported increased alkane
conversion and CO selectivity over Mo2C catalysts at 773873 K
and enhanced time-on-stream stability of these formulations upon
introducing H2 to C3H8/CO2 or C2H6/CO2 influent mixtures (1:1:2
C3H8:CO2:H2 or 5:5:1 C2H6:CO2:H2). Pursuant to these reports, we
present a kinetic and mechanistic assessment of propane oxidative
dehydrogenation using CO2
as an oxidant on b-Mo2C bulk
formulations.
Molybdenum-based catalytic formulations have been shown to
occlude and release interstitial atoms including C, H, O, and N,
resulting in altered catalytic rates and selectivity [1316]. Sinfelt
[14] reported ethane hydrogenolysis at 668 K; monotonically
increasing hydrogenolysis rates over 5 h of reaction time were
attributed to the gradual inclusion of lattice C to form a molybde-
num carbide catalyst as evinced by post reaction X-ray diffraction
(XRD). Oliveira et al. [17] used density functional theory (DFT) in
conjunction with temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to
demonstrate that occluded H within the carbidic crystal lattice
can be removed via thermal treatment and consumed via benzene
hydrogenation. Leary et al. [18] reported the removal of O and C
from molybdenum oxycarbidic lattices as CO, CO2, H2O, and CH4
via TPD under H2 and He atmospheres up to temperatures of
1173 K. Total C and O removed during activation protocols
accounted for >7 monolayers (monolayers calculated based on
reported specific surface areas of 6 m2 g1 and 1.1  1015 (surface
Mo atoms) cm2), and activation procedures under various reac-
tion gas environments and temperatures resulted in both differing
rates of ethylene hydrogenation (maximum and minimum nonzero
initial rates of 196 and 0.6 lmol s1 gcat
1 were achieved via He acti-
vation at 1173 K and 773 K, respectively) and differing deactivation
profiles. The changes in catalytic function, described by changing

hydrogenation rates and deactivation profiles, were ascribed to
surface and bulk structural modifications induced by activation
protocols.
Chin, Iglesia, and coworkers [1923] have studied oxidation
reactions of CO, CH4, CH3OH, and C2H6 with O2 and CO2 over sup-
ported Pt, Pd, Ni, and Co catalysts using gas phase flow reactors at
temperatures of 5001300 K in conjunction with DFT methods. Tu
et al. [20] investigated CH4 oxidation with CO2 over Ni, Co, and
NiACo clusters at 873 K, reporting that reverse water-gas shift
(RWGS, CO2 + H2 ? CO + H2O) was catalyzed to equilibrium con-
versions, allowing for quantification of the chemical potential of
surface O in relation to the equilibrated effluent CO2/CO or H2O/
H2 ratios. These O surrogates were used to kinetically model
CH4 oxidation rates as a single-valued function of the O chemical
potential for oxophilic Co-based formulations. Separately, Tu et al.
[21] analyzed CH3OH oxidative dehydrogenation by quantifying
the surface O and subsequent CH3OH oxidation reactions as a
function of O2/CH3OH; this descriptor could be used to assess the
extent of oxidation of Pd clusters and the relative populations of
oxidized (O) and metallic sites (). The kinetically relevant steps
of CH3OH activation pathways transitioned from activation on
metallic site pairs (A) to OA site pairs and finally to oxidized
(OAO) site pairs as a function of increasing oxidative potential
as measured by the O2/CH3OH ratio. Transient and steady state
rates of alkane/oxidant reactions on oxophilic transition metal car-
bide catalysts can be described based on the same concepts of evo-
lution in densities of OAO, OA, and A site pairs as those
postulated for transition metal catalysts[1923] as we discuss
below.
Rodriguez and coworkers [1,24] used DFT methods in conjunc-
tion with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies to demonstrate the
importance of the C/Mo surface ratio on the ability of b-Mo2C to
reduce CO2 to CH3OH and CO, reporting that Mo-terminated MoCx
catalyzes direct C@O rupture of CO2 whereas C-terminated MoCx
enables CO2 reduction via either hydrogenation to form CH3OH
or CH4 or deoxygenation to form either CO or residual surface O.
Liu et al. [24] reported that O-covered C-terminated b-Mo2C cat-
alyzed the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO + H2O ? CO2 + H2)
at rates higher than those observed over an industrial-based cop-
per WGS catalyst.
Lee and coworkers [2527] reported H2-activated hydrocarbon
conversion by alumina-supported Mo and Mo2C including benzene
hydrogenation and n-butane hydrogenolysis at ambient pressure
and 323 K and 510 K, respectively. Mo- and Mo2C-catalyzed
hydrogenolysis exhibited positive order dependences upon H2
pressure (r  PH2
a , a  1.5). H-activated transition metal carbide-
catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways are inhib-
ited by surface oxidation as we have reported with respect to ben-
zene and acetone hydrogenation over Mo2C catalysts [5,28] and as
Ribeiro et al. [29,30] have reported with respect to C5
+ alkane
hydrogenolysis over WCx catalysts.
In this work, we report the kinetics of propane and CO2 conver-
sion pathways over molybdenum oxycarbidic catalytic formula-
tions
and
utilize
propane dehydrogenation
steady-state
and
transient rate measurements to quantify co-feed-induced catalyst
transformations; changes in dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis
rates and selectivity can be rationalized as oxygen-coverage-
dependent effects. Molybdenum oxycarbide formulations catalyze
the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction to equilibrium at 823 K
under the H2/CO2 co-feed conditions studied in this work, allowing
for the use of the effluent PCO2/PCO ratio to calculate the oxidized
fraction of the catalyst surface, hO. Molybdenum oxycarbides cat-
alyze propane dehydrogenation in presence or in absence of H2 or
CO2 co-feed, and dehydrogenation rates can be modeled based on a
two-site mechanism involving (i) two oxidized sites (OAO), (ii)
two carbidic sites (A), or (iii) a pair comprised of an oxidized site
and a reduced site (OA). Catalyst transients due to changes in
surface O site density induced by the reductive or oxidative poten-
tial of the gas phase atmosphere can be quantitatively assessed
using propane dehydrogenation as a probe reaction. H2 co-feed
induces catalytic CAC bond scission to form primarily CH4 in
absence of CO2; the presence of CO2 leads to selective formation
of CO after CAC scission events. The absence of  sites results in
severe inhibition of hydrogenolysis rates.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst synthesis
Syntheses and reactions were carried out in a gas phase flow
reactor with stainless steel transfer lines [31]. Catalyst synthesis
was carried out using a temperature programmed reaction method
used in previous work [1416]. Catalysts were prepared in a quartz
tubular reactor (I.D. 6.9 mm). The catalyst bed was held in place
with two quartz wool plugs, and homogeneous reaction was min-
imized by filling reactor void volume with concentric quartz rods
preceding and following the catalyst bed. Ammonium paramolyb-
date precursors (0.11.0 g, sieved, 177400 lm, (NH4)6Mo7O24-
4H2O, Sigma, 99.98%, trace metal basis) were heated in a single-
zone split tube furnace (Applied Test Systems) at 0.06 K s1 to
623 K and held at 623 K for 12 h under total flow of 3.0 cm3 s1
of 15 vol% CH4 (Matheson, 99.97%) in H2 (Minneapolis Oxygen,
99.999%). The temperature was then ramped at 0.046 K s1 from
623 K to 873 K and held at 873 K for 2 h. The reactor was then
cooled under the same gas flow to 823 K to begin reaction.
Catalyst passivation was carried out after reaction before expos-
ing the spent catalyst to ambient conditions; the catalyst was trea-
ted in flowing 1% O2/He (Matheson, Certified Standard Purity) at
1.0 cm3 s1 for at least 1 h in an effort to passivate the carbide sur-
face and avoid violent bulk oxidation with atmospheric O2 [17,18].
Passivated samples were used for ex situ characterization.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen uptake measurements were performed at liquid
nitrogen boiling temperature on post-reaction Mo2C samples using
an ASAP Micromeritics 2020 analyzer in order to calculate BET
surface area and porosity values. Prior to N2 physisorption
measurements, samples were degassed to <6 lm Hg and heated
to 523 K at 0.17 K s1 and held for 24 h.
X-ray diffraction was performed with a Bruker D8 Discover 2D
X-ray diffractometer equipped with a 2-D VÅNTEC-500 detector
and a 0.8 mm collimator. Co Ka1 and Ka2 radiation was used in con-
junction with a graphite monochromator. Scans were performed in
two or three frames for 900 s to scan a total range of 2h = 23 to
67. The 2-D scans were converted to 1-D intensity vs. 2h and
merged for analysis. A zero-background holder was used with vac-
uum grease for sample support. Diffractogram analysis and com-
parison was performed after converting data relative to a Cu
radiation source. Spent catalyst samples were shown to have bulk
structures of primarily b-Mo2C (Fig. S.1).
2.3. Reaction methods
All reactions were performed on as-synthesized samples never
exposed
to
atmospheric
conditions.
Temperature
of
as-
synthesized formulations was decreased to reaction temperature,
typically 823 K, under synthesis flow conditions. Gas phase flows
were then switched to reactive mixtures in order to begin reaction
rate measurements. Reaction temperature was measured using a
K-type thermocouple in contact with the exterior of the quartz

reactor. Liquid feed was introduced via either a KD Scientific syr-
inge pump (KDS120) or an M6 Vici Valco high pressure liquid chro-
matography (HPLC) pump into stainless steel reactor lines heated
by resistive heating tape. Reactor effluent was vented to ambient
pressure; system pressure varied from 101 kPa to 130 kPa as mea-
sured by a PX209-300G5V pressure transducer. Reactor tempera-
ture
varied
from
808
to

experiments
performed isothermally at 823 K. Volumetric flow rate was kept
constant at 1.7 cm3 s1 unless otherwise specified. Space velocity
variations were achieved by proportional alteration of all reactant
and diluent flows to maintain constant mole fractions of all gas
phase species.
Reactor effluent was analyzed by an online Agilent 7890A gas
chromatograph (GC) using a flame ionization detector (FID) and a
thermal
conductivity
detector
(TCD).
Eluent
separation
was
achieved in parallel using a dimethylpolysiloxane J&W HP-1 col-
umn (50.0 m long, 320 lm diameter, 0.52 lm film thickness) con-
nected to the FID and a GS-GasPro (60 m long, 320 lm diameter)
preceding the TCD. CO, CO2, and H2 were quantified via TCD, and
H2O was quantified only under steady state conditions via oxygen
balance. All hydrocarbon species were quantified using the FID.
2.4. Parameter estimation for kinetic modeling
Kinetic parameter optimization and uncertainty determination
(95% marginal highest posterior density intervals) were done using
the Athena Visual Studio (v14.2, W.E. Stewart and M. Caracotsios)
statistical software package and Bayesian statistical estimation
techniques. Rate measurements repeated at identical inlet gas
phase conditions at later times-on-stream were treated as replicate
measurements for parameter estimation. Rate measurements
included for fit analysis were measured after reaching steady state
conditions for >60 min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Co-feed effects on dehydrogenation and CAC scission pathways
Propane conversion was observed over Mo2C at 823 K both in
absence of a co-feed and under three separate co-feed regimes:
(i) CO2 co-feed, (ii) H2 co-feed, and (iii) H2/CO2 co-feed. Propane
conversion and product selectivity are plotted in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 shows that propane is converted with >95% selectivity to
propylene via dehydrogenative pathways in absence of a co-feed or
in presence of a CO2 co-feed; addition of CO2 results in a 1.5
increase in dehydrogenation rates. Addition of H2 co-feed to C3H8
flow results in a 3-fold increase in propane conversion, but
30% of converted propane undergoes unselective CAC bond scis-
sion via H2-catalyzed hydrogenolysis to primarily form CH4. Selec-
tivities reported in Fig. 1 were chosen due to the use of similar
reaction conditions for comparison purposes, but changes in the
relative proportions of each co-fed gas could shift product selectiv-
ity to further favor CH4 or reforming CO via increases in H2 and
both H2/CO2, respectively. Alkane hydrogenolysis over molybde-
num
carbidic
formulations
has
been
reported
for
n-butane
[27,32], propane [10], and C5
+ alkanes [33]. Frank et al. [10] reported
the beneficial effect of H2 co-feed on propane conversion and the
concurrent detrimental effect on dehydrogenation selectivity over
Mo2C at 773 K in a gas phase flow reactor. Chen and coworkers [12]
also reported H2-induced effects during Mo2C-catalyzed oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2. As we discuss below, these
beneficial effects of H2 addition on propane chemical conversion
reflect oxygen surface-coverage-induced site density changes.
Concurrent co-feed of CO2 and H2 results in the highest conver-
sion of propane with a typical dehydrogenation selectivity of
55%; the remaining 45% of propane is converted via CAC scission
pathways to form C1 and C2 compounds, with reforming CO dom-
inating the selectivity among CAC scission products. Due to the
presence of a CO2 co-feed and the known RWGS functionality of
Mo2C, reforming CO was quantified by a carbon balance on carbon
oxides as shown in Eq. (1),
rReformingCO  rCO2  rCOEffluent  rCO2Influent

H2 co-feed increased propane conversion due to activation of
H-induced CAC scission routes. CAC scission pathways yielded
primarily CH4 as a terminal product in absence of a CO2 co-feed,
and the presence of CO2 in addition to H2 induced propane reform-
ing to form CO after CAC bond scission. Under H2/CO2 co-feed con-
ditions, CAC scission events resulted in >95% selectivity to
reforming CO and <5% selectivity to CH4. Formation of CH4 was pri-
marily the result of hydrogenolysis and not CO2 methanation (rCH4
< 1  103 lmol s1gcat
1 for PCO2 = 1.1 kPa, pH2 = 6.2 kPa, and rCH4 
9.2  103 lmol s1 gcat
1 for PCO2 = 1.1 kPa, pH2 = 6.2 kPa, PC3H8 =
5.2 kPa). Alterations in CAC scission pathways can be rationalized
as a function of co-feed-induced surface modification as discussed
in further detail in Section 3.5.
3.2. Reverse water-gas shift equilibration
Molybdenum carbide catalyzes the forward and reverse water-
gas shift reactions as well as the deoxygenation of biomass-derived
ketones and aldehydes, demonstrating the propensity for carbidic
activation of C@O bonds [18]. The presence of all species involved
in the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) during oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane via CO2 (H2, CO2, CO, and H2O) neces-
sitates the investigation of RWGS kinetics over Mo2C. The approach
to equilibrium for the reverse water gas shift reaction, gRWGS, is
calculated as shown in Eq. (2); gRWGS values shown in Fig. 2
demonstrate that Mo2C catalyzes the RWGS reaction to equilib-
rium under CO2/H2 co-feed conditions reported in this work.
Fig. 1. Propane conversion and carbon selectivity with (i) no co-feed, (ii) PCO2 = 1.1
kPa co-feed, (iii) PH2 = 6.2 kPa co-feed, and (iv) PH2 = 6.2 kPa, PCO2 = 1.1 kPa co-feed.

The approach to equilibrium of the RWGS reaction was also cal-
culated in presence of C3H8 co-feed and is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a)
shows that RWGS equilibrium is reached under H2 and CO2 co-feed
pressures used in this study that varied from 1 to 11 kPa CO2 and
650 kPa H2. Fig. 3b) shows that at constant H2 and CO2 pressure,
RWGS equilibrium is also reached when varying C3H8 pressure
from 0.5 to 10 kPa. As discussed in Section 3.1, H2/CO2 co-feed
conditions induce propane reforming and therefore increased COx
concentrations along the length of the bed, yet RWGS equilibrium
is
typically
achieved
even
under
conditions
of
excess
COx
formation.
gRWGS values deviate slightly from unity based upon reaction
conditions, varying from 0.5 to 1.4, exhibiting the greatest varia-
tions upon changes in H2 and CO2. H2/CO2 variations in the reaction
atmosphere alter the reductive and oxidative potential, respec-
tively, of the gaseous environment. Molybdenum oxycarbidic for-
mulations
form
non-stoichiometric
surface
and
bulk
compositions via incorporation or loss of lattice carbon, oxygen,
and hydrogen depending on the reaction gas atmosphere and tem-
perature [17,18,34]. Transients affect the surface and bulk compo-
sition and structure and involve incorporation or evolution of C,
H, or O as CO, CO2, H2, H2O, or CH4, and the consequent effects
upon catalytic electronic structure can transiently affect measured
equilibration of the RWGS reaction.
We posit that the calculated gRWGS values plotted in Fig. 3
demonstrate that RWGS is equilibrated under all reported H2/CO2
co-feed conditions and consider this to be the case in formulating
a kinetic description in Section 3.3 below. RWGS equilibrium
implies oxygen coverages on the surface can be adduced from an
assessment of CO2 decomposition as reported by Chin and cowork-
ers [20] and as shown in Eq. (3)

3.3. Kinetics of propane dehydrogenation
Dehydrogenation rates were noted to transiently change after
altering partial pressures of H2 and CO2, however, steady state
rates achieved after transients were typically stable with <10%
deactivation over periods of over 2000 min (Fig. S.2). Fig. 4 shows
the effect of temperature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation
in absence of co-feed, in presence of CO2 co-feed, and in presence
of combined H2/CO2 co-feeds; corresponding apparent activation
energies for dehydrogenation for these reaction conditions are cal-
culated to be 180  19, 110  12, and 69  11 kJ mol1, respectively.
The distinct activation energies can be rationalized as the result of
altered reactant binding due to varied surface terminations and/or
the prevalence of different dehydrogenation mechanisms. Tu et al.
[21] reported variations in the effective barrier for CH3OH activa-
tion from 26 to 90 kJ mol1 for A and OAO site pairs, respec-
tively; surface oxidation altered the energetics of methanol
activation by changing the active site distribution. The varied acti-
vation energies observed for propane activation in this work simi-
larly implicate co-feed induced surface O coverage that alters the
nature of the dehydrogenation active sites or the dehydrogenation
mechanism itself.
The mechanism of alkane dehydrogenation can be most simply
modeled by a two-site mechanism, characterized by alkane dehy-
drogenation over two proximate catalytically active sites. The cat-
alyst surface, under the relevant ODH conditions, can be assumed
to be entirely comprised of carbidic sites () and oxidized sites
(O) by neglecting other possible alkyl or hydroxyl surface inter-
mediates in formulating the simplest kinetic model. The site bal-
ance can be written in typical fashion as follows in Eq. (4), and
the fraction of oxidized sites can be calculated in conjunction with
Eq. (3),

The two-site dehydrogenation mechanism on a surface that is
comprised entirely of () or (O) sites can potentially involve alkane
activation on three distinct types of site pairs denoted by their
respective rate constants: (i) oxidized OAO site pairs (kOAO),
(ii) mixed OA site pairs (kOA), and (iii) carbidic A site pairs
(kA). Dehydrogenation rates exhibited near-first order depen-
dences upon propane pressure under most conditions (Fig. S.3)
which can be rationalized by weak interactions of the saturated
hydrocarbon with the oxycarbidic surface at elevated tempera-
tures of 823 K. The rate expression involving dehydrogenation over
all site pairs on the partially oxidized Mo2C surface can be
expressed as follows:
rC3H6

This hypothesized first order alkane dependence and second
order active site dependence for the dehydrogenation rate expres-
sion arises from a weakly adsorbed propyl species interacting with
a proximate site for rate-determining CAH bond scission similar to
the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx
catalysts proposed by Chen and coworkers [3537]. Propane equi-
librium binding constants, derived from a typical Langmuir-
Hinshelwood analysis, and intrinsic rate constants are combined
into the rate constants as written due to the multiple possible
binding sites on the oxycarbidic surface. The proposed rate expres-
sion is not exclusionary amongst prospective mechanisms, yet this
basic two-site dehydrogenation model enables an investigation of
the evolution of the oxycarbidic surface.
Similar to Tu et al. [20], we quantify the oxygen chemical poten-
tial in relation to the effluent ratios of RWGS products as explained
in Section 3.2. Combining quantification of O sites as shown in Eq.
(4) with the rate expression shown in Eq. (5) yields Eq. (6):

Dehydrogenation rate data were kinetically modeled with dif-
ferent combinations of terms shown in equation 6 to determine
the relative reactivity of OAO, OA, and A site pairs. Fig. 5
shows parity plots representing the goodness of fit for multiple
combinations of dehydrogenation rate expression terms shown
in Eq. (6) for >200 propane dehydrogenation rate measurements
under experimental conditions involving (i) no co-feed, (ii) CO2
co-feed, and (iii) H2/CO2 co-feed.
Fig. 5a shows the goodness of fit achieved from fitting dehydro-
genation rates using the rate expression shown in Eq. (6), account-
ing for dehydrogenation on all three site pair combinations, and
kinetic parameters obtained from this data fit are tabulated in
Table 1. Fig. 5b shows the dehydrogenation rate fits when neglect-
ing dehydrogenation events on A site pairs; the inset of Fig. 5b
shows that the model severely underpredicts dehydrogenation
rates measured in absence of a co-feed, demonstrating the neces-
sity of considering dehydrogenation on A site pairs prevalent
on the carbidic surface in absence of O in order to account for non-
zero dehydrogenation rates when using C3H8 only and C3H8/H2
influent mixtures.
Fig. 5d shows the fit of the dehydrogenation data excluding the
kinetic term representing dehydrogenation on OAO site pairs;
the inset of Fig. 5d shows that this model underpredicts rates for
conditions in which C3H8/CO2 mixtures were co-fed. Under C3H8/
CO2 co-feed conditions, dehydrogenation rates were nearly inde-
pendent of inlet CO2 pressure (rC3H6  PCO2
0.13, 0.21 < PCO2 < 10.5 kPa,
Fig. S.4.). PCO2/PCO ratios varied from 20 to 181; this equates to
an O saturated surface (hO > 0:98) when using Eq. (4) in conjunc-
tion with the fitted equilibrium CO2 dissociation constant listed in
Table 1 (KCO2 = 4.5). O-covered surfaces are expected due to the
oxophilicity of molybdenum carbide catalysts, exhibiting O bind-
ing energies on the order of 0.53 eV depending on surface termi-
nation [24,38], and the absence of a reducing H2 co-feed.
Dehydrogenation rates should exhibit a negative order dependence
upon PCO2 within the framework of a two-site dehydrogenation
mechanism under higher CO2 pressures unless dehydrogenation
events occur primarily on OAO site pairs; the strong O binding
energy in conjunction with no observed inhibitive effects of PCO2
under C3H8/CO2 conditions implicate the necessity of dehydro-
genative pathways over OAO site pairs.

ity of dehydrogenation rates in absence of a kinetic term represent-

rates
measured under H2/CO2 co-feed conditions. The concurrent pres-
ence of CO2 and H2 co-feeds typically resulted in PCO2/PCO ratios
of 0.070.6; this corresponds to intermediate O surface coverages
calculated using Eq. (4) (0.24 < hO < 0.73) and to a surface with
appreciable quantities of both O and  sites. This observation
implies that a mixed oxycarbidic surface with both  and O sites
should exhibit the highest propane dehydrogenation rates, corrob-
orated by the fitted rate constants reported in Table 1 (kOA >
kOAO  kA).
Dehydrogenative pathways prevalent on OAO, OA, and A
site pairs are necessary to describe the observed propane dehydro-
genation rates in presence and in absence of H2 and CO2 co-feed
within the framework of a two-site dehydrogenation model. The
proposed model neglects the presence of surface alkyl, hydroxyl,
or alkoxide species; no significant increase in the goodness of fit
upon the introduction of parameters accounting for surface species

genation rate expression in Eq. (6) that incorporates dehydrogena-
tion over all three distinct site pairings on OAMo2C will serve to
guide analysis of reaction rate transients in Section 3.4.

involves temperature-programmed reactions that last on the order
of hours or days due to the concurrent necessity of O removal via
exposure to a reductive atmosphere and incorporation of lattice C
via a carburization agent such as CH4 at elevated temperatures
(873 K) [39]. Extended transients due to changes in catalyst com-
position and structure occur throughout synthesis, pretreatment,
induction periods, or due to changes in reaction conditions
[14,28,31]. Transient induction periods that last on the order of
days prior to achieving steady state were typically observed in this
study because of initial reactant exposure to a fresh carbide at 823
K (Fig. S.5). Similar transients occur with change of reaction condi-
tions or addition/removal of a co-feed.

propane had been stabilized for  300 min in presence of 1.1 kPa
CO2 co-feed, and CO2 co-feed was subsequently removed at rela-
tive time zero of Fig. 6; no other changes were made to the system
for the next 4000 min after CO2 removal.
The propane dehydrogenation rate was unchanged in absence
of CO2 flow for 300 min, and the dehydrogenation rate subse-
quently increased by 5 before decaying down to a stable value
over the course of the next 2000 min. This transient can be
rationalized by evolution in the concentration of OAO, OA,
and A site pairs with time-on-stream. Dehydrogenation was ini-
tially catalyzed entirely by OAO site pairs on the O-saturated
oxycarbidic surface. During the first 300 min, the surface is
reduced by propane, and O is concurrently removed as H2O or
CO. The amount of O removed during this initial 300-min period
in which dehydrogenation rates were unchanged, approximated
by the propylene dehydrogenation rate, was 0.05 O/Mobulk if each
dehydrogenation event results in the stoichiometric removal of
one O. This small quantity of O could be ascribed to supermono-
layer O coverages or surface O replenishment via bulk O diffu-
sion prior to uncovering a non-negligible population of  sites.
Removal of surface O eventually results in availability of car-
bidic  sites, and this exchange effectuates the transition to dehy-
drogenation catalyzed by OA site pairs, shown to have a larger
dehydrogenation rate constant than OAO site pairs as reported
in Table 1. The total supply of O is limited to that occluded within
the bulk during CO2 co-feed due to the removal of the O source at
t = 0, and this O reservoir is slowly depleted via C3H8-induced
reduction. As O supplies are depleted, the surface approaches
the limit of being entirely populated by carbidic  sites, reaching
a steady state dehydrogenation rate catalyzed entirely by A site
pairs.
Rates of CO formation rise and fall in conjunction with propy-
lene rates, and the integrated quantity of O liberated as CO over
the entire duration of the transient is 0.94 O/Mobulk. Assuming
an upper bound of Mo2C surface area to be 100 m2 g1 (typical of
as-synthesized Mo2C [7,31]) leads to a calculated O loss that
would account for 4 monolayers of O (0.25 Mosurface/Mobulk
assuming 1.5  1015 (surface Mo) cm2); oxidation-induced sur-
face area decrease [5] would imply loss of a greater number of
O monolayers, and post-reaction catalyst surface areas were mea-
sured to be 30 m2 g1. This implicates non-negligible oxidation of
bulk Mo under CO2 co-feed conditions for prolonged times at 823
K. Independent experiments showed that bulk MoO3 exhibited
negligible transient behavior after removing CO2 from C3H8/CO2
mixtures; rates were stable and intransient for over 3000 min
(Fig. S.6). The absence of transience in the identical MoO3 experi-
ment demonstrates the necessity of the carbidic structure for bulk
O occlusion and removal as well as variations in reducibility
between bulk Mo-oxides in comparison to oxidized molybdenum
carbides.
The transience observed in Fig. 6 can be quantitatively modeled
with Eq. (7) by assuming that the rate of removal of surface O is
proportional to the surface O fraction:
dhO
dt   hO
s1
;
hOjt0  1
hO  e

s1;
h  1  e

This differential equation, when solved with an initial condition
of an entirely O saturated surface hOjt0  1 yields a temporally
exponentially decreasing surface O fraction with a time constant
of s1. The initial and asymptotic rate limits of Fig. 6 set the values
of kOAO and kA, respectively, and the transience can be fit with a
two-parameter model. Athena was used to fit this transient by
varying s1 and kOA, and the values are reported in Table 1. The
value of kOA obtained from analysis of this transient is in near
quantitative agreement with that obtained from parameter esti-
mation of steady state dehydrogenation rates (Table 1). The data
from Fig. 6 could also be modeled by quantifying hO as the remain-
ing fraction of the total amount of CO evolved from the catalyst as
shown in (Fig. S.7). The values of kOA and s1 extracted from this
fitting method were comparable to the values listed in Table 1.
The data fit of the experimentally obtained propylene synthesis
rate is shown in Fig. 7a. The exponential exchange between surface
O and
 sites is shown Fig. 7b, and the fraction of the total
observed dehydrogenation rate accounted for by each population
of site pairs (OAO, OA, or A) is represented within Fig. 7c;

the introduction of a small fraction of  sites activates dehydro-
genation on OA site pairs which accounts for the bulk of the
observed dehydrogenation during the transient period, causing
the rate to increase. The decay in hO with time via surface reduc-
tion eventually results in an abundance of  sites on the surface,
the prevalence of dehydrogenation on OA site pairs declines,
and the dehydrogenation rate asymptotically approaches the rate
set by the steady state dehydrogenation rate on A site pairs
achieved after the reduction-induced transience nears completion.
Taking the time derivative of the rate expression in Eq. (5),
inputting the expressions for hO and h from Eq. (7), and using
the rate parameters from the fit of the transient rate data in
Fig. 6 allows for calculation of the local rate maximum as a func-
tion of time; this local rate maximum occurs at t  310 min, which
corresponds to hO = 0.51. This model predicts that the maximum
dehydrogenation rate occurs when the surface is half oxidized
allowing for dehydrogenation events to occur most often over
the most active OA site pairs.
A kinetic model based on similar precepts of changes in O cov-
erage can be used to describe transient reaction rate changes
observed upon other reaction condition alterations such as the
one illustrated in Fig. 8. Before relative t = 0 of Figure 8, 6.2 kPa
H2 and 0.23 kPa CO2 were co-fed with C3H8, subsequently CO2
co-feed was removed at t = 0. Dehydrogenation rate transiently
decreased over the course of 500 min while CAC scission rates
to form CH4 concurrently increased and stabilized. Reintroduction
of CO2 co-feed at t  1300 min returned reaction rates to those
observed prior to CO2 removal before relative t = 0. These co-feed
induced temporal rate changes demonstrate (i) the severe inhibi-
tion of hydrogenolysis caused by mild oxidation (0.23 kPa CO2-
induced), and (ii) the prolonged but reversible transience of both
oxycarbidic catalytic dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.
We highlight that upon CO2 reintroduction at t = 1300 min,
dehydrogenation rates are restored on a timescale of 500 min
whereas hydrogenolysis rates are suppressed in 60 min. Intro-
duction of 0.23 kPa CO2 at t = 1300 min is quantitatively slow rel-
ative to the catalyst loading (8.5 lmolCO2 min1 vs. 5700 lmol
Mobulk). Complete stoichiometric uptake of one O per CO2 up to
a value of one O per Mobulk during the transient after CO2 reintro-
duction would take 670 min. This gradual O influx rationalizes
the 500 min timescale for transience in increasing dehydrogena-
tion rate. Conversely, hydrogenolysis rates to form CH4 are largely
suppressed within 60 min of CO2 reintroduction. In a separate
experiment, dehydrogenation rates were stable under flow of 6.2
kPa H2, PCO2 = 1.1 kPa, and PC3H8 = 5.2 kPa; removal of H2 flow
resulted in an oxidation-induced dehydrogenation transient that
stabilized in 130 min (Fig. S.2). This timescale is an upper limit
for the rate of oxidation and could be limited by bulk O diffusion
or by the turnover of propane molecules adsorbed to carbidic sites.
This timescale contrasts sharply with the reductive transients of
5002000 min observed in Figs. 6 and 8. The rapid suppression of
hydrogenolysis rates induced by surface oxidation demonstrate
the severely deleterious effects of O on CAC bond scission path-
ways, evinced by >95% dehydrogenation selectivity under C3H8
reaction conditions lacking H2 co-feed.
The concurrent gradual increase of hydrogenolysis rates to form
CH4 and decrease in dehydrogenation rates observed upon CO2
removal at t = 0 can be ascribed to gradual surface reduction, and
the dehydrogenation rate transient observed in Fig. 8 can be mod-
eled in a similar fashion to that shown in Fig. 7. In this case, prior to
t = 0, a balance of O and  sites is presumed to be established
under H2/CO2 co-feed conditions resulting in an initially oxidized
surface fraction, h0
O, necessary for solving the site balance as a
function of time. Using experimental partial pressures and the
value of KCO2 obtained from fitting steady state dehydrogenation
rates in Section 3.3 in conjunction with Eq. (4) allows for an assess-
ment of h0
O = 0.36. The dehydrogenation transient shown at t = 0 of
Fig. 8 can be modeled with the set of equations in Eq. (8). The
results of the transient dehydrogenation model fit beyond t = 0 of
Fig. 8 are shown in Fig. 9.

initially, the majority of dehydrogenation events occur on OA site
pairs with <6% of dehydrogenation events occurring over OAO
site pairs. The kOA rate constants obtained from the transient
and steady state data fits in Fig. 9, Fig. 7, and Fig. 5 are shown
for comparison in Table 1. The near-equivalence of the values of
kOA calculated from disparate transient and steady-state analyses
bolsters the credence of the three distinct two-site dehydrogena-
tion mechanisms catalyzed by OAO, OA, and A site pairs
proposed in Section 3.3.
It is necessary to analyze the veracity of the temporally expo-
nential treatment of catalyst O removal. As shown in Section S.8
of Supplementary Information, this system does not suffer from
heat or mass transfer limitations. In the discussion that follows,
diffusion will refer to O diffusion within the oxycarbidic crystal
lattice. The rate of O mobility within the carbidic lattice and the
rate of O removal from the catalyst surface are the two relevant
barriers to surface reduction via O removal; the ratio of these
two rates is summarized by the second Damkhler number
DaII  rReaction
rDiffusion

. One extreme is characterized by rapid O surface
removal that is inhibited by comparatively slow bulk diffusion
(DaII  1), and the other extreme is characterized by rapid bulk
diffusion limited by surface-reaction mediated O removal (DaII
 1).
The limit of DaII  1 would imply near instantaneous surface
reduction, ascribing all observed dehydrogenation rate transience
to bulk O diffusion. This would indicate an extended dependence
of surface dehydrogenation reactivity due entirely to far-reaching
electronic effects of the bulk O composition. The timescale of dif-
fusion can be taken as s  L2=D, where L is the relevant length
scale, typically the catalyst particle radius, and D is the diffusion
coefficient of O within the oxycarbidic lattice. A more rigorous
solution to Ficks second law is shown in Section S.9 of Supplemen-
tary Information and confirms the relevance of this diffusive time-
scale. Equating this diffusion timescale to the fitted s values would
imply that (i) the timescales for transience should be independent
of the nature of the gas-phase reductant, and (ii) dehydrogenation
rates on the catalyst surface are affected by electronic effects of the
oxygen content throughout the entire bulk catalyst structure. The
difference in s1 and s2 values (reported in Table 1) obtained via
C3H8- and H2-induced reduction, respectively, implicate the depen-
dence upon the nature of the reductant and thereby bring evidence
against prevalence of the DaII  1 case, especially noting the faster
reduction with H2 as a reductant in comparison to C3H8 (s1/s2 =
4.5). In the case of DaII  1, surface reactivity would be affected
by the integral over the electronic effects of O throughout the bulk
structure, and any irregularities would detract from the ability to
model the transient dehydrogenation rates using a simple expo-
nential model; the goodness of fit of both transient models using
exponential functions also implicates the unlikelihood of the DaII
 1 case.
In the limit of DaII  1, surface O concentrations would be in
quasi-equilibrium with bulk O concentration because of the sur-
face reduction reaction bottleneck. For the DaII  1 case, the sur-
face O concentration would decay exponentially in tandem with
the bulk O concentration, and hO could be effectively modeled
as an exponentially decaying function; this exponentially decaying
model of hO as a function of time under reductive conditions was
used to fit the observed transients in Figs. 7 and 9. If this system is
characterized by DaII  1, then the time constants extracted from
transients should correspond to the rate of reduction of the sur-
face; independent measurements of the timescale of surface reduc-
tion as measured by H2O formation rates under H2/CO2 flow
conditions (Section S.9 of Supplementary Information) were shown
to be comparable to the reduction time constant extracted from
modeling shown in Fig. 9. This analysis implicates that the rate-
determining timescale in relation to catalytic transience induced
by alteration of the gas-phase reductive potential under the
reported experimental conditions is most closely tied to the rela-
tively slow rate of surface reduction, and, that propane dehydro-
genation can be used as a probe reaction to analyze and track
the changes to the catalyst surface site density in situ. The quanti-
tative modeling of the transient evolution of surface O corrobo-
rates the two-site model that was previously used only under
steady state reaction conditions.
3.5. CAC scission pathways
Significant CAC scission is only observed in the form of promi-
nent product selectivity to CH4 and reforming CO upon the addi-
tion of H2 co-feed to flows of C3H8 and C3H8/CO2, respectively.
Scission products are almost entirely suppressed in absence of H2
co-feed. Fig. 10 shows rates of formation of CAC scission products
under 5.2 kPa C3H8/25 kPa H2 flow and the effects of increasing H2
pressure to 105 kPa. Propane conversion transiently increased
from <10% with 25 kPa H2 co-feed up to 100% after 1000 min
exposure to 105 kPa H2 pressure, yielding almost entirely CH4 as
shown in Fig. 10a and b. Fig. 10c shows that increased H2 pressure
initially yields a higher formation rate of C2H6, but the resulting
ethane undergoes sequential hydrogenolysis to form CH4 after
the catalyst is exposed to H2 over the course of this 1000 min
transient. Fig. 10 showcases that (i) CAC scission rates exhibit a
positive order dependence upon H2 pressure with all hydrocarbons
eventually undergoing complete hydrogenolysis to CH4, and that
(ii) changes in the reductive potential of the reactive atmosphere
instigate lengthy catalytic transients which hamper direct investi-
gation of hydrogenolysis kinetics.
Alkane hydrogenolysis mechanisms over supported noble metal
catalysts have been investigated by Flaherty, Bond, and Frennet
[4044]. Hypothesized mechanisms involve a series of quasi-
equilibrated hydrogenation/dehydrogenation steps, yielding a dis-
tribution of dehydrogenated surface alkyl species that undergo
rate-determining CAC bond scission. Flaherty et al. [40,41] investi-
gated ethane and higher hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis over Pt, Rh,

and Ir catalysts at 593653 K both experimentally and computa-
tionally, demonstrating C2H2
 to be the relevant surface species
preceding ethane CAC bond scission at the reported conditions,
yet the authors note variations in rate constants of CAC bond scis-
sion of different C2Hx intermediates, cautioning that the observed
rate is the summation of the rates of scission of all C2Hx interme-
diates with both coverages and rate constants being variable func-
tions of reaction conditions.
Bond and coworkers [42,44] thoroughly explicate the nature of
alkane hydrogenolysis over noble metals, reporting that alkane
hydrogenolysis rates proceed through a maximum as a function
of H2 pressure. Local maxima in ethane hydrogenolysis rates over
Ni and Pd catalysts were experimentally observed and kinetically
modeled by Kristyan et al. [45,46] at H2 pressures below 100 kPa,
exhibiting nearly first order dependences upon H2 pressure for typ-
ical H2 pressures below 40 kPa. Surface alkyl species are dehydro-
genated to excess at low H2 pressures and necessitate addition of
H species to achieve an appreciable surface coverage of the active
species that can undergo CAC scission, thus displaying a positive
order dependence upon H2 pressure. At high H2 pressures, H spe-
cies competitively inhibit the binding of alkanes and over-
hydrogenate surface alkyls past the species that is most likely to
be activated for CAC scission; H2 pressures on the order of MPa
typically constitute the high pressures under which negative
order dependencies are observed. H2 pressures in this study never
exceeded 50 kPa, and so positive order dependencies of CAC scis-
sion rates upon H2 pressures are observed as expected.
Rates of formation of CAC scission products under H2/CO2
co-feed conditions were normalized by H2 pressure and H2-
normalized rates are plotted against the calculated oxidized sur-
face fraction hO (obtained using Eq. (4)) in Fig. 11 to note the effect
of surface O upon hydrogenolysis rates. Hydrogenolysis pathways
are severely inhibited with increasing surface O coverage; all CAC
scission product formation rates are almost entirely suppressed at
hO  0.75. The nearly uniform suppression of products formed
from CAC bond scission as a function of O implicates similar site
requirements and kinetically relevant steps for cleaving CAC bonds
independent of the C3 or C2 active species or the alkyl scavenger
(O, OH, or H).
O-inhibited hydrogenolysis has been reported by Ribeiro and
coworkers [29,47] and Frennet and coworkers [48]. Experimen-
tally, we note the lack of formation of any product alcohols or
ethers. Surface alkoxides would be formed if O sites were capable
of
catalyzing
CAC
hydrogenolysis.
Chen
and
coworkers
[6]
reported that the most energetically favorable route of O removal
from Mo2C surfaces was the recombination of two OH groups to
form and desorb H2O; under similar conditions, alkoxides and
hydroxyl species should analogously recombine to desorb product
alcohols and ethers. The lack of alcohol and ether formation impli-
cates the inability of O sites to catalyze CAC bond scission.
Frennet and Gault [49,50] investigated alkane binding and
hydrogenolysis over noble metals including Pt and Rh, and hypoth-
esized the necessity of ensembles of sites for alkane binding and
subsequent CAC scission; their models predicted that ensembles
of 828 sites are necessary in order to bind the alkane to the sur-
face. O binding to the catalyst surface can be hypothesized to
evenly
litter
a
carbidic
surface
that
is
typically
active
for
hydrogenolysis under reductive conditions as reported by Schaidle
et al. [38] who calculated differential O binding energies that
decreased from 2 eV to 0.46 eV on a progressively oxidized sur-
face using DFT methods. Submonolayer O-coverage could dispro-
portionately impede alkane binding by blocking part of an
ensemble of sites necessary for alkane binding and subsequent
CAC activation steps. These complexities currently dissuade the
development and interpretation of a single rate expression to
model all CAC scission events necessary to convert propane under
diverse H2/CO2 co-feed conditions.
Proposed CAC scission mechanisms are dependent upon much
faster dehydrogenation rates in comparison to CAC scission rates.
This implicates the possibility of a sequential dehydrogenation/h
ydrogenolysis pathway. The >95% selectivity towards alkene for-
mation under conditions of no co-feed or pure CO2 co-feed implies
that hydrogenolysis rates can be neglected in comparison with
dehydrogenation rates for kinetic analysis. Under conditions where
H2 is present in the influent, carbon selectivity to propylene varied
from 16 to 84%. Modeling dehydrogenation rates as the sum of all
carbon converted in order to model a sequential dehydrogenation-
hydrogenolysis pathway yielded similar kinetic fits as discussed in
Supplementary Information Section S.10.
4. Conclusions
Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane
dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities
can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2. Propane dehydrogena-
tion occurs under all conditions while CAC scission is induced by
H2 and inhibited by O. CAC scission events favor CH4 formation
in absence of CO2 and preferentially form CO in presence of CO2
co-feed by reaction of hydrocarbon fragments with O moieties
derived from CO2 decomposition. The oxycarbide catalyzes the
reverse water-gas shift reaction to equilibrium under conditions
of H2/CO2 co-feed, and the equilibrated RWGS reaction product
ratio PCO2/PCO can be used to calculate the fraction of oxidized sur-
face sites, hO. Dehydrogenation can be modeled by a two-site
mechanism with dehydrogenation events being catalyzed by three
distinct site pairs: oxidized OAO site pairs, carbidic A site pairs,
and cooperative OA site pairs. Dehydrogenation catalyzed by

Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in con-
junction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydro-
genation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were
calculated from both transient and steady state models. Catalyst
surface oxidation of oxophilic carbides proceeds rapidly in pres-
ence of CO2, and surface reduction proceeds much more slowly
and is limited by rate of removal of O from the catalyst surface
in presence of a C3H8 or H2 reductant. Occlusion of O and rapid
bulk O diffusion relative to the rate of O-removal via surface
reduction allows for a direct comparison between rates of surface
reduction and time constants extracted from observed dehydro-
genation transients. Presence of H2 co-feed leads to CAC scission,
and O is postulated to inhibit hydrogenolysis pathways that are
dependent upon ensembles of sites to accommodate dehydro-
genated alkyl intermediates that precede CAC scission. Continued
formation of CAC scission products necessitates the presence of
H; excess H leads to formation of primarily CH4, whereas excess
O in presence of H leads primarily to reforming of propane to
form CO.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
