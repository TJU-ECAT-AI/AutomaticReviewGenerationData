[1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[3] "The in situ XANES results revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

[4] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Fe3Pt1 and Fe3Ni1 catalysts showed activity for CO2-ODHP, with Fe3Pt1 demonstrating 32% propylene selectivity at steady state.

2. Oxidation state: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was observed in both Fe3Ni1 and Fe1Ni3 catalysts.

3. Metal interactions: The combination of oxidized Fe with metallic Ni or Pt appears to be important for CO2-ODHP activity.

4. Surface segregation: In the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation, Fe tends to segregate to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonds compared to Ni-O bonds.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the oxidized Fe species participate in C-H bond activation. The oxygen from dissociated CO2 likely helps maintain the oxidized state of Fe during the reaction. 

While the document does not specifically mention Fe2O3/AC catalysts or discuss support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the reducibility of the Fe oxide species and the nature of the support material would play important roles in determining the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：Fe3Pt1和Fe3Ni1催化剂显示出CO2-ODHP活性，其中Fe3Pt1在稳态下表现出32%的丙烯选择性。

2. 氧化态：反应条件下氧化Fe的存在对于通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。这在Fe3Ni1和Fe1Ni3催化剂中都有观察到。

3. 金属相互作用：氧化Fe与金属Ni或Pt的组合对CO2-ODHP活性似乎很重要。

4. 表面偏析：在CO2解离产生的氧存在下，由于Fe-O键比Ni-O键更强，Fe倾向于偏析到表面。

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中氧化Fe物种参与C-H键活化。CO2解离产生的氧可能有助于在反应过程中维持Fe的氧化态。

虽然文档没有具体提到Fe2O3/AC催化剂或详细讨论载体材料，但可以推断Fe氧化物物种的可还原性和载体材料的性质在决定催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的性能方面起着重要作用。
