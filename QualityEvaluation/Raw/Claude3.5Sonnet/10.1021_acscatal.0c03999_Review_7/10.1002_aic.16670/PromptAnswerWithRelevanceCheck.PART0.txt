[1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[3] "The in situ XANES results revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

[4] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Fe3Pt1 and Fe3Ni1 catalysts showed activity for CO2-ODHP, with Fe3Pt1 demonstrating 32% propylene selectivity at steady state.

2. Oxidation state: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was observed in both Fe3Ni1 and Fe1Ni3 catalysts.

3. Metal interactions: The combination of oxidized Fe with metallic Ni or Pt appears to be important for CO2-ODHP activity.

4. Surface segregation: In the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation, Fe tends to segregate to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonds compared to Ni-O bonds.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the oxidized Fe species participate in C-H bond activation. The oxygen from dissociated CO2 likely helps maintain the oxidized state of Fe during the reaction. 

While the document does not specifically mention Fe2O3/AC catalysts or discuss support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the reducibility of the Fe oxide species and the nature of the support material would play important roles in determining the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：Fe3Pt1和Fe3Ni1催化剂显示出CO2-ODHP活性，其中Fe3Pt1在稳态下表现出32%的丙烯选择性。

2. 氧化态：反应条件下氧化Fe的存在对于通过CO2-ODHP途径促进氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。这在Fe3Ni1和Fe1Ni3催化剂中都有观察到。

3. 金属相互作用：氧化Fe与金属Ni或Pt的组合对CO2-ODHP活性似乎很重要。

4. 表面偏析：在CO2解离产生的氧存在下，由于Fe-O键比Ni-O键更强，Fe倾向于偏析到表面。

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中氧化Fe物种参与C-H键活化。CO2解离产生的氧可能有助于在反应过程中维持Fe的氧化态。

虽然文档没有具体提到Fe2O3/AC催化剂或详细讨论载体材料，但可以推断Fe氧化物物种的可还原性和载体材料的性质在决定催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的性能方面起着重要作用。

Fe oxide-based catalysts showed some activity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), but their performance varied depending on the specific composition and reaction conditions. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst demonstrated moderate activity and selectivity towards propylene formation. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was found to be more effective for CO2-ODHP, with the presence of oxidized Fe playing a crucial role in favoring C-H bond cleavage.

The reducibility of the Fe oxide component appears to be an important factor influencing catalytic activity. In the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, the oxidized state of Fe was maintained under reaction conditions, which was determined to be key for the CO2-ODHP pathway. However, in the Fe3Co1 catalyst, the extent of Fe oxidation was lower, resulting in decreased activity and stability.

While the study does not specifically discuss Fe2O3/AC catalysts or support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the support and its interaction with the Fe oxide species would likely affect the reducibility and dispersion of the active sites, thus influencing catalytic performance.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The oxidized Fe species participate in the activation of CO2 and subsequent oxidative C-H bond cleavage of propane. This process likely involves the formation of oxygen species from CO2 dissociation, which then react with adsorbed propane fragments to form oxygenated intermediates. The cycle is completed as the reduced Fe sites are re-oxidized by CO2, allowing the process to continue.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中表现出一定的活性,但其性能因具体组成和反应条件而异。Fe3Pt1催化剂表现出中等的活性和丙烯选择性。Fe3Ni1催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中被发现更有效,其中氧化态Fe的存在对C-H键断裂起着关键作用。

Fe氧化物组分的可还原性似乎是影响催化活性的一个重要因素。在Fe3Ni1催化剂中,Fe的氧化态在反应条件下得以维持,这被认为是CO2-ODHP反应路径的关键。然而,在Fe3Co1催化剂中,Fe的氧化程度较低,导致活性和稳定性降低。

虽然该研究没有具体讨论Fe2O3/AC催化剂或载体材料,但可以推断载体及其与Fe氧化物物种的相互作用可能会影响活性位点的可还原性和分散性,从而影响催化性能。

Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP反应的proposed机理涉及氧化还原循环。氧化态Fe物种参与CO2的活化和随后的丙烷C-H键氧化断裂。这个过程可能涉及CO2解离形成氧物种,然后与吸附的丙烷片段反应形成含氧中间体。随着还原态Fe位点被CO2重新氧化,循环得以完成,使过程得以持续。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the study. The Fe3Pt1 and Fe3Ni1 catalysts showed promising activity for CO2-ODHP. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was found to be crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway.

The study did not specifically discuss Fe2O3/AC catalysts or the influence of support materials on catalytic activity. However, it was observed that the reducibility of the Fe component played a significant role in the catalyst's performance. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which contained oxidized Fe and metallic Ni under reaction conditions, showed good selectivity towards CO2-ODHP.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. The oxidized Fe species are thought to participate in the oxidative C-H bond cleavage step of the CO2-ODHP reaction. This is supported by the observation that catalysts containing oxidized Fe showed higher selectivity towards propylene formation.

It's worth noting that the selectivity differences among various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state, as both CO2-ODHP selective Fe3Ni1 and dry reforming selective Fe1Ni3 catalysts contained oxidized Fe. This suggests that other factors, such as the relative amounts of Fe and Ni, also play a role in determining the catalyst's selectivity.

本研究分析了铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中的性能。Fe3Pt1和Fe3Ni1催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出良好的活性。研究发现，在反应条件下氧化铁的存在对于促进CO2-ODHP途径中的氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。

研究并未特别讨论Fe2O3/AC催化剂或载体材料对催化活性的影响。然而，观察到铁组分的可还原性对催化剂性能起着重要作用。在反应条件下含有氧化铁和金属镍的Fe3Ni1催化剂对CO2-ODHP表现出良好的选择性。

提出的反应机理涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。氧化铁物种被认为参与了CO2-ODHP反应中的氧化C-H键断裂步骤。这一点得到了含氧化铁的催化剂显示出较高丙烯生成选择性的观察结果的支持。

值得注意的是，各种FexNiy催化剂之间的选择性差异并非由氧化态的变化引起，因为CO2-ODHP选择性的Fe3Ni1和干重整选择性的Fe1Ni3催化剂都含有氧化铁。这表明其他因素，如铁和镍的相对含量，也在决定催化剂选择性方面发挥作用。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Fe-containing bimetallic catalysts with Pt or Pd showed ability to produce propylene via CO2-ODHP, but had low conversion rates. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst demonstrated modest activity with 2.6% CO2 conversion and 32% propylene selectivity.

2. Oxidation state: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was observed in Fe3Ni1 catalysts, where metallic Ni coexisted with oxidized Fe.

3. Bimetallic interactions: Different bimetallic combinations affect catalyst performance. Fe3Ni1 showed better performance compared to Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts. The Fe3Co1 catalyst had a lower extent of Fe oxidation compared to Fe3Ni1, which may explain its lower activity and stability.

4. Reducibility: The extent of Fe oxidation appears to play a role in catalyst performance. Higher oxidation of Fe correlates with better activity and stability in CO2-ODHP.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Oxidized Fe species are key to facilitating the oxidative C-H bond cleavage in propane. The ability of Fe to maintain its oxidized state under reaction conditions, while interacting with other metallic components (like Ni or Co), appears to be crucial for the CO2-ODHP pathway.

While the document does not specifically mention Fe2O3/AC or discuss support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the support (in this case, CeO2) plays a role in maintaining the desired oxidation state of Fe and influencing the overall catalyst performance.

铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：含铁的双金属催化剂与Pt或Pd能够通过CO2-ODHP生产丙烯，但转化率较低。Fe3Pt1催化剂表现出适度的活性，CO2转化率为2.6%，丙烯选择性为32%。

2. 氧化态：在反应条件下存在氧化态的铁对于促进CO2-ODHP途径中的氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。这在Fe3Ni1催化剂中观察到，其中金属态Ni与氧化态Fe共存。

3. 双金属相互作用：不同的双金属组合影响催化剂性能。Fe3Ni1比Fe-Co双金属催化剂表现更好。Fe3Co1催化剂的Fe氧化程度低于Fe3Ni1，这可能解释了其较低的活性和稳定性。

4. 可还原性：Fe的氧化程度似乎在催化剂性能中起作用。Fe的氧化程度越高，CO2-ODHP的活性和稳定性就越好。

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。氧化态的Fe物种是促进丙烷中氧化C-H键断裂的关键。Fe在反应条件下保持其氧化态的能力，同时与其他金属组分（如Ni或Co）相互作用，对CO2-ODHP途径似乎至关重要。

虽然文档没有具体提到Fe2O3/AC或详细讨论载体材料，但可以推断载体（在本例中为CeO2）在维持Fe所需的氧化态和影响整体催化剂性能方面起着作用。

The study does not provide detailed information about Fe oxide-based catalysts on activated carbon (AC) support for CO2-ODHP. However, some insights can be drawn from the Fe-containing bimetallic catalysts examined:

Fe oxide-based catalysts showed some activity for CO2-ODHP, with the Fe3Pt1 catalyst demonstrating 32% propylene selectivity. The catalyst reducibility appears to play a key role, as the presence of oxidized Fe was associated with CO2-ODHP selectivity. The extent of Fe oxidation influenced catalyst activity and stability.

The proposed reaction mechanism likely involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Under reaction conditions, Fe tends to segregate to the surface due to strong Fe-O bonding. This suggests that Fe oxide species participate in activating CO2 and abstracting hydrogen from propane to form propylene.

Support materials like CeO2 used in this study can influence the reducibility and oxygen mobility, potentially enhancing catalyst performance. However, specific effects of AC support were not discussed.

Overall, while Fe oxide-based catalysts show promise for CO2-ODHP, further research is needed to optimize their performance and fully elucidate the reaction mechanism on different supports.

提出的反应机理可能涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。在反应条件下,由于Fe-O键强,Fe倾向于偏析到表面。这表明Fe氧化物物种参与活化CO2并从丙烷中提取氢以形成丙烯。

本研究中使用的CeO2等载体材料可以影响可还原性和氧迁移性,可能增强催化剂性能。然而,没有讨论AC载体的具体影响。

总的来说,虽然Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面显示出前景,但还需要进一步研究以优化其性能并充分阐明在不同载体上的反应机理。
