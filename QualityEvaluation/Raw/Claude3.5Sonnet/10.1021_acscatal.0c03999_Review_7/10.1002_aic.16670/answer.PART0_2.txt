[1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "The previously reported Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[3] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[4] "The in situ XANES results revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the study. The Fe3Pt1 and Fe3Ni1 catalysts showed promising activity for CO2-ODHP. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was found to be crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway.

The study did not specifically discuss Fe2O3/AC catalysts or the influence of support materials on catalytic activity. However, it was observed that the reducibility of the Fe component played a significant role in the catalyst's performance. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst, which contained oxidized Fe and metallic Ni under reaction conditions, showed good selectivity towards CO2-ODHP.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. The oxidized Fe species are thought to participate in the oxidative C-H bond cleavage step of the CO2-ODHP reaction. This is supported by the observation that catalysts containing oxidized Fe showed higher selectivity towards propylene formation.

It's worth noting that the selectivity differences among various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state, as both CO2-ODHP selective Fe3Ni1 and dry reforming selective Fe1Ni3 catalysts contained oxidized Fe. This suggests that other factors, such as the relative amounts of Fe and Ni, also play a role in determining the catalyst's selectivity.

本研究分析了铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中的性能。Fe3Pt1和Fe3Ni1催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出良好的活性。研究发现，在反应条件下氧化铁的存在对于促进CO2-ODHP途径中的氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。

研究并未特别讨论Fe2O3/AC催化剂或载体材料对催化活性的影响。然而，观察到铁组分的可还原性对催化剂性能起着重要作用。在反应条件下含有氧化铁和金属镍的Fe3Ni1催化剂对CO2-ODHP表现出良好的选择性。

提出的反应机理涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。氧化铁物种被认为参与了CO2-ODHP反应中的氧化C-H键断裂步骤。这一点得到了含氧化铁的催化剂显示出较高丙烯生成选择性的观察结果的支持。

值得注意的是，各种FexNiy催化剂之间的选择性差异并非由氧化态的变化引起，因为CO2-ODHP选择性的Fe3Ni1和干重整选择性的Fe1Ni3催化剂都含有氧化铁。这表明其他因素，如铁和镍的相对含量，也在决定催化剂选择性方面发挥作用。
