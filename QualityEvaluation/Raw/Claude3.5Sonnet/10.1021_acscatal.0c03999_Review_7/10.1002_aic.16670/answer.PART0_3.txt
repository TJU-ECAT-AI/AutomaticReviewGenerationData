[1] "Fe-containing catalysts with Pt1 and Pd1 were CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their ability to produce propylene, but these combinations exhibited the lowest conversion."

[2] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[3] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[4] "The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts also illustrated a preference to form propylene but have low performance due to deactivation. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst (Figure 9a), which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Fe-containing bimetallic catalysts with Pt or Pd showed ability to produce propylene via CO2-ODHP, but had low conversion rates. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst demonstrated modest activity with 2.6% CO2 conversion and 32% propylene selectivity.

2. Oxidation state: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was observed in Fe3Ni1 catalysts, where metallic Ni coexisted with oxidized Fe.

3. Bimetallic interactions: Different bimetallic combinations affect catalyst performance. Fe3Ni1 showed better performance compared to Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts. The Fe3Co1 catalyst had a lower extent of Fe oxidation compared to Fe3Ni1, which may explain its lower activity and stability.

4. Reducibility: The extent of Fe oxidation appears to play a role in catalyst performance. Higher oxidation of Fe correlates with better activity and stability in CO2-ODHP.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Oxidized Fe species are key to facilitating the oxidative C-H bond cleavage in propane. The ability of Fe to maintain its oxidized state under reaction conditions, while interacting with other metallic components (like Ni or Co), appears to be crucial for the CO2-ODHP pathway.

While the document does not specifically mention Fe2O3/AC or discuss support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the support (in this case, CeO2) plays a role in maintaining the desired oxidation state of Fe and influencing the overall catalyst performance.

铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：含铁的双金属催化剂与Pt或Pd能够通过CO2-ODHP生产丙烯，但转化率较低。Fe3Pt1催化剂表现出适度的活性，CO2转化率为2.6%，丙烯选择性为32%。

2. 氧化态：在反应条件下存在氧化态的铁对于促进CO2-ODHP途径中的氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。这在Fe3Ni1催化剂中观察到，其中金属态Ni与氧化态Fe共存。

3. 双金属相互作用：不同的双金属组合影响催化剂性能。Fe3Ni1比Fe-Co双金属催化剂表现更好。Fe3Co1催化剂的Fe氧化程度低于Fe3Ni1，这可能解释了其较低的活性和稳定性。

4. 可还原性：Fe的氧化程度似乎在催化剂性能中起作用。Fe的氧化程度越高，CO2-ODHP的活性和稳定性就越好。

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。氧化态的Fe物种是促进丙烷中氧化C-H键断裂的关键。Fe在反应条件下保持其氧化态的能力，同时与其他金属组分（如Ni或Co）相互作用，对CO2-ODHP途径似乎至关重要。

虽然文档没有具体提到Fe2O3/AC或详细讨论载体材料，但可以推断载体（在本例中为CeO2）在维持Fe所需的氧化态和影响整体催化剂性能方面起着作用。
