[1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[3] "The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts also illustrated a preference to form propylene but have low performance due to deactivation. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst (Figure 9a), which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability."

Fe oxide-based catalysts showed some activity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), but their performance varied depending on the specific composition and reaction conditions. The Fe3Pt1 catalyst demonstrated moderate activity and selectivity towards propylene formation. The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was found to be more effective for CO2-ODHP, with the presence of oxidized Fe playing a crucial role in favoring C-H bond cleavage.

The reducibility of the Fe oxide component appears to be an important factor influencing catalytic activity. In the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, the oxidized state of Fe was maintained under reaction conditions, which was determined to be key for the CO2-ODHP pathway. However, in the Fe3Co1 catalyst, the extent of Fe oxidation was lower, resulting in decreased activity and stability.

While the study does not specifically discuss Fe2O3/AC catalysts or support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the support and its interaction with the Fe oxide species would likely affect the reducibility and dispersion of the active sites, thus influencing catalytic performance.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The oxidized Fe species participate in the activation of CO2 and subsequent oxidative C-H bond cleavage of propane. This process likely involves the formation of oxygen species from CO2 dissociation, which then react with adsorbed propane fragments to form oxygenated intermediates. The cycle is completed as the reduced Fe sites are re-oxidized by CO2, allowing the process to continue.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中表现出一定的活性,但其性能因具体组成和反应条件而异。Fe3Pt1催化剂表现出中等的活性和丙烯选择性。Fe3Ni1催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中被发现更有效,其中氧化态Fe的存在对C-H键断裂起着关键作用。

Fe氧化物组分的可还原性似乎是影响催化活性的一个重要因素。在Fe3Ni1催化剂中,Fe的氧化态在反应条件下得以维持,这被认为是CO2-ODHP反应路径的关键。然而,在Fe3Co1催化剂中,Fe的氧化程度较低,导致活性和稳定性降低。

虽然该研究没有具体讨论Fe2O3/AC催化剂或载体材料,但可以推断载体及其与Fe氧化物物种的相互作用可能会影响活性位点的可还原性和分散性,从而影响催化性能。

Fe氧化物基催化剂上CO2-ODHP反应的proposed机理涉及氧化还原循环。氧化态Fe物种参与CO2的活化和随后的丙烷C-H键氧化断裂。这个过程可能涉及CO2解离形成氧物种,然后与吸附的丙烷片段反应形成含氧中间体。随着还原态Fe位点被CO2重新氧化,循环得以完成,使过程得以持续。
