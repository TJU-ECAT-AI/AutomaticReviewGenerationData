[1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst (Figure 9a), which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability."

[3] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

The study does not provide detailed information about Fe oxide-based catalysts on activated carbon (AC) support for CO2-ODHP. However, some insights can be drawn from the Fe-containing bimetallic catalysts examined:

Fe oxide-based catalysts showed some activity for CO2-ODHP, with the Fe3Pt1 catalyst demonstrating 32% propylene selectivity. The catalyst reducibility appears to play a key role, as the presence of oxidized Fe was associated with CO2-ODHP selectivity. The extent of Fe oxidation influenced catalyst activity and stability.

The proposed reaction mechanism likely involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Under reaction conditions, Fe tends to segregate to the surface due to strong Fe-O bonding. This suggests that Fe oxide species participate in activating CO2 and abstracting hydrogen from propane to form propylene.

Support materials like CeO2 used in this study can influence the reducibility and oxygen mobility, potentially enhancing catalyst performance. However, specific effects of AC support were not discussed.

Overall, while Fe oxide-based catalysts show promise for CO2-ODHP, further research is needed to optimize their performance and fully elucidate the reaction mechanism on different supports.

这项研究没有提供关于活性炭(AC)负载的Fe氧化物基催化剂用于CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)的详细信息。然而,从所研究的含Fe双金属催化剂中可以得出一些见解:

Fe氧化物基催化剂对CO2-ODHP表现出一定的活性,Fe3Pt1催化剂显示32%的丙烯选择性。催化剂的可还原性似乎起着关键作用,因为氧化Fe的存在与CO2-ODHP选择性相关。Fe氧化程度影响催化剂活性和稳定性。

提出的反应机理可能涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。在反应条件下,由于Fe-O键强,Fe倾向于偏析到表面。这表明Fe氧化物物种参与活化CO2并从丙烷中提取氢以形成丙烯。

本研究中使用的CeO2等载体材料可以影响可还原性和氧迁移性,可能增强催化剂性能。然而,没有讨论AC载体的具体影响。

总的来说,虽然Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面显示出前景,但还需要进一步研究以优化其性能并充分阐明在不同载体上的反应机理。
