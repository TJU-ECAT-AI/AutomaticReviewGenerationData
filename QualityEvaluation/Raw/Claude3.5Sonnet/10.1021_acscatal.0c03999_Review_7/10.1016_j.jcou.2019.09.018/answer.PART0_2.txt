[1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]."

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[3] "Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [10,2731]."

[4] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr (III) has been suggested."

The document does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The literature focuses mainly on chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-PDH (propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2). 

While Fe is briefly mentioned as one of the catalysts investigated for CO2-PDH, there are no details provided about its performance, reducibility, support materials, or reaction mechanisms. The document does not discuss Fe2O3/AC catalysts or the influence of support materials on Fe-based catalysts.

The literature primarily discusses chromium oxide-based catalysts, their high activity and selectivity in CO2-PDH, and proposed reaction mechanisms involving redox cycles of Cr species. Without more specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, it is not possible to provide a detailed analysis of their performance in CO2-ODHP based on this document alone.

该文档没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的具体信息。文献主要集中在CO2-PDH(在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢)的铬氧化物基催化剂。

虽然Fe被简要提及为CO2-PDH研究的催化剂之一，但没有提供关于其性能、可还原性、载体材料或反应机理的详细信息。文档没有讨论Fe2O3/AC催化剂或载体材料对Fe基催化剂的影响。

该文献主要讨论了铬氧化物基催化剂，它们在CO2-PDH中的高活性和选择性，以及涉及Cr物种氧化还原循环的提议反应机理。由于缺乏关于Fe氧化物基催化剂的更具体信息，仅根据这份文档无法提供关于它们在CO2-ODHP中性能的详细分析。
