<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document primarily focuses on chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts, their reducibility, support materials like Fe2O3/AC, or reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The document primarily focuses on Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts, their reducibility, support materials like activated carbon (AC), or any reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

[1] "Many different catalysts were investigated in CO2-PDH containing Pt [3], Ni-Fe [4] Cr [516], Ga [1720], In-Al [2123], Fe [24] or V [25,26]."

[2] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."

[3] "Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed [10,2731]."

[4] "In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr (III) has been suggested."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The document does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The literature focuses mainly on chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-PDH (propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2). 

While Fe is briefly mentioned as one of the catalysts investigated for CO2-PDH, there are no details provided about its performance, reducibility, support materials, or reaction mechanisms. The document does not discuss Fe2O3/AC catalysts or the influence of support materials on Fe-based catalysts.

The literature primarily discusses chromium oxide-based catalysts, their high activity and selectivity in CO2-PDH, and proposed reaction mechanisms involving redox cycles of Cr species. Without more specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, it is not possible to provide a detailed analysis of their performance in CO2-ODHP based on this document alone.

该文档没有提供关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的具体信息。文献主要集中在CO2-PDH(在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢)的铬氧化物基催化剂。

虽然Fe被简要提及为CO2-PDH研究的催化剂之一，但没有提供关于其性能、可还原性、载体材料或反应机理的详细信息。文档没有讨论Fe2O3/AC催化剂或载体材料对Fe基催化剂的影响。

该文献主要讨论了铬氧化物基催化剂，它们在CO2-PDH中的高活性和选择性，以及涉及Cr物种氧化还原循环的提议反应机理。由于缺乏关于Fe氧化物基催化剂的更具体信息，仅根据这份文档无法提供关于它们在CO2-ODHP中性能的详细分析。
