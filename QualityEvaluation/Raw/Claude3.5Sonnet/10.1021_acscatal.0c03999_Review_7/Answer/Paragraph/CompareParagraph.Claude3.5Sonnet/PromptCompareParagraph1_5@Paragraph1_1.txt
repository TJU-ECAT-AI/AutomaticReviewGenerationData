Fe oxide-based catalysts have shown promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts are influenced by several key factors, including catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

Fe2O3/AC (iron oxide supported on activated carbon) has demonstrated superior performance among Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. This catalyst outperforms others in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, while maintaining comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. The enhanced performance of Fe2O3/AC can be attributed to its improved reducibility, which is crucial for catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

The support material plays a significant role in determining catalyst performance. Activated carbon (AC) has been found to enhance the reducibility of Fe2O3, allowing it to undergo a complete reduction process from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO and finally to Fe [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. This improved reducibility is key to the high catalytic performance of Fe2O3/AC compared to other tested catalysts. In contrast, other supports like Î³-Al2O3 and MgO can hinder the reducibility of Fe oxide due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support material.

CeO2 has also been identified as a promising support for Fe-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission enhances the overall catalytic performance [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance over time.

The reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The process consists of two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of active sites on the catalyst surface, maintaining its activity throughout the reaction.

The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway [10.1002/aic.16670]. The extent of Fe oxidation plays a significant role in catalyst performance, with higher oxidation of Fe correlating with better activity and stability in CO2-ODHP.

Bimetallic compositions, such as Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt, have also been studied for CO2-ODHP. These catalysts show different selectivities towards olefins, which can be tuned by adjusting the bimetallic composition of the active sites [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

In conclusion, the superior performance of Fe2O3/AC in CO2-ODHP can be attributed to its improved reducibility and the synergistic effect between Fe oxide and the AC support. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, highlighting the importance of maintaining the appropriate oxidation state of Fe throughout the catalytic process.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The research on Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing catalyst performance. However, there are still areas that warrant further investigation. Future research could focus on:

1. Optimizing the Fe2O3/AC catalyst by fine-tuning the Fe loading, particle size, and AC properties to further enhance its performance and stability.

2. Exploring novel support materials or combinations that can further improve the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide catalysts.

3. Investigating the potential of hierarchical or core-shell structures to combine the benefits of different support materials (e.g., CeO2 for CO2 activation and AC for improved reducibility).

4. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state during the CO2-ODHP reaction.

5. Exploring the potential of Fe-based catalysts for other CO2-assisted reactions, leveraging the knowledge gained from CO2-ODHP studies.

6. Investigating the scalability and long-term stability of Fe2O3/AC catalysts for potential industrial applications in propylene production.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for CO2-ODHP, contributing to more sustainable propylene production processes.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several key factors, including catalyst reducibility, support materials, and reaction mechanisms. Among the various catalysts studied, Fe2O3/AC (iron oxide supported on activated carbon) has shown superior performance in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7].

Catalyst reducibility plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of Fe oxide-based catalysts. Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts, undergoing a complete reduction process from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO and finally to Fe [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. This enhanced reducibility is key to its high catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

The choice of support material significantly influences catalyst performance. Activated carbon (AC) has been found to be particularly effective, enhancing the reducibility of Fe2O3 and contributing to its superior activity [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. In contrast, other supports like Î³-Al2O3 and MgO can hinder the reducibility of Fe oxide due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support material. Additionally, CeO2 has been identified as a promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission, enhancing overall catalytic performance [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle consisting of two main steps:
1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]

This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of active sites on the catalyst surface, maintaining its activity throughout the reaction. The ability of Fe oxide to undergo this redox cycle efficiently is crucial for its effectiveness in the CO2-ODHP process.

The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway [10.1002/aic.16670]. In bimetallic catalysts, such as Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt, the oxidation state of Fe plays a significant role in determining catalyst performance and stability.

Bimetallic compositions can be used to tune the selectivity towards olefins by adjusting the active sites. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. This allows for the optimization of catalyst composition to achieve desired product distributions.

In terms of performance, Fe oxide-based catalysts have shown promising results in CO2-ODHP reactions. Fe2O3/AC outperforms other catalysts in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. However, the specific performance can vary depending on the catalyst composition and reaction conditions. For instance, a Fe3Pt1 catalyst showed moderate activity with 32% propylene selectivity at steady state [10.1002/aic.16670].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The study of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP has revealed the complex interplay between catalyst composition, support materials, and reaction conditions. Future research directions could focus on:

1. Optimizing the synergy between Fe oxide and support materials: While AC and CeO2 have shown promise, exploring novel support materials or composite supports could lead to further improvements in catalyst performance and stability.

2. In-depth investigation of the redox mechanism: Advanced in-situ characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the Fe oxide redox cycle during CO2-ODHP, potentially leading to more efficient catalyst designs.

3. Exploring novel bimetallic and multi-metallic compositions: Building on the success of Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt catalysts, investigating other metal combinations could unveil catalysts with superior activity, selectivity, and stability.

4. Developing strategies to maintain the optimal oxidation state of Fe: As the oxidation state of Fe plays a crucial role in catalyst performance, research into methods to control and maintain the desired oxidation state under reaction conditions could lead to more robust catalysts.

5. Scaling up and process integration: Moving from laboratory-scale studies to pilot-scale testing and exploring the integration of CO2-ODHP processes with existing industrial systems could pave the way for practical applications of these catalysts in sustainable propylene production.
