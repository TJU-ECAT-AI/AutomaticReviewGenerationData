Bimetallic composition: The selectivity towards olefins can be tuned by adjusting the bimetallic composition of the active sites. Different metal combinations (e.g., Fe-Ni, Fe-Pt) favor different reaction pathways. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage.\n\nThe proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves:\n\n1. CO2 activation on the support (particularly effective on CeO2).\n2. C-H bond activation on Fe-based active sites.\n3. Redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe species are reduced by the reactants and re-oxidized by CO2.\n4. Competitive reaction pathways including ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and alkane dry reforming.\n\nFe-doped CeO2 catalysts show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance. The mechanism highlights the importance of the interplay between the Fe oxide species and the support material in determining the overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The deactivation mechanism differs from traditional coking, as evidenced by the presence of small regions with higher Fe content in spent catalysts.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CY00586J"}
