Fe oxide-based catalysts have shown promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts are influenced by several key factors, including catalyst composition, reducibility, and support materials.

Fe2O3/AC (iron oxide supported on activated carbon) has demonstrated superior performance in CO2-ODHP compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts. This catalyst outperforms others in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, while maintaining comparable C3H6 selectivity to bare Fe2O3 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. The enhanced performance of Fe2O3/AC can be attributed to its improved reducibility, which is crucial for the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

The support material plays a significant role in determining the catalyst's performance. Activated carbon (AC) as a support enhances the reducibility of Fe2O3, allowing it to undergo a complete reduction process from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO and finally to Fe [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. This improved reducibility is key to the high catalytic performance of Fe2O3/AC. In contrast, other supports like Î³-Al2O3 and MgO can hinder the reducibility of Fe oxide due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support material.

CeO2 has also been identified as a promising support for Fe-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission enhances the overall catalytic performance [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The process consists of two main steps: (1) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, and (2) reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_7]. This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of the active sites on the catalyst surface, maintaining its activity throughout the reaction.

Bimetallic compositions have also been investigated for CO2-ODHP. Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt catalysts supported on CeO2 have shown promising results [10.1002/aic.16670]. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. The extent of Fe oxidation plays a significant role in catalyst performance, with higher oxidation of Fe correlating with better activity and stability in CO2-ODHP.

Despite the promising performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, challenges remain. Catalyst deactivation has been observed in some cases, particularly with Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts [10.1002/aic.16670]. However, the deactivation mechanism appears to differ from traditional coking, as evidenced by the presence of small regions with higher Fe content in spent catalysts [10.1039/D0CY00586J].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP represents a promising direction in the field of heterogeneous catalysis for alkane activation. The synergistic effects between Fe oxide and various support materials, particularly activated carbon and CeO2, offer opportunities for further optimization of catalyst performance. Future research could focus on:

1. Exploring novel support materials or composite supports that can further enhance the reducibility and stability of Fe oxide species.
2. Investigating the potential of trimetallic or multi-component catalysts to fine-tune the balance between C-H activation and C-C cleavage pathways.
3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state under reaction conditions.
4. Exploring the potential of Fe oxide-based catalysts for other CO2-assisted reactions, such as the activation of longer-chain alkanes or the valorization of biomass-derived compounds.
5. Investigating the scalability and long-term stability of Fe oxide-based catalysts for potential industrial applications in CO2 utilization and olefin production.

These research directions could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goals of CO2 utilization and the development of greener chemical processes.

Fe oxide-based catalysts have garnered significant attention in the field of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their promising performance and potential for sustainable propylene production. The catalytic activity of these materials is heavily influenced by their reducibility and the intricate reaction mechanisms at play. Support materials play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Fe oxide catalysts, with activated carbon (AC) emerging as a particularly effective option. Fe2O3/AC has demonstrated superior activity compared to other supported Fe oxide catalysts, attributed to its unique structural properties and improved dispersion of active sites. The synergistic interaction between the Fe oxide and AC support facilitates efficient electron transfer and promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the CO2-ODHP process. Understanding the complex interplay between the Fe oxide species, support materials, and reaction conditions is key to optimizing catalyst design and advancing the development of more efficient and selective CO2-ODHP processes.
