"Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

"Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

"According to Sugino et al. [14] ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is subsequently reoxidized by CO2:
MeFemOn + CO2 -> MeFemOn+1 + CO"

"The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases. Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon."

"The iron oxide catalyst showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene varying from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C."

"It is clear that the type of support had a stronger influence on the catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as support showing extremely low ash content."

[1] "Fig. 1 and Table 1 show propylene yields on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2 at a temperature range of 873898 K."

[2] "Promoting effects of CO2 on the propylene yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, and Ga catalysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1)."

[3] "In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, propylene yields were 13.2 and 10.8% at 898 K, respectively."

[4] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was two times higher than that in the absence of CO2 at 898 K (Fig. 1)."

[5] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[6] "Fe 6.6 1.6 23.8 4.1 13.1 59.0 5.5 0.8 14.2 3.4 11.8 70.7 2.0"

[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7). H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."

          [2] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."

          [3] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

[1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[3] "The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts also illustrated a preference to form propylene but have low performance due to deactivation. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst (Figure 9a), which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability."

[4] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

[1] "Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2"

[2] "Recently, the effect of oxide supports was also investigated by the same research group highlighting the CeO2 as the most promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission."

[3] "Olefin selectivity was found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites."

[4] "DFT calculations suggested that Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined surface favors C-C cleavage."

[5] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."

[6] "The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites"

[7] "Additional evidence from EDS and TGA of spent Fe-Ni catalyst deactivation showed small regions of higher Fe content as compared to fresh catalyst thus excluding coking as the main deactivation reason."
