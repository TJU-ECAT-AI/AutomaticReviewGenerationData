While the literature focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, some insights can be drawn regarding Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Catalyst Performance: Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly when supported on active carbon and promoted with alkali metal oxides, showed the highest performance in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation. The conversion increased with temperature, reaching 60.7% at 550°C for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation.

2. Influence of Support Materials: The support material significantly influenced catalytic activity, with active carbon being the most effective. Specifically, active carbon with the lowest ash content (D-90) performed best. The type of support had a stronger influence on catalytic activity than the concentration of iron.

3. Catalyst Reducibility: While not explicitly discussed, the proposed reaction mechanism suggests that Fe oxide undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle, implying that catalyst reducibility plays a crucial role in its activity.

4. Reaction Mechanism: An oxidative mechanism was proposed, involving surface ferrite as the active site. The redox cycle of Fe oxide can be represented as:
MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO
This suggests a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism where the lattice oxygen of the iron oxide participates in the reaction.

5. Catalyst Composition: The optimum iron content was found to be 5 wt% in all cases. Additionally, promotion with alkali metal oxides increased catalyst activity.

While these findings provide insights into Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, it's important to note that the specific behavior in propane dehydrogenation may differ and would require further investigation.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study primarily focuses on oxidized diamond-supported catalysts, particularly Cr2O3 and V2O5.

From the limited data presented, Fe oxide catalysts appear to have relatively low activity in CO2-ODHP of propane compared to Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. The propylene yield for the Fe catalyst was only 1.6% in the presence of CO2 and 0.8% in Ar at 873 K, which is significantly lower than the best-performing catalysts.

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, support materials (particularly Fe2O3/AC), or propose a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for CO2-ODHP. These aspects are not addressed in the provided literature.

The study found that CO2 promoted propylene yield for Cr, V, and Ga catalysts supported on oxidized diamond. Specifically, Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed twice the activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence at 898 K. The propylene yields for these catalysts were 13.2% and 10.8% respectively at this temperature.

UV-Vis analysis revealed that CO2 helped maintain a slightly higher oxidation state of V2O5 and Cr2O3 on the catalyst surface compared to reactions without CO2. This suggests that CO2 plays a role in maintaining the oxidation state of the catalysts, which may contribute to their improved performance.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, including the influence of reducibility, support materials, and reaction mechanisms, additional research and information would be required.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC (iron oxide supported on activated carbon), show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The catalyst's reducibility plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity. Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts, which contributes to its superior performance in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield.

          The support material significantly influences the catalyst's performance. Activated carbon (AC) as a support enhances the reducibility of Fe2O3, allowing it to undergo a complete reduction process from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 to FeO and finally to Fe. This improved reducibility is key to the high catalytic performance of Fe2O3/AC compared to other tested catalysts. In contrast, other supports like γ-Al2O3 and MgO can hinder the reducibility of Fe oxide due to strong interactions between the Fe oxide and the support material.

          The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves a redox cycle. The process consists of two main steps:

          1. C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 using lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4
          2. Reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by CO2, which acts as a soft oxidant

          This redox cycle allows for the continuous regeneration of the active sites on the catalyst surface, maintaining its activity throughout the reaction. The ability of the Fe oxide to undergo this redox cycle efficiently is crucial for its effectiveness in the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe oxide-based catalysts show activity in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), with performance influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Different bimetallic combinations (Fe-Pt, Fe-Ni, Fe-Co) affect catalyst performance. Fe3Pt1 showed moderate activity with 32% propylene selectivity, while Fe3Ni1 was described as a promising system for CO2-ODHP.

2. Oxidation state: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was observed in Fe3Ni1 and Fe3Co1 catalysts, where oxidized Fe coexisted with metallic Ni or Co.

3. Reducibility: The extent of Fe oxidation plays a significant role in catalyst performance. Higher oxidation of Fe correlates with better activity and stability in CO2-ODHP. For example, Fe3Co1 showed lower activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1 due to a lower extent of Fe oxidation.

4. Surface segregation: In the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation, Fe tends to segregate to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonds compared to Ni-O or Co-O bonds.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Oxidized Fe species are key to facilitating the oxidative C-H bond cleavage in propane. The ability of Fe to maintain its oxidized state under reaction conditions, while interacting with other metallic components, appears to be crucial for the CO2-ODHP pathway.

While the study does not specifically discuss Fe2O3/AC or support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the support plays a role in maintaining the desired oxidation state of Fe and influencing the overall catalyst performance. The choice of support material would likely affect the reducibility and dispersion of the active Fe oxide species, thus impacting catalytic activity.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several key factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: Fe oxide catalysts undergo redox cycles during the reaction, which is crucial for their catalytic activity. The ability of Fe species to be reduced and re-oxidized plays a key role in the overall performance.

2. Support materials: CeO2 has been identified as a particularly promising support for Fe-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission enhances the overall catalytic performance. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

3. Bimetallic composition: The selectivity towards olefins can be tuned by adjusting the bimetallic composition of the active sites. Different metal combinations (e.g., Fe-Ni, Fe-Pt) favor different reaction pathways. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves:

1. CO2 activation on the support (particularly effective on CeO2).
2. C-H bond activation on Fe-based active sites.
3. Redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe species are reduced by the reactants and re-oxidized by CO2.
4. Competitive reaction pathways including ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and alkane dry reforming.

Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance. The mechanism highlights the importance of the interplay between the Fe oxide species and the support material in determining the overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The deactivation mechanism differs from traditional coking, as evidenced by the presence of small regions with higher Fe content in spent catalysts.
