          [1] "Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2"

[2] "Recently, the effect of oxide supports was also investigated by the same research group highlighting the CeO2 as the most promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission."

[3] "Olefin selectivity was found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites."

[4] "DFT calculations suggested that Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined surface favors C-C cleavage."

[5] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."

[6] "The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites"

[7] "Additional evidence from EDS and TGA of spent Fe-Ni catalyst deactivation showed small regions of higher Fe content as compared to fresh catalyst thus excluding coking as the main deactivation reason."

          The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several key factors:

1. Catalyst reducibility: Fe oxide catalysts undergo redox cycles during the reaction, which is crucial for their catalytic activity. The ability of Fe species to be reduced and re-oxidized plays a key role in the overall performance.

2. Support materials: CeO2 has been identified as a particularly promising support for Fe-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission enhances the overall catalytic performance. The oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts contribute to the formation of stable surface active sites.

3. Bimetallic composition: The selectivity towards olefins can be tuned by adjusting the bimetallic composition of the active sites. Different metal combinations (e.g., Fe-Ni, Fe-Pt) favor different reaction pathways. For example, Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scissoring, while Pt-rich surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over Fe oxide-based catalysts involves:

1. CO2 activation on the support (particularly effective on CeO2).
2. C-H bond activation on Fe-based active sites.
3. Redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe species are reduced by the reactants and re-oxidized by CO2.
4. Competitive reaction pathways including ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and alkane dry reforming.

Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance. The mechanism highlights the importance of the interplay between the Fe oxide species and the support material in determining the overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The deactivation mechanism differs from traditional coking, as evidenced by the presence of small regions with higher Fe content in spent catalysts.

          Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)中的性能受几个关键因素影响：

1. 催化剂的可还原性：Fe氧化物催化剂在反应过程中经历氧化还原循环，这对其催化活性至关重要。Fe物种被还原和再氧化的能力在整体性能中起着关键作用。

2. 载体材料：CeO2被确定为Fe基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中特别有前景的载体。它通过直接C=O键断裂活化CO2的能力增强了整体催化性能。基于CeO2的催化剂的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)有助于形成稳定的表面活性位点。

3. 双金属组成：通过调整活性位点的双金属组成可以调节烯烃的选择性。不同的金属组合（如Fe-Ni，Fe-Pt）有利于不同的反应途径。例如，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而富Pt表面有利于C-C键断裂。

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的proposed反应机理包括：

1. CO2在载体上的活化（特别是在CeO2上效果显著）。
2. C-H键在Fe基活性位点上的活化。
3. Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe物种被反应物还原，然后被CO2再氧化。
4. 竞争性反应途径，包括ODH、逆水气变换反应和烷烃干重整。

Fe掺杂的CeO2催化剂表现出增强的稳定性和有前景的催化性能。该机理强调了Fe氧化物物种和载体材料之间相互作用在决定CO2-ODHP反应整体催化性能中的重要性。失活机制与传统的结焦不同，这从使用过的催化剂中存在Fe含量较高的小区域得到证实。
