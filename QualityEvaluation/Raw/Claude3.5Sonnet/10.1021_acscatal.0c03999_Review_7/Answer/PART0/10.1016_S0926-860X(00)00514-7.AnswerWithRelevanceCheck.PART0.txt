          "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."

"Sugino et al. [14] used iron oxide supported active carbon impregnated with alkaline and alkaline earth nitrates as catalysts in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 in the absence of water. They proposed the oxidative mechanism of the reaction pointing to surface ferrite as an active site."

"According to Sugino et al. [14] ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene by ferrite, which is subsequently reoxidized by CO2:
MeFemOn + CO2 -> MeFemOn+1 + CO"

"The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases. Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon."

"The iron oxide catalyst showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene varying from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C."

"It is clear that the type of support had a stronger influence on the catalytic activity than the concentration of iron. The best results were achieved with active carbon D-90 as support showing extremely low ash content."

          While the literature focuses on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, some insights can be drawn regarding Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Catalyst Performance: Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly when supported on active carbon and promoted with alkali metal oxides, showed the highest performance in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation. The conversion increased with temperature, reaching 60.7% at 550°C for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation.

2. Influence of Support Materials: The support material significantly influenced catalytic activity, with active carbon being the most effective. Specifically, active carbon with the lowest ash content (D-90) performed best. The type of support had a stronger influence on catalytic activity than the concentration of iron.

3. Catalyst Reducibility: While not explicitly discussed, the proposed reaction mechanism suggests that Fe oxide undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle, implying that catalyst reducibility plays a crucial role in its activity.

4. Reaction Mechanism: An oxidative mechanism was proposed, involving surface ferrite as the active site. The redox cycle of Fe oxide can be represented as:
MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO
This suggests a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism where the lattice oxygen of the iron oxide participates in the reaction.

5. Catalyst Composition: The optimum iron content was found to be 5 wt% in all cases. Additionally, promotion with alkali metal oxides increased catalyst activity.

While these findings provide insights into Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation, it's important to note that the specific behavior in propane dehydrogenation may differ and would require further investigation.

          虽然这篇文献主要关注乙苯脱氢而非丙烷脱氢，但我们仍可以从中得到一些关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢中的见解：

1. 催化剂性能：Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是当使用活性炭作为载体并用碱金属氧化物促进时，在CO2辅助脱氢反应中表现出最高的性能。随着温度的升高，转化率增加，在乙苯脱氢反应中，550°C时达到60.7%。

2. 载体材料的影响：载体材料显著影响催化活性，活性炭是最有效的载体。具体来说，灰分含量最低的活性炭（D-90）表现最佳。载体类型对催化活性的影响比铁的浓度更大。

3. 催化剂的可还原性：虽然没有直接讨论，但提出的反应机理表明Fe氧化物在催化循环中经历还原和再氧化过程，这暗示催化剂的可还原性在其活性中起着关键作用。

4. 反应机理：提出了一种氧化机理，涉及表面铁酸盐作为活性位点。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环可以表示为：
MeFemOn + CO2 → MeFemOn+1 + CO
这表明存在Mars-van Krevelen型机理，其中铁氧化物的晶格氧参与反应。

5. 催化剂组成：在所有情况下，最佳铁含量被发现为5 wt%。此外，碱金属氧化物的促进增加了催化剂活性。

虽然这些发现为CO2辅助氧化脱氢的Fe氧化物基催化剂提供了见解，但需要注意的是，在丙烷脱氢中的具体行为可能会有所不同，需要进一步研究。
