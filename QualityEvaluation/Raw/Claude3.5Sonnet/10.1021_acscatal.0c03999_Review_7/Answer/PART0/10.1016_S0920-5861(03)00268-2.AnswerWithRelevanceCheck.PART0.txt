          [1] "Fig. 1 and Table 1 show propylene yields on various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2 at a temperature range of 873898 K."

[2] "Promoting effects of CO2 on the propylene yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, and Ga catalysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1)."

[3] "In the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, propylene yields were 13.2 and 10.8% at 898 K, respectively."

[4] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was two times higher than that in the absence of CO2 at 898 K (Fig. 1)."

          The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study primarily focuses on oxidized diamond-supported catalysts, particularly Cr2O3 and V2O5.

From the limited data presented, Fe oxide catalysts appear to have relatively low activity in CO2-ODHP of propane compared to Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. The propylene yield for the Fe catalyst was only 1.6% in the presence of CO2 and 0.8% in Ar at 873 K, which is significantly lower than the best-performing catalysts.

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, support materials (particularly Fe2O3/AC), or propose a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for CO2-ODHP. These aspects are not addressed in the provided literature.

The study found that CO2 promoted propylene yield for Cr, V, and Ga catalysts supported on oxidized diamond. Specifically, Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed twice the activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence at 898 K. The propylene yields for these catalysts were 13.2% and 10.8% respectively at this temperature.

UV-Vis analysis revealed that CO2 helped maintain a slightly higher oxidation state of V2O5 and Cr2O3 on the catalyst surface compared to reactions without CO2. This suggests that CO2 plays a role in maintaining the oxidation state of the catalysts, which may contribute to their improved performance.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, including the influence of reducibility, support materials, and reaction mechanisms, additional research and information would be required.

          该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)中的性能。该研究主要关注氧化金刚石负载的催化剂,特别是Cr2O3和V2O5。

从有限的数据来看,与Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂相比,铁氧化物催化剂在丙烷的CO2-ODHP中的活性相对较低。在873 K下,铁催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烯产率仅为1.6%,在Ar中为0.8%,远低于性能最好的催化剂。

该文档没有讨论催化剂的可还原性、载体材料(特别是Fe2O3/AC),也没有提出涉及铁氧化物氧化还原循环的CO2-ODHP反应机理。这些方面在所提供的文献中没有涉及。

研究发现,CO2促进了负载在氧化金刚石上的Cr、V和Ga催化剂的丙烯产率。具体来说,在898 K下,Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下的活性是没有CO2时的两倍。这些催化剂在该温度下的丙烯产率分别为13.2%和10.8%。

UV-Vis分析表明,与无CO2反应相比,CO2有助于保持催化剂表面V2O5和Cr2O3略高的氧化态。这表明CO2在维持催化剂氧化态方面发挥作用,可能有助于提高其性能。

要对CO2-ODHP中的铁氧化物基催化剂进行全面分析,包括可还原性、载体材料和反应机理的影响,需要额外的研究和信息。
