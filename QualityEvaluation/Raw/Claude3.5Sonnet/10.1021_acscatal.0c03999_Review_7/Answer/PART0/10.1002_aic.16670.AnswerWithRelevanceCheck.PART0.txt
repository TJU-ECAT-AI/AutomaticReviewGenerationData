          [1] "The Fe3Pt1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[2] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[3] "The Fe-Co bimetallic catalysts also illustrated a preference to form propylene but have low performance due to deactivation. The in situ XANES results revealed that the Fe3Co1 catalyst consisted mainly of metallic Co and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was less than that in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst (Figure 9a), which may be the cause of the observed lower steady state activity and stability."

[4] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O."

          Fe oxide-based catalysts show activity in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), with performance influenced by several factors:

1. Catalyst composition: Different bimetallic combinations (Fe-Pt, Fe-Ni, Fe-Co) affect catalyst performance. Fe3Pt1 showed moderate activity with 32% propylene selectivity, while Fe3Ni1 was described as a promising system for CO2-ODHP.

2. Oxidation state: The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was observed in Fe3Ni1 and Fe3Co1 catalysts, where oxidized Fe coexisted with metallic Ni or Co.

3. Reducibility: The extent of Fe oxidation plays a significant role in catalyst performance. Higher oxidation of Fe correlates with better activity and stability in CO2-ODHP. For example, Fe3Co1 showed lower activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1 due to a lower extent of Fe oxidation.

4. Surface segregation: In the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation, Fe tends to segregate to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonds compared to Ni-O or Co-O bonds.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide. Oxidized Fe species are key to facilitating the oxidative C-H bond cleavage in propane. The ability of Fe to maintain its oxidized state under reaction conditions, while interacting with other metallic components, appears to be crucial for the CO2-ODHP pathway.

While the study does not specifically discuss Fe2O3/AC or support materials in detail, it can be inferred that the support plays a role in maintaining the desired oxidation state of Fe and influencing the overall catalyst performance. The choice of support material would likely affect the reducibility and dispersion of the active Fe oxide species, thus impacting catalytic activity.

          铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)反应中表现出活性，其性能受多个因素影响：

1. 催化剂组成：不同的双金属组合（Fe-Pt、Fe-Ni、Fe-Co）影响催化剂性能。Fe3Pt1显示出中等活性，丙烯选择性为32%，而Fe3Ni1被描述为CO2-ODHP的有前景系统。

2. 氧化态：在反应条件下氧化铁的存在对于促进CO2-ODHP途径中的氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。这在Fe3Ni1和Fe3Co1催化剂中观察到，其中氧化铁与金属Ni或Co共存。

3. 可还原性：铁的氧化程度在催化剂性能中起着重要作用。铁的氧化程度越高，CO2-ODHP的活性和稳定性就越好。例如，由于铁氧化程度较低，Fe3Co1比Fe3Ni1表现出较低的活性和稳定性。

4. 表面偏析：在CO2解离产生的氧存在下，由于Fe-O键比Ni-O或Co-O键更强，Fe倾向于偏析到表面。

提出的反应机理涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。氧化态的铁物种是促进丙烷中氧化C-H键断裂的关键。铁在反应条件下保持其氧化态的能力，同时与其他金属组分相互作用，对CO2-ODHP途径似乎至关重要。

虽然研究没有具体讨论Fe2O3/AC或详细讨论载体材料，但可以推断载体在维持铁所需的氧化态和影响整体催化剂性能方面起着作用。载体材料的选择可能会影响活性铁氧化物物种的可还原性和分散性，从而影响催化活性。
