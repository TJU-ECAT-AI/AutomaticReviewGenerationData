<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or Fe2O3/AC catalysts. The document focuses on Cr2O3-based catalysts supported on various materials like Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane. It does not discuss Fe oxide catalysts or their reducibility, support materials, or reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or Fe2O3/AC catalysts. The document focuses on chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts supported on various materials like Al2O3, active carbon (AC), and SiO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane. It does not discuss iron oxide catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts' performance, their reducibility, support material influences, or proposed reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles based on this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献不包含任何关于Fe氧化物基催化剂、CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)或Fe2O3/AC催化剂的信息。该文档主要关注支持在Al2O3、活性炭(AC)和SiO2等各种材料上的氧化铬(Cr2O3)催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论氧化铁催化剂或它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。因此，我无法根据这份文件提供Fe氧化物基催化剂性能的分析、它们的可还原性、支撑材料的影响或涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的提议反应机制。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts or CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The study focuses on Cr2O3-based catalysts supported on different materials (Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2) for the dehydrogenation of propane. There is no mention of Fe oxide catalysts, their reducibility, or the influence of support materials on Fe2O3/AC. The reaction mechanism discussed in the paper involves Cr2O3 and does not address the redox cycle of Fe oxide. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.
