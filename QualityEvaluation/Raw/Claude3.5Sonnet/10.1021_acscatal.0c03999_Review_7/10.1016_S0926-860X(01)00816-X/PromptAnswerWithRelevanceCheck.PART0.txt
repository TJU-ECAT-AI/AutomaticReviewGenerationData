<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). There is no mention of Fe2O3/AC catalysts, their reducibility, or support materials' influence on catalytic activity. The document also does not describe any reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for this particular reaction. The literature mainly focuses on other catalysts and processes for dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation of ethane and propane, but does not cover the specific aspects asked about Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP.
