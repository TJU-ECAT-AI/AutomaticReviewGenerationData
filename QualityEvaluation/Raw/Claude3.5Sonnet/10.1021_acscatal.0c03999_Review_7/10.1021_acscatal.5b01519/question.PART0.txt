Abstract
Catalytic performance and the nature of surface adsorbates were investigated for high-surface-area ceria during the ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction using CO2 as a soft oxidant. The high surface area ceria material was synthesized using a template-assisted method. The interactions among ethylbenzene, styrene, and CO2 on the surface of ceria and the role of CO2 for the ethylbenzene ODH reaction have been investigated in detail by using activity test, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared and Raman spectroscopy. CO2 as an oxidant not only favored the higher yield of styrene but also inhibited the deposition of coke during the ethylbenzene ODH reaction. Ethylbenzene ODH reaction over ceria followed a two-step pathway: ethylbenzene is first dehydrogenated to styrene with H2 formed simultaneously, and then CO2 reacts with H2 via the reverse water gas shift. The produced styrene can easily undergo polymerization to form polystyrene, which is a key intermediate for coke formation. In the absence of CO2, the produced polystyrene transforms into graphite-like coke at temperatures above 500 C, which leads to catalyst deactivation. In the presence of CO2, the coke deposition can be effectively removed via oxidation with CO2.

Introduction
Styrene is one of the most important chemicals in the petrochemical industry for the production of polymers, including polystyrene and styrenebutadiene rubber. Styrene has been mainly produced by ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of an iron oxide catalyst with excess supply of steam at high temperature (600650 C). Typical catalysts used in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene are KFe2O3 catalysts; (1-4) however, there are a few problems associated with the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, such as the large amount of energy consumption during the process, the low yield of styrene due to thermodynamic limitation of endothermic reaction, irreversible catalyst deactivation, and deposition of dehydrogenated carbonaceous species (i.e., coke). (5, 6) Therefore, an economic and efficient ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process is in high demand. Various methods have been attempted to solve the above-mentioned problems of using steam during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of oxidant has attracted considerable attention because it can be operated at lower temperatures and ethylbenzene conversion would not be equilibrium limited. (7, 8) A variety of oxidizing agents, such as O2, N2O, SO2 and CO2, have been used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to lower the reaction temperature. (5, 9-12) Exploitation of CO2 as a soft oxidant for the commercial catalytic ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene has received enormous interest recently because of several benefits of using CO2 compared with other oxidants. It has been reported that CO2 can act as a soft oxidant as well as diluent. (13) In addition, CO2 stays in the gas form throughout the reaction and so does not need latent heat for vaporization. CO2 can also decrease the partial pressure of reactants more effectively than steam, and it has the highest heat capacity among various gases. (12, 14) In addition, in the presence of CO2, coupling between reverse watergas shift reaction
(1)
and the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation becomes more favorable. (13, 15) However, it has been reported that a small amount of CO2 inhibits the catalytic activity of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation as a result of the decomposition of the active phase of iron oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2. (16, 17) Thus, using CO2 was largely limited in the process for preparing styrene because of its property of deactivating the ferrite compounds. It is necessary to develop a catalyst to retain sufficient activity and selectivity when using CO2 for the styrene production process.
Good performance for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene has been reported for a solid catalyst containing vanadium as an active component, wherein CO2 serves as oxidant and without steam. (6, 10, 14, 18-20) Others also reported that the enhancement effects of the dehydrogenation activity of ethylbenzene were significant with CO2 in the presence of Fe2O3/Al2O3, (21) MnO2ZrO2, (22) and a SBA-15-supported CeO2ZrO2 catalyst. (23) However, the reaction temperature of dehydrogenation over these catalysts is still high (above 500 C). Therefore, developing an efficient catalyst with high activity at lower temperature is still highly desirable.
Ceria is a key component in the formulation of many industrially important catalysts and currently attracts attention in the application of the ODH of ethylbenzene catalysts as a result of its oxygen storage/release capacities. (24) It has been reported that ceria itself could be a good catalyst for ODH of ethylbenzene to styrene by using O2 that helps decrease coking during the ODH reaction. (9) However, there is safety concern using O2, and the styrene selectivity among the products might be low due to over oxidation by O2. CO2 as a soft oxidant might favor the styrene yield over ceria catalyst, and it is much safer than O2. So far, the effect of CO2 in the reaction of the ethylbenzene ODH over the pure ceria catalyst has not been established. In this study, a high-surface-area ceria material was synthesized and was tested for ethylbenzene ODH to styrene using CO2. The role of CO2 for the catalytic performance and coking mechanism has been investigated in detail. We find that the high-surface-area ceria prepared by the template-assisted synthesis method exhibits higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at low temperatures (400500 C) than commercial ceria nanoparticles. CO2 favors ODH reaction through a two-step pathway. Ethylbenzene is first dehydrogenated to styrene, and then CO2 reacts with the H2 byproduct via the reverse watergas shift. In situ DRIFTS and Raman characterization proves that CO2 acts as a soft oxidant not only favoring the low temperature ODH of ethylbenzene over the ceria catalyst, but also inhibiting the coke deposition during the reaction.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
High-surface-area (HSA-) CeO2 was synthesized by a template-assisted synthesis method using a non-ionic block copolymer template (Pluronic P104) as described elsewhere. (25) Typically, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (4.4 g, 10 mmol) and Pluronic P104 (5 g) were dissolved in ethanol. The solution was stirred for 2 h and then cast into a Petri dish. The dish was placed into a preheated oven at 65 C for 24 h and then placed into an oven at 150 C for an additional 24 h. The sample was then calcined in air at 450 C for 4 h. A reference commercially available CeO2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was selected for comparison with the HSA-CeO2.
2.2 Catalyst Characterization
The surface area of the samples, using the multipoint Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) analysis method, was measured by N2 adsorption at 196 C, using an Autosorb-1 Quantachrome flow apparatus. The samples were dehydrated in vacuum at 250 C overnight before surface area measurements. Pure HSA-CeO2 prepared using a Pluronic template-assisted synthesis method yielded a surface area of 202 m2/g, whereas the surface area for the commercial ceria is 40 m2/g.
2.3 Catalytic Reaction
A micro catalysis testing unit of the laboratory scale was utilized for examining the performance of the heterogeneous solid catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 as an oxidant. There was a vertically installed U-tube in the fixed bed reactor made of quartz with 4 mm of internal diameter, 350 mm of length, and the reaction temperature was adjusted within the range of 400500 C by using electric heaters and the programmable temperature controller of an Zeton Altamira (AMI-200) instrument. The dehydrogenation catalyst (100 mg, 6080 mesh) was mixed with 200 mg of quartz beads with a similar size, filled into the reactor, and pretreated for 1 h at 400 C with 5% O2/Ar gas prior to performing a reaction. Liquid ethylbenzene was supplied by means of a motorized syringe pump (New Era pump system, NE1000) into a heated line where it vaporized in the carrier stream. Ethylbenzene was introduced as a reactant (2.2 μmol/min), CO2 as oxidant (5 mL/min), and Ar as the carrier (15 mL/min), giving a total flow rate of 20 mL/min and a CO2/ethylbenzene ratio of 100:1. The reactants had been mixed and preheated at 150 C before the reactant was supplied into the reactor. The reactants and products were analyzed using a continuously sampling quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS; Pfeiffer-Balzers Instruments), followed by a gas chromatograph (Buck Scientific) equipped with a flame ionization detector. For analysis of the products, a HP-innowax column (30 m long, 0.32 mm i.d, and 0.25 μm film thickness) was employed. The main products analyzed were styrene, benzene, toluene, and methane. Other gas products such as H2, CO, and CO2 were monitored by the mass spectrometer. The total carbon balance closed to within 5%.
2.4 In Situ Spectroscopy
Infrared spectra were collected using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer in diffuse reflectance mode (DRIFTS). A Pike Technologies HC-900 DRIFTS cell with nominal cell volume of 6 mL was used. The powder sample (50 mg) was placed in the sample cup with a porous screen at the bottom surface, allowing the gas to uniformly pass through the catalyst from top to bottom. A feed gas mixture, controlled using mass flow controllers, was supplied at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. Prior to DRIFTS measurements of adsorption or reaction, the CeO2 samples were first calcined in a flow of 10% O2/He at 500 C for 0.5 h and then cooled to room temperature. A background spectrum of the calcined sample was recorded in flowing He at each temperature used for analysis. These background spectra were subtracted from subsequent sample spectra obtained at the same temperatures. The DRIFTS spectra were collected from 4000 to 650 cm1, accumulating 100 scans at a 4 cm1 resolution.
For Raman studies, the sample was pretreated in an in situ Raman catalytic reactor (Linkam CCR1000). Raman scattering was collected via a customized ellipsoidal mirror and directed by a fiber optics bundle (Princeton Instruments) to the spectrograph stage of a triple Raman spectrometer (Princeton Instruments Acton Trivista 555). Edge filters (Semrock) were used in front of the UVvis fiber optic bundle to block the laser irradiation. The 442 nm excitation (5 mW at sample) was emitted from a HeCd laser (Melles Griot). A UV-enhanced liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instrument) was employed for signal detection. The Raman reactor sits on an XY stage (Prior Scientific, OptiScan XY system) and translates in raster mode while collecting the spectrum. The fast translation has been shown to be able to minimize any laser damage of the surface adsorbates and the samples. Cyclohexane was used as a standard for the calibration of the Raman shifts.
For both IR and Raman in situ spectroscopy, experiments were performed to investigate the ethylbenzene adsorption, desorption; ODH; and styrene adsorption, desorption. For each experiment, the sample was first calcined (5% O2/Ar, 10 mL/min) at 450 C for 30 min in the in situ cell, and then decreased to room temperature and purged by He or Ar (10 mL/min) for 30 min before exposure to reactants. For styrene experiments, 1 μL of neat styrene was dropped into the catalyst at room temperature prior to re-establishing the purge. A bubbler was used to introduce gas phase ethylbenzene into the reactant stream.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalytic results
The catalytic performance of HSA-CeO2 and of commercial CeO2 was measured under steady state conditions between 400 and 500 C using a CO2/ethylbenzene molar ratio of 100. A pretreated sample was held at a sequence of increasing temperatures, for 2 h at each temperature, and the reactants and products were analyzed repeatedly and averaged. In all cases, the major product in the reaction is styrene (selectivity >80%), accompanied by a small amount of benzene, and toluene as byproducts (<20%). Ethylbenzene conversion (XEB), product selectivity (Sp) and styrene yield (YST), are shown in the following equations:

Pure HSA-CeO2 (Figure 1a) gives a higher ethylbenzene conversion compared with the commercial ceria (Figure 1b) in the whole temperature range. The ethylbenzene conversion increased with temperature over the two catalysts. The highest catalytic performance was obtained at 500 C with ethylbenzene conversion of 85%, styrene selectivity of 90% and yield of 80% over the HSA-CeO2. The reaction rates of ethylbenzene at 450 C based on the surface areas are similar for the two catalysts, as shown in Table 1, which indicates that the main reason for the higher activity and yield of styrene over HSA-CeO2 is the larger surface area of the HSA-CeO2. In previous reports of K promoted-Fe2O3 catalysts, the ethylbenzene conversion was typically measured at higher temperature (580600 C) using steam as a diluent (3, 4) and yielded specific activity of 18 × 103 μmol/(h·g). (4) Although K-Fe2O3 catalysts have higher specific activities under those conditions compared with the HSA-CeO2 (350 μmol/(hr·gm), the lower temperatures and the use of CO2 as a diluent has advantages.

To understand the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, the reaction was also conducted without CO2 for the HSA-CeO2 catalyst. Table 2 compares the catalytic results for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene at 400500 C under steady state in the presence and absence of CO2 in the flow. In the absence of CO2, the dehydrogenation reaction also occurred and produced a lower amount of styrene. This suggests that the direct dehydrogenation reaction of ethylbenzene to styrene occurred over the HSA-CeO2 catalyst; however, both the ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield were increased by the addition of CO2.

Aging tests in CO2 were conducted as shown in Figure 2 for a freshly pretreated HSA-CeO2 at 450 C. Figure 2 shows that although the measured ethylbenzene conversion initially decreased, it stabilized after 2 h, and the styrene yield was nearly constant over the 12 h test. The initial decrease in the apparent conversion may be attributed in part to initial retention of ethylbenzene by surface adsorption, including formation of polystyrene (see below). The nearly stable styrene yield indicates the steady reaction rate without catalyst deactivation.

QMS measurements of the H2 produced during the reaction are shown in Figure 3, and these indicate that H2 was produced during the dehydrogenation reaction over the HSA-CeO2 in both the presence and absence of CO2. However, less H2 was observed at the same temperature when CO2 was present, which might be due to the oxidation of the produced H2 by CO2, that is, a reverse water gas shift reaction. To further confirm this reaction route, we also tested the reverse water gas shift reaction over the HSA-CeO2 by flowing CO2 and H2 over pretreated HSA-CeO2 within the same temperature range used for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. A molar ratio CO/H2 of 2:1 was used with a total flow rate of 25 mL/min and Ar as the carrier gas (100 mg sample; CO2: 1.6%). The observed conversion of CO2 to CO increased with increasing temperature, and the highest conversion of CO2 to CO is around 10% at 500 C, close to the predicted equilibrium value for reverse water gas shift. This result proves that CO2 reacts with H2 via the reverse water gas shift reaction, catalyzed by HSA-CeO2, during the ethylbenzene reaction using CO2 as a soft oxidant.

It has been proposed that (13) ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 may proceed by two routes: namely, one-step and two-step pathways. For the one-step pathway, ethylbenzene is oxidized to styrene with CO2 through the direct interaction of CO2 and ethylbenzene (reaction 5):
For the two-step pathway, ethylbenzene is first dehydrogenated to styrene with H2 formed simultaneously (reaction 6),
and then CO2 reacts with H2 via the reverse water gas shift (reaction 1).
Ethylbenzene dehydrogenation occurs even in the absence of CO2, so reaction 6 must occur. Addition of CO2 enhances the rate, either because reaction 5 becomes accessible or because of a forward shift in reaction equilibrium by the reverse water gas shift reaction. For the one-step pathway (reaction 5), there will be no H2 produced. On the basis of the QMS results, H2 is produced in the ODH process, and more H2 is produced at higher temperatures with the increasing of the ethylbenzene conversion. Coupled with our testing result of the reverse water gas shift reaction, we conclude that the ethylbenzene ODH reaction with CO2 over ceria by the two-step pathway must occur. However, on the basis of the current data, it is not possible to eliminate the possibility that the one-step pathway, reaction 5, may occur simultaneously and the relative importance of these two routes can not be determined.
To further clarify the exact role of CO2 in the ethylbenzene ODH reaction and explain how the CO2 interacts with the surface of the ceria and favors the activity and styrene yield, in situ DRIFTS and Raman studies were further carried out.
3.2 In Situ DRIFTS
3.2.1 Styrene AdsorptionDesorption on HSA-CeO2
Figure 4 shows the infrared spectra of styrene adsorbed onto a calcined sample of HSA-CeO2 at room temperature and followed by sequential heating in He to higher temperatures. The spectrum obtained at room temperature is consistent with adsorbed styrene as observed previously. (26-29) Skeletal CC stretching modes of the aromatic ring occur at 1600, 1540, 1500, 1450, 1200, 1081, and 1020 cm1, (26-28) as indicated by markers in Figure 4. The CH deformation and CH bending of the aromatic ring appeared at 1176 and 1155 cm1. The four bands above 3000 cm1 (30833010 cm1) are assigned to the CH stretches in the adsorbed styrene. (26) The vinyl group of styrene has several characteristic bands: the CH out-of-plane bending modes of the vinyl group, CHCH2 and CHCH2, at 910 and 990 cm1 respectively; their overtones 1820 and 1980 cm1; and the CH in-plane bending modes of the vinyl group at 1400 cm1. (28) The bands at 1370 cm1 is due to the CH2 in-plane bending of the vinyl group. A band of 1629 cm1 is associated with the vinyl υ(CC) of the styrene. (26) The assignment of the 1270 cm1 band is not clear, but it is present at all temperatures, so we assign it to an out-of-plane CH bending, possibly of the aryl H. (27, 28)
Figure 4
Figure 4. DRIFTS spectra of styrene adsorptiondesorption in He over pure HSA-ceria at various temperatures. Reaction conditions: styrene adsorbed on the catalyst at room temperature, followed by purging using He (10 mL/min) at various temperatures.
Heating the adsorbed styrene to 200 C leads to prominent changes in the spectrum. These changes are due to the combined effects of desorption and coupling (oligomerization) to form polystyrene. The strongest evidence for the formation of polystyrene is observed in the CH stretching region, where prominent peaks at 2846 and 2931 cm1 due to the CH2 and CH vibrations of the polystyrene consistent with previous IR data. (30, 31) A new band at 2721 cm1 shows a trend similar to the bands of 2931 and 2846 cm1 and is suggested to be CH stretching of polystyrene. In addition, the peak at 1600 cm1 for styrene shifts to 1595 cm1 and strengthens to form a prominent peak. This feature is also typical of the polystyrene. (31) Styrene persists on the surface but decreases due to desorption and its polymerization. Evidence of styrene is the vinyl υ(CC) (1629 cm1), the bending modes, CHCH2 and CHCH2, (910, 990) and their overtones (1820 and 1980 cm1). Aromatic skeletal modes (1600, 1500, 1450, and 1200 cm1) decrease with temperature due to desorption of styrene and effects of polymerization.
As the temperature is increased to 400 C, the CH stretching bands of the polystyrene (2931, 2846, and 2721 cm1) decrease in intensity. Simultaneously, bands due to vinyl (1980, 1820, 990, and 910 cm1) decrease with increasing temperature and vanish at 500 C. By 500 C, only the bands at 3058, 1595, 1270, and 1155 cm1 persist and are assigned to a highly dehydrogenated carbon (coke) remaining on the surface of the ceria. (32) All features due to vinyl groups disappear, along with all of the CH stretching modes indicative of dehydrogenation of all surface species, consistent with coke.
Summarizing, the above results show that at room temperature most of the styrene adsorbs as monomers, while the result of heating to higher temperatures (200450 C) causes coupling of the styrene to form polymer on the ceria. Styrene monomer is present on the surface throughout this range, as indicated by the persistent vinyl bands. Continued coadsorption of styrene and polystyrene suggests that reverse decomposition of polymer to monomer continues, following reaction 7.
It has been reported that polystyrene can depolymerize to styrene in He in the temperature range of 200450 C during the heating process, (29) which is consistent with our results. After heating at 500 C, no CC band and vinyl group were observed, indicating most of the surface species are polymerized and depolymerization has stopped. The disappearance of the CH2 and CH stretching at 2931 and 2846 cm1 indicates nearly complete dehydrogenation of the alkyl H with possible coupling. Lack of available H prevents desorption and depolymerization, leaving only a highly dehydrogenated carbonaceous adsorbate typical of coke. Details of this will be discussed in the following Raman spectrum.
3.2.2 Ethylbenzene AdsorptionDesorption on HSA-CeO2
The activity results (Table 2) indicate that over HSA-CeO2, the dehydrogenation reaction of ethylbenzene to styrene can occur in the absence of CO2. To clarify the surface interaction of ethylbenzene with ceria in the absence of CO2, infrared spectra were collected for ethylbenzene adsorbed onto HSA-CeO2 at 150 C and followed by heating in He at various temperatures. These are shown in Figure 5. Following adsorption at 150 C, several bands characteristic of ethylbenzene were observed. The CH stretches in the aromatic ring occur at 3058 and 3020 cm1, whereas the bands at 2964, 2931, and 2873 cm1 are due to methyl and methylene CH stretches in the ethyl group. (26) Skeletal CC stretching modes of the aromatic ring are visible at 1600, 1540, and 1500 cm1. (26, 28) Upon subsequent heating to 200 C, several new IR bands appeared or became sharper at 1980, 1820, 1629, 1400, 1370, 1351, 1270, 1176, 1155, and 990 cm1. These bands were all seen in the spectra following styrene adsorption as discussed above and shown in Figure 4. In particular, the bands at 1980, 1820, 1629, and 990 cm1 are associated with the vinyl function of styrene. Appearance of these bands confirms that the direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene occurs over the surface of the HSA-CeO2 catalyst, which is consistent with our activity test results.

The bands due to styrene generally increased in intensity with temperature at 300 C but declined after heating to 400 C or higher. At 500 C, the CH stretching bands are strongly decreased (less so for the aromatic stretch at 3064 cm1). This dehydrogenation is accompanied by a persistent band near 1590 cm1 that can be associated with coke buildup, but several bands remain due to the CC stretches (1595, and 1056 cm1) and CH bending (1176 cm1) of the aromatic ring. Bands at 1351 and 1465 cm1 remain and are assignable to styrene oligomer. (33) This indicates that at higher temperature (500 C), some of the styrene forms oligomers on the surface of the ceria during the direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. A new band of 2127 cm1 appears at temperatures above 400 C, which could be assigned to reduced ceria. (34) We may infer that during the reaction 6 of direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, some H2 was produced with the styrene production. The resulting H2 can react with the surface lattice oxygen on the ceria (reaction 8), leading to reduction of the ceria at temperatures as low as 500 C. (35)

3.2.3 CO2 AdsorptionDesorption on HSA-CeO2
To clarify the role of CO2 in the ethylbenzene ODH reaction and how it interacts with ethylbenzene on ceria, in situ DRIFTS spectra were collected for CO2 adsorption on HSA-CeO2 at 150 C and followed by purging and heating in He at various temperatures. The results are shown in Figure 6. Several IR bands appearing at 1616, 1390, 1290, and 1216 cm1 are assigned to carbonate and bicarbonate formed from CO2 adsorption at 150 C on the ceria surface. (36, 37) These bands decrease in intensity with increasing temperature and become very weak at 400 C. These results prove that CO2 can reactively adsorb on ceria at low temperatures, but these decompose and desorb at higher temperatures. This loss of carbonate may contribute to the increased ODH activity above 400 C because loss of carbonate releases available surface sites for ODH reaction.

3.2.4 Reaction of Ethylbenzene + CO2 over HSA-CeO2.
The reaction between CO2 and ethylbenzene on the surface of HSA-CeO2 was investigated by in situ DRIFTS. Spectra were collected at various temperatures while continuously flowing both ethylbenzene and CO2 over the HSA-CeO2. As can be seen in Figure 7, bands due to gas phase CO2 (2362, 2319 cm1) were observed at 150 C (38) along with features due to carbonates (1616, 1390, 1216 cm1), as seen in Figure 6. Several peaks due to adsorbed ethylbenzene also appeared (1540, 1500, 1270, 1056, and 1020 cm1) at the same time. At temperatures higher than 300 C, new bands assignable to styrene (1980, 1820, 1400, 1370, 1300, 1176, 1155, 990, and 910 cm1) appeared, (39) demonstrating that the ethylbenzene dehydrogenated to styrene while in the presence of CO2. Meanwhile with the elevation of temperature, the bands due to carbonate (1616 and 1216 cm1) gradually disappeared, and bands due to adsorbed ethylbenzene (1595 and 1176 cm1) became clearer. This result shows that both ethylbenzene and CO2 can adsorb on the HSA-CeO2 simultaneously at low temperatures, but the adsorbed carbonates might block the active ceria sites, thus inhibiting ODH reaction at low temperatures. At temperatures of 300 C and higher, the carbonate decomposes and desorbs from the surface of the catalyst, and then the adsorbed ethylbenzene interacts with the ceria to produce styrene. Meanwhile, the band due to the reduced ceria at 2127 cm1 appeared, suggesting that H2 produced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene reacted with the surface oxygen on ceria, causing its reduction. The ethylbenzene first dehydrogenated to styrene and H2, and then the H2 was available to react either with lattice O or with CO2 via the reverse water gas reaction. To further clarify the coking formation during the ODH reaction of ethylbenzene and how CO2 interacts with the coke, in situ Raman spectra was explored.

3.3.1 Styrene AdsorptionDesorption on Ceria in Ar
Raman spectra of adsorbed styrene on HSA-CeO2 were collected at room temperature, followed by desorption in Ar at various temperatures. As shown in Figure 8, the Raman bands of the pure HSA-CeO2 were observed at 345, 466, 556, 592, and 1714 cm1 as a result of second-order transverse acoustic (2TA) mode, F2g mode of the CeO2 fluorite phase, D band due to the presence of oxygen vacancies of reduced ceria, defect-sites-induced D mode, and second-order longitudinal optical (2LO) modes of the ceria, (40) respectively. Raman bands at 1005, 1033, 1185, 1200, 1321, 1417, 1498, 1600, and 1629 cm1 due to the styrene adsorption were observed at room temperature after introducing styrene in Ar while some of the ceria bands (345, 556, 592, and 1714 cm1) were attenuated by the styrene. The observed bands could be assigned to CH bending of an romatic ring (1185, 1200 cm1), the CH and CH2 deformation (1321, and 1417 cm1) (41) CC stretch of the aromatic ring (1005, 1033, 1498, 1600 cm1), and vinyl CC stretches (1629 cm1). (42-45) It is significant that the CC stretching at 1629 cm1 disappeared at temperatures above 200 C because this suggests polymerization. Meanwhile, the CC stretches of aromatic rings (1005, 1498 cm1) increased, the peak at 1600 cm1 shifted to 1595 cm1, and a new band at 1447 cm1 appeared.
The band at 1447 cm1 is usually assigned to polyolefin. (42, 43) Comparison of the spectrum at 200 C to that reported polystyrene (41) confirms the bands of 1005, 1185, 1447, 1498, and 1595 cm1 observed are due to the formation of polystyrene; however, upon heating to 400 C, the bands of polystyrene decreased, while a new band at 1330 cm1 increased in intensity and the band at 1595 cm1 shifted to 1580 cm1, indicating the formation of new species. The bands at 1580 and 1330 cm1 have been reported as graphite-like coke. (28) This suggests that the polystyrene must be the intermediate for the formation of coke on the surface of the HSA-CeO2 at higher temperatures (>400 C). After heating to 500 C, the bands due to polystyrene almost vanished, and the two bands at 1330 and 1580 cm1 were still present, which indicates that polystyrene further dehydrogenated to coke deposited on the ceria surface. These transformations in the adsorbed styrene layer also affected the CeO2 bands, which became clearer after heating to 200 C as a result of partial desorption and polymerization of styrene and then diminished again above 400 C as coke formed on the surface. Combined with our DRIFTS results of styrene adsorptiondesorption, in Figure 4, we have found it is easy for styrene to polymerize and form polystyrene, whereas polystyrene was also able to decompose to styrene monomers in the temperature range of 200450 C, but at temperatures above 500 C, the polystyrene further dehydrogenated to produce coke (reaction 9).

3.3.2 Ethylbenzene AdsorptionDesorption on Ceria in Ar
For comparison, Raman spectra of adsorbed ethylbenzene on HSA-CeO2 were collected at room temperature and then heated in Ar at different temperatures, as shown in Figure 9. After introducing ethylbenzene (0.2%) in Ar over the ceria at room temperature, new Raman bands due to ethylbenzene appeared at 717, 833, 1005, 1167, 1265, 1321, 1391, 1498, 1540, 1567, and 1600 cm1 along with the Raman bands of ceria (345, 466, and 592 cm1). The band at 1167 cm1 is attributable to CH bending of the aromatic ring; the bands at 717 and 833 cm1 correspond to the CCC deformation of the aromatic ring; and bands at 1600, 1567, 1540, 1498, and 1005 cm1 are assigned to the CC stretch of the aromatic ring. (28) Bands 1265, 1321, and 1391 cm1 are due to the CH2 or CH3 deformation. (28, 41, 46) Most of the Raman bands associated with ethylbenzene decreased in intensity with an increase in the temperature due to the desorption of ethylbenzene, whereas the bands at 1321, 1498, and 1567 cm1 initially increased in intensity with temperature (100300 C) and then decreased and disappeared at higher temperatures (>400 C). These three bands can be found in the Raman spectra of styrene adsorption in Figure 8.
In addition, the band at 1567 cm1 has also been reported to relate to conjugated olefin, (43, 47) indicating that new species of styrene might have formed during the heating process of ethylbenzene. At 300 C and above, the band at 1600 cm1 shifted to 1595 cm1, and the bands related to polystyrene, as we discovered in Figure 8 at 1167 and 1498 cm1, were present, implying the formation of polystyrene. Some amount of styrene was formed in the heating process during the ethylbenzene desorption. This is consistent with our DRIFTS results in Figure 5. The produced styrene polymerized and formed some polystyrene on the surface of ceria. However, less coke was formed at 500 C compared with the results from heating styrene shown in Figure 8. This might be due to the lower amount of polystyrene produced during the ethylbenzene desorption. Finally, the effect of heating the ethylbenzene layer causes the Raman D band at 592 cm1 to decrease compared with the 556 cm1 band, the band due to oxygen vacancy sites on reduced ceria. This relative intensity change implies that the H2 evolved during the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process causes the reduction of ceria. This is consistent with our DRIFTS results in Figure 5.

3.3.3 Ethylbenzene Dehydrogenation Reaction on Ceria in CO2 or Ar
To further investigate the role of CO2 in the ethylbenzene ODH reaction, in situ Raman spectra were collected during ethylbenzene reaction with or without CO2 over HSA-CeO2. Figure 10 presents the Raman spectra from ethylbenzene interacting with CO2 at various temperatures. Raman bands appeared, after introducing the ethylbenzene and CO2 mixture at 100 C, that were similar to those seen following ethylbenzene adsorption at 25 C (Figure 9), but in addition, two new bands at 1238 and 1651 cm1 were observed at 100 C that are assigned to carbonates. These bands are related to the DRIFTS bands observed at 1216 and 1616 cm1 (Figure 7) and indicate that both ethylbenzene and CO2 are coadsorbed on the surface. In addition, these two Raman bands vanished upon heating to 200 C, which is consistent with our DRIFTS results. During the temperature elevation process, the bands due to ethylbenzene (717, 833, and 1265 cm1) decreased, and some bands related with styrene (1167, 1321, 1391, 1447, 1498, and 1567 cm1) (42) increased. As the temperature was increased to 400 C, the bands assigned to polystyrene at 1005, 1167, 1321, 1391, and 1498 cm1 were significant while the band at 1600 cm1 shifted to 1595 cm1, signaling the formation of polystyrene. However, no significant graphite-like coke was observed. In addition, as found when heating ethylbenzene in Ar, the band intensity due to the defects sites on ceria (592 cm1) shifted to the oxygen vacancy band (556 cm1) with the temperature increase, indicating that the ceria was reduced by the dehydrogenation process.

Reaction conditions: 0.2% ethylbenzene; CO2, 2.5 mL/min; Ar, 7.5 mL/min as carrier gas passed over the catalyst at 100 C for 30 min, followed by heating in reactants at various temperatures.
For comparison, the in situ Raman spectra during the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction in absence the of CO2 on HSA-CeO2 at different temperatures was collected; the results are shown in Figure 11. After introducing ethylbenzene/Ar over the ceria at 100 C, several Raman bands due to ethylbenzene appeared (711, 821, 1005, 1167, 1265, 1321, 1391, 1498, 1567, and 1600 cm1) along with the bands of ceria (345, 466, and 592 cm1). These Raman bands of ethylbenzene decreased in intensity with the reaction temperature. When the temperature increased to 400 C, several bands related to polystyrene (1005, 1167, 1321, 1391 cm1) were observed, and the band at 1600 cm1 shifted to 1595 cm1, which indicates that some styrene might be produced and further polymerize to form polystyrene during the heating process. These bands of polystyrene vanished at temperatures above 500 C, whereas two new bands at 1330 and 1580 cm1 appeared at higher temperatures (500 C). The two bands have been observed in Figure 8 during styrene desorption and are reported as graphite-like coke. (48) They prove that dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene over ceria in the absence of CO2 results in coke deposited on the surface of the HSA-CeO2. In addition, the peak intensity of ceria at 466 cm1 decreased, possibly due to the buildup of coke, and the band at 592 cm1 shifted to 556 cm1, indicative of reduction of ceria. In contrast, no significant coking was observed in the presence of CO2 during the ODH reaction over HSA-CeO2 at high temperature (Figure 10), which indicates that CO2 helps inhibit deposition of coke on the catalyst.

3.3.4 Oxidation of Coke on Ceria by CO2
In situ Raman spectra of the interaction between CO2 and the coked ceria sample were further explored to clarify the exact role of CO2 in ODH reaction of ethylbenzene. Figure 12 gives the Raman spectra of the coked ceria sample (after ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction in Ar at 600 C) that was oxidized at different temperatures by using CO2 as an oxidant. The bands due to coke (1330 and 1580 cm1) disappeared completely after heating in CO2 at 450 C. Simultaneously, Raman bands due to HSA-CeO2 appeared to be completely restored at 450 C, indicating that the catalyst structure is regenerated by coke removal. This demonstrates that CO2 effectively oxidizes the coke during the reaction and thus inhibits coke build-up on the ceria catalyst.
Figure 12

We may conclude that, in the absence of CO2, coke is formed during the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction over ceria. Introduction of CO2 may enhance the reaction in two ways: First, CO2 may react with the H evolved in the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, by reverse water gas shift reaction, removing H2 from the reaction stream and favoring the dehydrogenation reaction. Second, the CO2 removes coke from the surface of ceria, thereby opening ceria sites. CO2 might interact with ceria and release CO and atomic O, which could oxidize the coke at high temperatures. Pulse experiments indicate that CO2 could also contribute to catalyst oxidation. (49) Alternatively, the CO2 may more rapidly form carbonates as intermediates to the oxidation of the coke. DRIFTS during reaction (Figure 7) showed that the peak at 2127 cm1, characteristic of reduced ceria, is observed at 400500 C. This result indicates that although CO2 mainly oxidizes the produced H2 and the coke, it does not completely oxidize the reduced ceria under reaction conditions.
4 Conclusions
HSA-CeO2 synthesized via a template-assisted synthesis method has been shown to be an active and selective catalyst for ODH reaction of ethylbenzene to produce styrene by using CO2 as a soft oxidant. In the absence of CO2, ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction occurred over the HSA-CeO2, but graphite-like coke was formed on the surface of ceria. In the presence of CO2, the ethylbenzene ODH reaction must follow a two-step pathway in which ethylbenzene is first dehydrogenated to styrene and H2 and then CO2 reacts with H2 via the reverse water gas shift reaction, although the direct ODH of ethylbenzene by CO2 may also be possible. Addition of CO2 not only enhanced the ethylbenzene ODH reaction rate and styrene yield but also helped mitigate the coke deposition during the ethylbenzene ODH reaction. The coke deposit is formed from the polymerization of styrene and further graphitization in the absence of CO2, but in the presence of CO2, the coke is oxidized by CO2 and the deposition is effectively inhibited.
