The literature does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document focuses primarily on Cr2O3 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond for ethane dehydrogenation. 

However, the text does mention that Fe-containing catalysts are known to be active for alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 or steam. It also notes that among various supports tested, Fe2O3 performed better than Al2O3, SiO2, and activated carbon.

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, the influence of support materials on Fe2O3 catalysts, or the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for CO2-ODHP. The information provided is insufficient to fully answer the question as posed.

该文献没有提供关于二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)反应中铁氧化物基催化剂的具体信息。该文档主要关注氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3催化剂用于乙烷脱氢反应。

然而，文中确实提到铁含量催化剂在O2或蒸汽存在下对烷烃脱氢反应是已知的活性催化剂。它还指出，在测试的各种载体中，Fe2O3的性能优于Al2O3、SiO2和活性炭。

该文档没有讨论催化剂的可还原性、载体材料对Fe2O3催化剂的影响，或涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的CO2-ODHP反应机理。所提供的信息不足以全面回答所提出的问题。
