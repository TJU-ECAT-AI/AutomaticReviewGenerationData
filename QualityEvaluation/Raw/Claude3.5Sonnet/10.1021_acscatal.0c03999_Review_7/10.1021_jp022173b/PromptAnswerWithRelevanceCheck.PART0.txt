<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document focuses on Cr2O3 and other metal oxide catalysts supported on oxidized diamond for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. There is no discussion of Fe oxide catalysts, propane dehydrogenation, or the specific topics mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document primarily discusses the dehydrogenation of ethane using chromium oxide catalysts supported on oxidized diamond in the presence of CO2. There is no mention of iron oxide catalysts, propane dehydrogenation, or the specific aspects of catalyst reducibility and support materials like activated carbon (AC) that are asked about in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

<quotes>

[1] "Fe2O3 > Al2O3 > SiO2 > activated carbon."

[2] "Fe-containing catalysts were known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of O2 or steam."

[3] "The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst afforded the highest yield of C2H4 (22.5%) among various oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific information about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The document focuses primarily on Cr2O3 catalysts supported on oxidized diamond for ethane dehydrogenation. 

However, the text does mention that Fe-containing catalysts are known to be active for alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 or steam. It also notes that among various supports tested, Fe2O3 performed better than Al2O3, SiO2, and activated carbon.

The document does not discuss catalyst reducibility, the influence of support materials on Fe2O3 catalysts, or the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide for CO2-ODHP. The information provided is insufficient to fully answer the question as posed.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

该文献没有提供关于二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷(CO2-ODHP)反应中铁氧化物基催化剂的具体信息。该文档主要关注氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3催化剂用于乙烷脱氢反应。

然而，文中确实提到铁含量催化剂在O2或蒸汽存在下对烷烃脱氢反应是已知的活性催化剂。它还指出，在测试的各种载体中，Fe2O3的性能优于Al2O3、SiO2和活性炭。

该文档没有讨论催化剂的可还原性、载体材料对Fe2O3催化剂的影响，或涉及Fe氧化物氧化还原循环的CO2-ODHP反应机理。所提供的信息不足以全面回答所提出的问题。
