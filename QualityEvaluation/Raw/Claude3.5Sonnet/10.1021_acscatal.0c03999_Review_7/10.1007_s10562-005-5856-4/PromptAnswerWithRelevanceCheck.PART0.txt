Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or Fe2O3/AC catalysts. The document focuses on a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss iron oxide catalysts or the specific reaction mechanism you asked about. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the provided information.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or Fe2O3/AC catalysts. The document focuses on a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2. It does not discuss Fe oxide catalysts, their reducibility, support materials, or reaction mechanisms involving Fe oxide redox cycles. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given information.
