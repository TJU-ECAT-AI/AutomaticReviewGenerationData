Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials on catalytic activity. The document appears to be about a different catalyst system (CeO2-ZrO2 supported on Al2O3) and a different reaction (oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene). There is no mention of Fe2O3/AC or the redox cycle of Fe oxide. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

所提供的文献中没有关于Fe氧化物基催化剂、CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）或催化剂可还原性和支撑材料对催化活性影响的任何信息。该文档似乎涉及的是不同的催化剂系统（Al2O3负载的CeO2-ZrO2）和不同的反应（乙苯的氧化脱氢）。文中没有提到Fe2O3/AC或Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
