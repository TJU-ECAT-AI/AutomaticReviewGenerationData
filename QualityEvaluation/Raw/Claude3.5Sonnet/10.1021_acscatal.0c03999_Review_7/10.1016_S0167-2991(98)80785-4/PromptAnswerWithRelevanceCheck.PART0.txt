<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe oxide-based catalysts, CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), or Fe2O3/AC catalysts. The document primarily discusses Cr2O3-based catalysts supported on various materials like Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane. It does not mention Fe oxide catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.
