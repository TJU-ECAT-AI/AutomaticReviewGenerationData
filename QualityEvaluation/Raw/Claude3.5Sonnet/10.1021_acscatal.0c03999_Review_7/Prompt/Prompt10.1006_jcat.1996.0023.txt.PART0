reached a maximum (1.5 wt%) and did not increase further
even at the highest loading of chromium oxide. For CrO3
contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61
steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for
an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%). For even higher CrO3
contents, the increase in this species was much less marked.
Finally, for overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31
was also found, and its content increased linearly with
increasing chromium oxide loading. This species was not
dissolved by the treatment with water.
Also reported in Fig. 1 is the value obtained by first
treating the calcined 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water,
in order to remove the soluble Cr61 selectively, and then
calcining the catalyst again at 6008C. The amount of soluble
Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, which
correspondingly decreased by a similar amount.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
