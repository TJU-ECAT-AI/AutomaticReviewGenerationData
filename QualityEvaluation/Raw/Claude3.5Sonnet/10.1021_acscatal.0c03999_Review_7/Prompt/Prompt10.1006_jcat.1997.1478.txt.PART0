The interaction of methane with unsupported and supported
molybdenum compounds (Mo, MoO2, MoO3, Mo2C, and MoC(1x))
has been investigated at 973 K. ZSM-5 was used as a support. Re-
action products were analyzed using gas chromatography. Changes
in the composition of catalyst samples were followed by X-ray pho-
toelectron spectroscopy. Molybdenum metal and oxides interacted
strongly with methane at 973 K to give H2 (Mo) and H2O and CO2
(oxides), but only a trace amount of ethane. When these compounds
were contacted with ZSM-5, the reaction pathway of methane ini-
tially was the same. Afterward, however, a dramatic change oc-
curred in the product distribution: the formation of ethane, ethy-
lene, and benzene came into prominence. This was particularly the
case when these compounds were highly dispersed on ZSM-5. The
selectivity to benzene was 8085%. XPS analysis of Mo-containing
catalysts demonstrated the formation of Mo carbides during the
catalytic reaction. Unsupported Mo carbides behaved like metal-
lic Mo; the dominant process was the decomposition of methane
to hydrogen and carbon. The deposition of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in a
well-dispersed state, however, produced a very active and selective
catalyst for the conversion of methane into benzene. The results sug-
gest that Mo2C is the active surface species in the Mo-containing
catalysts, which converts methane into ethylene, the primary com-
pound for the production of benzene on the zeolite surface.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recently many attempts have been made to activate
methane under nonoxidative conditions and to convert
it into higher hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds. In
the case of supported Pt metals the dehydrogenation of
methane occurs readily, yielding a small amount of ethane
in addition to the main products, H2, and surface carbon
(18). The subsequent hydrogenation of the most reactive
carbon gives several higher hydrocarbons and even ben-
zene (19). The formation of the latter compounds has been
enhanced byaddingCumetaltoRh/SiO2catalystwhichwas

attributed to the migration of CHx species from the Rh onto
the Cu, and to the ease of the coupling of CHx fragments
on copper surface compared to Rh (9).

attractive results: it appeared that methane can be directly
transformed into aromatic products (1015). Wang et al.
(10) reported 100% selectivity of benzene formation at
7.2% conversion, but details on the calculation of this
value were not given. They assumed that the activation of
methane proceeds via the polarization of the CH4 molecule
on the MoO3, and the reaction of the polarized molecule,
HCH+
3 , on the Brnsted acid sites of HZSM-5 zeolite
(10). In our study the maximum selectivity for benzene for-
mation (taking into account only the C-containing gaseous
products) was 6175% at 973 K and at 2.05.7% CH4 con-
version (11). New findings, not observed in the previous
study (10), were as follows: (i) the reaction is preceded by
an induction period, (ii) the reduction of Mo6+ to a lower
oxidation state occurs and carbon is deposited during the
early stage of the contact of methane with the catalyst,
(iii) the high catalytic activity for methanebenzene con-
version is not restricted to MoO3/ZSM-5, as MoO3/SiO2
and even MoO3/Al2O3 exhibited reasonable activity for
this reaction. Similar features have been observed by Wang
et al. (14). For the selectivity of benzene formation they
obtained values between 60 and 65%. Recently, the con-
version of methane into higher hydrocarbons and benzene
was observed on K2MoO4/ZSM-5 catalyst with somewhat
lower CH4 conversion (1.26.3% at 973 K), but still with
high selectivity (6067%
) of benzene formation (12). In
this case the use of silica as a support led to an almost in-
active catalyst (CH4 conversion is <0.40.1% at 973 K),
which indicates the complex nature of this catalytic sys-
tem. Recently, Chen et al. reported on a more detailed
investigation (15). In this study the reduction of MoO3
and the deposition of carbon were also observed. It was
assumed that a synergistic effect between well-dispersed
molybdenum oxide species and the acidic sites of HZSM-5
is required for the catalysis of dehydrooligomerization of
methane.

AROMATIZATION OF METHANE OVER Mo-BASED CATALYSTS
151
The above features of the reaction of methane and the
initial product formation clearly indicated that methane
strongly interacted with MoO3 at the reaction temperature.
It appeared likely that the active phase for the methane
conversion is produced in the high temperature surface re-
action. XPS analysis of the used catalyst did reveal the re-
duction of Mo6+; the peaks for Mo5+, Mo4+, Mo2+, and Mo0
were identified in the XP spectra (11). Taking into account
the large amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in
the course of the high temperature methane conversion,
we may also reckon with the presence of Mo2C in the cata-
lysts. Recently, Wang et al. (14) identified the formation
of Mo2C from MoO3/ZSM-5 following the methane treat-
ment at 973 K by means of XPS, and we did the same from
K2MoO4/ZSM-5 andfromMoO3/SiO2(12,13).It appeared,
however, that the commercial Mo2C is rather inert toward
the methane decomposition (13).
The present investigation was undertaken to elucidate
the nature of the active surface species involved in the
conversion of methane to benzene over Mo-containing
catalysts. For this purpose the effects of different Mo com-
pounds (metallic Mo, Mo oxides, and carbides) on the ac-
tivation of methane and on the formation of benzene are
examined.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
Catalytic reactions were carried out at 1 atm of CH4 pres-
sure in a fixed-bed, continuous flow reactor consisting of a
quartz tube (20-mm i.d.) connected to a capillary tube (11).
The flow rate was 12 ml/min. Generally 0.5 g of loosely com-
pressed catalyst sample was used. Reaction products were
analyzed gas chromatographically using a Hewlett-Packard
5890gaschromatographandaPorapakQScolumn.Insome
cases the initial interaction between the catalysts and the
reacting gases was followed by mass spectrometry using a
Balzers quadrupole mass spectrometer (type OMS 200).
The methane conversion was calculated from the H2 and
H2O balance. The selectivity values of product formation
represent the fraction of methane that has been converted
to specific hydrocarbon products taking into account the
number of carbon atoms in the molecules.
The XPS measurements were performed in a Kratos
XSAM 800 instrument at a base pressure of 108 Torr us-
ing MgKα primary radiation (14 kV, 15 mA). To compen-
sate for possible charging effects, binding energies (BE)
were normalized with respect to the position of the Si(2p)
peak in SiO2 (BE = 103.4 eV) for supported samples and
to the Fermi-level for the Mo2C. The pass energy was
set at 40 eV, and an energy step width of 50 meV and
dwell time of 300 ms were used. Typically 10 scans were
accumulated for each spectrum. Fitting and deconvolu-
tion of the spectra were made using the VISION software
(Kratos).
The gases used were of commercial purity (Linde). Ar
(99.996%) and H2 (99.95%) were deoxygenated with an
oxytrap. The other impurities were adsorbed by a 5A
molecular sieve at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The
HZSM-5 support was obtained by five times repeated ion
exchange of NaZSM-5 (Si/Al = 55.0) with an aqueous so-
lution of ammonium nitrate (1 M), and calcined in air at
863 K for 5 h. MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by im-
pregnating HZSM-5 with a basic solution of ammonium
paramolybdate to yield a nominal 2 wt.% of MoO3. The
suspension was dried at 373 K and calcined at 873 K for 5 h.
Before catalytic measurements, each sample was oxidized
in an O2 stream at 973 K in situ and then flushed with Ar
for 15 min.
MoO2 was a product of Aldrich. It was also prepared by
the reduction of MoO3 (Aldrich) at 813 K in a thermobal-
ance until a constant weight-loss corresponding to the for-
mation of MoO2 (2 h) was reached. Supported MoO2 was
obtained from 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5 by TPR: the highest
reduction temperature reached was 808 K.
While bulk MoO3 is readily reduced to metallic Mo by
hydrogen at 973 K, similar treatment of supported MoO3
does not give reduction below Mo4+ (16, 17). Supported
Mo in zerovalent state was prepared following the method
of Burwell et al. (16, 17) applied for the preparation of
Mo/Al2O3 · HZSM-5 was dehydroxylated by the gradual
heating of the sample in a dry Ar flow up to about 1173 K
and then Mo(CO)6 was evaporated onto the sample kept at
423 K. This was followed by the decomposition of Mo(CO)6
to Mo(CO)x in an argon stream at 423573 K, and then by
hydrogenation at 973 K. In order to prevent the oxidation
of metallic Mo formed, the preparation was performed in
the catalytic reactor.
Hexagonal Mo2C was prepared by the method of Lee
et al. (18). Briefly, about 0.5 g of MoO3 was heated in
1 : 4 methaneH2 mixture flowing at 300 ml (STP)/min in
a quartz cell with two stopcocks. Preparation temperature
was increased rapidly to 773 K and at 30 K/h between 773
and 1023 K, and maintained at 1023 K for 3 h. Following
the suggestion of Lee et al. (18), the sample was deacti-
vated at 300 K with air, or used in situ for catalytic studies.
The BET surface area of this sample was 9.6 m2/g. Cubic
α-MoC1x(x = 0.450.5) was made by the carburization of
Mo2N powders (19). Mo2N was prepared by TPR between
MoO3 and ammonia (20).
Supported Mo2C catalysts were prepared in the follow-
ing ways. The first was a slurry method. ZSM-5 was sus-
pended in triply distilled water and the fine powder of
Mo2C (prepared as above) was added slowly to a stirred
slurry of ZSM-5. H2O was evaporated while the slurry was
stirred. The solid was homogenized and further dried in
an oven at 403 K and ground to a powder. The powder
was slightly pressed into wafers and calcined in situ. In
another case, Mo2C/ZSM-5 was produced by carburation

of calcined MoO3/ZSM-5 in the catalytic reactor, in a way
similar to that described above for the preparation of bulk
Mo2C. Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts were also prepared by the
decarbonylation of the Mo(CO)6/ZSM-5 sample (obtained
as described above) and carburized in a CH4/H2 mixture
(20% CH4) at 973 K for 2 h (20). A detailed description of
the properties of Mo2C samples can be found in the reviews
of Omaya and Haller (21, 22).
3. RESULTS
3.1. Reactions of Methane on Unsupported MoO3,
MoO2, and Mo0 Metal
In order to detect the primary products of the high tem-
perature interaction of CH4 with Mo compounds, the re-
action was first followed by mass spectrometry. Results are
plotted in Fig. 1A. In the case of MoO3 (0.5 g), the product
formation started after 2 min yielding H2O (amu 18), CO2
(amu 44), and a minor amount of C2H6 (amu 30). Max-
imum rate of their formation was reached at 2025 min.
Afterward, the amount of H2O decreased suddenly while
that of CO2 and ethane only moderately. At the same time,
the evolution of H2 was observed.
Similar products were identified in the reaction of
methane with MoO2 (prepared by the reduction of 0.5 g

MoO3). The difference was that the evolution of H2 was
observed at the very beginning of the reaction.
Powders of Mo metal exhibited less activity toward
methane: the initial products were hydrogen and a small
amount of ethane. The rate of the formation of both com-
pounds decayed by a factor of 20 and 2, respectively, after
20 min (Fig. 1B).
3.2. Reaction of Methane on ZSM-5-Supported MoO3,
MoO2, and Mo0
Mixing of fine powders of MoO3 with ZSM-5 (weight
ratio 1 : 2) caused a dramatic change in the product distri-
bution. In the first stage of the contact of methane with
the catalyst, which lasted up to 3545 min, we observed the
same features as those for unsupported MoO3. Then the
evolutionofH2(mainproduct)started,togetherwiththatof
ethane, ethylene, benzene, and toluene. In the steady state
the conversion of methane was 6.07.5% and the selectivity
to benzene attained 8385%. Similar catalytic performance
was observed when 2 wt.% MoO3 was dispersed on ZSM-5
by the impregnation method. The steady state conversion
(6.07.0%) and the selectivity to benzene (8385%) were
higher on this catalyst than on the 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5
samples prepared in our laboratory in previous studies
(1113).

1 : 2 ratio by the slurry method, and (B) MoO2/ZSM-5 prepared by the partial reduction of 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5 in situ.
When MoO2 was mixed with ZSM-5 by the slurry method
(1 : 2 mol ratio), we obtained a high initial methane conver-
sion (1520%), which decreased to 0.5% in 40 min. During
this active period only H2O, CO2, and CO were formed:
ethylene, ethane, propane, and benzene started to evolve
only after 40 min. The selectivity to benzene in this stage
attains a value of 35% (Fig. 2A).
Preparation of MoO2 in situ on ZSM-5 support (by the
reduction of highly dispersed 2 wt.% MoO3) resulted in a
better catalyst (Fig. 2B). The decomposition of methane
started with a maximum conversion (14%), which de-
cayed to about 7.56.0%. At the beginning of the reaction,
the evolution of H2O, CO2, and CO was observed in this
case as well. Afterward, the rate of hydrocarbon formation
significantly increased. The main hydrocarbon product was
benzene with a constant selectivity of 8085%.
As supported metallic Mo cannot be prepared from the
reduction of MoO3 on supports (16, 17), Mo/ZSM-5 was
produced from the decarbonylation of Mo(CO)6. As this is
a rather complicated procedure, in Fig. 3A we present the
data obtained for the various steps of the preparation of
this catalyst. It shows that the dehydroxylation of ZSM-5 is
fast at 473573 K, but is completed only above 873 K. The
rate of decarbonylation of Mo(CO)6 to Mo(CO)x exhibits
a maximum at 523 K; CO evolution ceases around 573 K.
In the subsequent decomposition of Mo(CO)x in hydro-
gen to metallic Mo, first we observed the evolution of H2O
with Tp = 723753 K, then the formation of methane. The
hydrogenation was continued at 973 K until methane pro-
duction was detected, which took several hours. This pro-
cedure was followed by a flushing out of the hydrogen with
argon for 1530 min. The Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst so formed
exhibited a high initial activity toward methane decompo-
sition at 973 K (Fig. 3B). The conversion, determined from
the amount of hydrogen produced at a reaction time of
3 min, was around 35%. Trace amounts of ethane and ethy-
lene were also detected, but only about 0.057% of the de-
composedmethanewastransformedintothesecompounds.
When the next sample was taken for analysis at 24 min, the
conversionofmethanedroppedto0.25%.Atthesametime,
the rate of ethane production also decreased by a factor of
5, whereas that of ethylene formation increased by a factor
of 4. Afterward, both rates remained practically constant in
the time of methane stream (Fig. 3B). A small amount of
propane was also detected, but benzene was identified only
in trace amounts.
When this sample was oxidized at 973 K after the reac-
tion, we measured an initial methane conversion of 11.5%
and a steady state conversion of 7%. The product dis-
tribution was nearly the same as observed for the 2%
MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst; actually the selectivity to benzene
was somewhat higher, 8586%, and that to toluene was
around 6%. Another feature is that the steady state values
remained constant for several hours.

3.3. Reactions of Methane on Unsupported Mo2C Samples
As reported earlier, Mo2C (Aldrich) exhibited very lit-
tle activity toward the decomposition of methane even at
973 K (12). The initial conversion was very low (0.10.2%)
and decreased further with time.
A higher initial activity was measured for the Mo2C pre-
pared by the method of Lee et al. (18). The reaction started
with a maximum rate (34% conversion at 973 K) which
gradually decayed to a very low value, 0.10.3%. The only
gaseous product was H2. Ethane, the other product ob-
served in the decomposition of CH4 on supported Pt metals
(18), was not formed in detectable amounts. No change
in the product formation occurred after several hours of
reaction. It was observed before that during the prepa-
ration of Mo2C a significant amount of excess carbon is
deposited on Mo2C (18), which may influence its catalytic
performance. This excess carbon can be removed by hy-
drogenation at 873 K. This treatment led to an appreciable
increase in the catalytic activity of Mo2C (the initial conver-
sion of methane attains 68%), but it also decreased with
time. A small amount of ethane was also detected: inter-
estingly, its formation rate exhibited a maximum with time
on methane stream. Variation of the temperature gave the
same picture. The C2H6/H2 ratio at the maximum of ethane
production was about 2.0 × 103 at 943 K, and increased
with the reaction temperature to the value of 6.0 × 103 at
973 K. Figure 4 shows the formation of H2 and C2H6 in
the decomposition of methane at different temperatures.
A new sample was used for each temperature.

The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K pro-
duced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydro-
gen to give methane above 800 K. No other products of the
hydrogenation of this carbon were identified.
Some experiments have been performed with the cubic
MoC1x sample. We obtained a very high initial conversion,
2830%, which subsequently decreased to about 2.0
2.5%. The main product was hydrogen. CO was also pro-
duced initially: its formation practically ceased after 20 min.
Small amounts of ethane and ethylene were also produced
(Fig. 5). The C2Hx/H2 ratio varied between 2.8 × 104 and
6.5 × 104.
3.4. Reactions of Methane on Supported Mo2C
First the catalytic behavior of 2 wt.% Mo2C/ZSM-5 pre-
pared by the slurry method was tested. The conversion of
CH4 at the first point of the product analysis (2 min)
was around 1.0%. In this case only a small amount of
ethane was detected. Afterward, the conversion decreased
to about 0.6% (60 min) and, besides hydrogen, the forma-
tion of all the hydrocarbons identified on the most active
MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts occurred (Fig. 6A). The selectiv-
ity to benzene was around 5355%. When this sample was
treated with hydrogen at 873 K before the catalytic test, to
remove the excess carbon, the conversion of methane deter-
mined after 2 min contact time was about 5%, and ethane,
ethylene, and benzene were also formed at the very begin-

ning of the reaction (Fig. 6B). The conversion of methane,
however, suddenly decreased below 1% at the next analysis
(17 min). At the same time, the rate of ethylene formation
increasedandthatofethaneproductiondecreased.Therate
of benzene production slowly decreased after a transitory
maximum. The selectivity to benzene diminished from 47
to 40% in 120 min.
When the amount of Mo2C was significantly increased
(the Mo2C/ZSM-5 weight ratio was 1 : 2), we observed sim-
ilar picture. The initial conversion of methane on the pre-
reduced catalyst attained 18%, but it decayed soon to 1%.
The product distribution and selectivities were practically
the same as before.
A completely different picture was obtained when Mo2C
was prepared from 2 wt.% MoO3 deposited on ZSM-5 by
the impregnation of molybdenum compound. The induc-
tion period observed for supported MoO3 was missing: the
reaction started with the highest rate. The initial conver-
sion of methane was about 10% which diminished slowly
to 56%. At the very beginning of the reaction CO was
also produced but its amount soon decreased to a low level.
The other products of the reaction of methane were H2,
C2H6, C2H4, and C6H6. The rates of their formation in-
creased with time on stream. The selectivity to benzene
became practically constant after 15 min and reached a
value of 85%. The selectivity to ethane was 1720% and
that to ethylene was below 2%. In Fig. 7 we show the rates
and slectivities of the formation of various products on this
catalyst.
When Mo2C was prepared by decarbonylation and car-
burization of Mo(CO)6 deposited on ZSM-5 we also ob-
tained an active and selective catalyst. The initial conver-
sion of methane was 7.5%, which decayed to 2% in 120 min
(Fig. 8). In addition to hydrogen, the hydrocarbons ethane,
ethylene, propane, benzene, and toluene were produced.
H2O, CO, and CO2 were not detected even in the initial
phaseofthereaction.(Notethatwefoundthesecompounds
when the catalyst sample was prepared not in situ and was
exposed to air.) The selectivity to benzene was high, >85%,
and constant during the experiment. The reoxidized cata-
lyst exhibited the same behavior as MoO3/ZSM-5 prepared
by impregnation. After an induction period, the conversion
of methane attained a value of 1012%.
Similarly as in the previous papers (1015), in the cal-
culation of the selectivities to various products only the
C-containing gaseous compounds were taken into account.
During the CH4 conversion, however, a significant fraction
of CH4 decomposed to carbon. In order to be clear as re-
gards the reaction pathways of CH4, we evaluated quan-
titatively the amount of CH4 transformed into carbon de-
posit and also into hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds.
Data are given in Table 1. It appears that the complete

3.5. Characterization of Mo Catalysts
The surface area of the Mo2C sample prepared by us
is about 4.55.0 times larger than that of the commercial
Mo2C.
All the catalysts used in this study have been character-
ized by XPS measurements before and after the reaction.
Some spectra are presented in Fig. 9. For oxidized, unsup-
ported MoO3 we found the doublet for Mo(3d) at 236.2 and
233.0 eV. The BE for 0(1s) was located at 530.8 eV. When

as for MoO3/ZSM-5 treated in the same way. The situation
was similar when the Mo0/ZSM-5 catalyst was examined
after its use as a catalyst.
In Fig. 9 we also show the XPS spectra for Mo2C sam-
ples received from Aldrich and prepared by us. The binding
energies of Mo(3d5/2) were 228.0 eV (Aldrich) and 227.8
227.6 eV, respectively. A value of 227.9 eV was measured
for the MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst used for CH4 conversion.
Note that these values are slightly lower than obtained
previously for Mo2C prepared by other methods (229.0 eV
(24) and 228.1228.3 (25)), but agree well with the value
(227.8 eV) reported by Wang et al. (14) for Mo2C produced
from MoO3/ZSM-5 during the CH4 conversion into ben-
zene. The C(1s) peaks were relatively broad indicating the
coexistence of several forms of C with different binding en-
ergies. Following the XPS work of Bonzel and Krebs (26)
three C species can be distinguished (24, 25): carbidic car-
bon (283.3 eV), polymeric carbon (284.5 eV) and amor-
phous or graphitic carbon (285.0 eV). For our Mo2C sam-
ples we obtained a value of 283.8 eV, which is close to
the value attributed to Mo2C (14, 24, 25). XPS data for
Mo-containing catalysts used in this study are collected in
Table 2.
4. DISCUSSION
The primary aim of this work was to elaborate the na-
ture of the active surface site involved in the conversion of
methane to benzene over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts. The ba-
sic requirements for that center are to activate the methane
molecule to produce CH3 and CH2 fragments, to exhibit less
activity toward the subsequent decomposition of these CHx
species to carbon, and to promote their couplings to ethane
and particularly to ethylene. Taking into account the high
efficiency of the acidic sites of HZSM-5 in the oligomer-
ization and cyclization reactions (27, 28), it was envisaged
that the transformation of ethylene into benzene is accom-
plished on the ZSM-5 surface (1215). Before making a
final conclusion as regards the active sites and the possible
pathways of the transformation of methane into ethylene,
let us summarize the main findings of previous and present
studies.
4.1. Characteristic Features of the Reaction of Methane
on Mo Oxides and Mo Metal
The results of the present study clearly show that
methane reacts readily with unsupported MoO3 and MoO2
at high temperature to give H2O and CO2. The product for-
mation in the initial stage of the surface reaction can be
described by the overall equation
CH4 + 4Os = CO2 + 2H2O.
[1]
The obvious first step in the activation of CH4 is an oxidative
dehydrogenation process
CH4 + O(s) = CH3 + OH
[2]
followed by the recombination of OH groups
2OH = H2O + O(s)
[3]
and by the oxidation of CH3 species
CH3 + Os = CH + H2O
[4]
CH + 2Os = CO2 + 1
2H2
[5]
by surface oxygen. Competing processes are the dehydro-
genation of CH3 species
CH3 = CH2 + H
[6]
CH2 = CH + H
[7]
CH = C + H
[8]
2H = H2
[9]
as indicated by the evolution of H2.
The respective couplings of CH3 and CH2 species
2CH3 = C2H6
[10]
2CH2 = C2H4
[11]
on molybdenum oxides are negligible as compared to the
oxidation and decomposition steps of CHx fragments, but
become detectable on partially reduced surfaces. In the case
of the Mo metal, the dominant process is the decomposition
of methane to carbon and hydrogen, similarly as on sup-
ported Pt metals (19); only about 78% of decomposed
methane is transfomed into ethane and ethylene.
In all three cases a significant decay in the rate of CH4
reaction and changes in the product distribution were

experienced after the initial interaction of methane with the
catalysts at high temperature. As a result, the formation of
C2H6 and C2H4 in very small amounts was observed.
The above results showed that although Mo oxides and
metallic Mo can activate the CH4 molecule and catalyze its
decomposition, neither of these catalysts alone is selective
enough to produce C2H6 and/or C2H4, the assumed start-
ing componds of benzene and aromatics, in larger quantity
(>1% of decomposing methane).
When Mo oxides were mixed with ZSM-5, or particu-
larly when they were dispersed on the ZSM-5 support,
at the very beginning of the contact of methane with the
catalyst we observed similar features. In the latter stages,
however, the production of hydrocarbons, particularly ben-
zene, with a selectivity of 6080%, came into prominence.
This dramatic change in the catalytic behavior can be at-
tributed to the formation of a new compound from the
catalyst during the high temperature reaction. The situa-
tion was different for Mo0/ZSM-5. In this case the initial
interaction of Mo0 with methane at 973 K was followed
by a drastic deactivation as indicated by the decrease
of CH4 conversion from 35 to 0.25% in 24 min. It ap-
pears that the deposition of coke and/or polymeric car-
bon (18) in a large quantity poisoned the active sites of the
catalyst.
4.2. Catalytic Behavior of Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5
XPS examination of MoOx-containing catalysts sup-
ported by ZSM-5 clearly showed that the oxides are not
only reduced by methane at 973 K, but at least the sur-
face layers of oxides have been transformed into some kind
of Mo carbide. The same holds when the starting catalyst
was Mo0/ZSM-5. The binding energies of Mo(3d) and C(1s)
agree with those obtained for commercial Mo2C and for
Mo2C samples prepared by us. This is not surprising as the
conditions used for the preparation of Mo2C are nearly the
same as applied for the catalytic conversion of methane.
Accordingly, we may assume that the dramatic change in
the product distribution following the strong interaction of
methane with supported Mo oxides is due to the formation
of Mo2C.
In a preliminary study, however, Mo2C exhibited very
little activity toward methane decomposition, and mixing
it with ZSM-5 brought no positive result (13). This Mo2C,
however, was a commercial product of very low surface
area (1.1 m2/g). The use of a more advanced method in
the preparation of Mo2C resulted in a more active catalyst
toward CH4 reactions. However, the dominant process was
still the complete decomposition of methane to give H2, C,
and a small amount of ethane (C2H6/H2 ratio was between
2.0 × 104 and 6.0 × 104). The initial catalytic activity of
Mo2C was greatly enhanced when the excess carbon de-
posited during the preparation was removed by H2 treat-
ment at 873 K (Fig. 4). In this case, however, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the high temperature treatment
with H2 removes not only the excess carbon, but also a frac-
tion of surface carbon of Mo2C, creating very active centers
for the subsequent decomposition of CH4. This latter reac-
tion restores the surface stoichiometry of Mo2C leading to
a much less active catalyst. The fact that MoC1x was found
to be considerably more active in the decomposition of CH4
(Fig. 5) than the Mo2C may support this speculation. The
catalytic activity of this sample, however, also soon dimin-
ished. Coupling reactions of CHx species were very limited
on this sample, too.
The situation was completely different when Mo2C was
added to ZSM-5 or deposited on its surface. In these cases,
in addition to H2, we detected all the hydrocarbons (ethy-
lene, ethane, benzene, and small amounts of propane and
toluene), the formation of which was observed on the highly
active 2 wt.% MoO3/ZSM-5 catalyst. As in these cases the
Mo2C samples were prepared by the carburization of sup-
ported or unsupported MoO3, one can assume that the high
catalytic performance of Mo2C/ZSM-5 samples is due to the
presence of unreacted MoO3 and/or Mo2C/MoOx contact.
This idea was apparently supported by the observation that
a partial oxidation of a less active Mo2C mixed with ZSM-5
improved the yield of hydrocarbons and benzene produced
(13). However, in the present case, we could not identify
the formation of H2O and CO2 even at the beginning of the
reaction. Therefore, we can exclude the dominant role of
MoO3 in the catalytic performance of Mo2C/ZSM-5.
This conclusion may be supported by the results obtained
for Mo2C/ZSM-5 prepared in situ by decarbonylation and
carburization of Mo(CO)6 (Fig. 8). This sample also proved
to be an active and selective catalyst in the conversion of
methane into benzene. In this case we cannot count on the
presence of Mo oxides, although if the reactive OH groups
of the support are not removed completely, 2σOMo2+
species can be transitorily formed during the preparation
in the reaction
2σOH + Mo(CO)3 2σOMo2+ + 3CO + H2, (12)
as it was postulated for alumina (17). However, we did not
find H2O, CO, and CO2 in the reaction products which sug-
gests that the MoO species was not present.
Accordingly, we may conclude that Mo2C on the ZSM-5,
produced by the transformation of highly dispersed MoO3,
is the active site for the cleavage of the CH bond in the
methane molecule, but it is far less active for the further
decomposition of CH3 and CH2 species produced. As a re-
sult, these radicals have a certain lifetime to recombine into
C2H6 and C2H4 either on the catalyst surface or in the gas
phase. Further reactions, the oligomerization and aroma-
tization of ethylene, occur on the ZSM-5 support (1215,
27, 28).

5. CONCLUSIONS
1. MoO3 and MoO2 interact strongly with methane at
973 K to give H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene
and ethane. The reaction of methane on metallic Mo pro-
duces H2 with a very small amount of ethane. The catalyst
is soon poisoned due to carbon deposition.
2. Mixing of these compounds with ZSM-5 changes the
product distribution, and the formation of ethylene, ethane,
and benzene comes into prominence. High selectivity to
benzene was attained when these Mo compounds were dis-
persed on ZSM-5.
3. XPS results suggest that the major part of molybdenum
metalandoxidesistransformedintoMocarbidesduringthe
high temperature reaction with methane.
4. Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) catalyzed the de-
composition of methane to hydrogen, carbon, and to a mi-
nor amount of ethane.
5. Preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in high dispersion pro-
duced catalyst which is active and selective in the aroma-
tization of methane (selectivity to benzene is 8085% at a
conversion of 6.07.0%). It appears that Mo2C is respon-
sible for the production of ethylene from methane which
is converted to benzene on the acidic sites of the ZSM-5
support.
