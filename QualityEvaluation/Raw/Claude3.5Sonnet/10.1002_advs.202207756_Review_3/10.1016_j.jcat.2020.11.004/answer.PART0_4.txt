[1] "Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[2] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."

[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites"

[4] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56"

[5] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C"

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts:

1. At low Si/Al ratios (higher Al content), there is a higher probability of paired Brønsted acid sites (BAS). Ga+ preferentially exchanges with these paired sites to form Ga+H+ pair sites.

2. At high Si/Al ratios, isolated BAS are more common, leading to the formation of isolated Ga+ species upon exchange.

3. The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is only possible on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites. This is evident from the lack of GaHx spectral features on high Si/Al ratio samples (Si/Al = 39) even at high Ga loadings.

4. The intensity of GaHx species (particularly GaH2) increases linearly with Ga loading at low Ga/Al ratios, then levels off when Ga/Al exceeds 0.1, and slowly declines at Ga/Al ratios above 0.56.

5. The different behaviors of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites suggest they may have distinct catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are likely influenced by the distribution of Ga species, which is in turn determined by the zeolite's Al distribution and Ga loading. The ability to form GaHx species, which is exclusive to Ga+H+ pair sites, may play a crucial role in the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度对Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质有显著影响：

1. 在低Si/Al比率（较高Al含量）下，成对的Brønsted酸位点（BAS）的概率较高。Ga+优先与这些成对位点交换，形成Ga+H+对位点。

2. 在高Si/Al比率下，孤立的BAS更常见，导致交换后形成孤立的Ga+物种。

3. 镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成仅在Ga+H+对位点上可能，而在孤立的Ga+位点上不可能。这从高Si/Al比率样品（Si/Al = 39）即使在高Ga负载下也没有GaHx光谱特征可以看出。

4. GaHx物种（特别是GaH2）的强度在低Ga/Al比率下随Ga负载线性增加，然后在Ga/Al超过0.1时趋于平缓，在Ga/Al比率高于0.56时缓慢下降。

5. Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+位点的不同行为表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化性质。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性可能受到Ga物种分布的影响，而Ga物种分布又由沸石的Al分布和Ga负载量决定。形成GaHx物种的能力（仅限于Ga+H+对位点）可能在催化剂的活性和选择性中起着关键作用。
