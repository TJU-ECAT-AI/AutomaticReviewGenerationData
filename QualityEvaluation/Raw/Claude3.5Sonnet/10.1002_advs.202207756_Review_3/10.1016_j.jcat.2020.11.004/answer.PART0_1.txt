[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[3] "When pyridine was introduced to the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15), the band corresponding to pyridine adsorbed on the LAS (1455 cm1) increases in intensity with increasing Ga/Al ratio."

[4] "The intensity of Ga hydride bands decreases with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of H-ZSM-5 at the same Ga/Al ratio (Fig. 5b and c), which could be, in part, attributed to lower the absolute Ga weight loadings."

[5] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."

[6] "Isolated and paired BAS are loosely defined as BAS without and with a neighboring BAS to interact with, respectively."

[7] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations for propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Ga speciation varies with Brønsted acid site (BAS) density in the zeolite, which is determined by the Si/Al ratio. Lower Si/Al ratios result in higher BAS densities and more paired BAS sites.

2. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species.

3. As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Ga+ species are introduced into the zeolite framework, leading to an increase in Lewis acid sites (LAS).

4. The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is favored at lower Si/Al ratios and higher Ga/Al ratios. This is because lower Si/Al ratios provide more paired BAS sites, which can form Ga+H+ pair sites capable of generating GaHx species.

5. Ga+H+ pair sites are proposed to be the species capable of forming GaHx, while isolated Ga+ species cannot form stable GaHx at high temperatures.

6. The intensity of Ga hydride bands decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio at the same Ga/Al ratio, partly due to lower absolute Ga weight loadings and fewer paired BAS sites.

7. The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites suggest they may have different catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure, particularly the distribution of paired and isolated BAS sites, plays a crucial role in determining the nature and concentration of active gallium species. This, in turn, likely influences the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度对Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质有显著影响。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. 镓的物种分布随沸石中Brønsted酸位点（BAS）密度的变化而变化，而BAS密度由Si/Al比决定。较低的Si/Al比导致更高的BAS密度和更多的成对BAS位点。

2. 成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立的BAS形成孤立的Ga+物种。

3. 随着Ga/Al比的增加，更多的Ga+物种被引入沸石骨架，导致Lewis酸位点（LAS）增加。

4. 镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成在较低的Si/Al比和较高的Ga/Al比下更有利。这是因为较低的Si/Al比提供了更多的成对BAS位点，可以形成能够生成GaHx物种的Ga+H+对位点。

5. Ga+H+对位点被认为是能够形成GaHx的物种，而孤立的Ga+物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx。

6. 在相同的Ga/Al比下，随着Si/Al比的增加，镓氢化物带的强度降低，部分原因是由于绝对镓含量降低和成对BAS位点减少。

7. Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+位点的不同性质表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化性能。

这些关系揭示了催化剂的结构，特别是成对和孤立BAS位点的分布，在决定活性镓物种的性质和浓度方面起着关键作用。这反过来可能影响催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。
