          [1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[3] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56"

[4] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C"

[5] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation"

[6] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

[7] "Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios, or higher Al contents, have higher densities of paired BAS assuming Al is distributed uniformly across the zeolite framework."

[8] "Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[9] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."

[10] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites"

          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Si/Al ratio: Lower Si/Al ratios (higher Al content) result in higher densities of paired Brønsted acid sites (BAS), which favor the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated BAS, resulting in isolated Ga+ species.

2. Ga/Al ratio: As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Ga+ species are introduced into the zeolite framework. The intensity of GaH2 increases linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when Ga/Al exceeds 0.1, and slowly declines above 0.56.

3. Framework aluminum pair density: Higher Al pair density (lower Si/Al ratio) promotes the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, which can form stable GaHx species. Lower Al pair density favors isolated Ga+ species, which do not form detectable GaHx species at high temperatures.

4. Nature of active species: Two distinct types of gallium species exist - Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species. Ga+H+ pair sites can form stable GaHx species, while isolated Ga+ species cannot.

5. Structure-activity correlations: The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species suggest they may have different catalytic activities in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The ability to form GaHx species, exclusive to Ga+H+ pair sites, may play a crucial role in the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

These relationships demonstrate that the catalyst's structure, determined by its composition, directly influences the nature of the active sites and, consequently, its activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Careful control of Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios can be used to optimize the distribution of active gallium species and potentially enhance catalyst performance.

          Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有显著影响，揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. Si/Al比例：较低的Si/Al比例（较高的Al含量）导致较高的成对Brønsted酸位点（BAS）密度，有利于形成Ga+H+对位点。较高的Si/Al比例导致更多的孤立BAS，形成孤立的Ga+物种。

2. Ga/Al比例：随着Ga/Al比例的增加，更多的Ga+物种被引入沸石骨架。GaH2的强度在低镓负载时线性增加，在Ga/Al超过0.1时趋于平稳，在0.56以上缓慢下降。

3. 骨架铝对密度：较高的Al对密度（较低的Si/Al比例）促进Ga+H+对位点的形成，这些位点可以形成稳定的GaHx物种。较低的Al对密度有利于形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不形成可检测的GaHx物种。

4. 活性物种的性质：存在两种不同类型的镓物种 - Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+物种。Ga+H+对位点可以形成稳定的GaHx物种，而孤立的Ga+物种不能。

5. 结构-活性相关性：Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+物种的不同性质表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。形成GaHx物种的能力（仅限于Ga+H+对位点）可能在催化剂的活性和选择性中起着关键作用。

这些关系表明，催化剂的结构（由其组成决定）直接影响活性位点的性质，从而影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性。通过仔细控制Si/Al和Ga/Al比例，可以优化活性镓物种的分布，潜在地提高催化剂性能。
