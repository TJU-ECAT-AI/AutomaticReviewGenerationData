[1] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[2] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[3] "The intensity of Ga hydride bands decreases with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of H-ZSM-5 at the same Ga/Al ratio (Fig. 5b and c), which could be, in part, attributed to lower the absolute Ga weight loadings."

[4] "No detectable spectral feature is observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with the Ga/Al ratio up to 1.3 (Ga wt% up to 3.68%)."

[5] "The combined results of our spectroscopic investigations could be largely rationalized by the formation of two distinct types of Ga species in zeolitic micropores through ion-exchange with BAS, i.e., Ga exchanged with isolated and paired BAS (Scheme 1)."

[6] "Ga+H+ pair sites, unlike isolated Ga+ sites, cannot react with water at 150 C, further confirming that these two Ga species possess distinct properties."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Ga/Al ratio: As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Ga+ species exchange with Brønsted acid sites (BAS). At low Ga/Al ratios, paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged, forming Ga+H+ pair sites. As the ratio increases, isolated BAS are also exchanged, forming isolated Ga+ species.

2. Si/Al ratio: Lower Si/Al ratios (higher Al content) lead to a higher density of paired BAS sites. This results in more Ga+H+ pair sites and stronger gallium hydride (GaHx) signals. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated BAS and consequently more isolated Ga+ species.

3. Framework aluminum pair density: Higher Al pair density (lower Si/Al ratio) promotes the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, which can form stable GaHx species. Lower Al pair density favors isolated Ga+ species, which do not form detectable GaHx species at high temperatures.

These relationships reveal that:

a) Two distinct types of active gallium species exist: Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species.
b) Ga+H+ pair sites can form stable GaHx species, while isolated Ga+ species cannot.
c) The distribution of these species depends on the zeolite's Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratio.
d) Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species have different reactivity, as demonstrated by their different behavior with water at 150°C.

These findings suggest that the catalyst's structure, determined by its composition, directly influences the nature of the active sites and, consequently, its activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The ability to control the distribution of these species through careful tuning of the Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios could lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有显著影响。这些关系揭示了在丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. Ga/Al比例：随着Ga/Al比例的增加，更多的Ga+物种与布朗斯特酸位点（BAS）交换。在低Ga/Al比例下，成对的BAS位点优先交换，形成Ga+H+对位点。随着比例的增加，孤立的BAS也被交换，形成孤立的Ga+物种。

2. Si/Al比例：较低的Si/Al比例（较高的Al含量）导致较高的成对BAS位点密度。这导致更多的Ga+H+对位点和更强的镓氢化物（GaHx）信号。较高的Si/Al比例导致更多的孤立BAS，因此形成更多的孤立Ga+物种。

3. 骨架铝对密度：较高的Al对密度（较低的Si/Al比例）促进Ga+H+对位点的形成，这些位点可以形成稳定的GaHx物种。较低的Al对密度有利于形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不形成可检测的GaHx物种。

这些关系揭示了：

a) 存在两种不同类型的活性镓物种：Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+物种。
b) Ga+H+对位点可以形成稳定的GaHx物种，而孤立的Ga+物种不能。
c) 这些物种的分布取决于沸石的Si/Al比例和Ga/Al比例。
d) Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+物种具有不同的反应性，这从它们在150°C下与水的不同行为中得到证实。

这些发现表明，催化剂的结构（由其组成决定）直接影响活性位点的性质，从而影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性。通过仔细调整Si/Al和Ga/Al比例来控制这些物种的分布，可能会导致更高效和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
