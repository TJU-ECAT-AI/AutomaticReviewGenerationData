[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[2] "Ga speciation of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is also found to depend on the Ga/Al ratio."

[3] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[4] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56"

[5] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C"

[6] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation"

[7] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Ga speciation varies with the density of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite, which is directly related to the Si/Al ratio.

2. Lower Si/Al ratios (higher Al content) result in a higher density of paired BAS sites, which preferentially exchange with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites.

3. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated BAS sites, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species upon exchange.

4. The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios:
   - GaHx species form more readily on zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios.
   - The intensity of GaHx bands increases linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off at moderate loadings, and then declines at higher Ga/Al ratios.
   - Isolated Ga+ sites (prevalent in high Si/Al ratio zeolites) do not form stable GaHx species.

5. Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species, while isolated Ga+ sites are not.

6. The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites suggest they may have different catalytic activities in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

These findings reveal that the distribution and nature of active gallium species in the catalyst are highly dependent on the zeolite framework composition and gallium loading. This understanding can be used to tailor catalyst properties for optimal performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions by controlling the Si/Al ratio and Ga loading to achieve the desired balance of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和镓改性沸石催化剂中的骨架铝对形成和活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的性质有显著影响。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. 镓的形态随沸石中布朗斯特酸位点（BAS）密度的变化而变化，而BAS密度与Si/Al比直接相关。

2. 较低的Si/Al比（较高的Al含量）导致成对BAS位点的密度更高，这些位点优先与Ga+交换形成Ga+H+对位点。

3. 较高的Si/Al比导致更多孤立的BAS位点，交换后形成孤立的Ga+物种。

4. 镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成同时依赖于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比：
   - GaHx物种在Si/Al比较低的沸石上更容易形成。
   - 在低镓负载时，GaHx带的强度线性增加，在中等负载时趋于平稳，然后在较高的Ga/Al比时下降。
   - 孤立的Ga+位点（在高Si/Al比沸石中普遍存在）不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。

5. Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种，而孤立的Ga+位点不能。

6. Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+位点的不同性质表明，它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。

这些发现表明，催化剂中活性镓物种的分布和性质高度依赖于沸石骨架组成和镓负载量。这一理解可用于通过控制Si/Al比和镓负载来调整催化剂性能，以在丙烷脱氢反应中实现最佳性能，达到Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+物种的理想平衡。
