[1] "As the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.7, several interesting trends emerge. The integrated area of the pyridinium band decreases by 75% as the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 0.7 (Fig. 3a(i-xii)), and then levels off at 80% at higher Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 3a(xiii-xv))."

[2] "The dependence of the GaHx formation on the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite (Fig. 5), i.e., the BAS density, suggests that the environment of BAS has an impact on the properties of the exchanged Ga species, as has also been concluded in recent reports [11,39,40]."

[3] "Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios, or higher Al contents, have higher densities of paired BAS assuming Al is distributed uniformly across the zeolite framework."

[4] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."

[5] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Brønsted acid sites (BAS) are replaced by gallium species, with up to 80% of BAS consumed at high Ga/Al ratios. This replacement process is more efficient at lower Ga/Al ratios, suggesting that easily accessible BAS are replaced first.

The Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, which determines the BAS density, plays a crucial role in the formation of different gallium species. Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios have higher densities of paired BAS, which favors the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species upon reduction.

In contrast, zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios have more isolated BAS, leading to the formation of isolated Ga+ species upon ion exchange. These isolated Ga+ species do not form stable GaHx species under the same conditions as Ga+H+ pair sites.

The framework aluminum pair density, which is related to the Si/Al ratio, affects the distribution of paired and isolated BAS. This, in turn, influences the type of gallium species formed during ion exchange and reduction.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure, particularly the distribution of paired and isolated BAS, directly impacts the nature of the active gallium species formed. The Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites exhibit different reactivity towards H2 and water, suggesting they may have different catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This structure-activity correlation highlights the importance of carefully controlling the zeolite composition and gallium loading to optimize catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质具有显著影响。这些关系揭示了在丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性。

随着Ga/Al比率的增加，更多的Brønsted酸位点（BAS）被镓物种取代，在高Ga/Al比率下可消耗高达80%的BAS。这种替换过程在较低的Ga/Al比率下更有效，表明容易接触到的BAS首先被替换。

沸石的Si/Al比率决定了BAS密度，在不同镓物种的形成中起着至关重要的作用。Si/Al比率较低的沸石具有较高的成对BAS密度，有利于形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点能够在还原条件下形成GaHx物种。

相比之下，Si/Al比率较高的沸石有更多的孤立BAS，导致离子交换后形成孤立的Ga+物种。这些孤立的Ga+物种在与Ga+H+对位点相同的条件下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。

骨架铝对密度与Si/Al比率相关，影响成对和孤立BAS的分布。这反过来又影响了在离子交换和还原过程中形成的镓物种类型。

这些关系揭示了催化剂的结构，特别是成对和孤立BAS的分布，直接影响形成的活性镓物种的性质。Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+位点对H2和水表现出不同的反应性，表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化性能。这种结构-活性相关性强调了在PDH反应中仔细控制沸石成分和镓负载以优化催化剂性能的重要性。
