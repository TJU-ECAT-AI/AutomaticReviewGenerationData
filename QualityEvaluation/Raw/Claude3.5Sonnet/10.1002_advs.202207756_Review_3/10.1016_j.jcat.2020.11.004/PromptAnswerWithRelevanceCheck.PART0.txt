[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[2] "Ga speciation of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is also found to depend on the Ga/Al ratio."

[3] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[4] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56"

[5] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C"

[6] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation"

[7] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Ga speciation varies with the density of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in the zeolite, which is directly related to the Si/Al ratio.

2. Lower Si/Al ratios (higher Al content) result in a higher density of paired BAS sites, which preferentially exchange with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites.

3. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated BAS sites, resulting in the formation of isolated Ga+ species upon exchange.

4. The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios:
   - GaHx species form more readily on zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios.
   - The intensity of GaHx bands increases linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off at moderate loadings, and then declines at higher Ga/Al ratios.
   - Isolated Ga+ sites (prevalent in high Si/Al ratio zeolites) do not form stable GaHx species.

5. Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species, while isolated Ga+ sites are not.

6. The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites suggest they may have different catalytic activities in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

These findings reveal that the distribution and nature of active gallium species in the catalyst are highly dependent on the zeolite framework composition and gallium loading. This understanding can be used to tailor catalyst properties for optimal performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions by controlling the Si/Al ratio and Ga loading to achieve the desired balance of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和镓改性沸石催化剂中的骨架铝对形成和活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的性质有显著影响。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. 镓的形态随沸石中布朗斯特酸位点（BAS）密度的变化而变化，而BAS密度与Si/Al比直接相关。

2. 较低的Si/Al比（较高的Al含量）导致成对BAS位点的密度更高，这些位点优先与Ga+交换形成Ga+H+对位点。

3. 较高的Si/Al比导致更多孤立的BAS位点，交换后形成孤立的Ga+物种。

4. 镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成同时依赖于Si/Al比和Ga/Al比：
   - GaHx物种在Si/Al比较低的沸石上更容易形成。
   - 在低镓负载时，GaHx带的强度线性增加，在中等负载时趋于平稳，然后在较高的Ga/Al比时下降。
   - 孤立的Ga+位点（在高Si/Al比沸石中普遍存在）不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。

5. Ga+H+对位点能够形成GaHx物种，而孤立的Ga+位点不能。

6. Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+位点的不同性质表明，它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。

这些发现表明，催化剂中活性镓物种的分布和性质高度依赖于沸石骨架组成和镓负载量。这一理解可用于通过控制Si/Al比和镓负载来调整催化剂性能，以在丙烷脱氢反应中实现最佳性能，达到Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+物种的理想平衡。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations for propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Ga speciation varies with Brønsted acid site (BAS) density in the zeolite, which is determined by the Si/Al ratio. Lower Si/Al ratios result in higher BAS densities and more paired BAS sites.

2. Paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+ to form Ga+H+ pair sites, while isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species.

3. As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Ga+ species are introduced into the zeolite framework, leading to an increase in Lewis acid sites (LAS).

4. The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is favored at lower Si/Al ratios and higher Ga/Al ratios. This is because lower Si/Al ratios provide more paired BAS sites, which can form Ga+H+ pair sites capable of generating GaHx species.

5. Ga+H+ pair sites are proposed to be the species capable of forming GaHx, while isolated Ga+ species cannot form stable GaHx at high temperatures.

6. The intensity of Ga hydride bands decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio at the same Ga/Al ratio, partly due to lower absolute Ga weight loadings and fewer paired BAS sites.

7. The different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites suggest they may have different catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure, particularly the distribution of paired and isolated BAS sites, plays a crucial role in determining the nature and concentration of active gallium species. This, in turn, likely influences the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度对Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质有显著影响。这些关系揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. 镓的物种分布随沸石中Brønsted酸位点（BAS）密度的变化而变化，而BAS密度由Si/Al比决定。较低的Si/Al比导致更高的BAS密度和更多的成对BAS位点。

2. 成对的BAS位点优先与Ga+交换形成Ga+H+对位点，而孤立的BAS形成孤立的Ga+物种。

3. 随着Ga/Al比的增加，更多的Ga+物种被引入沸石骨架，导致Lewis酸位点（LAS）增加。

4. 镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成在较低的Si/Al比和较高的Ga/Al比下更有利。这是因为较低的Si/Al比提供了更多的成对BAS位点，可以形成能够生成GaHx物种的Ga+H+对位点。

5. Ga+H+对位点被认为是能够形成GaHx的物种，而孤立的Ga+物种在高温下不能形成稳定的GaHx。

6. 在相同的Ga/Al比下，随着Si/Al比的增加，镓氢化物带的强度降低，部分原因是由于绝对镓含量降低和成对BAS位点减少。

7. Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+位点的不同性质表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化性能。

这些关系揭示了催化剂的结构，特别是成对和孤立BAS位点的分布，在决定活性镓物种的性质和浓度方面起着关键作用。这反过来可能影响催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Ga/Al ratio: As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Ga+ species exchange with Brønsted acid sites (BAS). At low Ga/Al ratios, paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged, forming Ga+H+ pair sites. As the ratio increases, isolated BAS are also exchanged, forming isolated Ga+ species.

2. Si/Al ratio: Lower Si/Al ratios (higher Al content) lead to a higher density of paired BAS sites. This results in more Ga+H+ pair sites and stronger gallium hydride (GaHx) signals. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated BAS and consequently more isolated Ga+ species.

3. Framework aluminum pair density: Higher Al pair density (lower Si/Al ratio) promotes the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, which can form stable GaHx species. Lower Al pair density favors isolated Ga+ species, which do not form detectable GaHx species at high temperatures.

These relationships reveal that:

a) Two distinct types of active gallium species exist: Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species.
b) Ga+H+ pair sites can form stable GaHx species, while isolated Ga+ species cannot.
c) The distribution of these species depends on the zeolite's Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratio.
d) Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species have different reactivity, as demonstrated by their different behavior with water at 150°C.

These findings suggest that the catalyst's structure, determined by its composition, directly influences the nature of the active sites and, consequently, its activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The ability to control the distribution of these species through careful tuning of the Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios could lead to more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有显著影响。这些关系揭示了在丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. Ga/Al比例：随着Ga/Al比例的增加，更多的Ga+物种与布朗斯特酸位点（BAS）交换。在低Ga/Al比例下，成对的BAS位点优先交换，形成Ga+H+对位点。随着比例的增加，孤立的BAS也被交换，形成孤立的Ga+物种。

2. Si/Al比例：较低的Si/Al比例（较高的Al含量）导致较高的成对BAS位点密度。这导致更多的Ga+H+对位点和更强的镓氢化物（GaHx）信号。较高的Si/Al比例导致更多的孤立BAS，因此形成更多的孤立Ga+物种。

3. 骨架铝对密度：较高的Al对密度（较低的Si/Al比例）促进Ga+H+对位点的形成，这些位点可以形成稳定的GaHx物种。较低的Al对密度有利于形成孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在高温下不形成可检测的GaHx物种。

这些关系揭示了：

a) 存在两种不同类型的活性镓物种：Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+物种。
b) Ga+H+对位点可以形成稳定的GaHx物种，而孤立的Ga+物种不能。
c) 这些物种的分布取决于沸石的Si/Al比例和Ga/Al比例。
d) Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+物种具有不同的反应性，这从它们在150°C下与水的不同行为中得到证实。

这些发现表明，催化剂的结构（由其组成决定）直接影响活性位点的性质，从而影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性。通过仔细调整Si/Al和Ga/Al比例来控制这些物种的分布，可能会导致更高效和选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。

[1] "As the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.7, several interesting trends emerge. The integrated area of the pyridinium band decreases by 75% as the Ga/Al ratio increases from 0 to 0.7 (Fig. 3a(i-xii)), and then levels off at 80% at higher Ga/Al ratios (Fig. 3a(xiii-xv))."

[2] "The dependence of the GaHx formation on the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite (Fig. 5), i.e., the BAS density, suggests that the environment of BAS has an impact on the properties of the exchanged Ga species, as has also been concluded in recent reports [11,39,40]."

[3] "Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios, or higher Al contents, have higher densities of paired BAS assuming Al is distributed uniformly across the zeolite framework."

[4] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation (Fig. 5a and b)."

[5] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides. These relationships reveal important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

As the Ga/Al ratio increases, more Brønsted acid sites (BAS) are replaced by gallium species, with up to 80% of BAS consumed at high Ga/Al ratios. This replacement process is more efficient at lower Ga/Al ratios, suggesting that easily accessible BAS are replaced first.

The Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, which determines the BAS density, plays a crucial role in the formation of different gallium species. Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios have higher densities of paired BAS, which favors the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites. These Ga+H+ pair sites are capable of forming GaHx species upon reduction.

In contrast, zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios have more isolated BAS, leading to the formation of isolated Ga+ species upon ion exchange. These isolated Ga+ species do not form stable GaHx species under the same conditions as Ga+H+ pair sites.

The framework aluminum pair density, which is related to the Si/Al ratio, affects the distribution of paired and isolated BAS. This, in turn, influences the type of gallium species formed during ion exchange and reduction.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure, particularly the distribution of paired and isolated BAS, directly impacts the nature of the active gallium species formed. The Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites exhibit different reactivity towards H2 and water, suggesting they may have different catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This structure-activity correlation highlights the importance of carefully controlling the zeolite composition and gallium loading to optimize catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质具有显著影响。这些关系揭示了在丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性。

随着Ga/Al比率的增加，更多的Brønsted酸位点（BAS）被镓物种取代，在高Ga/Al比率下可消耗高达80%的BAS。这种替换过程在较低的Ga/Al比率下更有效，表明容易接触到的BAS首先被替换。

沸石的Si/Al比率决定了BAS密度，在不同镓物种的形成中起着至关重要的作用。Si/Al比率较低的沸石具有较高的成对BAS密度，有利于形成Ga+H+对位点。这些Ga+H+对位点能够在还原条件下形成GaHx物种。

相比之下，Si/Al比率较高的沸石有更多的孤立BAS，导致离子交换后形成孤立的Ga+物种。这些孤立的Ga+物种在与Ga+H+对位点相同的条件下不能形成稳定的GaHx物种。

骨架铝对密度与Si/Al比率相关，影响成对和孤立BAS的分布。这反过来又影响了在离子交换和还原过程中形成的镓物种类型。

这些关系揭示了催化剂的结构，特别是成对和孤立BAS的分布，直接影响形成的活性镓物种的性质。Ga+H+对位点和孤立的Ga+位点对H2和水表现出不同的反应性，表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化性能。这种结构-活性相关性强调了在PDH反应中仔细控制沸石成分和镓负载以优化催化剂性能的重要性。

[1] "Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[2] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."

[3] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites"

[4] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56"

[5] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C"

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts:

1. At low Si/Al ratios (higher Al content), there is a higher probability of paired Brønsted acid sites (BAS). Ga+ preferentially exchanges with these paired sites to form Ga+H+ pair sites.

2. At high Si/Al ratios, isolated BAS are more common, leading to the formation of isolated Ga+ species upon exchange.

3. The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is only possible on Ga+H+ pair sites, not on isolated Ga+ sites. This is evident from the lack of GaHx spectral features on high Si/Al ratio samples (Si/Al = 39) even at high Ga loadings.

4. The intensity of GaHx species (particularly GaH2) increases linearly with Ga loading at low Ga/Al ratios, then levels off when Ga/Al exceeds 0.1, and slowly declines at Ga/Al ratios above 0.56.

5. The different behaviors of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites suggest they may have distinct catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions are likely influenced by the distribution of Ga species, which is in turn determined by the zeolite's Al distribution and Ga loading. The ability to form GaHx species, which is exclusive to Ga+H+ pair sites, may play a crucial role in the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度对Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质有显著影响：

1. 在低Si/Al比率（较高Al含量）下，成对的Brønsted酸位点（BAS）的概率较高。Ga+优先与这些成对位点交换，形成Ga+H+对位点。

2. 在高Si/Al比率下，孤立的BAS更常见，导致交换后形成孤立的Ga+物种。

3. 镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成仅在Ga+H+对位点上可能，而在孤立的Ga+位点上不可能。这从高Si/Al比率样品（Si/Al = 39）即使在高Ga负载下也没有GaHx光谱特征可以看出。

4. GaHx物种（特别是GaH2）的强度在低Ga/Al比率下随Ga负载线性增加，然后在Ga/Al超过0.1时趋于平缓，在Ga/Al比率高于0.56时缓慢下降。

5. Ga+H+对位点和孤立Ga+位点的不同行为表明它们在丙烷脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化性质。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性可能受到Ga物种分布的影响，而Ga物种分布又由沸石的Al分布和Ga负载量决定。形成GaHx物种的能力（仅限于Ga+H+对位点）可能在催化剂的活性和选择性中起着关键作用。
