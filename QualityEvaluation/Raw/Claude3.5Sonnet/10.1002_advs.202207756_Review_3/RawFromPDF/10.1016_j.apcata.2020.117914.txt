Abstract  
In heterogeneous catalysis, unravelling the distinct structural and compositional nature of active 
sites provides a good platform in modulating important catalytic properties toward improved 
activity and selectivity. Obviously, despite the direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) being a 
commercial process, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) remains a highly 
prospective technology for propene production due to its leveraged thermodynamic advantage 
and less susceptibility to catalyst deactivation. The present work has systematically and

comprehensively reviewed recent advances on key aspects related to ODHP catalysts such as 
nature of the active sites, active sites isolation, accessibility of active sites, active sites in layered-
double hydroxide (LDH) derived mixed oxide catalysts, intercalated LDH precursors, co-
precipitated LDH precursors, oxides-support interaction, oxygen vacancy, surface oxide 
reducibility, and acid–base property. Furthermore, discussion on accelerated discovery of novel 
catalysts via high-throughput experimentations (HTE) and high-throughput quantum 
computations (HTC) has been provided. Integrated frameworks via machine learning and Python 
language are hugely augmenting in this pursuit. It is hoped that this perspective provides insights 
on the design and tuning of heterogeneous catalysts, and in particular the development of 
efficient catalysts that could prompt industrialization and commercialization of ODHP process.

1.0   Introduction 
As major platform chemicals in the petrochemical industry, light olefins such as ethylene and 
propylene are extensively used in organic and polymer synthesis, and their annual global 
production are 160 and 110 mega tons respectively [1]. Figure 1 depicts the major chemical 
derivatives obtained from propylene [2]. They are currently produced industrially via steam or 
thermal cracking of naphtha, and fluid catalytic cracking of oil-based feedstocks. However, these 
processes are thermodynamically limited, energy intensive, generate coke heavily and demand 
complex separation of products [3]. As such, the search for alternative routes remained 
indispensable, especially with the high production of shale gas and natural gas, coupled with the 
fast depletion of light oil reserves globally. In addition, direct dehydrogenation of propane to 
propylene (PDH) is another commercial process, however, its high-energy consumption due to 
thermodynamic constraints [4] coupled with rapid catalyst deactivation [5] are the monumental 
impediments that necessitate the search for other alternative routes.

Figure 1. Major Propylene derivatives  
Among all the methods, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene appears 
highly prospective due to its thermodynamic leverage, and could proceed at lower temperature in 
the presence of an oxidant (limited oxygen) [2]. The thermodynamics of ODHP under different 
modes of operation has been discussed in a review by Rostom and De Lasa [6]. Basically, 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is facilitated on oxide and oxide-supported catalysts of 
transition metals, with lattice oxygen species as the major active sites. Figure 2 depicts a 
simplified ODHP reaction networks. The reduced catalysts require regeneration intermittently to 
sustain their catalytic performance with time-on-stream (TOS). Obviously, most studies in 
oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins (ODH) aimed to explore catalysts with 
efficient composition-activity and structure-activity functionality that will suppress the parallel 
and consecutive over-oxidation routes involved in the reaction mechanism (Figure 2). The 
essence is to improve the yield to olefin products and ensure long-term catalyst stability.  
Various transition metal oxides such as vanadium (VOx), Molybdenum (MoOx), and Chromium 
(CrOx) have been reported to have promising ODHP catalytic performance owing to their unique 
chemical coordination and tunable reducibility. They were reported either as mixed oxides or as

supported oxide catalysts.  The support materials include oxides (such as alumina, silica, titania, 
ceria, zirconia, and magnesium oxide), zeolites, and carbon-derived materials such as CNTs and 
rGO. Besides, metal oxide clusters supported on metal-organic framework have shown good 
prospect towards low-temperature ODHP performance [7-9]. Multi-metallic mixed oxide 
systems such as MoVTeNbO have been reported to have onset ODH activity at temperatures 
below 400oC [3]. The MoVTeNbO catalyst has promising ODH performance (nearly 60% ethane 
conversion and 90% ethylene selectivity) due to synergy among its constituent metal oxides. 
Additionally, boron-based catalysts such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) were serendipitously 
found to have incredible ODH performance for lower alkanes with lower COx selectivity [10].  
 
Most recently, Cao et al reported a novel strategy of synthesizing boron nitride catalyst with a 
3D spherical superstructure morphology [11]. The catalyst was derived from pyrolysis of metal-
organic framework (MOF) precursor, and it displayed a high propylene yield of 27.8% during 
ODHP. Another important class of ODHP catalysts are the metal-free carbon-based catalysts 
[12-15]. Their catalytic features can easily be tuned, and they also have promising low-
temperature ODHP performance. Besides, vanadium oxide open-framework nanostructured 
materials are a new class of highly potential ODHP catalysts [16]. They are composed of 3D 
arrays of {V18O42(XO4)} (X = V, S, etc) clusters which are well-interconnected by {–O–M–O–
}bridges (M = transition metals such as Co, Fe, Mn, etc) linkers. The catalytic behavior of these 
new class of catalysts for tailored application in ODH of propane could easily be achieved via 
tuning the heterometallic linkers. Noteworthy, despite the prospects of the various ODHP 
catalysts reported so far, there is still an urgent need to gain further insights with regards to the 
nature of their active sites. Proper understanding of the available active sites and their catalytic

roles can provide better alternatives in tuning the catalysts for improved ODHP performances 
towards industrial application.

In attempts to unmask the relationship between intrinsic properties of ODHP catalysts, several 
kinetic studies have been reported [17]. The ODHP kinetics involves a complex scheme, with the 
consecutive and parallel over-oxidation of the propane and propylene respectively, leading to the 
undesired COx products [18]. Carrero et al have carefully reviewed the ODHP kinetics of well-
defined supported vanadium-based catalysts [2]. Obviously, the nature of active species available 
on  catalyst surface plays significant roles in determining the selectivity, mechanism and kinetics 
of the catalyst [19]. High-throughput experimental runs at various operating conditions 
essentially contribute to development of robust kinetic models [2]. Kinetic studies are very 
important, because they provide insights for improving the designs and optimization of catalysts 
for particular application. Notably, for most exothermic processes such as ODHP, the choice of 
appropriate reactor type and configuration is paramount in the development of the process to 
commercial scale. Even though fixed bed reactors are simpler and require less complex control 
setup over fluidized beds, the latter offer superior advantages. These include efficient mass 
transport, less prone to hotspot formation coupled with ease of catalyst regeneration [20]. 
Journal Pre-proof

However, not all catalysts are fluidizable, and this posed an extra challenge in the design and 
synthesis of catalysts used in the fluidized bed [21]. Rostom and De Lasa [6] have discussed 
reactor concept and effect of operating conditions in their recent review. The investigation of 
kinetics in heterogeneous reactions stand to furnish information not only on the property-activity 
functions of the catalysts involved, but also the interplay between the homogeneous gas phase 
and surface heterogeneous reactions involved in the ODHP mechanism. It should be noted that 
for the ODHP process to become industrially viable, novel designs in reactor concepts are 
important. 
Interestingly, there are some excellent reviews on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light 
alkanes (including propane) to olefins [22-24] with CO2  [25,26], on vanadium-based catalysts 
[27], carbon-based catalysts [28,29], on boron nitride catalyst [30], or specifically on ODHP [6] 
and its kinetics [2],  and on CO2-assited ODHP [31]. In recent times, large amount of literature 
providing further insight into the structural nature of active sites along with key catalytic 
properties linked to ODHP catalysts has been reported. These properties include oxide-support 
interaction, oxygen vacancy, acid–base property, and surface oxide reducibility. Other aspects 
include nature of active sites on ODHP catalysts, active sites isolation, accessibility of active 
sites, active sites in layered-double hydroxide (LDH) derived mixed oxide catalysts, intercalated 
LDH precursors, and co-precipitated LDH precursors. Thus, the present review is a discussion on 
these advances, aimed to provide perspectives on rational design and tuning of catalysts for 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP). Obviously, the strategies here 
discussed are not only applicable to ODHP reaction, especially that literatures rationalizing the 
concepts of these properties are scarce, and the properties have substantial influence on catalytic 
activity, selectivity, and stability of many heterogeneous catalysts. Furthermore, highlights on

the importance of accelerated catalyst discovery via high-throughput experimentations (HTE) 
and high-throughput quantum computations (HTC) has been provided. 
1.1 Modes of operation of ODHP 
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) can be facilitated in various modes. Operating 
ODHP under limited oxygen atmosphere has the advantage that deposited coke can easily be 
burned off and the site regenerated easily. However, chances of deep oxidation of the propane 
and other olefin products (ethylene and propylene) increases, which is detrimental to the overall 
ODHP selectivity. Another alternative is the use of mild oxidants such as N2O [32] and CO2 [33] 
to limit the direct and consecutive total oxidation reactions depicted on Figure 2. While N2O is 
promising in generating selective nucleophilic oxygens when re-oxidizing reduced catalysts [34], 
its cost will likely be an impending factor for its utilization on industrial scale [35]. The use of 
CO2 has dual advantage of improving ODHP selectivity and as an alternative CO2 valorization 
means. Nonetheless, its inertness presents a challenge in developing ODHP catalysts that are 
strong enough to activate the CO2 effectively and also catalyze the C-H activation selectively. 
Notably, ODHP can also be operated under oxygen-free atmosphere [36], where it is facilitated 
mainly on lattice oxygen species available on surface of catalysts. Obviously, with long time-on-
stream or more catalytic cycles, the amount of the lattice oxygen will get depleted, and the 
reduced catalyst will require regeneration in hot air to burn the coke and replenish the sites. 
Despite the fact that this mode of ODHP operation is highly prospective in limiting the parallel 
propane combustion and consecutive propylene oxidation routes, the grand challenge remains the 
design and development of catalyst with highly active and selective lattice oxygens. Electrophilic 
oxygens are known to be highly reactive but less selective, while more nucleophilic oxygens are 
very selective but less active [22]. Thus, modulating the catalytic feature of the lattice and

adsorbed oxygens to improve both their activity and selectivity is an important option for 
developing efficient ODHP catalysts.  
 
2.0   Active sites 
This section entails discussion regarding the nature active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation of 
propane (ODHP), probing of the active sites and site isolation, active sites accessibility, active 
sites in layered-double hydroxide (LDH) derived mixed oxide catalysts, switching of active 
centers during ODHP process, and structural requirements in terms of active components for 
ODHP reaction. Obviously, adequate understanding of the active sites involved in any 
heterogeneous reaction can provide good insight to rational design of novel catalysts with 
improved stable catalytic performance, possibly at lower temperature below the conventional. 
  
2.1    Active site in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
In catalysis, active component, promoter, and support are the basic components that usually 
constitute a catalyst for particular application [37]. The active sites are the main catalytic centers 
assembled within the active component, where electronic interactions happen with adsorbates 
during reactions. There are different classes of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of 
propane (ODHP). They include metal oxide-based catalysts (supported or unsupported), carbon-
based catalysts, supported metal catalysts, and boron-containing catalysts such as hexagonal 
boron nitride. The active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are different for 
different class of catalysts. These active sites are widely considered to be reactive oxygen species 
present in different structural forms on the surfaces of the catalysts.  
 
Journal Pre-proof
10 
 
As it will be discussed shortly under tuning strategy section, heteroatom doping, thermal and 
chemical treatment of the bulk catalysts, and use of suitable support materials can result in 
significant modification on the reactivity and selectivity of the active oxygen species. Basically, 
the changes in the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of active sites stem from changes in 
electronic and geometric effects within the catalysts that ensue from the appropriate catalyst 
tuning strategy [38]. These effects are nanoscale phenomena that greatly impact on active sites, 
and translate to significant influence on the overall catalytic performances of the catalysts. 
Moreover, lattice strain effect and proximity to surface defect such as oxygen vacancy can 
influence the catalytic nature of active sites [39]. Direct probing of these effects or examining 
their contributions separately on catalytic activity requires systematic study and use of advanced 
analytical techniques, especially in operando or in situ mode [40].  
 
Currently, metal oxide-based catalysts are the most explored in oxidative dehydrogenation of 
propane (ODHP), and their active sites are majorly the lattice oxygen species. The active sites 
mostly facilitate the ODHP reaction via Mars-Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, involving 
sequences of oxidation-reduction steps on the metal oxide surface. The difference in the 
chemical environment [41] and location [42] of lattice oxygen species can give rise to significant 
variation in their catalytic properties. Among the various oxygen species that could be available 
on the surface of metal oxide catalysts include those adsorbed as molecules (𝑂2), neutral atoms 
(O), superoxide (𝑂2
−), peroxide (𝑂2
2−), ozonide (𝑂3
−) or oxygen radical (𝑂−) [43]. The more 
electron-deficient the species are (more electrophilic), the more reactive and less selective they 
are likely to be in oxidative reactions with light hydrocarbons (ethane and propane). The 
electrophilic character follows the trend; 𝑂− > 𝑂3
−  > 𝑂2
2− >𝑂2
−. Figure 3 shows a scheme 
representing nucleophilic and electrophilic oxygen species available on metal oxide-based

catalysts. In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), lattice oxygen (O2-) species with 
appropriate nucleophilic character are known to be highly selective towards propylene product 
[22]. The nucleophilic property is majorly determined by the ability of the oxygen species to 
donate electrons and the strength of the metal-oxygen (M-O) bond involved at the active sites. 
Noteworthy, probing the catalytic contributions of the various adsorbed oxygens and the lattice 
oxygen species available on the surfaces of ODHP catalysts is very important. This can provide 
useful insights for optimizing the composition-activity functions of the catalysts, and could be 
achieved through well-designed experiments.

In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the reaction begins with activation of propane 
molecule by the surface reactive oxygen species that serve as the active sites. Depending on the 
nature of the catalyst and the available active sites, the activation of the C-H bond in the propane 
molecule may proceed via single-electron or paired-electron transfer process. The activation of 
the C-H bond in propane molecules via single-electron mechanism is a homolytic bond cleavage 
that generates propyl radicals [44,45], while the paired-electron mechanism involves a 
Journal Pre-proof
12 
 
heterolytic cleavage [46]. However, most of the catalysts reported for ODHP (especially metal 
oxide-based) facilitate the C-H activation by nucleophilic oxygen species (strong basic centers) 
via the paired-electron mechanism (equation 1). After the C-H activation, a reduced site is 
formed and should be regenerated for the next catalytic cycle. Equations 2-4 depict the activation 
of gas phase oxygen to regenerate the nucleophilic lattice oxygen species at the reduced site. The 
oxygen reduction process requires four electrons per mole of oxygen [42]. In a DFT study on 
terminated Ti2C MXenes, the C-H activation in propane was found to strongly correlate with 
hydrogen affinity [47]. It should be noted that the present review is not intended to cover detailed 
discussion on the C-H activation mechanisms of the various catalysts involved in ODHP. Figure 
4 depicts the steps involved in ODHP on nucleophilic lattice oxygen species available on 
MnWO4 catalyst surface. The first C-H activation is usually the rate-determining step [48,49]. 
Subsequently, depending on the nature of interaction between the sites and the intermediates 
generated, propylene or other undesired products such as COx are produced. The selectivity of a 
catalyst in ODHP depends on the ability of its active sites to catalytically stabilize the 
intermediates, and steer the reaction towards the desired product.

The regeneration of the reduced active sites is an essential step in the catalytic cycle, and it has 
strong impact on the activity and selectivity of the ODHP process. The re-oxidation of the 
reduced site begins with the adsorption of the oxidant (𝑂2, 𝑁2𝑂, 𝐶𝑂2) from the gas phase, 
followed by its activation on the site (equations 2-4). The nature of the oxidizing atmosphere 
used during re-oxidation of the reduced catalysts plays an important role in the nature of the 
surface oxygen species that ensue on the recovered sites. A systematic study on VOx/MCM-41 
Journal Pre-proof
14 
 
catalyst with Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy revealed that less selective 
and highly reactive electrophilic anionic oxygen radicals are generated when re-oxidation is done 
under gas phase oxygen [51]. Under the N2O gas, such oxygen species that completely burn 
propylene molecules were not observed. Rather, diamagnetic nucleophilic species O2- are the 
ones most probably formed.  
 
Besides, in boron-containing catalysts, trigonal boron borosilicate zeolite[52], defective sites on 
h-BN [53], oxygen-terminated armchair (>B-O-ON<) on h-BN [54], tri-coordinated boroxol and 
hydroxylated linear boron species on B2O3/SBA-15 [55], and edge-located hydroxyl group on 
BNOH [56] were reported as the active centers responsible for the observed propylene selectivity 
during ODHP. For carbon-based catalysts, oxygen-containing functional groups are majorly the 
active sites involved in oxidative dehydrogenation roles [29,57]. The oxygen groups could be 
located at armchair (Figure 5a) or zigzag (Figure 5b) terminations, and could be modified 
significantly via treatment in oxidizing environments or treatment with acids and other chemicals 
such as phosphates. Regardless of the catalyst class, whether metal oxide-based or metal-free 
such as carbocatalysts, nucleophilic oxygen groups are more selective but less reactive compared 
to their electrophilic counterparts. Among the various oxygen groups, quinone and diketone 
located at armchair and zigzag edges are most nucleophilic (Figure 5c) [58]. Presence of defects 
on carbon-based catalysts such as CNT can be beneficial to formation of ketonic carbonyl groups 
through oxo-functionalization, and the sites formed are highly selective in ODHP [59]. Liu et al 
reported that the amount of carbonyl–quinone in hydrothermally-derived ordered mesoporous 
carbon catalysts strongly correlated with the ODHP reaction rate [60]. Sun et al investigated the 
effect of boron doping on nanodiamond for ODHP [61]. They revealed that at moderate borate 
Journal Pre-proof
15 
 
doping, the formation of electrophilic oxygen sites (which favor COx products) was suppressed 
significantly. This was achieved when the dopant preferentially interacted with the available 
surface defects of the nanodiamond catalyst. However, the surface carbonyl groups became 
blocked at higher dopant concentration, and tetrahedrally coordinated boron ensued, leading to 
loss in propylene selectivity. Most recently, edge-located modified carbonyl groups on graphitic 
carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are found to be the active sites involved in ODH of propane, as 
evidenced by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) [62].

and c) their nucleophilicity derived via DFT calculation [58]. 
 
It is noteworthy that the review articles by Schlögl [63] and Védrine [64] are informative in 
further understanding of the nature and behaviour of active sites of mixed oxide catalysts for 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Obviously, the presence of defects and several 
other kinds of oxygen species such as chemisorbed (O2-) and dissociatively adsorbed (O-) species 
may ensue on catalytic surfaces during activation of fresh catalysts or re-oxidation of reduced 
ones. This has greatly contributed to the difficulty in understanding the unique nature of active 
Journal Pre-proof
16 
 
sites for most of the ODHP catalyst reported. Beside, a clear difference in the C-H bond 
activation for ODHP and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is that they proceed via 
heterolytic and homolytic bond cleavage, respectively [65], and the later occurs on reduced 
catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated cations as active sites [66-68]. This suggests that a 
catalyst may be investigated for both ODHP and PDH activities, depending on the mode of the 
catalytic testing [69]. The intrinsic performance of active sites can be represented more 
accurately in terms of turnover frequency (TOF) instead of the conventional approach of using 
percentage conversion. The TOF indicates the catalytic activity of a catalyst per active site, and it 
is so far the best way to compare performances of various catalysts in a particular reaction. 
 
2.2    Understanding the nature of active sites and site isolation 
The structural and compositional complexity of most heterogeneous catalysts demands robust 
systematic approaches to reveal the distinct nature of their active sites. These approaches may 
involve corroborating the trends in catalytic performance with surface analysis and spectroscopic 
techniques along with DFT modelling [70]. Understanding the true nature of active sites under 
real experimental conditions provides the necessary platform to establish reaction mechanisms 
and enable knowledge-driven design of novel catalysts with optimized catalytic features. 
Besides, the geometric and electronic state of catalysts under real reaction conditions are most 
likely different from those of as-prepared catalysts. As such, probing the active sites to unveil 
their chemical state and structure via operando characterizations remains indispensable [71]. 
This will facilitate establishment of composition-performance and structure-performance 
relationships that better reflect the dynamic interactions of reaction intermediates with the 
catalytic surfaces.  
Journal Pre-proof
17 
 
 
Obviously, vanadium-based catalysts are the most explored among metal oxide ODHP catalysts. 
Due to the structural complexity of their active phase [72], clear understanding of their structure-
performance relationship requires synthesis techniques capable of yielding well-defined isolated 
VOx species. Barman et.al reported a synthesis method for silica-supported vanadia catalyst with 
well-defined surface species via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) [73]. The SOMC 
protocol offered high degree of control in the grafting and isolation of the monomeric VOx 
species on the silica surface. The authors employed μ2-oxo-bridged, bimetallic [V2O4(acac)2] 
complex as the vanadia precursor and tuned its interactions with the surface of the silica support 
via controlled thermal dehydroxylation of the support prior to the grafting process. The single-
site VOx catalyst showed superior ODHP performance (nearly twofold propylene formation at 
525 oC) compared to similar vanadium-based catalysts synthesized via incipient wetness 
impregnation (IWI). The IWI method resulted in mixtures of monomeric and polymeric VOx 
species on the support, and even crystalline phase at higher V loading. Advances in 
complementary operando characterizations such as simultaneous Transmission FTIR and Raman 
Characterization (IRRaman) can offer great capability in probing adsorbed species, reaction 
intermediates, and structural properties of VOx catalysts under real ODHP conditions [74]. 
Obvious, this can aid in revealing the actual identity of the active centers that participate in every 
stage of the oxidative dehydrogenation process. 
Additionally, Samantaray et. al have discussed prospect of surface organometallic chemistry 
(SOMC) in relation to single atom catalysis (SAC), and how the overlap between the two could 
set a new direction in the rational design of ODHP catalysts with well-defined surface active 
phase [75]. The SOMC involves regulating the concentration of supported active sites by tuning 
Journal Pre-proof
18 
 
of the amount of the surface OH groups [76]. The oxide support is dehydroxylated prior to 
grafting of the active phase precursor. Controlled thermal treatment of the grafted metal complex 
yields the well-defined isolated supported sites (Figure 6), and removes the remnant of the 
organometallic precursor [76]. The difference in the reactivity of the organometallic precursors 
and the various support materials can result in surface sites that are structurally distinct [77]. The 
advantage in active-site isolation offered by the SOMC will aid in better understanding of the 
structure-activity relationships in ODHP catalysts, especially metal oxide-based. In addition to 
the usefulness of site isolation in understanding the identity of active sites, it can also improve 
the selectivity and stability of the active sites. Beside the use of SOMC, site isolation could be 
achieved by other strategies such as surface treatment. Typically, surface treatment of 
VOx/Al2O3 with phosphine via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was reported to have 
significantly improved the catalytic stability of the catalyst (during direct dehydrogenation of 
propane) due to isolation of the V2O5 phase and inhibition of coke precursor oligomerization 
[78].  
Obviously, the presence of more isolated sites is beneficial to the overall ODHP performance, 
and can ease the desorption of the propylene products prior to being further oxidized. And that 
depends on the nature of the support, and the interaction of the active phase with the support 
during the catalyst synthesis. VOx catalyst supported on Ce-doped titania nanotube (Ce/TiO2 
molar ratio of 0.05) displayed superior thermal stability and better propylene selectivity due to 
higher amount of isolated VOx phase [79]. However, in VOx/nano-ZSM-5 catalysts, the effect of 
more acid sites due to the acidic nature of the support more than compensated the effect of 
increase in proportion of isolated VOx species. This led to detrimental effect on the propylene 
selectivity and caused more COx products especially at higher temperatures due to higher 
Journal Pre-proof
19 
 
cracking selectivity [80]. Thus, site isolation and acidity of support materials are important 
factors to be considered in the design and development of more efficient ODHP catalysts that 
could produce less COx products. The COx products are usually generated due to overoxidation 
reactions of reactant propane or the reaction intermediates. Most importantly, the potentials of 
organometallic chemistry (SOMC) in generating isolated active species which can aid in probing 
identity of active sites and their ODHP catalytic contributions should be explored in other 
supported oxides other than vanadium-based catalysts.

Chemistry (SOMC) [76] 
 
2.3    Active sites accessibility 
The accessibility to active sites is another crucial factor in ensuring improved catalytic 
performance in heterogeneous catalysis. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is not 
an exception.  As will be discussed later, use of suitable supports can significantly improve the 
dispersion of the active phase of ODHP catalysts. Structured supports such as monolith, MCM, 
SBA-15 are known to offer excellent stabilization of active sites as well as improved transport 
properties. VOx incorporated in mesoporous silica KIT-6 (V-KIT-6) resulted in high dispersion 
and accessibility of active sites due to its interconnected 3D pore architecture [81,82]. The 
Journal Pre-proof
20 
 
catalyst displayed improved ODHP performance (Table 1). Modification of the catalyst with 
potassium, especially at lower V-loading is beneficial to formation of isolated VOx species, 
however, it is accompanied by significant decline in the pore diameter of the resultant catalysts 
(Table 1) [82]. It is noteworthy that the ability to stabilize active sites on a support alone does not 
guarantees improvement in catalytic performance, the accessibility to these sites is another 
important factor. Thus, catalysts investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane should 
be examined for the accessibility of their active sites. For metal-free catalysts such as 
carbocatalysts, modulation of their microstructure provides an effective approach in tuning their 
active sites accessibility [29].

c3DOM implies three-dimensionally ordered macroporous 
 
Notably, active site accessibility can also be achieved via designing the active phase as three-
dimensionally (3D) ordered materials with well-interconnected macropores. Fang et al reported 
significant improvement in propylene selectivity over three-dimensionally ordered macroporous 
catalysts with varying NiCe molar ratios (3DOMxNiCe, x=molar ratio of Ni/Ce) [83] as depicted 
on Table 1. The authors attributed the observed selectivity improvement to be partly due to 
improved mass transport of both the reactant (propane molecules) and the propylene in the 
3DOMxNiCe catalysts by virtue of their interconnected micro- or mesoporous frameworks. Such 
improved mass transport could inhibits the consecutive propene oxidation [84]. Most recently, 
Lu et al reported a metal-free boron phosphate catalyst with a stable 3D ordered macroporous 
structure via in situ nanocasting involving hydrothermal treatment [85]. The ordered spherical 
polymeric templates were removed after calcination (Figure 7a), and the BPO4 phase with 3D 
framework ensued. The authors revealed that the BPO4(OM) catalyst exhibited improved mass 
transport compared to a benchmarked nonporous BPO4(bulk) sample. In addition, tri-coordinated 
B–O species available on the surface were suggested to be the main active sites, and the 
BPO4(OM) catalyst showed improved ODHP performance (~14% conv., 82% propylene select.) 
compared to the BPO4(bulk), as depicted in Figure 7b. Obviously, the use of templating strategy 
to design the active phase of catalysts into 3D stable frameworks provides an opportunity in 
improving accessibility of active sites without necessarily using any support material.

2.4    Active sites in LDH-derived mixed oxide catalysts 
Most recently, insertion of active species into the interlayer space of layered structured materials 
such as graphite, MXenes, porphyrin, layered-double hydroxide or other tailored layered 
supports in form of nanosheets has received keen attention in diverse areas of research. In 
catalysis, due to the tunable surface chemistry of the hosts, such intercalation may result in 
Journal Pre-proof
23 
 
significant modulation of the active sites or creation of new sites with improved catalytic 
functions [86]. Intercalation can greatly enhance the electronic and structural properties of the 
active sites, improve their thermal stability and enable facile product desorption [87]. Mixed 
oxide as heterogeneous catalysts have been widely applied in facilitating diverse industrial 
catalytic processes. In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) studies, layered-double 
hydroxides (LDHs) are among the widely reported precursors for the synthesis of mixed oxide 
catalysts. The LDHs are two-dimensional anionic materials, with versatile composition and 
highly tunable layered structure [88]. The positively charged sheets of LDHs are compensated by 
interlayer-located anions such as carbonate, chloride or hydroxyl to maintain electrical neutrality. 
The positively charged layers are usually composed of divalent and trivalent cations. Notably, 
mixed oxide catalysts from the LDH precursors can either be derived by incorporation of the 
active metal species (such as transition or rare-earth metal) in or outside the brucite-like sheets, 
or via intercalation in the interlayer space. In either case, the mixed oxide catalysts ensue after 
subsequent thermal treatment of the loaded LDH precursors. 
2.4.1 Intercalated LDH precursors 
Synthesis of mixed oxide catalysts from intercalated LDH precursors usually involves 
synthesizing the LDH precursors first, followed by intercalation of the active metal species via 
ion exchange. The anionic active metal species either as oxometalates or polyoxometalates are 
ion exchanged at regulated pH in a solution with the charge-compensation anions localized in the 
interlayer of the LDHs [88]. The constituents of the active species could have more than a single 
metal, so also the cations that form the positively charged layers of the LDH could be composed 
of more than two metals [89]. It should be noted that not always the intended intercalation results 
in confinement of the active species in the interlamellar space of the LDH host. Several factors 
Journal Pre-proof
24 
 
such as use and nature of anionic chelating agents, nature of the compensation anion, synthesis 
methodology can influence whether the active metal species localize outside the sheets, within 
them or inside the anionic interlayer space [88]. The site localization of the active metal species 
may have profound influence on the coking resistance, thermal stability as well as the overall 
catalytic behaviour of the LDH-derived mixed oxide catalyst [90]. 
 
Valverde et al reported a mixed oxide catalysts derived from decavanadate-intercalated LDH 
precursors for ODHP [91]. The LDHs were carbonate and hydroxyl anion-compensated Ni–Al 
hydrotalcites obtained from hydrothermal method. Interestingly, the nature of the compensation 
anions greatly influenced the properties of the final catalysts. In the case of the hydroxyl-
compensated (NiAlHV_Cal) catalyst, beside the NiO crystalline phase, additional pyrovanadate 
and nickel orthovanadate phases were observed due to the vanadium being incorporated outside 
the interlayer space of the LDH precursor. Overall, the Ni-V-Al samples had lower maximum 
reduction temperature (below 600 oC) from H2-TPR, and were more selective to propylene under 
excess oxygen condition. The authors also found that high Ni/V ratio (5.4) prompted preferential 
crystallization of Ni3V2O8 that could play synergistic roles with NiO phase in ODHP.  
 
Obviously, derivation of mixed oxide catalysts from synthesis involving intercalated LDH 
precursors is a promising alternative. Alvarez et al revealed that ZnAlVO mixed oxides obtained 
from decavanadate-intercalated LDH had nearly ten-fold ODHP activity compared to ones 
obtained from impregnation method [92]. Moreover, increase in the calcination temperature was 
found to be beneficial to the catalytic performance of the LDH-derived catalysts. The authors 
found that the strength of the Lewis and Brønsted acid sites was more decisive in explaining the 
Journal Pre-proof
25 
 
catalytic behaviour of the LDH-derived catalysts compared to other factors like reducibility and 
nature of the crystalline phases. For several investigated LDH-derived mixed oxide catalysts, 
there was no observable correlation between their observed ODHP catalytic performance with 
H2-TPR reducibility [93]. In an LDH-derived Mg-V-Al mixed oxide, high acidity and low 
basicity impede desorption of propylene molecules that subsequently oxidized to CO products 
[94]. Blanco et al made same finding on impregnation-derived Mg-V-Al mixed oxide [95]. The 
authors also found that Mg-V oxide (having medium acid strength) obtained via impregnation 
method deactivated rapidly, and combustion of the propylene molecules on electrophilic sites 
produced majorly CO2. Table 2 shows the catalytic performances of layered-double hydroxide 
(LDH) derived catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). 
 
2.4.2 Co-precipitated LDH precursors 
Apart from use of intercalated LDH precursors, synthesis of mixed oxide catalysts for oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane were reported via co-precipitation LDH precursors. In this case, the 
metal active species are located mostly within the brucite-like sheets. They are co-precipitated 
during synthesis with the other metals that later form the positively charged layers of the 
hydrotalcites. The drive for this easier approach is most probably the quest to achieve 
homogeneous distribution of the active component in the final catalyst [96]. The high dispersion 
of the derivative co-precipitated LDH precursor catalyst is expected to make the active sites 
more isolated for better propylene selectivity. The catalytic properties and behaviors of the 
mixed oxide catalysts derived via this approach could be tuned easily by systematic varying of 
the constituent oxides [97] and their proportion, modifying the calcination temperature and

26 
 
calcination atmosphere, regulating the pH of the precipitating solution, and intercalation of 
various inorganic anions in the interlayer spaces.

Typically, in Ni-Al mixed oxides derived via co-precipitation of LDH precursors, increase in Ni 
content prompted more interaction among the component oxides [100]. Consequently, the 
selectivity in ODH of ethane improved, whereas both the activity and selectivity of propane 
ODH were negatively impacted.  Most recently, Gao et al reported a study on three synthesized 
Ni-Al mixed oxides derived from LDH precursors and benchmarked their ODHP performance 
with a nano NiO, all thermally pre-treated at 600 oC [98]. They utilized constant pH co-
precipitation, variable pH co-precipitation, and urea hydrolysis method to synthesize the 
4NiAl(C)-600, 4NiAl(V)-600 and 4NiAl(U)-600, respectively. At 450 oC, the 4NiAl(V)-600 
sample showed highest activity (27% C3H8 conversion), and the yield to propylene for all the 
catalysts were comparable (~ 11%) (Table 2). However, both 4NiAl(V)-600 and NiO gave 
purely cracking product (CH4) and COx at 500 oC, despite having C3H8 conversion of 100% and 
32%, respectively. The 4NiAl(U)-600 displayed a conversion of ~ 40% and a propylene yield of 
~11% at 500 oC, projecting the urea hydrolysis method as a more promising technique in 
synthesizing the Ni-Al mixed oxides for ODHP application. Obviously, synthesis of mixed oxide 
catalysts via co-precipitation of LDH precursors without necessarily involving the additional ion 
exchange step provides more alternatives in modulating the catalysts.   
 
In addition, Huang et. al reported the intercalation of different anionic species (carbonates, 
sulfates, and phosphates) into layered-double hydroxide (LDH) structure to synthesize various 
anion-pillared LDH-derived Co-Al LDO (layered-double oxide) catalysts for ODHP application 
[99]. The synthesis resulted in the active cobalt species being homogeneously dispersed in the 
LDH sheets. They exploited the advantage offered by the layered-structure of the LDH materials 
to incorporate the highly active Co species. Consequently, the property-activity function of the 
Journal Pre-proof
29 
 
Co-based mixed oxide catalysts (Co-Al LDO) that ensued after calcination became modulated. 
The authors utilized hydrothermal method followed by an anion exchange with different 
inorganic anions (carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates). The phosphate pillared catalysts (CA-P 
LDO) displayed more improved performance (~26% conv., ~39% propylene select. at 400 oC) 
compared to a benchmarked CoAl mixed oxide catalyst derived via LDH Co-precipitaion 
without anionic exchange (Table 2). They attributed the propylene selectivity improvement to 
decrease in oxygen reactivity, partly caused by alumina enrichment and anion presence at the 
surface. Interestingly, results of the catalytic performances among the different anion-pillared 
catalysts suggested possible differences in their C-H activation mechanisms.  
 
Obviously, well-dispersed cobalt-based mixed oxide derived from co-precipitation of LDH 
precursors constitute a promising class of ODHP catalysts, especially when the active species 
exist in tetrahedral coordination [101]. The spinel Co3O4 structure is more selective to COx 
products, especially at higher cobalt-loading. Most recently, Dai et.al revealed intercalation of 
cobalt in γ-Al2O3 sheets and achieved well-dispersed stabilized tetrahedral Co2+ species in the 
Co-Al2O3-HT. The catalyst showed remarkable performance in direct propane dehydrogenation 
(PDH) (~22% conv., 97% propylene select.) compared to a benchmarked Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst 
derived via impregnation method [102]. Besides, the catalyst was highly stable with no 
observable coke formation. Evidently, the design of catalysts via exploitation of tunable 
structures such as layered-double hydroxide (LDH) and other tailor-made nanosheet materials is 
a promising approach in designing efficient catalysts for ODHP application.

2.5    Structural nature of active components 
In recent times, vast amount of literature revealing the structural nature of active site involved in 
different catalytic systems for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been reported. 
Typically, Zhang et.al examined the influence of phase composition of Mg-V-O oxides on 
intrinsic ODHP performance [103]. The catalysts were synthesized via a citrate method with 
NH4VO3 and Mg (NO3)2·6H2O as precursors. The synthesis method had great impact on the 
nature of phase composition of the active oxides that ensued [104].The authors revealed that 
ODHP turnover rates of the phases followed the trend MgV2O6 >α-Mg2V2O7 > Mg3V2O8, 
corroborating the same trend in the surface reducibility. Notable, they found the absence of 
synergistic effects in the ODHP performance of formulated biphasic Mg-V-O physical mixtures 
(MgV2O6 + α-Mg2V2O7, MgV2O6 + Mg3V2O8, and α-Mg2V2O7 + Mg3V2O8). Interestingly, the α-
Mg2V2O7 basically contained crystalline V2O7 dimeric units, and it displayed superior intrinsic 
activity and selectivity to propylene relative to Mg3V2O8 which was composed of isolated VO4 
species. The tetragonal VO4  are known to be highly selective to propylene product, and 
depending on the catalytic system, V=O bonds may steer the ODHP reaction towards the 
overoxidation [105]. The authors also revealed that there was no evolution of the α-Mg2V2O7 
phase when the Mg-V-O oxides were supported on MgO-coated SBA-15 via co-impregnation, 
even at higher V loading of 25.6 wt% [106]. Furthermore, the presence of Mg3V2O8 crystallites 
of moderate size (15–30 nm) led to more improved propylene yield relative to isolated 
monovanadates. The study revealed further insight to the structural requirement in terms of 
active components of the Mg-V-O oxide catalyst for enhanced ODHP performance. 
Despite the great tendency to agglomeration of VOx species (to form V2O5 phase) when 
supported on SBA-15, rehydration of the support prior to wet impregnation technique was found 
Journal Pre-proof
31 
 
to significantly improved the monolayer coverage up to 1.6 VOx nm−2 [107]. However, the less 
reducible polyvanadates and V2O5 (less selective phases) still predominate at higher V loading. 
Trotuş revealed significant modulation of the reactivity of lattice oxygens in a phosphorus-
modified CeO2 catalyst [108]. In both surface- and bulk-doped CeO2, increase in the P content 
resulted in improved propylene selectivity, with the over oxidation reaction significantly 
suppressed. However, the surface-phosphated catalyst had more well-dispersed isolated Ce4+ 
cations in contact with P (CePO4) that facilitated the ODHP more selectively, especially at low P 
loading, compared to the CeO2 benchmarked sample.  In addition, Fan et.al revealed that ordered 
mesoporous Ni-Mo-O catalysts synthesized via hard templating has displayed stable high 
βNiMoO4/α-NiMoO4 ratio and high propylene yield [109]. However, there was possibility of 
Mo diffusion into lattice of the NiO support, evident by the formation of NiMoO4 phase at 
higher Mo loadings (0.2-0.5). Notably, the presence of Mo suppressed the reducibility of the Ni 
species. Besides, Kim et.al found that incorporation of Zr into the alumina support to develop a 
thermally deactivated CrOy/γ-Al2O3-ZrO2 [110]. They observed doubled-fold improvement of 
propane conversion rate (µmol/m2.s) (in Cr/AZ-0.07) relative to catalyst with zero zirconia-
modification, and the dehydrogenation occurred via lattice oxygen species. This improvement 
was attributed to the enrichment in the active Cr3+ sites and the suppressed evolution of the 
inactive α-chromia-alumina species as evidenced from results of their UV spectroscopy probing 
of the coordination environment. 
Furthermore, Gomez et.al systematically investigated the impact of bimetallic interactions on 
CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP) and dry reforming (DRP) of propane on CeO2-supported 
catalysts [111]. The target products were propylene and syngas (CO + H2) respectively. In both 
processes, the catalysts are required to activate the CO2 on the metallic site or on the oxygen 
Journal Pre-proof
32 
 
vacancy of the ceria support. The catalysts were synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation 
and catalytic testing were done within kinetically controlled regime with minimal transport 
limitations. The Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, especially Ni3Pt1 sample among the M3Pt1 (M=Ni, 
Fe or Co) displayed superior stable propane and CO2 conversions (11.6 and 39.4% respectively 
at 823 K). Additionally, among the samples with nonprecious metals, CoxNiy and FexNiy were 
more active and selective for DRP and CO2-ODHP, respectively. Beyond Ni atomic ratio of 1, 
the selectivity functions in all the samples favor DRP. However, further study is still needed to 
optimize the structure-activity functions of the bimetallic catalysts via morphology tuning. 
Similarly, sub-nanometer Pt clusters stabilized on a hybrid SnO/Al2O3 support (Pt8-
10/SnO/Al2O3/AAO) were reported to be highly selective to propylene (21.9 % conv., 65.2 % 
select. at 500 oC) in ODHP [112]. The observation was attributed to interactions of the under-
coordinated Pt sites available in the small Pt clusters with the propane molecules. A DFT study 
on Pd(111) and Pd(211) revealed that irrespective of the surfaces and reaction intermediates, 
PDH or hydroxyl-mediated C-H activation are more favored compared to ODHP, indicating that 
the dehydrogenation kinetics is not significantly influenced by oxygen [113].   
Besides, Kharlamova et.al revealed that the sequence of integrating the active phase onto a 
support has significant influence on the phase composition evolution and consequently the 
catalytic activity [114]. The authors incorporated lanthanum into V2O5/SiO2 catalyst system, and 
they found that modifying the support (to form V2O5/La2O3–SiO2) was highly promotive to 
propylene selectivity due to formation of LaVOx phases. The trend in propylene selectivity 
followed the order V2O5/La2O3–SiO2 >> V2O5/SiO2 > La2O3/V2O5–SiO2. They also confirmed 
the formation a crystalline LaVO4 phase in the La2O3/V2O5–SiO2, which was suggested as the 
reason for the declined activity and selectivity in the sample.  
Journal Pre-proof
33 
 
Furthermore, synthesis of V-Zr-O catalyst via electrospinning offered advantage of achieving 
higher dispersion of catalytically active VOx species at high loading (up to 6 w/w% V loading) 
without evolution of V2O5 phase, compared to wet impregnation method [115]. Moreover, the 
transformation of zirconia from metastable tetragonal to monoclinic phase was suppressed, and 
the V-Zr-O catalyst had a fibrous morphology in submicron scale. Consequently, the catalyst 
displayed stable ODHP performance (17.4% conv., 27.4% select., at 350 oC) without observable 
deactivation ensuing. Usually, higher V loadings is known to favour the V2O5 phase formation 
[116], which could get reduced to the V2O3 phase after initial interaction with propane from the 
feed. The V2O5 phase usually prompts the dehydrogenation reaction to proceed via direct 
dehydrogenation route (PDH) [117]. The higher intrinsic activity of the V2O5 phase relative to 
monovanadate species (isolated VOx species) is due to its lower C-H activation enthalpies [118], 
and that is detrimental to propylene selectivity. In conclusion, understanding the structural nature 
of active sites involved in different catalytic systems and the various factors that influence them, 
is crucial to innovative design and tuning of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
(ODHP). 
2.6    Switching of active centers during ODHP process 
Obviously, active sites in catalytic systems require the right reaction conditions to set in, prior to 
becoming fully activated. In oxidative reactions over oxide catalysts, thermal activation of 
catalysts may prompt phase transition from a less active/selective phase to another which is 
highly active/selective [119]. As such, temperature ramping during reaction may result in 
modulating the relative dominance of the more selective phase, thereby ensuring variation in 
observed catalytic product distribution. Besides, depletion or decline in concentration of a 
particular kind of active site when a catalyst is investigated for time-on-stream (TOS) operation 
Journal Pre-proof

may prompt other kind of active sites to takeover. This will be obvious through dramatic changes 
in the product distribution that may ensue as the reaction becomes catalyzed via another route. 
Typically, as ODHP reaction progresses, the available selective lattice oxygen will be consumed, 
and the surface of the reduced catalyst will be more enriched with coordinatively unsaturated 
cations as active sites that usually facilitate direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH). 
 Typically, Xiong et.al investigated switching of active centers in γ-alumina-supported vanadium 
oxide catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). They synthesized 
catalysts with different VOx surface structure via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) to 
account for the variations in product distribution with time-on-stream [120]. The synthesized 
mV/ γ-Al2O3 catalysts had mass loading of V atom m = 1, 6, 20, corresponding to monomeric 
(structure I), polymeric (structure II), and crystalline (structure III) vanadium active phases, 
respectively (Figure 8). The results of the catalytic testing suggested a plausible rerouting in the 
reaction mechanism due to variation in the product distribution over time (Figure 8). At the 
initial stage, H2O was the major product instead of H2, indicating that ODHP was dominant. 
According to their results of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy 
(DRIFTS) coupled with DFT simulations, terminal oxygen species (V=O) available on the 
surface of all the three different catalysts facilitated ODHP during the initial phase of the 
dehydrogenation. With the depletion of the V=O sites, bridge oxygen species (V-O-Al) in 
structure I and II, and three-coordinated surface oxygen (V-O-V) in structure III switched as the 
active centers, steering the dehydrogenation via PDH route. Additionally, coordinatively 
unsaturated V atoms in the crystalline VOx catalyst were active for the PDH. The revelations 
from these structure−performance relationships is important in designing catalysts with requisite 
stable active sites to match expected product distribution.

Most recently, Jin et.al investigated structure-property relationship in CO2-assisted ODHP over 
Ru-promoted chromium oxide catalyst [121]. Through their C3H6 + CO2-TP-MS (temperature 
programmed mass spectrometry) experiments, CO2-TPD and CO2 hydrogenation experiments, 
they confirmed the occurrence of catalytic route evolution. Evidently, Cr10OX/SiO2 facilitated the 
reaction via direct dehydrogenation (PDH), and incorporation of 1 wt % Ru (RuCr10OX/SiO2) 
introduced RWGS and it shifted the equilibrium of the PDH towards more propylene. Further 
3wt% Ru incorporation (RuCr10OX/SiO2) introduced reforming reaction and it shifted the PDH 
equilibrium toward less propylene. However, a plausible reason for the multiple route evolution 
could be due to bifunctionality introduced by the Ru promoter in the active phase.

3.0   Strategies of tuning ODHP catalysts  
In this part, the discussion is focused on reported strategies in modulating crucial catalytic 
properties of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Interestingly, these 
methodologies could be utilized in tuning other heterogeneous catalysts, especially those for 
exothermic oxidative reactions such as oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The key 
properties discussed include oxide-support interaction, oxygen vacancy, acid–base property, and 
surface oxide reducibility. Fine-tuning these catalytic features has significantly contributed in 
improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of the ODHP catalysts reported. It should be 
noted that these properties are not strictly independent. As such, it should be expected that tuning 
one of them could results in modulation of another related property. But for convenience, we 
discussed the tuning of the properties under different subsections separately, and the discussion 
is mostly on metal oxide ODHP catalysts. Generally, the various strategies of tuning the 
structure-performance relationship of heterogeneous oxide catalysts is depicted on Figure 9. The 
aim of tuning catalysts is basically to improve their catalytic activity, selectivity and stability in 
particular application. Noteworthy, the extent of tuning the property-activity functions is also 
largely influenced by the catalyst synthesis methods and the physicochemical property of the 
constituent metals or their precursors. Table 3 provides a table of comparison for various 
catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

3.1     Oxygen Vacancy 
3.1.1   Origin of oxygen vacancy and its refilling 
Most of the catalysts explored for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are metal oxide systems. 
The oxygen species available within the lattice of the oxides are called lattice oxygens, and other 
kinds of reactive oxygen species with different catalytic behaviour under ODHP conditions may 
equally be present on the oxide surface. Koch et al  revealed that several oxygen groups 
including lattice oxygen (Olat), defect-related oxygen atoms (Odefect), adsorbed oxygen species 
(Oads), and hydroxyl groups (OOH) were available on  the surface of AMnO3 (A = La, Sm) 
perovskite catalysts, evidenced from ambient-pressure XPS analysis [122]. The authors found 
that increase in the abundance of the OOH and Oads oxygen species under wet feed led to 
significant improvement in propylene selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane

(ODHP). It should be noted that Oads oxygen species are electrophilic in nature and could 
participate in C-H activation at low temperature [99]. In an ODHP study with Au/TiO2 catalyst, 
the gold nanoparticles effectively activated oxygen species from the gas phase, and the adsorbed 
oxygens on the TiO2 were found to be responsible for propylene formation [123].

Obviously, the process of oxygen vacancy formation during oxidative dehydrogenation of 
propane (ODHP) begins through the direct participation of available lattice oxygen species in C-
H activation [22]. After the C-H activation, hydroxyl groups are formed on the sites. With the 
formation of water molecules from two adjacent OH groups and subsequent desorption, the 
lattice oxygens are consumed and oxygen vacancies are formed as depicted in equation 5. The 
vacancies generated on the reduced surface must be refilled before the next catalytic cycle. The 
vacancies might be replenished through subsurface lattice oxygen migration [138] or re-
oxidation of the reduced cations by surface-chemisorbed oxygen species from the gas phase 
[139] as depicted in the Figure 10. A redundant oxygen atom which could be more active 
compared to the restored lattice oxygen may ensue on the oxide surface in the later mechanism 
[140]. Depending on the nature of oxide, oxygen vacancy could be healed via nucleation of the 
reduced cations along with exposure of new underlying lattice plane [141]. The refilling process 
through surface-subsurface interactions in oxygen-free atmosphere might help to sustain the 
selectivity function of ODHP catalysts toward desired product.

The nature of the oxidants such as O2 or N2O strongly affects the rate of oxygen vacancy re-
oxidation [32]. In addition, the stability and position of an oxygen vacancy (whether located on 
the outermost surface or at a heterointerface) have great influence on how readily it is refilled 
[142]. On the same oxide layer, diffusion toward the surface is more favoured than in the 
horizontal direction [143]. Besides, oxygen vacancy (OV) may result from defects, inherent or 
engineered on the lattice of metal oxide catalysts [144,145]. A study on the kinetics of VOx/TiO2  
surface  re-oxidation by Słoczyński revealed that oxygen vacancies are quickly replenished at 
473 K by gaseous phase oxygen, with formation of nucleophilic oxygen (O(s)2−) exclusively at 
Journal Pre-proof
42 
 
temperatures above 550 K [146]. Obviously, modulating oxygen vacancy (OV) through surface 
engineering techniques could provide an important alternative for tuning the catalytic behavior of 
metal oxide ODHP catalysts.

3.1.2   Asymmetrical oxygen vacancy  
The local environment of an oxygen vacancy is a key factor that determines how the vacancy 
might significantly influence the catalytic behavior of the oxide catalyst. Recently, Yu et al 
reviewed an interesting approach in tuning oxide catalysts via exploiting asymmetric bonding 
configuration of vacancies in mixed oxide catalysts [148]. Single metal oxides usually have their 
lattice oxygens or vacancies symmetrically coordinated with their cations. Lattice substitution of 
one of the cations with another different metal may disrupt the symmetric coordination, resulting 
in formation of asymmetric oxygen vacancy (AOV) at the site.  An asymmetric oxygen vacancy 
(AOV) is a vacancy site that is coordinated with different cations in an unsymmetrical 
arrangement. Figure 11a and 11b depict some asymmetric oxygen vacancies on a doped-ceria 
and at interfacial region in an oxide-supported metal catalyst, respectively. Oxygen vacancy 
located within asymmetrically coordinated cations or at interfacial location in an oxide system

may present improved redox property [149]: an ability to have less energy barrier in both healing 
the vacancy by a dissociative adsorbed oxygen species from the gas phase and the subsequent 
release of the formed lattice oxygen during next catalytic cycle (Figure 11c). Figure 11d  depicts 
an ODHP mechanism where asymmetrical oxygen vacancy are the possible active sites [46]. The 
activation of the propane molecules proceeded via a heterolytic hydrogen abstraction. Most 
recently, Zhao et al reported successful introduction of transition metal (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) into 
the crystal lattice of CeO2 catalyst [150]. Such modulation prompted a spontaneous generation of 
asymmetrical oxygen vacancy (AOVs). The AOVs facilitated the activation and dissociation of 
water to reactive hydroxyl group on the oxide surface. Notably, designing of heterogeneous 
catalysts for tailored applications such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) via 
controlled interface formation in supported-oxide could offer alternatives in improving catalytic 
performance.

3.1.3    Strategies of tuning oxygen vacancy 
3.1.3.1 Doping with heteroatoms 
The crucial role that oxygen vacancy (OV) plays in promoting the catalytic activity of oxide 
catalysts in various heterogeneous reactions has prompted exploration of strategies to engineer 
and regulate the vacancies. One of these approaches is doping of the oxide catalyst with a 
heteroatom [151]. Generally, introduction of heteroatoms into the structure of oxides can result 
in significant modulation of the catalytic behaviour of the oxide. When one of the cations of an 
oxide is substituted by a heteroatom, significant changes could be triggered due to size effect or 
the quest for compensating charge imbalance. Usually, lower valence metals are introduced to 
decrease the cost of oxygen vacancy formation. This will then lead to improvement in the 
reducibility of the oxide [151]. Lower valence metals have high tendency toward oxidation to 
more stable higher valence state. The fact that oxygen is electrophilic in nature, the presence of 
the introduced low-valent dopant is expected to make the surface of the host more electron 
deficient, thereby inducing anionic vacancy creation to compensate for the charge imbalance.  
Moreover, depending on the nature of the host and the dopant, heteroatoms with larger ionic 
radius are likely to lower the barrier for oxygen vacancy formation more, compared to smaller 
ones [152]. Thus, the lowering of the energy for oxygen vacancy formation when lower valence 
cations are introduced may not be strictly due to contribution from charge compensation alone.  
 
Apart from chemical valence mismatch, intimate contact between the constituents of mixed 
oxide catalysts is crucial in tuning oxygen vacancy via triggered electronic interaction. Such 
intimate contact and interaction can be tuned via synthesis of the oxides in reverse 
microemulsion system  [153], through regulating the water/surfactant molar ratio as depicted in 
Journal Pre-proof
46 
 
Figure 12a. As the ratio decreases, smaller water-in-oil droplets are generated, leading to 
formation of smaller mixed oxides particles and better charge transfer among the constituents. 
Wu et al  found that such intimate contact in a Mg-La mixed oxide prompted electron transfer 
from La2O3 to MgO, and lowered the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the former [153]. 
In addition, more adsorbed oxygen species were formed on the MgO during calcination due to 
the resulting electron density. In such mixed oxides, the electronic charge transfer is only 
possible when the fermi level of the lower valence Mg species is below that of the donor (in this 
case, La2O3) [154], as depicted in Figure 12b. Otherwise, the charge transfer will be in the 
opposite direction. The fermi level of metals is located inside their valence band, and the fermi 
level at the interface of the Mg-La mixed oxide is expected to be modulated when the constituent 
species are in close contact [140,155].

oxide catalyst via microemulsion technique. b) Charge transfer due to difference in work 
function between a host oxide and a dopant. 
 
In oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), oxide catalysts, oxygen species that are much 
strongly bounded (highly nucleophilic) are more selective. This implies that for a catalyst with 
Journal Pre-proof
47 
 
loosely bound electrophilic oxygen species, increasing the barrier to oxygen vacancy formation 
is important for enhanced ODHP selectivity. However, it should be noted that increasing the M-
O strength to improve propylene selectivity is likely to come with a cost in propane conversion 
decline. As such, tradeoff in modulating the barrier to oxygen vacancy formation is necessary in 
order to have oxide catalysts with optimal reducibility and significantly improved activity and 
selectivity. Typically, Chen et. al revealed that Mo-doping in Mo-V-O mixed oxide ODHP 
catalyst resulted in significant modulation of the oxygen vacancy formation, as evidenced from 
their in situ characterizations along with DFT calculations [156]. The Mo-V-O mixed oxides 
were synthesized via co-impregnation process, and Mo-doping induced significant increase in 
the strength of the V-O bonds, leading to higher barrier in oxygen vacancy formation. The 
authors attributed the increase in the binding energy of the Mo 3d for Mo-V-O to possible strong 
surface interaction that prompted electronic transfer from the Mo to V. The charge redistribution 
decreased the proportion of the V5+ species, thereby limiting the evolution of unselective 
oxygens. This implied that the oxygen species (V=O, V-O-V and V3O) in the Mo-V-O mixed 
oxides became more nucleophilic in nature in comparison to those in undoped VOx system. The 
Mo-V-O catalyst gave conversion of about 36% with 89% propylene selectivity. In supported 
oxide catalysts, incorporation of inert materials such as TiO2 is another promising approach to 
tune the oxygen vacancy formation [157]. 
 
3.1.3.2   Regulating vacancy-rich oxides 
Control tuning of oxygen vacancy in vacancy-rich oxides such as ceria (CeO2) and zirconia 
(ZrO2) can open up their applications in diverse selective oxidative reactions. The vacancies 
Journal Pre-proof
48 
 
could be effectively tuned to tailored-reactivity by a guest molecule that can preferentially target 
vacancies, or via controlled reduction of the vacancy concentration. Notably, ceria has been 
applied in various catalytic oxidation reactions. However, due to its high oxygen vacancy-rich 
nature [158], it is seldomly applied to catalyze selective oxidative dehydrogenation without 
appropriate doping with heteroatoms. Otherwise, it is used as a support along with a different 
active phase.  Most recently, Liu et.al reported an effective strategy of boosting propylene 
selectivity of rod-shaped ceria catalyst (r-CeO2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
(ODHP) [159]. According to the authors, they achieved successful chlorination that targeted 
available surface oxygen vacancies without hydrogen treatment. The chloride ions (Cl-) 
preferentially occupied the superficial vacancies, prompting a drastic decrease in the amount of 
the vacancies (from 51% down to 15%) and simultaneous nucleation of oxygen species with 
modified chemical state (CeOCl). Moreover, the controlled chlorination raised the activation 
temperature of the catalyst by nearly 100 oC. The r-CeO2-HCl catalyst displayed superior 
propylene selectivity (from less than 5% to 50% at 450 oC) relative to the unmodified r-CeO2. At 
around 250 min time-on-stream (TOS), r-CeO2-HCl stabilized at three-fold propylene selectivity 
(25% at 450 oC) while both catalysts maintained comparable activities (around 10 % propane 
conv.)  Besides, use of molecular chlorine in ODHP over Ru/TiO2 catalyst resulted in 
outstanding performance (50% con., 95% propylene select., at 400 oC) [160]. The performance 
was attributed to formation of ruthenium oxychloride active centers. 
On another perspective, You et.al reported that controlled reduction of oxygen vacancy 
concentration in ceria-based catalyst via selective incorporation of niobium oxide (NbOX) had a 
profound positive influence on the ODHP selectivity [45]. The Nb5+ precursor preferentially 
interacted with surface oxygen vacancies of the hydrothermally synthesized CeO2 rods, thereby 
Journal Pre-proof
49 
 
causing a decline in their concentration. This modification resulted in drastic shift in the catalytic 
behavior of the CeO2 rods from propane combustion majorly, to oxidative dehydrogenation 
(ODHP). The propylene selectivity was nearly six-fold (48% at 300 oC) for a catalyst with 
doping level of 3.3 Nb atoms per nm2 of CeO2 surface. Nonetheless, the oxygen vacancy of CeO2 
could also be stepped up significantly by doping with smaller cations (Hf 4+and Sn 4+) that result 
in lower cation to anion radius ratio in the crystal structure [161]. This is achievable through the 
redox transformation of some of the Ce4+ ions (r= 0.097 nm) to Ce3+ (r= 0.1143 nm) leading to 
the release of some lattice oxygen to generate vacancies. Thus, the tunable surface chemistry 
available in oxygen vacancy-rich metal oxides such as ceria (CeO2) and other tailored-oxides 
such as TaO5 provides unique advantage in innovative design of novel catalysts that could have 
outstanding performance in ODHP reaction. These advantages include ease of creating new sites 
at interfaces or redistribution of the vacancies via thermal annealing or steam treatment [162], 
and target reduction in concentration of vacancies to achieve tailored-reactivity [45,159].  
3.1.3.3 Morphology-induced tuning of oxygen vacancy 
In the works of You et al [45] previously discussed, the authors improved the propylene 
selectivity of the vacancy-rich CeO2 through reduction in concentration of the vacancies. 
However, the vacancy-richness of the CeO2 can also be harnessed to design ODHP catalysts with 
improved selectivity without necessarily decreasing the oxygen vacancy concentration. Xie et al 
exemplified such alternative via a catalytic route that facilitate ODHP on CeO2-based catalysts 
with different morphologies in the presence of  (O2 + HCl) [163]. The authors suggested that the 
C-H activation was not facilitated directly by the available lattice oxygens or vacancies, rather by 
generated Cl• radical-like species. The mechanism begins with O2 being adsorbed on O-vacancy 
Journal Pre-proof
50 
 
site, leading to the formation of peroxide 𝑂2
2− species. The peroxide species are electrophilic in 
nature, and they oxidized the available Cl− into the Cl•-like species.   
Obviously, increasing the vacancy concentration on the surface of the CeO2 catalyst is beneficial 
in order to have more of the radical-like Cl• to selectively catalyze the C-H activation. As such, 
the authors increased the concentration of the oxygen vacancy (OV) in the CeO2 nanocrystals via 
morphology-induced modulation [163]. They synthesized CeO2 oxides with different 
morphologies and different predominantly exposed crystallographic facets. It was achieved via 
hydrolysis of Ce (III) salts in alkaline medium followed by hydrothermal treatments. The authors 
utilized Raman spectroscopy along with DFT calculation to investigate the variation in the OV 
among the catalysts. Based on their UV Raman results shown on Figure 13 (IA & IIA), the peaks 
at 592 cm -1 and 462 cm -1 are associated with OV and resonance Raman effect, respectively. 
Their ratios were used as estimate for the relative concentration of the OV, and the trend was rod 
> cube > octahedraon ≈ nanoparticle. The rod-CeO2 sample with predominantly (111) and (100) 
exposed facets showed the highest propane conversion rate.  
Besides, several dopants (V 5+, Mo 6+, Mg 2+, Fe 3+, Cu 2+, Zn 2+, and Ni 2+) were used to further 
tune the oxygen vacancy formation. Among all, the NiO-modified CeO2 nanorods resulted in the 
most outstanding ODHP performance (~70% propane conv., 80% propylene selectivity). A 
plausible explanation was that the Ni2+ cations were most efficient in triggering the redox 
transformation of the Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ species. The triggered redox transformation most probably 
ensued due to the quest to compensate the charge imbalance caused by possible lattice 
substitution of the Ce cations with a fraction of the Ni2+ low-valent ions. It should be noted that 
lower valence cations have propensity toward oxidation to stable higher states, and with such 
transition, the surface of the host becomes more electrophilic, thereby lowering the barrier to

anionic vacancy formation and modifying the surface reducibility of the oxide [151]. Apart from 
the lattice substitution by the Ni2+ cations, small NiO clusters were also formed on the CeO2 
nanorods surface.

3.1.3.4 Interfacial charge modulation  
Most recently, Lee et al revealed that interfacial charge modulation is a promising strategy to 
boosting oxygen vacancy (OV) on a colossal scale in hybrid oxides [164]. They utilized pulse 
laser epitaxy (PLE) technique to achieve epitaxial growth of CeO2/Y2O3 nanobrush structures, 
with the sublayers of the oxides interfacially connected via their {111} facets. Due to oxygen

52 
 
coordination mismatch at the (111) interface coupled with lattice expansion of the ceria at 
interfaced regions, a rapid transformation of Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ was induced (Figure 14). 
Consequently, huge amount of oxygen vacancies was excited at the heterointerface. All these 
were evident from their results of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and Scanning 
Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) corroborated along with a hybrid DFT calculation. 
Similarly, Wu et al reported that incorporation of Mn into vanadium doped CeO2 (VOX/CeO2) 
system with preferentially exposed {110} facets has facilitated more oxygen vacancy formation 
[165]. The catalyst was employed for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3. Despite the 
fact that these examples are not for ODHP application, it is obvious that controlled tuning of 
oxygen vacancy formation holds great prospects in revealing new horizons in the design of 
catalyst materials. And the ideas illustrated here could be used utilized in developing novel 
ODHP catalyst that could suppress the competing the over-oxidation reactions.

simulations. At the interface, there was simultaneous Ce3+ enrichment and rapid oxygen 
vacancies formation within the CeO2 [164].  
 
3.2     Acid-base properties of catalysts 
3.2.1   Origin of acid-base property 
Acid-base property is another important property of heterogeneous catalysts, especially in their 
oxidative catalytic roles. This property originates from the nature of electronic charge 
distribution within the constituent metal cations (acidic centers),  and the oxygen and hydroxyl 
groups (basic centers) located on the surface of oxide catalysts [166]. As such, changes in the 
lattice and electronic structure of the oxide catalysts is expected to influence their surface acidity 
and basicity, and consequently their catalytic behaviors. As discussed previously, oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is usually facilitated by surface available lattice oxygen 
species (in case of oxides) or hydroxyl groups (in case of other catalysts such as h-BN). The 
nature of the acid-base property of oxide catalysts modulates the interaction of reactant and 
intermediates molecules with catalytic surfaces, thereby significantly impacting on the 
performance and coke deposition tendency [167,168]. 
 
Figure 15 depicts oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on acid-base pair over ceria 
catalyst surface. The ODHP is initiated by electron and proton transfer from C3H8 to the 
oxidative site (Ce4+) and Brønsted base site (O2-), respectively [169], as depicted on Figure 15a. 
The nature and strength of the bonds between the acidic and basic site pairs determine the acid-
base character of catalysts. Accordingly, the sites could be qualified as strong, moderate, or weak

sites. Important techniques such as operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) 
spectroscopy [170], temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Fourier transform infra-red 
spectroscopy (FTIR with probe), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy 
(DRIFTS), synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES) [171] can be used to 
probe the nature and distribution of acidic and basic sites available on surfaces of catalysts.

3.2.2   Catalyst deactivation via coke formation 
Depending on the nature of the catalyst and operating conditions such as temperature, coke is 
usually formed on the surface of catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
(ODHP). As such, coke deposition on the active phase is a major deactivation phenomenon in 
ODHP catalysts. Some discussion about the influence of acid-based property in ODHP was made 
previously while discussing LDH-derived mixed oxides. The ODHP catalytic performance of 
Journal Pre-proof
55 
 
many LDH-derived mixed oxides correlates more to the strength of their Lewis and Brønsted 
acid sites than to their reducibility and other textural properties [92,93]. Olefins such as 
propylene have basic character, they are expected to strongly adsorb on highly acidic surfaces 
[172]. Typically, the high acidity and low basicity of an LDH-derived Mg-V-Al [94] and 
impregnation-derived Mg-V-Al [95] mixed oxides hampered the desorption of propylene on 
their surfaces, favoring oxidation of the propylene to CO products. A detail study by Blanco et al 
on vanadium supported catalysts revealed that the acid-base character of the support is decisive 
on the dispersion and the nature of the vanadium species that ensue [173]. Consequently, the 
catalytic behaviour of the different vanadium-supported catalysts differed in oxidative 
dehydrogenation of C2-C4, with catalysts having tetrahedral V5+ species being more active and 
selective. The presence of strong acidic protons in Fe-zeolites was found to facilitate deposition 
of coke in the active extra-framework Fe species [167].  
There are several strategies of suppressing coke formation on ODHP catalysts. This include 
careful doping of the active phase as exemplified by Crapanzano et. al in  La2Ni1−xVxO4+1.5x+I 
catalyst [174].  The authors found that the presence of the V species in the catalyst structure was 
beneficial in suppressing coke formation. The incorporated V species stabilized the available 
lattice oxygens and the over-stoichiometric oxygens, thereby inhibiting the evolution of the Ni 
metal species. The Ni species are known to decompose olefins into carbonaceous deposit 
(𝐶3𝐻6 + 𝐶2𝐻4 
𝑁𝑖0
→
 𝐶+ 𝐻2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of light. In addition, alumina is a 
thermally stable support with wide surface area, and has been widely used to support vanadium-
based catalyst for ODHP. However, the high acidity of alumina is not only detrimental to 
dispersion of vanadium species, but also promotes strong adsorption of propylene in VOx/Al2O3 
catalysts. Incorporation of basic oxides provides an alternative in modulating the acidity as 
Journal Pre-proof
56 
 
exemplified Rostom and de Lasa in V/γ-Al2O3 ODHP catalyst [36]. The authors revealed that 
use of a hybrid ZrO2-γAl2O3 support promoted evolution of isolated tetrahedral VOx species 
which are highly selective. Moreover, the chances of coke formation and cracking of reactant 
propane molecules and intermediates were significantly lowered, resulting in better propylene 
selectivity. It should be noted that other factors such as oxygen mobility may play a role in the 
coke formation, and appropriate doping with non-metals such as phosphorus  can provide a 
viable alternative in modulating the oxygen mobility [108]. Besides, ODHP catalysts deactivated 
due to coke formation must be regenerated intermittently by combustion of the coke in air. 
Adsorbed oxygens that are usually electrophilic in nature may also assist in the coke combustion 
during catalytic cycle. It should be noted that despite the effort in the search for a highly 
selective and stable ODHP catalysts, there is need to have more researches focused on 
understanding the deactivation mechanisms of ODHP catalysts, such as the works of Wu et. al 
[137]. This may provide further insight in understanding the catalytic requirements in designing 
efficient catalysts that could increase the economic viability of the ODHP process. 
3.2.2   Strategies on tuning acid-base property 
3.2.2.1   Doping with heteroatom 
Recently, Bakare et. al investigated reported modulation of the surface acidity of θ-Al2O3 in V-
supported catalysts to steer the catalytic function from the overoxidation route to enhanced 
olefins production [175]. Obviously, supports with high acidity such as alumina and zeolites are 
known to strongly adsorb the intermediates of ODHP reaction, thereby leading to production of 
more COx products [176]. The authors reported that incorporation of basic oxides in the VOx /θ-
Al2O3-M (M= MgO, CaO, or BaO) catalysts has significantly reduced the acid site concentration, 
resulting in improvement in the propylene yield. The presence of  Brønsted acid sites on host 
Journal Pre-proof
57 
 
lattice such as alumina is known to contribute significantly to higher activity but with suppressed 
propylene selectivity in ODHP [177]. However, from the work, there appears no general trend 
among the modified catalysts in their catalytic performance with concentration or strength of the 
surface acidity. Nonetheless, control of surface acidity provides a good handle to tradeoff 
conversion and propylene selectivity of ODHP catalysts.  
Additionally, incorporation of Mg into MgVOx/Al2O3 catalyst was reported to have significantly 
reduced the spike in acid site concentration caused by surface formation of VOx species as 
evidenced from results of their pulsed NH3 adsorption (Figure 16a) [178]. The reduction in the 
acid site concentration partly resulted in higher propylene yield. As the doping level increased, 
the Mg-modified catalysts have displayed better trade-off between conversion and selectivity 
(Figure 16b). High acid site density (especially strong Lewis acid sites) typically results in strong 
adsorption of the propane or propylene molecules, thereby favoring overoxidation reaction. 
Similarly, it favors the competing side reactions such as cracking and skeletal isomerization in 
non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium-based catalysts [179]. This suggests that 
balanced surface acidity is a prerequisite in enhancing the propylene selectivity of ODHP 
catalysts. Besides, Kantserova et.al reported the effect of acid-base character of In2O3–Al2O3 
catalyst on CO2-assited ODHP reaction. They suggested possible activation of the propane and 
CO2 species on the Lewis acid sites and basic sites, respectively [180].

Delgado et al conducted a systematic study probing the influence of various promoters (Me= K+, 
Al3+, Ce3+, La3+, Zr4+, Sn4+, Nb5+) on the catalytic performance of NiO catalysts for ODH of light 
alkanes (C2-C3) to olefins in a fixed bed reactor [181]. The catalysts were synthesized via simple 
evaporation of ethanolic solution of nickel nitrate and the precursor salts of the promoters. 
Catalysts promoted with high valence dopants (Nb5+, Sn4+ or Zr4+) had more proportion of Lewis 
sites, and that resulted in improved propylene selectivity (Figure 17a). In addition, catalysts 
promoted with these dopants showed lower concentration of electrophilic oxygen species (O-), as 
evident from their XPS analysis (Figure 17b). Obviously, promotion of the NiO catalyst with 
Nb5+ and Zr4+ cations has greatly limited the evolution of the unselective electrophilic oxygen 
species. Instead, the catalysts had more nucleophilic oxygen species (O2-), and consequently 
showed the highest olefins selectivity.

3.2.2.2   Selective substitution in flexible 3D structures 
Most recently, Petit et.al reported a proton conduction-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of 
propane on vanadium-modified hydroxyapatite (V-HAp). The catalysts were synthesized via co-
precipitation method [182]. The flexibility of the V-HAp 3D-framework offers advantage of 
controlled substitution of the Ca2+ ions or PO4 units to modify its composition and structure, 
particularly for catalytic applications [183]. Accordingly, the insertion of VO4 units into the HAp 
structure and their preferential relaxation in the subsurface resulted in more surface exposure of 
the Ca2+ - O 2- acid-base pair (Figure 18a). The authors suggested that proximity of the O2- basic 
site to Ca 2+ species led to stable catalytic performance in the C-H bond activation even at higher 
temperature. The nucleophilic O2- species participated as electron pair donors (EPDs) [184]. As 
the vanadium content (x) in the Ca10(PO4)6-x(VO4)x(OH)2-2yOy catalyst increased, the propylene 
selectivity increased, however, with a decline in the H2 production (Figure 18b). This suggested 
Journal Pre-proof
60 
 
high possibility of mechanism rerouting from being largely direct propane dehydrogenation 
(PDH) to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) at higher x value.  
The calcination temperature [185] and synthesis method [186] can significantly affect the 
insertion of the dopant (V in this case) into the HAp framework and tendency to agglomeration 
on the surface. The HAps could as well be used as catalytic support material [187]. Noteworthy, 
the ODHP mechanism over the V-HAps catalyst system proceeded via proton migration [182].  
However, since the system is an oxide catalyst, it might be also possible that the conventional 
oxygen mobility-mediated mechanism occurred concurrently. The ODHP mechanism on the V-
HAps catalyst via proton migration is depicted on Figure 12c [182]. In the mechanism, thermal 
activation of nucleophilic O2- species (EPD) (at 773 K) via proton mobility represents the initial 
stage, which is followed by C-H bond activation and stabilization of the hydride formed. The 
propylene product generated get desorbed. At this stage, when the mechanism is dominated by 
direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH), H2 gas would be released. Otherwise, H2O molecule 
would be released followed by oxygen vacancy (OV) formation in the VO4 unit when ODHP is 
dominant. The OV would then be refilled by the gaseous oxygen (O2) prior to the next catalytic 
cycle.

3.3     Metal Oxide-Support Interaction  
3.3.1   Choice and role of support materials 
In heterogeneous catalysis, high and stable performance of catalysts not only depends on the 
contribution from the active component and promoter, but also depends on the vital roles played 
by suitable support materials [188]. The electronic and structural properties of supports are 
Journal Pre-proof
62 
 
important variables that modulate the vital interaction between active oxides and support 
materials. This interaction is an interface phenomenon called oxide-support interaction. It 
influences the overall catalytic function of supported-oxide catalysts. As such, vital metal oxide-
support interactions are crucial in further promoting the performance (both activity and 
selectivity) of oxide-supported catalysts in various heterogeneous reactions such as oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The textural and physicochemical properties of supports 
are essential in exploiting the role played by supports in achieving well-dispersed, highly 
reducible, and stable catalysts [189]. These properties include the surface area, pore architecture, 
thermal stability, acid-base nature, redox potential, and morphology of supports. Besides, the 
method or strategy employed to incorporate the active phase to the support material could 
significantly influence the synergistic interactions in oxide-supported catalysts [190]. Different 
synthesis methods may offer varying control level in terms of the location and stabilization of the 
supported oxides in the catalyst system, and invariably the oxide-support interactions that ensue. 
This suggests the need for efficient and optimized synthesis routes in modulating the oxide-
support interaction. 
Obviously, examining extensively the integrity of various support materials which could ensure 
superior oxide-support interaction and consequently high stable performance is paramount. 
However, this should be carried out under different reaction conditions, and the phase of the 
support material, whether single or mixed phase should be put to consideration. This would help 
to screen the possibility of complexation of the active species with the support especially at 
elevated temperatures, which could lead to loss of catalytic activity. The complexation usually 
arises due to strong interactions during possible phase transformation of the support material 
[191], and drastic decline in surface area may be observed [177]. Depending on the nature of 
Journal Pre-proof
63 
 
support, partial breakdown of the support structure during calcination may also result in surface 
area loss [192]. Besides, poisoning of an ODHP vanadium-based catalyst was observed due to  
the diffusion of Fe species from the stainless steel substrate where the VOx active phase was 
coated [193].  
The use of appropriate structured supports may provide alternatives to reduce the susceptibility 
of hotspot formation in highly exothermic reactions. Especially during high temperature 
operations, hotspots in catalytic bed could impact severely on the selectivity function of oxide 
catalysts [194]. Most recently, Ramirez et’al investigated the impact of localized heating in 
microwave-assisted ODHP of VMgO-coated SiC monolith and foam-like monolith [195]. They 
revealed that the presence of straight channels in SiC monolith resulted in higher solid–gas 
temperature gradient due to less intense heat transfer. Consequently, the non-selective pathways 
were suppressed in the SiC monolith. Liu et’al reported microemulsion technique as an efficient 
approach which achieved high concentration of well-dispersed isolated VOx species on dendritic 
mesoporous silica (DMSN) [130]. In comparison to V/SBA-15, the V/DMSN showed higher 
ODHP activity and propylene selectivity, mainly due to improved oxide-support interactions. 
The V/DMSN had 3D and center-radial pore structure with good active site accessibility. In an 
ODHP study with VOx-supported catalysts, the variation in microstructure of the Al2O3 support 
was found to have slight influence on the oxide-support interaction [196]. The effect of the 
microstructure variation was more pronounced in mass-transfer and diffusion. Thus, oxide-
supported ODHP catalysts should be designed with the requisite structural characteristics for 
effective dynamic response to reaction conditions.

3.3.2   Strategies of tuning oxide-support interactions 
Typically, controlled tuning of oxide-support interactions to enhance the catalytic performance 
provides vital option in the rational design of ODHP catalyst. Active sites (oxygen species) at the 
interface region between an oxide and a support matrix could have improved catalytic 
performance due to enhanced charge transfer [149,197]. Interestingly, additional or new active 
sites with tune-reactivity could also be engineered at interface regions in supported catalysts 
[198]. A DFT study on correlating the adsorption energy of some catalytic intermediates at 
metal-support interface (late transition metals and MgO (100) support) revealed that interfacial 
adsorption sites are quite unique from those at terrace [155]. Moreover, structural and electronic 
perturbations at heterojunctions strongly defines the adsorption strength of these intermediates 
[199].   
Most recently, Deelen et.al reported a detailed review on the concept of metal-support 
interactions and strategies of regulating it to achieve improved catalytic performance [200]. 
Notably, oxide-support interactions may present in different schemes such as generation of new 
active sites or modulation of the inherent active sites available in the active oxide phase or 
increasing their population. Figure 19 depicts strategies of tuning metal oxide-support interaction 
towards improved activity and selectivity of ODHP catalysts and other heterogeneous catalyst 
systems.

Figure 19. Strategies of tuning metal oxide-support interaction toward improved activity and 
selectivity of heterogeneous catalyst systems. These tuning methodologies could begin from 
property screening of the support materials, or during the catalyst synthesis or during post 
synthesis stage through thermal or chemical treatment.  
3.3.2.1   Support modulation to tune oxide-support interaction 
Controlled modification of support materials in supported catalysts can enhance oxide-support 
interactions. Khan et.al studied the reduction kinetics of VOX/Al2O3 catalysts synthesized via 
excess solvent impregnation method. They found that incorporation of ceria into the γ-Al2O3 
support has weakened the strength of the interaction between the VOX species and the support,  
which led to lowered reduction activation energies in the VOX/Ce-Al2O3 catalysts [201]. The 
mild interaction brought about uniform dispersion of the VOX active phase, and the lattice 
oxygen species became more readily available. Al-Ghamdi et al have also reported similar 
conclusion with VOX/c-Al2O3 [202], Koirala et.al investigated cobalt-supported systems on 
single supports (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2) and hybrid oxides (SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-TiO2, SiO2-
ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2) synthesized via flame spray pyrolysis [203]. The variation in the oxide-

support interactions led to vast differences in reduction temperatures of the CoOX species. The 
authors revealed that the SiO2-supported catalyst had more well-dispersed CoOx species but also 
showed very high reduction temperature due to strong interaction between the active phase and 
the silica support. The strength and density of the acid sites of the silica support strongly 
influenced the interaction. This led to significant improvement in the reducibility of the cobalt-
SiO2 catalyst. 
A detailed investigation by Casaletto et al on supported vanadyl orthophosphate revealed that the 
best dispersions of the vanadium phase were achieved on Al2O3, ZrO2 and TiO2 due to strong 
phosphate-support interaction [188]. Such interaction led to enhanced reducibility of the 
vanadium phase, and consequently led to highest ODHP performance compared to the SiO2, 
MgO and SnO supported samples that showed significant VPO aggregation. The aggregation of 
the VPO phase in the later supports ensued due to strong preferential vanadyl-phosphate 
interaction, and it favoured overoxidation. In addition, Rostom et.al reported tuning of oxide-
support interaction of vanadium-based catalyst by incorporation of ZrO2 into γ-Al2O3 support via 
excess solvent impregnation [36]. Ammonia desorption kinetics of the hybrid γ-Al2O3-ZrO2 
supports revealed an increase in the desorption energy of the catalyst with higher ZrO2 content 
due to modulation in the interaction of the VOx active phase with the support. Consequently, 
7.5%V/ZrO2-γAl2O3 displayed improved performance (24.8% conv., 92.5% propylene select. at 
550 oC) in comparison to the unmodified 7.5% VOX/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, the support 
modulation prompted dramatic increase in the ratio of the Bronsted/Lewis sites from 0.94 to 2.2. 
The kinetic modelling of the catalyst [17] for ODHP and application of the catalyst in ODH of 
ethane [204] have also been reported.  
Journal Pre-proof
67 
 
As mentioned earlier, nature of oxide supports do influences catalyst-support interactions and 
consequently the redox property and stabilization of the dispersed active phase [205]. 
Morphological difference in active phases or supports controls oxide-support interaction [206]. 
Liu et.al reported a morphology-dependent interaction in CeO2-supported NbOX catalyst used for 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) [207]. The investigation involved NbOX/CeO2 
systems: ceria cubes calcined at 500 oC (c-CeO2) and ceria rods calcined at 500 and 700 oC (r-
CeO2–500 and r-CeO2–700). As the Nb (active phase) loading increased, the surface structures 
evolved from monomeric NbOX species to polymeric NbOX and CeNbO4 species. This implies 
that the Nb2O5 species dominated at higher loading, being the most thermodynamically stable 
phase. Interestingly, Nb5+ species preferentially interacted with oxygen vacancies on the ceria, 
resulting in more population of the monomeric Nb4+ species [45]. Due to morphology-dependent 
oxide-support interactions, the Nb5+ - Nb4+ species transformation was more for the rod-shaped 
catalysts (NbOx/r-CeO2–500) at higher NbOX surface density. However, the NbOx/r-CeO2-700 
catalyst had the least concentration of Nb4+ species, indicating that thermal treatment had 
significant influence on the oxide-support interaction.  
3.3.2.2 Active phase control to tune oxide-support interactions 
Apart from direct modification of support, the incorporation of a second metal (a promoter) or 
other dopants such as phosphorus into the active phase also modulates oxide-support 
interactions. Neto et al reported a vanadium-based catalyst supported on activated carbon (AC) 
derived from sugarcane straw [208]. The authors utilized phosphorous as a chemical activation 
agent for the support and it improved the dispersion of the VOx active phase. The well-dispersed 
AC-supported vanadium catalyst showed propane conversion of 30% and 10% propylene yield. 
Journal Pre-proof
68 
 
However, after 3 hours of stable performance (Figure 20a), a drastic decline in the activity 
ensued, suggesting a possible structure collapse due to carbonization. The authors revealed that 
surface enrichment of phosphorus made the surface of the AC support more oxidized and led to 
the formation of V-P linkage. Such V-P linkages are suggested to be the possible factors that 
triggered the structure collapse of the AC support, as suggested by XPS analysis.  
In a recent development, the group incorporated Mg species to the active phase of the AC- and 
MCM-supported vanadium catalysts [127]. They revealed that the presence of Mg-V linkages (as 
MgV2O4 phase) in the Mg-V-O catalyst supported on activated carbon (AC) led to stabilization 
of the supports. In addition, the coexistence of Mg2V2O7 and MgV2O6 phases on the MCM 
material significantly improved ODHP performance, despite the presence of V2O5 species at 
higher V loadings. The presence of MgV2O4 (magnesiocoulsonite phase) stabilized the active 
phase while Mg2V2O7 (pyrovanadate phase) improved the propylene selectivity of the AC-
supported catalysts. The stable performances of the Mg-V-O catalysts supported on Ac and 
MCM (Figure 20b) were attributed to the presence of Mg-V linkages, despite presence of surface 
phosphate groups that may prone structure collapse via V-P linkage formation [208]. This 
implies that the Mg-V linkages (due to interaction among active phase constituents) is beneficial 
in suppressing the detrimental effect of the V-P linkages, despite coexisting in the catalyst.  
Grant et’al reported that presence of small amount of sodium ions (Na+) significantly improved 
the dispersion of VOx species on amorphous silica due to weakened interaction of surface 
neighboring vanadyl group [209].

Similarly, Sushchenko reported incorporation of Mg species into the active phase of MgO-
V2O5/Al2O3 (VMgAl-x, x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) via consecutive impregnation to modulate the surface 
phases towards improved ODHP catalytic performance [210]. Consequently, as the Mg/V ratio 
increased from 0 to1.5, the composition and structure of the active species evolved from mixture 
of V2O5 and polymeric VOx to a mixture of Mg2V2O7 and V2O5 phases. This implied that 
modulation of the active phase via the Mg addition contributed to the evolution of a new 
Mg2V2O7 phase that forms synergy with the unselective V2O5. Such synergistic interaction was 
suggested to be responsible for the observed improved propylene selectivity. In other words, the 
effect of the non-vital metal-support interaction that precipitated the unselective V2O5 is avoided 
through the synergy of the active phase constituents. At 12% conversion, the VMgAl-1.5

displayed ~63% propylene selectivity while VMgAl-0 had ~ 52.5%. In addition, Ascoop et.al 
investigated a series of silica-supported WOx-VOx catalysts for CO2-assisted-ODHP [211]. They 
revealed that the tungstate-vanadate interaction significantly improved the reducibility and 
stabilization of the VOx active species during reaction. Also, the promotive role played by the 
WOx species prevented clustering of the VOx species which could have led to formation of non-
selective oxygen species, especially at high temperatures.  
3.3.2.3 Tuning oxide-support interaction via Synthesis method  
Interestingly, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is highly prospective in generating well-dispersed 
VOX  active phase on supports [212]. Most recently, Kazerooni reported that at the same V 
loading, VOX/TiO2 catalysts synthesized via ALD were more well-dispersed compared to those 
from incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) [214]. Also, vital oxide-support interactions in the 
ALD catalysts suppressed the diffusion of V4+ species into the titania lattice. The diffusion could 
have resulted in decreased accessibility to active sites due to induced anatase-to-rutile 
transformation of the TiO2 support [213]. Consequently, all the ALD catalysts had superior TOF 
conversion coupled with nearly quadrupled propylene selectivity compared to those from IWI at 
300 oC.  
Ruf et.al employed ALD (with graphene oxide as sacrificial matrix) to tune the oxide-support 
interaction in oxide-supported nanostructured vanadia catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of 
ethanol to acetaldehyde [215]. The generation of M−O−V (M = Al, Si) interphases (evident from 
UV Raman) coupled with higher dispersion achieved via the sequential ALD approach are 
suggested to be the reasons behind high turnover frequency (TOF) of the VOX/support catalysts. 
Fukudome et.al revealed a new concept of synthesizing mesoporous VOx/SiO2 with high density

of isolated VOx species via an alkoxyexchange reaction between silica and vanadia precursors 
with PEG [216]. The degree of polymerization of the PEG was tuned to control the synthesis 
process. The catalyst displayed 3% propane conversion and 88.3% propylene selectivity during 
ODHP. An illustration of the high dispersion of the VOx active phase in the silica matrix is 
shown on Figure 21.

catalysts synthesized via (a) alkoxyexchange reaction of silica and vanadia precursors with PEG 
and (b) wet impregnation. Incorporation of the VOx species into the silica framework via 
impregnation method showed higher chances of evolution of polymeric V2O5 phase [216].  
 
Generally, supported active phase usually exists as a mixture of phases, and some of the 
constituents might not be selective or active for a reaction. Notably, varying the ratio of 
constituents of the active phase can provide a handle to tune the oxide-support interaction to 
trigger phase transformation. As discussed earlier, Fan et.al reported ordered mesoporous NiMo-
based catalysts synthesized via hard templating technique [109]. They revealed that increase in 
the Ni/Mo ratio has significantly lowered the temperature (250 oC) for the α-phase to β-NiMoO4 
phase transformation [119]. However, achieving a good propylene yield requires a trade-off in 
Journal Pre-proof

tuning this transformation temperature, as α-NiMoO4 phase favors higher ODHP activity while 
β-NiMoO4 phase is more selective to propylene. Interestingly, a catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.4 
showed propylene yield of around 16% at 600 oC. Moreover, a soft templating technique via the 
use of self-assembled hybrid precursors showed prospect in achieving highly efficient NiMO-
based catalysts with improved surface area for ODHP application [217]. The evolved 
morphology of the catalysts was highly sensitive to the nature of the template used, and the 
graphene-derived VOx catalyst (V-A-G) displayed 47.02% conversion and 53.93% propylene 
selectivity at 450 oC during 6 h TOS. Calcination in air led to significant exposure of the active 
sites. 
3.3.2.4 Catalyst treatment to tune oxide-support interaction 
The use of additives such as polymeric ligands or alkali metals (Na and K) as chemical treatment 
agent in supported oxide catalysts could modulate oxide-support interaction. This tuning 
approach usually results in better dispersion of the active phase or improved isolation of active 
sites. Consequently, overall selectivity could increase due to weaken interaction between the 
desired product (propylene) and the catalytic surface. Du et’al reported that surface modification 
with polymeric phosphate has significantly improved the thermal stability and propylene 
selectivity function of a nickel oxide catalyst [218]. The ligand modification weakened the 
surface affinity of the generated propylene molecules, thereby resulted in 2 to 3-fold increase in 
propylene selectivity compared to unmodified NiO catalyst. Also, Goudarzi et’al reported that 
addition of potassium via incipient wetness impregnation into nanostructured titanate support has 
improved the dispersion of molybdena species [219]. The K-modified titanate-supported catalyst, 
MoTNT-10 (with 10 wt% molybdena) displayed high stable ODHP performance in terms of 
Journal Pre-proof
73 
 
propylene yield (from 9.3% to 11.3% at 500 oC) relative to unmodified MoTNT-x catalyst, 
despite the loss in specific surface area that ensued during calcination.  
Besides, tuning oxide-support interaction might be achieved via controlled thermal treatment of 
catalysts. Regulation of the temperature and gas phase environment used during calcination 
process can provide a handle to achieve tailored interaction between the active oxides and the 
support materials. This is important owing to the fact that surface enrichment and activation of 
active sites in oxide catalysts usually ensue at calcination stage. Additionally, during the ODHP 
process, desired structural transformation of the active species and modulating their synergistic 
role could be achieved via regulating the operating temperature and the prevailing gaseous 
environment [220].  
3.4     Oxide surface reducibility 
As discussed earlier, lattice oxygen species available at surface of oxide catalysts are majorly 
considered as the active sites for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction. However, 
it should be noted that the performance of the ODHP catalysts depends on how readily available 
these oxygen species are for direct participation in the reaction. These selective nucleophilic 
oxygens play the pivotal role of hydrogen abstraction from the propane molecule, and the oxide 
catalyst get reduced as a result. The surface composition of the reduced oxide catalyst becomes 
modified with the emergence of oxygen vacancies [221]. In several density function theory 
simulation (DFT) studies investigating the role of oxide reducibility in oxidative performance, 
the cost of oxygen vacancy formation is usually used as the property descriptor for the oxide 
surface reducibility [222].  
Journal Pre-proof
74 
 
Thus, surface oxide reducibility at typical reaction conditions is a crucial factor that controls the 
catalytic behavior of ODHP catalysts in terms of both conversion and propylene selectivity. 
Generally, oxides with higher heat of formation or higher metal-oxygen bond strength tend to 
display lesser surface reducibility. Metal oxides with high reducibility may be more susceptible 
to formation of COx products [223]. Usually, higher surface reducibility of oxides results in 
increased activity, however, beyond a certain degree, chances of the reaction path favoring over 
oxidation increases [224]. As such, optimal tuning of surface reducibility is paramount in 
designing ODHP catalysts with better trade-off ability between activity and selectivity to target 
product.  
3.4.1   Strategies of tuning oxide surface reducibility 
The electronic nature of lattice oxygen species may have influence on the reducibility of oxide 
catalysts. Lattice oxygen species that are more electron deficient (more electrophilic) are 
expected to display relatively lesser binding strength, and thus results in oxide catalysts with 
lower reduction temperature and higher surface reducibility. Such oxygens may promote 
oxidation of propylene molecules during ODHP [51]. This implies that appropriate modulation 
of the electronic property of the lattice oxygen species in oxide catalysts could have a profound 
impact on the oxidative activity and selectivity functions of ODHP catalysts.  The presence of 
vital interactions between the active oxide phase and the support material could also improve 
surface reducibility through enhanced charge transfer. Also, the nature of the oxidants (such as 
O2, N2O) may significantly influence the reducibility of VOx species, producing varying 
concentrations of selective lattice oxygen species and nonselective peroxo species [221,225].  
Journal Pre-proof
75 
 
The strategies of tuning surface reducibility of oxide catalysts span from use of support and 
modulating support properties, control of the chemical environment of the lattice oxygen species 
in the active oxide phase, to use of efficient synthesis methods that result in improved electronic 
interactions among the constituents of the oxide catalysts. Noteworthy, one of the excellent 
reviews on tuning reducibility of oxide catalysts is the works of Puigdollers [151]. It discussed 
extensively the key role played by nanostructuring, formation of metal/oxide interface and 
doping in modulating surface reducibility of heterogeneous oxide catalysts. In supported 
heterogeneous catalyst, tuning of interfacial interactions is crucial and could result in significant 
promotive effects in structure-performance relationships [226]. Figure 22a shows the various 
schemes involved in modulation of redox property of oxide catalysts. Figure 22b depicts some 
strategies of tuning the surface reducibility of heterogeneous catalysts toward improved 
performance.

property of oxide catalysts. b) Some strategies of tuning the surface reducibility of heterogenous 
catalyst for improved performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The extent of 
tuning the property-activity functions depends on the catalyst synthesis methods coupled with the 
physicochemical property of the constituent metals or their precursors. 
 
3.4.1.1   Tuning oxide surface reducibility via active phase oxide control 
Nadjafi et.al investigated the role of dispersion and reducibility on the ODHP performance of 
silica supported sodium decavanadate (Na6V
10 O28/SiO2 , less than ca. 2.6 Vnm-2 monolayer 
coverage) synthesized via IWI method [220]. They revealed that thermal treatment under 
different environment of air, N2 or ODHP conditions caused varying phase transformation, 
resulting in significant changes on the reducibility of the catalyst. Under N2 (an inert gas), the

benchmark catalysts αNaVO3 and [𝑉𝑂4]/SiO2 appeared to be structurally stable, whereas,  
Na6V
10 O28/SiO2 transformed to a reduced αNaVO3 phase (α′NaV2 O5/SiO2). This 
transformation resulted to poor activity of the Na6V
10 O28/SiO2  (450 −500 oC) , majorly due 
to predominance of the α′NaV2 O5 , as evidenced from their V and Na MAS NMR results 
coupled with Raman investigation. Notably, MAS NMR is an effective spectroscopic technique 
for probing the surface structure of active phases [227]. Subsequently, the high oxidative activity 
of the catalyst was restored with time on stream (3hr) due to formation of Na1+xV3 O8/SiO2 and 
βNaVO3 phases and their redistribution on the SiO2 support. The formation of the 
metastable βNaVO3 was unexpected due to its usual transformation to the αNaVO3 phase at 
temperatures quite below that of typical onset ODHP temperature [228]. All the phases had 
different crystal structures and unique coordination chemistry for the vanadium species (Figure 
23a). The redox cycle of the Na6V
10 O28/SiO2  is depicted on Figure 23b. In addition, the 
Na6V
10 O28/SiO2  catalyst showed good ODHP activity with remarkable propylene selectivity 
(Figure 23c). This clearly shows that tuning the coordination environment of the metal in the 
active oxide phase (V in this case) may significantly modify the surface reducibility.

Recently, Kharlamova et.al investigated the modulation of the surface reducibility of a 
monolayer MgVOx/Al2O3 catalyst synthesized IWI for ODHP [178]. The MgVOx/Al2O3 catalyst 
with varying Mg/V ratios was benchmarked with an undoped VOx/Al2O3, and detailed UV-Vis 
and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of 2D VOx and MgVOx species on the 
alumina support. The authors revealed that incorporation of Mg into the active oxide phase has 
significantly modified the coordination environment of the vanadium (V5+) species and the 
binding strength of the V-O bonds. This influenced the redox property of the catalysts, with

higher degree of reduction observed at higher Mg/V ratios (0 - 4) as revealed from their TPR 
results. It should be noted that  coordination structure of the metal in the active phase (vanadium 
in this case) has profound impact on olefin selectivity in ODH process (Figure 24) [229]. 
Obviously, the activity of the modified catalysts decreased, however, it was compensated with 
higher propylene selectivity. At 0.8 Mg/V ratio, double-fold propylene yield was recorded 
(4.7%), which decreased slightly at higher ratios. A similar observation was found with 
incorporation of ceria into active oxide phase of MnOx/Nb2O5-x catalyst for propane oxidation 
[230], indicating that control of the active phase can be utilized to tune surface reducibility. 
Moreover, Jalowiecki-Duhamel et.al revealed that incorporation of Ce into CeNiXOY mixed 
oxide has regulated the reducibility of the Ni2+ cations, inhibiting their complete and irreversible 
reduction [46]. This significantly improved their ODHP performance, especially after treatment 
of the catalyst under H2 atmosphere, due to absence of Ni species that are not re-oxidizable 
which could favor cracking reaction.

catalysts on selectivity to olefins and oxygenated product. [24,229]. 
Furthermore, Sandupatla et.al investigated the effect of CO2 on the ODHP performance of 
alumina-supported vanadia catalysts modified with Cr, Mo, and W [231]. They revealed that the 
presence of CO2 has not improved the rate of propylene formation on Cr-modified catalysts. The 
Cr-modified catalysts displayed much lower reduction temperature compared to the others, and it 
is only partially re-oxidized in CO2 stream as evident form their H2-TPR. Wang et.al reported 
that use of ZIF-8 as synthesis template has prospects in yielding Co3O4 nanoparticles with highly 
stable low-temperature ODHP performance [124]. The incorporation of the Co species was via 
impregnation technique, and the morphology and reducibility of the Co3O4 catalyst changed with 
variation in the pyrolysis temperature.  
3.4.1.2. Tuning oxide surface reducibility via support modulation 
Obviously, modulation of support properties can be achieved via systematic doping with 
appropriate metals (such as noble metals), support hybridization, or thermal or chemical 
treatment of support materials. Besides, synthesis method is another important handle that could 
offer effective tuning of surface oxide reducibility. Different methods such as hydrothermal 
synthesis [232] and flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) [233] do offer advantage of dimensionality, 
morphology and size control in synthesis of oxide catalysts, and consequently tuning of surface 
reducibility of these oxides. The difference in dimensionality and morphology can results in 
differences in the local coordination chemistry of the oxides. Obviously, lattice oxygen species 
located at low-coordinated sites (such as steps and corners) on the surface of oxides are relatively 
different in reactivity to those in the bulk [234]. An efficient synthesis method could be used to 
increase the density of the undercoordinated oxygen species and thereby fine tuning the surface 
Journal Pre-proof
81 
 
reducibility of the resulting oxide catalysts. The luxury offered by all these strategies in fine 
tuning surface reducibility hold great prospect in improving the low-temperature performance 
(LT-performance) of catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to 
propylene. 
Moreover, Liu revealed that tuning the morphology of CeO2 nanocrystal support has influenced 
the reduction behavior of NbOx catalyst for ODHP [207]. Depending on the morphology of the 
support, different exposed crystallography facets may dominate, thereby resulting in varying 
interactions of the active oxide phase with the support [158,165]. Accordingly, they found that 
that ceria rods (r-CeO2, mainly enclosed with {110} & {100} facets) resulted in more 
reducibility compared to ceria cubes (enclosed with {110} & {100} facets), all calcined at 500 
oC. However, calcination of the r-CeO2 at 700 oC (r-CeO2-700) suppressed its surface 
reducibility. Besides, increase in the Nb loading up to 5.1Nb/nm2 has significantly lowered the 
reduction temperatures of the NbOx/r-CeO2-700 catalysts. Additionally, support hybridization in 
VOX/γ-Al2O3-ZrO2 [204] and support doping in VOX/Ce-Al2O3  [201] catalysts were found to 
suppressed the oxide-support interactions. Consequently, the surface reducibility of the VOX 
phases for ODH of ethane became tuned. These works demonstrate the prospect of support 
modulation in designing low-temperature ODHP catalysts.

4.0   Toward Rational Design of Novel ODHP Catalysts 
In this section, highlight related to conventional and accelerated catalyst discovery will be made 
briefly.  The conventional catalyst discovery is basically the traditional try-and-error experiments 
used in screening and optimization of catalysts for various applications. For the accelerated 
catalyst discovery, it involves computational methodologies that are either data-driven, theory-
driven or a hybrid of the two in designing catalysts with optimal properties and performances. 
However, due to limitation of reported literatures on the accelerated catalyst discovery in 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), only a general discussion on the topic will be 
provided. Obviously, the accelerated catalyst discovery is highly prospective in facilitating the 
design and development of catalytic systems. As such, there is an urgent need to deploy such 
techniques in studies for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane and propane). 
4.1    Conventional approach 
Conventionally, discovery of catalysts for industrial applications usually stem from longtime 
experimentation by several researchers. Upon discovery of potential ones, large scale screening 
experiments are employed to optimize their compositional and structural properties. However, 
the space for the discovery and optimization of catalysts is wide, and catalytic performance 
depends hugely on the complex interactions among catalytic properties and operating conditions 
[235]. The most optimal catalyst could hardly be discovered through the trial-and-error approach. 
Thus, it is not surprising that industrially-viable catalysts with high stable performances are yet 
to be discovered for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene and oxidative 
coupling of methane (OCM). Besides, serendipity has been a fortune to scientific discovery and 
similarly in discovery of materials for catalytic applications. Most recently, hexagonal boron 
nitride (h-BN) [54] was serendipitously found to be highly active and selective for ODHP [236]: 
Journal Pre-proof
83 
 
opening a new horizon in exploration and screening of other potential B-containing catalysts for 
the process. Besides, V-Mg-O catalysts have also shown great potential in improving the ODHP 
process catalytically. A large number of catalyst have been reported for ODHP, nonetheless, 
their catalytic performances in terms of yield to propylene has remained below an economically 
viable level. As such, there should be a paradigm shift in the ODHP catalyst exploration to 
involve robust accelerated discovery techniques to expedite the search and optimization process. 
4.1    Accelerated Catalyst Discovery 
Accelerated discovery of novel catalysts through rational design and tuning of catalytic materials 
provides an important opportunity in dramatic improvement of many heterogeneous processes in 
terms of their performance and stability. The emergence of high-performance computing 
capability and efficient computational science are in the forefront in making paradigm shift in 
catalyst discovery possible. Notably, the accelerated catalyst discovery involves virtual design of 
the catalyst prior to the synthesis stage through screening of catalyst datasets or quantum 
mechanical calculations. The accelerated catalyst discovery can be classified into the following:  
I. 
Data-driven approach 
II. 
Theory-driven approach 
III. Hybrid approach 
In the data-driven approach, machine learning (ML) is the lead technique in computational 
catalyst screening that guides in rational design of new catalysts. The ML involves use of data 
generated through experimentation (or from literature) coupled with descriptive features to gain 
prediction of future catalytic performance. The descriptive features span from compositions and 
structures of catalysts, synthesis parameters, and operating conditions. The quality of information 
Journal Pre-proof
84 
 
embedded in the dataset strongly affects the derived descriptor–property relationships. In recent 
times, outstanding articles that provide guide toward excellent grasp of the data-driven catalyst 
design via ML are on the increase [237-239]. In literature, genetic algorithm (GA) [240], 
artificial neural networks (ANN) [241] and GA-tuned ANN [242] for discovery of catalysts used 
in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have been reported. Interestingly, McCullough 
et al have critically discussed these ML studies for screening and optimization of catalysts for 
ODHP application [243]. Besides, other techniques such as clustering algorithm (CA) [244] and 
principal component analysis (PCA) that require no specification of target property have been 
employed to reveal patterns and trends in datasets toward catalyst design.  
The theory-driven approach involves use of quantum mechanical calculation (ab initio or DFT) 
that allow for molecular-level optimization of both composition and structure of catalysts prior to 
synthesis, and offer the testing of the intrinsic catalytic behavior of the catalysts over a wide 
spectrum of scenarios. The optimization could involve various surface facets (terminations) and 
unique adsorption sites, and the result provides rational guide in design and development of 
catalysts with improved performance. As more complementary operando characterization 
methods are being developed recently, probing of the nature of interactions of product 
intermediates with active centers has never being more efficient [74]. Such interactions could be 
examined effectively via computation of adsorption energies involved [245]. Consequently, the 
insights gain through in situ characterizations coupled with computational investigations have 
offered vintage advantage in revealing more realistic structure-activity relationships of catalysts, 
and establishment of more precise reaction mechanisms. Obviously, the prospect of predicting 
the catalytic properties of active sites via robust quantum mechanical computations (DFT) is 
mounting, especially with more emerging outlines on breaking scaling relationships [246]. 
Journal Pre-proof
85 
 
Moreover, instead of the electronic or structural reactivity descriptors conventionally being used, 
hybrid descriptors are more utilized in recent times for more accurate predictions. Additionally, 
highly specific mechanistic details regarding process of catalyst deactivation are now better 
understood.  
A hybrid approach in rational catalyst design manifests when ML is integrated with high-
throughput (HT) data generation through experimental or quantum mechanical (QM) 
computational catalysis.  Interestingly, thousands of prospective catalysts could be screened 
through the framework incorporating ML with HT experimentation (ML-HTE) or HT 
computation (ML-HTC). Notably,  there  are many articles on the concept of ML-HT for rational 
catalyst design [235,238,243,247,248]. Besides, deep insight into reaction mechanisms could be 
gained via use of frameworks that integrate QM calculations with microkinetics and continuum 
model for mass transport [249]. It should be noted that Python language has enabled 
development of algorithms for high-throughput (HT) computation of target properties, and 
consequent deployment of ML algorithms to determine property-performance relationships that 
could aid design of novel catalysts. Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a free platform 
that provides Python interface to various calculation codes, allows building, control, running, 
visualization and analysis of atomistic calculations.  
Furthermore, availability of open web-based databases such as Materials Project (MP) (for 
electronic and structural information about materials) [250]  and NIST JANAF (thermochemical 
database) [251], Scikit-learn library (ML in Python) [252], CatApp (web app for catalyst design) 
[253] are hugely augmenting accelerated discovery and design of materials for catalytic 
applications and other fields. Obviously, accelerated catalyst discovery is a highly prospective 
alternative in discovering new materials with improved performances. It is important to have a 
Journal Pre-proof
86 
 
substantial number of future studies exploring the potential of all these techniques in better 
understanding of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), especially in terms of catalyst 
design and development. Moreover, the reaction mechanism and deactivation mechanism on 
various catalysts could be better understood.  
 
5.     Conclusion remarks and outlooks 
Design more efficient catalysts is urgently required to increase the economic viability of 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as a highly prospective technology for propylene 
production. Diverse research efforts in understanding the unique nature of the active sites, 
optimization of composition and structure of potential catalysts, probing of reaction mechanisms, 
and influence of various oxidants are on progress. Systematic tuning of crucial catalytic 
properties such as oxygen vacancy, reducibility, oxide-support interaction, acidity and basicity is 
imperative to provide effective trade-off in the activity/selectivity functions of ODHP catalysts to 
realize significant improvement in stable propylene yield. Obviously, studies focused on 
investigation of mass and heat transfer limitations in ODHP catalysts are very rare, and such 
studies could provide other alternative to improve the catalytic performance. Surface 
organometallic chemistry (SOMC) protocol can offer high degree of control in the grafting and 
isolation of active sites, and its potential in this regard should be explored extensively in ODHP 
application. Accelerated catalyst discovery through high-throughput experimentation and 
computation holds huge potential in the design and development of novel catalysts. Thus, it is 
crucial to deploy the accelerated catalyst discovery techniques coupled with advanced operando

spectroscopy to expedite catalyst screening for ODHP application. The following are outlines on 
the possible future research directions in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP): 
1. 
The nature of active sites of the various ODHP catalysts should be further explored 
effectively through systematic experiments coupled with detailed surface analysis and DFT 
simulation. 
2. 
Rational design and development of catalysts through accelerated catalyst discovery is an 
important area that urgently needs to be explored for ODHP application. 
3. 
Development of advanced reactor concepts such as chemical looping, alternative feed 
supply, dual reactor concept and layered-loading of catalysts could help towards 
improvement of the yield and stability of the ODHP process. 
4. 
The ODHP mechanism on various catalytic systems requires further systematic 
investigation. 
5. 
More investigations on catalyst deactivation and its mechanism could provide further 
understanding on other necessary requirements needed in the design of catalysts that could 
potentially improve ODHP.
