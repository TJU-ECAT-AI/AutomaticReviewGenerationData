Abstract: D/H exchange between methane and a zeolite is the simplest reaction between a zeolitic proton and a 
hydrocarbon. Because of its simplicity, it offers a unique opportunity to test out possibilities that are offered by 
present-day computational techniques to obtain theoretical insight into the catalytic action of zeolites and to test 
theory against experiment. We report the results of an ab initio quantum chemical study of the D/H exchange 
process between CD4 and a zeolitic cluster. Within this framework, a relation is established between acidity and the 
height of the barrier for exchange. This allows for the estimation of differences in the exchange barrier between 
various zeolites, of which HY (FAU) and HZSMJ (MFI) are explicitly considered. Transition state theory is used 
to quantitatively 
predict the rate constant of the exchange process. The results compare favorably with D/H exchange 
experiments that have recently been performed. 
1 Introduction 
Conversion of hydrocarbons in zeolites, functioning as solid 
acid catalysts, is widely used in the chemical and petrochemical 
industries. Understanding of the catalytic process at the 
molecular level is considered an important aid in the area of 
catalyst research and development. The tremendous increase 
in computing power of recent years allows us to complement 
experimental results with accurate ab initio quantum chemical 
calculations on realistic model systems (see, e.g., the review 
by Sauer). The level of detail of the information contained in 
these theoretical results greatly facilitates the interpretation of 
experimental results. 
In this paper we study theoretically the simplest reaction 
between a hydrocarbon and an H-zeolite, namely the exchange 
of hydrogen between methane and the zeolites HY (Faujasite 
or FAU) and HZSM-5 (or MFI), which are both well-studied 
but crystallographically very different zeolites. The chemical 
activation of CHq by a zeolitic proton can be considered a 
prototype for the activation of larger hydrocarbons via car- 
bonium ion formation. Such positively charged carbonium ions 
with pentacoordinated carbon atoms have been postulated to 
be intermediate in monomolecular cracking 
The 
proton exchange reaction of methane can be probed experi- 
mentally by isotope-labeling of either methane or the zeolite,

Given the supposed acid character 
of the process, a theoretical

for which theoretical predictions have recently become

aailable.- 
In these studies, proton affinities were computed 
using lattice energy calculations that are based on classical two- 
and three-body interaction potentials deduced from quantum 
chemical cluster  calculation. The use of classical force fields 
in these calculations allows one to include the effects of lattice 
relaxation upon (de)protonation, as well as that of long-range 
electrostatic interactions. The importance of including both of 
these effects is well documented.8-10 
In order to correctly predict the energy for proton transfer 
between a zeolite and a basic molecule, ab initio cluster 
calculations have shown11-13 that a combined geometry- 
optimization of the zeolite and sorbed molecule is essential in 
order to obtain a proper balancing of the energy cost of charge 
separation and that inclusion of the energy gained by zwitter- 
ionic interaction is essential. Because of this geometry- 
optimization requirement, the formation of a carbocationic 
carbonium ion from methane, Le., the transition state of the 
exchange process, can only be studied within the ab initio 
approximation by using the zeolite cluster approximation. 
The work to be presented here provides a synthesis of the 
two extreme approaches, Le., between the quantum chemical 
cluster approximation and the classical lattice energy ap- 
proximation. A brief summary of this work has been presented 
earlier., Here, we give a more detailed account of the way in 
which the theoretical results were derived.

 D/H 
Exchange in Zeolites 
In section 2 we present the results of quantum chemical 
calculations of the exchange process between CDa and a zeolitic 
cluster. Special attention is given to the simulation of differ- 
ences in proton affinity in these clusters, thereby establishing a 
connection between the zeolite cluster and the actual zeolite. 
where the variation in proton affinity (or acidity) is one of the 
reasons for the variation in reactivity observed in different types 
of zeolites. In section 3, the results of the quantum chemical 
calculations are used as input to calculate the exchange rate 
using transition state theory. In section 4, we quantify the 
differences in reaction rate between the zeolites FAU and MFI. 
taking differences in proton affinity and steric accessibility of 
the reaction site explicitly into account. Also, an upper limit 
to the exchange rate in any acidic aluminosilicate is given. The 
final sections are reserved for comparison with the experimental 
data (section 5 )  and for concluding remarks (section 6). 
2. Ab Initio Quantum Chemical Calculations on the DIH 
Exchange hetween Methane and a Zeolitic Cluster 
In this section, we will discuss the geometry of the minima 
and transition state along the reaction pathway for D/H 
exchange, the corresponding reaction harrier and its dependence 
on the basis set and size of the zeolite cluster (subsection 2.1). 
and the relationship between the reaction barrier and proton 
affinity (or acidity) of the zeolite cluster (subsection 2.2). 
As the distinction between the hydrogen isotopes is irrelevant 
for all aspects of the calculations-except for the determination 
of vibrational frequencies-we 
will usually not explicitly men- 
tion the isotope. 
2.1. The Exchange Path. In all our quantum chemical 
calculations, 
the infinite zeolite lattice is represented by a small 
zeolitic cluster: either the trimer H3SiO(H)AI(OH)>OSiH3 
or 
the monomer HO(H)AI(OH), in which the two terminal SiH3 
groups have been replaced by hydrogen atoms. The molecular 
system used in the calculations consists of one of these zeolitic 
clusters and a methane molecule. 
Figure 1A shows the geometry-optimized structure cor- 
responding to the adsorption minimum of methane and the 
zeolite cluster. This minimum is taken to obey C, symmetry, 
with the mirror plane defined by the plane of Si-O(H)-AI- 
0-Si (H-O(H)-AI-0-H 
for the monomers). 
Three possible transition state geometries were tested by 
quantum chemical geometry optimization using different starting 
geometries with different geometrical constraints. The opti- 
mized structures are shown in parts B-D of Figure 1. For the 
standard 3-21G basis set, the corresponding energies are listed 
in Table 1. Clearly. the exchange path where two different 
oxygen atoms are involved (B) is favored over the one that 
involves just a single oxygen atom (C). Likewise, transition 
state B is favored over a transition state where the CD5 fragment 
resembles the ionic C3,-symmetric conformation (D). 
This clear 
energetic preference proves the D/H exchange procees via 
transition state B. The same transition state is also reported in 
a recent paper by Evleth et 
In what follows we will use 
that transition state conformation. 
The transition state has a new plane of symmetry. perpen- 
dicular to that of the minimum; the mirror symmetry in this 
plane is lost in the transition state due to the 60 rotation of the

(15) The C, symmetric cluster is not the global energy minimum of these 
clusters. This would require CI symmetry. allowing for relative rotation 
of the terminal SiHi and OH groups. As these groups do not take pal in 
the exchange process. this is a valid approximation,

only the CH3 fragment, we have chosen to retain this geomehical 
symmetry for the zeolite fragment. 
Proof that a molecular structure represents a transition state 
is provided by a vibrational analysis of the structure. Ideally. 
a minimum-energy stmcture has positive vibrational frequencies 
only, while a transition state has one negative (imaginary) 
frequency, corresponding to the reaction coordinate. A detailed 
discussion of the vibrational spectra is given in section 3. It 
suffices at this point to mention that the eigenmode associated 
with the imaginary frequency, as shown in Figure 2, is the proper 
reaction coordinate for D/H exchange involving two oxygen 
sites.

to geometty optimization in a number of basis sets of increasing

field (SCF) level. To check the influence of cluster termination, 
additional calculations have been performed on monomer 
clusters. Because of their reduced size, single-double con- 
figuration interaction calculations (SDCI) are possible and give 
an indication 
of the influence 
of correlation 
on the barrier height. 
The results are given in Table 2. There are systematic 
variations 
which are of some interest: the barrier increases upon the 
extension of the basis set and decreases significantly when 
correlation effects are taken into account. The influence of 
variation of the cluster size is relatively minor. Because SDCI 
covers only part of the correlation energy,17 we estimate the 
proper value for the exchange barrier to be 1.6 & 0.3 eV. 
At first glance, the transition state seems to resemble a CH5+ 
ion close to the zeolite cluster. However, inspection of the 
overlap populations of the various bonds in the cluster (Table 
3) reveals that the transition state is covalently bonded rather 
than ionically bonded. Significant features are the halving of 
the OH and CH overlap population for the hydrogen atoms 
transferring between the minimum and transition state and the 
invariance of the sum of the overlap populations between Al 
and the two oxygen atoms involved in the exchange. 
The interatomic distances tabulated in Table 4 
corroborate 
the idea of exchange as a covalent process. They show that, in 
the transition state geometry, the average A1-0 bond length is

Also, the exchanging hydrogen atoms are in between the oxygen 
and carbon atoms at roughly equal bonding distances, although 
there is a considerable change in the hydrogen bond lengths 
upon addition of polarization functions. 
2.2. Relation between Reaction Barrier and Proton 
Affinity. In the above, we have represented the infinite zeolite 
by a small, zeolitic cluster. Since our main interest is in 
reactions 
in zeolites, which are extended systems 
of considerable 
heterogeneity, we have to take the heterogeneous nature of 
zeolites and of zeolite acidity into account. To this end, we 
focus on nonideal clusters in which the influence of an extended 
lattice on local properties, specifically acidity, can be studied. 
In an earlier work6 we showed that the proton affinity of 
zeolites, which is the theoretical measure of zeolite acidity, is 
modified by both chemical and structural variations in the zeolite 
lattice. In the same reference, it was shown that the variation 
in proton affinity may be mimicked by constraining the 
peripheral bonds of the zeolite cluster. By assignment of 
different bond lengths to the terminal Si-H bonds in subsequent 
calculations, the proton affinity may be varied over a range of 
1-2 eV, which is of the same order of magnitude as the 
expected variation in zeolites. 
Table 5 and Figure 3 show the dependence of the exchange 
barrier on changes in the proton affinities of both oxygen sites 
involved. As indicated before, the proton affinities were varied 
by adjusting the Si-H bond length of the peripheral groups. 
All other geometric degrees of freedom were optimized. As 
can be seen from the figure, the barrier (Bo, in eV) is only 
weakly dependent on the proton affinity (PA or 43):

Here, 14.47 eV is taken as a reference point for the proton 
We have also investigated 
the dependence of the barrier height 
on proton affinity differences: the proton affinities of the two 
oxygen sites involved were made nonequivalent by setting the 
terminal bond lengths of the two SiH3 groups to different values. 
The resulting loss of symmetry required a different search 
method for optimization of the transition state from that for the 
symmetric case. This required more computing time but yielded 
results of the same quality. Figure 4 shows the result, based 
on the energy data given in Table 6. Correcting these values 
for the weak dependence of B on G ( e q  2), we find a clear 
dependence of B on the proton affinity difference (de):

(3) 
Note that the barrier is always expressed relative to the minimum 
with the lowest energy, i.e., 
by the proton attached to the oxygen 
site with the highest proton affinity. 
We have verified that these results, which were obtained at 
the 3-21G level, are essentially retained when using a larger 
(6-31G**) basis set. Data are given in Table 6. The results 
with this basis set are described by 
Bo = 
2.385 + 
0.06(8- 14.47) 
Bo = 
2.385 + 
0.6164?1 
(4) 
(5) 
In later sections we will neglect the (weak) dependence of the 
barrier on the proton affinity and use 
where B: denotes the energy difference between the sorption 
minimum and the transition state, estimated as 1.6 f 
0.3 eV. 
The constant of proportionality between barrier and proton 
affinity differences (6) 
is approximately 0.7. 
The rationale behind the dependence of the exchange barrier 
on proton affinity differences, rather than on the proton affinity 
itself, is the retention of covalent bonding between methane (or 
the CH5 fragment) and the zeolite in the transition state. Figure 
5 shows the expected dependencies for an ionic transition state, 
one that is completely decoupled from the zeolite cluster 
(free), and for a transition state which retains the covalent 
bonding of acid hydrogen with the zeolite (coupled). In the 
first case, the transition state energy is unaffected by the proton 
affinity of either of the oxygen atoms. In the coupled case, 
the transition state energy level should be determined by the 
average proton binding strength of both oxygen atoms. 
It is important to note that in the case where the two oxygen 
atoms have different proton affinities, the activation energy o
f
 
the exchange process is determined by the barrier measured with 
repect to the minimum of lowest energy, i.e., 
where the proton 
is bonded to the oxygen atom with the highest proton affinity. 
For the reverse exchange path, the activation energy is smaller 
by an amount d e ,  and the population of that oxygen site is 
smaller by a factor exp(-d@/kr), 
canceling the effect of the 
lower activation energy. In this situation, it is assumed that 
there is thermal equilibrium between the proton population of 
both oxygen sites. This is indeed the case; according to Sauer 
et a1.,18 
the barrier for direct proton exchange between neighbor-

3. Transition State Theory of the D/H Exchange 
Reaction 
In this 
section we explicitly calculate the DM exchange rate 
from semiclassical transition state theory, using on ab initio 
quantum chemical data. For the details of the theory we refer 
to Glasstonelg and Rice.2o The D/H exchange reaction is

with k denoting the rate constants. When diffusion is fast and 
there is an excess amount of CD4, the backward reaction, as 
well as any further reactions of CD3H, may be neglected (kb =

in m  l m -  .  
The exchange reaction will proceed from an initial 
state (CD4 + HZ), 
via an activated complex, to a final state

i.e., assuming thermodynamic equilibrium between the initial 
state and the activated complex and separability of the reaction 
coordinate, the exchange rate can be expressed as a product of 
partition functions (ll) 
where the subscript TS refers to the transition state complex, 
HZ 
to the zeolite cluster, and the prime indicates that the reaction 
coordinate is not considered in the evaluation of the transition 
state partition function. V is the volume of the system. We

is irrelevant since only the ratio I I  T  E  
appears in the 
expression for the exchange rate. From a molecular viewpoint, 
it is evident that extension of a zeolite cluster does not affect 
the result since additional degrees of freedom cancel each other 
in l T  f l m .  
Obviously, explicit calculations should be based 
on a zeolite fragment of such size that its termination does not 
affect the transition state in any way other than for the minimum 
energy configuration. 
So far we have not been explicit about the nature of the initial 
state. We have implicitly used a molecular picture where 
collisions between methane and a HZ molecule lead to 
exchange reactions. In reality, methane from the gas phase first 
has to be adsorbed into the zeolite pores, and only then can it 
exchange one of its hydrogen atoms with one of the zeolites 
acid groups. However, this pre-equilibrium does not change 
the expression for the rate constant. If the adsorption step is 
explicitly accounted for, the rate constant becomes the product 
of the equilibrium constant for adsorption and the rate constant 
for exchange from the adsorption complex. The first is directly 
proportional 
to the partition function of the adsorption complex, 
while the latter is inversely proportional to it, which cancels 
their contribution to the product. In physical terms the 
experimental condition of constant gas pressure implies that the 
gas phase is the reference point for all calculations and that the 
intermediate state drops out of the equations. 
3.1. Vibrational Spectrum of the Initial State and of the 
Transition State. As is clear from the above discussion of 
transition state theory, the explicit calculation of rate constants 
requires knowledge of all excited states of both the minimum 
and transition state in order to evaluate the partition sum. It is 
known that ab initio calculations overestimate vibrational 
frequencies systematically 
by approximately 
However, 
this overestimation does not have a major effect on the 
calculated 
rate constants, 
and no corrections have been applied 
to the directly calculated frequencies. 
At the 3-21G-SCF level we have determined the vibrational 
spectrum of the minimum (the absorption complex) and the 
transition state from the computed matrix of second derivatives 
of the energy with respect to the atomic coordinates. The atomic 
weights of the hydrogen atoms have been taken as required for 
the specific D/H exchange process

A list of the frequencies is given in Table 7, and a graphic 
representation is shown in Figure 6 where all 57 modes of 
vibration are separated according to their nature. It appeared 
that all modes could be unambiguously assigned to either the 
zeolite cluster, to CD4, or to the acidic OH bond. When 
minimum and transition state modes are compared, differences 
will be expected mainly in the latter two categories. Indeed, 
all 39 modes that are ascribed to the zeolite-excluding the acid 
OH vibrational modes-are at approximately the same frequency 
for the minimum and for the transition state. Assignment of 
HZ 
modes is as follows: modes below 1300 cm- are SiO/

 vibrational modes, similar to those observed in zeolites, 
and modes around 2300 and 4100 cm- are terminal OH and 
SiH stretch modes, respectively. There are a few modes with 
small negative frequency, as a spurious consequence of the C, 
symmetry of the cluster. Since these modes correspond to 
rotation of terminal groups, they are of no consequence for the 
exchange process. 
Important shifts occur in the OH and CD4 frequencies (lower 
half of the figure). The OH stretch vibration (at 3890 cm-) 
disappears in the transition state and so do the six very low 
frequency modes that describe the loose coupling between 
methane and zeolite in the adsorption state. In their places, we 
find a large negative frequency (- 1423 cm-) that corresponds 
to the reaction coordinate, and six modes between 20 and 710 
cm- that describe the zeolite-CD4H coupling in the transition 
state. The 20 cm- frequency corresponds to the rotation of 
the CD3 group. For the minimum, the acid OH group has 
bending modes at 631 and 1212 cm-; nine other modes 
between 1200 and 2500 cm- are internal CD4 modes. These

frequencies determine to a large extent the entropy reduction 
in the transition state and thereby the reaction probability. 
Below, we will discuss this point further. 
As discussed above, the reference point for the calculation 
of the rate constant is the gas-phase CD4 molecule. Its 
vibrational frequencies have been calculated separately at the 
same computational level (see Table 7); they do not differ much 
from the values obtained for the adsorption minimum where 
CD4 is close to a zeolite cluster. 
In assessing the dependence of reaction rate on zeolites 
(section 4
)
 
we will focus solely on variations in the exchange 
barrier. 
Since vibrational frequencies determine the pre- 
exponential factor of the reaction rate, it is worthwhile to check 
the extent to which these are influenced by proton affinity 
differences between sites. We compared the transition state 
vibrational frequencies of two clusters that have proton affinity 
differences of 0 and 0.08 eV, respectively. It was found that 
We define EO 
as 
the ground state energy of the system, excluding 
zero-point contributions.

or simply 
The translational and rotational partition functions of the zeolite 
and the transition state cancel each other because the real zeolite 
is an infinite system, 
even though this is not true for the zeolite 
cluster. B is the barrier height, which is formally equal to ETS 
- 
ECD 
- 
Em. Note that the barrier as defined here does not 
contain the zero-point vibrations. These are contained in the 
prefactor ro, which is the same for all zeolites. The only zeolite- 
dependence is contained in the barrier B. 
On the basis of the vibrational data of the cluster calculations, 
nTS,vib includes 56 modes of the transition state cluster: 39 
are zeolite modes and 18 stem from the CDJ-I fragment. The 
reaction coordinate vibration is excluded. &D4,vlb 
contains 9 
vibrations 
and n w , v i b ,  38. An additional 
six degrees of freedom 
are accounted for in 
c
D
,

 
and &D4,rot. 
As indicated above, 
the vibrational modes of the zeolite are approximately the same 
in the minimum and in the transition state. Hence, their 
contribution cancels out in the rate expression. Thus, the only 
modes that need to be taken into account explicitly are those 
for CD4 and OH. 
So far, we have implicitly assumed a single transition state 
and a single minimum. For any acid A104(+H) tetrahedron 
the minimum (HZ) 
is 4-fold degenerate (four equal oxygen 
atoms) and the transition state, 6-fold (each of the six ribs of 
the tetrahedron may accommodate the transition state complex). 
However, 
when the tetrahedron is embedded in an infinite zeolite 
lattice, not all sides of the tetrahedron are accessible 
for methane. 
Hence, in practice this degeneracy is reduced to five. This point 
will be discussed further in section 4. Thus, when degeneracy 
is taken properly into account, eq 16 should be multiplied by 
Together, the above allows us to evaluate ro numerically. 
Comparison of the results with experimental 
findings is deferred 
to section 5. 
3.3. Quantum Corrections. The above treatment of the 
reaction rate is termed semiclassical since it is assumed that a 
reaction can take place only when the energy is greater than or 
equal to the barrier energy thereby neglecting the possibility of 
tunneling 
through the barrier. Since we are discussing 
exchange 
of protons, for which quantum effects are often important, we 
have estimated the quantum correction to the semiclassical 
results. 
Following 
Johnston,23 
we have assumed that the reaction path 
is one-dimensional and consists of two semi-infinite stretches

(23) Johnston, H. S. Gas Phase Reaction Rate Theory; Ronald Press: 
where the energy is constant (initial and final state), separated 
by a smooth potential barrier (transition state) of the so-called 
Eckart-type. Using the previously calculated values for the 
barrier height and the imaginary frequency of the reaction 
coordinate, we find only a moderate quantum correction to the 
reaction rate, varying between a factor of 2 at 500 K and 1.2 at 
1000 K. 
In conclusion, quantum corrections are not very large, 
indicating that even though we are dealing with hydrogen and 
deuterium, the system is essentially classical, and tunneling is 
not dominant. 
3.4. Semiclassical Interpretation o
f
 
the Transition State. 
The above calculation of reaction rates was rather formal, 
leaving little opportunity to check if results are chemically or 
physically reasonable. A different approach to reaction rates 
is to start with the collision rate (ro) between CD4 and acid 
protons.24 
ro = 
aiis[HZ][CD4] 
(18) 
Here u 
is the collision cross section of CD4 (  6  
A2), 
and ti, is 
the average thermal velocity with which CD4 hits the zeolite 
surface, which equals 
Naturally, the reaction rate (rf) 
is proportional to the product of 
the collision rate and the thermal probability of crossing the 
barrier: 
(20) 
= 
pr e-BIkT 
f
o
 
Here we have introduced 8, which differs from B by the 
inclusion of zero-point vibrational energies. The constant of 
proportionality P is known as the steric factor and can be used 
to define the reactive crosssection (T*: 
(T* = 
Pa 
(21) 
In general, P differs from unity as a consequence of entropy 
differences 
between the minimum and the transition state. Since 
the transition state entropy is usually reduced with respect to 
that of the minimum because of, e.g., restricted rotational 
freedom, P is usually smaller than 1. 
One can estimate (T* 
(or P )  by equating eq 20 with eq 16. 
At a typical reaction temperature (700 K), these equations give 
ro = 
(2.2 x 102)a*[HZ][CD4] 
(22) 
and 
io 
= 
(1.5 x 10-9)[HZ][CD4] 
(23) 
respectively, from which it follows that u* 
is approximately 
6.9 x 
A2 and P, approximately 
Such a value is 
indicative of a so-called loose transition state, for which the 
reduction of rotational and vibrational entropy is relatively 
minor, and does not severely hinder the reaction. 
4. Exchange in the H-Zeolites FAU and MFI 
We now turn to the application of the above results to real 
zeolites, specifically FAU and MFI, and quantify the differ- 
ences between these zeolites in their capacity to exchange acid 
(24)See, e.g., Atkins, P. W .  Physical Chemistry, 4th ed.; Oxford

if we take the difference 
in AySi ratio into account. In his study, 
the author found that the heat of adsorption increases by around 
10% if the AYSi ratio of FAU is lowered from 0.33 to zero. 
Thus for both FAU and MFI, 0.26 eV is the best estimate for 
Q 
A. 
4.1. Influence of Acidity on the Reaction Rate. In a 
previous 
papefi we have estimated 
the proton affinity differences 
between all crystallographically 
different sites in FAU and MFI. 
In order to estimate the effective reaction rate in either of these 
zeolites, we will consider (i) all possible combinations of two 
oxygen sites, (ii) the possible steric hindrance of the exchange, 
and (iii) quantification of the effects of proton affinity differ- 
ences on the reaction rates for those reaction paths that are 
sterically accessible. 
At this 
stage it is useful to introduce the concept of an ideal 
zeolite. As we have seen, the reaction barrier is lowest if the 
proton affinities of the two oxygen sites involved are equal. A 
lower bound to the barrier provides an upper bound to the 
reaction rate. Similarly, exclusion on steric grounds of reaction 
pathways that involve certain pairs of oxygen atoms reduces 
the reaction rate in real zeolites. An ideal zeolite is so defined 
as to suffer as little as possible from steric hindrance. While 
an A104 tetrahedron has six oxygen-oxygen ribs that may 
provide a reaction path, the embedding of the tetrahedron in an 
infinite structure will always cause at least one of these ribs to 
be inside the zeolite framework and therefore to be inacces- 
sible to reactant molecules. Thus, the ideal zeolite is defined 
as having five reaction pathways per aluminum tetrahedron. 
Below, we express the reaction rates of FAU and MFI as 
fractions of the reaction rate in the ideal zeolite. Thereby, 
the ideal zeolite provides a useful reference point for the 
comparison of reaction rates in zeolites with that in the 
molecular model system. 
As we have seen (eq 6), the barrier B is dependent on 
differences in proton energy (8, 
defined as the negative of the 
proton affhity) between oxygen sites j and k

Here, the fist term represents the activation energy from the 
adsorption 
complex (AC) to the transition state and is equivalent 
to Bo, which was introduced in the discussion of the cluster 
calculations (section 2); the second is the adsorption energy, 
QA. Its evaluation requires that we quantify (i) the varying 
acidity of the acid OH groups in real zeolites, which modifies 
ETS - 
EAC, 
and (ii) the adsorption energy. We start with the 
latter. 
It is well known that ab initio quantum chemistry does not 
accurately predict adsorption energies. This is because adsorp- 
tion energies are relatively small as well as being due to van 
der Waals and ionic interactions. The van der Waals interaction 
is neglected at the SCF level, and the long-range character of 
the ionic interactions (with methanes quadrupole moment and 
induced dipole moment) makes its value sensitive to cluster size. 
Hence, we will estimate QA for FAU and MFI from empirical 
data. The adsorption energies of methane in various zeolites 
are known both from experiment25 
and from molecular model- 
The isosteric heat of adsorption is a quantity that depends 
not only on zeolite type but also on pressure (loading) and 
temperature. It should be realized that the temperature- 
dependent-heat of adsorption is actually the free energy of 
adsorption. From its introduction in the preceding section, it 
is evident that QA is the energy of adsorption in an adsorption 
minimum, which equals the isosteric heat of adsorption at zero 
temperature where there are no entropic effects. 
As no low-temperature experimental adsorption data are 
available, we must rely on modeling results. In Figure 7 we 
have reproduced the data from Den O  d e n ,    
showing the 
calculated, temperature-dependent heats of adsorption in FAU 
and MFI. It is seen that the heats of adsorption of FAU and 
MFI extrapolate to similar values. The values are even closer

when proton equilibration 
is fast compared to the D/H 
exchange 
reaction. This is indeed the case; ab initio calculations18 
indicate 
that the barrier for direct proton transfer is approximately 0.5 
eV, which is much lower than the D/H exchange barrier. 
With these definitions, the reaction rate (eq 17) can be 
generalized to describe the effect rate constant in a zeolite with 
different T-sites (numbered I). The reaction rate, or more 
accurately, the rate at which acid hydrogen is replaced by 
deuterium, is an 
average over all T-sites and over all available 
reaction paths, giving 
exp(-G(gk - 
q)/k,T) (28) 
Here, fr is the fraction of crystallographic T-sites that are of 
type I, and j and k run over the oxygen sites of the A 1 0 4  
tetrahedron. The reaction rate expression can be split into a 
zeolite-independent part %(Tj and a zeolite-dependent part 3 ( T )

Vol. 117, No. 6, 1995

Note that %(T) is the rate constant of the "ideal zeolite", and 
F ( 5  
1) is the activity of a particular zeolite relative to that of 
the "ideal zeolite". 
4.1.1. Faujasite. The proton affinities in zeolite FAU have 
been calculated 
previously.6 The four oxygen sites surrounding 
the one unique T-site have proton energies as listed in Table 8. 
Out of the hypothetical six pathways, only the three that involve 
oxygen sites 1,2, and 4 are available for D/H exchange because 
for these positions the proton protrudes into the supercage of 
the faujasite structure. Protons attached to O3 
protrude into the 
small sodalite cage. Although methane cannot pass into this 
cage, construction of a transition state geometry that uses 0 3  
proves sterically impossible. 
In principle this information suffices to calculate the reaction 
rate in FAU. However, since it has a simple crystal structure 
and has been studied extensively over the years, we have 
information about the relative proton population of the oxygen 
sites. X-ray studiesz8 
have revealed that usually sites 1 and 3 
are occupied to a similar extent, whereas, based on a Boltzmann 
distribution between sites that differ by 0.2-0.5 eV in energy 
(Table 8), one would expect at least a 1:lO population ratio 
between them. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the 
notion-from experimental 
work-that the O3 
proton population 
is restricted. O3 
protons of different A104 
tetrahedra would be 
too close together, which restricts the 0
3
 population when the 
aluminum content is significant. Excess protons then populate 
site 1. In the sample used for the D/H exchange experiment, 
one-third of the protons reside on 0 3  
and are inactive; the 
remainder are on the other sites and are responsible for D/H 
exchange. Taking all experimental and theoretical information 
into account we have

estimates for the proton energies of all 48 possible combinations

In addition, we have expressed the relative proton energy in 
terms of the width of the distribution. The width is somewhat 
uncertain but estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.8 eV. The 
data (which were presented in a graph in ref 6) have been 
tabulated in Table 9. 
Steric accessibility of pathways was determined with the help 
of a zeolite visualization package. It was assumed that the 
proton would lie in the TOT plane as spanned by the T-sites 
and 0 atoms of the all-silica framework. Pathways were 
1089.

Taken from the study in ref 6, where the data were presented in 
graphical form. 
assumed to be accessible if the proton positions thus defined 
pointed into the same channel 
region. This method is considered 
to provide a good estimate in all but those few cases where the 
proton position was uncertain, as the TOT angle was close to 
180". 
A total of 45 different sterically accessible pathways were 
identified. For 5 of the 12 crystallographically distinct T-sites 
we counted a maximum of five different paths per T-site. This 
occurs when two faces of the A104 tetrahedron face different 
channels or when two faces are on the edge of the sinusoidal 
channel along the crystallographic c-axis. For one T-site by 
contrast, only one accessible path was found. The accessible 
paths are listed in Table 10. 
One may note from the table that the paths that are 
energetically favorable (Le., between sites of lowest proton 
energy) are invariably sterically forbidden. This is because sites 
of low proton energy tend to lie in the interior of the MFI 
framework rather than on the large pores of the structure. This 
structure-property relationship 
was found in our previous study6 
and is now observed to affect catalytic behavior. 
In the same manner as for FAU, we can calculate % 
by 
averaging over T-sites and over sterically accessible pathways. 
Using values of 0.6 and 0.8 eV for the width of the proton 
affinity distribution-as recommended in our earlier work6-we 
find that &= varies with temperature between 0.054 (350 "C) 
and 0.094 (480 "C), 
and between 0.023 and 0.044, 
respectively.

The results are based on optical inspection of the three-dimensional 
structure. The numbers refer to the structure determination of Olson 
et 
have 
(33) 
as a final result. 
The main source of uncertainty in this predicted activity ratio 
is the uncertainty of proton energies. An independent 
theoretical 
estimate of proton energies in the zeolites FAU and MFI has 
been published by Sauer and c o -  o r k e r s .     
Using their results, 
we find a value for -/&,IJ 
of 4
(
f
2
)
.
 
The somewhat lower 
value reflects the lower spread in proton energies found by these 
authors. 
It is interesting to note that the higher activity of MFI is 
essentially due to the larger number of crystallographically 
independent 
T-sites (12 for MFI vs 1 
for FAU). Figure 8 shows 
the site-dependence of the activity in both zeolites. In FAU 
the one T-site has about average activity, whereas in MFI a 
range of activities is observed, of which the most active 
determine the overall activity. 
5. Comparison with Experiments 
Previously, we presented an outline of the theoretical results 
together with new experimental data to test the prediction. 
Since the focus here is on theory, we will only briefly review 
the comparison with experiment. 
D/H exchange between deuterated methane and H-zeolites 
(Si:Al > 10) was monitored by measuring the time-evolution 
of the infrared adsorption spectrum of a closed container of 
zeolite in contact 
with an excess amount of methane at a constant 
pressure of 13 Torr. Over time, the absorption intensity of the 
stretch vibration of acid OH (IoH) was observed to disappear

(35) 
The decay time z was measured at different temperatures 
between 350 and 480 C. The temperature range is limited on 
the low-temperature side by the experimentalists patience and 
on the high-temperature side by the onset of pyrolysis of 
methane, which can cause interferences at temperatures 
exceed- 
ing 500 C. 
Figure 9 shows the experimentally observed t 
for H-zeolites 
FAU and MFI, together with our predictions from transition 
state theory, as well as the exchange rate for the hypothetical 
ideal zeolite. For the latter, the uncertainty due to the 
inaccuracy of the value for Bi is also indicated. The values at 
experimentally accessible temperatures coincide satisfactorily 
with the theoretical predictions. The large uncertainty in the 
absolute reaction rate does not invalidate our conclusion about 
the much smaller difference between FAU and MFI, since the 
uncertainty in B
E
 affects the predictions for both zeolites 
identically. 
The theoretical comparison between FAU and MFI relies on 
force field estimates for proton affinity differences between 
crystallographically 
distinct sites. The uncertainty of these, and 
(34) 
1776 J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 117, No. 6, 1995 
especially those for MFI, is difficult to assess.6 However, the 
higher activity of MFI, relative to FAU, is a robust result, relying 
essentially only on the difference in the number of crystallo- 
graphically different T-sites and the width of the proton affinity 
distribution. Furthermore, it is consistent with experiments on 
other acid-catalysed reactions that produce the same ordering 
(see, e.g., ref 30). The quantitative analysis of experimental 
exchange activity differences leads to an estimate for the 
differences in proton affinities in zeolites that is between 0.5 
and 1 eV. 
6. Conclusion 
We have studied in detail the D/H exchange reaction between 
deuterated methane and the H-forms of the zeolites FAU (HY) 
and MFI (HZSM-5). The problem was approached from two 
different perspectives. Starting 
from the molecular side, we used 
accurate ab initio calculations to studfy the reaction between

methane and a molecular zeolite cluster. Perturbation of these 
clusters could be used to assess the effects of the heterogeneity 
of proton affinity (acidity) between different sites in a zeolite. 
We then estimated these proton affinity differences for FAU 
and MFI by means of force field calculations on periodic lattices. 
Combining both, we were able to predict both the reaction rate 
itself as well as the difference in reaction rates between these 
two zeolites. It was found that the reaction rate is determined 
by dtrerences in acidity between the two oxygen sites involved 
in the exchange process, and the absolute acidity does not play 
a role. Finally, the theoretical results compare favorably with 
experimental 
data, showing that with present day computational 
capabilities it is possible to shed light on zeolite-catalyzed 
reactions.
