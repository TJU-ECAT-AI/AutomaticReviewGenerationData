Abstract 
Hydrogen removal 
occurs by recombinative desorption and 
by hydrogen 
transfer during dehydrogenation steps required i n  the conversion o f  a1 
kanes 
on H-ZSM5 and on H-ZSM5 modified by G
a
 o r  Zn. 
On H-ZSM5, hydrogen removal 
l i m i t s  the r a t e  o f  propane conversion t o  aromatics. 
The r e s u l t i n g  high 
surface hydrogen 
fugacities lead t o  cracking, 
a step that removes 
both 
adsorbed hydrogen and deactivating residues. 
G
a
 and Zn ions catalyze the 
recombinative desorption o f  H-adatoms, 
lower hydrogen surface fugacities, 
and allow acid sites t o  turnover without cracking. 
Metal ions act as 
"portholes" 
f o r  the 
desorption o f  H-atoms 
as 
Hp. 
I n - s i t u  
EXAFS 
neasurements show 
that Ga+3 
ions reduce during reactions o f  propane 
o r  
pretreatment by Hp. 
Hydrogen desorption and propane aromatization rates 
depend on 
the density o f  reduced G
a
 species i n  H-ZSM5, 
which catalyze 
rate-1 
i m i t i n g  hydrogen removal 
steps. 
The overall c a t a l y t i c  sequence 
i s  
bifunctional ; 
Bronsted acid chemistry i s  apparently enhanced by the pres- 
ence o f  s i t e s  that s t a b i l i z e  hydride ions and catalyze H+-H- 
recombination 
reactions. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A1 kanes react i n  c a t a l y t i c  sequences that often require unsaturated gas 
phase 
and 
surface intermediates. 
The 
required dehydrogenation 
steps 
require C-H bond cleavage and the adsorption o f  hydrogen atoms on neighbor- 
ing sites. 
Recombinative desorption and hydrogen transfer steps that 
remove H-adatoms can l i m i t  rates o f  alkane conversion and lead t o  hydrogen 
surface fugacities 
[1,2] 
that exceed gas 
phase 
pressures 
[3]. 
These 
surface fugacities can be decreased by hydrogen desorption s i t e s  o r  by 
cracking and hydrogenation reactions t h a t  consume H-adatoms [3]. 
Alkane dehydrocyclodimerization on 
H-ZSM5 modified by G
a
 
[4-91 o r  Zn 
[ l o ]  involves dehydrogenation, 
dimerization, 
cyclization, 
and cracking 
steps. Hydrogen removal r a t e - l i m i t i n g  steps were 
f i r s t  proposed on the 
basis o f  k i n e t i c  evidence: propane aromatization rates become dependent 
on 
dihydrogen pressure when Zn ions are placed within H-ZSM5 channels [lo]; G
a
 
appears t o  play a similar r o l e  [8,9]. 
Recently, we 
provided 
isotopic 
tracer evidence f o r  hydrogen removal 
rate-1 
i m i  
t i n g  steps [3] ; we 
also 
showed how the resulting high hydrogen surface fugaci 
t i e s  control hydrogen 
transfer and cracking s e l e c t i v i t y  [3]. 
Here, we describe the nature o f  the 
r a t e - l i m i t i n g  hydrogen desorption steps and 
show that desorption sites 
consist o f  reduced G
a
 species.

2. EXPERIMENTAL 
Propane reactions on H-ZSM5 and on H-ZSM5 modified by G
a
 (2.1 % w t . )  
o r  
Zn (2.8 % wt.) 
were examined by 1% and D isotopic exchange and by 
k i n e t i c  
studies. 
Reactions were carried out i n  a batch reactor [ll]; 
products were 
analyzed by GC, 
GC/MS, 
and 1% 
NMR. 
Ga 
and Zn ions were introduced by 
impregnation o f  H-ZSM5 (Si/A1=14.5) 
with the corresponding n i t r a t e  s a l t .  
The chemical state o f  Ga i n  working catalysts was characterized by G
a
 
K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using EXAFS beamline X l O C  a t  the 
National Synchrotron Light Source. 
The monochromator resolution a t  the G
a
 
K-edge (10368 eV) was 4 eV. 
The i n - s i t u  XAS c e l l  was described previously 
[13J. 
G
a
 K-edges were fit by l i n e a r  combinations o f  spectra from standard 
Ga+ 
compounds and Ga metal. 
The 
resulting best fit gave the f r a c t i o n  o f  
the Ga i n  reduced (0 t o  +1 oxidation) and oxidized (t3) states [14]. 
3. RESULTS/DISCUSSION 
Ga and Zn addition t o  H-ZSM5 
increases the r a t e  and 
s e l e c t i v i t y  o f  
propane conversion t o  aromatics (Table). The f r a c t i o n  o f  H-atoms i n  reacted 
propane t h a t  appears 
as H2 i s  much lower on H-ZSM5 (4%) 
than on H-ZSM5 
modified by G
a
 
(23%) 
o r  Zn 
(29%) 
(Table). 
Thus, 
G
a
 
and Zn 
allow 
dehydrogenation without cracking, 
the predominant pathway 
f o r  H-adatom 
removal on H-ZSM5. 
The i n i t i a l  products o f  propene/propane-2-13C mixtures are unlabelled, 
suggesting t h a t  alkenes are reactive intermediates i n  propane reactions on 
H-ZSM5 and Ga(or Zn)/H-ZSM5 
[15]. G
a
 and Zn 
increase the r a t e  o f  propane 
dehydrogenation t o  propene, 
but they increase the r a t e  o f  subsequent 
propene conversion steps even more. Thus, on G
a
 and Zn samples, the i n i t i a l  
dehydrogenation step becomes t o t a l l y  i r r e v e r s i b l e  and steady-state 
concen- 
t r a t i o n s  o f  propene actually decrease, 
even though 
G
a
 and 
Zn 
increase 
i n i t i a l  dehydrogenation rates. Later steps, which consume propene and which 
require several 
dehydrogenation and H-removal events, 
are affected more 
strongly by Zn and Ga addition than propane dehydrogenation steps. 
A1 1 products o f  propane-2-13C 
(or propene-2-13C) 
reactions on 
H-ZSM5 
contain binomial 1
%
.
 
distributions, even a t  very low conversions 
(Figure 
la). 
Thus, aromatization includes rapid o l  
igomerization-cracking cycles o f  
intermediate alkenes [13]; such cycles cleave and reform every C-C and 
C-H 
bond during one aromatization turnover. 
G
a
 and Zn decrease the residence 
time o f  alkenes w i t h i n  such cycles and lead t o  sharper 13C d i s t r i b u t i o n s  i n  
products (Figure l b ) .  
Alkenes convert 
t o  stable products and acid sites 
turnover more rapidly when dehydrogenation can occur without cracking. 
Cyclization mechanisms 
cannot be 
inferred from 1% 
d i s t r i b u t i o n s  i n  
products o f  propane-2-13C 
because 1% positions become random during 
oligomerization-cracking cycles. As a result, products contain H-atoms that 
have equilibrated w i t h  the H 
surface pool; a l l  products contain binomial 
d h t r i b u t i o n s  o f  D-atoms. 
Therefore, the deuterium content i n  the products 
o f  propane/D2 mixtures r e f l e c t s  the composition o f  the hydrogen surface 
pool, the extent o f  equilibration i n  hydrogen adsorption-desorption steps, 
and the protium surface fugacity generated by dehydrogenation steps. 
O
n
 H-ZSM5, the deuterium content i n  a l l  products i s  similar; it i s  very 
low 
(2-4%, 
Figure 
2), 
suggesting 
that rate-1 
i m i t i n g  
recombinative 
desorption steps 
prevent 
hydrogen adsorption-desorption 
equil 
ibrium. 
H-adatoms are predominantly removed by reaction w i t h  surface hydrocarbon 
fragments, 
and not by recombinative desorption, leading t o  high cracking

The fugacity o f  adsorbed species exceeds t h a t  i n  equilibrium with t 
contacting gas phase when desorption l i m i t s  the r a t e  o f  a c a t a l y t i c  s 
quence. 
This occurs because every step i n  a c a t a l y t i c  sequence must have 
p o s i t i v e  a f f i n i t y ,  regardless o f  the standard a f f i n i t y  o f  each step

Preceeding elementary steps must "pump" adatoms onto t

This surface fugacity provid

Ga ions act as

The deuterium content 
i n  the products increases when Ga o r  ; 
are introduced i n t o  H-ZSM5 (Figure 2). Hydrogen adsorption-desorption stel 
become increasingly reversible (less exergic) and the surface hydrogen poc 
contains a much greater contribution from the (D2) gas phase. 
The 
surfac 
protium fugacities generated by dehydrogenation steps (Ga - 26 kPa; Zn - 1 
kPa) are much lower than on H-ZSM5 (250 kPa), 
but s t i l l  exceed gas

Ga/H-ZSM5, 
both rates and s e l e c t i v i t

they decrease as

t u  EXAFS measurements show t h a t  Gat3 ions exchanged i n t o  H-ZSM!

during propane reaction5 
(Figure 3 ) ;  t h i s  reduced form o f  Ga provides hydrogen desorption s i t e s  that 
remove H-atoms as ti2 during propane conversion on Ga/H-ZSM5. The 
reduction 
o f  Gat3 species during hydrogen pretreatment and propane reactions 
(Figure

aromatic 
s e l e c t i v i t y  and w i t h  the appearance o f  H p  among products. Clearly, 
reduced 
Ga species allow conversion t o  occur with H-removal 
by recombinative 
desorption. 
Propane aromatization r a t e  and s e l e c t i v i t y ,  deuterium content

p a r t i a l l y  relieved by these reduced Ga sites. 
Gat3 species i n  tetrahedral 
framework positions do not catalyze H-desorption o r  propane 
aromatization 
reactions. Apparently, non-framework G
a
 and Zn species act as Lewis acids 
and s t a b i l i z e  H- 
species; these active centers allow Ht-H- 
recombination 
and the heterolytic dissociation o f  H2. 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
G
a
 and Zn species i n  H-ZSM5 catalyze the recombinative desorption o f  
H-adatoms and lower hydrogen 
surface fugaci 
t i e s  during propane conversion 
t o  aromatics. 
H-removal 
as H2 
allows acid s i t e s  t o  turnover without 
concurrent cracking. 
Thus, propane conversion rates and aromatics selec- 
t i v i t y  increase when G
a
 o r  Zn are introduced i n t o  non-framework positions 
i n  H-ZSM5. G
a
 and Zn also decrease the residence time o f  reactive interme- 
diates by providing a more effective pathway f o r  acid s i t e  turnover. 
Hydrogen desorption rates depend on 
the density o f  reduced G
a
 
sites, 
measured by XAS studies during reaction. 
Hydrogen surface fugaci t i e s  and desorption 
sites control hydrogen 
transfer catalysis on H-ZSM5. 
A1 kane dehydrogenation 
leads t o  reactive 
hydrogen species that transfer from a high fugacity pool t o  hydrocarbon 
surface species, 
without requiring d i r e c t  bimolecular 
elementary 
steps 
between adsorbed hydrocarbons. 
Surface fugaci 
ty concepts may a1 
so 
explain 
the reduction o f  NO with l i g h t  alkanes on H-ZSM5 [17]. 
Hydrogen desorption 
sites introduced bv Lewis acid centers may account f o r  the enhanced a c t i v i -
