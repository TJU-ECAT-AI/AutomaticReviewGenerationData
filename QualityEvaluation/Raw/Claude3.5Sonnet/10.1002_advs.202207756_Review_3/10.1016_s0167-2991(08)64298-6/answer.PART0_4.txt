[1] "Ga ions act as "portholes" [16] for desorption of H-adatoms and for its reverse - the introduction of D-atoms in the products of propane/D2 mixtures."

[2] "In-situ EXAFS measurements show that Ga+3 ions exchanged into H-ZSM5 are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and during propane reactions (Figure 3); this reduced form of Ga provides hydrogen desorption sites that remove H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion on Ga/H-ZSM5."

[3] "Propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity increase as the density of reduced Ga atoms increases (Table)."

[4] "Apparently, non-framework Ga and Zn species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species; these active centers allow H+-H- recombination and the heterolytic dissociation of H2."

The literature does not provide specific information about the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, or framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 

However, the document does reveal some insights about the active gallium species and their role in the catalyst:

1. Reduced gallium species act as hydrogen desorption sites, facilitating the removal of H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion.

2. The density of reduced gallium atoms correlates positively with propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity.

3. Non-framework gallium species function as Lewis acids, stabilizing H- species and enabling H+-H- recombination and heterolytic dissociation of H2.

4. Ga3+ ions in the zeolite framework can be reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and propane reactions, forming the active reduced gallium species.

These findings suggest that the activity of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is closely linked to the presence and quantity of reduced, non-framework gallium species. However, the document does not provide specific information on how the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, or framework aluminum pair density influence these active species or the catalyst's structure-activity correlations.

该文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例或骨架铝原子对密度对镓改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质的影响的具体信息，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中。

然而，该文档确实揭示了一些关于活性镓物种及其在催化剂中的作用的见解：

1. 还原态的镓物种作为氢脱附位点，促进了丙烷转化过程中H原子以H2形式的脱除。

2. 还原态镓原子的密度与丙烷芳构化速率和选择性、产物中的氘含量以及H2选择性呈正相关。

3. 非骨架镓物种作为路易斯酸，稳定H-物种，并促进H+-H-重组和H2的异裂解离。

4. 沸石骨架中的Ga3+离子可在氢气预处理和丙烷反应过程中被还原，形成活性还原态镓物种。

这些发现表明，镓改性沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的活性与还原态、非骨架镓物种的存在和数量密切相关。然而，该文档并未提供关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例或骨架铝原子对密度如何影响这些活性物种或催化剂的结构-活性关系的具体信息。
