[1] "Ga ions act as "portholes" [16] for desorption of H-adatoms and for its reverse - the introduction of D-atoms in the products of propane/D2 mixtures."

[2] "In-situ EXAFS measurements show that Ga+3 ions exchanged into H-ZSM5 are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and during propane reactions (Figure 3); this reduced form of Ga provides hydrogen desorption sites that remove H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion on Ga/H-ZSM5."

[3] "Propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity increase as the density of reduced Ga atoms increases (Table)."

[4] "Apparently, non-framework Ga and Zn species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species; these active centers allow H+-H- recombination and the heterolytic dissociation of H2."

The literature does not provide specific information about the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, or framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 

However, the document does describe some important aspects of the active gallium species:

1. Reduced gallium species act as hydrogen desorption sites, facilitating the removal of H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion.

2. The density of reduced gallium atoms correlates positively with propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity.

3. Non-framework gallium species function as Lewis acids, stabilizing H- species and enabling H+-H- recombination and heterolytic dissociation of H2.

These findings suggest that the catalyst's activity in propane dehydrogenation is related to the presence and density of reduced, non-framework gallium species. However, without specific information on how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density affect these active species, it's not possible to draw definitive conclusions about structure-activity correlations based solely on this literature.

该文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例或骨架铝对分布密度对Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质的影响的具体信息,也没有说明这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中如何反映催化剂的结构-活性相关性。

然而,该文档确实描述了活性镓物种的一些重要方面:

1. 还原态的镓物种充当氢脱附位点,促进丙烷转化过程中H原子以H2形式脱除。

2. 还原态镓原子的密度与丙烷芳构化速率和选择性、产物中的氘含量以及H2选择性呈正相关。

3. 非骨架镓物种作为Lewis酸,稳定H-物种,并实现H+-H-重组和H2的异裂解离。

这些发现表明,催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的活性与还原态非骨架镓物种的存在和密度有关。然而,由于缺乏Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对分布密度如何影响这些活性物种的具体信息,仅根据这篇文献无法得出关于结构-活性相关性的明确结论。
