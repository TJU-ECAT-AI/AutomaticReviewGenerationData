[1] "Ga ions act as "portholes" [16] for desorption of H-adatoms and for its reverse - the introduction of D-atoms in the products of propane/D2 mixtures."

[2] "In-situ EXAFS measurements show that Ga+3 ions exchanged into H-ZSM5 are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and during propane reactions (Figure 3); this reduced form of Ga provides hydrogen desorption sites that remove H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion on Ga/H-ZSM5."

[3] "Propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity increase as the density of reduced Ga atoms increases (Table)."

[4] "Apparently, non-framework Ga and Zn species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species; these active centers allow H+-H- recombination and the heterolytic dissociation of H2."

The literature does not provide specific information about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the nature and role of active gallium species:

1. Gallium ions in H-ZSM5 act as "portholes" for hydrogen adsorption and desorption.

2. Ga+3 ions exchanged into H-ZSM5 are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and propane reactions, forming the active sites for hydrogen desorption.

3. The density of reduced gallium atoms correlates positively with propane aromatization rate, selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity.

4. Non-framework gallium species act as Lewis acids, stabilizing H- species and enabling H+-H- recombination and heterolytic H2 dissociation.

These findings suggest that the active gallium species are likely reduced, non-framework gallium atoms that function as Lewis acid sites. However, the document does not explicitly discuss the relationships between Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, or framework aluminum pair density and the formation or nature of these active species. More specific research would be needed to establish these structure-activity correlations.

该文献并未提供关于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝原子对密度如何影响Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质的具体信息。然而，它确实提供了一些关于活性镓物种的性质和作用的见解：

1. H-ZSM5中的镓离子充当氢吸附和脱附的"窗口"。

2. 在氢气预处理和丙烷反应过程中，交换到H-ZSM5中的Ga+3离子被还原，形成氢脱附的活性位点。

3. 还原态镓原子的密度与丙烷芳构化速率、选择性、产物中的氘含量和H2选择性呈正相关。

4. 非骨架镓物种作为Lewis酸，稳定H-物种，并促进H+-H-重组和H2的异裂解离。

这些发现表明，活性镓物种可能是还原态的、非骨架镓原子，它们作为Lewis酸位点发挥作用。然而，该文档并未明确讨论Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率或骨架铝原子对密度与这些活性物种的形成或性质之间的关系。需要进行更具体的研究来建立这些结构-活性相关性。
