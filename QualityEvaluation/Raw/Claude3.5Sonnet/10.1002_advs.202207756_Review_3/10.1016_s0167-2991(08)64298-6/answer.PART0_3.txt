[1] "Ga and Zn addition to H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of propane conversion to aromatics (Table)."

[2] "Ga ions act as "portholes" [16] for desorption of H-adatoms and for its reverse - the introduction of D-atoms in the products of propane/D2 mixtures."

[3] "In-situ EXAFS measurements show that Ga+3 ions exchanged into H-ZSM5 are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and during propane reactions (Figure 3); this reduced form of Ga provides hydrogen desorption sites that remove H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion on Ga/H-ZSM5."

[4] "Propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity increase as the density of reduced Ga atoms increases (Table)."

[5] "Ga+3 species in tetrahedral framework positions do not catalyze H-desorption or propane aromatization reactions. Apparently, non-framework Ga and Zn species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species; these active centers allow H+-H- recombination and the heterolytic dissociation of H2."

The literature does not provide specific information about the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. However, it does offer some insights into the structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. The addition of Ga to H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of propane conversion to aromatics.

2. Reduced Ga species, formed during hydrogen pretreatment and propane reactions, provide hydrogen desorption sites that remove H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion.

3. The density of reduced Ga atoms positively correlates with propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity.

4. Non-framework Ga species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species, allowing H+-H- recombination and heterolytic dissociation of H2.

5. Ga+3 species in tetrahedral framework positions do not catalyze H-desorption or propane aromatization reactions, suggesting that the active species are non-framework Ga.

These observations indicate that the formation of reduced, non-framework Ga species is crucial for catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, the specific relationships between Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density and the formation of these active species are not directly addressed in the given literature.

虽然文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对形成活性镓物种的具体影响信息，但它确实提供了一些关于丙烷脱氢反应中结构-活性相关性的见解：

1. 向H-ZSM5中添加Ga可以提高丙烷转化为芳烃的速率和选择性。

2. 在氢预处理和丙烷反应过程中形成的还原态Ga物种，提供了氢脱附位点，在丙烷转化过程中以H2的形式去除H原子。

3. 还原态Ga原子的密度与丙烷芳构化速率和选择性、产物中的氘含量以及H2选择性呈正相关。

4. 非骨架Ga物种作为Lewis酸，可以稳定H-物种，允许H+-H-重组和H2的异裂解离。

5. 四面体骨架位置的Ga+3物种不能催化H脱附或丙烷芳构化反应，这表明活性物种是非骨架Ga。

这些观察结果表明，还原态非骨架Ga物种的形成对丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性至关重要。然而，给定的文献并未直接讨论Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度与这些活性物种形成之间的具体关系。
