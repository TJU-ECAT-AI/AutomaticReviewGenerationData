[1] "A detailed study of the sites of bivalent cations has shown a preference for the occurrence of Al pairs in the ring structures of ZSM-5 zeolite for Si/Al ratios up to 22."

          [2] "EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data, we note that the computations have been carried out for one specific ring structure."

          [3] "Ga/ZSM-5 was prepared according to reference8. In Ga/ZSM-5 the Brnsted protons have been quantitatively replaced by Ga+ ions."

[1] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeolite."

[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."

[3] "The intensity of the GaH2 increases almost linearly at low Ga loadings, levels off when the Ga/Al ratio exceeds 0.1, and declines slowly with the increase of the Ga/Al ratio above 0.56"

[4] "The lack of GaHx spectral features on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratio as high as 1.3 strongly indicates that these isolated Ga+ sites cannot form stable GaHx species at 550 C"

[5] "We propose that the Ga+H+ pair sites formed by exchanging Ga+ with one of the paired BAS is the species capable of forming GaHx species based on the spectroscopic observation"

[6] "The drastically different properties of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 upon reaction with H2 at 550 C and water at 150 C strongly suggest the possibility that they could have different catalytic properties in the PDH."

[7] "Zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios, or higher Al contents, have higher densities of paired BAS assuming Al is distributed uniformly across the zeolite framework."

[8] "Ga speciation in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[9] "Ga+ preferentially exchanges with single protons in paired BAS sites over protons in isolated BAS, to form Ga+H+ pair sites on samples with low Si/Al ratios. Mainly isolated Ga+ exchanged with isolated BAS are produced on samples with a high Si/Al ratio."

[10] "Spectral features of GaHx observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples at 550 C show that Ga hydrides can only form on Ga+H+ pair sites, rather than isolated Ga+ sites"

[1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+2 sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

[3] "Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 → 4). The calculated reaction energy of ΔE = −62 kJ/mol is lower than that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on isolated gallyl ion in II (ΔE = −258 kJ/mol), while the difference in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Table 1)."

[4] "The important question here is whether proximate Al substitutions in the zeolite framework are necessary to stabilize these binuclear cationic species."

[5] "Formation of two isolated gallyl ions in a single side-pocket of MOR (1) requires a slightly unfavorable coordination of one of the GaO+ cations to the zeolite wall."

[1] "The atomic Si/A1 ratio in the Zeochem material was 14.5. This value remained constant throughout all exchange procedures and thermal treatments of the samples."

[2] "The Ga/H-ZSM5 sample was measured to have a Ga content of 2.1 wt% (Ga/A1 = 0.29)."

[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[4] "Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. Ion exchange occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at 700-800 K via vapor phase exchange of volatile Ga1+ species."

[5] "Ga species increase markedly the rate of propane conversion to propene. For example, the rate of propane conversion (to all products) (Fig. 20) increases by a factor of 7, while the rate of propene conversion (to all products) (Fig. 21) increases by a factor of 4 when Ga is added to H-ZSM5."

[1] "Ga ions act as "portholes" [16] for desorption of H-adatoms and for its reverse - the introduction of D-atoms in the products of propane/D2 mixtures."

[2] "In-situ EXAFS measurements show that Ga+3 ions exchanged into H-ZSM5 are reduced during hydrogen pretreatment and during propane reactions (Figure 3); this reduced form of Ga provides hydrogen desorption sites that remove H-atoms as H2 during propane conversion on Ga/H-ZSM5."

[3] "Propane aromatization rate and selectivity, deuterium content in products, and H2 selectivity increase as the density of reduced Ga atoms increases (Table)."

[4] "Apparently, non-framework Ga and Zn species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species; these active centers allow H+-H- recombination and the heterolytic dissociation of H2."

[5] "Ga+3 species in tetrahedral framework positions do not catalyze H-desorption or propane aromatization reactions. Apparently, non-framework Ga and Zn species act as Lewis acids and stabilize H- species; these active centers allow H+-H- recombination and the heterolytic dissociation of H2."

[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

[2] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[3] "Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."

[4] "On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."

[5] "It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[6] "The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."

[7] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species"
