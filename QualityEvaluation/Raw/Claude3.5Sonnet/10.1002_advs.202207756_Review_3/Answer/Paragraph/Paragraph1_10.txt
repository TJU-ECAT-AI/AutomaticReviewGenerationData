The intricate relationship between gallium species, zeolite composition, and framework aluminum pairs plays a crucial role in determining the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity and overall performance of Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. The incorporation of gallium into zeolite structures enhances their catalytic properties, particularly for PDH reactions. The nature and distribution of gallium species within the zeolite framework significantly influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Zeolite composition, including Si/Al ratio and pore structure, affects the dispersion and stability of gallium species. Furthermore, the presence and arrangement of framework aluminum pairs create specific sites for gallium incorporation, impacting the formation of active centers. These factors collectively contribute to the catalyst's ability to activate propane molecules, facilitate hydrogen transfer, and promote the formation of propylene. Understanding and optimizing this complex interplay is essential for developing highly efficient and stable Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation processes in the petrochemical industry.
