[1] "A detailed study of the sites of bivalent cations has shown a preference for the occurrence of Al pairs in the ring structures of ZSM-5 zeolite for Si/Al ratios up to 22."

[2] "EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data, we note that the computations have been carried out for one specific ring structure."

[3] "Ga/ZSM-5 was prepared according to reference8. In Ga/ZSM-5 the Brnsted protons have been quantitatively replaced by Ga+ ions."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density specifically influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 

However, the text does mention that for ZSM-5 zeolites with Si/Al ratios up to 22, there is a preference for aluminum pairs in the ring structures. This suggests that lower Si/Al ratios may promote the formation of aluminum pairs, which could potentially serve as anchoring sites for binuclear gallium species.

The study focused on a Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst where Brønsted protons were quantitatively replaced by Ga+ ions, indicating a 1:1 Ga/Al ratio. The formation of binuclear gallium species was observed in this case, but the impact of varying Ga/Al ratios was not discussed.

The literature does not provide specific information on how these parameters affect the formation of gallium hydrides or detailed structure-activity correlations. More comprehensive studies would be needed to fully understand these relationships in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

文献中没有提供关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对形成在镓改性沸石催化剂中的活性镓物种的性质的具体影响的详细信息，也没有这些参数在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化剂结构-活性相关性的具体信息。

然而，文中提到对于Si/Al比例高达22的ZSM-5沸石，其环状结构中倾向于形成铝对。这表明较低的Si/Al比可能促进铝对的形成，这些铝对可能成为双核镓物种的锚定位点。

研究focused在一种Ga/ZSM-5催化剂上，其中Brønsted质子被定量替换为Ga+离子，表明Ga/Al比为1:1。在这种情况下观察到了双核镓物种的形成，但文中没有讨论改变Ga/Al比的影响。

文献没有提供这些参数如何影响镓氢化物的形成或详细的结构-活性相关性的具体信息。需要更全面的研究来充分理解这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中的作用。
