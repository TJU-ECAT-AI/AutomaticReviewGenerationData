[1] "A detailed study of the sites of bivalent cations has shown a preference for the occurrence of Al pairs in the ring structures of ZSM-5 zeolite for Si/Al ratios up to 22."

[2] "EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data, we note that the computations have been carried out for one specific ring structure."

[3] "Ga/ZSM-5 was prepared according to reference8. In Ga/ZSM-5 the Brnsted protons have been quantitatively replaced by Ga+ ions."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 

However, the text does mention that for ZSM-5 zeolites with Si/Al ratios up to 22, there is a preference for aluminum pairs in the ring structures. This suggests that lower Si/Al ratios may favor the formation of binuclear gallium species, which are proposed as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of water.

The document states that in the prepared Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst, Brønsted protons were quantitatively replaced by Ga+ ions, indicating a Ga/Al ratio close to 1. This complete ion exchange likely promotes the formation of gallium species that can interact with framework aluminum sites.

The study focuses on the formation of binuclear gallium species in the presence of water, rather than gallium hydrides. The structure-activity correlations are primarily discussed in terms of these binuclear species facilitating hydrogen recombination and thus enhancing propane dehydrogenation activity.

Overall, while the document provides some insights into the nature of active gallium species and their formation, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of how varying Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios affect catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

文献并未提供关于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对形成在镓改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的性质的全面影响信息，也未详细说明这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中对催化剂结构-活性相关性的揭示。

然而，文中提到对于Si/Al比率高达22的ZSM-5沸石，其环状结构中倾向于形成铝对。这表明较低的Si/Al比可能有利于形成双核镓物种，这些物种被认为是在水存在条件下丙烷脱氢的活性位点。

文档指出，在制备的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂中，Brønsted质子被Ga+离子定量取代，表明Ga/Al比接近1。这种完全的离子交换可能促进了能与骨架铝位点相互作用的镓物种的形成。

研究主要集中在水存在条件下双核镓物种的形成，而非镓氢化物。结构-活性相关性主要从这些双核物种促进氢气重组并因此增强丙烷脱氢活性的角度进行讨论。

总的来说，虽然文档提供了一些关于活性镓物种的性质及其形成的见解，但并未对Ga/Al和Si/Al比率的变化如何影响催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能提供全面分析。
