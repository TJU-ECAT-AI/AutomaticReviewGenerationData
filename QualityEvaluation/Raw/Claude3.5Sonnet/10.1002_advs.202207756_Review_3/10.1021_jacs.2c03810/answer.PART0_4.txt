Unfortunately, I do not have enough relevant information from the given literature excerpt to provide meaningful quotes or answers to the question about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence gallium species formation and catalyst activity in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The provided text appears to be only a partial title and author list for a scientific article, without any details about the catalyst properties or reaction results. Without access to the full text of the article, I cannot extract relevant quotes or synthesize an evidence-based answer to the specific question posed.

There is insufficient information provided in the given literature excerpt to answer the question about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, or what these relationships reveal about the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The text only contains partial bibliographic information for a scientific article, without any details about catalyst properties, characterization, or reaction results. A full text of the article would be needed to properly address this question.

给出的文献摘录中没有足够的信息来回答关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度如何影响活性镓物种(包括镓氢化物)的形成和性质的问题,也无法说明这些关系揭示了催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性。文本仅包含一篇科学文章的部分参考文献信息,没有任何关于催化剂性质、表征或反应结果的详细信息。需要该文章的全文才能正确回答这个问题。
