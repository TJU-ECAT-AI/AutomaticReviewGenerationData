[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

[2] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[3] "Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."

[4] "On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."

[5] "It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts have significant influences on the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Ga/Al ratio: The intensity of the GaHx band, indicative of gallium hydride formation, initially increases with Ga loading, reaches a maximum around a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1, and then declines at higher ratios. This suggests an optimal Ga loading for gallium hydride formation.

2. Framework Al pair density: There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx formed, indicating that framework Al pairs play a crucial role in stabilizing the precursors of gallium hydrides.

3. Si/Al ratio: The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework Al pairs, which in turn influences the formation of active gallium species. Lower Si/Al ratios generally lead to higher framework Al pair densities and thus more opportunities for active gallium species formation.

4. Types of gallium species: Three types of gallium species are present in reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The distribution of these species is influenced by the Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios.

5. Catalytic activity: The turnover frequency (TOF) for PDH reactions shows a complex dependence on both Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios. Initially, TOF increases rapidly with Ga loading, then more slowly, and finally declines at higher Ga/Al ratios. This trend suggests an optimal Ga loading for maximum catalytic activity.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are intricate and dependent on multiple factors. The optimal performance is achieved through a delicate balance of Ga loading, framework Al pair density, and Si/Al ratio, which together determine the nature and distribution of active gallium species.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有重要影响，揭示了在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中催化剂的结构-活性相关性：

1. Ga/Al比例：GaHx带的强度（表示镓氢化物的形成）最初随Ga负载量增加而增加，在Ga/Al比例约为0.1时达到最大值，然后在更高比例下降低。这表明存在最佳的Ga负载量以形成镓氢化物。

2. 骨架铝对密度：骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx量之间存在线性相关关系，表明骨架铝对在稳定镓氢化物前体方面起着关键作用。

3. Si/Al比例：Si/Al比例影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响活性镓物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比例通常导致更高的骨架铝对密度，从而为活性镓物种的形成提供更多机会。

4. 镓物种类型：还原后的催化剂中存在三种镓物种：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚体。这些物种的分布受Ga/Al和Si/Al比例的影响。

5. 催化活性：PDH反应的转化频率（TOF）对Ga/Al和Si/Al比例都有复杂的依赖关系。最初，TOF随Ga负载量快速增加，然后增长速度减缓，最后在更高的Ga/Al比例下降低。这一趋势表明存在最佳的Ga负载量以获得最大催化活性。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性是复杂的，依赖于多个因素。通过精细平衡Ga负载量、骨架铝对密度和Si/Al比例，可以获得最佳性能，这些因素共同决定了活性镓物种的性质和分布。
