[1] "As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."

[2] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

[3] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[4] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."

[5] "It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[6] "Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110]"

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework aluminum pairs, which in turn influences the formation of gallium species. Lower Si/Al ratios result in higher densities of framework Al pairs, allowing for more exchanged cations and potentially more active gallium sites.

The Ga/Al ratio impacts the formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx). As the Ga loading increases, the GaHx band intensity initially rises, reaches a maximum, and then declines at higher Ga/Al ratios. This suggests an optimal Ga/Al ratio for forming GaHx species.

There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx formed, indicating that framework Al pairs play a crucial role in stabilizing the precursors of GaHx species. These precursors are likely divalent cationic species, such as Ga2O22+.

The PDH rate depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, highlighting the complex interplay between zeolite composition and gallium loading in determining catalyst activity. The most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is identified as Ga2O22+.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are closely tied to the zeolite's composition and the nature of the gallium species formed. Optimizing the Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios is crucial for maximizing the formation of active gallium species and achieving high PDH performance.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有显著影响，揭示了在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中重要的结构-活性相关性。

Si/Al比例影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响镓物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比例导致较高的骨架铝对密度，允许更多的交换阳离子和潜在的更多活性镓位点。

Ga/Al比例影响镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成。随着Ga负载量的增加，GaHx带的强度最初上升，达到最大值，然后在较高的Ga/Al比例下下降。这表明存在一个形成GaHx物种的最佳Ga/Al比例。

骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx量之间存在线性相关性，表明骨架铝对在稳定GaHx物种前体方面起着关键作用。这些前体可能是二价阳离子物种，如Ga2O22+。

PDH速率同时依赖于Si/Al和Ga/Al比例，凸显了沸石组成和镓负载量在决定催化剂活性方面的复杂相互作用。在Ga/H-ZSM-5上，最活跃的PDH物种被确定为Ga2O22+。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性与沸石的组成和形成的镓物种的性质密切相关。优化Si/Al和Ga/Al比例对于最大化活性镓物种的形成和实现高PDH性能至关重要。
