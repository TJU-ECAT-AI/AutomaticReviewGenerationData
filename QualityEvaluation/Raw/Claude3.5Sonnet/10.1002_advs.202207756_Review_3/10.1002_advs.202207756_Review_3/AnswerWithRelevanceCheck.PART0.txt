          [1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

[2] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[3] "Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."

[4] "On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."

[5] "It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[6] "The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."

[7] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species"

[8] "Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110]"

          The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Ga/Al ratio: The intensity of the GaHx band initially increases with Ga loading, reaches a maximum at a Ga/Al ratio of about 0.1, and then declines at higher ratios. This indicates an optimal Ga loading for GaHx formation.

2. Framework Al pair density: There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx formed. Framework Al pairs are crucial for stabilizing the precursor of GaHx, which is likely a divalent cationic species.

3. Si/Al ratio: The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework Al pairs, which in turn influences the formation of gallium species. Lower Si/Al ratios generally lead to higher framework Al pair densities, potentially allowing for more active gallium sites.

4. Types of gallium species: Three types of Ga species are present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. Among these, Ga2O22+ is identified as the most active species for PDH.

5. Catalytic activity: The PDH rate depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. The turnover frequency (TOF) shows a complex dependence on the Ga/Al ratio, initially increasing rapidly at low Ga loadings, then more slowly, and finally declining at higher Ga/Al ratios.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are intricate and dependent on multiple factors. The optimal performance is achieved through a delicate balance of Ga loading, framework Al pair density, and Si/Al ratio, which together determine the nature and distribution of active gallium species, particularly GaHx and Ga2O22+.

          Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中显著影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物，揭示了丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. Ga/Al比例：GaHx带的强度最初随Ga负载量增加而增加，在Ga/Al比例约为0.1时达到最大值，然后在更高比例下降低。这表明存在形成GaHx的最佳Ga负载量。

2. 骨架铝对密度：骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx数量之间存在线性相关关系。骨架铝对对于稳定GaHx前体（可能是二价阳离子物种）至关重要。

3. Si/Al比例：Si/Al比例影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响镓物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比例通常导致更高的骨架铝对密度，可能允许形成更多的活性镓位点。

4. 镓物种类型：还原后的催化剂中存在三种类型的Ga物种：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚体。其中，Ga2O22+被确定为PDH最活跃的物种。

5. 催化活性：PDH速率同时依赖于Si/Al和Ga/Al比例。转化频率（TOF）显示出与Ga/Al比例的复杂依赖关系，在低Ga负载时快速增加，然后增长较慢，最后在更高的Ga/Al比例下降低。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性是复杂的，依赖于多个因素。通过精细平衡Ga负载量、骨架铝对密度和Si/Al比例，可以获得最佳性能，这些因素共同决定了活性镓物种（特别是GaHx和Ga2O22+）的性质和分布。
