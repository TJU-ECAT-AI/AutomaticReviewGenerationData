[1] "As expected, the amount of exchanged Co2+ decreased for increasing Si/Al ratios of the zeolites (Figure 7b), with the Co2+ exchanged in H-ZSM-5 (39) barely above the detection limit."

[2] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

[3] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[4] "Ga2O22+ is the most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5.[54, 55, 110] Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."

[5] "On Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), the TOF normalized to the amount of Al in the zeolite (TOFAl), increased rapidly at low Ga loadings up to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.05 and then grows more slowly as the Ga/Al ratio rises to 0.3, before declining as the Ga/Al ratio increased further (Figure 9a)."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework aluminum pairs, which in turn influences the formation of gallium species. Lower Si/Al ratios result in higher framework Al pair densities, allowing for more exchanged Co2+ and, by extension, more potential sites for Ga species formation.

2. The Ga/Al ratio has a complex relationship with the formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx). The intensity of the GaHx band initially increases with Ga loading, reaches a maximum at a Ga/Al ratio of about 0.1, and then declines at higher ratios. This suggests an optimal Ga loading for GaHx formation.

3. There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx formed, indicating that framework Al pairs play a crucial role in stabilizing the precursors to GaHx species.

4. Three types of Ga species are present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. Among these, Ga2O22+ is identified as the most active species for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

5. The catalytic activity, measured as turnover frequency (TOF), shows a complex dependence on the Ga/Al ratio. For Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), TOF increases rapidly at low Ga loadings, then more slowly, and finally declines at higher Ga/Al ratios. This trend suggests an optimal Ga loading for maximum catalytic activity.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are highly dependent on the interplay between Ga loading, zeolite composition, and the resulting Ga species formed. Optimizing these parameters is crucial for developing highly active and selective PDH catalysts.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度在镓改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有显著影响，揭示了丙烷脱氢反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. Si/Al比率影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响镓物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比率导致更高的骨架铝对密度，允许更多的Co2+交换，从而提供更多潜在的镓物种形成位点。

2. Ga/Al比率与镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成有复杂的关系。GaHx带的强度最初随镓负载量增加而增加，在Ga/Al比率约为0.1时达到最大值，然后在更高比率下降低。这表明存在最佳的镓负载量以形成GaHx。

3. 骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx量之间存在线性相关，表明骨架铝对在稳定GaHx物种前体方面起着关键作用。

4. 还原后的催化剂上存在三种类型的镓物种：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚体。其中，Ga2O22+被确定为丙烷脱氢（PDH）最活跃的物种。

5. 催化活性（以转化频率TOF衡量）显示出与Ga/Al比率的复杂依赖关系。对于Ga/H-ZSM-5（15，Y），TOF在低镓负载时快速增加，然后增长较慢，最后在更高的Ga/Al比率下降低。这一趋势表明存在最佳的镓负载量以获得最大催化活性。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性高度依赖于镓负载量、沸石组成以及由此形成的镓物种之间的相互作用。优化这些参数对开发高活性和高选择性的PDH催化剂至关重要。
