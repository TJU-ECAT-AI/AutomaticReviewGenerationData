[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

[2] "A similar observation was made on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y), but with a lower maximum GaHx band intensity than that of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y)."

[3] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[4] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species (Figure 7g)."

[5] "It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

[6] "On samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the slope of the TOFAl versus Ga/Al ratio at Ga/Al ratios below 0.042 was 0.60  0.09 molC3H8 molGa1 s1 (Figure 9b). TOFGa decreased to 0.04  0.01 in the Ga/Al ratio range of 0.042 to 0.21, smaller than that in the lower Ga/Al range by a factor of 15, confirming two Ga sites with distinct PDH activities."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is directly related to the Ga/Al ratio. As the Ga loading increases, the GaHx band intensity initially rises, reaches a maximum at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1, and then declines at higher ratios. This trend suggests an optimal Ga loading for forming GaHx species.

The Si/Al ratio affects the maximum intensity of the GaHx band. Lower Si/Al ratios (e.g., 15) result in higher maximum GaHx band intensities compared to higher Si/Al ratios (e.g., 28). This indicates that zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios can accommodate more GaHx species.

Framework aluminum pair density shows a linear correlation with the amount of GaHx formed. This relationship suggests that framework Al pairs are crucial for stabilizing the precursor of GaHx, which is likely a divalent cationic species.

The catalytic activity in PDH reactions, measured by turnover frequency (TOF), depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. For example, in samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the TOF varies significantly with Ga/Al ratio, revealing the presence of two distinct types of Ga sites with different PDH activities.

These relationships demonstrate that the zeolite framework composition (Si/Al ratio) and Ga loading (Ga/Al ratio) play crucial roles in determining the nature and quantity of active Ga species. The framework Al pair density is particularly important for the formation of specific active sites like GaHx. Together, these factors contribute to the complex structure-activity correlations observed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing both zeolite composition and Ga loading to achieve desired catalytic performance.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中显著影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物，揭示了丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中重要的结构-活性相关性。

镓氢化物(GaHx)的形成与Ga/Al比率直接相关。随着Ga负载量的增加，GaHx带强度最初上升，在Ga/Al比率为0.1时达到最大值，然后在更高比率下下降。这一趋势表明存在形成GaHx物种的最佳Ga负载量。

Si/Al比率影响GaHx带的最大强度。较低的Si/Al比率（如15）导致较高的最大GaHx带强度，相比之下较高的Si/Al比率（如28）则较低。这表明具有较低Si/Al比率的沸石可以容纳更多的GaHx物种。

骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx数量呈线性相关。这种关系表明，骨架Al对对于稳定GaHx前体（可能是二价阳离子物种）至关重要。

PDH反应中的催化活性，以转化频率(TOF)衡量，取决于Si/Al和Ga/Al比率。例如，在Si/Al比率为15的样品中，TOF随Ga/Al比率显著变化，揭示了存在两种具有不同PDH活性的不同类型的Ga位点。

这些关系表明，沸石骨架组成（Si/Al比率）和Ga负载量（Ga/Al比率）在决定活性Ga物种的性质和数量方面起着关键作用。骨架Al对密度对于形成特定活性位点（如GaHx）尤为重要。这些因素共同构成了Ga改性沸石催化剂在PDH反应中观察到的复杂结构-活性相关性，强调了优化沸石组成和Ga负载量以实现所需催化性能的重要性。
