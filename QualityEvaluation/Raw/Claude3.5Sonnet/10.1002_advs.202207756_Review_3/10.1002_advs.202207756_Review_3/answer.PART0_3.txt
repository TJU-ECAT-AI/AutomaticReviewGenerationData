[1] "The density of framework Al pairs can be titrated by Co2+ cations because only two adjacent framework negative charges can balance the divalent cation."

[2] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56"

[3] "Ratios between the maximum integrated area of the GaHx peak and the UVvis band corresponding to Co2+ are identical within experimental errors on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28, Y) (Figure 7d), displaying a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx."

[4] "Since only framework Al pairs can stabilize divalent cationic species, the correlation between densities of framework Al pairs and GaHx species indicates that the precursor of GaHx is likely a divalent cationic species"

[5] "Based on the pulse titration results, there are three types of Ga species present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers."

[6] "It should be emphasized that the PDH rate is dependent on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Framework Al pair density: There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx species formed. This suggests that framework Al pairs are crucial for stabilizing the precursor of GaHx, which is likely a divalent cationic species.

2. Ga/Al ratio: The intensity of the GaHx band initially increases with Ga loading, reaching a maximum at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1, and then declines as the ratio exceeds 0.56. This indicates that there is an optimal Ga loading for the formation of GaHx species.

3. Si/Al ratio: The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework Al pairs, which in turn influences the formation of GaHx species. Lower Si/Al ratios generally lead to higher framework Al pair densities, potentially allowing for more GaHx formation.

4. Active gallium species: Three types of Ga species are present on reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The distribution of these species is influenced by the Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios.

5. PDH activity: The propane dehydrogenation rate depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, indicating that the catalyst's activity is a complex function of its composition and the resulting gallium species formed.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are closely tied to the interplay between Ga loading, zeolite composition, and the formation of specific active gallium species, particularly GaHx. Optimizing these parameters is crucial for developing highly effective PDH catalysts.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度显著影响Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质，揭示了丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中重要的结构-活性相关性：

1. 骨架铝对密度：骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx物种数量之间存在线性相关性。这表明骨架铝对对于稳定GaHx前体（可能是二价阳离子物种）至关重要。

2. Ga/Al比率：GaHx带的强度最初随Ga负载量增加而增加，在Ga/Al比率为0.1时达到最大值，然后在比率超过0.56时下降。这表明GaHx物种的形成存在最佳Ga负载量。

3. Si/Al比率：Si/Al比率影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响GaHx物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比率通常会导致更高的骨架铝对密度，可能允许形成更多的GaHx。

4. 活性镓物种：还原后的催化剂上存在三种类型的Ga物种：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚体。这些物种的分布受Ga/Al和Si/Al比率的影响。

5. PDH活性：丙烷脱氢速率同时取决于Si/Al和Ga/Al比率，表明催化剂的活性是其组成和由此形成的镓物种的复杂函数。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性与Ga负载量、沸石组成以及特定活性镓物种（特别是GaHx）的形成之间的相互作用密切相关。优化这些参数对于开发高效的PDH催化剂至关重要。
