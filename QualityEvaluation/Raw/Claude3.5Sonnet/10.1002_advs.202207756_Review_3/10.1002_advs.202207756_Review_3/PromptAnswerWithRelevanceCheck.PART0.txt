[1] "The GaHx band initially increased in intensity with Ga loading before leveling off at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.1 on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), and declined as the Ga/Al ratio rose above 0.56 (Figure 7c)."

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts have significant influences on the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Ga/Al ratio: The intensity of the GaHx band, indicative of gallium hydride formation, initially increases with Ga loading, reaches a maximum around a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1, and then declines at higher ratios. This suggests an optimal Ga loading for gallium hydride formation.

2. Framework Al pair density: There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx formed, indicating that framework Al pairs play a crucial role in stabilizing the precursors of gallium hydrides.

3. Si/Al ratio: The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework Al pairs, which in turn influences the formation of active gallium species. Lower Si/Al ratios generally lead to higher framework Al pair densities and thus more opportunities for active gallium species formation.

4. Types of gallium species: Three types of gallium species are present in reduced catalysts: Ga2O22+, Ga+, and unreduced Ga(III)xOy oligomers. The distribution of these species is influenced by the Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios.

5. Catalytic activity: The turnover frequency (TOF) for PDH reactions shows a complex dependence on both Ga/Al and Si/Al ratios. Initially, TOF increases rapidly with Ga loading, then more slowly, and finally declines at higher Ga/Al ratios. This trend suggests an optimal Ga loading for maximum catalytic activity.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are intricate and dependent on multiple factors. The optimal performance is achieved through a delicate balance of Ga loading, framework Al pair density, and Si/Al ratio, which together determine the nature and distribution of active gallium species.

Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中对活性镓物种（包括镓氢化物）的形成和性质有重要影响，揭示了在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中催化剂的结构-活性相关性：

1. Ga/Al比例：GaHx带的强度（表示镓氢化物的形成）最初随Ga负载量增加而增加，在Ga/Al比例约为0.1时达到最大值，然后在更高比例下降低。这表明存在最佳的Ga负载量以形成镓氢化物。

2. 骨架铝对密度：骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx量之间存在线性相关关系，表明骨架铝对在稳定镓氢化物前体方面起着关键作用。

3. Si/Al比例：Si/Al比例影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响活性镓物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比例通常导致更高的骨架铝对密度，从而为活性镓物种的形成提供更多机会。

4. 镓物种类型：还原后的催化剂中存在三种镓物种：Ga2O22+、Ga+和未还原的Ga(III)xOy寡聚体。这些物种的分布受Ga/Al和Si/Al比例的影响。

5. 催化活性：PDH反应的转化频率（TOF）对Ga/Al和Si/Al比例都有复杂的依赖关系。最初，TOF随Ga负载量快速增加，然后增长速度减缓，最后在更高的Ga/Al比例下降低。这一趋势表明存在最佳的Ga负载量以获得最大催化活性。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性是复杂的，依赖于多个因素。通过精细平衡Ga负载量、骨架铝对密度和Si/Al比例，可以获得最佳性能，这些因素共同决定了活性镓物种的性质和分布。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The Si/Al ratio affects the density of framework aluminum pairs, which in turn influences the formation of gallium species. Lower Si/Al ratios result in higher densities of framework Al pairs, allowing for more exchanged cations and potentially more active gallium sites.

The Ga/Al ratio impacts the formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx). As the Ga loading increases, the GaHx band intensity initially rises, reaches a maximum, and then declines at higher Ga/Al ratios. This suggests an optimal Ga/Al ratio for forming GaHx species.

There is a linear correlation between the framework Al pair density and the amount of GaHx formed, indicating that framework Al pairs play a crucial role in stabilizing the precursors of GaHx species. These precursors are likely divalent cationic species, such as Ga2O22+.

The PDH rate depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, highlighting the complex interplay between zeolite composition and gallium loading in determining catalyst activity. The most active PDH species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is identified as Ga2O22+.

These relationships reveal that the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in PDH reactions are closely tied to the zeolite's composition and the nature of the gallium species formed. Optimizing the Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios is crucial for maximizing the formation of active gallium species and achieving high PDH performance.

Si/Al比例影响骨架铝对的密度，进而影响镓物种的形成。较低的Si/Al比例导致较高的骨架铝对密度，允许更多的交换阳离子和潜在的更多活性镓位点。

Ga/Al比例影响镓氢化物（GaHx）的形成。随着Ga负载量的增加，GaHx带的强度最初上升，达到最大值，然后在较高的Ga/Al比例下下降。这表明存在一个形成GaHx物种的最佳Ga/Al比例。

骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx量之间存在线性相关性，表明骨架铝对在稳定GaHx物种前体方面起着关键作用。这些前体可能是二价阳离子物种，如Ga2O22+。

PDH速率同时依赖于Si/Al和Ga/Al比例，凸显了沸石组成和镓负载量在决定催化剂活性方面的复杂相互作用。在Ga/H-ZSM-5上，最活跃的PDH物种被确定为Ga2O22+。

这些关系揭示了催化剂在PDH反应中的结构-活性相关性与沸石的组成和形成的镓物种的性质密切相关。优化Si/Al和Ga/Al比例对于最大化活性镓物种的形成和实现高PDH性能至关重要。

The Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts significantly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, revealing important structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

The formation of gallium hydrides (GaHx) is directly related to the Ga/Al ratio. As the Ga loading increases, the GaHx band intensity initially rises, reaches a maximum at a Ga/Al ratio of 0.1, and then declines at higher ratios. This trend suggests an optimal Ga loading for forming GaHx species.

The Si/Al ratio affects the maximum intensity of the GaHx band. Lower Si/Al ratios (e.g., 15) result in higher maximum GaHx band intensities compared to higher Si/Al ratios (e.g., 28). This indicates that zeolites with lower Si/Al ratios can accommodate more GaHx species.

Framework aluminum pair density shows a linear correlation with the amount of GaHx formed. This relationship suggests that framework Al pairs are crucial for stabilizing the precursor of GaHx, which is likely a divalent cationic species.

The catalytic activity in PDH reactions, measured by turnover frequency (TOF), depends on both Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. For example, in samples with a Si/Al ratio of 15, the TOF varies significantly with Ga/Al ratio, revealing the presence of two distinct types of Ga sites with different PDH activities.

These relationships demonstrate that the zeolite framework composition (Si/Al ratio) and Ga loading (Ga/Al ratio) play crucial roles in determining the nature and quantity of active Ga species. The framework Al pair density is particularly important for the formation of specific active sites like GaHx. Together, these factors contribute to the complex structure-activity correlations observed in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of optimizing both zeolite composition and Ga loading to achieve desired catalytic performance.

Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对密度在Ga改性沸石催化剂中显著影响活性镓物种的形成和性质，包括镓氢化物，揭示了丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中重要的结构-活性相关性。

镓氢化物(GaHx)的形成与Ga/Al比率直接相关。随着Ga负载量的增加，GaHx带强度最初上升，在Ga/Al比率为0.1时达到最大值，然后在更高比率下下降。这一趋势表明存在形成GaHx物种的最佳Ga负载量。

Si/Al比率影响GaHx带的最大强度。较低的Si/Al比率（如15）导致较高的最大GaHx带强度，相比之下较高的Si/Al比率（如28）则较低。这表明具有较低Si/Al比率的沸石可以容纳更多的GaHx物种。

骨架铝对密度与形成的GaHx数量呈线性相关。这种关系表明，骨架Al对对于稳定GaHx前体（可能是二价阳离子物种）至关重要。

PDH反应中的催化活性，以转化频率(TOF)衡量，取决于Si/Al和Ga/Al比率。例如，在Si/Al比率为15的样品中，TOF随Ga/Al比率显著变化，揭示了存在两种具有不同PDH活性的不同类型的Ga位点。

这些关系表明，沸石骨架组成（Si/Al比率）和Ga负载量（Ga/Al比率）在决定活性Ga物种的性质和数量方面起着关键作用。骨架Al对密度对于形成特定活性位点（如GaHx）尤为重要。这些因素共同构成了Ga改性沸石催化剂在PDH反应中观察到的复杂结构-活性相关性，强调了优化沸石组成和Ga负载量以实现所需催化性能的重要性。
