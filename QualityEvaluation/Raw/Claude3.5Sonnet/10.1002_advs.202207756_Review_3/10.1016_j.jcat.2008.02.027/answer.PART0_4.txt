[1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "Formation of two isolated gallyl ions in a single side-pocket of MOR (1) requires a slightly unfavorable coordination of one of the GaO+ cations to the zeolite wall."

[3] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+2 sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

[4] "Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 → 4). The calculated reaction energy of ΔE = −62 kJ/mol is lower than that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on isolated gallyl ion in II (ΔE = 258 kJ/mol), while the difference in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Table 1)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the provided information:

1. The study uses a high-silica zeolite model with a Si/Al ratio of 23 (48 Si atoms, 2 Al atoms).

2. The formation of binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters is found to be highly stable and predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

3. The distribution of framework aluminum atoms influences the stability and configuration of gallium species. Different Al distributions result in varying stabilities of gallium oxide structures.

4. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters show higher activity for C-H bond activation in ethane compared to isolated gallyl (GaO+) ions, suggesting that these binuclear species may be more active in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The formation of gallium hydrides is not explicitly discussed in the context of propane dehydrogenation, but the study mentions hydrogen recombination steps involving Ga-H species in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle.

While the study does not directly address structure-activity correlations for propane dehydrogenation, it suggests that the formation of binuclear gallium oxide clusters in high-silica zeolites may be beneficial for alkane activation reactions. The specific influence of Ga/Al ratio and framework aluminum pair density on catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation cannot be conclusively determined from the given information.

这篇文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝原子对密度如何影响Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质的全面信息，特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中。然而，从提供的信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 该研究使用了一个高硅沸石模型，Si/Al比为23（48个Si原子，2个Al原子）。

2. 在氧化的含镓高硅沸石中，当镓含量接近离子交换容量时，发现二核Ga2O2+2簇的形成是高度稳定的，并且占主导地位。

3. 骨架铝原子的分布影响镓物种的稳定性和构型。不同的Al分布会导致镓氧化物结构稳定性的变化。

4. 与单核镓基（GaO+）离子相比，二核Ga2O2+2簇在乙烷C-H键活化方面表现出更高的活性，这表明这些二核物种在丙烷脱氢反应中可能更加活跃。

5. 虽然在丙烷脱氢的背景下没有明确讨论镓氢化物的形成，但该研究在乙烷脱氢循环中提到了涉及Ga-H物种的氢重组步骤。

尽管该研究没有直接解决丙烷脱氢的结构-活性相关性，但它表明在高硅沸石中形成二核镓氧化物簇可能有利于烷烃活化反应。从给定的信息中无法确定地得出Ga/Al比例和骨架铝原子对密度对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的具体影响。
