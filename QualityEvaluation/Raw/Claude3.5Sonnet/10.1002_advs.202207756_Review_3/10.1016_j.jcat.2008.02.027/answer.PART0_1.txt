[1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+2 sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

[3] "Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 → 4). The calculated reaction energy of ΔE = −62 kJ/mol is lower than that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on isolated gallyl ion in II (ΔE = −258 kJ/mol), while the difference in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Table 1)."

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. The study used a high-silica zeolite model with a Si/Al ratio of 23:1, which is considered a high-silica zeolite.

2. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters were found to be extremely stable and likely predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

3. These binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters showed better catalytic performance for ethane dehydrogenation compared to isolated gallyl ions, with lower reaction energy for C-H bond activation.

4. The study suggests that the formation and stability of these active gallium species may not be strongly dependent on the proximity of framework aluminum sites, as different Al distributions still resulted in stable Ga2O2+2 clusters.

However, the study does not directly address propane dehydrogenation or provide detailed information on how varying the Ga/Al ratio or framework aluminum pair density affects the catalyst's structure-activity correlations.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对分布如何影响活性镓物种的形成和性质以及这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中揭示的催化剂结构-活性相关性的问题。但是，可以得出一些见解：

1. 该研究使用了Si/Al比为23:1的高硅沸石模型，被认为是高硅沸石。

2. 双核Ga2O2+2簇被发现具有极高的稳定性，并且在镓含量接近离子交换容量的氧化镓含高硅沸石中可能占主导地位。

3. 与单独的镓基离子相比，这些双核Ga2O2+2簇在乙烷脱氢方面表现出更好的催化性能，C-H键活化的反应能更低。

4. 研究表明，这些活性镓物种的形成和稳定性可能不强烈依赖于骨架铝位点的邻近性，因为不同的Al分布仍然可以形成稳定的Ga2O2+2簇。

然而，该研究并未直接涉及丙烷脱氢，也没有提供关于改变Ga/Al比例或骨架铝对分布如何影响催化剂结构-活性相关性的详细信息。
