[1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "The energy of the initial system with two Ga+ ions does not depend on the Al distribution in the zeolite."

[3] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+2 sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. 

However, the study does provide some relevant insights:

1. The model used a high-silica zeolite (mordenite) with a Si/Al ratio of 23:1.

2. The initial energy of Ga+ ions was found to be independent of Al distribution in the zeolite framework.

3. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters were calculated to be extremely stable and are expected to be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

4. The study did not directly investigate propane dehydrogenation, but rather focused on ethane dehydrogenation as a model reaction.

These findings suggest that the formation of binuclear gallium-oxo clusters is favored in high-silica zeolites with gallium content matching the ion-exchange capacity, regardless of the specific Al distribution. However, the study does not provide detailed information on how varying Ga/Al ratios or framework aluminum pair densities might affect the nature of active sites or catalyst activity.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对分布如何影响镓改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质的问题,特别是在丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性。

然而,该研究确实提供了一些相关的见解:

1. 该模型使用了一种高硅沸石(丝光沸石),其Si/Al比为23:1。

2. 发现Ga+离子的初始能量与沸石骨架中的Al分布无关。

3. 计算表明双核Ga2O2+2簇极其稳定,预计在氧化的含镓高硅沸石中占主导地位,特别是当镓含量接近离子交换容量时。

4. 该研究没有直接研究丙烷脱氢,而是以乙烷脱氢作为模型反应进行研究。

这些发现表明,在镓含量与离子交换容量相匹配的高硅沸石中,倾向于形成双核镓-氧簇,而不受特定Al分布的影响。然而,该研究没有提供关于改变Ga/Al比例或骨架铝对分布如何影响活性位点性质或催化剂活性的详细信息。
