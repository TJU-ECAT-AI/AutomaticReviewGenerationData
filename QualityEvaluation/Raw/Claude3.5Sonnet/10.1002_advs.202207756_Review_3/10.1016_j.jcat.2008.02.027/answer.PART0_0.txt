[1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+ sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

[3] "Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 → 4). The calculated reaction energy of ΔE = −62 kJ/mol is lower than that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on isolated gallyl ion in II (ΔE = 258 kJ/mol), while the difference in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Table 1)."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation of active gallium species in zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. However, the study focuses on a high-silica mordenite model with Si/Al ratio of 23 and examines the formation of binuclear gallium-oxide clusters.

The research suggests that binuclear Ga2O2+ clusters are likely to be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the gallium content is close to the ion-exchange capacity. These clusters are found to be extremely stable and do not necessarily require proximate framework aluminum sites for stabilization.

The study demonstrates that these binuclear gallium-oxide clusters are more active for ethane dehydrogenation compared to isolated gallyl ions. The C-H bond activation step over the binuclear cluster is more exothermic and has a lower activation barrier than over the isolated gallyl ion.

While the study does not directly address propane dehydrogenation, the findings for ethane suggest that similar structure-activity correlations may apply for propane. The stability and activity of the binuclear gallium-oxide clusters indicate that they could be important active sites in gallium-modified zeolite catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对分布密度对沸石催化剂中活性镓物种形成的影响的详细信息。然而，该研究关注了一个Si/Al比为23的高硅丝光沸石模型，并研究了双核镓-氧化物簇的形成。

研究表明，当镓含量接近离子交换容量时，双核Ga2O2+簇可能在氧化的含镓高硅沸石中占主导地位。这些簇被发现具有极高的稳定性，并且不一定需要邻近的骨架铝位点来稳定。

研究表明，与单独的镓基离子相比，这些双核镓-氧化物簇对乙烷脱氢更具活性。在双核簇上的C-H键活化步骤比在单独的镓基离子上更放热，并且具有更低的活化能垒。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及丙烷脱氢，但对乙烷的研究结果表明，类似的结构-活性相关性可能适用于丙烷。双核镓-氧化物簇的稳定性和活性表明，它们可能是镓改性沸石催化剂中烷烃脱氢反应的重要活性位点。
