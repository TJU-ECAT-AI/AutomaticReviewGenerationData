          [1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+2 sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

[3] "Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 → 4). The calculated reaction energy of ΔE = −62 kJ/mol is lower than that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on isolated gallyl ion in II (ΔE = −258 kJ/mol), while the difference in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Table 1)."

[4] "The important question here is whether proximate Al substitutions in the zeolite framework are necessary to stabilize these binuclear cationic species."

[5] "Formation of two isolated gallyl ions in a single side-pocket of MOR (1) requires a slightly unfavorable coordination of one of the GaO+ cations to the zeolite wall."

          The literature provides some insights into the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum distribution on the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts, although it does not fully address the question for propane dehydrogenation reactions. Key findings include:

1. The study used a high-silica zeolite model with a Si/Al ratio of 23 (48 Si atoms, 2 Al atoms).

2. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters were found to be extremely stable and likely predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

3. The formation and stability of these active gallium species may not be strongly dependent on the proximity of framework aluminum sites, as different Al distributions still resulted in stable Ga2O2+2 clusters.

4. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters showed better catalytic performance for ethane dehydrogenation compared to isolated gallyl ions, with lower reaction energy for C-H bond activation.

5. The distribution of framework aluminum atoms influences the stability and configuration of gallium species, with different Al distributions resulting in varying stabilities of gallium oxide structures.

While the study does not directly address propane dehydrogenation or provide detailed information on how varying the Ga/Al ratio or framework aluminum pair density affects the catalyst's structure-activity correlations, it suggests that the formation of binuclear gallium oxide clusters in high-silica zeolites may be beneficial for alkane activation reactions.

          该文献提供了一些关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝分布如何影响Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质的见解，尽管它并没有完全回答丙烷脱氢反应的问题。主要发现包括：

1. 该研究使用了一个高硅沸石模型，Si/Al比为23（48个Si原子，2个Al原子）。

2. 发现双核Ga2O2+2簇极其稳定，并且在镓含量接近离子交换容量的氧化含镓高硅沸石中可能占主导地位。

3. 这些活性镓物种的形成和稳定性可能不强烈依赖于骨架铝位点的邻近性，因为不同的Al分布仍然可以形成稳定的Ga2O2+2簇。

4. 与单独的镓基离子相比，双核Ga2O2+2簇在乙烷脱氢方面表现出更好的催化性能，C-H键活化的反应能更低。

5. 骨架铝原子的分布影响镓物种的稳定性和构型，不同的Al分布会导致镓氧化物结构稳定性的变化。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及丙烷脱氢，也没有提供关于改变Ga/Al比例或骨架铝对分布如何影响催化剂结构-活性相关性的详细信息，但它表明在高硅沸石中形成双核镓氧化物簇可能有利于烷烃活化反应。
