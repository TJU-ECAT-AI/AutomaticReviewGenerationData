How do the Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, and what do these relationships reveal about the catalyst's structure-activity correlations in propane dehydrogenation reactions?

[1] "To model a high-silica zeolite, a supercell was used. It was constructed by doubling the monoclinic unit cell along the c axis. The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. To model gallium-exchanged mordenite two framework silicon ions were substituted with aluminums."

[2] "Thus, taking into account the above discussion and the extreme calculated stability of binuclear Ga2O2+ sites in mordenite, we conclude that such clusters should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites with a Ga content close to the ion-exchange capacity."

[3] "Initial CH bond cleavage of C2H6 over 3 is exothermic with a moderate activation barrier (3 + C2H6 → 4). The calculated reaction energy of ΔE = −62 kJ/mol is lower than that computed for dissociative chemisorption of ethane on isolated gallyl ion in II (ΔE = 258 kJ/mol), while the difference in the activation energy barriers is much less pronounced (Table 1)."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on the formation of active gallium species in zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. However, the study focuses on a high-silica mordenite model with Si/Al ratio of 23 and examines the formation of binuclear gallium-oxide clusters.

The research suggests that binuclear Ga2O2+ clusters are likely to be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the gallium content is close to the ion-exchange capacity. These clusters are found to be extremely stable and do not necessarily require proximate framework aluminum sites for stabilization.

The study demonstrates that these binuclear gallium-oxide clusters are more active for ethane dehydrogenation compared to isolated gallyl ions. The C-H bond activation step over the binuclear cluster is more exothermic and has a lower activation barrier than over the isolated gallyl ion.

While the study does not directly address propane dehydrogenation, the findings for ethane suggest that similar structure-activity correlations may apply for propane. The stability and activity of the binuclear gallium-oxide clusters indicate that they could be important active sites in gallium-modified zeolite catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对分布密度对沸石催化剂中活性镓物种形成的影响的详细信息。然而，该研究关注了一个Si/Al比为23的高硅丝光沸石模型，并研究了双核镓-氧化物簇的形成。

研究表明，当镓含量接近离子交换容量时，双核Ga2O2+簇可能在氧化的含镓高硅沸石中占主导地位。这些簇被发现具有极高的稳定性，并且不一定需要邻近的骨架铝位点来稳定。

研究表明，与单独的镓基离子相比，这些双核镓-氧化物簇对乙烷脱氢更具活性。在双核簇上的C-H键活化步骤比在单独的镓基离子上更放热，并且具有更低的活化能垒。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及丙烷脱氢，但对乙烷的研究结果表明，类似的结构-活性相关性可能适用于丙烷。双核镓-氧化物簇的稳定性和活性表明，它们可能是镓改性沸石催化剂中烷烃脱氢反应的重要活性位点。

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. The study used a high-silica zeolite model with a Si/Al ratio of 23:1, which is considered a high-silica zeolite.

2. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters were found to be extremely stable and likely predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

3. These binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters showed better catalytic performance for ethane dehydrogenation compared to isolated gallyl ions, with lower reaction energy for C-H bond activation.

4. The study suggests that the formation and stability of these active gallium species may not be strongly dependent on the proximity of framework aluminum sites, as different Al distributions still resulted in stable Ga2O2+2 clusters.

However, the study does not directly address propane dehydrogenation or provide detailed information on how varying the Ga/Al ratio or framework aluminum pair density affects the catalyst's structure-activity correlations.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对分布如何影响活性镓物种的形成和性质以及这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中揭示的催化剂结构-活性相关性的问题。但是，可以得出一些见解：

1. 该研究使用了Si/Al比为23:1的高硅沸石模型，被认为是高硅沸石。

2. 双核Ga2O2+2簇被发现具有极高的稳定性，并且在镓含量接近离子交换容量的氧化镓含高硅沸石中可能占主导地位。

3. 与单独的镓基离子相比，这些双核Ga2O2+2簇在乙烷脱氢方面表现出更好的催化性能，C-H键活化的反应能更低。

4. 研究表明，这些活性镓物种的形成和稳定性可能不强烈依赖于骨架铝位点的邻近性，因为不同的Al分布仍然可以形成稳定的Ga2O2+2簇。

然而，该研究并未直接涉及丙烷脱氢，也没有提供关于改变Ga/Al比例或骨架铝对分布如何影响催化剂结构-活性相关性的详细信息。

However, the study does provide some relevant insights:

1. The model used a high-silica zeolite (mordenite) with a Si/Al ratio of 23:1.

2. The initial energy of Ga+ ions was found to be independent of Al distribution in the zeolite framework.

3. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters were calculated to be extremely stable and are expected to be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

4. The study did not directly investigate propane dehydrogenation, but rather focused on ethane dehydrogenation as a model reaction.

These findings suggest that the formation of binuclear gallium-oxo clusters is favored in high-silica zeolites with gallium content matching the ion-exchange capacity, regardless of the specific Al distribution. However, the study does not provide detailed information on how varying Ga/Al ratios or framework aluminum pair densities might affect the nature of active sites or catalyst activity.

然而,该研究确实提供了一些相关的见解:

1. 该模型使用了一种高硅沸石(丝光沸石),其Si/Al比为23:1。

2. 发现Ga+离子的初始能量与沸石骨架中的Al分布无关。

3. 计算表明双核Ga2O2+2簇极其稳定,预计在氧化的含镓高硅沸石中占主导地位,特别是当镓含量接近离子交换容量时。

4. 该研究没有直接研究丙烷脱氢,而是以乙烷脱氢作为模型反应进行研究。

这些发现表明,在镓含量与离子交换容量相匹配的高硅沸石中,倾向于形成双核镓-氧簇,而不受特定Al分布的影响。然而,该研究没有提供关于改变Ga/Al比例或骨架铝对分布如何影响活性位点性质或催化剂活性的详细信息。

4. The study does not directly address gallium hydrides or provide detailed structure-activity correlations for propane dehydrogenation.

Overall, while the research provides some insights into gallium speciation in high-silica zeolites, it does not comprehensively address the influence of Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density on catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献并没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对分布如何影响在沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成的问题，以及这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中揭示了哪些催化剂的结构-活性相关性。但是，我们可以得出一些相关的见解：

1. 该研究使用了一个高硅沸石模型，Si/Al比为23（48个Si原子，2个Al原子）。

2. 研究调查了邻近的Al取代是否必要来稳定双核阳离子镓物种，这表明骨架铝的分布可能在镓物种的形成中起作用。

3. 计算表明，只要镓含量接近离子交换容量，双核Ga2O2+2簇在高硅沸石中可以稳定存在，而不受特定Al分布的影响。

4. 该研究没有直接涉及镓氢化物，也没有提供丙烷脱氢反应的详细结构-活性相关性。

总的来说，虽然这项研究为高硅沸石中的镓物种形成提供了一些见解，但它并没有全面地解释Ga/Al比例、Si/Al比例和骨架铝对分布对丙烷脱氢反应中催化剂性能的影响。

1. The study uses a high-silica zeolite model with a Si/Al ratio of 23 (48 Si atoms, 2 Al atoms).

2. The formation of binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters is found to be highly stable and predominant in oxidized gallium-containing high-silica zeolites when the Ga content is close to the ion-exchange capacity.

3. The distribution of framework aluminum atoms influences the stability and configuration of gallium species. Different Al distributions result in varying stabilities of gallium oxide structures.

4. Binuclear Ga2O2+2 clusters show higher activity for C-H bond activation in ethane compared to isolated gallyl (GaO+) ions, suggesting that these binuclear species may be more active in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The formation of gallium hydrides is not explicitly discussed in the context of propane dehydrogenation, but the study mentions hydrogen recombination steps involving Ga-H species in the ethane dehydrogenation cycle.

While the study does not directly address structure-activity correlations for propane dehydrogenation, it suggests that the formation of binuclear gallium oxide clusters in high-silica zeolites may be beneficial for alkane activation reactions. The specific influence of Ga/Al ratio and framework aluminum pair density on catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation cannot be conclusively determined from the given information.
