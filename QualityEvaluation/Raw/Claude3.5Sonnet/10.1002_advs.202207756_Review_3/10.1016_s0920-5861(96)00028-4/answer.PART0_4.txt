[1] "The Ga content in ion exchanged Zn/H-ZSM5 was 1.3 wt%. Zn, which corresponds to a Zn/Al atomic ratio of 0.20 in this sample. The Zn content of the impregnated Zn/H-ZSM5 was 2.8 wt% (Zn/Al = 0.41). The Ga/H-ZSM5 sample was measured to have a Ga content of 2.1 wt% (Ga/Al = 0.29)."

[2] "The Si and Al content in H-ZSM5 was measured by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The atomic Si/Al ratio in the Zeochem material was 14.5."

[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[4] "These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. Ion exchange occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at 700-800 K via vapor phase exchange of volatile GaI+ species."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, some relevant information can be extracted:

The Ga/Al ratio in the Ga/H-ZSM5 sample was 0.29, with a Ga content of 2.1 wt%. The Si/Al ratio of the H-ZSM5 zeolite was 14.5. These ratios likely influence the distribution and nature of gallium species, but specific correlations are not discussed.

Ga species are reported to reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations. Unlike Zn, Ga3+ species do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5. Instead, they initially form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. Ion exchange of Ga occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at high temperatures (700-800 K) via vapor phase exchange of volatile GaI+ species.

The literature mentions that recombinative desorption involves reduction-oxidation cycles of these monomeric cations during dehydrocyclodimerization reactions. However, specific details about gallium hydrides are not provided.

While these findings provide some insight into the nature of active gallium species, the document does not explicitly discuss structure-activity correlations or how the mentioned ratios directly influence catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献没有全面分析Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对分布如何影响Ga改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种的形成和性质在丙烷脱氢反应中的影响。然而,可以提取一些相关信息:

Ga/H-ZSM5样品的Ga/Al比为0.29,Ga含量为2.1 wt%。H-ZSM5沸石的Si/Al比为14.5。这些比率可能会影响镓物种的分布和性质,但未讨论具体的相关性。

据报道,Ga物种以单体阳离子的形式存在于阳离子交换位点。与Zn不同,Ga3+物种不能直接从溶液中交换到H-ZSM5上。相反,它们最初形成沸石外的Ga2O3晶体。Ga的离子交换发生在随后与丙烷或氢气在高温(700-800 K)下接触时,通过挥发性GaI+物种的气相交换进行。

文献提到,在脱氢环二聚反应过程中,这些单体阳离子的复合脱附涉及氧化还原循环。然而,没有提供关于镓氢化物的具体细节。

虽然这些发现为活性镓物种的性质提供了一些见解,但该文档并未明确讨论结构-活性相关性,或上述比率如何直接影响催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。
