[1] "The addition of Ga (Fig. 5) and Zn (Fig. 6) to H-ZSM5 does not appear to perturb these reaction pathways."

[2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[4] "Ga3+ species, however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. Ion exchange occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at 700-800 K via vapor phase exchange of volatile Ga1+ species."

The literature does not provide specific information about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density influence the formation and nature of active gallium species or gallium hydrides in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts. The document does not discuss structure-activity correlations in detail for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

However, the literature does provide some relevant insights:

1. Gallium species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations in the zeolite structure.

2. These gallium species undergo reduction-oxidation cycles during the dehydrocyclodimerization process, which is likely related to their catalytic activity.

3. Ga3+ species do not directly exchange onto H-ZSM5 from solution. Instead, they initially form extrazeolitic Ga2O3 crystals. 

4. The actual ion exchange of gallium into the zeolite structure occurs at high temperatures (700-800 K) through vapor phase exchange of volatile Ga1+ species when in contact with propane or hydrogen.

5. The presence of gallium increases rates of propane conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2, suggesting it plays a key role in the catalyst's activity.

While these points don't directly address the question's specifics about ratios and densities, they do provide some insight into the nature and formation of active gallium species in the catalyst.

该文献没有提供关于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和骨架铝对形成活性镓物种或镓氢化物的性质的具体影响信息，也没有详细讨论丙烷脱氢反应的结构-活性相关性。

然而，文献确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. 镓物种以单体阳离子的形式存在于分子筛结构的阳离子交换位点上。

2. 这些镓物种在脱氢环二聚过程中经历氧化还原循环，这可能与它们的催化活性有关。

3. Ga3+物种不能直接从溶液中与H-ZSM5进行离子交换。相反，它们最初形成分子筛外的Ga2O3晶体。

4. 镓进入分子筛结构的实际离子交换发生在高温下（700-800 K），通过与丙烷或氢接触时挥发性Ga1+物种的气相交换实现。

5. 镓的存在增加了丙烷转化、氢脱附和D2中氘的掺入速率，表明它在催化剂活性中起关键作用。

虽然这些要点没有直接回答问题中关于比率和密度的具体内容，但它们确实为催化剂中活性镓物种的性质和形成提供了一些见解。
