The literature does not provide specific information about how Ga/Al ratio, Si/Al ratio, and framework aluminum pair density directly influence the formation and nature of active gallium species, including gallium hydrides, in Ga-modified zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, some insights can be gleaned from the available information:

1. The Si/Al ratio of 14.5 remained constant throughout exchange procedures and thermal treatments, suggesting it may not significantly influence the formation of active gallium species.

2. Gallium species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations, undergoing reduction-oxidation cycles during dehydrocyclodimerization reactions.

3. The formation of active gallium species involves the reduction of Ga2O3 to volatile Ga2O species, which can then migrate and exchange with protons in the zeolite framework.

4. Ion exchange of gallium occurs at high temperatures (700-800 K) via vapor phase exchange of volatile Ga1+ species.

5. The literature mentions the formation of Ga+ species but does not specifically discuss gallium hydrides.

While the document does not directly address structure-activity correlations, it suggests that the mobility and redox behavior of gallium species play crucial roles in their catalytic activity. The ability of gallium to form volatile species and undergo ion exchange at high temperatures appears to be key to its effectiveness in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未提供关于Ga/Al比率、Si/Al比率和框架铝对密度如何直接影响镓改性沸石催化剂中活性镓物种(包括镓氢化物)的形成和性质的具体信息，也未详述这些关系在丙烷脱氢反应中的结构-活性相关性。然而，从可获得的信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. Si/Al比率为14.5，在交换过程和热处理过程中保持恒定，这表明它可能不会显著影响活性镓物种的形成。

2. 镓物种以单体阳离子的形式存在于阳离子交换位点，在脱氢环化二聚反应过程中经历还原-氧化循环。

3. 活性镓物种的形成涉及Ga2O3还原为挥发性Ga2O物种，然后可以迁移并与沸石框架中的质子交换。

4. 镓的离子交换在高温(700-800 K)下通过挥发性Ga1+物种的气相交换进行。

5. 文献提到了Ga+物种的形成，但没有具体讨论镓氢化物。

虽然文档没有直接讨论结构-活性相关性，但它表明镓物种的迁移性和氧化还原行为在其催化活性中起着关键作用。镓形成挥发性物种并在高温下进行离子交换的能力似乎是其在丙烷脱氢反应中发挥作用的关键。
