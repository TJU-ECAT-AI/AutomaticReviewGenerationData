[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K."

[3] "The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface."

[4] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111)"

[5] "Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various surface science techniques. These include Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).

The process typically involves depositing Ni at 300 K (room temperature) on the Pt substrate, followed by annealing at higher temperatures. LEIS and AES are used to monitor the Ni intensity as the temperature increases, revealing the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region. STM provides visual confirmation of the surface structure, showing the formation of Ni islands at 300 K and their disappearance upon annealing.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides structural models for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which are essential for understanding the electronic properties of these surfaces at the atomic level.

2. It allows researchers to correlate the bimetallic structures with their electronic and chemical properties, which is critical for understanding their behavior in catalytic processes.

3. It helps bridge the gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts used in practical applications, as the behavior of polycrystalline films can be related to that of nanoparticles.

4. It enables the study of different surface structures (e.g., NiPtPt and PtNiPt) and their formation conditions, which is important for tailoring the properties of bimetallic catalysts.

By providing detailed information about the surface composition, structure, and thermal behavior of these bimetallic surfaces, this characterization process contributes significantly to the advancement of surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成，采用了多种表面科学技术。这些技术包括低能离子散射(LEIS)、俄歇电子能谱(AES)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扫描隧道显微镜(STM)。

这个过程通常涉及在300 K（室温）下在Pt基底上沉积Ni，然后在更高温度下退火。LEIS和AES用于监测随温度升高Ni强度的变化，揭示了Ni向亚表面区域的扩散。STM提供了表面结构的直观确认，显示了在300 K时Ni岛的形成以及退火后这些岛的消失。

这个表征过程之所以至关重要，原因如下：

1. 它为密度泛函理论(DFT)计算提供了结构模型，这对于理解这些表面在原子水平上的电子性质至关重要。

2. 它使研究人员能够将双金属结构与其电子和化学性质相关联，这对于理解它们在催化过程中的行为至关重要。

3. 它有助于弥合单晶表面和实际应用中使用的负载催化剂之间的差距，因为多晶薄膜的行为可以与纳米颗粒的行为相关联。

4. 它enables研究不同的表面结构（例如NiPtPt和PtNiPt）及其形成条件，这对于定制双金属催化剂的性质很重要。

通过提供这些双金属表面的表面组成、结构和热行为的详细信息，这个表征过程显著地推动了表面科学和催化研究的进展。
