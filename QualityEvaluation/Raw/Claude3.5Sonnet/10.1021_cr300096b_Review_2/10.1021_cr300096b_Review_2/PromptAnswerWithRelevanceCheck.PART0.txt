[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K."

[3] "The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface."

[4] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111)"

[5] "Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various surface science techniques. These include Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).

The process typically involves depositing Ni at room temperature (300 K) onto the Pt substrate, followed by annealing at higher temperatures. LEIS and AES are used to monitor the Ni and Pt intensities as the annealing temperature increases, providing information about the diffusion of Ni into the Pt substrate. STM imaging is used to visualize the surface structure before and after annealing, showing the formation of Ni islands at room temperature and their subsequent disappearance upon annealing.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides structural models for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, allowing for theoretical predictions of surface properties.

2. It helps correlate bimetallic structures with their electronic and chemical properties, which is essential for understanding their behavior in catalytic processes.

3. It allows researchers to track the formation of different surface structures (e.g., NiPtPt and PtNiPt) as a function of temperature, providing insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of bimetallic surface formation.

4. By comparing results from single-crystal and polycrystalline substrates, it helps bridge the gap between idealized model systems and more realistic catalytic materials.

5. The comprehensive characterization using multiple techniques provides a more complete understanding of the surface structure and composition, which is essential for explaining and predicting the catalytic properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

This process is fundamental to advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it provides the necessary structural and compositional information to understand and optimize the performance of bimetallic catalysts.
