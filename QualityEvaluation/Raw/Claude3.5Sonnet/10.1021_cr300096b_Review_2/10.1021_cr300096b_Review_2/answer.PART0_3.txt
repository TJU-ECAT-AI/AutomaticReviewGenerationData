[2] "For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPtPt(111) surface to 900 K."

[3] "The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces."

[4] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."

[5] "Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various surface science techniques. These include Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).

The process typically involves depositing Ni at room temperature (300 K) and then annealing the surface to higher temperatures. For instance, the NiPtPt(111) surface is annealed from 300 K to 900 K, with characterization performed at different stages. STM images are used to observe surface morphology at different temperatures, such as 300 K and 640 K.

For polycrystalline Pt substrates, a similar process is followed. Ni is deposited at room temperature to create the NiPtPt surface structure, which is then annealed to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides structural models for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which are essential for theoretical studies of these surfaces.

2. It allows researchers to correlate bimetallic structures with their electronic and chemical properties. This correlation is critical for understanding how the surface composition and structure influence the material's behavior.

3. It helps bridge the gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts, which is important for practical applications in catalysis.

4. It enables the observation of surface changes with temperature, providing insights into diffusion processes and surface rearrangements.

By combining various characterization techniques and correlating the results with theoretical calculations, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of these bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is fundamental for advancing surface science and developing more effective catalysts for various applications.

通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，是使用各种表面科学技术进行的。这些技术包括低能离子散射(LEIS)、俄歇电子能谱(AES)、扫描隧道显微镜(STM)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)。

这个过程通常涉及在室温(300 K)下沉积Ni，然后将表面退火到更高的温度。例如，NiPtPt(111)表面从300 K退火到900 K，并在不同阶段进行表征。STM图像用于观察不同温度下的表面形貌，如300 K和640 K。

对于多晶Pt基底，遵循类似的过程。在室温下沉积Ni以创建NiPtPt表面结构，然后退火到更高的温度以获得PtNiPt亚表面结构。

这个表征过程之所以至关重要，有以下几个原因：

1. 它为密度泛函理论(DFT)计算提供了结构模型，这对这些表面的理论研究至关重要。

2. 它允许研究人员将双金属结构与其电子和化学性质相关联。这种相关性对于理解表面组成和结构如何影响材料行为至关重要。

3. 它有助于弥合单晶表面和负载型催化剂之间的差距，这对催化应用的实际应用很重要。

4. 它能够观察表面随温度的变化，提供关于扩散过程和表面重排的见解。

通过结合各种表征技术并将结果与理论计算相关联，研究人员可以全面了解这些双金属表面。这些知识对于推进表面科学和开发更有效的催化剂用于各种应用至关重要。
