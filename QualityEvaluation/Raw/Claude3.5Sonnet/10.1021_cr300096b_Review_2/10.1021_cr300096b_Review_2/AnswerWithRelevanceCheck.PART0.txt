          [1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K."

[3] "The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface."

[4] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111)"

[5] "Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using various surface science techniques. These include Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).

The process typically involves depositing Ni at room temperature (300 K) on the Pt substrate, followed by annealing at higher temperatures, up to 900 K. LEIS and AES are used to monitor the Ni and Pt intensities as the annealing temperature increases, providing information about the diffusion of Ni into the Pt substrate. STM imaging is used to visualize the surface structure before and after annealing, showing the formation of Ni islands at room temperature and their subsequent disappearance upon annealing.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides structural models for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, allowing for theoretical predictions of surface properties.

2. It helps correlate bimetallic structures with their electronic and chemical properties, which is essential for understanding their behavior in catalytic processes.

3. It allows researchers to track the formation of different surface structures (e.g., NiPtPt and PtNiPt) as a function of temperature, providing insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of bimetallic surface formation.

4. By comparing results from single-crystal and polycrystalline substrates, it helps bridge the gap between idealized model systems and more realistic catalytic materials.

5. The comprehensive characterization using multiple techniques provides a more complete understanding of the surface structure and composition, which is essential for explaining and predicting the catalytic properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

This process is fundamental to advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it provides the necessary structural and compositional information to understand and optimize the performance of bimetallic catalysts.

          通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过各种表面科学技术进行的。这些技术包括低能离子散射(LEIS)、俄歇电子能谱(AES)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和扫描隧道显微镜(STM)。

这个过程通常涉及在室温(300 K)下将Ni沉积到Pt基底上，然后在更高的温度下退火，最高可达900 K。LEIS和AES用于监测退火温度升高时Ni和Pt的强度，提供有关Ni向Pt基底扩散的信息。STM成像用于在退火前后可视化表面结构，显示在室温下Ni岛的形成以及退火后它们的消失。

这个表征过程至关重要，原因如下：

1. 它为密度泛函理论(DFT)计算提供了结构模型，允许对表面性质进行理论预测。

2. 它有助于将双金属结构与其电子和化学性质相关联，这对于理解它们在催化过程中的行为至关重要。

3. 它允许研究人员跟踪不同表面结构（例如NiPtPt和PtNiPt）随温度变化的形成，提供了双金属表面形成的热力学和动力学见解。

4. 通过比较单晶和多晶基底的结果，它有助于弥合理想化模型系统和更真实的催化材料之间的差距。

5. 使用多种技术进行全面表征提供了对表面结构和成分更完整的理解，这对解释和预测这些双金属表面的催化性质至关重要。

这个过程对于先进的表面科学和催化研究是基础性的，因为它提供了必要的结构和成分信息，以理解和优化双金属催化剂的性能。
