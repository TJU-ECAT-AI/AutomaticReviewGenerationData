Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The document focuses on Fe growth and alloying on Pt(997) surfaces, and does not discuss Ni/Pt systems or their characterization methods. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information about the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The text primarily discusses the growth and alloying of Fe on Pt(997), which is a different system. There is no mention of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, their synthesis, characterization methods, or their relevance to structural modeling, DFT calculations, or understanding of electronic and chemical properties in the context of surface science and catalysis research.
