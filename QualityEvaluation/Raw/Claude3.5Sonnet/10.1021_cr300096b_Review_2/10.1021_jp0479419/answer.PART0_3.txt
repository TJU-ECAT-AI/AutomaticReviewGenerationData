[1] "Previously, we have conducted extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "We have also found that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. We believe that the presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[3] "Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that Co and Ni both diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions."

[4] "Figure 2 shows the effect of annealing the Co/Pt(111) surfaces with different coverages to temperatures up to 1100 K. In all cases, the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ratio decreases until it reaches approximately zero at 950 K."

[5] "The overall similarities of the Co/Pt(111) and Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic systems are almost certainly related to the similar modification effects of Co and Ni on the Pt(111) surface. Both bimetallic systems form alloy structures where the topmost surface is Pt-enriched and the second layer is Co or Ni-enriched."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through various experimental and theoretical techniques. These include:

1. Temperature-dependent studies: Researchers observe the diffusion of Ni atoms into Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K.

2. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): This technique is used to monitor the relative concentrations of Ni and Pt at different temperatures and coverages.

3. Annealing experiments: Surfaces are annealed to temperatures up to 1100 K to study the diffusion and alloying behavior.

4. Comparison with similar systems: The Ni/Pt(111) system is often compared with Co/Pt(111) due to their similar behaviors.

5. Theoretical studies: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are likely employed to model the electronic structure of these surfaces.

This characterization process is crucial because it provides detailed information about the structure and composition of the bimetallic surfaces. Understanding how Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt subsurface and how this affects the surface structure is key to explaining the novel low-temperature activities observed on these surfaces. The formation of Pt-enriched top layers with Ni-enriched second layers is particularly important for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces.

This comprehensive characterization allows researchers to develop accurate structural models and perform reliable DFT calculations. These, in turn, help explain the observed chemical properties and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. The insights gained from this process are fundamental to advancing our understanding in surface science and catalysis research, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for various applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过各种实验和理论技术进行的。这些包括：

1. 温度依赖性研究：研究人员观察到在300 K以上温度下Ni原子向Pt(111)亚表面区域的扩散。

2. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：这种技术用于监测不同温度和覆盖度下Ni和Pt的相对浓度。

3. 退火实验：将表面退火到1100 K的温度，以研究扩散和合金化行为。

4. 与类似系统比较：由于行为相似，Ni/Pt(111)系统经常与Co/Pt(111)进行比较。

5. 理论研究：可能会采用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来模拟这些表面的电子结构。

这个表征过程是至关重要的，因为它提供了有关双金属表面结构和成分的详细信息。了解Ni原子如何扩散到Pt亚表面以及这如何影响表面结构，对解释这些表面上观察到的新型低温活性至关重要。Pt富集顶层和Ni富集第二层的形成对于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质特别重要。

这种全面的表征使研究人员能够开发准确的结构模型并进行可靠的DFT计算。这反过来有助于解释观察到的双金属表面的化学性质和反应活性。从这个过程中获得的见解对于推进我们在表面科学和催化研究方面的理解至关重要，可能会导致为各种应用设计更高效的催化剂。
