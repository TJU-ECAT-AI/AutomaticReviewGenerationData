[1] "Previously, we have conducted extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "We have also found that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. We believe that the presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[3] "Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that Co and Ni both diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions."

[4] "These calculations clearly show that incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Experimentally, techniques such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) are used to study the surface composition, structure, and reactivity. 

Theoretically, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are employed to model the electronic structure of these surfaces. The process is crucial because it reveals key insights into the behavior of Ni atoms on Pt surfaces, such as their tendency to diffuse into subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. This subsurface diffusion is believed to be critical in inducing the observed low-temperature activity on 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.

The characterization process helps in understanding how the incorporation of subsurface Ni changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and consequently affects the adsorption properties of molecules like hydrogen. This comprehensive approach, combining experimental observations with theoretical calculations, is essential for developing a deep understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it provides real-world data to validate and refine theoretical models. It also enables researchers to correlate observed chemical behaviors with electronic structure, which is fundamental to understanding catalytic properties. By thoroughly characterizing these surfaces, researchers can develop more accurate models and predictions for catalytic behavior, ultimately advancing the field of surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过实验和理论方法相结合进行的。在实验方面，采用温度程序化脱附（TPD）、俄歇电子能谱（AES）和低能电子衍射（LEED）等技术来研究表面成分、结构和反应性。

在理论方面，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算被用来模拟这些表面的电子结构。这个过程至关重要，因为它揭示了Ni原子在Pt表面上行为的关键洞察，例如它们在300 K以上温度下倾向于扩散到亚表面区域。这种亚表面扩散被认为是在1 ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上观察到的低温活性的关键因素。

表征过程有助于理解亚表面Ni的引入如何改变表面Pt d带的电子性质，从而影响氢等分子的吸附性质。这种综合方法，结合实验观察和理论计算，对于深入理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。

这个过程对结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它提供了验证和完善理论模型的真实数据。它还使研究人员能够将观察到的化学行为与电子结构相关联，这对理解催化性质至关重要。通过对这些表面进行全面表征，研究人员可以开发出更准确的催化行为模型和预测，最终推动表面科学和催化研究领域的发展。
