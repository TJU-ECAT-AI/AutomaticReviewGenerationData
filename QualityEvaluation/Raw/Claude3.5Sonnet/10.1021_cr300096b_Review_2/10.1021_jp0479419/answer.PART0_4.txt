[1] "Previously, we have conducted extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "We have also found that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. We believe that the presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[3] "Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that Co and Ni both diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions."

[4] "Using AES, which revealed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities (C or O) during Co deposition."

[5] "To estimate the approximate Co coverages, the reduction of the Pt(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak intensity was used to estimate the onset of a monolayer by assuming the formation of a uniform Co monolayer on the Pt(111) surface at 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. Key aspects include:

1. Deposition method: Ni is deposited as a monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates.

2. Temperature effects: Studies show that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K, which is crucial for the observed low-temperature activity.

3. Surface analysis techniques: Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) is used to monitor surface composition and estimate coverage. It helps ensure surface cleanliness (less than 1% impurities) and determine the onset of monolayer formation.

4. Structural modeling: The formation of a uniform Ni monolayer on Pt(111) is assumed for coverage estimations.

5. Theoretical calculations: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are likely employed to model the electronic properties of these surfaces.

This comprehensive characterization is crucial because it provides a detailed understanding of the surface structure, composition, and electronic properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which in turn help explain the observed chemical properties and catalytic behavior. The combination of experimental and theoretical approaches allows researchers to establish structure-property relationships, crucial for advancing surface science and catalysis research. It helps elucidate how the presence of subsurface Ni modifies the electronic and chemical properties of the Pt surface, leading to novel catalytic behaviors.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过实验技术和理论计算的结合来进行。主要方面包括：

1. 沉积方法：在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。

2. 温度效应：研究表明，在300 K以上的温度下，Ni原子会扩散到Pt(111)亚表面区域，这对观察到的低温活性至关重要。

3. 表面分析技术：使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）监测表面成分和估算覆盖度。它有助于确保表面清洁度（杂质少于1%）并确定单层形成的起始点。

4. 结构建模：假设在Pt(111)上形成均匀的Ni单层，用于覆盖度估算。

5. 理论计算：可能采用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来模拟这些表面的电子性质。

这种全面的表征至关重要，因为它提供了对Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构、成分和电子性质的详细理解。这些信息对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，进而有助于解释观察到的化学性质和催化行为。实验和理论方法的结合使研究人员能够建立结构-性质关系，这对推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要。它有助于阐明亚表面Ni的存在如何修改Pt表面的电子和化学性质，从而导致新颖的催化行为。
