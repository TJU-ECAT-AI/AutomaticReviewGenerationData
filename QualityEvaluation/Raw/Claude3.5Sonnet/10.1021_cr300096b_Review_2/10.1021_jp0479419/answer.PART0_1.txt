[1] "Previously, we have conducted extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "We have also found that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. We believe that the presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[3] "Both bimetallic systems form alloy structures where the topmost surface is Pt-enriched and the second layer is Co or Ni-enriched."

[4] "Using a combination of STM and DFT, they found that incorporating Co atoms into the topmost layer increases the calculated CO binding energy, but incorporating the Co atoms into the second layer decreases that binding energy."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through various techniques and approaches:

1. Extensive studies are performed on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces.

2. Temperature-dependent behavior is observed, with Ni atoms diffusing into Pt(111) subsurface regions above 300 K.

3. The structure is characterized as having a Pt-enriched topmost surface and a Ni-enriched second layer.

4. Techniques such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) are used in combination with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

5. The effect of Ni atom incorporation on binding energies (e.g., CO binding) is studied for both surface and subsurface positions.

This characterization process is crucial because:

1. It provides insights into the structural arrangement of the bimetallic surface.

2. It helps understand the temperature-dependent behavior and stability of the surface.

3. It reveals the electronic modifications caused by the presence of subsurface Ni atoms.

4. It allows for the correlation between structure and chemical properties, such as binding energies.

5. The combination of experimental techniques (like STM) with theoretical calculations (DFT) provides a comprehensive understanding of both structural and electronic properties.

6. These insights are essential for modeling the surface structure accurately, performing meaningful DFT calculations, and understanding the unique chemical and catalytic properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

7. The knowledge gained is critical for advancing surface science and catalysis research, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts.
