          [1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

          [2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, followed by annealing. This process causes a significant fraction of Ni atoms to migrate to subsurface sites. The location of Ni atoms (surface vs. subsurface) strongly affects the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the bimetallic surface. DFT calculations show that a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (NiPtPt) increases the HBE compared to pure Ni or Pt, while subsurface Ni (PtNiPt) decreases it.

          This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it reveals how the arrangement of atoms in these bimetallic surfaces impacts their electronic and chemical properties. Understanding these relationships is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows researchers to predict and potentially tailor the behavior of these surfaces for specific applications. The ability to control and predict the properties of bimetallic surfaces based on their preparation methods can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for various applications.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层，然后进行退火。这个过程导致大部分Ni原子迁移到亚表面位置。Ni原子的位置（表面vs亚表面）强烈影响双金属表面的氢结合能（HBE）。DFT计算表明，Pt(111)上的Ni单层（NiPtPt）与纯Ni或Pt相比增加了HBE，而亚表面Ni（PtNiPt）则降低了HBE。

          这种表征过程对结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它揭示了这些双金属表面中原子排列如何影响其电子和化学性质。理解这些关系对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它允许研究人员预测并可能为特定应用定制这些表面的行为。基于制备方法控制和预测这些双金属表面性质的能力可以导致设计出更高效的催化剂，用于各种应用。
