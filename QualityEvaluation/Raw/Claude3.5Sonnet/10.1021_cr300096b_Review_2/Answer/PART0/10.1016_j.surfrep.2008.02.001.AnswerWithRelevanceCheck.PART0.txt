          [1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "Comparing to AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through several key techniques:

1. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD): This is the primary method used to deposit Ni onto Pt(111) surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, which is crucial for surface science studies.

2. Temperature-controlled deposition: The structure of the bimetallic surface (surface or subsurface Ni) is controlled by the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing. For example, deposition at 300 K produces a NiPt(111) surface monolayer, while deposition at 600 K or post-annealing to 600 K results in a PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): These techniques are used for elemental analysis and quantification of the bimetallic surface composition.

4. Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy: This technique is particularly sensitive to the elemental composition of the topmost layer of the bimetallic surface.

5. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM): Used to map surface topography, detect defects, and determine the growth mechanism and morphology of the metal overlayer.

This characterization process is crucial because:

1. It allows precise determination and control of the bimetallic surface structure, which is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations.

2. It provides experimental data on electronic properties and adsorption behavior, which can be compared with and validate DFT predictions.

3. It reveals how the bimetallic surface structure influences chemical properties, such as adsorption strengths and reactivity towards different molecules.

4. It helps understand the stability and dynamic behavior of these surfaces under different conditions (e.g., temperature, presence of adsorbates).

5. It enables a comprehensive understanding of how the formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic and chemical properties compared to the parent metals.

By combining these experimental techniques with DFT calculations, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is vital for advancing surface science and designing more effective catalysts for various applications.

          通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过几种关键技术进行的：

1. 物理气相沉积(PVD)：这是在超高真空(UHV)条件下将Ni沉积到Pt(111)表面的主要方法，这对表面科学研究至关重要。

2. 温度控制沉积：双金属表面的结构（表面或亚表面Ni）通过沉积温度或沉积后退火来控制。例如，在300 K下沉积产生NiPt(111)表面单层，而在600 K下沉积或退火至600 K会产生PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层。

3. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)：这些技术用于元素分析和双金属表面组成的定量。

4. 低能离子散射(LEIS)能谱：这种技术对双金属表面最外层的元素组成特别敏感。

5. 扫描隧道显微镜(STM)：用于绘制表面地形图，检测缺陷，并确定金属覆盖层的生长机制和形貌。

这个表征过程至关重要，因为：

1. 它允许精确确定和控制双金属表面结构，这对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。

2. 它提供了关于电子性质和吸附行为的实验数据，可以与DFT预测进行比较和验证。

3. 它揭示了双金属表面结构如何影响化学性质，如对不同分子的吸附强度和反应性。

4. 它有助于理解这些表面在不同条件下（如温度、吸附物存在）的稳定性和动态行为。

5. 它能够全面理解双金属表面的形成如何改变了与母体金属相比的电子和化学性质。

通过将这些实验技术与DFT计算相结合，研究人员可以全面理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质。这些知识对于推进表面科学和设计更有效的催化剂用于各种应用至关重要。
