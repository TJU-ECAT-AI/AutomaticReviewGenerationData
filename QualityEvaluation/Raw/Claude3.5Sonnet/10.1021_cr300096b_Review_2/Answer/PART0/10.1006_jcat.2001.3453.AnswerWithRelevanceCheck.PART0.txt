          [1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

          [2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

          [3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several key techniques:

          1. Deposition process: Ni is deposited on a Pt(111) substrate maintained at 600 K to ensure uniform coverage across the surface.

          2. Coverage estimation: The Ni overlayer coverage is determined by measuring the reduction in the Pt(237 eV) Auger peak after Ni deposition using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES).

          3. Thickness control: For thick Ni films, deposition continues until the Pt Auger signal is no longer detectable.

          4. Structural confirmation: Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) is used to verify the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111), as evidenced by a sharp (111) pattern.

          This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed information about the surface composition, structure, uniformity, and growth mode. Accurate characterization ensures that subsequent theoretical calculations and experimental interpretations are based on well-defined surfaces, enabling researchers to establish clear structure-property relationships and develop more accurate models for catalytic behavior. This comprehensive understanding is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research, as it allows for the rational design of improved catalysts and the prediction of their performance in various applications. The well-characterized surfaces ensure that the observed chemical properties and catalytic behaviors can be directly linked to the known surface structure, enabling researchers to develop structure-property relationships and design more effective catalysts.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下几个关键技术进行：

          1. 沉积过程：在600 K温度下将Ni沉积在Pt(111)基底上，以确保表面覆盖均匀。

          2. 覆盖度估算：通过使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）测量Ni沉积后Pt(237 eV)俄歇峰的减少来确定Ni覆盖层的覆盖度。

          3. 厚度控制：对于厚Ni薄膜，持续沉积直到Pt俄歇信号不再可检测。

          4. 结构确认：使用低能电子衍射（LEED）来验证Ni在Pt(111)上的外延生长，这通过清晰的(111)衍射图样得到证实。

          这个表征过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了有关表面组成、结构、均匀性和生长模式的详细信息。准确的表征确保后续的理论计算和实验解释基于明确定义的表面，使研究人员能够建立清晰的结构-性能关系，并为催化行为开发更准确的模型。这种全面的理解对于推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它允许合理设计改进的催化剂并预测它们在各种应用中的性能。经过充分表征的表面确保观察到的化学性质和催化行为可以直接与已知的表面结构联系起来，使研究人员能够建立结构-性能关系并设计更有效的催化剂。
