          [1] "We have studied the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1). Using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method we calculate various ordering interactions."

[2] "We find preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a cross-over to fcc growth at increasing deposition."

[3] "The study of two-dimensional order/disorder problems using electronic structure information proceeds most frequently via the definition of a relevant Ising Hamiltonian coupled with a determination of the dominant point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs)"

[4] "We performed standard Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble. We typically started from completely disordered structures and proceeded with nearest-neighbor particle interchanges and diffusion attempts until thermal equilibrium was reached, as monitored by acceptance rates and convergence of thermodynamic averages."

[5] "Using the TB-DCA method and parameters described above we have calculated the point energies and the ECI for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt, which we report in Table 1."

[6] "To address these questions we have performed a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a range of coverages and temperatures."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a combination of theoretical and computational methods. The process includes:

1. Tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging (TB-DCA) method to calculate ordering interactions and point energies.
2. Determination of effective cluster interactions (ECIs) for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface.
3. Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble to study equilibrium structures and phase behavior at different coverages and temperatures.
4. Analysis of adsorption sites (hcp vs fcc) and their preference at different coverages.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it:

1. Provides detailed insights into the initial stages of Ni adsorption and growth on Pt(111).
2. Reveals the ordering and phase behavior of the Ni adlayer at different temperatures and coverages.
3. Elucidates the competition between different superstructures and adsorption sites.
4. Offers information on the electronic structure effects that influence site preference and ordering.
5. Allows for the prediction of surface structures and properties under various conditions.

These theoretical and computational approaches complement experimental studies and provide a foundation for understanding the atomic-scale structure and properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps predict and explain the behavior of these materials in various applications.

这个表征过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它：

1. 提供了Ni在Pt(111)上吸附和生长的初始阶段的详细见解。
2. 揭示了不同温度和覆盖度下Ni吸附层的排序和相行为。
3. 阐明了不同超结构和吸附位点之间的竞争。
4. 提供了影响位点偏好和排序的电子结构效应信息。
5. 允许预测各种条件下的表面结构和性质。

这些理论和计算方法补充了实验研究，为理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的原子尺度结构和性质提供了基础。这些知识对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它有助于预测和解释这些材料在各种应用中的行为。
