[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

[3] "For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures."

[4] "Monolayer coverage of Ni or Co was deposited onto Pt(111) from an evaporative doser, consisting of high-purity Ni or Co wire wrapped around a tungsten filament. The bimetallic structures with surface monolayer of Ni or Co were prepared with the Pt(111) crystal temperature maintained at 300 K; the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were obtained by heating to 600 K based on conditions developed in our previous studies."

[5] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[6] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "The experiments were performed in a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus which is described elsewhere [7], [8]. The Pt(9 9 7) surface was prepared in situ by repeated cycles of 800 eV Ar+ sputtering and annealing to 850 K, followed by a brief exposure to 1×107 mbar oxygen and by a flash anneal to T>1000 K."

[4] "Ni was deposited by means of an e-beam evaporator. After evaporation, the sample was cooled to 77 K; all STM images have been recorded at this temperature."

[5] "Deposition of 0.2 ML Ni at T=300 K results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer."

[6] "At T=150 K, Fig. 1 (a), we observe the nucleation of irregular monolayer islands that grow with one side attached to the ascending step edge. We also observe a large number of bright round spots that appear about 0.4 Å higher than the surrounding Pt. These features represent Ni atoms embedded in Pt, as shown by Schmid et al. in an STM study of the Pt25Ni75(1 1 1) surface [15]."

[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K."

[3] "The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface."

[4] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111)"

[5] "Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

[1] "We have studied the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1). Using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method we calculate various ordering interactions."

[2] "We find preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a cross-over to fcc growth at increasing deposition."

[3] "The study of two-dimensional order/disorder problems using electronic structure information proceeds most frequently via the definition of a relevant Ising Hamiltonian coupled with a determination of the dominant point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs)"

[4] "We performed standard Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble. We typically started from completely disordered structures and proceeded with nearest-neighbor particle interchanges and diffusion attempts until thermal equilibrium was reached, as monitored by acceptance rates and convergence of thermodynamic averages."

[5] "Using the TB-DCA method and parameters described above we have calculated the point energies and the ECI for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt, which we report in Table 1."

[6] "To address these questions we have performed a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a range of coverages and temperatures."

[1] "Low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to study the initial growth and the alloy formation of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) surface."
          
          [2] "AES was used to study the growth mode when Ni ultrathin films were grown on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature."
          
          [3] "The oscillation of LEED intensity has been used to measure the number of layers of a MBE growth"
          
          [4] "The structural evolution of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) at different coverage was observed by LEED."
          
          [5] "We further studied the alloy formation by AES. Ni MVV 102 eV Auger signal was detected."
          
          [6] "The surface structure was obtained by the four-grid video LEED. A computer-controlled image processor measured the intensity of the diffracted spots. The chemical composition of the surface was measured by AES."
          
          [7] "The coverage of Ni was monitored by the relative evolution of Ni and Pt Auger signals. This coverage was double-checked by a quartz balance thickness monitor."

[1] "Previously, we have conducted extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "We have also found that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. We believe that the presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[3] "Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that Co and Ni both diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions."

[4] "These calculations clearly show that incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen."

[5] "Figure 8 shows a comparison of hydrogen desorption on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) surfaces, with the metal deposited (Ni or Co) at crystal temperatures of 600 and 300 K."

[6] "Both bimetallic systems form alloy structures where the topmost surface is Pt-enriched and the second layer is Co or Ni-enriched."

[7] "Using a combination of STM and DFT, they found that incorporating Co atoms into the topmost layer increases the calculated CO binding energy, but incorporating the Co atoms into the second layer decreases that binding energy."

[8] "Figure 2 shows the effect of annealing the Co/Pt(111) surfaces with different coverages to temperatures up to 1100 K. In all cases, the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ratio decreases until it reaches approximately zero at 950 K."

[9] "Using AES, which revealed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities (C or O) during Co deposition."

[10] "To estimate the approximate Co coverages, the reduction of the Pt(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak intensity was used to estimate the onset of a monolayer by assuming the formation of a uniform Co monolayer on the Pt(111) surface at 600 K."

[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4], [5] and experimental studies [6], [8], [9], [16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

[3] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[4] "Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)."

[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "Comparing to AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces."

[1] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (10−7 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[2] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[3] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[4] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces"

[5] "Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[6] "Hwu et al. [31] performed high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to determine the bonding orientation of cyclohexene and its intermediates and found that cyclohexene is di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) and thick Ni film, but only weakly π-bonded on Pt-Ni-Pt(111)."

[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

          [2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

"AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

"Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

"A previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) and density functional theory study (DFT) showed that most of the Ni in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface does not remain on the surface when the Pt(1 1 1) crystal temperature is 600 K"

"The Pt/Ni AES ratio begins to decrease at approximately 600 K and most of the Pt has diffused into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) by temperatures around 1000 K."

"Previous LEED studies indicate that a thick Pt film does not form an ordered (1 1 1) layer on Ni(1 1 1), possibly due to the lattice mismatch between the two metals"

"An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

          "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

          "The electronic structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states (LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms."

          "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydrocarbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."

          "Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure for monoatomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system. A comparison with the monometallic H/Pt(111) and H/Ni(111) cases was made."

[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

          [2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

          [3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

[1] "Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) single crystals at 300 K with and without subsequent annealing at 600 K, and by direct deposition of Ni at 600 K."

[2] "The structure, composition and chemical properties of these surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations showed that subsurface Ni atoms could leads to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms."

[4] "To further elucidate the surface composition, LEIS (1 keV He+) and grazing emission XPS were used to monitor the surface composition of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) following deposition of Ni at 300 and 600 K."

[5] "DFT was used to explore the effect of Ni overlayers, subsurface Ni, and the effect of surface/bulk alloying of Ni and Pt on the metalhydrogen binding energy."

[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

[3] "For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures."

[4] "Monolayer coverage of Ni or Co was deposited onto Pt(111) from an evaporative doser, consisting of high-purity Ni or Co wire wrapped around a tungsten filament. The bimetallic structures with surface monolayer of Ni or Co were prepared with the Pt(111) crystal temperature maintained at 300 K; the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were obtained by heating to 600 K based on conditions developed in our previous studies."

[5] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[6] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "The experiments were performed in a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus which is described elsewhere [7], [8]. The Pt(9 9 7) surface was prepared in situ by repeated cycles of 800 eV Ar+ sputtering and annealing to 850 K, followed by a brief exposure to 1×107 mbar oxygen and by a flash anneal to T>1000 K."

[4] "Ni was deposited by means of an e-beam evaporator. After evaporation, the sample was cooled to 77 K; all STM images have been recorded at this temperature."

[5] "Deposition of 0.2 ML Ni at T=300 K results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer."

[6] "At T=150 K, Fig. 1 (a), we observe the nucleation of irregular monolayer islands that grow with one side attached to the ascending step edge. We also observe a large number of bright round spots that appear about 0.4 Å higher than the surrounding Pt. These features represent Ni atoms embedded in Pt, as shown by Schmid et al. in an STM study of the Pt25Ni75(1 1 1) surface [15]."

[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K."

[3] "The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface."

[4] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111)"

[5] "Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."

[1] "We have studied the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1). Using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method we calculate various ordering interactions."

[2] "We find preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a cross-over to fcc growth at increasing deposition."

[3] "The study of two-dimensional order/disorder problems using electronic structure information proceeds most frequently via the definition of a relevant Ising Hamiltonian coupled with a determination of the dominant point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs)"

[4] "We performed standard Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble. We typically started from completely disordered structures and proceeded with nearest-neighbor particle interchanges and diffusion attempts until thermal equilibrium was reached, as monitored by acceptance rates and convergence of thermodynamic averages."

[5] "Using the TB-DCA method and parameters described above we have calculated the point energies and the ECI for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt, which we report in Table 1."

[6] "To address these questions we have performed a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a range of coverages and temperatures."

[1] "Low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to study the initial growth and the alloy formation of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) surface."
          
          [2] "AES was used to study the growth mode when Ni ultrathin films were grown on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature."
          
          [3] "The oscillation of LEED intensity has been used to measure the number of layers of a MBE growth"
          
          [4] "The structural evolution of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) at different coverage was observed by LEED."
          
          [5] "We further studied the alloy formation by AES. Ni MVV 102 eV Auger signal was detected."
          
          [6] "The surface structure was obtained by the four-grid video LEED. A computer-controlled image processor measured the intensity of the diffracted spots. The chemical composition of the surface was measured by AES."
          
          [7] "The coverage of Ni was monitored by the relative evolution of Ni and Pt Auger signals. This coverage was double-checked by a quartz balance thickness monitor."

[1] "Previously, we have conducted extensive studies on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "We have also found that Ni atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions at temperatures above 300 K. We believe that the presence of subsurface Ni is critical in inducing the low-temperature activity observed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[3] "Experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that Co and Ni both diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface regions."

[4] "These calculations clearly show that incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen."

[5] "Figure 8 shows a comparison of hydrogen desorption on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) surfaces, with the metal deposited (Ni or Co) at crystal temperatures of 600 and 300 K."

[6] "Both bimetallic systems form alloy structures where the topmost surface is Pt-enriched and the second layer is Co or Ni-enriched."

[7] "Using a combination of STM and DFT, they found that incorporating Co atoms into the topmost layer increases the calculated CO binding energy, but incorporating the Co atoms into the second layer decreases that binding energy."

[8] "Figure 2 shows the effect of annealing the Co/Pt(111) surfaces with different coverages to temperatures up to 1100 K. In all cases, the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ratio decreases until it reaches approximately zero at 950 K."

[9] "Using AES, which revealed that the surface contained less than 1% impurities (C or O) during Co deposition."

[10] "To estimate the approximate Co coverages, the reduction of the Pt(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak intensity was used to estimate the onset of a monolayer by assuming the formation of a uniform Co monolayer on the Pt(111) surface at 600 K."

[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4], [5] and experimental studies [6], [8], [9], [16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

[3] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[4] "Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)."

[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "Comparing to AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces."

[1] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (10−7 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[2] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[3] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[4] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces"

[5] "Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[6] "Hwu et al. [31] performed high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to determine the bonding orientation of cyclohexene and its intermediates and found that cyclohexene is di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) and thick Ni film, but only weakly π-bonded on Pt-Ni-Pt(111)."

[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

          [2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

"AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

"Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

"A previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) and density functional theory study (DFT) showed that most of the Ni in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface does not remain on the surface when the Pt(1 1 1) crystal temperature is 600 K"

"The Pt/Ni AES ratio begins to decrease at approximately 600 K and most of the Pt has diffused into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) by temperatures around 1000 K."

"Previous LEED studies indicate that a thick Pt film does not form an ordered (1 1 1) layer on Ni(1 1 1), possibly due to the lattice mismatch between the two metals"

"An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

          "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

          "The electronic structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states (LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms."

          "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydrocarbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."

          "Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure for monoatomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system. A comparison with the monometallic H/Pt(111) and H/Ni(111) cases was made."

[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

          [2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

          [3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

[1] "Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) single crystals at 300 K with and without subsequent annealing at 600 K, and by direct deposition of Ni at 600 K."

[2] "The structure, composition and chemical properties of these surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations showed that subsurface Ni atoms could leads to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms."

[4] "To further elucidate the surface composition, LEIS (1 keV He+) and grazing emission XPS were used to monitor the surface composition of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) following deposition of Ni at 300 and 600 K."

[5] "DFT was used to explore the effect of Ni overlayers, subsurface Ni, and the effect of surface/bulk alloying of Ni and Pt on the metalhydrogen binding energy."
