The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a comprehensive set of surface science techniques and computational methods. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The characterization process typically involves the following steps:
