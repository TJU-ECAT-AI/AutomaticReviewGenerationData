          [1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

[3] "For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures."

[4] "Monolayer coverage of Ni or Co was deposited onto Pt(111) from an evaporative doser, consisting of high-purity Ni or Co wire wrapped around a tungsten filament. The bimetallic structures with surface monolayer of Ni or Co were prepared with the Pt(111) crystal temperature maintained at 300 K; the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were obtained by heating to 600 K based on conditions developed in our previous studies."

[5] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[6] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a multi-step process:

1. Synthesis: Ni monolayers are deposited onto Pt(111) single crystals using an evaporative doser at 300 K. The subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is then obtained by heating to 600 K.

2. Composition analysis: The surface compositions are monitored using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), specifically tracking the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios. Researchers have established benchmarks for interpreting these ratios, estimating that an Auger ratio of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ≈ 1.0 at 600 K corresponds to the onset of a monolayer coverage.

3. Structural characterization: High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) is employed to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which helps in understanding surface segregation phenomena.

4. Stability studies: AES measurements are performed at various temperatures and oxygen exposures to determine the activation barrier for transforming PtNiPt(111) to NiPtPt(111).

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. Structural modeling: It allows researchers to differentiate between surface and subsurface structures. Freshly deposited Ni/Pt surfaces at 300 K are referred to as NiPtPt(111) surface structures, while those heated to 600 K are called PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures.

2. DFT calculations: Accurate structural information is essential for setting up realistic models for density functional theory calculations, ensuring that the theoretical predictions align with the actual surface configurations.

3. Understanding electronic and chemical properties: By precisely characterizing the surface structure, researchers can correlate observed properties with specific atomic arrangements, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of how the bimetallic surface influences electronic structure and chemical reactivity.

4. Advanced surface science research: The ability to precisely characterize and control the surface composition allows for systematic studies of how surface structure affects properties like catalytic activity, providing valuable insights for designing improved catalysts.

5. Catalysis research: Understanding the surface composition and structure is essential for explaining and predicting catalytic performance, as the arrangement of atoms at the surface directly influences adsorption and reaction processes.

This comprehensive characterization approach enables researchers to establish structure-property relationships in Ni/Pt bimetallic systems, which is fundamental for advancing surface science and catalysis research by providing a solid foundation for understanding structure-property relationships in these complex bimetallic systems.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下多步骤过程进行：

1. 合成：使用蒸发器在300 K下将Ni单层沉积到Pt(111)单晶上。然后通过加热到600 K获得亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构。

2. 成分分析：使用俄歇电子能谱(AES)监测表面成分，特别是跟踪Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比率。研究人员已经建立了解释这些比率的基准，估计在600 K时Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比≈1.0对应于单层覆盖的开始。

3. 结构表征：采用高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS)来识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这有助于理解表面偏析现象。

4. 稳定性研究：在不同温度和氧气暴露下进行AES测量，以确定PtNiPt(111)转变为NiPtPt(111)的活化能。

这种表征过程对于以下几个方面至关重要：

1. 结构建模：它允许研究人员区分表面和亚表面结构。在300 K下新沉积的Ni/Pt表面被称为NiPtPt(111)表面结构，而加热到600 K的表面被称为PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构。

2. DFT计算：准确的结构信息对于建立密度泛函理论计算的现实模型至关重要，确保理论预测与实际表面构型一致。

3. 理解电子和化学性质：通过精确表征表面结构，研究人员可以将观察到的性质与特定的原子排列相关联，从而更全面地理解双金属表面如何影响电子结构和化学反应活性。

4. 先进的表面科学研究：能够精确表征和控制表面组成允许系统地研究表面结构如何影响催化活性等性质，为设计改进的催化剂提供宝贵的见解。

5. 催化研究：理解表面组成和结构对解释和预测催化性能至关重要，因为表面原子的排列直接影响吸附和反应过程。

这种全面的表征方法使研究人员能够建立Ni/Pt双金属系统的结构-性能关系，这对于推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要，通过为理解这些复杂双金属系统中的结构-性质关系提供坚实基础。
