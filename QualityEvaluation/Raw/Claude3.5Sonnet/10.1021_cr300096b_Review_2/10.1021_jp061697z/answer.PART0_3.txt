[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

[3] "For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). The surface compositions are monitored by measuring the Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV). This process is crucial for structural modeling and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces because it allows researchers to quantify the amount of Ni present on the surface and determine the structure of the bimetallic surface.

The researchers use the Auger ratios to estimate the onset of a monolayer coverage and distinguish between surface and subsurface structures. For example, they refer to freshly deposited Ni/Pt surfaces at 300 K as NiPtPt(111) surface structures, while surfaces heated to 600 K are referred to as PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures. This characterization enables accurate structural modeling and provides a foundation for DFT calculations to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

This process is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research as it allows for precise control and understanding of the surface composition and structure, which directly influences the catalytic properties of these materials.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过俄歇电子能谱（AES）进行的。表面组成是通过测量Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)的俄歇比来监测的。这个过程对于结构建模和理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许研究人员量化表面上存在的Ni量，并确定双金属表面的结构。

研究人员使用俄歇比来估计单层覆盖的起始点，并区分表面和亚表面结构。例如，他们将300 K下新沉积的Ni/Pt表面称为NiPtPt(111)表面结构，而加热到600 K的表面则被称为PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构。这种表征使得准确的结构建模成为可能，并为理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的DFT计算提供了基础。

这个过程对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它允许精确控制和理解表面组成和结构，这直接影响了这些材料的催化性能。
