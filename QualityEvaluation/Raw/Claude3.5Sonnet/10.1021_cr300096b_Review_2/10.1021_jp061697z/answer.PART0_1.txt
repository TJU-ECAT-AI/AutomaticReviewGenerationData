[1] "Monolayer coverage of Ni or Co was deposited onto Pt(111) from an evaporative doser, consisting of high-purity Ni or Co wire wrapped around a tungsten filament. The bimetallic structures with surface monolayer of Ni or Co were prepared with the Pt(111) crystal temperature maintained at 300 K; the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were obtained by heating to 600 K based on conditions developed in our previous studies."

[2] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[3] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[4] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a multi-step process:

1. Synthesis: Ni monolayers are deposited onto Pt(111) single crystals using an evaporative doser at 300 K. The subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is then obtained by heating to 600 K.

2. Composition analysis: The surface compositions are monitored using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), specifically tracking the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios.

3. Structural characterization: High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) is employed to identify characteristic metal-oxygen vibrational frequencies, which helps in understanding surface segregation phenomena.

4. Stability studies: AES measurements are performed at various temperatures and oxygen exposures to determine the activation barrier for transforming PtNiPt(111) to NiPtPt(111).

This comprehensive characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides accurate structural models of the bimetallic surfaces, which are essential for DFT calculations.

2. It allows for a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces.

3. It helps in studying the stability and reactivity of these bimetallic surfaces under different conditions, which is vital for catalysis research.

4. The experimental data obtained serves to validate and refine theoretical models, enhancing our overall understanding of these complex systems.

By combining these various characterization techniques, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下多步骤过程进行：

1. 合成：使用蒸发器在300 K下将Ni单层沉积到Pt(111)单晶上。然后通过加热到600 K获得亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构。

2. 成分分析：使用俄歇电子能谱(AES)监测表面成分，特别是跟踪Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比率。

3. 结构表征：采用高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS)来识别特征的金属-氧振动频率，这有助于理解表面偏析现象。

4. 稳定性研究：在不同温度和氧气暴露下进行AES测量，以确定PtNiPt(111)转变为NiPtPt(111)的活化能。

这种综合表征过程对于以下几个方面至关重要：

1. 它提供了双金属表面的精确结构模型，这对于DFT计算至关重要。

2. 它允许详细了解这些表面的电子和化学性质。

3. 它有助于研究这些双金属表面在不同条件下的稳定性和反应性，这对催化研究至关重要。
