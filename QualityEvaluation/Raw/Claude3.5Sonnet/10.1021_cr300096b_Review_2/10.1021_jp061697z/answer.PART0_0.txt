[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

[3] "For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) to monitor the surface compositions. Specifically, the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratio is used to track the Ni/Pt surface composition. The researchers have established benchmarks for interpreting these ratios, estimating that an Auger ratio of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ≈ 1.0 at 600 K corresponds to the onset of a monolayer coverage.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. Structural modeling: It allows researchers to differentiate between surface and subsurface structures. Freshly deposited Ni/Pt surfaces at 300 K are referred to as NiPtPt(111) surface structures, while those heated to 600 K are called PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures.

2. DFT calculations: Accurate structural information is essential for setting up realistic models for density functional theory calculations, ensuring that the theoretical predictions align with the actual surface configurations.

3. Understanding electronic and chemical properties: By precisely characterizing the surface structure, researchers can correlate observed properties with specific atomic arrangements, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of how the bimetallic surface influences electronic structure and chemical reactivity.

This meticulous characterization enables researchers to connect experimental observations with theoretical predictions, advancing the field of surface science and catalysis by providing a solid foundation for understanding structure-property relationships in these complex bimetallic systems.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）来监测表面组成进行的。具体来说，使用Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比来跟踪Ni/Pt表面组成。研究人员已经建立了解释这些比率的基准，估计在600 K时Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比≈1.0对应于单层覆盖的开始。

这个表征过程对于以下几个方面至关重要：

1. 结构建模：它允许研究人员区分表面和亚表面结构。在300 K下新沉积的Ni/Pt表面被称为NiPtPt(111)表面结构，而加热到600 K的表面被称为PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构。

2. DFT计算：准确的结构信息对于建立密度泛函理论计算的现实模型至关重要，确保理论预测与实际表面构型一致。

3. 理解电子和化学性质：通过精确表征表面结构，研究人员可以将观察到的性质与特定的原子排列相关联，从而更全面地理解双金属表面如何影响电子结构和化学反应活性。

这种细致的表征使研究人员能够将实验观察与理论预测联系起来，通过为理解这些复杂双金属系统中的结构-性质关系提供坚实基础，推进了表面科学和催化领域的发展。
