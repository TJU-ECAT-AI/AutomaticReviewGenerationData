[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) to monitor the surface compositions. Specifically, the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratio is used to track the Ni/Pt surface composition. The researchers have established benchmarks for interpreting these ratios, estimating that an Auger ratio of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ≈ 1.0 at 600 K corresponds to the onset of a monolayer coverage.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. Structural modeling: It allows researchers to differentiate between surface and subsurface structures. Freshly deposited Ni/Pt surfaces at 300 K are referred to as NiPtPt(111) surface structures, while those heated to 600 K are called PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures.

2. DFT calculations: Accurate structural information is essential for setting up realistic models for density functional theory calculations, ensuring that the theoretical predictions align with the actual surface configurations.

3. Understanding electronic and chemical properties: By precisely characterizing the surface structure, researchers can correlate observed properties with specific atomic arrangements, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of how the bimetallic surface influences electronic structure and chemical reactivity.

This meticulous characterization enables researchers to connect experimental observations with theoretical predictions, advancing the field of surface science and catalysis by providing a solid foundation for understanding structure-property relationships in these complex bimetallic systems.

The bimetallic structures with surface monolayer of Ni or Co were prepared with the Pt(111) crystal temperature maintained at 300 K; the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were obtained by heating to 600 K based on conditions developed in our previous studies."

[2] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[3] "HREELS measurements were performed following the adsorption of saturation coverage oxygen on clean Pt(111), a Ni film (>5 ML) on Pt(111), and PtNiPt(111). The purpose of these experiments was to identify the characteristic ν(metalO) frequencies for each surface, which will be used as an indication for the segregation of Ni from PtNiPt(111) onto the surface."

[4] "AES measurements were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time. These experiments were performed at several temperatures to estimate the activation barrier (Ea) for transforming PtNiPt(111) to a NiPtPt(111) in the presence of oxygen."
