[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "Figure 4 shows the Ni/Pt and Co/Pt AES ratios as a function of annealing temperature, after the deposition of approximately one monolayer Ni or Co on Pt(111) at 300 K."

[3] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is primarily conducted using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). This technique monitors the surface compositions by measuring the Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV). The process involves depositing approximately one monolayer of Ni on Pt(111) at 300 K and then annealing the surface at various temperatures. The Auger ratios are measured as a function of annealing temperature to track the diffusion of Ni atoms into the Pt substrate.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. Structural modeling: It provides information about the distribution of Ni atoms on and within the Pt substrate at different temperatures, allowing researchers to model the surface and subsurface structures accurately.

2. DFT calculations: The experimental data on surface composition and structure serve as inputs and validation points for density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ensuring that theoretical models accurately represent real surfaces.

3. Understanding electronic and chemical properties: By correlating the surface composition with other measurements (e.g., reactivity studies), researchers can gain insights into how the arrangement of Ni and Pt atoms affects the electronic structure and chemical behavior of the bimetallic surface.

4. Quantification of surface coverage: The Auger ratios allow researchers to estimate the onset of monolayer coverage, which is essential for comparing different surfaces and ensuring consistency in experiments.

This comprehensive characterization approach enables researchers to establish structure-property relationships in Ni/Pt bimetallic systems, which is fundamental for advancing surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要通过俄歇电子能谱（AES）进行。该技术通过测量Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)的俄歇比来监测表面组成。这个过程包括在300 K温度下在Pt(111)上沉积约一个单层的Ni，然后在不同温度下退火。通过测量不同退火温度下的俄歇比，可以追踪Ni原子向Pt基底扩散的情况。

这种表征过程之所以重要，原因如下：

1. 结构建模：它提供了不同温度下Ni原子在Pt基底表面和内部分布的信息，使研究人员能够准确地建立表面和亚表面结构模型。

2. DFT计算：表面组成和结构的实验数据可以作为密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的输入和验证点，确保理论模型准确地代表实际表面。

3. 理解电子和化学性质：通过将表面组成与其他测量结果（如反应性研究）相关联，研究人员可以深入了解Ni和Pt原子的排列如何影响双金属表面的电子结构和化学行为。

4. 表面覆盖率量化：俄歇比允许研究人员估算单层覆盖的起始点，这对于比较不同表面和确保实验的一致性至关重要。

这种全面的表征方法使研究人员能够建立Ni/Pt双金属系统的结构-性能关系，这对于推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
