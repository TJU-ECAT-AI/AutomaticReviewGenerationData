[1] "The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively."

[2] "After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0."

[3] "For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) to monitor the surface compositions. The Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratio is used to quantify the relative amounts of Ni and Pt on the surface. This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. Structural modeling: It allows researchers to determine the arrangement of Ni and Pt atoms on the surface and in subsurface layers. By monitoring the Auger ratios at different temperatures, they can identify when Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface, forming distinct structures like NiPtPt(111) at 300 K or PtNiPt(111) at 600 K.

2. DFT calculations: Accurate structural information obtained from AES measurements provides a basis for constructing realistic models for density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This enables researchers to predict electronic properties and reactivity of these bimetallic surfaces more accurately.

3. Understanding electronic and chemical properties: By correlating the surface composition with other experimental measurements (e.g., reactivity studies), researchers can gain insights into how the arrangement of Ni and Pt atoms influences the electronic structure and chemical behavior of the bimetallic surface.

4. Advanced surface science research: The ability to precisely characterize and control the surface composition allows for systematic studies of how surface structure affects properties like catalytic activity, providing valuable insights for designing improved catalysts.

5. Catalysis research: Understanding the surface composition and structure is essential for explaining and predicting catalytic performance, as the arrangement of atoms at the surface directly influences adsorption and reaction processes.

This comprehensive characterization approach enables researchers to establish structure-property relationships for Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is fundamental for advancing surface science and developing more effective catalysts for various applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）来监测表面组成进行的。Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比率被用来量化表面Ni和Pt的相对含量。这个表征过程之所以至关重要，原因如下：

1. 结构建模：它使研究人员能够确定表面和亚表面层中Ni和Pt原子的排列。通过监测不同温度下的俄歇比率，他们可以识别Ni原子何时扩散到亚表面，形成不同的结构，如300 K时的NiPtPt(111)或600 K时的PtNiPt(111)。

2. DFT计算：从AES测量获得的准确结构信息为构建密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的现实模型提供了基础。这使研究人员能够更准确地预测这些双金属表面的电子性质和反应活性。

3. 理解电子和化学性质：通过将表面组成与其他实验测量（如反应活性研究）相关联，研究人员可以深入了解Ni和Pt原子的排列如何影响双金属表面的电子结构和化学行为。

4. 先进的表面科学研究：能够精确表征和控制表面组成允许系统地研究表面结构如何影响催化活性等性质，为设计改进的催化剂提供宝贵的见解。

5. 催化研究：理解表面组成和结构对解释和预测催化性能至关重要，因为表面原子的排列直接影响吸附和反应过程。

这种全面的表征方法使研究人员能够建立Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构-性能关系，这对推进表面科学和开发更有效的催化剂用于各种应用至关重要。
