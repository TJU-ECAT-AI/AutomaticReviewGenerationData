[1] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[2] "Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)."

[3] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations and experimental studies to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[4] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This process involves:

1. Preparation of the bimetallic surface by depositing Ni on Pt(111) or Pt on Ni(111).

2. Confirmation of the surface structure, particularly the preference for Ni atoms to occupy subsurface sites at monolayer coverage, making Pt the topmost layer.

3. Theoretical calculations to understand the electronic properties, specifically the shift in the d-band center of surface Pt atoms due to interaction with subsurface Ni.

4. Experimental studies to verify the unique chemical properties, such as reduced adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefins compared to pure Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.

This characterization process is crucial because it provides a comprehensive understanding of the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. It allows for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which are essential for predicting and explaining the novel catalytic properties of these surfaces. This approach combines theoretical predictions with experimental validation, enabling researchers to design and optimize bimetallic catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过理论计算和实验研究的结合进行的。这个过程包括：

1. 通过在Pt(111)上沉积Ni或在Ni(111)上沉积Pt来制备双金属表面。

2. 确认表面结构，特别是在单层覆盖时Ni原子倾向于占据亚表面位置，使Pt成为最外层。

3. 进行理论计算以理解电子性质，特别是由于与亚表面Ni的相互作用而导致的表面Pt原子d带中心的移动。

4. 进行实验研究以验证独特的化学性质，如与纯Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面相比，氢和烯烃的吸附能降低。

这个表征过程至关重要，因为它提供了对Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构、电子和化学性质的全面理解。它允许进行准确的结构建模和DFT计算，这对于预测和解释这些表面的新型催化性质至关重要。这种方法将理论预测与实验验证相结合，使研究人员能够设计和优化具有特定应用的定制性质的双金属催化剂，用于先进的表面科学和催化研究。
