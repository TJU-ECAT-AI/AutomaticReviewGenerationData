[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4], [5] and experimental studies [6], [8], [9], [16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."
