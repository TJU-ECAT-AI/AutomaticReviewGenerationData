[1] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[2] "Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)."

[3] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations and experimental studies to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This process involves:

1. Synthesis: Depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates.

2. Structural analysis: Confirming that at monolayer coverage, Ni atoms preferentially occupy subsurface sites of Pt(111), with Pt remaining as the top-most surface layer.

3. Theoretical modeling: Performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the electronic structure and predict chemical properties.

4. Experimental verification: Conducting surface science experiments to confirm theoretical predictions and investigate chemical properties.

This comprehensive characterization process is crucial because:

1. It provides accurate structural models for DFT calculations, ensuring reliable predictions of electronic and chemical properties.

2. It helps establish the relationship between surface structure and chemical reactivity, which is essential for understanding catalytic behavior.

3. It allows researchers to identify and explain the unique properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces compared to their parent metals.

4. It contributes to the development of rational catalyst design principles based on the correlation between electronic structure and chemical properties.

5. It advances our understanding of how bimetallic surfaces can be tailored to achieve desired catalytic properties, which is vital for developing more efficient and selective catalysts in various applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过理论计算和实验研究的结合进行的。这个过程包括：

1. 合成：在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。

2. 结构分析：确认在单层覆盖度下，Ni原子优先占据Pt(111)的亚表面位置，Pt仍然作为最外层表面。

3. 理论建模：进行密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，以理解电子结构并预测化学性质。

4. 实验验证：进行表面科学实验以确认理论预测并研究化学性质。
