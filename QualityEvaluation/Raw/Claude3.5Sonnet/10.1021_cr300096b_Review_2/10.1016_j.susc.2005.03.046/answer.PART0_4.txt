[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4], [5] and experimental studies [6], [8], [9], [16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves both theoretical calculations and experimental studies. The process confirms that at monolayer coverage, Ni atoms position themselves below the topmost layer of the Pt(111) surface. This structural arrangement causes a shift in the d-band center of surface Pt atoms away from the Fermi level, resulting in reduced adsorption energy for hydrogen and olefins compared to pure Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides accurate structural models for the bimetallic surface, essential for DFT calculations.

2. It helps explain the unique chemical properties observed on these surfaces.

3. It allows for a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure modifications induced by the bimetallic arrangement.

4. It enables researchers to correlate the surface structure with observed catalytic behaviors.

5. It aids in predicting and designing bimetallic surfaces with specific properties for catalysis applications.

By combining theoretical and experimental approaches, researchers can develop a more complete picture of the Ni/Pt bimetallic system, advancing our understanding of surface science and catalysis at the atomic level.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及理论计算和实验研究。该过程确认在单层覆盖率下，Ni原子位于Pt(111)表面的最顶层之下。这种结构安排导致表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级，与纯Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面相比，氢气和烯烃的吸附能降低。

这个表征过程至关重要，原因如下：

1. 它为双金属表面提供了准确的结构模型，这对DFT计算至关重要。

2. 它有助于解释这些表面上观察到的独特化学性质。

3. 它允许全面理解双金属排列引起的电子结构修饰。

4. 它使研究人员能够将表面结构与观察到的催化行为相关联。

5. 它有助于预测和设计具有特定催化应用性质的双金属表面。

通过结合理论和实验方法，研究人员可以对Ni/Pt双金属系统形成更完整的认识，从原子水平推进我们对表面科学和催化作用的理解。
