          [1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4], [5] and experimental studies [6], [8], [9], [16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

[3] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[4] "Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This process involves:

1. Preparation: Depositing Ni on Pt(111) or Pt on Ni(111) to create the bimetallic surface.

2. Structural analysis: Confirming that at monolayer coverage, Ni atoms preferentially occupy subsurface sites of Pt(111), with Pt remaining as the top-most surface layer.

3. Theoretical modeling: Performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the electronic structure and predict chemical properties.

4. Experimental verification: Conducting surface science experiments to confirm theoretical predictions and investigate chemical properties.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides accurate structural models for DFT calculations, ensuring reliable predictions of electronic and chemical properties.

2. It helps explain the unique chemical properties observed on these surfaces, such as reduced adsorption energy for hydrogen and olefins compared to pure Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.

3. It allows for a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure modifications induced by the bimetallic arrangement, particularly the shift in the d-band center of surface Pt atoms.

4. It enables researchers to correlate the surface structure with observed catalytic behaviors, advancing our understanding of how bimetallic surfaces can be tailored for specific catalytic properties.

5. It contributes to the development of rational catalyst design principles based on the correlation between electronic structure and chemical properties.

By combining theoretical and experimental approaches, researchers can develop a more complete picture of the Ni/Pt bimetallic system, advancing our understanding of surface science and catalysis at the atomic level. This comprehensive approach is essential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for various applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成，是通过理论计算和实验研究的结合进行的。这个过程包括：

1. 准备：在Pt(111)上沉积Ni或在Ni(111)上沉积Pt来创建双金属表面。

2. 结构分析：确认在单层覆盖度下，Ni原子优先占据Pt(111)的亚表面位置，Pt仍然作为最外层表面。

3. 理论建模：进行密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，以理解电子结构并预测化学性质。

4. 实验验证：进行表面科学实验以确认理论预测并研究化学性质。

这个表征过程至关重要，原因如下：

1. 它为DFT计算提供了准确的结构模型，确保了电子和化学性质预测的可靠性。

2. 它有助于解释这些表面上观察到的独特化学性质，如与纯Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面相比，氢和烯烃的吸附能降低。

3. 它允许全面理解双金属排列引起的电子结构修饰，特别是表面Pt原子的d带中心的移动。

4. 它使研究人员能够将表面结构与观察到的催化行为相关联，提高我们对如何调整双金属表面以实现特定催化性质的理解。

5. 它有助于基于电子结构和化学性质之间的相关性开发理性催化剂设计原则。

通过结合理论和实验方法，研究人员可以对Ni/Pt双金属系统形成更完整的认识，从原子水平推进我们对表面科学和催化作用的理解。这种全面的方法对于在先进的表面科学和催化研究中开发更高效和选择性的催化剂至关重要。
