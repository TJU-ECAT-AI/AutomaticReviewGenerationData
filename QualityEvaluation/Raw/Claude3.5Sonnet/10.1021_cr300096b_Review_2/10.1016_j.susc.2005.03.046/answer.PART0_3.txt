[1] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[2] "Similar to many Pt-3d alloy systems, at monolayer coverage Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(1 1 1), making Pt the top-most surface layer in both ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1)."

[3] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations and experimental studies to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[4] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This process involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. 

The studies have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer coverage, Ni atoms prefer to occupy the subsurface sites of Pt(111), making Pt the top-most surface layer. This structural arrangement is crucial for understanding the unique properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

The process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it reveals the specific atomic arrangement of the bimetallic surface. This information is essential for accurate theoretical predictions of surface properties and reactivity.

Furthermore, this characterization process is vital for understanding the electronic properties of these surfaces. It has been found that due to the interaction with subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level. This shift leads to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefins compared to pure Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.

This comprehensive understanding of both the structural and electronic properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows researchers to explain and predict the unique catalytic properties of these surfaces, such as their ability to promote low-temperature hydrogenation of olefins. This knowledge can be applied to the rational design of more efficient catalysts for various chemical processes.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过理论计算和实验研究的结合进行的。这个过程涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。

研究已经证实，在大约一个单层覆盖度时，Ni原子倾向于占据Pt(111)的亚表面位置，使Pt成为最外层表面。这种结构安排对于理解这些双金属表面的独特性质至关重要。

这个过程对结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它揭示了双金属表面的具体原子排列。这些信息对于准确预测表面性质和反应性的理论计算是必不可少的。

此外，这个表征过程对理解这些表面的电子性质也至关重要。研究发现，由于与亚表面Ni的相互作用，表面Pt原子的d带中心远离费米能级。这种移动导致氢气和烯烃的吸附能compared to纯Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面降低。

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构和电子性质的全面理解对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。它使研究人员能够解释和预测这些表面的独特催化性质，例如它们促进烯烃低温加氢的能力。这些知识可以应用于各种化学过程中更高效催化剂的合理设计。
