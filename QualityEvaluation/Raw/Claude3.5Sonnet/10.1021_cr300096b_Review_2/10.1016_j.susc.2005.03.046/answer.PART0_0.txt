[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4], [5] and experimental studies [6], [8], [9], [16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces. These have confirmed that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top-most layer of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."

[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves both theoretical calculations and experimental studies. The process typically includes:

1. Structural modeling: Confirming the position of Ni atoms in the Pt(111) surface, which reside below the top-most layer at monolayer coverage.

2. DFT calculations: Analyzing the electronic structure, particularly the shift in the d-band center of surface Pt atoms due to interaction with subsurface Ni.

3. Experimental studies: Conducting various surface science techniques to verify theoretical predictions and understand chemical properties.

This comprehensive approach is crucial because it allows researchers to:

1. Determine the origin of unique chemical properties observed in Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.

2. Understand how the structural arrangement affects electronic properties, such as the shift in d-band center.

3. Correlate electronic structure changes with observed chemical behavior, like reduced adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefins.

4. Validate theoretical predictions with experimental results, ensuring a more accurate understanding of the system.

5. Develop a fundamental understanding that can be applied to rational catalyst design and other advanced applications in surface science and catalysis research.

This multi-faceted characterization process provides a robust framework for understanding the complex interplay between structure, electronic properties, and chemical behavior in bimetallic systems, which is essential for advancing the field of surface science and catalysis.
