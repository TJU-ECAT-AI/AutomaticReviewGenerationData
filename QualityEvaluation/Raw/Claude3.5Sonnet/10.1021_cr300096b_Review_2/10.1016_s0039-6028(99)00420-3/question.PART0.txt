Response and enhancement of surface magneto-optic Kerr effect for CoPt(111) ultrathin films and surface alloy
Abstract
Magnetic anisotropy as a function of Co coverage was comparatively studied on a flat and sputtered Pt(111) surface by a surface magneto-optic Kerr effect. The magnetic anisotropy of the flat Pt(111) surface changes gradually from out-of-plane to in-plane when the film thickness is over four monolayers, whereas both the out-of-plane and in-plane anisotropy occur on the sputtered Pt(111) surface. This difference is attributed to the fact that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is diminished from the sputtered surface. A large enhancement in the polar magneto-optic Kerr signal was observed after one atomic layer of Co adatoms on the flat Pt(111) surface was annealed at 710 K. The formation of CoPt alloy at the interface following the enhancement was confirmed by low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy. The mechanism of the enhancement is discussed.
CoPt systems are very promising candidates for the magneto-optic (MO) recording media because these systems have a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high coercivity and large MO Kerr signal

. We studied the magnetic properties of ultrathin Co/Pt(111) films and CoPt surface alloy by using a surface MO Kerr effect (SMOKE). An enhancement in the polar Kerr signal was observed for one monolayer (ML) of Co/Pt(111) in the process of surface alloy formation. When the formation of CoPt alloy has been developed at 710 K, the maximum enhancement before the correction in incidence reflectivity is about three times that of the signal before annealing.
Experiments were conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with a background pressure in the range of 1010 Torr. The UHV chamber was equipped with instruments for low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and in situ SMOKE measurements. The Pt(111) surface was cleaned by means of Ar-ion bombardment and subsequent annealing cycles. The kinetic energy of Ar ions employed for the etching was 2.1 keV. The annealing temperature was as high as 1050 K. The sputteringannealing cycles were continued until a well-ordered p(1×1) LEED pattern with bright, sharp spots and a low background was observed. To remove the residual carbon, the sample was heated to 870 K in an oxygen pressure of 5×107 Torr before sputtering. The chemical impurity on the surface was checked by means of AES. The growth rate of the cobalt overlayer was determined by LEED intensity oscillation and Auger signals versus time plots
[7]
. The thickness of Co overlayer was double checked by a quartz balance thickness monitor. A HeNe laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm was used as the light source for the SMOKE measurement. A rotating electromagnet within the UHV chamber was used to provide the magnetic field. This could be applied parallel or perpendicular to the film surface for the longitudinal or the polar Kerr-effect configurations respectively. The maximum magnetic field obtained was 950 Oe.
The Kerr signals versus the magnetic field of Co ultrathin films on the flat Pt(111) surface grown at room temperature are shown in
Fig. 1a
. The measurement was performed at room temperature. In the initial stage of the Co growth with film thickness of 0.8 and 2.2 monolayers (ML), hysteresis occurs only in the polar configuration. The easy axis of the magnetization is out-of-plane, i.e. the Co film exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This is because the lowered symmetry of the surface strongly modifies the magnetocrystalline anisotropy when compared with the bulk, yielding the so-called surface anisotropy
[8]
. It was predicted theoretically that 1 ML Co/Pt(111) shows perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
[9]
. Experimentally, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy was observed by magnetic circular X-ray dichroism in the initial stage of growth of ultrathin Co/Pt(111) films above a thickness of 1.8 ML up to 5 ML
[10]
. However, to our knowledge, our result is the first experimental observation of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a submonolayer of Co on Pt(111) without a Pt capped layer. As the film thickness increases to 4.4 ML, both longitudinal and polar hysteresis loops appear. As the film thickness increases to 6.5 ML only the longitudinal hysteresis loop was observed and the anisotropy was completely in-plane. This is attributed to the increase of shape anisotropy caused by the dipolar interaction

The thickness dependence of the saturated Kerr intensities for the Co/Pt(111) is shown in
Fig. 1b
. Only the polar Kerr intensity was observed when the coverage of Co was less than 3.7 ML. The Co films exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which was also observed in the Co/Au(111) film
[12]
. From our LEED observation, Co films show an incoherent epitaxy
[7]
. The growth of the Co overlayer tends to be layer-by-layer. In such a film, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is strong. This anisotropy causes the out-of-plane easy axis of magnetization. As the Co thickness increases between 4.5 and 5.8 ML, the Kerr intensities appear in both the longitudinal and the polar configurations. From LEED and AES observations, the growth of the Co overlayers tends to be three-dimensional island growth
[7]
. The coverage of the Co films is not uniform and the surface anisotropy is no longer dominant. Therefore, both the longitudinal and the polar Kerr signals occur. When more Co atoms were deposited, the polar Kerr intensity vanished and only the longitudinal one persisted. The easy axis of magnetization was observed to be in-plane. This is attributed to the fact that the shape anisotropy is dominant for thick films. The magnetic anisotropy changes from the out-of-plane orientation to the in-plane orientation when the thickness of the film increases.
To study the effect of a rough surface on magnetic properties, we monitored the thickness dependence of the Kerr signals on a sputtered Pt(111) surface. The results are shown in
Fig. 2
. Argon ions with a kinetic energy of 1.6 keV were used to sputter a well-ordered Pt(111) surface for 5 min. The Pt(111) surface is rough and has many steps when the surface is sputtered at a temperature below 550 K
[13]
. The LEED spots became dimmer after the Co atoms were deposited on the sputtered Pt(111) surface. The Co film shows three-dimensional island growth. The Kerr signals occur in both the longitudinal and the polar configurations when the Co thickness is between 0.7 and 7.0 ML, as shown in
Fig. 2a
. The disappearance of perpendicular uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in
Fig. 2
compared with
Fig. 1
is attributed to the fact that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy has diminished. This phenomenon results from the absence of a crystalline structure in the Co film deposited on a rough surface. In addition, the sputtered Pt(111) surface contains micro-facets that may cause complicated orientations for the Co islands. This is another possibility for the appearance of the Kerr signals in both the longitudinal and the polar configurations. The Kerr intensities as a function of Co thickness are depicted in
Fig. 2b
. As the Co thickness increases to over 8 ML, only the longitudinal Kerr intensity persists and the easy axis of magnetization is in-plane.

Fig. 2. (a) The Kerr signals versus magnetic field; (b) thickness dependence of the saturated Kerr intensities for Co films deposited on a sputtered Pt(111) surface. Both longitudinal and polar Kerr signals occur for a Co thickness between 0.7 and 7 ML.
The temperature dependence of the saturated Kerr intensities in the longitudinal and the polar configurations for 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface grown at 325 K is shown in
Fig. 3
. The Kerr intensities were measured after the sample temperature was in equilibrium and persisted for 3 min at each temperature. The Kerr intensity only occurred in the polar configuration when 1 ML Co was deposited on the flat Pt(111) surface at room temperature. It shows perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We did not observe any longitudinal Kerr intensity in the heating process up to 625 K and the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy was thermally stable. The polar Kerr intensity decreases as the sample temperature increases. It vanishes after the temperature is above 625 K. It is interesting that a plateau on the curve occurs between 500 and 575 K. From mean field theory, the saturated magnetization versus the sample temperature is a smooth function that decreases monotonically when the temperature increases
[14]
. An analytical treatment of the magnetic phase transformation predicts that the magnetization approaches zero according to a simple power law M(TTc)β
[15]
,
[16]
. Our observation of the plateau between 500 and 575 K shows an unusual behavior. From the trend of the curve for the Kerr intensity versus sample temperature, an enhancement in the Kerr signal is implied.

Fig. 3. Temperature dependence of the saturated Kerr intensities in both the longitudinal and polar configurations for 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface. The polar Kerr intensity decreases as sample temperature increases and it vanishes at 623 K.
To identify the enhancement in the Kerr signal, the temperature dependencies of the Kerr signals versus the magnetic field were monitored in the longitudinal and the polar configurations after annealing the 1 ML of Co on the flat Pt(111) surface. The results are shown in
Fig. 4a
. The ultrathin Co/Pt(111) film was annealed at each selected temperature for 5 min followed by cooling to 325 K. The Kerr signals were then measured at 325 K after the annealing. Hysteresis occurs only in the polar configuration. After annealing the sample at 710 K, the hysteresis persists in the polar configuration. Moreover, a large enhancement in the remanence is observed and the shape of the hysteresis loop becomes a perfect square. The hysteresis loop vanishes after a subsequent annealing at 850 K. The saturated Kerr intensities of the longitudinal and the polar configurations as a function of the annealing temperature are depicted in
Fig. 4b
. Note that all Kerr intensities were measured at 325 K after the annealing. The enhancement in the polar Kerr signal starts at 500 K. The maximum enhancement of the Kerr signal is as large as 300% at 710 K. The Kerr intensity vanishes as the temperature rises above 850 K.

Fig. 4. The annealing effects of 1 ML Co on the flat Pt(111) surface: (a) temperature dependencies of the hysteresis loops for saturated Kerr intensities; (b) temperature dependencies of Kerr intensities for both the polar and longitudinal configurations; (c) normalized Auger signal ratio (ICo53/IPt237) after alloy formation. The Kerr intensities and Auger spectra were measured at 325 K after each annealing. A large enhancement in the polar Kerr signal was observed after annealing at 710 K for 5 min.
Since Auger electrons are sensitive to the depth of diffusion for an adsorbate, AES was used to monitor the change in the composition of the surface layers after annealing.
Fig. 4c
shows the normalized Auger signal ratio of Co (53 eV) to Pt (237 eV) ICo53/IPt237 versus the annealing temperature. The trend in the Auger signal ratio in
Fig. 4c
is consistent with our result for the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) deposited at 170 K, where Co atoms diffuse into the Pt(111) surface at temperatures above 400 K
[17]
. The Auger signal ratio decreases monotonously with the temperature in the annealing process. This fact represents that the Co adatoms diffuse into the Pt(111) substrate and the formation of a CoPt alloy has been developed
[5]
,
[18]
. Comparing
Fig. 4b and c
, both the polar Kerr intensity and the Auger signal ratio change rapidly at temperatures between 500 and 600 K. These results indicate that the large enhancement in the Kerr signal is strongly correlated to the formation of a CoPt alloy. As the annealing temperature becomes greater than 710 K, the Co atoms become a dilute impurity in Pt. The Kerr signal decreases monotonously. As the annealing temperature reaches 850 K, the ratio of the Auger signals decreases to zero. The Co atoms are almost completely diffused into Pt. No magnetic domain persists and the corresponding Kerr intensity vanishes. However, no longitudinal Kerr signal was observed in each annealing process. This fact indicates that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy always persists until it vanishes after the annealing at high temperatures. The CoPt surface alloy that is formed from annealing 1 ML Co on the flat Pt(111) surface still exhibits a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy before the Co atoms are completely dissolved.
The enhancement in the Kerr intensity of CoPt alloying thin films has been studied before. Brandle et al.
[19]
investigated the reflectivity R, and the polar Kerr rotation θk, of evaporated Co1xPtx at different contents of x with a thickness over 1000 Å in the photon energy range between 0.8 and 5 eV. They found that the maximum polar Kerr rotation occurs at x=0.5 with a photon energy of 4.2 eV. Weller et al.
[20]
further compared the static MO signal R(θ2k+ε2k), of Co/Pt multilayers and alloys (where εk is the Kerr ellipticity). An overall 50% enhancement in the case of alloys was observed. In our case, the maximum enhancement of the polar Kerr intensity is as large as 300% before the correction for the different reflectivities of Co and CoPt alloy. The reflectivities of Co and Pt are 0.66 and 0.75 respectively when a photon energy of 2.0 eV (HeNe laser wavelength of 632.8 nm) is used
[19]
. The reflectivity of the CoPt alloy must be between these values. Therefore, the normalized enhancement of the MO signal R(θ2k+ε2k) is about 200% in our case. It is a significant enhancement.
The mechanism of the enhancement in the Kerr signal is interesting. Weller et al.
[20]
suggested that it is attributed to the enhanced 3D-exchange in alloys compared with multilayers or a monolayer, where Pt atoms are polarized across the interface by neighboring Co atoms in the 2D exchange. Recently, the hybridization of the electronic states in the formation of the CoPt surface alloy was proposed. It has been proved that the hybridization of the Pt and Mn atomic levels causes the Mn atomic magnetic moment increase to 3.17 μB (Bohr magneton)
[21]
. The other possible reason for the enhancement is the exceptionally large spinorbit coupling of Co atoms in the CoPt alloy state
[22]
.
The origin of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in CoPt alloying films is especially interesting. It is present in both epitaxial CoPt alloy films for a broad range of alloy compositions
[19]
,
[20]
and in polycrystalline alloy films grown on amorphous substrates
[23]
. The X-ray-absorption fine structure (XAFS) studies of CoPt alloy thin films suggested that the segregation of Co into monolayer-thick, in-plane platelets, or discontinuous sheets of Co leads to the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
[23]
. The 2D clusters of Co parallel to the film plane and the internal interfaces are the origin of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the CoPt alloying thin films. In our case of 1 ML Co ultrathin film, the formation of nonlinear chains of Co leads to the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy after the CoPt alloying.
The enhancement of 2 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface annealed at 710 K is the same as that of 1 ML. However, both the longitudinal and the polar hysteresis loops occur after it is annealed at 850 K. The enhancement of the response of the Kerr signal exists in other coverages once the CoPt alloy is formed at the interface, but the in-plane hysteresis 1oops always appear at a higher annealing temperature.
In summary, the magnetic anisotropy of Co/Pt(111) was studied by SMOKE. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy appears for Co deposited on a flat Pt(111) surface with a thickness between 0.8 and 3.7 ML. The perpendicular uniaxial magnetic anisotropy disappears for Co deposited on a sputtered Pt(111) surface because the magnetocrystalline anisotropy has diminished due to the absence of crystalline structure in the films. During surface alloy formation in 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface, we quantitatively demonstrate an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal. The maximum enhancement in MO signal is as large as 200% after alloy formation at 710 K. The formation of CoPt alloy was confirmed by AES and LEED. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy persists in the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K. The enhancement is also observed in thicker films when the formation of CoPt alloy has been developed, but both the out-of-plane and the in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature.
