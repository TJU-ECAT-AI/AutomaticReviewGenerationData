Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces have garnered significant attention in advanced surface science and catalysis research due to their unique properties and potential applications. The synthesis of these surfaces involves various methods, including co-deposition, sequential deposition, and alloying techniques, each offering distinct advantages in controlling the composition and structure of the resulting material. Structural modeling of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces employs advanced computational techniques, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations, to predict and analyze the atomic arrangements and interactions between the two metals. These models are crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, including charge transfer, d-band center shifts, and surface reactivity. Comprehensive characterization of these surfaces involves a combination of experimental techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), which provide valuable insights into the surface composition, morphology, and reactivity. The synergistic effects between Ni and Pt often result in enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts, making Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces promising candidates for various applications, including fuel cells, heterogeneous catalysis, and electrochemical sensors. By thoroughly investigating these surfaces, researchers can develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing bimetallic systems and engineer more efficient catalysts for future technological advancements.
