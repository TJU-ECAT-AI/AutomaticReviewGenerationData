[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "Although we observe Ni atoms incorporated in the Pt terraces, it is clear that exchange is favored at step sites. In fact, the steps appear already saturated (2×1 superstructure) with Ni at 150 K."

[4] "Deposition at T=300 K leads to the formation of a 2×2 alloy on the Pt terraces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at various temperatures. This process is crucial because it reveals unexpected behaviors in the Ni/Pt system, such as the exchange of Ni atoms with Pt substrate atoms even at low temperatures (150 K), the formation of surface alloys, and the development of ordered structures depending on temperature and deposition sites.

The study shows that contrary to previous assumptions of pseudomorphic growth, Ni atoms readily exchange with Pt atoms on both terrace and step sites of the Pt(9 9 7) surface. This exchange process is favored at step sites, leading to a 2x1 superstructure at 150 K. At higher temperatures (300 K), a 2x2 alloy forms on the terraces.

These findings are critical for structural modeling and DFT calculations as they provide a more accurate picture of the actual surface structure and composition. Understanding these exchange processes and the resulting alloy formations is essential for comprehending the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which have significant implications for catalysis research and other applications in surface science.

The study demonstrates the importance of detailed, temperature-dependent investigations in revealing complex surface phenomena that might be overlooked in simpler models or assumptions. This comprehensive understanding is vital for accurately predicting and tailoring the properties of bimetallic surfaces for various applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）在不同温度下进行的。这个过程非常重要，因为它揭示了Ni/Pt系统中意想不到的行为，比如即使在低温（150 K）下Ni原子也会与Pt基底原子交换，形成表面合金，以及根据温度和沉积位置形成有序结构。

研究表明，与先前假设的赝同形生长相反，Ni原子在Pt(9 9 7)表面的台阶和台阶位置都容易与Pt原子交换。这种交换过程在台阶位置更容易发生，导致在150 K时形成2x1超结构。在更高的温度（300 K）下，在台阶上形成2x2合金。

这些发现对结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算至关重要，因为它们提供了更准确的实际表面结构和成分图像。理解这些交换过程和由此产生的合金形成对于理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，这对催化研究和表面科学的其他应用有重要意义。

该研究表明，详细的、依赖温度的调查对于揭示可能在更简单的模型或假设中被忽视的复杂表面现象的重要性。这种全面的理解对于准确预测和调整双金属表面的性质以用于先进表面科学和催化研究的各种应用至关重要。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at various temperatures. This process is crucial because it reveals unexpected behaviors that differ from previous understanding. 

Specifically, the study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms at temperatures as low as 150 K, both at terrace and step sites, forming a surface alloy. This is in contrast to earlier findings that suggested pseudomorphic growth of Ni on Pt(111) at room temperature. 

The research demonstrates that the structure and composition of the surface alloy depend on temperature and coverage. At 300 K, a 2×2 substitutional alloy forms with a Ni20Pt80 composition in the topmost layer.

These detailed observations are essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations. They provide a more comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study highlights the importance of considering temperature-dependent alloying processes when investigating these systems.

通过在不同温度下使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）来表征通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni而合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面。这个过程至关重要，因为它揭示了与先前理解不同的意外行为。

具体来说，研究表明Ni原子在低至150 K的温度下就与Pt原子交换，无论是在台阶还是台阶位置，形成表面合金。这与早期发现的Ni在室温下在Pt(111)上赝态生长的结论形成对比。

研究表明，表面合金的结构和成分取决于温度和覆盖度。在300 K时，形成了一个2×2的取代型合金，最外层的成分为Ni20Pt80。

这些详细的观察对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。它们为理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质提供了更全面的认识，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。该研究强调了在研究这些系统时考虑温度依赖的合金化过程的重要性。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is primarily conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) in this study. The researchers use a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus to examine the submonolayer growth of Ni on a Pt(9 9 7) surface. The Pt substrate is carefully prepared through cycles of ion sputtering, annealing, and oxygen exposure.

This process is crucial for structural modeling and our understanding of these bimetallic surfaces because it reveals unexpected behaviors in the Ni/Pt system. Unlike previous studies on Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, which showed pseudomorphic growth of Ni at room temperature, this study demonstrates that on Pt(9 9 7), Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms even at temperatures as low as 150 K, forming a surface alloy.

These findings are important for DFT calculations and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt surfaces because they show that the actual structure of these bimetallic surfaces can be significantly different from what might be expected based on simple deposition models. The exchange process and alloy formation observed at various temperatures provide crucial information for accurately modeling these surfaces in catalysis research and other applications in advanced surface science.

在这项研究中，主要使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征。研究人员使用自制的低温STM装置来检查Ni在Pt(9 9 7)表面上的亚单层生长。Pt基底通过离子溅射、退火和氧气暴露的循环过程进行仔细准备。

这个过程对结构建模和我们理解这些双金属表面至关重要，因为它揭示了Ni/Pt系统中意想不到的行为。与之前在Pt(1 1 1)表面上的研究不同，后者显示Ni在室温下呈赝同型生长，而本研究表明，在Pt(9 9 7)上，即使在低至150 K的温度下，Ni原子也会与Pt原子交换，形成表面合金。

这些发现对密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和理解Ni/Pt表面的电子和化学性质很重要，因为它们表明这些双金属表面的实际结构可能与基于简单沉积模型预期的结构有显著不同。在不同温度下观察到的交换过程和合金形成为催化研究和其他高级表面科学应用中准确建模这些表面提供了关键信息。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is primarily conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This technique allows for atomic-scale imaging of the surface, revealing crucial information about the growth mode, atomic arrangement, and alloying behavior of Ni on Pt.

The study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms even at low temperatures (150 K), both at terrace and step sites. This exchange process leads to the formation of a surface alloy, rather than a simple overlayer structure. The composition and ordering of this alloy depend on the deposition temperature and coverage.

At 150 K, irregular monolayer islands are observed, along with Ni atoms embedded in the Pt surface. As the temperature increases to 300 K, a more ordered 2×2 substitutional alloy forms, with a Ni20Pt80 composition in the topmost layer.

This detailed structural characterization is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides a foundation for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which require precise knowledge of atomic positions and compositions.

2. It reveals the complex interplay between Ni and Pt atoms, including exchange processes and alloy formation, which significantly influence the electronic and chemical properties of the surface.

3. It helps explain discrepancies with previous studies on Pt(111), highlighting the importance of surface structure (e.g., steps) in determining growth behavior.

4. The information on temperature-dependent alloying and ordering is vital for understanding and controlling the surface composition in catalysis applications.

This comprehensive understanding of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface structure is essential for explaining and predicting its electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties, which are central to advanced surface science and catalysis research.
