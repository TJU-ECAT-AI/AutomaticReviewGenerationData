[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Deposition of 0.2 ML Ni at T=300 K results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer."

[3] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[4] "At T=150 K, Fig. 1 (a), we observe the nucleation of irregular monolayer islands that grow with one side attached to the ascending step edge. We also observe a large number of bright round spots that appear about 0.4 Å higher than the surrounding Pt. These features represent Ni atoms embedded in Pt, as shown by Schmid et al. in an STM study of the Pt25Ni75(1 1 1) surface [15]."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is primarily conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This technique allows for atomic-scale imaging of the surface, revealing crucial information about the growth mode, atomic arrangement, and alloying behavior of Ni on Pt.

The study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms even at low temperatures (150 K), both at terrace and step sites. This exchange process leads to the formation of a surface alloy, rather than a simple overlayer structure. The composition and ordering of this alloy depend on the deposition temperature and coverage.

At 150 K, irregular monolayer islands are observed, along with Ni atoms embedded in the Pt surface. As the temperature increases to 300 K, a more ordered 2×2 substitutional alloy forms, with a Ni20Pt80 composition in the topmost layer.

This detailed structural characterization is crucial for several reasons:

1. It provides a foundation for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which require precise knowledge of atomic positions and compositions.

2. It reveals the complex interplay between Ni and Pt atoms, including exchange processes and alloy formation, which significantly influence the electronic and chemical properties of the surface.

3. It helps explain discrepancies with previous studies on Pt(111), highlighting the importance of surface structure (e.g., steps) in determining growth behavior.

4. The information on temperature-dependent alloying and ordering is vital for understanding and controlling the surface composition in catalysis applications.

This comprehensive understanding of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface structure is essential for explaining and predicting its electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties, which are central to advanced surface science and catalysis research.

通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要是使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行的。这种技术可以对表面进行原子尺度的成像，揭示了Ni在Pt上的生长模式、原子排列和合金行为的关键信息。

研究表明，即使在低温（150 K）下，Ni原子也会与Pt原子交换，这种交换过程发生在台阶和台面位置。这种交换过程导致了表面合金的形成，而不是简单的覆盖层结构。合金的成分和有序度取决于沉积温度和覆盖度。

在150 K时，观察到不规则的单层岛，以及嵌入Pt表面的Ni原子。当温度升高到300 K时，形成了更有序的2×2取代型合金，最顶层的成分为Ni20Pt80。

这种详细的结构表征对于以下几个方面至关重要：

1. 为准确的结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提供了基础，这些计算需要精确了解原子位置和成分。

2. 揭示了Ni和Pt原子之间复杂的相互作用，包括交换过程和合金形成，这些过程显著影响了表面的电子和化学性质。

3. 有助于解释与之前在Pt(111)上进行的研究的差异，突出了表面结构（如台阶）在决定生长行为中的重要性。

4. 关于温度依赖的合金化和有序化的信息对于理解和控制催化应用中的表面成分至关重要。

对Ni/Pt双金属表面结构的全面理解对于解释和预测其电子、化学和催化性质至关重要，这些性质是先进表面科学和催化研究的核心。
