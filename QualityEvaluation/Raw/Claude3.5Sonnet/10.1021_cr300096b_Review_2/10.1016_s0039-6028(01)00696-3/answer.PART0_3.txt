[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "The experiments were performed in a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus which is described elsewhere [7], [8]."

[4] "Ni was deposited by means of an e-beam evaporator. After evaporation, the sample was cooled to 77 K; all STM images have been recorded at this temperature."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at low temperatures. This process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It allows direct observation of atomic-scale structures and processes, such as Ni-Pt exchange and alloy formation.

2. It provides insights into the temperature-dependent behavior of Ni on Pt surfaces, revealing different structures at various temperatures.

3. The data obtained from STM studies can be used to inform and validate structural models and DFT calculations.

4. It enables a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry and atomic arrangements, which is essential for explaining the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

5. The detailed characterization helps in understanding the formation of ordered surface alloys, which is crucial for catalysis research.

This comprehensive characterization approach contributes significantly to advanced surface science and catalysis research by providing a fundamental understanding of the Ni/Pt system at the atomic level.

通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是使用低温扫描隧道显微镜(STM)进行的。这个过程之所以至关重要，有以下几个原因：

1. 它允许直接观察原子尺度的结构和过程，如Ni-Pt交换和合金形成。

2. 它提供了Ni在Pt表面上的温度依赖行为的洞察，揭示了不同温度下的不同结构。

3. 从STM研究中获得的数据可用于指导和验证结构模型和密度泛函理论(DFT)计算。

4. 它能够更深入地理解表面化学和原子排列，这对解释这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。

5. 详细的表征有助于理解有序表面合金的形成，这对催化研究至关重要。

这种全面的表征方法通过提供Ni/Pt系统在原子水平上的基本理解，为先进的表面科学和催化研究做出了重大贡献。
