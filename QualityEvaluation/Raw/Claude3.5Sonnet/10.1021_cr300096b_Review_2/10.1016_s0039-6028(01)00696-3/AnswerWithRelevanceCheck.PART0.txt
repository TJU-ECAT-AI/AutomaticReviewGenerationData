          [1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "The experiments were performed in a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus which is described elsewhere [7], [8]. The Pt(9 9 7) surface was prepared in situ by repeated cycles of 800 eV Ar+ sputtering and annealing to 850 K, followed by a brief exposure to 1×107 mbar oxygen and by a flash anneal to T>1000 K."

[4] "Ni was deposited by means of an e-beam evaporator. After evaporation, the sample was cooled to 77 K; all STM images have been recorded at this temperature."

[5] "Deposition of 0.2 ML Ni at T=300 K results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer."

[6] "At T=150 K, Fig. 1 (a), we observe the nucleation of irregular monolayer islands that grow with one side attached to the ascending step edge. We also observe a large number of bright round spots that appear about 0.4 Å higher than the surrounding Pt. These features represent Ni atoms embedded in Pt, as shown by Schmid et al. in an STM study of the Pt25Ni75(1 1 1) surface [15]."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is primarily conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at low temperatures. The process involves several key steps:

1. Preparation of the Pt substrate: The Pt(9 9 7) surface is prepared in situ through cycles of Ar+ sputtering, annealing, oxygen exposure, and flash annealing.

2. Ni deposition: Nickel is deposited using an e-beam evaporator at various temperatures (150-300 K).

3. STM imaging: After deposition, the sample is cooled to 77 K, and all STM images are recorded at this temperature.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because:

1. It reveals unexpected behaviors: The study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms even at low temperatures (150 K), forming surface alloys instead of pseudomorphic growth.

2. It provides atomic-scale insights: STM allows direct observation of atomic arrangements, including embedded Ni atoms and the formation of ordered structures.

3. It demonstrates temperature-dependent behavior: Different structures and alloy compositions are observed at various temperatures, such as a 2×2 substitutional alloy at 300 K.

4. It challenges previous assumptions: The findings contradict earlier results on Pt(111), highlighting the importance of surface structure in determining growth behavior.

5. It informs accurate modeling: The detailed structural information is essential for creating precise models and performing accurate DFT calculations.

This comprehensive characterization approach significantly contributes to advanced surface science and catalysis research by providing a fundamental understanding of the Ni/Pt system at the atomic level, which is crucial for explaining and predicting its electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties.

          通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要是使用低温扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行的。这个过程包括几个关键步骤：

1. Pt基底的准备：Pt(9 9 7)表面通过Ar+溅射、退火、氧气暴露和快速退火的循环过程进行原位准备。

2. Ni沉积：使用电子束蒸发器在不同温度（150-300 K）下沉积镍。

3. STM成像：沉积后，样品被冷却到77 K，所有STM图像都在这个温度下记录。

这种表征过程对结构建模、DFT计算和理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，原因如下：

1. 它揭示了意想不到的行为：研究表明，即使在低温（150 K）下，Ni原子也会与Pt原子交换，形成表面合金而不是赝同型生长。

2. 它提供了原子尺度的洞察：STM允许直接观察原子排列，包括嵌入的Ni原子和有序结构的形成。

3. 它展示了温度依赖的行为：在不同温度下观察到不同的结构和合金成分，例如在300 K时形成2×2取代型合金。

4. 它挑战了先前的假设：这些发现与早期在Pt(111)上的结果相矛盾，突出了表面结构在决定生长行为中的重要性。

5. 它为准确建模提供信息：详细的结构信息对于创建精确模型和进行准确的DFT计算至关重要。

这种全面的表征方法通过提供Ni/Pt系统在原子水平上的基本理解，为先进的表面科学和催化研究做出了重大贡献，这对解释和预测其电子、化学和催化性质至关重要。
