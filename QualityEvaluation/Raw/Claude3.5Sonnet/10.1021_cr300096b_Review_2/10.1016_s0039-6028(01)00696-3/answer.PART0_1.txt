[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "Deposition of 0.2 ML Ni at T=300 K results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy corresponding to a Ni20Pt80 composition of the surface topmost layer."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at various temperatures. This process is crucial because it reveals unexpected behaviors that differ from previous understanding. 

Specifically, the study shows that Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms at temperatures as low as 150 K, both at terrace and step sites, forming a surface alloy. This is in contrast to earlier findings that suggested pseudomorphic growth of Ni on Pt(111) at room temperature. 

The research demonstrates that the structure and composition of the surface alloy depend on temperature and coverage. At 300 K, a 2×2 substitutional alloy forms with a Ni20Pt80 composition in the topmost layer.

These detailed observations are essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations. They provide a more comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study highlights the importance of considering temperature-dependent alloying processes when investigating these systems.

通过在不同温度下使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）来表征通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni而合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面。这个过程至关重要，因为它揭示了与先前理解不同的意外行为。

具体来说，研究表明Ni原子在低至150 K的温度下就与Pt原子交换，无论是在台阶还是台阶位置，形成表面合金。这与早期发现的Ni在室温下在Pt(111)上赝态生长的结论形成对比。

研究表明，表面合金的结构和成分取决于温度和覆盖度。在300 K时，形成了一个2×2的取代型合金，最外层的成分为Ni20Pt80。

这些详细的观察对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。它们为理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质提供了更全面的认识，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。该研究强调了在研究这些系统时考虑温度依赖的合金化过程的重要性。
