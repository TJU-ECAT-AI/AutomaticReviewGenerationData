[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "The experiments were performed in a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus which is described elsewhere [7], [8]. The Pt(9 9 7) surface was prepared in situ by repeated cycles of 800 eV Ar+ sputtering and annealing to 850 K, followed by a brief exposure to 1×107 mbar oxygen and by a flash anneal to T>1000 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is primarily conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) in this study. The researchers use a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus to examine the submonolayer growth of Ni on a Pt(9 9 7) surface. The Pt substrate is carefully prepared through cycles of ion sputtering, annealing, and oxygen exposure.

This process is crucial for structural modeling and our understanding of these bimetallic surfaces because it reveals unexpected behaviors in the Ni/Pt system. Unlike previous studies on Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, which showed pseudomorphic growth of Ni at room temperature, this study demonstrates that on Pt(9 9 7), Ni atoms exchange with Pt atoms even at temperatures as low as 150 K, forming a surface alloy.

These findings are important for DFT calculations and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt surfaces because they show that the actual structure of these bimetallic surfaces can be significantly different from what might be expected based on simple deposition models. The exchange process and alloy formation observed at various temperatures provide crucial information for accurately modeling these surfaces in catalysis research and other applications in advanced surface science.

在这项研究中，主要使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征。研究人员使用自制的低温STM装置来检查Ni在Pt(9 9 7)表面上的亚单层生长。Pt基底通过离子溅射、退火和氧气暴露的循环过程进行仔细准备。

这个过程对结构建模和我们理解这些双金属表面至关重要，因为它揭示了Ni/Pt系统中意想不到的行为。与之前在Pt(1 1 1)表面上的研究不同，后者显示Ni在室温下呈赝同型生长，而本研究表明，在Pt(9 9 7)上，即使在低至150 K的温度下，Ni原子也会与Pt原子交换，形成表面合金。

这些发现对密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和理解Ni/Pt表面的电子和化学性质很重要，因为它们表明这些双金属表面的实际结构可能与基于简单沉积模型预期的结构有显著不同。在不同温度下观察到的交换过程和合金形成为催化研究和其他高级表面科学应用中准确建模这些表面提供了关键信息。
