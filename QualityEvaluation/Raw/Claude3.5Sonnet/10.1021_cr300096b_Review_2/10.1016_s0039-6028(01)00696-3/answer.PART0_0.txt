[1] "We present an STM study of submonolayer Ni growth on Pt(9 9 7). We show that Ni atoms exchange with Pt already at T=150 K both at terrace and at step sites."

[2] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."

[3] "Although we observe Ni atoms incorporated in the Pt terraces, it is clear that exchange is favored at step sites. In fact, the steps appear already saturated (2×1 superstructure) with Ni at 150 K."

[4] "Deposition at T=300 K leads to the formation of a 2×2 alloy on the Pt terraces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates is conducted using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at various temperatures. This process is crucial because it reveals unexpected behaviors in the Ni/Pt system, such as the exchange of Ni atoms with Pt substrate atoms even at low temperatures (150 K), the formation of surface alloys, and the development of ordered structures depending on temperature and deposition sites.

The study shows that contrary to previous assumptions of pseudomorphic growth, Ni atoms readily exchange with Pt atoms on both terrace and step sites of the Pt(9 9 7) surface. This exchange process is favored at step sites, leading to a 2x1 superstructure at 150 K. At higher temperatures (300 K), a 2x2 alloy forms on the terraces.

These findings are critical for structural modeling and DFT calculations as they provide a more accurate picture of the actual surface structure and composition. Understanding these exchange processes and the resulting alloy formations is essential for comprehending the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which have significant implications for catalysis research and other applications in surface science.

The study demonstrates the importance of detailed, temperature-dependent investigations in revealing complex surface phenomena that might be overlooked in simpler models or assumptions. This comprehensive understanding is vital for accurately predicting and tailoring the properties of bimetallic surfaces for various applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）在不同温度下进行的。这个过程非常重要，因为它揭示了Ni/Pt系统中意想不到的行为，比如即使在低温（150 K）下Ni原子也会与Pt基底原子交换，形成表面合金，以及根据温度和沉积位置形成有序结构。

研究表明，与先前假设的赝同形生长相反，Ni原子在Pt(9 9 7)表面的台阶和台阶位置都容易与Pt原子交换。这种交换过程在台阶位置更容易发生，导致在150 K时形成2x1超结构。在更高的温度（300 K）下，在台阶上形成2x2合金。

这些发现对结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算至关重要，因为它们提供了更准确的实际表面结构和成分图像。理解这些交换过程和由此产生的合金形成对于理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，这对催化研究和表面科学的其他应用有重要意义。

该研究表明，详细的、依赖温度的调查对于揭示可能在更简单的模型或假设中被忽视的复杂表面现象的重要性。这种全面的理解对于准确预测和调整双金属表面的性质以用于先进表面科学和催化研究的各种应用至关重要。
