    "QuestionEnglish": "How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?",
    "QuestionChinese": "通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层而合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面是如何进行表征的，为什么这个过程对结构建模、密度泛函理论(DFT)计算以及我们全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质至关重要？"
