Abstract 
The growth and structure of thin Pt films on Cu(ll1) 
have been studied by low energy Li+ ion scattering. The results are 
compared 
to those obtained from a Cu,Pt(l 11) single crystal alloy. Deposition 
of Pt on Cu( 111) at coverages 
up to a few 
monolayers 
at room temperature 
( < 50C) and then annealing to 300C result in the formation of a metastable 
surface alloy. 
This surface alloy has been examined to consist of at least three layers of Cu,Pt by analyzing the incident angle dependence 
associated 
with shadowing 
effects. 
The experimental 
results also show that the surface composition 
depends 
strongly on 
annealing temperature. 
The formation of a relatively stable surface alloy in local equilibrium 
over the few topmost layers is 
discussed on the basis of the segregation 
and ordering behaviour. No surface chemical ordering of the surface alloy has been 
evidenced 
in this study. 
1. Introduction 
The growth 
of thin films 
on metal 
substrates 
is a 
rapidly expanding 
field due to the fundamental 
importance 
of these systems in both heterogeneous 
catalysis and sur- 
face science. We have chosen the Pt/Cu(ll 
1) system as 
part of our research project on thin films and surface alloys 
for surface analysis. Interest in this system arises from the 
fact that Cu-Pt 
alloys have very useful properties 
with 
respect 
to their industrial 
applications 
for hydrocarbon 
reactions and oxidation of CO to CO, [I]. It is well known 
that the Cu-Pt 
alloy forms a continuous 
substitutionally 
disordered 
structure 
at high temperatures, 
while at low 
temperatures 
various 
ordered 
structures 
are formed 
[2]. 
Studies of the Pt/Cu(l 
I 1) system have been carried out 
recently 
by using 
Auger 
electron 
spectroscopy 
(AES), 
low-energy 
electron 
diffraction, 
core level photoemission 
spectroscopy 
(PES) and X-ray 
photoelectron 
diffraction 
(XPD) [3]. For deposition 
at room temperature 
(RT) the 
growth mechanism 
is layer-by-layer 
up to at least three 
monolayers. 
At 315C, the Pt atoms 
diffuse 
into the 
Cu( I 11) substrate and a surface alloy is formed. However, 
the precise composition 
and structure of the Pt/Cu( 11 I) 
surface have not been identified. 
In this paper, we report the growth of thin Pt films on 
Cu( 1 
I I) using 1 keV Li+ ion scattering. 
In particular, we 
have examined 
the composition 
and structure of the films 
deposited at RT and after annealing.

tering is especially 
well suited for this study since it has 
extreme 
sensitivity 
to the surface layers of the thin film 
and the alloy [4-61. 
2. Experimental 
The angle 
resolved 
ion scattering 
system 
has been 
described 
previously 
[7,8]. The UHV chamber 
(- 
1 X 
IO- lo mbar base pressure) was equipped with a three-grid 
LEED unit. The angle of incidence, 
(Y, measured from the 
sample surface plane, was calibrated 
by laser alignment. 
The azimuthal angle, $, measured from the [Oil] azimuth 
of clean Cuf 1111, was determined 
by LEED measurements 
and then adjusted using LEIS azimuthal 
scans. The scat- 
tered ions were energetically 
analyzed by a hemispherical 
electrostatic 
analyzer (A E/E = 0.021, which is rotatable to 
allow variation 
of the laboratory 
scattering 
8 from 0 to 
130. The accuracies 
of the angles 
(Y, $ and 9 were 
f0.5. 
k 1 and k 1 respectively. 
As a measure of the 
peak (Cu and Pt) intensities, 
the integrated 
yields were 
determined 
by a linear background 
subtraction. 
The well oriented ( 5 0.5) and polished Cu( 11 I) sam- 
ple was cleaned by cycles of Ar+ ion bombardment 
(20 
min. 0.5 kA, 2 keV) and annealing (10 min, 550-650C). 
The temperature 
was measured by a chromel-alumel 
ther- 
mocouple 
and checked with an IR pyrometer. 
The purity 
was verified by He+ LEIS, the surface ordering by LEED. 
Pt was sublimated 
via a home-built 
evaporator 
source 
using a high purity Pt filament 
of 0.4 mm diameter 
by 
heating. With the source well outgassed 
prior to Pt evapo- 
ration, the pressure 
increase during evaporation 
was 4 X

The evaporation 
rate was estimated 
to be 1.0 +

the sample 
was cleaned by ion bombardment 
and annealing. 
3. Results 
3.1. Pt/ Cdl 11) surface characterisation 
Pt films on Cu(lll> 
deposited 
at RT (5 50C) with 
thicknesses 
ranging from 0.2 to 5 ML were studied. How- 
ever, our main interest focused on the coverage regime of 
5 - 3.2 ML. The monolayer 
completion 
of the Pt films 
was calibrated 
with LEIS in conditions 
where no dissolu- 
tion of Pt into the Cu(1 11) substrate takes place. 
Fig. 1 depicts a plot of the film signal normalised 
to the 
sum of film and substrate signals as a function of Pt film 
thickness. 
Typical energy spectrum for this experiment 
is 
shown in the inset with a Pt coverage 
of 0.6 ML under 
double alignment 
conditions. 
The intensity ratio in Fig. 1 
increases 
almost 
linearly 
with Pt coverage 
up to 1 ML 
where a distinct breakpoint 
in the slope is observed. 
On 
further increasing 
the Pt coverage up to about 1.5 ML, the 
residual 
Cu signal remains 
merely 
a few percent. 
This 
residual 
Cu signal 
is probably 
due to substrate 
atoms

coverage of 0.6 ML. A schematic top view of the Cu(ll1) surface

second and third layer Cu atoms, respectively. 
which are not completely 
covered by the 2D Pt film as the 
second layer starts growing 
before the completion 
of the 
first one. Nevertheless, 
a 3D cluster growth can be totally 
excluded 
since in this case one would expect the film to 
leave large parts of the substrate uncovered. 
The (1 X 1) LEED pattern was observed for Pt deposi- 
tion at RT and after annealing 
independent 
of coverage. 
There 
was no drastic 
increase 
in background 
intensity 
excluding 
a large amount 
of disordered 
Pt atoms. 
For 
coverage up to - 1 ML, a three-fold 
symmetry 
of the fee 
structure remained 
unchanged, 
indicating 
a quasi-epitaxial 
growth. 
At 3 ML Pt, we detected 
- 3% change of the 
position of the first order spots (at fixed energy), which is 
in agreement 
with the large mismatch ( - 8.7%) of Cu and 
Pt lattices. At higher coverages, 
the LEED pattern showed 
a Pt(l1 l&like structure. 
3.2. Metastable 
surface alloy formation 
In order to determine 
the thermal 
stability 
of the Pt 
films, 
LEIS signals 
were monitored 
after annealing 
to 
various temperatures 
for representative 
thin (1 ML) and 
thick (3 ML) Pt films deposited on Cu( ill). 
In this and the 
following sections, annealing refers to heating to the speci- 
fied temperature 
and holding the substrate at that tempera- 
ture for 5 min. 
The results indicate that the Pt and Cu signals show a 
strong dependence 
on the annealing 
temperature.. 
Using 
standard calibration measurements 
on reference samples of 
Cu(l11) and Pt(l1 l>, we have obtained the Pt composition 
in the outermost 
layer as a function of annealing tempera- 
ture. This is shown in Fig. 2. For 1 ML Pt coverage (Fig. 
2a), the surface 
Pt composition 
remains 
fairly constant 
below 150C. A large change of the Pt composition 
occurs 
at annealing 
temperatures 
from 
150 to 220C. The Pt 
composition 
shows a plateau over the 250-350C 
tempera- 
ture range. The Pt composition 
reduces to about 10% of its 
original value after annealing to 450C. At 55OC, a nearly 
pure Cu surface layer is formed on top of a dilute Pt-Cu 
alloy. Similar annealing behaviour is observed for a thicker 
Pt film of 3 ML. Fig. 2b shows that no Cu is present 
initially at the surface of the thick Pt film deposited at RT. 
Cu is detectable 
at the surface after annealing 
to 150C. 
The plateau 
which 
occurs 
at 280-380C 
region 
is at- 
tributed to the increased 
stability of certain compositions 
of a Pt-Cu 
surface 
alloy. The Pt composition 
reaches 
values of 16% and 5% of its original value at 450 and 
55OC, respectively. 
Further annealing 
experiments 
reveal that the surface 
alloys appear to be stable isothermally 
on annealing 
to 
300C for times exceeding 
60 min for 1 ML Pt deposition 
and 80 min for 3 ML deposition. 
The surface alloy (Cu,Pt> 
formed after annealing at 300C for 60 min shows slightly 
enriched in Cu in the surface layer in both cases. It should 
be noted that little surface segregation 
of Cu is expected as

a result of interdiffusion, 
which is in agreement 
with our 
measurements 
on bulk Cu,Pt(l I I> alloy surface 
[8]. In 
addition, the alloy stoichiometry 
was identical when the Pt 
was deposited 
onto a heated 
(300C) 
substrate, 
or de- 
posited at RT and subsequently 
heated. This indicates that 
annealing 
increases 
the kinetics 
of alloy formation 
and 
allows the surface to come to equilibrium relatively rapidly. 
The structure of thin Pt films up to 3.2 ML has been 
measured by monitoring 
the Pt and Cu signals obtained at 
grazing incidence. 
Fig. 3a shows the azimuthal 
scans for 
two Pt coverages 
before and after annealing to 300C. The 
ordering and symmetry of the film can be obtained directly 
from the shadowing 
dips along the main crystallographic 
directions. 
At as-deposited 
surfaces, only the Pt signals are 
observed, 
showing 
the azimuthal 
dependence 
along the 
low index directions although the main shadowing 
dips are 
less pronounced 
(Fig. 3a) compared 
to the clean Cu( 111) 
surface (Fig. 3b). The fact that the shadowing 
dips are 
centred at 4 = - 30. 0 and 30 corresponding 
to rows of 
the Pt atoms aligned 
in these directions 
do not shift in 
azimuth with Cu(1 1 
1) demonstrates 
directly that the sym- 
metry of the Pt overlayer 
is the same as that for the 
substrate. 
This also indicates 
that the Pt overlayer 
is not 
disordered. 
When Pt films are annealed to 300C both Pt 
and Cu are detectable 
due to interdiffusion. 
The fact that 
the Pt and Cu 4 scans 
are nearly 
identical 
in shape 
compared 
to the scans from Cu,Pt(l 
11) (Fig. 3c) confirms 
the formation of a Cu,Pt surface alloy.

3.3. Structure of Pt films on Cdl 11) 
To further clarify 
the structure 
of the Pt films, 
the 
incident angle Q scans have been performed. 
By analyzing 
the shadowing 
features 
in the a scans, 
it allows 
us to 
determine 
the symmetry, 
the orientation 
and the stacking 
of the film. We determined 
the position 
of the critical 
angle Q, (the shadowing 
edge) corresponding 
to 80% of 
maximum intensity [7]. 
Fig. 4a shows typical c1 scans for deposition 
of 3.2 ML 
Pt on Cu(lll) 
along the [151] azimuth at 0 = 130, col- 
lected as a function of annealing temperature. 
The a scans 
measured 
for the clean Cu(ll1) 
and Cu,Ptf 111) surfaces 
under the same scattering conditions 
are shown in Figs. 4b 
and 4c, respectively. 
The most important feature in Fig. 4 
is that along the [ 1211 azimuth there are three shadowing 
edges (a, = 16. 31 and 75) for 3.2 ML Pt film (Fig. 4a) 
and similar critical 
values (a, = 14, 29 and 74) for 
Cu(ll1) 
(Fig. 4b), while along the [Ti2] azimuth 
(not 
shown) there are two critical angles of (Y, = 16 and 54 
for the Pt film and two values of LX, 
= 14 and 53 for 
Cu(l11). 
These features are consistent 
with the conclusion 
that the Pt films have the ABCABC 
stacking of the

fee structure. The ABAB . . . stacking of the hcp structure 
can be excluded. The structures and expected differences 
between hcp (0001) and fcc( 111) surfaces have been dis- 
cussed by us recently 191. 
From the Cu a scans at T 5 1 
SYC, we observe that the 
presence of the 3.2 ML Pt overlayers result in disappear- 
ance of the three shadowing peaks. Note that near the third 
shadowing peak at higher incident angles, scattering from 
second and third layers is dominant [9]. It is concluded that 
there are few Cu atoms in the top three layers. This 
observation is again associated with the completion of _ 3 
ML Pt and agrees with layer-by-layer 
growth deduced 
from AES 133. 
With increasing annealing temperatures, no 
extra Cu and Pt shadowing features appear which is in 
good agreement with LEED observations, confirming the 
stacking of an fee lattice structure. At 3OOC, 
the identical 
shadowing features of the Pt and Cu signals compared to 
those of Cu,Pt(l 
11) are observed, supporting the forma- 
tion of a Cu,Pt surface alloy at this temperature. The 
observed Pt and Cu shadowing peaks at higher incident 
angles strongly suggest that there are at least three layers 
of Cu,Pt. At higher annealing temperatures, the Pt is more 
dilute in the top three layers. 
In order to determine the relative position of the Cu and 
Pt atoms in the surface layer for the Cu,Pt surface alloy 
formed on annealing, scattering potentials for the interac- 
tion of Li-Pt and Li-Cu must be calibrated. Using the 
same method for calibration of scattering potentials on the 
Cu,Pdl 11) surface [8], we have measured the first critical 
angle cy 
c for Cu shadowing of Pt along the [ 12 
I] and [Oi I] 
azimuths at 0 = 110 and compared to the calculated criti- 
cal values (note that the lattice constant of Cu,Pt crystal is 
3.70 A>. 
When calculating (Y 
c, the Thomas-Fermi-Moliere 
(TFM) potential with parameter values of cc = 0.80 and 
cpt = 0.92 were used [81. The comparison between the 
experimental critical angles (a, = 14 in [ljl] 
and a, = 
20.0 in [Oil] at 8 = 110) and the calculated ones (ty, = 
13.8 in [lzl] and CX, 
= 19.7 in [Oil] at 8 = 110% indi- 
cates that the Pt and Cu atoms are in the same plane within 
experimental uncertainty of 0.05 A. This result is compati- 
ble with interpretations of our previous data on Cu,Pt(l 
11) 
181. 
4. 
Discussion and coclion 
Three observations, which relate to the structure of thin 
Pt films on Cu(l11) deposited at RT, have been described. 
First, the main shadowing dips of the Pt signals in the (b 
scans are similar to those of the clean Cu(1 1 
11, suggesting 
that significant order is present in the Pt overlayer. No 
change in film orientation relative to the substrate is found. 
Second, scattering under special experimental conditions 
where single scattering only from the top layer should be 
seen illustrates that only Pt atoms are present on the top 
layer. This indicates that Pt does not mix with Cu at RT. 
Third, the three shadowing features in the (Y scans are 
essentially the same along the [l?l] azimuth compared to 
those from Cu( 111) and Cu,Pt( 11 
l), indicating that the fee 
stacking remains. 
The initial growth behaviour of metal thin films on 
metal substrates is determined by energetic and kinetic 
effects. The system tends to form the energetically most 
favourable configuration, 
while kinetics determines the 
growth behaviour of the film. In most cases, thin films are 
grown under experimental conditions far from thermody- 
namical equilibrium. Film growth and the resulting mor- 
phologies will then be governed by kinetic factors. The 
large positive surface energy difference between platinum 
and copper (yr, - ye,, > 0) should favour a 3D cluster 
growth for Pt on Cu(ll1) 
[IO]. However, this is not 
observed in the present work and in previous studies [3]. 
The strong tendency of the Pt overlayer toward an epitax- 
ial-growth evidenced by LEED and low energy Li ion 
scattering reflects its relatively strong Pt-Cu interaction. It 
seems that the growth of me&stable Pt overlayers on 
Cu(l11) may be possible under some conditions due to 
kinetic limitations. We believe that the arriving *hot Pt 
atoms at RT have sufficiently high mobility to obtain their 
quasi-equilibrium 2D configuration, while the true equilib- 
rium configuration would correspond to an interdiffused 
Pt-Cu alloy. 
Pt overlayers on Cut1 11) are known to undergo inter- 
mixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures. Under

Instr. und Meth. in Phys. Res. B I15 f

19s 
appropriate 
annealing 
conditions 
(- 3OOC), this leads to 
the formation 
of a metastable 
surface 
alloy. The alloy 
structure was stable between 
- 280-380C 
for 3 ML Pt, 
the stability regime decreasing 
to - 250-350C 
for 1 ML 
Pt. The observed 
composition 
change 
with temperature 
strongly 
suggests 
that the stoichiometry 
of the surface 
alloy is Cu,Pt: 
bulk phases of composition 
Cu,Pt, 
CuPt 
and CuPt, 
are known to exist [2]. A comparison 
of the 
PtfCu) o scans between 
a surface alloy and Cu,Ptil 
11) 
bulk alloy indicates 
that there are at least three layers of 
Cu,Pt. 
It is interesting 
to note that the fee structure exists 
in the bulk down to very dilute Pt concentrations, 
although 
it is a relatively 
stable surface alloy for the Cu,Pt 
case. 
However, evidence for surface long range ordering was not 
observed 
during the whole course of the experiment. 
The 
reason for the absence 
of the predicted 
(2 X 2) ordered 
phase is not clear. This question 
is being examined 
both 
experimentally 
and theoretically. 
By ion scattering 
it was determined 
that the Pt atoms 
are coplanar 
with the Cu atoms in the first layer of the 
Cu,Pt 
surface alloy. The extent of this surface buckling 
was determined 
directly 
from the 1, for the Pt single 
scattering. This determination 
of the surface vertical relax- 
ation is direct, and independent 
of the first-second 
inter- 
layer spacing 
and possible 
relaxation 
in the second 
or 
deeper layers. 
In conclusion, 
the Pt film on Cu(ll1) 
grows in an fee 
stacking pattern up to a few layers. A metastable 
surface 
alloy is formed on annealing to about 300C and is exam- 
ined to consist 
of at least three layers of Cu,Pt. 
The 
experimental 
results also show that the surface composi- 
tion depends 
strongly 
on annealing 
temperature. 
No sur- 
face chemical 
ordering 
of the surface 
alloy has been 
evidenced 
in this study.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
