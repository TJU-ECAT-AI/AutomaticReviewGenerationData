[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates and then annealing the sample. This process causes a significant fraction of Ni atoms to migrate to subsurface sites. The location of Ni atoms (surface vs subsurface) strongly affects the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the bimetallic surface. DFT calculations show that a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) increases the HBE compared to pure Ni or Pt, while subsurface Ni decreases it. This characterization process is crucial because it reveals how the structure of the bimetallic surface influences its electronic and chemical properties, which is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations. Understanding these relationships is fundamental to advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows researchers to predict and potentially control the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层，然后对样品进行退火。这个过程会导致相当一部分Ni原子迁移到亚表面位置。Ni原子的位置（表面vs亚表面）强烈影响双金属表面的氢结合能(HBE)。密度泛函理论(DFT)计算表明，Pt(111)上的Ni单层会增加HBE，相比纯Ni或Pt，而亚表面Ni则会降低HBE。这个表征过程至关重要，因为它揭示了双金属表面结构如何影响其电子和化学性质，这对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算是必不可少的。理解这些关系对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够预测并可能控制双金属表面的反应活性。
