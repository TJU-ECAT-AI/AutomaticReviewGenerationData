[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, followed by annealing. This process causes a significant fraction of Ni atoms to migrate to subsurface sites. The location of Ni atoms strongly affects the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the surface. DFT calculations show that when Ni forms a monolayer on Pt(111), the HBE is higher than on either pure Ni or Pt. However, when Ni is in the subsurface (denoted as PtNiPt), the HBE is lower than on either pure metal.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it reveals how the arrangement of atoms in these bimetallic surfaces impacts their electronic and chemical properties. Understanding these relationships is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows researchers to predict and potentially tailor the behavior of these surfaces for specific applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层，然后进行退火。这个过程导致大部分Ni原子迁移到亚表面位置。Ni原子的位置强烈影响表面的氢结合能(HBE)。DFT计算表明，当Ni在Pt(111)上形成单层时，HBE高于纯Ni或纯Pt。然而，当Ni位于亚表面（表示为PtNiPt）时，HBE低于任一纯金属。

这种表征过程对结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它揭示了这些双金属表面中原子排列如何影响其电子和化学性质。理解这些关系对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它允许研究人员预测并可能为特定应用定制这些表面的行为。
