[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) surfaces and then annealing the sample. This process causes a significant fraction of Ni atoms to migrate to subsurface sites. The location of Ni atoms (surface vs. subsurface) strongly affects the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the bimetallic surface. DFT calculations show that a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) increases the HBE compared to pure Ni or Pt, while subsurface Ni decreases the HBE. This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it reveals how the arrangement of atoms in the bimetallic surface influences its electronic and chemical properties. Understanding these relationships is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows researchers to predict and potentially control the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过在Pt(111)表面沉积Ni单层然后退火样品来进行的。这个过程导致大部分Ni原子迁移到亚表面位置。Ni原子的位置(表面vs.亚表面)强烈影响双金属表面的氢结合能(HBE)。DFT计算表明，Pt(111)上的Ni单层会增加HBE，相比纯Ni或Pt，而亚表面Ni则会降低HBE。这个表征过程对结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它揭示了双金属表面中原子排列如何影响其电子和化学性质。理解这些关系对先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够预测并可能控制双金属表面的反应活性。
