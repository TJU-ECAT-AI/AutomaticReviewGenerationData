[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) surfaces and then annealing the sample. This process causes a significant portion of Ni atoms to migrate to subsurface sites. The location of Ni atoms (surface vs. subsurface) strongly affects the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the bimetallic surface. DFT calculations show that when Ni remains as a surface monolayer (NiPtPt), the HBE is higher than on either pure Ni or Pt. However, when Ni atoms move to subsurface positions (PtNiPt), the HBE becomes lower than on either pure metal.

This characterization process is crucial because it reveals the structural changes that occur in Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces upon annealing, which significantly impacts their electronic and chemical properties. Understanding these changes is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations. It also provides insights into how the surface composition and structure influence the catalytic properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which is vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The ability to control and predict the behavior of these bimetallic surfaces based on their preparation methods can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for various applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)表面上沉积Ni单层，然后对样品进行退火。这个过程会导致大部分Ni原子迁移到亚表面位置。Ni原子的位置（表面vs.亚表面）强烈影响双金属表面的氢结合能（HBE）。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，当Ni保持为表面单层（NiPtPt）时，HBE高于纯Ni或纯Pt。然而，当Ni原子移动到亚表面位置（PtNiPt）时，HBE变得低于任一纯金属。

这个表征过程至关重要，因为它揭示了Ni/Pt双金属表面在退火过程中发生的结构变化，这些变化显著影响了它们的电子和化学性质。理解这些变化对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。它还提供了关于表面组成和结构如何影响这些双金属表面催化性能的见解，这对先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。基于制备方法控制和预测这些双金属表面行为的能力可以导致设计出更高效的催化剂，用于各种应用。
