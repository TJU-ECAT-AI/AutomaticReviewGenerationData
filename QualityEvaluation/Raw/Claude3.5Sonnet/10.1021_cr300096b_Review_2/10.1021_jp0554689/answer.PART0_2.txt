[1] "When Ni is adsorbed on a Pt(111) surface and annealed, a significant fraction of the Ni atoms reside in subsurface sites of the 1.0 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."

[2] "As previously demonstrated, the location of the Ni atoms has a strong effect on the HBE. As illustrated by the results of the DFT calculations in Figure 2b, the HBE on a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) (designated NiPtPt) is higher than that on either Ni or Pt, whereas for subsurface Ni (designated PtNiPt), it is lower than on either Ni or Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, followed by annealing. This process causes a significant fraction of Ni atoms to migrate to subsurface sites. The location of Ni atoms (surface vs subsurface) strongly affects the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the bimetallic surface. DFT calculations show that a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) increases HBE compared to pure Ni or Pt, while subsurface Ni decreases HBE. This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it reveals how the atomic arrangement influences electronic properties and chemical reactivity. Understanding these relationships is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows researchers to predict and tailor the properties of bimetallic surfaces for specific applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层，然后进行退火。这个过程导致大部分Ni原子迁移到亚表面位置。Ni原子的位置（表面vs亚表面）强烈影响双金属表面的氢结合能（HBE）。DFT计算表明，Pt(111)上的Ni单层与纯Ni或Pt相比增加了HBE，而亚表面Ni则降低了HBE。这种表征过程对结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它揭示了原子排列如何影响电子性质和化学反应活性。理解这些关系对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它允许研究人员预测和调整双金属表面的性质以适应特定应用。
