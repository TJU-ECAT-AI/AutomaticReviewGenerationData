[1] "Step mediated intermixing has been observed previously in both the Ag/Pt(1 1 1) [18] and Ni/Pt(1 1 1) [19] systems. However, for these systems the intermixing appears to be kinetically limited to the step edges with the lateral incorporation of overlayer adatoms only extending a few lattice sites into the terrace."

The literature does not provide specific details on the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) substrates. It only briefly mentions that step-mediated intermixing has been observed in the Ni/Pt(111) system, with intermixing limited to step edges and extending only a few lattice sites into terraces. The document does not discuss structural modeling, DFT calculations, or comprehensive understanding of electronic and chemical properties for these surfaces in the context of surface science and catalysis research.

该文献没有提供关于通过在Pt(111)衬底上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的具体表征细节。它只是简单提到在Ni/Pt(111)系统中观察到了台阶介导的混合，混合仅限于台阶边缘，并且只延伸到台阶面几个晶格位置。文档没有讨论这些表面在表面科学和催化研究背景下的结构建模、DFT计算或电子和化学性质的全面理解。
