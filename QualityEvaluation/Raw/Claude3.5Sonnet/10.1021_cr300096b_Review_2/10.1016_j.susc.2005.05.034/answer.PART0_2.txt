[1] "Step mediated intermixing has been observed previously in both the Ag/Pt(1 1 1) [18] and Ni/Pt(1 1 1) [19] systems. However, for these systems the intermixing appears to be kinetically limited to the step edges with the lateral incorporation of overlayer adatoms only extending a few lattice sites into the terrace."

The literature does not provide detailed information on the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates. It only briefly mentions that step-mediated intermixing has been observed in the Ni/Pt(111) system, with intermixing limited to step edges and extending only a few lattice sites into the terrace. The document does not discuss structural modeling, DFT calculations, or comprehensive understanding of electronic and chemical properties for Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in the context of surface science and catalysis research.

这篇文献没有提供关于通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的详细表征信息。它只是简单提到在Ni/Pt(111)体系中观察到了台阶介导的混合，混合仅限于台阶边缘并只延伸到台阶面的几个晶格位置。文档没有讨论Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构建模、DFT计算或在表面科学和催化研究背景下对其电子和化学性质的全面理解。
