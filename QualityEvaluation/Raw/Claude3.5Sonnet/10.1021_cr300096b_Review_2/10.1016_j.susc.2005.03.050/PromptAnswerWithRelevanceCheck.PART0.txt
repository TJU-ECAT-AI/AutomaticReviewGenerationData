Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt substrates. The document focuses on the growth of platinum films on Cu(100) surfaces and their characterization using CAICISS, XPS, and LEED techniques. It does not discuss Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces or their synthesis, characterization, or relevance to structural modeling, DFT calculations, or catalysis research.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于通过在Pt基底上沉积Ni来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征信息。该文档主要关注铂薄膜在Cu(100)表面上的生长,以及使用CAICISS、XPS和LEED技术对其进行的表征。它没有讨论Ni/Pt双金属表面或其合成、表征,以及与结构建模、DFT计算或催化研究的相关性。
