[1] "In the present work we study one such system, viz. the growth of Ni on Pt(1 1 1), which has been the subject of prior experimental [2], [3], [4] work in which it was reported that the initial stages of the Ni growth occur in the hcp adsorption sites on the (1 1 1) face with little or no evidence for intermixing with the substrate."

[2] "Using the TB-DCA method and parameters described above we have calculated the point energies and the ECI for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt, which we report in Table 1."

[3] "To address these questions we have performed a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a range of coverages and temperatures."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of theoretical and computational methods. The study uses a tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging (TB-DCA) method to calculate point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs) for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface. This is followed by Monte Carlo simulations to determine equilibrium structures and phase behavior at different coverages and temperatures.

This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed insights into the adsorption behavior, site preferences, and ordering tendencies of Ni on Pt(111). The calculations reveal complex interactions and phase behaviors, including a transition from hcp to fcc site preference with increasing coverage, and the coexistence of different ordered structures (c(2×4) and c(2×6) phases).

These theoretical studies complement experimental work and provide a foundation for understanding the atomic-scale structure and properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is essential for predicting and optimizing their performance in catalysis and other applications in advanced surface science research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过理论和计算方法的结合进行的。该研究使用紧束缚直接构型平均(TB-DCA)方法计算了吸附在Pt(111)表面上的各种二维Ni簇的点能和有效簇相互作用(ECIs)。随后进行蒙特卡罗模拟，以确定不同覆盖度和温度下的平衡结构和相行为。

这个过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论(DFT)计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了Ni在Pt(111)上的吸附行为、位点偏好和有序趋势的详细洞察。计算结果揭示了复杂的相互作用和相行为，包括随着覆盖度增加从六方密堆(hcp)到面心立方(fcc)位点偏好的转变，以及不同有序结构(c(2×4)和c(2×6)相)的共存。

这些理论研究补充了实验工作，为理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的原子尺度结构和性质提供了基础。这些知识对于预测和优化它们在催化和其他先进表面科学研究应用中的性能至关重要。
