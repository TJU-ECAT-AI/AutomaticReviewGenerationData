[1] "We have studied the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1). Using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method we calculate various ordering interactions."

[2] "We find preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a cross-over to fcc growth at increasing deposition."

[3] "The study of two-dimensional order/disorder problems using electronic structure information proceeds most frequently via the definition of a relevant Ising Hamiltonian coupled with a determination of the dominant point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs)"

[4] "We performed standard Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble. We typically started from completely disordered structures and proceeded with nearest-neighbor particle interchanges and diffusion attempts until thermal equilibrium was reached, as monitored by acceptance rates and convergence of thermodynamic averages."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) is conducted through a combination of theoretical and computational methods. These include:

1. Tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method to calculate ordering interactions.

2. Determination of point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs) using electronic structure information.

3. Monte Carlo simulations to study the equilibrium structures and phase behavior.

4. Analysis of adsorption sites (hcp vs fcc) and their preference at different coverages.

This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehensive understanding of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed insights into:

- The initial stages of Ni adsorption and growth on Pt(111)
- The ordering and phase behavior of the Ni adlayer at different temperatures and coverages
- The competition between different superstructures and adsorption sites
- The electronic structure effects that influence site preference and ordering

These theoretical and computational approaches complement experimental studies and allow for a more complete understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps predict and explain the behavior of these materials in various applications.
