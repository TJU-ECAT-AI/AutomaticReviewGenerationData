The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) is conducted through a combination of theoretical and computational methods. The study uses the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method to calculate ordering interactions and Monte Carlo simulations to determine equilibrium phases at various temperatures and coverages.

The process involves studying different concentrations of Ni (0.05, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and various cluster configurations (point, pair, triplet). The researchers focus on a temperature regime where surface diffusion is active but bulk diffusion is not, to study two-dimensional systems without considering interdiffusion between adatoms and substrate.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it reveals important insights such as:

1. Preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a transition to fcc growth at higher deposition.
2. The competition between different superstructures due to the complexity of effective cluster interactions.
3. The presence and coexistence of different ordered phases (e.g., c(2 × 6) and c(2 × 4)) depending on temperature and concentration.

These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the Ni/Pt bimetallic system, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The detailed characterization allows for the development of accurate structural models and provides a foundation for further studies, including DFT calculations, to explore the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces.

通过在Pt(111)上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过理论和计算方法的结合进行的。该研究使用紧束缚直接构型平均方法计算排序相互作用，并使用蒙特卡罗模拟来确定在不同温度和覆盖率下的平衡相。

这个过程涉及研究不同浓度的Ni（0.05、0.25、0.50和0.75）和各种团簇构型（点、对、三元组）。研究人员关注表面扩散活跃但体扩散不活跃的温度区间，以研究二维系统，而不考虑吸附原子和基底之间的相互扩散。

这种表征过程对结构建模和理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它揭示了重要的见解，如：

1. 在低覆盖率下优先吸附在hcp位点，随着沉积增加转变为fcc生长。
2. 由于有效团簇相互作用的复杂性，不同超结构之间存在竞争。
3. 根据温度和浓度的不同，存在和共存不同的有序相（例如c(2 × 6)和c(2 × 4)）。

这些发现有助于全面理解Ni/Pt双金属系统，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。详细的表征允许开发准确的结构模型，并为进一步的研究（包括DFT计算）提供基础，以探索这些表面的电子和化学性质。
