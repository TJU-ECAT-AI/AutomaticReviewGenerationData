The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) is conducted through theoretical studies and simulations. The process involves:

1. Using tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method to calculate ordering interactions.

2. Performing Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate equilibrium phases for various temperatures and coverages.

3. Calculating point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs) for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface.

4. Analyzing adsorption site preferences (hcp vs. fcc) as a function of coverage.

5. Investigating ordered surface structures and their appearance as a function of temperature and concentration.

This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehensive understanding of electronic and chemical properties because it:

1. Provides insights into the initial growth stages and adsorption site preferences.

2. Reveals complex competition between different superstructures due to the interplay of ECIs.

3. Helps determine stable ordered phases and phase boundaries.

4. Allows for the prediction of surface structures at different temperatures and concentrations.

5. Contributes to the development of a comprehensive c-T phase diagram for the system.

These theoretical studies and simulations form the foundation for understanding the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
