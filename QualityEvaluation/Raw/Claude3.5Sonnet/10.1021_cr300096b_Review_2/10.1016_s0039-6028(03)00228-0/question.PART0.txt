Theoretical study of the first stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1)
Abstract
We have studied the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1). Using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method we calculate various ordering interactions. These parameters are used in turn in Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate the expected equilibrium phases for various temperatures and coverages. We find preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a cross-over to fcc growth at increasing deposition. In addition, coexistence of c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6) phases is observed for a wide range of temperatures and concentrations.
1. Introduction
The study of metals deposited on a metallic substrate has seen rapid growth in recent years, with attention focused both on the deposition and heteroepitaxial growth of A on B as well as on the fabrication of multilayers with alternating modulations of layers of A and B of varying thickness
[1]
. These systems are expected to have a wide range of potential applications, in such areas as magnetism, optics, catalysis, tribology, corrosion, etc. Moreover, the type of phenomena observed and the theoretical underpinning of them tends to have many similarities with those relevant to semiconductor growth, an area with evident technological impact.
In the present work we study one such system, viz. the growth of Ni on Pt(1 1 1), which has been the subject of prior experimental
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
work in which it was reported that the initial stages of the Ni growth occur in the hcp adsorption sites on the (1 1 1) face with little or no evidence for intermixing with the substrate. The Ni on Pt(1 1 1) system does not seem to have been considered previously in the theoretical literature, but Majerus et al.
[5]
performed an effective medium calculation of various Pt/Ni single-atom adsorbate combinations, which bear some relevance to the system at hand.
2. Methodology
In the present work our main interest is in the growth at low coverage and relatively low temperatures. Therefore, we have restricted the morphological structures to two-dimensional systems, without taking into account a possible interdiffusion between adatoms and substrate. Thus, we must consider a temperature regime at which surface diffusion is active, but bulk diffusion is not.
The study of two-dimensional order/disorder problems using electronic structure information proceeds most frequently via the definition of a relevant Ising Hamiltonian coupled with a determination of the dominant point energies and effective cluster interactions (ECIs)
[6]
. The latter are the coefficients in a rapidly convergent expansion of the systems ordering energy in terms of cluster correlation functions. In the present work, following earlier applications on related problems
[5]
,
[6]
, we use a tight-binding (TB) prescription for the electronic structure problem, combined with the direct configurational averaging (DCA) method to determine the ECIs
[7]
. The parameters and prescriptions used are the same as in our earlier studies. In particular we took 10 levels in the continued fraction expansion, with a BeerPettifor terminator, TB-parameters from the Harrison parameterization (3d orbitals for Ni, 4d for Pt, with spin-orbit coupling), and DCA with orbital peeling performed over 50 configurations. It is generally accepted that these choices lead to a reasonably accurate and coherent picture of the ordering behavior. We performed several spot checks to ensure accuracy and convergence to the desired level.
In addition, we performed standard Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble. We typically started from completely disordered structures and proceeded with nearest-neighbor particle interchanges and diffusion attempts until thermal equilibrium was reached, as monitored by acceptance rates and convergence of thermodynamic averages.
3. Results and discussion
Using the TB-DCA method and parameters described above we have calculated the point energies and the ECI for various two-dimensional Ni-clusters adsorbed on the (1 1 1) surface of Pt, which we report in
Table 1
. We have focused on four concentrations (c=0.05, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and various cluster configurations (point, pair, triplet, as shown in
Fig. 1
). In this initial study we have only considered homogeneous systems in which all adsorption sites are equivalent (that is, either all fcc, or all hcp).

The first clear tendency to be deduced from
Table 1
is that in the dilute limit the point energies for the hcp site are lower than for the fcc sites, while for increasing concentration a stability inversion occurs, favoring the fcc sites at higher coverage. Thus the initial stages of the growth of Ni on Pt(1 1 1) are expected to occur in hcp sites, but as deposition continues a cross-over towards fcc growth is expected. This variation in point energy (with a consequent change in site occupancy) is a genuine electronic structure effect and cannot be understood in a classical potential model. It shows that even a single adatom is driven towards fcc sites due to changes in the global electronic structure. Such behavior has previously been encountered and interpreted in our study of the system Ir on Ir(1 1 1)
[8]
.
Secondly, investigating the NN pair energies in
Table 1
we note that these energies are rather weak and mainly positive, i.e. repulsive. Thus adsorption will tend to proceed in such a way that no compact superstructures are formed. The second neighbor pair energies are weak as well and predominantly negative, with rather large changes at low concentrations, while the third neighbor pair energies are strongly attractive and of the same order as the chain triplet energy. The other triplet energies are also negative, thus favoring compact structures, with the exception of the hcp sites in which the compact triplet energies are slightly positive. This allows us to conclude that there is a complex competition between the various ordering tendencies as the concentration changes, which may lead to rich phase behavior.
These findings thus allow us to pose two clear questions:
(1)
Given the numerical values of these ECI, what are the stable ordered phases that are possible as a function of concentration at absolute zero temperature (ground-states)?
(2)
What ordered surface structures occur and what is their order of appearance as a function of temperature?
Here we will focus on the second question, deferring the first one as well as a more detailed study to a future publication.
To address these questions we have performed a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a range of coverages and temperatures. The advantage of this method is that it permits an efficient determination of typical equilibrium structures and affords a reasonable description of the kinetics. However, it must be emphasized that MC kinetics is artificial in that diffusion barriers are not explicitly considered and therefore the relevant timescales cannot be reliably determined. In addition, one cannot uniquely determine the responsible interatomic exchange mechanism such as adatom or advacancy diffusion, correlated jumps, possibly driven by the cluster line tension, etc. Such considerations could drastically modify the rate of approach to thermal equilibrium, but are less important for a determination of phase boundaries and coexistence regions.
As a general conclusion, we find clear evidence for the competition between the different superstructures due to the complexity and frustration between the ECI. In general fcc structures tend to be somewhat more ordered than hcp structures at the same temperature (T) and concentration (c). The dominant superstructures encountered in the simulations are the c(2 × 6) and c(2 × 4) phases, generally coexisting, in ratios that are variable, depending on T and c. We observe that for the temperatures considered (namely, T=11.6, 116, and 232 K), the c(2 × 6) phase is present even at low concentration, although it disappears quickly with increasing temperature at small c. At fixed T, with increasing c, the c(2 × 4) phase rapidly gains precedence, with the c(2 × 6) regions replaced by small disordered patches. At c=0.75 and from a temperature of 11.6 K on the c(2 × 6) phase has entirely disappeared, the sample consisting of 90% c(2 × 4) and the remainder being small disordered islands.
Fig. 2
shows two representative snapshots of the kind of structures encountered. For adsorption in the fcc sites (
Fig. 2a
) on notices the presence of the two dominant phases (c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6)) as well as a small patch of the p(1×1) phase. In contrast the hcp domains (
Fig. 2b
) consist predominantly of c(2 × 4), with some isolated regions of c(2 × 6) and c(2×2) character.

4. Conclusions
Summarizing, we have determined the dominant ordering energies that describe the formation of two-dimensional Ni islands on Pt(1 1 1). These energies are found to be remarkably complex, leading to rich behavior in the phase diagram, with competition mainly between c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6) phases in the temperature and concentration ranges of experimental interest. The initial growth occurs in the hcp adsorption sites and we also find a cross-over to fcc growth at increasing coverage.
These findings constitute the first steps in a determination of the cT phase diagram for this system, which is expected to be particularly rich in view of the subtle interplay between the various point energies and ECIs. In addition, the cross-over from hcp to fcc growth leads to further complications, as does the possibility of kinetically arrested long-lived structures. All of these issues will be addressed in a forthcoming publication.
