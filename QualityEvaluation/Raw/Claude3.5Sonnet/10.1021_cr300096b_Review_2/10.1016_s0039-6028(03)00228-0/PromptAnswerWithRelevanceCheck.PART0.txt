The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) is conducted through theoretical modeling and simulations. The study uses the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method to calculate ordering interactions and Monte Carlo simulations to determine equilibrium phases at various temperatures and coverages. 

The process focuses on low coverage and relatively low temperatures, considering only two-dimensional systems without interdiffusion between adatoms and substrate. This approach is crucial for structural modeling and understanding the electronic and chemical properties because it allows for the investigation of surface diffusion without bulk diffusion, providing insights into the initial stages of growth and adsorption site preferences.

The study reveals preferential adsorption in hcp sites at low coverage, with a transition to fcc growth at higher deposition levels. This characterization is essential for developing accurate structural models and performing DFT calculations, as it provides a detailed understanding of the adsorption behavior and phase formation in the Ni/Pt system.

While this theoretical approach offers valuable insights, it's important to note that the study does not mention experimental characterization techniques. A comprehensive understanding of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research would likely require complementary experimental studies to validate and expand upon the theoretical findings.

通过在Pt(111)上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过理论建模和模拟进行的。该研究使用紧束缚直接构型平均方法计算排序相互作用，并使用蒙特卡洛模拟来确定在不同温度和覆盖率下的平衡相。

该过程主要关注低覆盖率和相对较低的温度，仅考虑二维系统，不考虑吸附原子和基底之间的相互扩散。这种方法对于结构建模和理解电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许在没有体相扩散的情况下研究表面扩散，从而深入了解生长的初始阶段和吸附位点偏好。

研究表明，在低覆盖率下，优先吸附在hcp位点，随着沉积量的增加，过渡到fcc生长。这种表征对于开发准确的结构模型和进行DFT计算至关重要，因为它提供了对Ni/Pt系统中吸附行为和相形成的详细理解。

虽然这种理论方法提供了宝贵的见解，但需要注意的是，该研究并未提及实验表征技术。在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下，对这些双金属表面的全面理解可能需要补充实验研究来验证和扩展理论发现。

The study uses the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method to calculate ordering interactions and Monte Carlo simulations to determine equilibrium phases at various temperatures and coverages.

The process involves studying different concentrations of Ni (0.05, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and various cluster configurations (point, pair, triplet). The researchers focus on a temperature regime where surface diffusion is active but bulk diffusion is not, to study two-dimensional systems without considering interdiffusion between adatoms and substrate.
