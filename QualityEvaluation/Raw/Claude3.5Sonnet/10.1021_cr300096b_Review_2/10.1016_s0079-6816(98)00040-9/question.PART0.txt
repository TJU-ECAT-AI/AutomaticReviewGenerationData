Abstract 
Nanoscale pyramidal 
facets with (211) faces are formed when W(lll) 
surface is cov- 
ered by monolayer film of certain metals (including Pt, Pd and Au) and annealed to 
T 2 750 K. In the present work, we focus on the structure, electronic properties 
and 
reactivity 
of planar W(211) covered by ultrathin 
films of platinum 
and palladium. 
The measurements include soft X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy using synchrotron 
radiation, 
Auger electron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction 
(LEED) 
and 
thermal 
desorption 
spectroscopy. 
The metal film growth and evolution 
during an- 
nealing has been investigated 
for coverages ranging from 0 to 8 monolayers. 
The 
films grow initially 
in a layer-by-layer 
mode at 300K. LEED, 
Auger, and Surface 
Core Level Shift (SCLS) measurements reveal that for coverages of one monolayer, 
the films are stable up to temperatures 
at which desorption 
occurs. 
In contrast, 
at higher coverages, SCLS data indicate that surface alloys are formed upon an- 
nealing films of Pt and Pd; surface alloy formation 
is not seen for Au overlayers. 
These findings are discussed in terms of structural 
and electronic properties of these 
bimetallic 
systems. Relevance to catalytic 
properties for acetylene cyclization 
over 
Pd/W(Bll) 
is also discussed. 
1. Introduction 
Recently, 
bimetallic 
systems have drawn significant 
attention 
because of their interesting 
properties, 
which lead to applications 
in fields such as novel materials, 
catalysis, 
and micro- 
electronics. 
Bimetallic 
systems (thin films and alloys) are important 
catalysts for hydrocarbon 
reactions. Their selectivity 
and activity 
may be tuned by changing concentrations, 
exposed crys- 
tallographic 
faces and thermal treatment 
[l-4]. 
Despite their importance, 
the experimental

et al. 
on these systems is rather scarce, and even general trends across the periodic table have not yet 
been established 
[5]. 
Bimetallic 
systems are rather complex and their experimental 
description 
requires a mul- 
titechnique 
approach to obtain information 
on electronic structure, 
geometry 
and defects, as 
well as adsorption 
and dissolution energies. Soft X-ray Photoelectron 
Spectroscopy 
(SXPS) is a 
particularly 
suitable technique for characterization 
of the electronic properties of such materials. 
Moreover, the utilization 
of high resolution synchrotron radiation 
as an excitation 
source allows 
one to measure such subtle effects as surface core level shifts (SCLS) and interface core level 
shifts, which recently have been topics of many theoretical 
studies [6-g]. It is believed that core 
level binding 
energy shifts provide a probe of the changes in the electronic 
structure 
of atoms 
in different chemical environments; 
this is supported by arguing that core levels associated with 
compact orbitals 
lie entirely 
within 
the valence shells, which are changed due to chemical in- 
teraction. 
Thus, the electrostatic 
potential 
in the space occupied by the core shells is changed 
uniformly. 
Nonetheless, 
interpretation 
of photoelectron 
spectra is not easy, as-apart 
from a 
simple charge exchange effect-they 
may be influenced by a number of other effects related to 
changes in final state screening, changes in the reference level (Fermi energy) and intra-atomic 
charge transfer [q]. Other complementary 
techniques, such as Temperature 
Programmed 
Desorp- 
tion (TPD), 
Auger Electron 
Spectroscopy (AES) or Low Energy Electron 
Diffraction 
(LEED), 
are necessary to measure adsorption/desorption 
energies, and to diagnose the geometric structure 
and overall chemical composition 
in bimetallic 
systems. 
In the present work, we study transition 
and noble metals (Pd, Pt, Au) on a tungsten (211) 
substrate. 
Tungsten has the cubic body centered lattice structure and its (211) face is composed 
of parallel rows and troughs, which run along the <Iii> 
crystallographic 
direction. 
There are 
two inequivalent 
sites for tungsten atoms on this surface, which, together with bulk atom sites, 
produce a three component 
XPS spectrum 
(see Sec. 3A). During 
adsorption 
of metals onto 
W(211), it is expected that the trough sites are filled first, then the sites above the substrate 
atom rows. 
The electronic 
properties 
of transition 
bimetallics 
are determined 
mostly by the 
distribution 
of their d electrons and the interplay 
between d and non-d (s,p) conduction 
bands 
[lO,ll]. 
It has been shown recently that the W(111) surface undergoes massive reconstruction 
upon 
adsorbing a single monolayer of certain metals (including 
Au, Pt and Pd) and annealing. 
The 
resulting 
surface is covered completely 
by three-sided pyramidal 
facets, whose sides are (211) 
planes [12]. 
Ultrathin 
Films on W(21 I) 
119 
In the present work, we report on the growth, thermal stability, 
structure, electronic proper- 
ties and surface reactivity 
of metallic films (Pd, Pt, A u on a W(211) substrate. 
Film thicknesses 
) 
are in the range O-8 monolayers. 
Most of the data are shown for Pd on W(211), although 
Pt 
films have a very similar behaviour. 
Of particular 
interest is the observation, 
using SXPS, that 
an alloy is formed in the surface region upon heating multilayers 
of Pd or Pt to temperatures 
higher than 700 K. In contrast, Au does not form an alloy with W. An unusual enhancement 
of 
chemical activity 
for acetylene cyclization 
over the annnealed Pd/W 
alloy surface is found, in 
comparison with a monolayer or multilayer 
of Pd. 
2. Experimental 
Experiments 
have been performed in two stainless steel ultrahigh 
vacuum chambers at Rut- 
gers University 
and at the National 
Synchrotron 
Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven 
National 
Laboratory, 
on beamline U4A. The chambers have base pressures of 5 1 x 10-l Torr. The Rut- 
gers setup is equipped with an Auger spectrometer, 
LEED optics, quadrupole 
mass spectrometer 
(QMS) and a quartz crystal microbalance. 
The NSLS setup is connected to the UV storage ring 
via a 6-meter toroidal 
grating 
monochromator 
providing 
light in the range lo-200eV. 
Photo- 
electron spectra have been measured with a 100mm VSW hemispherical 
analyser. 
The total 
spectral resolution 
is about 0.2eV at 150eV, and below 0.1 eV at 80eV photon energy. 
The 
excitation 
X-ray beam is incident at 45 degrees with respect to the surface normal and the light 
polarization 
vector does not coincide with any low index crystallographic 
directions of our sam- 
ple. Both setups also contain several metal dosers used for deposition of platinum, 
palladium 
and 
gold. The (211) tungsten substrate is prepared by repetitive 
heating in oxygen (1 x lo- Torr) at 
1300 K, followed by an abrupt increase of substrate temperature 
to 2300 K for a few seconds. The 
cycle is repeated until no traces of carbon can be found in AES spectra. Following this treatment, 
the tungsten sample rarely needs oxygen treatment, 
and it can be cleaned by high temperature 
flashes only. Metal dosers are constructed by wrapping 
thin metal wires (O.l-0.25mm; 
Pt, Au, 
Pd) around a resistively 
heated tungsten filament or by spot-welding 
a piece of foil (Pt) to a 
tungsten wire. Special care is taken to outgas the dosers before their use. Dosers are shielded 
during operation 
by cooled surfaces. The background 
pressure during dosing does not exceed 
2 x lo- 
Torr. 
A variety 
of techniques 
is used throughout 
the present experiments 
to estimate 
surface 
coverages. As discussed below, calibration 
of sources is based on a quartz crystal microbalance

Auger uptake

The only absolute technique employed in this work for determining 
surface coverage is the

of 1 physical monolayer (ML) to 
an accuracy of &I5% 
(corresponding 
to 1.63 x 105atoms/cm2, 
the coverage for which all the 
substrate W atoms in the rows and troughs are covered by overlayer metal atoms). We use the 
QCM data to compare with Auger peak-to-peak 
intensities and TPD spectra in the same vacuum 
chamber. 
The Auger and TPD measurements are used as transfer 
standards 
for coverage 
determination 
in other vacuum chambers, and other indicators 
for identification 
of 1 physical 
ML are also developed. 
For example, in a SXPS experiment, 
several different approaches are 
employed to identify 
formation 
of 1 ML, including 
(a) quenching of surface core level features in 
W(211) spectra, (b) monitoring 
changes in 4f admetal core level spectra with increasing coverage 
(for Au and Pt) [13], and (c) the change of photoelectron 
work function. 
In the following sections, 
more information 
is given about the various methods for coverage determination. 
In order to investigate 
thermally 
activated processes occuring on overlayer films and at the 
interface, stepwise annealing to increasingly 
higher temperatures 
is used: after metal deposition 
the sample is annealed in a sequence of increasing temperatures ranging from 400 to 2300 K. After 
each step the sample is cooled down, and depending on the experiment, 
XPS, AES and LEED 
data are recorded. 
TPD spectra are measured at lOK/sec 
heating rate. 
Photoelectric 
work 
function changes are recorded by the low energy spectrometer 
cutoff signal with a bias voltage 
-5V 
on the target. 
Sample temperature 
is measured by a W5%Re-W26%Re 
thermocouple 
spot-welded to a side of the W crystal. 
3. Results 
and Discussion 
A. Film 
growth 
and thickness 
calibration 
For deposition of Pt onto W(2II) 
at 300 K, the Auger peak-to-peak 
amplitude 
has been measured 
as a function of deposition 
time. Straight line segments with distinct breaks at regular intervals 
are observed (cf. Fig. 1). Each break may be associated with completion of one physical ML, as 
verified with QCM and TPD measurements (see Sec. 3 B). Evidence for layer growth is observed 
to 2 3 ML.

energy of 3 keV. 
A variation 
in the intensity of substrate photoelectron 
peaks has been measured in SXPS of 
W 4fr,s intensities vs. deposition time for Pt, Pd, and Au. See, for example, Fig. 2, for deposition 
of Pd. The upper curve is the W 4fr/s spectrum for a clean W(211); the two peaks at lower binding 
energy (31.1 and 31.3eV) are surface features, and are associated with photoemission 
from row 
and trough atoms respectively. 
The third peak at higher binding 
energy (31.5eV) 
is due to 
bulk W. As the dosing time increases (cf. Fig. 2), the W surface atoms are buried beneath Pd 
atoms, and the surface peaks are attenuated. 
The coverage, at which the surface peaks disappear 
completely, is identified 
as one physical monolayer of Pd. Similar behavior is seen for attenuation 
of surface peaks by monolayers of Pt and Au on W(211). 
Figure 3 shows two series of LEED patterns for films of Pt and Pd as deposited 
at 300 K. 
The persistence of (1 x 1) LEED patterns indicates that overlayer growth is pseudomorphic 
for 
the first two layers. 
As film thickness increases, e.g., for Pd/W(Zll) 
(not shown here), the 
images exhibit 
well defined periodicity 
along the <Iii 
> direction, 
however, they are streaked 
and more diffuse along <Oil 
> (across rows). 
This suggest that the surface is composed of 
atomic chains running parallel to substrate rows. However, these chains (with well-defined atomic 
periodicity 
along them) are randomly terminated 
and, thus, no distinct periodicity 
in the direction 
perpendicular 
to the rows can be seen.

Rows on W(211) surface form channels, along which admetal atoms can diffuse easily. For 
example, 
for palladium 
the activation 
energy for a single jump along the row is 0.32 eV [15]. 
This value is low enough to allow efficient diffusion along rows even at temperatures 
well below 
the room temperature. 
In contrast, 
diffusion of a single admetal atom across the row-trough 
substrate structures 
is inhibited 
by a higher energy barrier, 
and has low probability 
at room 
temperature 
[16]. Note also that Pd and Pt have metallic radii very close to the W substrate 
and, thus, pseudomorphic 
growth may proceed with little stress of the film lattice. 
The remaining 
LEED patterns in Fig. 3 are discussed below.

TPD spectroscopy provides insights into the overlayer coverages and desorption energies. Three 
components 
can be seen in the TPD spectra of palladium 
on W(211) (cf. 
Fig. 4). 
At low 
coverages, up to -0.5 
ML, only a single peak is seen at - 1600K. As Pd coverage increases, a 
second peak develops (- 1400 K) and saturates with increasing dose. Using the QCM, we identify

the coverage corresponding 
to saturation 
of the two peaks at 1400 K and 1600 K as one physical 
monolayer (corresponding 
to 1.63 x 10 
l5 atoms/cm). 
The first peak (at lowest temperature) 
is 
attributed 
to bulk Pd sublimation, 
while the peaks at 1400 K and 1600 K with Pd atoms adsorbed 
on row and trough sites on W(211). The desorption behavior of platinum 
is similar, however, the 
desorption temperatures 
are higher; and the lower temperature 
monolayer peak coincides with 
the bulk TPD peak. Detailed results will appear elsewhere [17]. 
By looking at the sample with SXPS (cf. Figs. 2 and 5), one can study the adsorption 
and 
desorption of Pd from the perspective 
of the W surface. On the as dosed surface, a single 
Pd monolayer leads to suppression of the surface core level (W4f7,s) features (cf. Fig. 2). Upon 
heating the Pd monolayer (cf. Fig. 5), the desorption onset can be seen starting at 1300 K. Further 
annealing steps uncover (at 1400K) th e row tungsten atoms (cf. Fig. 5). Continued 
heating 
to increasingly 
higher temperatures 
produces the clean-tungsten 
three-component 
spectrum 
at 
about 1650 K. The two results (TPD and SXPS) are quite consistent. 
For temperatures 
below 1100 K for palladium, 
and 1700 K for platinum, 
the desorption rate 
is insignificant. 
However, it is clear from AES and SXPS that there are substantial 
changes 
that take place in the surface and interfacial layers. We describe.now the processes occurring on 
overlayers due to annealing, as studied with LEED, AES and SXPS.

5. W 4f photoelectron 
energy spectra from 1 ML Pd on W(211) (annealing 
sequence). 
Photon energy is 85 eV. 
The sequences of LEED images (cf. Fig. 3a to 3c and 3d to 3f), taken for N 2 ML films 
of Pd and Pt, show that the pseudomorphic 
structure of the overlayers is not changed by ther- 
mal treatment. 
Although 
LEED images become sharper with higher contrast when annealing 
temperature 
is increased, there is no qualitative 
change in LEED patterns up to the desorption 
temperatures. 
(The case of submonolayer coverages, where various surface reconstructions 
occur, 
is discussed in [17].) The Auger annealing curves (cf. Fig. 6) h 
s ow stable Auger signal ratios for 
Pd/W, 
for thicknesses of one monolayer and below. This stability 
(seen also for Pt) has been 
assigned to the strong interaction 
of Pt and Pd atoms with the tungsten substrate, 
and to the 
fact that Pt-group 
metals have smaller surface free energies than W; the low energy state in these 
cases is comprised of a wetting layer, where a single monolayer film stays on top of the substrate 
[12,18]. 
For thicker films (2 and 5 ML), there is a substantial 
drop in the values of Auger ratios 
between 500 K and 700 K for palladium, 
and between 800 K and 1100 K for platinum, 
well below 
the temperature, 
at which desorption begins to be observed. Such changes have been observed 
previously 
for Pt and Pd films on W(lll) 
and W(110) surfaces (19-211 and were attributed 
to 
the agglomeration 
into clusters of the overlayer material in excess of one monolayer. 
As discussed 
in Sec. 3 C, this explanation 
does not appear to be consistent in the present case.

Electron 
energy is 3 keV. 
Similar 
to the AES results, photoelectron 
spectroscopy 
shows evidence for stable single 
monolayer films. The annealing sequence for one monolayer coverage is shown in Fig 5. As can 
be seen, the chemical state of tungsten interface atoms remains the same for all temperatures 
below the desorption onset. 
C. Evidence for formation 
of an alloy film 
As shown in Fig. 6 and discussed above, there are considerable changes in AES intensities 
for 
multilayer 
films, at temperatures 
well below the onset of desorption. 
We also find that a new 
feature appears in SXPS spectra when multilayer 
Pd or Pt films are annealed above N 700K 
(cf. Fig. 7). This new peak is shifted N 1 eV towards higher binding energies with respect to 
the bulk W4fr/s peak. 
Moreover, 
it can be seen that the tungsten 
substrate 
peak does not 
change significantly 
in intensity up to 1100 K for Pd. This stability 
indicates that the palladium 
deposit on (211) surface remains flat and does not break into clusters. If clusters were forming at 
temperatures 
below 1100 K, one would expect significant increase of the substrate peak intensity. 
(The bulk W peak attenuated 
by a 5 ML palladium film has less than 10% of the intensity, which 
we would expect for tungsten covered with single monolayer of palladium. 
Based on a simple 
Ultrathin 
Films on W(21 I) 
127 
calculation, 
if only 10% of the surface were uncovered due to the cluster formation, 
the intensity 
of the tungsten peak should increase at least by a factor of two upon annealing. 
If 30% of the 
surface were uncovered, the peak should increase at least by a factor of four.) Thus, the apparent 
absence of Pd cluster formation 
leads to another explanation 
for the appearance of the new peak 
at 32.4eV binding energy (W4fr/s), namely, that tungsten atoms diffuse from the interface into 
the overlayer film. This indicates the formation 
of a palladium-tungsten 
(or platinum-tungsten) 
alloy. The content of tungsten in the overlayer alloy increases with annealing temperature; 
up to 
850 K, the tungsten alloy peak remains at fixed position but its intensity increases. This indicates 
that there is a single chemical state of W atoms in the Pd lattice. 
Under this conditions, 
the 
alloy is very likely dilute, and tungsten atoms are surrounded by host atoms only.

spectra for 5 ML Pd on W (211) (annealing 
sequence). 
Photon 
energy is 145 eV. 
Above 850K, the alloy peak in Fig. 7 shifts to lower binding energy and broadens. 
The 
4f photoemission 
peaks for W atoms in the Pd host are shifted (as compared to bulk W) due 
to chemical interactions. 
It is expected that a W atom surrounded completely 
by unlike atoms 
will experience 
the maximum 
core level shift, while for configurations 
with both like and unlike 
nearest neighbour 
atoms, the resulting core level binding energy should be somewhere between 
128 
J. J. Kdodziej 
et al. 
that of the tungsten 
bulk and the tungsten impurity 
in a palladium 
host. 
Different 
possible 
nearest neighbor configurations 
cause broadening of W 4f photoelectron 
peaks due to disorder 
and Madelung-type 
effects [22]. 
In the simplest view, charge transfer between the valence levels of atoms in an alloy uniformly 
changes the electrostatic 
potential 
in the space occupied by core levels; this causes chemical shifts 
of core electron binding energies. However, in most cases of binary alloys, this simplistic 
attitude 
is not sufficient, 
and even a condition 
that the shift should be in opposite 
directions 
for the 
two alloy components 
is not fulfilled 
(91. Th ere seems to be a general trend in early-d-lated 
transition 
bimetallics, 
that upon bond formation, 
the chemical shifts are in same direction-to 
higher binding energies-for 
both constituents [lo]. Indeed, we have found that the Pt-W system 
follows this trend 1131. C 
orresponding 
data for Pd core levels in the Pd-W 
system cannot be 
measured with our monochromator 
(the 3d Pd levels are beyond our photon energy range, while 
4s and 4p levels are broad and not suitable for SCLS), h 
owever, we expect that Pd should follow 
the same trend for its 3d shallow core level. In fact, such a shift (to higher binding energy) was 
observed by Campbell 
et al. for an annealed 4.5 ML film of Pd on W(llO), 
but it was attributed 
to effects other than alloying 
[18]. 
The work function changes for 8 ML Pd/W(211) 
(see Fig. 8) are correlated with the SXPS 
results of Fig. 7. The work function value does not change substantially 
up to N 800 K. In the 
region 800-1100 K, the work function drops by 0.4 eV; this drop coincides with alloy formation. 
There is a plateau in work function between 1100 K and 1200K, whereas the W 4f,i2 substrate 
peak intensity 
increases substantially 
within 
this range. 
This may be attributed 
to slow des- 
orption of Pd from the alloy, with simultaneous segregation of excess tungsten to the interfacial 
region, so the surface itself remains unchanged. (The limiting 
concentration 
of W in the Pd host 
cannot be exceeded; see discussion below.) The plateau is followed by another significant drop of 
0.2eV, with a simultaneous 
dramatic increase of tungsten signal, which is caused by desorption 
of the multilayer 
palladium 
deposit. The work function then reaches a local minimum, 
which also 
has been observed during growth of Pd and Pt, and has been attributed 
to the single physical 
monolayer coverage. The work function value returns to the value characteristic 
for clean W(211) 
surface after annealing to 1550 K. The changes in W 4fr/2 spectra associated with desorption of 
a single Pd monolayer are shown in Fig. 5. 
Inspection of the Pd-W alloy phase diagram [23] reveals that the solubility 
of Pd in a solid 
W host is rather insignificant: 
below 2at.B. 
On the other hand, W shows significant 
solubility 
in a Pd host. The solubility 
limit is about 22 at.% and is nearly independent 
of temperature.

(The limiting 
value, however, may be different in our case, as we possibly 
have an artificial 
bee palladium 
lattice due to pseudomorphic 
growth.) 
For platinum, 
the overall character of the 
phase diagram is similar, but the solubility 
limit for W in a Pt host is about 60 at.%. Our SXPS 
data for monolayers and multilayers 
of Pt and Pd on W(211) are consistent with the diagrams. 
We have found that one monolayer of Pd on W and of Pt on W is stable with no evidence for 
intermixing. 
Upon annealing multilayers 
of Pd (Pt) on W(211), the data can be interpreted 
to 
indicate that tungsten atoms diffuse into palladium 
and platinum 
lattices. 
Independent 
studies 
show that a Pd (Pt) monolayer film remains on the outer surface to cover the surface alloy [24].

For gold on W(211), no evidence for alloying is found. On a heavily dosed W(211) sample, 
gold tends to form clusters at rather low temperatures 
(- 500 K), as suggested by a significant 
increase in W peak intensity starting at this annealing temperature. 
Simultaneously, 
the intensity 
of Au 4f photoelectron 
peak decreases, and an additional 
peak attributed 
to a single monolayer 
appears. Apart from the Au 4f monolayer peak, no chemical shifts for gold films on W(211) have 
been observed.

Valence band spectra for 5 ML Pd/W(211) 
are presented in Fig. .9a. Both the as dosed 
and the annealed films (to 700 K) exhibit 
an intense peak just below the Fermi level and a 
broader and less intense one about 3 eV below Ep. Upon annealing to 1050 K to form an alloy 
(annealing was done twice to check for saturation), 
a significant change appears. The intensity of 
the peak just below EF dramatically 
decreases. In Fig. 9b, we show a hypothetical 
spectrum of 
a homogeneous mechanical 
22 at.% W + 78 at.% Pd mixture (obtained by a linear combination 
of pure Pd and pure W spectra), and compare it with measured W-Pd 
alloy spectrum. 
As can 
be seen, due to the alloying process intensity 
is transfered from the region O-2eV below EJP 
to 
the region 2-6eV 
below EF. Due to the prevailing 
content of Pd in the alloy, and the rather 
weak W signal, we expect that the recorded valence band spectra reflect mostly the palladium 
band structure.

Electronic 
structure 
of palladium 
has been the subject of intensive theoretical 
and experi- 
mental studies [11,25]. Pd is characterized 
by a system of d-like bands cut through by a broad 
s,p-like band. The Fermi level is situated nearly at the edge of the d band system. In general, 
Ultrathin 
Films on W(211) 
131 
the total density of states (DOS) is dominated 
by the d-like states. At the Fermi level and in 
the region just below EJZ, 
the DOS is almost purely d-like, but in the region 2-7eV 
below the 
Fermi level, there is a noticeable admixture 
of s,p-like DOS. Based on differences in electroneg- 
ativity 
(1.7 for tungsten and 2.2 for palladium), 
one might expect a charge transfer to tungsten 
atoms upon alloying. 
Bzowski and Sham [lo] investigated 
a chemically 
similar early-d-late-d 
transition 
alloy (Pd-Ti) 
by XPS and XANES. 
They found that alloying causes rehybridization 
of the palladium 
valence band structure. 
As a result of this process, Pd gains s,p electrons and 
loses d electrons. 
The net charge transfer onto the Pd site is negative, so the electronegativity 
condition is fulfilled; 
nevertheless, the Pd 3d core level energy shift is in the direction opposite to 
the simplistic 
prediction 
of the charge transfer model. The depletion of intensity 
in the valence 
band spectrum upon alloying strongly suggests a similar behaviour of the Pd-W system. 
A sophisticated 
local density formalism has been applied by Wu and Freeman [26] to study 
interaction 
of palladium 
monolayers on different early transition 
metals (Ta, W, Re). They find 
that electron density is depleted from around outer regions of substrate 
atoms and from the 
central regions of palladium 
atoms, which is in line with the s,p --+ d rehybridisation 
process. 
D. Catalytic 
properties 
of Pd/W(211) 
To understand 
the structure-reactivity 
relationship 
on bimetallic 
surfaces, acetylene cyclization 
to form benzene, a known structure-sensitive 
reaction, 
is of particular 
interest 
127,281. TPD 
results exhibit 
negligible 
amounts of benzene formation on a clean W(211). 
A single monolayer 
of Pd on W(211) decreases the high reactivity 
towards acetylene decomposition 
and increases the 
propensity 
towards benzene product formation 
(see Fig. 10). I ncreasing the Pd film thickness 
to N 6 ML causes large changes in benzene product distributions 
formed from 3 L of acetylene 
(1 L = 110 Torr . s). The integrated benzene yield decreases by more than 50%, in comparison 
to the 1 ML Pd covered surface. 
A more detailed discussion of &Hz 
reactions on these two 
surfaces is presented elsewhere [29]. 
In contrast to the above, heating a 6 ML Pd/W 
surface to 1050K results in a surprising 
five-fold increase in benzene yield from acetylene cyclization, 
as compared to the 1 ML Pd/W 
surface (cf. Fig. 10). As shown in Figs. 9a and 9b, annealing a multilayer 
Pd/W(211) 
surface 
causes a striking 
change in surface electronic structure due to surface alloy formation. 
Whereas 
annealing of multilayer 
Pd/W 
leads to alloy formation, 
a single monolayer of Pd/W(211) 
does 
132 
J. J. Kolodziej et al. 
not form a surface alloy. The lower desorption temperatures of benzene (150 K, 180 K, and 270 K) 
and the five-fold increased benzene yields on the 1050K preannealed 6 ML Pd/W(211) 
surface, 
apparently 
result from the Pd-W alloy formed at the Pd/W interface.

4. Conclusions 
The bimetallic 
systems Pd-W, Pt-W, and Au-W have been studied with LEED, AES, TPD, 
and SXPS. The admetals form pseudomorphic 
films on W(211). 
Single monolayers 
of these 
admetals are very stable against thermally 
activated 
rearrangement. 
This may be attributed 
to minimization 
of surface free energy upon formation 
of the monolayer 
and strong chemical 
interactions 
between early-d-late-d 
transition 
metal atoms. 
Thick (2-8 ML) films of Pd and 
Pt undergo alloying 
with the W substrate 
during annealing. 
In accordance with alloy phase 
diagrams, it appears that tungsten atoms diffuse into the overlayer. A substantial 
rearrangement 
of the valence band of Pd, consistent with the core level shifts of W and Pt, has been observed. 
This suggests charge transfer from W to Pd/Pt, 
accompanied by rehybridization 
of the valence 
bands, and intra-atomic 
s,p -+ d charge transfer in Pt group metal atoms. 
No evidence for 
clustering 
of Pt or Pd films has been found. 
On the contrary, 
in Au-W 
system no alloying

is found, but cluster formation 
occurs upon annealing.

to the chemical activity 
of a 
W-Pd saturated 
alloy.
