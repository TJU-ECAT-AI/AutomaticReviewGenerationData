Thin film growth of Pt on Rh(
): a LEIS study
Abstract
Low energy Li+ ion scattering has been used to study ultrathin Pt films deposited at room temperature on Rh(1 0 0). The Pt atoms are seen to adsorb into the top layer of the Rh(1 0 0) substrate residing in face-centered-cubic (fcc) sites thereby forming a surface alloy. Through the use of specific scattering geometries to isolate first and second layer contributions, Pt was seen to grow in a layer-by-layer fashion for at least the first two layers. This was confirmed by analysing the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects as a function of growth. Finally, the thermal stability of the deposited Pt was investigated. The Pt was seen to diffuse into the bulk of the Rh(1 0 0) crystal at approximately 700 K. We believe this is due to C contamination as a consequence of the heating process.
1. Introduction
Platinum and Rhodium are two widely used materials in industry and together form the so called three-way-catalyst which can simultaneously remove hydrocarbons, CO and NOx from automobile exhaust gases
[1]
. The catalytic nature of these two materials has created interest concerning Pt–Rh alloy and bimetallic surfaces to investigate the reasons for the catalytic activity. A particularly active surface has been found to be the p(3 × 1)O/Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface which is obtained by heating Pt/Rh(1 0 0) in oxygen
[2]
. To prepare this surface in UHV, Pt must first be deposited on the Rh(1 0 0) substrate and hence the nature of the growth is of interest.
To study the growth, low energy ion scattering (LEIS) has been employed. LEIS is a powerful surface sensitive technique which is capable of determining chemical species and structure in real space
[3]
. Its surface sensitivity is due to the high neutralisation probability of noble gas ions if they penetrate the surface layer, and large cross-sections for the ion atom collision. LEIS has been used by various groups to study growth mainly by exploiting the surface sensitivity to obtain first layer information
[4]
, and using shadowing features of the technique to isolate backscattered yield from specific surface layers
[5]
. We use alkali ions along specific scattering geometries to measure the first and second layer chemical compositions. Polar scans utilising shadowing features can provide information on third and fourth layer atoms also.
Epitaxial growth of metals on metals generally proceeds via one of three growth modes FM, SK or VW, named after the authors that first considered them
[6]
: Frank–van der Merwe (monolayer-by-monlayer), Stranski and Krastanov (monolayer then 3D crystallite growth), and Volmer and Weber (3D crystallite growth without a preceding adsorbed layer). The growth mode is governed by thermodynamic and kinetic factors dependent on the substrate/adsorbate combination. A simple approximation of the different growth modes can be formulated in terms of surface energy criteria
[7]
. If the adsorbate has a surface energy γA, the substrate a surface energy γS, and the interface between the two an energy γI, then Δγ=γA+γI−γS⩽0 will favour FM growth while Δγ=γA+γI−γS>0 will favour the SK or VW mode. The main problem with this formula is that values for γI are rarely known. We will show that the experimentally determined growth mode is in agreement with calculations based on the preceding formulation.
The growth of submonolayer Pt on Rh(1 0 0) has been investigated by Ramstad et al. with high resolution photoemission
[8]
. The Pt atoms were observed to assemble as single layer islands which coalesce into large islands after annealing at 300 °C. We investigate the room temperature growth of up to four layers of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface which are accessible by LEIS. The thermal stability of the adsorbed Pt is then investigated. Tanaka reported that the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface was stable up to a temperature of 1000 K with the Pt remaining in the surface region
[9]
. However, our layer specific measurements show a Rh enrichment in the surface layers after annealing. Pt–Rh alloys generally show a Pt surface enrichment upon annealing
[10]
although it has been shown that surface cleanliness is critical for these measurements
[11]
. In a similar fashion, we believe that surface contamination during the annealing process influences the surface Pt concentration.
2. Experimental
The angle resolved ion scattering system, Colutron ion source and experimental method have been described previously
[12]
. The UHV chamber was equipped with a three-grid LEED unit and maintained a base pressure of ∼2 × 10−10 mbar. The 2 keV Li+ ions for ion scattering analysis were focused, mass analysed and collimated into a beam ∼3 mm in diameter at a current of ∼1 nA. The scattered ions were energy analysed by a hemispherical electrostatic analyser with multichannel detection.
Platinum was deposited via a home-built evaporator source which consisted of ultra high purity Pt wire being resistively heated with DC current. The Rh(1 0 0) sample was initially cleaned by Ar+ bombardment (0.5 μA) and annealed resulting in a clear (1 × 1) LEED pattern with low background.
3. Results and discussion
The Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface was initially investigated using grazing incidence azimuthal scans. These scans provide information on the short range order of the surface and give maxima and minima depending on the interatomic spacing in the aligned azimuth
[3]
.
Fig. 1
shows the azimuthal dependence of the scattered Li+ ion signal from both Rh and Pt for the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface after depositing Pt for 1, 2, and 3 min onto the clean Rh(1 0 0) surface. Although we have no accurate determination of the concentration at this stage, it was estimated (and later verified) that after depositing for 1 min, there was approximately 0.5 ML of Pt on the surface.

Fig. 1. Grazing incidence azimuthal scans from submonolayer Pt/Rh(1 0 0) using 2 keV Li+ ions (α=12° (where α is the angle of incidence of the beam to the surface), θ=110° (where θ is the scattering angle)) after incremental exposures of Pt: (top) 1 min, (middle) 2 min, (bottom) 3 min.
The azimuthal dependence is clearly the same for Rh and Pt as the crystal is rotated through the three major close packed directions and thus we can say that the Pt atoms reside in face-centred-cubic (fcc) sites. The LEED pattern was also observed (not shown) to remain (1 × 1) thus ruling out any reconstruction upon Pt adsorption. It is further noted that even after depositing Pt for only 1 min on the sample, the shadowing of Pt atoms is very strong. If the Pt atoms remained above the surface Rh layer, we would expect very minor Pt–Pt shadowing and hence shallow minima at the location of low index directions of the substrate. Additionally, we should also see a strong attenuation of the Rh signal due to shadowing of the substrate by the adsorbed Pt overlayer which was not observed.
The strong Pt shadowing at low coverages could be compatible with Pt forming an overlayer where the deposited Pt forms compact islands. However, the azimuthal scan after 3 min of Pt deposition suggests that the Pt is replacing Rh in the surface layer due to the loss of order observed in the Rh signal which could be expected for displaced Rh atoms. The loss of order is observed in the azimuthal scan as a lessening of the difference in the maxima and minima in the scattered signal as the crystal is rotated through different azimuthal alignments. If the Rh atoms remained in fcc sites with a Pt overlayer forming above it, no loss of order should be observed in the Rh yield. The loss of order is especially evident in the 〈1 0 0〉 azimuth and this may suggest that the displaced Rh atoms are forming rows in the 〈1 1 0〉 azimuth. Thus we believe that most if not all of the adsorbed Pt is incorporated into at least the first layer of Rh atoms forming a surface alloy. This is in agreement with a recent finding that surface intermixing of adsorbate and substrate should be regarded as the rule rather than the exception
[13]
. After 3 min deposition, the Pt signal shows strong shadowing features without annealing the surface. This shows that the Pt is well ordered in fcc sites and the surface is largely free of impurities.
The growth of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface was then quantitatively investigated by ion scattering after incremental adsorption of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) substrate from the gas phase. The composition of the first and second layers can be determined by measuring the scattered intensities from specific geometries. The chosen scattering geometries, as illustrated in
Fig. 2
, were:
(i)
α=45°, θ=90° along the 〈1 0 0〉 direction. In this geometry, single scattering can only occur from atoms in the outermost atomic layer since all sub-surface atoms are completely shadowed and blocked by the first layer atoms.
(ii)
α=35°, θ=90° along the 〈1 1 0〉 direction. Similarly, in this geometry single scattering will only occur from first and second layer atoms with all deeper layer atoms shadowed and blocked.

Scattering from first layer only (top), scattering from only first and second layers (bottom). The smaller atoms shown in the bottom geometry signify second layer atoms which do not lie in the plane defined by the first and third layer atoms.
Buck et al. used these geometries to investigate the Ni(0 0 1) surface with Ne
[14]
. We have used an alkali ion (Li+) instead of a noble gas due to the smaller neutralisation probabilities associated with alkali ion scattering as compared to noble gases. Similarly, Shen et al. used selective geometries to determine first and second layer chemical compositions from a Cu3Pt(1 1 1) surface with Li+
[12]
.
The surface concentration CA of component A using geometry (i) is given by
[15]
(1)
where IA is the scattered signal intensity (area below the peak) from chemical species A, NAS is the number of surface atoms per unit area on the pure element standard and IAS is the scattered signal intensity from the pure element standard. Second layer concentrations can then be determined using geometry (ii) and Eq.
(2)
[15]
(2)
where I1A and I1+2A are the ion signals from species A in geometries (i) and (ii), respectively, and
is the ratio of enhancement of second layer scattering due to focusing by first layer atoms for atom species A and B.
The assumption in this analysis is that the ion survival probability for scattering from an atom is independent of its chemical environment
[16]
. The variance of the signal from the same element depending on its chemical surrounding has been termed matrix effects. A prediction for the absence or presence of matrix effects in LEIS is very difficult to determine
[17]
. To investigate whether matrix effects were present for the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface, a plot of the scattered intensities, IPt versus IRh, was made as a function of Pt deposition. The lack of a linear relationship between these quantities could be a result of a variety of factors, however, the demonstration of linear dependence will show that absence of matrix effects
[18]
.
Fig. 3
displays the absolute values of the Pt and Rh LEIS signals for the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) bimetallic surface at various coverages of Pt. The data is presented when observing Pt and Rh absolute yields from the top two surface layers (α=35°, θ=90° along 〈1 1 0〉). The demonstration of a linear relationship between these quantities shows the absence of matrix effects. This is true for first and second layer atoms. Thus the surface concentrations of Pt and Rh on the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface can be calculated as a function of Pt adsorption using Eqs.

The clean Rh(1 0 0) surface was used to determine IRhS, however no Pt(1 0 0) surface was available to measure IPtS. A Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface was used instead with greater than 3 ML of Pt deposited. It is possible that the Pt film may be pseudomorphic with the substrate and thus the lattice constants may be the same. The 3% difference in the Pt and Rh lattice constants could produce a small error (∼1%) in IPtS if the growing film is pseudomorphic. Polar scans with Li+ were performed to determine the interatomic spacing and hence the lattice constant, however, the error in the measurement was too large to resolve such a small change.

, respectively. The sample was dosed in 30 second windows and the energy spectrum was obtained in the two geometries before the sample was again dosed. We estimate the error in the percentages in
Fig. 4
to be ±10% mainly because the Rh–Rh double scattering (E/E0=0.924) and Rh–Pt double scattering (E/E0=0.941) peaks were energetically very close to the Pt single scattering peak (E/E0=0.931) and therefore, these double scattering peaks could be mistakenly interpreted as Pt single scattering.

However,
Fig. 4
provides strong support for Pt growing in a layer-by-layer fashion on the Rh(1 0 0) substrate. The first layer Pt signal increases and saturates at about two and a half minutes. At this point the second layer Pt starts to increase linearly and saturates at about 5 min deposition. Assuming that the deposition rate is reasonably constant over this time period reveals that we are depositing at a rate of a monolayer every two and a half minutes. If the growth was not layer-by-layer, the second layer Pt signal would not linearly increase and saturate at the previously stated times due to not all Rh atoms being shadowed by three dimensional Pt structures.
The growth of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface was then investigated using polar scans. To do this, the relative contribution of each subsurface layer to the subsurface polar peaks needed to be determined. For this assessment, SARIC
[19]
polar simulations were performed on a Rh(1 0 0) surface with the number of layers in the sample varied from one to six. The potential used in the simulations was the Universal potential
[20]
. The contribution to each peak from layer n was evaluated by subtracting the polar scan with n−1 layers from the scan with n layers. The result for the 〈2 1 0〉 direction is shown in
Fig. 5
. No significant contribution was recorded for layers below the fourth layer and hence these are not included in the graph. Along the 〈2 1 0〉 direction the second layer results in a peak at 36°, while third and fourth layer contributions give a peak at 40–42°. Similar analysis was performed in the 〈1 1 0〉 azimuth. In this direction third layer contributions result in a peak at 37° while fourth layer atoms give a peak at 40°.

Fig. 6
shows the experimental polar scans of the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface as a function of Pt deposition. Unfortunately
Fig. 4
and
Fig. 6
cannot be compared as the Pt deposition rate on different days seemed to vary in spite of the effort to keep the deposition parameters constant. After 6 min deposition we see very little Pt in the second layer from the 〈2 1 0〉 direction and no third and fourth layer contribution. After 8 min however, we can clearly see second layer Pt in
Fig. 6a
while
Fig. 6b
shows the absence of third and fourth layer Pt. After 12 min deposition, the 〈2 1 0〉 scan shows we have Pt in third and fourth layer while the 〈1 1 0〉 scan would suggest it is in the third layer. After 20 min, both directions give strong fourth layer Pt contributions. During the adsorption experiment shown in
Fig. 6
, we estimate that the deposition rate is a monolayer every 5 min.

The epitaxial growth of one metal on another is determined not only by surface energy considerations but by the kinetics of the growing film as well. The system is generally far from thermodynamic equilibrium. However, a local equilibrium will be established in the surface region which will reflect the energetics of the system. The surface energy of the Rh(1 0 0) surface is 2.799 J m−2 while for Pt(1 0 0) it is 2.734 J m−2
[21]
. Now if it is assumed that the interfacial energy is small for Pt/Rh(1 0 0), γI≈0, then we have Δγ⩽0 which predicts monolayer by monolayer growth in agreement with the experimental results. The small geometrical differences in lattice constants and atomic radii for Pt and Rh would suggest that γI is small although no definite conclusions can be made.
Finally, we investigated the thermal stability of a monolayer of Pt adsorbed on the Rh(1 0 0) surface.
Fig. 7
displays the Pt in the first atomic layer obtained using geometry (i), while Pt in the second layer is also shown obtained using geometry (ii). The data was collected by heating 1 ML Pt/Rh(1 0 0) to the desired temperature for 5 min before letting the sample cool to below 350 K and then taking the energy spectrum. The Pt overlayer will now be referred to as the first layer with the uppermost Rh layer being referred to as the second layer. Between 300 and 700 K there seems to be a reasonably uniform migration of Pt from the first layer diffusing into the second layer. At 700 K we have roughly 80% Pt in the first layer and approximately 20% in the second layer indicating that we have not lost any Pt out of the top two layers. However between 700 and 900 K, the Pt is rapidly lost from the first and second layers until there is negligible Pt in the two top layers at or after 1000 K. This result does not agree with Tanaka who found that the Pt/Rh(1 0 0) surface was stable after heating to 1000 K in UHV for 20 min with the Pt remaining in the surface region
[9]
,
[22]
. The Pt is either evaporating from the surface or moving into the bulk. We can rule out Pt evaporation as Williams and Nelson found that at 1500 K less than 1 ML of Pt or Rh is evaporated from a Pt–Rh alloy crystal per hour
[23]
. The question is now why is the Pt diffusing into the bulk.

Although we are studying Pt/Rh bimetallic surfaces, impurity induced diffusion studies of Pt/Rh alloy surfaces may provide an answer as to why the Pt is diffusing into the Rh(1 0 0) sample. Studies of Pt–Rh alloys generally result in Pt surface enrichment as temperature increases
[10]
. A recent study of the Pt25Rh75(1 0 0) crystal showed that Pt segregated to the surface from the second to fourth layers giving a surface Pt concentration of 80% after annealing to 600 °C
[11]
. It is known that heating Pt/Rh(1 0 0) in O2 causes Rh segregation, however we don't believe this is happening here as when we heat the surface in O2, the segregation occurs at a much lower temperature. However, it has also been seen that C impurities on the Pt–Rh alloy causes the surface concentration of Pt to drop dramatically. After annealing to 500 °C with an estimated C contamination of only 2%, the Pt surface concentration of the Pt25Rh75(1 0 0) crystal was 60%
[11]
. To test for C contamination, we heated the clean Rh(1 0 0) surface from room temperature to 1100 K in 200 K steps checking the C and O contamination with He scattering after letting the sample cool back to room temperature. We observed that the C surface contamination increased with increasing temperature as C segregated from the bulk. Using crude techniques, based solely on the differential cross-section for ion scattering to calculate surface coverages, we estimate that at 1100 K we have approximately 10% C on the surface. Assuming that the adsorbed monolayer of Pt does not affect the C segregation from the bulk, we believe this is the reason for the rapid decrease to zero in our surface Pt concentration. The C on the surface causes the less noble metal (Rh) to segregate in preference to Pt. The C on the surface would also introduce error into the quantitative analysis of the top two layers as the C would start to shadow the surface metal atoms. Unfortunately an estimation of the C contamination could not be made from the Li+ energy spectra. The high background intensity due to the low neutralisation probability, combined with the low cross-section for scattering, did not allow the C signal to be distinguishable from the low energy background.
It is interesting to note that the Pt has completely disappeared from the surface and not just been reduced as was the case for the alloy. The relatively high C concentration would suggest that the higher the C concentration, the stronger the segregation is for the less noble metal. This effect, however, does not show a linear relationship. The carbon contamination was seen to linearly increase with temperature after 500 K but the Rh segregation rapidly accelerates at 700 K after the Pt concentration has reached a critical value of approximately 10%.
4. Conclusions
We have investigated the deposition, growth and thermal stability of ultrathin layers of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface. The Pt was seen to adsorb in fcc sites and be incorporated into the Rh(1 0 0) surface layer. Using special geometries and polar scans, the growth was seen to be layer-by-layer for at least the first two monolayers. Finally, the thermal stability of the Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface was investigated The adsorbed Pt was observed to diffuse into the bulk of the single crystal sample at 700 K, although we believe this is due to C contamination as a consequence of heating the crystal.
