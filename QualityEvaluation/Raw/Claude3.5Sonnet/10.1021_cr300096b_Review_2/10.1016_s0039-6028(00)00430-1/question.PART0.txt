CO adsorption on the Pt/Rh(100) surface studied by high-resolution photoemission
Abstract
Submonolayers of platinum have been deposited on an Rh(100) substrate. Platinum growth and subsequent CO adsorption on the bimetallic surface has been studied by high-resolution photoemission applying synchrotron radiation. Platinum was found to grow as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100). The CO adsorption site on both metals is very sensitive to compositional changes in the bimetallic surface. A site switch from on-top to bridge sites in the c(2×2) CO overlayer on Rh(100) has been observed in the presence of 0.2 monolayers (ML) of platinum. The CO saturation coverage is found to decrease dramatically with increasing platinum coverages. 0.9 ML of platinum on Rh(100) binds approximately half the CO bound by Pt(100). We explain this in terms of a reduced COPt bond strength through a ligand effect.
1. Introduction
Platinumrhodium bimetallic catalysts are used in a number of chemical reactions. Among the most important is the three-way catalyst used to remove hydrocarbons, NOx and CO from automotive exhaust gas. The catalytic properties of these metals have triggered numerous surface science studies of clean and adsorbate-covered platinum and rhodium surfaces, as well as PtRh bimetallic surfaces.
The presence of a secondary metal in bimetallic systems alters the physical and chemical properties of these surfaces compared with the corresponding single-metal systems (see, e.g.,
[1]
and references therein). CO adsorbed on platinum overlayers on, for example, Cu(111)
[2]
, Nb(110)
[3]
and Mo(110)
[4]
is found to desorb at lower temperatures than CO adsorbed on Pt(111). Studies of Cu/Rh(100)
[5]
,
[6]
and Fe/Rh(100)
[7]
have shown that the rhodium substrate changes the electronic structure and reactivity of copper and iron, respectively. For the Cu/Rh(100) system, the valence d-band and the copper core levels are shifted to lower binding energy as a consequence of the interaction between copper and rhodium. This interaction causes CO to be more strongly bound to the copper adlayer as compared to CO on Cu(100)
[5]
,
[6]
. In the Fe/Rh(100) case, increased d-band binding energy and reduced hydrogen bonding are observed
[7]
. These observations are consistent with results obtained for other systems
[1]
. Theoretical calculations have shown that the position of the d-band center is a determining parameter for the CO chemisorption energy on transition metal surfaces and overlayers
[8]
. In the present work, we have studied CO adsorption on the Pt/Rh(100) surface to learn how the CO interaction with platinum and rhodium is affected by the presence of the other metal.
We have recently published a study of CO adsorption on the Rh(100) surface
[9]
. Here, CO adsorption sites were determined for three overlayer phases by means of high-resolution photoemission, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and photoelectron diffraction. In what follows we present a corresponding study of CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100). Platinum is found to grow as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100). It will be shown that CO adsorption on the rhodium and platinum patches of the bimetallic surface is different from that on Rh(100) and Pt(100), respectively. The CO saturation coverage of CO on 0.9 monolayers (ML) of platinum on Rh(100) is strongly reduced compared with that on Pt(100), which implies a reduced bond strength between CO and platinum also for the present bimetallic system. In addition, the CO adsorption site, on both metals, is found to be very sensitive to the composition of the surface.
2. Experimental
The high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed at beamline 22 of the MAX I storage ring in Lund, Sweden. This beamline is equipped with a large, hemispherical, electron-energy analyzer (Scienta) and a modified Zeiss SX-700 monochromator
[10]
. The overall resolution in the measurements of the Pt 4f level was better than 60 meV. For the C 1s and Rh 3d levels, the resolution was approximately 250 meV. Binding energies were calibrated by measuring the position of the Fermi edge after each spectrum. All spectra were recorded near normal emission, accepting electrons from a cone of 30. The rhodium crystal was cooled to 100 K during photoemission measurements.
The sample was cleaned by cycles of Ar+-ion sputtering at 900 K, heating at 7001100 K in 108 Torr oxygen for 10 min and finally annealing in vacuum at 1400 K. The sample was heated by passing current through the tungsten wire to which it was mounted. Its temperature was measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple spot-welded to the rear of the sample. This procedure gave a clean and well-ordered Rh(100) surface as evidenced by LEED and photoemission of the core and valence regions of the most likely contaminants.
Platinum was deposited, with the sample at room temperature (RT), from a water-cooled source containing a resistively heated platinum filament of purity 99.99%. During platinum deposition the pressure in the preparation chamber rose to 1×109 Torr. Deposition times were typically a few minutes. The base pressure in the preparation chamber was 3×1010 Torr. After platinum deposition or CO dosing the sample was therefore quickly transferred to the analysis chamber, where the pressure was 1×1010 Torr. Again, the surface cleanliness was routinely checked by photoemission. Trace amounts of CO were found after platinum deposition. By comparison with known CO overlayers, we estimate the CO contamination to cover less than 1% of the surface.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Platinum growth on Rh(100)
Platinum coverages are estimated from photoemission intensities by the same method as applied in Ref.
[11]
, setting the attenuation from a platinum monolayer equal to a factor of 0.5 (the same as for a monolayer of rhenium). Complementary estimates based on the attenuation of the Rh 3d5/2 surface component agree well with this method. We estimate our absolute coverages to be accurate to within 20%.
Fig. 1
shows Pt 4f7/2 spectra for various platinum adlayers on Rh(100) and for a clean Pt(111) surface. The solid lines show fits to the spectra by DoniachSunji (DS) functions
[12]
with Gaussian broadening. Because of a sharp peak in the density of states at the Fermi level, the DS theory, which assumes a constant density of states at the Fermi level, is strictly speaking not valid for platinum
[13]
. We see, however, that a quite good fit is achieved for the Pt(111) spectrum (
upper curve
) and an excellent fit is achieved for the single-component Pt/Rh(100) spectrum (
second from top
). The Lorentzian and Gaussian widths are taken to be the same for Pt/Rh(100) as previously used for Pt(111)
[11]
, while the asymmetry factor is reduced slightly. The
two spectra at the bottom of Fig. 1
are recorded from as-deposited platinum films, of 0.5 and 0.9 ML, on Rh(100). To fit these spectra, three platinum components are used with binding energies of approximately 70.65, 71.00 and 71.25 eV. The same three components are used (and indeed required) to fit the Pt 4f7/2 spectra for all our as-deposited platinum films. Although the component at 71.25 eV coincides with a CO-on-Pt component, we do not believe this to be caused by a CO contamination in this case since no CO-related features are observed in the corresponding valence-band spectra. In order to identify these components we make comparisons with the corresponding spectra from Pt(111) (
upper spectrum
) and an annealed platinum film (
second from top
). We first note that none of the components used has a binding energy as low as the Pt(111) surface component (at 70.5 eV
[11]
). Since platinum and rhodium are similar metals with the same crystal structure and only a 3% lattice mismatch, we expect submonolayer platinum films on Rh(100) to have a structure very similar to an unreconstructed Pt(100) surface. This surface would be more open than Pt(111) and is thus expected to have a larger surface core-level shift (SCLS) than Pt(111). Unfortunately, this SCLS has never been measured because the (100) surface of platinum reconstructs into a very dense quasi-hexagonal structure with a SCLS smaller than that of Pt(111)
[14]
. LEED always shows a (1×1) pattern after platinum deposition, ruling out the possibility of a reconstructed overlayer. The lack of a component with binding energy as low as the Pt(111) surface component is taken as evidence that no second-layer platinum is grown before the completion of the first monolayer. All of the deposited platinum is in contact with rhodium, causing a shift towards higher binding energy. It has been shown previously in the case of Re/Pt(111) that chemically different species may exist in as-deposited, single-layer islands; i.e., a center and an edge species
[11]
. In the center of islands there is a one-to-one ratio between substrate and overlayer atoms, whereas around the perimeter there are more substrate atoms for each overlayer atom, providing a larger chemical shift. It is thus possible that the three components used for the as-deposited films are (from lower to higher binding energy) center, edge and corner (or lower coordinated) atoms, respectively. As we see, the lowest-energy component becomes dominant when the first monolayer is approached. This is reasonable for a center component when islands begin to coalesce. Looking at the spectrum from a 0.1 ML platinum film annealed at 300C (
Fig. 1, second from top
), we see that only the center component is present. This would imply a preference for large islands and a low barrier for surface diffusion. The latter is confirmed by field ion microscopy (FIM) experiments
[15]
. If the surface platinum started diffusing into the rhodium bulk at 300C, higher rhodium coordination for each platinum atom would result. From the reasoning above, this implies that we would observe an even larger platinum core-level shift towards higher binding energy. Such behavior has been observed upon annealing of the Re/Pt(111) system
[11]
. The fact that it is the low-binding-energy component that survives the annealing for the present system indicates that the platinum stays on the surface. This is in agreement with earlier reports that inter-diffusion is slow below 900 K for Pt0.25Rh0.75(100) and Rh/Pt(100)
[16]
. For Pt0.25Rh0.75(100), platinum segregation was found for temperatures as low as 300C
[17]
. After annealing, a platinum-enriched surface layer and platinum-depleted second layer were observed for all of these platinumrhodium systems
[16]
,
[17]
. Thus we believe that platinum grows as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100) and that these islands coalesce into much larger islands when the surface is annealed at 300C.

For the platinum films, their relative normalized spectral intensities are reflected in the ratios between the corresponding film thicknesses. The two bottom spectra are from as-deposited platinum films of 0.5 and 0.9 ML on Rh(100). Second from top: 0.1 ML Pt/Rh(100) annealed at 300C. Top: from a clean Pt(111) crystal, showing surface and bulk components.
Fig. 2
shows the Rh 3d5/2 signal from an Rh(100) surface, before (bottom) and after depositing small amounts of platinum. The clean surface spectrum is decomposed excellently into two DS components, the surface component with 0.65 eV lower binding energy than the bulk component. This SCLS is in good agreement with previously published values of 0.62 eV
[18]
and 0.66 eV
[19]
. We find, as did Zacchigna et al.
[19]
, that the surface component is slightly broader than the bulk peak. This is accounted for by an increased Gaussian width on the surface component. The
two middle spectra of Fig. 2
are recorded after deposition of 0.05 and 0.1 ML of platinum. We see that a decomposition into two components leads to a largely reduced SCLS with increasing platinum coverage. In the 0.1 ML case the splitting between the two components is 0.45 eV. For higher platinum coverages the surface component only appears as a shoulder on the low-binding-energy side of the bulk component. Upon annealing to 300C the low-energy component moves back towards, but never reaches, the binding energy observed for the clean surface. Decomposition of the Rh 3d5/2 spectra into three peaks, however, keeping the position of the surface component fixed, leads to a very large component at intermediate binding energy. This is shown in the case of the 0.05 ML film in the
upper curve in Fig. 2
. The new component cannot be platinum-derived since it has acquired approximately 80% of the weight of the surface component. It also seems unlikely that a contamination should cover 80% of the surface. The most likely contamination would be hydrogen, which causes a core-level shift on Rh(100) that coincides fairly well with the energy position of the third component in the upper curve in
Fig. 2
[20]
. However, in order to reach a hydrogen coverage of 0.8, a dose of approximately 3 L (1 L=106 Torr s) is required
[20]
,
[21]
. The ambient gas exposure in the present experiments is much lower.
2
Along with the fact that the third peak shifts towards higher binding energy with increasing platinum coverage, the low gas exposure makes an explanation of the apparently reduced SCLS in terms of a contamination very unlikely. We thus interpret our Rh 3d5/2 spectra to consist of two components with the energy position of the surface component being very sensitive to the amount of platinum deposited on the surface. The annealing experiment suggests that the as-deposited, small platinum islands affect the surface rhodium atoms more strongly than the larger platinum islands formed after annealing. It is, however, puzzling that such small amounts of platinum should cause what appears to be a collective effect on the entire surface. No adsorbate-induced surface reconstruction was observed by LEED.

3.2. CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100)
Before turning to the results of CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100), it is useful to recap some of our earlier findings for CO/Rh(100)
[9]
. For CO coverages between 0.2 and 0.6 ML we observe a c(2×2) overlayer by LEED. This structure, which is saturated at 0.5 ML, is found to contain CO predominantly adsorbed in on-top sites, identified by a C 1s binding energy of 285.85 eV. Exposures of 0.5 to 1.0 L at RT will result in this structure. At 10 L exposure at RT, a
structure is formed. This structure saturates at 0.75 ML and contains predominantly CO in bridge sites with a C 1s binding energy of 285.45 eV. Finally, dosing 100 L at 0C yields a c(6×2) structure saturating at 0.83 ML. It was found that this structure contains on-top and bridge sites in close to a one-to-one ratio.
We are now ready to discuss the CO/Pt/Rh(100) system.
Fig. 3
shows the C 1s spectrum for CO adsorbed on Pt/Rh(100) for various platinum coverages. After platinum deposition the surface was saturated with CO (50 L) at RT. The corresponding spectrum for the c(6×2) structure for CO/Rh(100) is included for comparison (
bottom
). The decomposition of this spectrum into two Gaussian-broadened DS components has been described previously
[9]
. We use the same two components when decomposing the spectra for CO/Pt/Rh(100), but find that two more are required. These are interpreted as CO in on-top (higher binding energy) and bridge (lower binding energy) sites on platinum. For the two new components we use the same fitting parameters as in the CO/Rh case except for the asymmetry parameter on the on-top-Pt component, which has been more than doubled. We find that this is necessary in order to fit the high-energy tail, and that it is in agreement with earlier results for CO/Pt(111) where an even higher asymmetry was used for the on-top component in order to account for vibrational excitations
[22]
. The positions of all the components are kept fixed within 0.05 eV except in the 0.9 ML case (upper spectrum), where the bridge-Pt component is shifted 0.12 eV towards lower binding energy. It is possible to use this position also for the 0.5 ML spectrum, but only if the width of that component is increased considerably (by 30%). Since the 0.9 ML spectrum is dominated by two nearly resolved components, we choose to present the binding energy positions from this spectrum as our best results for CO on platinum on Rh(100): on-top at approximately 286.40 eV and bridge at 286.00 eV. The splitting between the two components is nearly the same for CO/Rh(100) and CO/Pt/Rh(100) (or slightly larger in the latter case), and both components are shifted by approximately 0.55 eV towards higher binding energy in the latter case. In order to describe the effect of the rhodium substrate, we should like to compare these binding energies with those of CO/Pt(100)
[23]
. In the only photoemission experiment we know of for this system, a single C 1s peak at 286.4 eV was reported for molecularly adsorbed CO
[23]
. This coincides exactly with our value for on-top adsorbed CO on 1 ML Pt/Rh(100). However, due to the lack of resolution in the CO/Pt(100) experiment and to the fact that measurements by infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) show the presence of both on-top and bridge CO for this system
[24]
, we cannot assign with certainty the binding energy of 286.4 eV to CO on-top Pt(100). Quite likely, the on-top and bridge components are located above and below the central value of 286.4 eV, as is the case for Pt(111)
[22]
. This would imply that the presence of the rhodium substrate shifts the C 1s level towards lower binding energy.

Fig. 3. C 1s spectra for increasing amounts of platinum on Rh(100) saturated with CO. 50 L CO is dosed at RT except in the case of the clean Rh(100) (bottom), where 100 L is dosed at 0C yielding the c(6×2) structure. Platinum coverages are as indicated. The photon energy is 380 eV.
To further elucidate the effect of the platinumrhodium interaction, we now look at CO sticking on the bimetallic surfaces.
Fig. 4
shows CO coverage as a function of CO exposure for several platinum coverages on Rh(100). CO was dosed at RT except in the case of 100 L on Rh(100) (
final point, upper curve
) where the temperature was 0C. The CO coverage has been estimated from photoemission intensities of C 1s and CO valence levels (4σ+5σ/1π), and normalized to 0.83 for the c(6×2) CO/Rh(100) overlayer. We find that this method gives coverages in the correct intervals for the all of the overlayer structures for CO/Rh(100). The agreement between the coverage estimated from C 1s and from the valence levels is always good.
Fig. 4
clearly shows decreasing sticking and saturation coverage for increasing platinum coverages. On the 0.9 ML Pt/Rh(100) surface the saturation coverage is 0.27 ML, less than half of the CO/Rh(100) saturation coverage. The saturation coverage for CO/Pt(100) is 0.75 ML
[24]
. Since the quasi-hexagonal reconstruction of Pt(100) is lifted upon CO adsorption (see, e.g.,
[24]
and references therein), CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100) should be directly comparable to adsorption on Pt(100). Clearly, the saturation coverage on the former is lower than on the latter. It has been shown previously that the interaction with other metals may weaken the COPt bond, lowering the CO desorption temperature
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[22]
,
[25]
. The CO saturation coverage at RT is thus significantly reduced. COmetal bond weakening is generally observed for group 10 metals in contact with other metals
[1]
. This may be explained by depopulation and a shift towards higher binding energy of the group 10 metal d-states, which reduces the 2π backdonation and thereby the bond strength
[1]
. As shown in
Section 3.1
, we observe a shift of the Pt 4f level towards higher binding energy for platinum in contact with rhodium. If this core-level shift is not dominated by final-state effects, it reflects a shift towards higher binding energy of the platinum d-band center (local density of states). We therefore believe that the contact with the rhodium substrate is responsible for the reduced CO sticking on the platinum overlayer through a ligand effect. This finding is in agreement with general trends reported in the literature
[1]
. A reduction of the COmetal bond strength was also recently observed for CO adsorption on Pd/Rh(111)
[26]
. In the latter case it was found that the perturbations in the electronic and chemical properties of the palladium admetal were weaker than in the Cu/Rh(100)
[5]
,
[6]
, Fe/Rh(100)
[7]
and Zn/Rh(111)
[27]
systems, possibly due to both palladium and rhodium being elements with almost full valence bands

Fig. 4. CO sticking on Pt/Rh(100) surfaces. The CO coverage, as estimated from photoemission intensities (see text), as a function of CO exposure is shown for various platinum coverages (as indicated) on Rh(100).
Turning now to the effect of surface platinum on the CO adsorption on rhodium sites, we look more closely at the C 1s spectra for CO/0.2 ML Pt/Rh(100).
Fig. 5
shows such spectra for three different CO doses. Recalling the assignments of the different components of this spectrum given in the discussion of
Fig. 3
, the low-binding-energy component is CO in rhodium bridge sites, the middle component is CO on-top rhodium and the deepest laying component is CO in platinum bridge sites. In the
upper spectrum
(50 L CO) we have also included a fourth and very weak component at even higher binding energy representing CO in platinum on-top sites. We see that the two CO-on-Rh components dominate the spectrum, which is to be expected when only 0.2 ML of platinum has been deposited. More interestingly, we observe that the rhodium bridge component dominates for all the CO doses. This is contrary to what is observed for CO/Rh(100) where the two lowest exposures would result in a c(2×2) structure containing predominantly on-top sites, as seen in the
bottom spectrum in Fig. 5
[9]
. The CO coverages obtained after these exposures (shown on the
left in the figure
) are not very different from those obtained for the same exposures on Rh(100), see
Fig. 4
. Estimating the CO density on the rhodium patches of the surface from the relative intensities of the C 1s components (for all the platinum overlayers), we find that CO adsorbs with a slight preference for rhodium sites. This is in agreement with results on CO/Pt0.25Rh0.75(111)
[28]
. Taking this into account we find that the CO density on the rhodium patches after 1.5 L is on the border of that required to form the
phase. However, LEED displays a c(2×2) pattern in this case. In fact, the c(2×2) pattern is seen also after 50 L exposure, where we should clearly be in the
domain. We thus observe two changes in the adsorption properties of the system caused by the presence of platinum: the c(2×2) structure is observed for higher CO densities, where the
structure would be expected, and there has been a site switch from predominantly on-top to predominantly bridge in the c(2×2) structure. The appearance of small amounts of bridge CO has previously been reported for CO/Rh(100) if the surface contains impurities
[29]
. Exposure to hydrogen is also reported to cause a switch from on-top to bridge sites and a compression of the c(2×2) overlayer into the
structure for CO/Rh(100)
[30]
, however only if CO is dosed first. When CO is dosed on a hydrogen-saturated surface, all CO molecules occupy on-top sites
[30]
. These observations indicate that the CO overlayer is very sensitive to co-adsorbates. We also note that in our case the site switch cannot be caused by hydrogen contamination because the measuring time is too short to provide more than a maximum of 5% hydrogen on the surface. If hydrogen contamination occurred during platinum deposition, it would cause the CO molecules to occupy on-top sites only. For CO/0.2 ML Pt/Rh(100) we find approximately 70% of the CO molecules on rhodium to be in bridge sites. If platinum atoms only affect CO molecules adsorbed on nearest-neighbor rhodium atoms, this would require the platinum to be dispersed as single atoms or as dimers on the surface. More likely, and in agreement with our interpretation of the Pt 4f components (see
Fig. 1
), platinum grows as somewhat larger islands. The observed site switch therefore requires longer-range interactions in the CO overlayer in addition to a low energy barrier between on-top and bridge adsorption sites. For higher platinum coverages the increased intensity of the CO-on-Pt components in the C 1s spectrum, with uncertain widths and energy positions, complicates the assignment of relative weight to the on-top and bridge CO-on-Rh components (see
Fig. 3
).

Fig. 5. C 1s spectra for CO/0.2 ML Pt/Rh(100) after CO exposures of 0.5 L, 1.5 L and 50 L, as indicated on the right. Shown on the left is the resulting CO coverage. The bottom spectrum is from a c(2×2) CO overlayer on Rh(100), shown for comparison. The spectra are not scaled with their proper intensity. The photon energy is 380 eV.
We would now like to determine the site distribution for CO on the platinum islands.
Fig. 5
shows that the C 1s spectra for CO/0.2 ML Pt/Rh(100) may be fit by using just one CO-on-Pt component, namely the bridge component (in the 50 L spectrum we have included 1% Pt-on-top). For 0.9 ML of platinum
Fig. 3
shows approximately a 1:1 ratio between on-top and bridge CO-on-Pt after 50 L CO exposure. For lower exposures (not shown) we find similar distributions, possibly with a slight preference for the on-top site. The preference for the bridge site on 0.2 ML of platinum is confirmed by analysis of the corresponding Pt 4f7/2 spectra (not shown). Such spectra are shown for CO on 0.9 ML of platinum in
Fig. 6
. The bottom spectrum is recorded prior to CO exposure and contains three platinum components as discussed above, in
Section 3.1
. After CO is dosed, a new component has appeared at approximately 71.65 eV (varying slightly with the CO coverage). It is also noted that the component already present at 71.25 eV grows with increasing CO exposures. We attribute these components to platinum in contact with CO molecules. It is reasonable to assume that the lowest coordinated CO molecules (i.e., in on-top sites) would cause the largest perturbations on the neighboring platinum atom(s) and thus cause the largest core-level shift. This is in accord with previous observations for CO/Pt(111) where bridge and on-top coordinated CO gave Pt 4f7/2 binding energies of 71.23 eV and 71.91 eV, respectively
[31]
. We thus assign the 71.25 eV and 71.65 eV components to platinum atoms coordinated by CO molecules in bridge and on-top sites, respectively. The presence of a component at 71.25 eV prior to CO exposure might mean that the surface was contaminated by a small amount of bridge CO. However, we find no correlation between the intensity of this component and the amount of CO present as judged from valence-band spectroscopy. This amount is also always much smaller (see the
Experimental section
). We therefore believe that there are two separate states overlapping around this binding energy. Using this information,
Fig. 6
shows that CO adsorbed on 0.9 ML of platinum is evenly distributed between on-top and bridge sites, confirming our observations based on C 1s spectra (see
Fig. 3
). In the case of CO adsorption on 0.5 ML Pt/Rh(100) it is difficult to determine the site distribution from the C 1s spectra. This is because the CO-on-Pt and CO-on-Rh components have similar intensities (see
Fig. 3
). It is found that the relative intensities are very sensitive to the spectral width and energy position of each component. Since these cannot be determined exactly, we look instead to the Pt 4f7/2 spectra in
Fig. 7
to establish the CO site distribution. From this figure it is immediately clear that the on-top component (highest binding energy) dominates. In the decomposition of these spectra we have used a considerably larger Gaussian broadening for the CO on-top component than for the others. This procedure led to an excellent agreement between the site distributions estimated from the C 1s and Pt 4f7/2 spectra in the case of the 0.9 ML film. As mentioned, such a comparison cannot easily be made for the 0.5 ML film. However, all attempts with different spectral widths for the components in
Fig. 7
led to a dominance of the on-top component.

In summary, it has been found that CO adsorbing on platinum islands on Rh(100) changes preferences for adsorption site as a function of platinum coverage. On a 0.2 ML film the bridge site is preferred, on the 0.5 ML film the on-top site is preferred, and for the 0.9 ML film an even distribution between bridge and on-top adsorption is found. These distributions are found to be relatively insensitive to the CO dose. For CO/Pt(100) a c(2×2) overlayer is observed, saturating at 0.5 ML, which is argued to consist of two domains, one containing exclusively on-top and the other exclusively bridge CO
[24]
,
[32]
. The distribution between these domains is found to vary with temperature. For CO/Pt/Rh(100) we always observe a c(2×2) LEED pattern with background intensity increasing with the platinum coverage, indicating a somewhat disordered CO overlayer on the platinum islands. From photoemission intensities we estimate that the CO concentration on the platinum islands never exceeds 50% coverage. It is thus possible that, although somewhat disordered, the CO overlayer on the platinum islands consists of c(2×2) domains whose adsorption site preference changes with the platinum coverage. The coexistence of the two c(2×2) phases on Pt(100) shows that they must be energetically similar. We therefore believe that even very small structural changes in the platinum layer could be enough to change the balance between on-top and bridge adsorption.
3.3. Valence-band photoemission
Fig. 8
shows valence-band photoelectron spectra for CO/Pt/Rh(100) (see caption for details). The
bottom spectrum
is from a c(6×2) CO overlayer on Rh(100), clearly showing the 4σ peak and the 5σ/1π joint feature, at approximately 10.6 and 7.6 eV binding energy, respectively. As the platinum coverage is increased, the two features are seen to shift towards higher binding energy. For a 0.9 ML film saturated with CO (50 L) they are found at 11.5 and 8.7 eV, both peaks shifted by 1 eV. In comparison, the 4σ, 5σ and 1π peaks are observed at 11.65, 9.25 and 8.40 eV, respectively, for CO/Pt(111)
[22]
. The energy positions of the CO molecular orbitals are thus seen to approach those of CO on platinum as the platinum coverage is increased. It is interesting to note that the two spectral features shift by similar amounts. Furthermore, the CO 3σ level, shown in
Fig. 9
, also displays a 1 eV shift, from 27.7 eV for CO/Rh(100) to 28.8 eV for CO/0.9 ML Pt/Rh(100). Recalling our conclusions in conjunction with
Fig. 3
, the C 1s level was found to shift 0.55 eV towards higher binding energy between these surfaces. We have thus observed three valence levels and one shallow core level (3σ), which all shift by approximately the same amount, in addition to one deeper core level (C 1s) that shifts in the same direction, but by a somewhat smaller amount. These states are very different in their position, degree of localization and in their participation in the COmetal bond. We therefore suggest that the shifts observed may be explained mainly by electrostatic effects. The effective potential that constitutes the solidsurface barrier acts as an external field on the adsorbing CO molecule. Its effect on the adsorbate levels may be estimated by first-order perturbation theory. The result is
where Δεa is the adsorbate level shift, ψa is the corresponding adsorbate wave function, veff(z) is the effective potential as a function of the distance, z, from the surface and za is the equilibrium position of the adsorbate
[33]
. Assuming that the COmetal bond distance, za, is approximately the same on the platinum islands and the rhodium substrate, we find that the binding energy shift between platinum and rhodium sites equals the difference in the effective potential at platinum and rhodium sites. This should, in turn, scale roughly with the difference in inner potential between the two metals. Platinum has a much deeper valence band than rhodium. Thus, the effect of the surface barrier would be to increase the binding energy of the CO levels for CO on platinum with respect to CO on rhodium, as is observed.

4. Conclusions
CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100) surfaces has been studied by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy. Platinum, in the submonolayer regime, was found to grow as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100). CO adsorption on the Pt/Rh(100) surface was found to be significantly different to that of CO on Pt(100) and CO on Rh(100). The CO saturation coverage on a platinum monolayer on Rh(100) is strongly reduced compared with that on Pt(100). We explain this in terms of a reduced COPt bond strength in the presence of the Rh(100) substrate. This finding agrees with the general trends reported for CO adsorption on group 10 metals in bimetallic systems. Moreover, the preferential CO adsorption site on platinum is seen to vary with platinum coverage. On a 0.2 ML platinum film the bridge site is preferred, on 0.5 ML platinum the on-top site is preferred, and for the 0.9 ML platinum film an even distribution between bridge and on-top adsorption is found. A site switch for CO from on-top to bridge sites in the c(2×2) CO overlayer on Rh(100) has been observed in the presence of 0.2 ML of platinum.
