This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, their synthesis, characterization, or related studies. The document appears to be a citation for a different paper about transition-metal films on tungsten (211), which is unrelated to the question asked.
