[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

[2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

[3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several key steps:

1. Deposition process: Ni is deposited onto a Pt(111) substrate maintained at 600 K to ensure uniform coverage.

2. Coverage estimation: The Ni overlayer coverage is determined by measuring the reduction in the Pt Auger peak intensity at 237 eV.

3. Structural analysis: Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) is used to confirm the epitaxial growth and surface structure of the Ni layer on Pt(111).

4. Thickness variation: Different thicknesses of Ni films are prepared, ranging from monolayer coverage to thick films where the Pt Auger signal is no longer detectable.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed information about the surface composition, structure, and growth mode. This information is essential for accurately modeling the surface in computational studies and for interpreting experimental results in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The well-defined nature of these surfaces allows for a systematic study of how the interplay between Ni and Pt affects catalytic properties, which is vital for designing more efficient catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下几个关键步骤进行：

1. 沉积过程：在保持600 K温度的Pt(111)衬底上沉积Ni，以确保均匀覆盖。

2. 覆盖率估计：通过测量Pt俄歇峰（237 eV）强度的减弱来确定Ni覆盖层的覆盖率。

3. 结构分析：使用低能电子衍射（LEED）来确认Ni层在Pt(111)上的外延生长和表面结构。

4. 厚度变化：制备不同厚度的Ni薄膜，从单层覆盖到厚膜（此时Pt俄歇信号不再可检测）。

这种表征过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了关于表面成分、结构和生长模式的详细信息。这些信息对于在计算研究中准确建模表面以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中解释实验结果是必不可少的。这些表面的精确定义性质使得系统研究Ni和Pt之间的相互作用如何影响催化性能成为可能，这对设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。
