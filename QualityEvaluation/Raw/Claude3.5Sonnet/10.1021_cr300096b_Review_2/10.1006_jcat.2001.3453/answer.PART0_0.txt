[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

[2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

[3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several techniques:

1. Deposition process: Ni is deposited on a Pt(111) substrate maintained at 600 K to ensure uniform coverage.

2. Coverage estimation: The Ni overlayer coverage is estimated by measuring the reduction in the Pt(237 eV) Auger peak after Ni deposition.

3. Structural analysis: Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) is used to confirm the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111), revealing a sharp (111) pattern.

4. Thickness determination: For thick Ni films, deposition continues until the Pt Auger signal is no longer detectable.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and growth mode. This information is essential for accurately modeling the surface in theoretical studies and for interpreting experimental results in catalysis research. The well-defined structure allows researchers to correlate the observed catalytic properties with specific surface arrangements, enabling a deeper understanding of structure-function relationships in bimetallic catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下几种技术进行：

1. 沉积过程：在600 K的温度下将Ni沉积在Pt(111)基底上，以确保均匀覆盖。

2. 覆盖度估算：通过测量Ni沉积后Pt(237 eV)俄歇峰的减少来估算Ni覆盖层的覆盖度。

3. 结构分析：使用低能电子衍射(LEED)来确认Ni在Pt(111)上的外延生长，显示出清晰的(111)衍射图案。

4. 厚度测定：对于厚Ni膜，继续沉积直到Pt的俄歇信号不再可检测。

这个表征过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论(DFT)计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了关于表面结构、组成和生长模式的详细信息。这些信息对于在理论研究中准确建模表面以及在催化研究中解释实验结果是必不可少的。明确定义的结构允许研究人员将观察到的催化性质与特定的表面排列相关联，从而深入理解双金属催化剂中的结构-功能关系。
