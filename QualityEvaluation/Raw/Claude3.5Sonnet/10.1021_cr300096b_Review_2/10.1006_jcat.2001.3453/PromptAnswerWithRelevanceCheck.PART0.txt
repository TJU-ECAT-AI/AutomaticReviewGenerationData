[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

[2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

[3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several techniques:

1. Deposition process: Ni is deposited on a Pt(111) substrate maintained at 600 K to ensure uniform coverage.

2. Coverage estimation: The Ni overlayer coverage is estimated by measuring the reduction in the Pt(237 eV) Auger peak after Ni deposition.

3. Structural analysis: Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) is used to confirm the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111), revealing a sharp (111) pattern.

4. Thickness determination: For thick Ni films, deposition continues until the Pt Auger signal is no longer detectable.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and growth mode. This information is essential for accurately modeling the surface in theoretical studies and for interpreting experimental results in catalysis research. The well-defined structure allows researchers to correlate the observed catalytic properties with specific surface arrangements, enabling a deeper understanding of structure-function relationships in bimetallic catalysts.
