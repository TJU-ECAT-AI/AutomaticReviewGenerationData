[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

[2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

[3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several methods:

1. Temperature control: The Pt(111) substrate is maintained at 600 K during Ni deposition to ensure uniform coverage.

2. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): The coverage of the Ni overlayer is estimated by measuring the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after Ni deposition.

3. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED): Used to confirm the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111), revealing a sharp (111) pattern.

4. Thickness determination: For thick Ni films, deposition continues until the Pt Auger signal is within the noise level.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and uniformity. This information is essential for accurately modeling the system, performing DFT calculations, and interpreting experimental results in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The well-characterized surfaces ensure that the observed chemical properties and catalytic behaviors can be directly linked to the known surface structure, enabling researchers to develop structure-property relationships and design more effective catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下几种方法进行：

1. 温度控制：在沉积Ni时，将Pt(111)基底保持在600 K，以确保均匀覆盖。

2. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：通过测量Ni沉积后Pt(237 eV)峰的减少来估计Ni覆盖层的覆盖度。

3. 低能电子衍射（LEED）：用于确认Ni在Pt(111)上的外延生长，显示出清晰的(111)衍射图案。

4. 厚度测定：对于厚Ni膜，继续沉积直到Pt的俄歇信号处于噪声水平。

这个表征过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了关于表面结构、成分和均匀性的详细信息。这些信息对于准确模拟系统、进行DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下解释实验结果是必不可少的。经过充分表征的表面确保观察到的化学性质和催化行为可以直接与已知的表面结构联系起来，使研究人员能够建立结构-性能关系并设计更有效的催化剂。
