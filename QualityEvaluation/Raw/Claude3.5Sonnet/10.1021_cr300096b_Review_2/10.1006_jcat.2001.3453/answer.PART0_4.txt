[1] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12). Briefly, the substrate was maintained at 600 K during deposition, and the Ni deposition remained uniform across the substrate surface."

[2] "The coverage of the Ni overlayer was estimated based on the reduction of the Pt(237 eV) peak after the deposition of Ni (12)."

[3] "Thick Ni films were generated by exposure to Ni until the Pt Auger signal was within the noise level. LEED measurements revealed a sharp (111) pattern, confirming the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111) at 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several techniques:

1. Temperature control: The Pt(111) substrate is maintained at 600 K during Ni deposition to ensure uniform coverage.

2. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): The coverage of the Ni overlayer is estimated by measuring the reduction in the Pt(237 eV) peak intensity after Ni deposition.

3. Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED): Used to confirm the epitaxial growth of Ni on Pt(111), revealing a sharp (111) pattern.

4. Thickness control: For thick Ni films, deposition continues until the Pt Auger signal is no longer detectable.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it provides detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and growth mode. This information is essential for accurately modeling the surface in computational studies and for interpreting experimental results in the context of surface science and catalysis research. The well-defined structure allows researchers to establish clear structure-property relationships, which are fundamental to advancing our understanding of catalytic processes and designing more efficient catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过以下几种技术进行：

1. 温度控制：在Ni沉积过程中，将Pt(111)衬底保持在600 K，以确保均匀覆盖。

2. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：通过测量Ni沉积后Pt(237 eV)峰强度的减少来估计Ni覆盖层的覆盖度。

3. 低能电子衍射（LEED）：用于确认Ni在Pt(111)上的外延生长，显示出清晰的(111)衍射图案。

4. 厚度控制：对于厚Ni膜，持续沉积直到Pt俄歇信号不再可检测。

这个表征过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了关于表面结构、组成和生长模式的详细信息。这些信息对于在计算研究中准确建模表面以及在表面科学和催化研究背景下解释实验结果是必不可少的。明确定义的结构使研究人员能够建立清晰的结构-性能关系，这对于推进我们对催化过程的理解和设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。
