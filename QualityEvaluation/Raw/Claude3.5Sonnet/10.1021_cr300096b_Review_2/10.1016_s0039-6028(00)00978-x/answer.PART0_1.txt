This question cannot be directly answered based on the given literature. The document focuses on studying Pt thin films deposited on Ni(100) surfaces, rather than Ni monolayers on Pt substrates. The literature does not discuss the specific characterization methods for Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt. The document also does not mention structural modeling or DFT calculations for such systems.

However, the literature does describe related characterization techniques that could potentially be applied to Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, such as XPS, LEED, UPS, and TPD. These methods were used to study the growth mode, electronic structure, and chemical reactivity of Pt films on Ni(100). Similar approaches could likely be adapted to characterize Ni/Pt surfaces, though the specific details would differ.

The importance of such characterization for understanding electronic and chemical properties is implied throughout the paper, as it demonstrates how the interface between Pt and Ni affects the electronic structure and reactivity of the surface. This understanding is crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps explain how bimetallic surfaces can have properties distinct from their individual components.

根据给定的文献无法直接回答这个问题。该文档主要研究沉积在Ni(100)表面上的Pt薄膜,而不是沉积在Pt基底上的Ni单层。文献没有讨论通过在Pt(111)或多晶Pt上沉积Ni来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的具体表征方法。文档也没有提到此类系统的结构建模或DFT计算。

然而,文献确实描述了一些相关的表征技术,这些技术可能适用于Ni/Pt双金属表面,如XPS、LEED、UPS和TPD。这些方法被用来研究Pt薄膜在Ni(100)上的生长模式、电子结构和化学反应活性。类似的方法可能会被调整用于表征Ni/Pt表面,尽管具体细节会有所不同。

整篇论文都暗示了这种表征对理解电子和化学性质的重要性,因为它展示了Pt和Ni之间的界面如何影响表面的电子结构和反应活性。这种理解对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要,因为它有助于解释双金属表面如何具有区别于其各个组成部分的特性。
