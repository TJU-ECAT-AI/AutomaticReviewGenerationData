Abstract 
Ni atoms deposited on Pt(110)-(1 × 1) and (1 × 2) surfaces are studied and compared at 130 K. The Auger uptake curve 
of Ni on the Pt(1 I0)-(1 × 1) surface shows an exponential-type growth. The intensifies of all (1 × 1) LEED spots decrease 
gradually and exhibit no oscillation during the deposition. These results demonstrate that this growth follows the 
Volmer-Weber mode. On the other hand, the Auger uptake curve of Ni on the Pt(ll0)-(l ×2) surface shows a 
premonolayer break with an initial linear growth. The LEED pattem changes from (1 × 2) to a pseudo-(1 x 1) after Ni atoms 
fill the sites of the missing rows. After that, the Auger uptake curve turns to an exponential-type and the LEED spot patterns 
all diminish gradually when more Ni atoms are deposited on the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface. These results demonstrate that the 
growth of Ni on the Pt(1 I0)-(1 × 2) surface follows the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) mode. The growth mechanism is discussed 
by considering the lattice mismatch, diffusion, and the surface free energies of the adsorbate and the substrate. 
1. Introduction 
It is generally agreed that the equilibrium struc- 
ture of the clean Pt(110) surface is a missing-row 
(1 × 2) structure [1-4]. In this (1 X 2) surface recon- 
struction, every other close-packed row along the 
[10] direction is absent. The bulk-like (1 X 1) unre- 
constructed surface can be prepared only as a 
metastable state. It can only exist below room tem- 
perature and switches into a stable (1 x 2) state by 
thermal activation [5,6]. 
The study of the growth mechanism of a metal 
thin film is one of the most interesting topics in 
surface science. It is not only of fundamental impor- 
tance as the connection with basic principles, but

also has industrial application. Usually thin film 
growth can be classified into one of three main 
distinct growth modes [7,8]: (1) Frank and van der

monolayer-by-monolayer 
growth; (2) Volmer and Weber (VW) mode - 3D 
island growth; (3) Stranski and Krastanov (SK) mode 
- 
layer growth up to one or a few monolayers 
followed by 3D island growth. 
The primary motivation for the present investiga- 
tion is to compare the growth mechanism on recon- 
structed and unreconstructed surfaces. The phase 
transitions between the (1 × 1) and (1 × 2) of the 
Pt(110) were explored. Low energy electron diffrac- 
tion (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) 
were used to study the growth modes of a Ni ultra- 
thin film grown on Pt(110)-(1 × 1) and (1 × 2) sur- 
faces at 130 K. Also, we discussed the possible 
growth mechanism of these two different systems.

2. Experiment 
Experiments were conducted in a stainless-steel 
ultrahigh vacuum chamber. The UHV pumping sys- 
tem kept the working background pressure better 
than 3 × 10- l0 Torr. The pressure was measured by 
an ion gauge and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. 
The sample preparation and cleaning procedures 
were described elsewhere [9]. The stable recon- 
structed (1 × 2) surface was prepared by standard Ar 
ion bombardment and annealing cycles. The unre- 
constructed, bulk-like (1 × 1) surface can be pre- 
pared from a clean and well-ordered (1 × 2) surface 
by adsorption of CO at a pressure of 2 × 10 -7 Torr 
and at temperature 430 K [10,11]. The sample was 
cooled slowly to 270 K until it was saturated with 
CO. Then the sample was irradiated with 600 eV 
electrons for a few minutes at T < 240 K to remove 
adsorbed CO. Finally hydrogen was introduced at 
1 X 10 -7 Ton" about 3 min to remove all residual 
carbon or oxygen. The cleanness of the surface was 
checked by AES. The electron energy analyzer for 
AES was the CLAM2 hemispherical analyzer of VG 
MICRO TECH. The phase transition between (1 × 1) 
and (1 × 2) was observed by a four-grid video-LEED. 
The Ni deposition source was a sharp point bent 
from 1 mm diameter wire. Liquid nitrogen was used 
to cool the sample continuously and control the 
temperature at 130 K in the deposition process. The 
temperature was read by a K-type thermocouple.

3. Results and discussion 
The LEED patterns of the (1 × 2) reconstructed 
and (1 × 1) unreconstructed surfaces were shown in 
Fig. 1. All patterns were recorded at normal inci- 
dence with incident electron energy 135 eV. The 
video-LEED was used to study the behavior of the 
phase transition from phase (1 × 1) to phase (1 × 2). 
The temperature was increased from room tempera- 
ture at a rate of 15 K/min in order to trigger the 
phase transition. We monitored the peak intensity of 
the (0, 1/2) beam as a function of temperature. The 
result is shown in Fig. 2. The half beam started to 
grow at T = 320 K. This result is consistent with the 
report studied by field ion microscopy (FIM) [12]. 
The development of the half beam was complete at

425 K. The LEED intensity decreased as the temper- 
ature exceeded 425 K, which is in accordance with 
the Debye-Waller effect. Since the transition tem- 
perature is low, the comparative study in the growth 
mode of Ni on Pt(ll0)-(1 × 2) and (1 × 1) at low 
temperature is suitable.

The Ni overlayer growth was monitored by the 
relative evolutions of Ni 848 eV and Pt 237 eV AES 
signals. The Ni Auger peak-to-peak height versus 
deposition time of Ni on Pt(110)-(1 x 1) and (1 x 2) 
are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, both the Auger 
uptake curve of Ni and the coverage curve of Pt vary 
almost exponentially during the whole deposited pro- 
cess on the (1 x 1) surface. This phenomenon sug- 
gests that there is 3D island growth when Ni atoms 
deposited on the Pt(ll0)-(1 X 1) unreconstructed 
surface. We checked a few times and found that the 
Ni signal is always abnormally high in the begin- 
ning. We believe that because of the special prepar- 
ing process, the Pt(ll0)-(1 X 1) surface has many 
steps. Ni atoms can stick at these steps easily as soon 
as they are deposited on the surface. So the initial 
sticking coefficient of Ni on the Pt(lll)-(1 X 1) 
surface is specially high. The Auger uptake curve for 
deposition on the (1 X 2) surface presents a different 
fashion: we found that the Auger intensity of Ni 
increases linearly with a break at 250 s as shown in 
Fig. 3b. Apparently, Ni atoms deposited on the 
(1 X 2) reconstruction surface follows another growth 
mode. The change of the slope on the Auger uptake 
curve is interpreted as a complete layer on a flat 
surface. Based on the structure of the Pt(110)-(1 X 2) 
missing-row surface, we believe that the break at 250

linear variation is found in the whole deposited process. This 
suggests that the 3D island growth is possible. (b) The Auger

s is an indication of the complete filling of the 
missing-row sites with evaporated Ni atoms. The 
corresponding coverage of Ni is 1/2 monolayer 
(ML) at this time. The Auger uptake curves change 
to exponential curves after t = 500 s. These experi- 
mental results show that the growth of Ni on the 
Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface changes to 3D island growth 
after growing one monolayer of Ni. 
LEED intensity can also be used to monitor the 
thin film growth on a metal substrate [13]. The peak

profiles 
of Ni/Pt(110)-(1X 
l) and (l ×2). The 
peak intensity 
of the (1, - 2) beam of the (1X 1) diminish 
gradu- 
ally. The intensity 
of the (1, -2) beam of the (1X2) increases 
and reaches a maximum at 250 s, while the intensity of the 
(1, -3/2) beam decreases 
very 
fast to the background. 
tensities of the (1, -2), (1, -3/2) 
beams versus 
deposition time in the Ni/Pt(110)-(1 × 2) system are 
shown in Fig. 4. The energy of normal incident 
electrons was 135 eV which is close to the out-of- 
phase condition [14]. With Ni coverage increasing, 
the intensity of the (1, -2) beam of the (1 × 1) 
LEED pattern has no oscillation at all but decreases 
monotonously and becomes close to the background 
gradually. We found that all diffracted spots have the 
same properties as that of the (1, -2) beam. This 
suggests that the deposited Ni atoms on the Pt(110)- 
(1 × l) surface are in a disordered state. On the other 
hand, the diffracted spots of the (1 × 2) LEED pat- 
tern have significant distinction: the LEED peak 
intensities of the integer beams increase and reach a 
maximum at 250 s. At the same time, the intensities 
of the half beams decrease to the background. It 
looks like that the pattern changes from (1 × 2) to 
(1 × l) at 250 s. This pattern can be called the 
pseudo-(1 × 1) structure [14]. This pseudo-(1 × 1) 
structure consists of two sublattices that are the Pt 
sublattice and the Ni sublattice. Each sublattice has a 
(1 × 2) structure. For the half-order beams, the two 
sublattices have an antiphase relationship in the out- 
of-phase diffraction condition. The pseudo-(1 × 1) 
structure corresponding to a coverage of 1/2 ML of 
Ni is consistent with the result of Auger uptake 
curve in Fig. 3b. 
Combining the results of AES and LEED, we 
found that Ni/Pt(ll0)-(1 × 1) forms a 3D island 
growth, i.e. the VW growth mode, but Ni/Pt(110)- 
(1 × 2) exhibits layer growth followed by agglomer- 
ation into 3D islands, i.e. the SK growth mode. The 
different growth behaviors result primarily from the 
different surface structures. The mechanism of epi- 
taxial growth can be considered from two different 
approaches. From the thermodynamics viewpoint, 
AT= TN- Tn + Tint, where T is the surface free 
energy and Tint is the interface energy. When A 
T 
0, the layer-by-layer growth is favored [15]. When 
AT> 0, the 3D island growth is favored. Since 
TNi = 2.364 and TPt = 2.691 J m -2 [16], the layer- 
by-layer growth is favored if we neglect Tnt for the 
Ni/Pt(ll0) system. Direct imaging of the CO-in- 
duced (1 × 1) surface by means of scanning tunnel- 
ing microscopy (STM) revealed that the topmost 
layer is full of random steps between small domains 
of the (1 × 1) terraces [17]. Apparently, Tint of the 
stable (1 x 2) surface is smaller than that of the 
metastable (1 × 1) surface. So the layer-by-layer 
growth on the (1 × 1) surface is less favored than 
that of the (1 × 2) surface. Another viewpoint is 
based on the lattice mismatch [18,19]. If the lattice 
mismatch is larger than 2%, the 3D island growth is 
expected because of misfit strain. The lattice mis- 
match in the Ni/Pt system is 10%. 3D island growth 
is favored. But Ni atoms easily sit on the missing-row 
sites of the (1 × 2) reconstructed surface, so the 
misfit strain is less important. Therefore, when Ni 
atoms are deposited on the (1 × 1) surface at low 
temperature, the slow diffusion of Ni atoms plus the 
metastable surface of the substrate will not cause the 
ordered layer growth to be formed. On the other 
hand, the competition of the surface free energy and 
the lattice mismatch of Ni/Pt(110)-(1 × 2) cause the 
SK growth mode: the growth changes to the forma- 
tion of 3D island after Ni atoms fill the sites of 
missing rows and accumulate to one monolayer. 
4. Conclusion 
The phase transition from (1 X 1) to (1 × 2) of the 
Pt(ll0) surface was observed before the study in 
growth 
modes 
of 
Ni/Pt(ll0)-(1 × l) 
and

Ni/Pt(110)-(1 × 2) were carried out by LEED and 
AES at a temperature of 130 K. From the results of 
Auger uptake curves and the intensity profiles of 
LEED spots, we conclude that the growth of Ni on 
the Pt(ll0)-(1 × 1) surface follows the VW mode, 
while the Pt(ll0)-(1 × 2) surface follows the SK 
mode. The metastable state of the substrate and slow 
diffusion of Ni atoms on the Pt(ll0)-(1 × 1) surface 
at low temperature may be the main reason in devel- 
oping the 3D island growth. On the other hand, the 
missing-row structure, the competition of the surface 
free energy and the lattice mismatch of Ni on the 
Pt(11O)-(1 × 2) surface may cause the layer-by-layer 
growth up to 1 ML, before the surface changes to a 
3D island growth.
