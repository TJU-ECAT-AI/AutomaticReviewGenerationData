          "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

"Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

"A previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) and density functional theory study (DFT) showed that most of the Ni in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface does not remain on the surface when the Pt(1 1 1) crystal temperature is 600 K"

"The Pt/Ni AES ratio begins to decrease at approximately 600 K and most of the Pt has diffused into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) by temperatures around 1000 K."

"Previous LEED studies indicate that a thick Pt film does not form an ordered (1 1 1) layer on Ni(1 1 1), possibly due to the lattice mismatch between the two metals"

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using multiple complementary techniques:

1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) is used to analyze surface composition and estimate Pt coverage. For example, a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8 corresponds to approximately one monolayer of Pt.

2. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) provides atomic-scale imaging of the surface structure.

3. Low-Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (LEIS) helps determine the composition of the outermost atomic layer.

4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are employed to model the surface structure and energetics.

5. Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) provides information on surface structure and ordering.

6. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) is used to study reaction pathways and surface reactivity.

7. High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) provides information on surface-adsorbate bonding and molecular orientations.

These characterization methods are crucial because they provide detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for:

1. Developing accurate structural models of the bimetallic surfaces.
2. Performing realistic DFT calculations that can predict surface properties and reactivity.
3. Understanding how the combination of Ni and Pt affects the electronic structure and chemical properties of the surface.
4. Studying thermal stability and diffusion processes, such as Pt diffusion into the Ni bulk at higher temperatures.
5. Investigating surface ordering and the effects of lattice mismatch between the two metals.

By combining these experimental and theoretical approaches, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is vital for advancing surface science and developing improved catalysts for various applications.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过多种互补技术进行的：

1. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)用于分析表面成分和估算Pt覆盖率。例如，Pt/Ni AES比率为0.8对应约一个单层的Pt。

2. 扫描隧道显微镜(STM)提供表面结构的原子尺度成像。

3. 低能离子散射谱(LEIS)有助于确定最外层原子层的组成。

4. 密度泛函理论(DFT)计算用于模拟表面结构和能量学。

5. 低能电子衍射(LEED)提供表面结构和有序性的信息。

6. 程序升温脱附(TPD)用于研究反应途径和表面反应活性。

7. 高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS)提供表面-吸附物键合和分子取向的信息。

这些表征方法至关重要，因为它们提供了有关双金属表面结构、成分和电子性质的详细信息。这些信息对以下方面至关重要：

1. 开发双金属表面的精确结构模型。
2. 进行可以预测表面性质和反应活性的实际DFT计算。
3. 理解Ni和Pt的组合如何影响表面的电子结构和化学性质。
4. 研究热稳定性和扩散过程，例如在较高温度下Pt向Ni体相的扩散。
5. 调查表面有序性和两种金属之间晶格失配的影响。

通过结合这些实验和理论方法，研究人员可以全面了解Ni/Pt双金属表面，这对于推进表面科学和开发各种应用的改进催化剂至关重要。
