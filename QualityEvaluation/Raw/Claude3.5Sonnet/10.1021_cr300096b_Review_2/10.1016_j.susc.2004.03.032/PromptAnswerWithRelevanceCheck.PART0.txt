The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is typically conducted using various surface science techniques, though this specific paper focuses on the reverse system (Pt on Ni). For Pt/Ni surfaces, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) was used to characterize the surfaces. The researchers estimated that a monolayer of Pt corresponded to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8. They also studied the thermal stability of the Pt overlayers, finding that Pt begins to diffuse into the Ni bulk at around 600 K, with most Pt diffused by 1000 K.

While not directly addressing Ni/Pt surfaces, this study of the reverse system provides valuable insights into bimetallic surface characterization. Such detailed surface characterization is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations, as it provides essential information about surface composition, coverage, and thermal stability. This information forms the basis for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, which is vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
