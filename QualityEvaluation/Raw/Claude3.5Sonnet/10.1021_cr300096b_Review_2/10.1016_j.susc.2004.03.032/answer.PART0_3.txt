[1] "Our research has previously focused on studying the effect of Ni deposition on Pt(1 1 1). This paper focuses on understanding the properties of the reverse deposition conditions, i.e. depositing Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[2] "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "A detailed STM study would be necessary to rule out any changes in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface morphology that might cause this initial increase in the Pt/Ni AES ratio."

[4] "Previous LEED studies indicate that a thick Pt film does not form an ordered (1 1 1) layer on Ni(1 1 1), possibly due to the lattice mismatch between the two metals"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is typically conducted using a combination of surface science techniques. While this paper focuses on Pt/Ni(111) surfaces, it mentions previous studies on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces and draws comparisons between the two systems. Key characterization methods include:

1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Used to monitor surface composition and estimate coverage.

2. Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED): Provides information on surface structure and ordering.

3. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM): Although not used in this study, it is mentioned as a technique that would be necessary for detailed surface morphology analysis.

4. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): Used to study reaction pathways and surface reactivity.

5. High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): Provides information on surface-adsorbate bonding and molecular orientations.

These characterization techniques are crucial for structural modeling and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces. They provide essential data on surface composition, structure, and reactivity, which can be used to validate and refine theoretical models and DFT calculations. This comprehensive characterization approach enables researchers to establish structure-property relationships and gain insights into the fundamental aspects of catalysis on these complex surfaces.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常使用多种表面科学技术的组合进行。虽然这篇论文主要关注Pt/Ni(111)表面，但它提到了之前对Ni/Pt(111)表面的研究，并在两个系统之间进行了比较。主要的表征方法包括：

1. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)：用于监测表面成分和估算覆盖度。

2. 低能电子衍射(LEED)：提供表面结构和有序性的信息。

3. 扫描隧道显微镜(STM)：虽然本研究中未使用，但被提及为详细分析表面形貌所必需的技术。

4. 程序升温脱附(TPD)：用于研究反应途径和表面反应活性。

5. 高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS)：提供表面-吸附物键合和分子取向的信息。

这些表征技术对于结构建模和理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。它们提供了关于表面组成、结构和反应活性的基本数据，可用于验证和完善理论模型和密度泛函理论(DFT)计算。这种综合表征方法使研究人员能够建立结构-性能关系，并深入了解这些复杂表面上催化作用的基本方面。
