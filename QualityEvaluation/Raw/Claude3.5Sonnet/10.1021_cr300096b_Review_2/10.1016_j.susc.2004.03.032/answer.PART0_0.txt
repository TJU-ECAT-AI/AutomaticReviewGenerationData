[1] "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

[2] "Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

[3] "A previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) and density functional theory study (DFT) showed that most of the Ni in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface does not remain on the surface when the Pt(1 1 1) crystal temperature is 600 K"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using multiple techniques:

1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) is used to analyze surface composition and estimate Pt coverage. 

2. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is employed to study surface morphology at the atomic scale.

3. Low-Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (LEIS) is utilized to determine the elemental composition of the outermost atomic layer.

4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are performed to model the surface structure and energetics.

These characterization methods are crucial because they provide detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for:

1. Developing accurate structural models of the bimetallic surfaces.
2. Performing realistic DFT calculations that can predict surface properties and reactivity.
3. Understanding how the combination of Ni and Pt affects the electronic structure and chemical properties of the surface.
4. Correlating the surface structure and composition with observed catalytic behaviors.

By combining these experimental and theoretical approaches, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is vital for advancing surface science and developing improved catalysts for various applications.
