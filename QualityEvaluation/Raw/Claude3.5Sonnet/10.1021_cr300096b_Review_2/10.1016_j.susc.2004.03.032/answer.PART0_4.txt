[1] "Our research has previously focused on studying the effect of Ni deposition on Pt(1 1 1). This paper focuses on understanding the properties of the reverse deposition conditions, i.e. depositing Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[2] "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

[4] "The Pt/Ni AES ratio begins to decrease at approximately 600 K and most of the Pt has diffused into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) by temperatures around 1000 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is typically conducted using various surface science techniques, though this specific paper focuses on the reverse system (Pt/Ni). For Pt/Ni(111) surfaces, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) was used to characterize the surfaces. The Pt/Ni AES ratio was used to estimate Pt coverage, with a ratio of 0.8 corresponding to approximately one monolayer of Pt. Thermal stability was also studied, showing Pt diffusion into the Ni bulk at higher temperatures.

While not directly discussed for Ni/Pt systems, similar techniques would likely be used. This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding electronic and chemical properties because it provides essential information about surface composition, coverage, and thermal stability. This data forms the foundation for accurately modeling the system, performing relevant calculations, and interpreting experimental results in the context of surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常使用各种表面科学技术进行，虽然这篇特定的论文关注的是相反的系统(Pt/Ni)。对于Pt/Ni(111)表面，使用了俄歇电子能谱(AES)进行表征。Pt/Ni AES比率被用来估计Pt覆盖率，比率为0.8对应约一个单层的Pt。还研究了热稳定性，显示在较高温度下Pt会扩散到Ni体相中。

虽然没有直接讨论Ni/Pt系统，但可能会使用类似的技术。这个表征过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它提供了关于表面成分、覆盖率和热稳定性的基本信息。这些数据为准确模拟系统、进行相关计算以及在表面科学和催化研究背景下解释实验结果奠定了基础。
