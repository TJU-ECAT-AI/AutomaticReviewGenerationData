[1] "Our research has previously focused on studying the effect of Ni deposition on Pt(1 1 1). This paper focuses on understanding the properties of the reverse deposition conditions, i.e. depositing Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."

[2] "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

[3] "Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

[4] "The Pt/Ni AES ratio begins to decrease at approximately 600 K and most of the Pt has diffused into the bulk of Ni(1 1 1) by temperatures around 1000 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is typically conducted using various surface science techniques, though this specific paper focuses on the reverse system (Pt on Ni). For Pt/Ni surfaces, Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) was used to characterize the surfaces. The researchers estimated that a monolayer of Pt corresponded to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8. They also studied the thermal stability of the Pt overlayers, finding that Pt begins to diffuse into the Ni bulk at around 600 K, with most Pt diffused by 1000 K.

While not directly addressing Ni/Pt surfaces, this study of the reverse system provides valuable insights into bimetallic surface characterization. Such detailed surface characterization is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations, as it provides essential information about surface composition, coverage, and thermal stability. This information forms the basis for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, which is vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

虽然这篇论文主要关注Pt/Ni表面，但Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常使用各种表面科学技术进行。对于Pt/Ni表面，研究人员使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）进行表征。他们估计一个单层的Pt对应的Pt/Ni AES比率为0.8。他们还研究了Pt覆盖层的热稳定性，发现Pt在约600 K开始扩散到Ni体相中，到1000 K时大部分Pt已经扩散。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及Ni/Pt表面，但对反向系统的研究为双金属表面表征提供了宝贵的见解。这种详细的表面表征对于结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算至关重要，因为它提供了有关表面组成、覆盖度和热稳定性的基本信息。这些信息为理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质奠定了基础，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
