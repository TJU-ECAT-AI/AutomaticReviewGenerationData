[1] "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

[2] "Assuming the formation of uniform Pt overlayers, we have estimated an approximate monolayer of Pt would correspond to a Pt/Ni AES ratio of 0.8."

[3] "A previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) and density functional theory study (DFT) showed that most of the Ni in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface does not remain on the surface when the Pt(1 1 1) crystal temperature is 600 K"

[4] "The segregation energies of Ni in Pt also suggest that Ni prefers to diffuse into Pt(1 1 1)"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using multiple complementary techniques:

1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) is used to analyze the surface composition and estimate Pt coverage.

2. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) provides atomic-scale imaging of the surface structure.

3. Low-Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (LEIS) helps determine the composition of the outermost atomic layer.

4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are employed to model the surface structure and energetics.

This multi-technique approach is crucial because it provides a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surface structure, composition, and behavior under different conditions. It reveals important phenomena like Ni diffusion into the Pt substrate at elevated temperatures and surface segregation effects. This detailed characterization is essential for accurate structural modeling, reliable DFT calculations, and a thorough understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Such in-depth knowledge is critical for advancing surface science and developing more effective catalysts based on these materials.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过多种互补技术进行的：

1. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）用于分析表面组成和估计Pt覆盖率。

2. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）提供表面结构的原子尺度成像。

3. 低能离子散射谱（LEIS）有助于确定最外层原子层的组成。

4. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算用于模拟表面结构和能量学。

这种多技术方法至关重要，因为它提供了对双金属表面结构、组成和在不同条件下行为的全面理解。它揭示了重要现象，如Ni在高温下向Pt基底扩散以及表面偏析效应。这种详细的表征对于准确的结构建模、可靠的DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。这种深入的知识对于推进表面科学和开发基于这些材料的更有效的催化剂至关重要。
