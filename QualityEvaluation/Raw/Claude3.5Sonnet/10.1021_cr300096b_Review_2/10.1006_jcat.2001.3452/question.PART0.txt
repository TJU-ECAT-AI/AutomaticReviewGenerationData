Gas-phase
hydrogenation
of
crotonaldehyde
(CH3CH=
=
CHCHO) was studied over the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) and (
3 ×
3)
R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys which were used as model catalysts.
The influence of the alloy structure, hydrogen pressure, and tem-
perature on activity and selectivity toward 2-butenol (CH3CH=
=
CHCH2OH) formation was investigated. The results were com-
pared to those obtained for the pure Pt(111) surface. All catalysts
were characterized prior to use by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
and low-energy electron diffraction to ensure proper alloy forma-
tion. The hydrogenation activity was about two times higher for the
bimetallic PtSn catalysts compared to that for Pt(111); however,
little change in selectivity was observed. Butyraldehyde was
formed as the main product in all cases. Therefore, alloy formation
improves hydrogenation activity toward C=
=C and C=
=O functional
groups and cannot solely explain the improvement in selectivity
toward the formation of the unsaturated alcohol that has often been
reported for supported PtSn catalysts versus pure Pt catalysts.
Both alloys investigated had similar catalytic activity and selectiv-
ity. An attempt was made to create oxidic tin species on the Pt(111)
surface, because these species have been suggested to improve
selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol product. However, the oxidic
species formed by heating the alloys in 5 Torr O2 for 5 min at 600 K
were not stable under reaction conditions and were reduced to
form a surface with low catalytic activity, probably consisting of
metallic Sn rafts over the Pt(111) surface.

INTRODUCTION
PtSn bimetallic catalysts are known for their perfor-
mance and stability in catalytic hydrocarbon transforma-
tions. These supported PtSn catalysts have been studied
for hydrogenationdehydrogenation (1), hydrogenolysis
(2), and recently for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons
(3). In general, Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit increased
stability against coke formation and catalytic behavior
different from that of the pure Pt catalysts. Observa-
tions that alloys are formed in some catalyst systems
and the possibility that alloys are important phases in
other systems make alloys interesting targets for investiga-
tion.

In this work, we investigated PtSn surface alloys as
model, unsupported catalysts for the gas-phase hydrogena-
tion of crotonaldehyde (2-butenal, CH3CH=
=CHCHO). We
compared the activity and selectivity of these alloys to those
of similar Pt(111) model catalysts (4) and PtSn supported
catalysts studied elsewhere (1). This approach allowed us
to address some issues in the mechanism over supported
PtSn catalysts that may result from alloy formation. Using
thesesurfacealloysinsteadofsupportedbimetalliccatalysts
makes it possible to exclude the influence of several factors,
such as metalsupport interaction, incomplete reduction of
the metal phase(s), size of the active metal particles, and
sintering, which are known to strongly affect catalytic be-
havior (5).
The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated alde-
hydes to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols has in-
dustrial applications. The alcohols obtained are important
intermediates in the production of perfumes, flavorings,
and pharmaceuticals. The challenge is to selectively hydro-
genate the C=
=O bond leaving the C=
=C bond intact. The
analysis of thermodynamics shows that hydrogenation of
the C=
=C bond is more favorable than that of C=
=O hydro-
genation, forcing this reaction to be run at low temperatures
using kinetic control. However, the addition of hydrogen
to the C=
=C bond occurs faster than that to the C=
=O bond
over all known catalysts for the gas-phase hydrogenation of
unsaturated aldehydes (6). Research done using pure met-
als revealed that the activity rather than the selectivity of
the catalyst was more strongly affected by using different
metals (6). Most metals hydrogenate both double bonds to
some extent, except Pd which is known to be very selective
with respect to the C=
=C bond (7). Currently, the only way
to achieve selective hydrogenation to form the unsaturated
alcohol with high yield (99%) is by reduction using boron
or metal hydrides (NaBH4 or NaAlH4) (8). This method is
quite valuable in a laboratory but too expensive to carry out
on an industrial scale. Therefore, it is of interest to create
a selective heterogeneous catalyst that would result in an
efficient process for this reaction.
Promoters have been used to improve the selectiv-
ity of metal catalysts for the previously mentioned pro-
cesses. Three groups of promoters are commonly used (9):
alkali metal compounds, transition metal compounds, and

HYDROGENATION OF CROTONALDEHYDE OVER Sn/Pt(111)

nontransition metal additives. The last group has the most
prominent effect on catalytic behavior. Because tin belongs
to this group and is often involved in a number of bimetal-
lic catalysts, we investigated the influence of alloyed Sn on
catalytic hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde over a Pt(111)
surface.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All experiments were conducted in the apparatus shown
in Fig. 1, which consists of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
chamber and an attached, atmospheric pressure batch re-
actor. The UHV chamber was pumped by an ion pump
(240 L/s) and a cryo-pump (1500 L/s) and had a base pres-
sure of 1 × 1010 Torr. The chamber was equipped with
a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for residual gas
analysis and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD),
low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, a 180-mm
sphericalcapacitoranalyzer(SCA)forAugerelectronspec-
troscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS), a differen-
tially pumped, 5-keV ion gun, several multichannel-array
gas dosers connected to precision leak valves, and sev-
eral metal evaporators. XPS measurements were made
by using a dual-anode X-ray source with a Mg anode
(MgKα = 1253.6 eV).
The Pt crystal had two polished sides, each oriented along
the (111) crystal plane and it was spot-welded between two
tungsten wires (0.8 mm in diameter) wrapped with Pt foil at
the spot of contact with the Pt crystal. The crystal could be
resistively heated between 300 and 1200 K, as monitored
by a chromelalumel thermocouple that was spot-welded
to the side of the crystal.
FIG. 1.
Schematic drawing of the experimental apparatus.
The procedure used to obtain the PtSn alloys was sim-
ilar to that described by Paffet and Windham (10). Sn was
evaporated onto the Pt(111) surface at 300 K in UHV. This
was followed by annealing the Pt(111) crystal to 1000 K for
10 s. To ensure proper alloy formation, both LEED and
XPS analyses were done on each surface. Prior to catalytic
experiments, the alloy of interest was formed on both sides
of the crystal. Special attention was given to ensure that
the alloy formed on each of two sides of the crystal was
as similar as possible. LEED appeared the same, and XPS
revealed differences in the Pt(4f)/Sn(3d) ratio of less than
10% in all cases.
The following procedure was used to obtain a clean
Pt(111) surface. The crystal was sputtered by 1-keV Ar+
ions at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently for 5 min
at 1000 K with simultaneous exposure to 1 × 107 Torr of
oxygen; it was then annealed at 1000 K for a few minutes
in UHV. Long sputtering times were used to remove all
Sn from the near-surface region. After this cleaning pro-
cedure, the amount of Sn and carbon on the surface, along
with most other common contaminants, was below the XPS
detection limit.
The UHV chamber was connected directly through a
4.5-in. gate valve to a stainless-steel batch reactor with a
volume of 480 cm3 that could be pressurized up to 1-atm
pressure. The composition of the gas in the reactor cell was
analyzed with a HewlettPackard 5890 gas chromatograph
equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). An evac-
uated loop was used to sample the reaction mixture, and an
AT-1000 (0.53-mm-diameter, 30-m-long) capillary column
was used for product separation.
The Pt crystal was transferred between the UHV analy-
sis chamber and the high-pressure reactor by means of a
280
JERDEV, OLIVAS, AND KOEL
transfer rod passing through a differentially pumped as-
sembly of sliding seals. The reactor was sealed by the slid-
ing seal at one end and by the gate valve separating the
high-pressure cell from the UHV chamber at the other end.
The reaction cell could be evacuated with a turbomolecular
pump, and it took only a few minutes to bring the cell from
a reaction pressure of 5 Torr to a pressure low enough to
transfer the sample into the UHV chamber while maintain-
ing a background pressure of 8 × 1010 Torr. The walls of
the reaction cell were heated to 350 K during reaction mea-
surements to decrease the adsorption of crotonaldehyde.
Crotonaldehyde (Aldrich, 99+%) was purified by vac-
uum distillation prior to use. Hydrogen (Matheson,
99.9999%) was used as supplied. GC analysis of the reac-
tion mixture prior to introduction into the reactor showed
99.99 mol% crotonaldehyde with only a small amount
(<0.01 mol%) of light hydrocarbons. We also performed
blank experiments to ensure zero catalytic activity (below
1% of the least active catalyst studied) of the reactor in the
absence of a catalyst.
Catalytic results are described by selectivity, conversion,
and turnover frequencies (TOF) as defined in the following.
The selectivity Si toward a given product was determined as
Si =
ni
P
i ni
,
[1]
where ni is the mole fraction of product i in the reaction
mixture. The conversion C (mol%) is defined as
C =
1 nc
. X
ni
× 100,
[2]
where nc is the mole fraction of crotonaldehyde in the
reaction mixture, and P ni is a sum over all components
in the reaction mixture. The TOF is defined as the number
of crotonaldehyde molecules that undergo hydrogenation
per surface atom per second according to
TOF = VR × PCH × NA × (1 XCH)
R × T × t × 2pt × Spt
,
[3]
where VR is the reactor volume (3.84×104 m3), PCH is the
initial pressure of crotonaldehyde in the reaction mixture
(Pa), NA is Avogadros number, XCH is the mol% of croton-
aldehyde in the reaction mixture, R is the gas constant, T is
the temperature of the reaction mixture (350 K), 2Pt is the
surface atomic density of Pt(111) (1.505 × 1015 atoms/cm2),
t is the reaction time (seconds), and S is the total surface
area of the crystal (1.7 cm2). No correction was made a pri-
ori for the reduced number of Pt surface atoms in the alloys.
RESULTS
Catalytic hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde was carried
out for a range of temperatures between 350 and 395 K.
The temperature of the reactor walls was kept at 350 K to
avoid condensation of crotonaldehyde and other reaction
products. This temperature determined the lower end of
the temperature range. The upper end of the temperature
range, 395 K, was determined by the high conversion rates
encountered at short reaction times.
The
reaction
products
detected
were
n-butane
(CH3CH2CH2CH3), butyraldehyde (CH3CH2CH2CHO),
n-butanol
(CH3CH2CH2CH2OH),
and
crotylalcohol
(2-butenol, CH3CH=
=CHCH2OH). Under all conditions
studied for Pt(111) and both PtSn alloys, the main
hydrogenation product was butyraldehyde. The amount of
the unsaturated alcohol product crotylalcohol was at most
5 mol%.
The activity and selectivity of the (
3 ×
3)R30and
(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloys were compared at 365 K using
the lowest and highest HC : H2 ratios (1 : 100 and 1 : 800)
that we explored. These two alloys showed similar catalytic
performance, with a 10% higher overall activity for the (2×
2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy and only a marginal difference in the
selectivity. Thus, we chose to present in this paper only the
results and conclusions that were specific for the (2 × 2)
Sn/Pt(111) alloy. However, these should also be applicable
to the (
3×
3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy except for the small
differences that were mentioned.
There was no evidence for surface carbon buildup under
any conditions on the alloy catalyst. XPS measurements
of the carbon coverage taken 20 s after the introduction
of the alloy catalyst into the reaction cell showed essentially
the same amount of carbon (2C = 0.5 monolayer (ML))
as that obtained after 30 min of reaction. This was a conse-
quence of the high H2 : HC ratio that was used, and allowed
us to consider that TOF values were not influenced by this
factor. The carbon coverage was calibrated with XPS by
using ethylene to produce a known coverage of ethylidyne
on Pt(111) at 300 K of 2C = 0.5 ML.
Figure 2 shows the composition of the reaction mixture
over the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy catalyst as a function of
time. The main product of the reaction was butyraldehyde
from hydrogenation of the C=
=C bond, and only a small
portion of crotonaldehyde was converted to the unsatu-
rated alcohol 2-butenol from hydrogenation of the C=
=O
bond. This was a general result for all sets of experimental
conditions that were explored.
The influence of temperature on the reaction product
yield was monitored at a fixed value of H2 : HC = 100 and
Ptotal = 5 Torr over a temperature range from 355 to 385 K.
These data are shown in Fig. 3. The rates of all monitored
processes, i.e., hydrogenation of C=
=O and C=
=C functional
groups and C=
=O bond cleavage, increased with increas-
ing temperature. No new products were detected at this
temperature range. Using these data, we calculated an ap-
parent activation energy for the hydrogenation of the C=
=C
double bond of Eapp = 8.6 kcal/mol at <10% conversion.

Composition of the reaction mixture over the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy for the initial reaction conditions: PH2 = 10 Torr, P2-butenal =
5 × 102 Torr, and T = 355 K.
This was done by assuming that the rate of C=
=C bond hy-
drogenation was much higher than that of the C=
=O bond.
This was a reasonable assumption because C=
=C bond hy-
drogenation resulting in butyraldehyde formation was the
predominant reaction pathway, as shown in Fig. 3.
Arrhenious plots for our results, as well as those for ref-
erence data from supported catalysts [1, 11] and another
Pt(111) model catalyst, are shown in Fig. 4. To produce
these plots for the reference catalysts, we used the hydro-
genation rate reported at a specific temperature and ex-
tended this through the indicated temperature range us-
ing the reported activation energies. Unsupported catalysts
displayed higher overall activities than supported catalysts,
although one cannot make too much of this difference, be-
cause no correction was made for differences in the pres-
sures of crotonaldehyde and hydrogen that were used. The
trends on the supported catalysts were similar to those
in our data on the unsupported catalysts. PtSn catalysts
had higher activity and lower apparent activation engergies
than pure Pt catalysts for both supported and unsupported
catalysts.
The performance of the (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) model catalyst
at 365 K was tested at a crotonaldehyde partial pressure of
5 × 102 Torr for several different HC : H2 ratios: 1 : 100,
1 : 200, 1 : 400, and 1 : 800. Figure 5 shows these results. The
rates of formation for all products were positively influ-
enced by H2 partial pressure except that for n-butane which
remained nearly constant. The existence of a critical hydro-
gen partial pressure, above which the reaction rate stops
increasing with an increase in H2 partial pressure, was not
encountered in these measurements. This indicates that the
rates of all of the reactions, except that of C=
=O bond cleav-
age, are proportional to the surface hydrogen concentration
which is involved in the limiting steps of these reactions.
Figure 6 quantifies the influence of H2 partial pressure
on the total conversion of crotonaldehyde. As shown in
Fig. 6, experiments performed under the same conditions
on Pt(111) revealed that the order with respect to H2 was
0.5, significantly lower than that for both PtSn alloys
which was 0.9. Because the rate of C=
=C bond hydrogena-
tion was much higher than that of the C=
=O bond, this order
was mostly related to C=
=C bond hydrogenation.
Influence of Oxygen Pretreatment
In an attempt to explore the role of metal cations or ox-
idic species on the selectivity for this catalysis, we tried
to produce such species by direct oxidation of the SnPt
alloy model catalysts. For these experiments, the (2 × 2)
Sn/Pt(111) alloy was prepared as usual, but it was then ex-
posed to 1 Torr O2 at 600 K for 5 min in the high-pressure
cell prior to use as a catalyst. This treatment produced SnOx
species at the surface (12), which we expected would then
improve the selectivity toward formation of unsaturated
aldehyde based on previous proposals in the supported
catalyst literature (13). In addition, we hoped that this
experiment would check how exposure of the catalyst to
conditions similar to those used industrially for catalytic
regeneration might influence catalytic properties.
XPS was used to monitor the amount of oxygen and
oxidation states of Sn and Pt before and after oxidation
and upon completion of catalytic reactions, as shown in
Fig. 7. The 0.8-eV shift of the Sn(3d) peak after the fresh
(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy was exposed to oxygen indicated
the oxidation of Sn. The total oxygen coverage following
this oxidation pretreatment was 1.2 ML. The determina-
tion of the Sn oxidation state (II or IV) using XPS is usu-
ally regarded as difficult, because nearly identical chemical

shifts were reported (14) for those oxidation states. Our
XPS results for these surfaces (15) allowed us to exclude
formation of SnO2 (Sn IV) under these conditions, and we
assigned the oxidized forms of Sn shown in Fig. 7b to the
so-called quasimetallic form (16) of Sn (485.6 eV binding
energy (BE)) and SnO (486.15 eV BE). The total Sn frac-
tion that was oxidized in one form or the other was equal
to 0.9.
Table 1 shows that this oxygen treatment significantly
decreased the activity of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy in
subsequent catalytic reactions. The catalytic activity for this
samplewaslowerthanthatforeitherthepurePt(111)orthe
(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy. However, it is evident from Fig. 7c
that when the oxidized PtSn alloy was exposed at 365 K to
the reaction mixture containing hydrogen, Sn was comp-
letely reduced to metallic form. Recent XPS and scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) studies on these same SnPt
alloys (17) showed that oxidation takes place by abstraction
of Sn from the alloy to form various SnOx adlayers at the
surface. Reduction of this adlayer forms Sn that remains
in an adlayer, possibly as Sn rafts, blocking most of the
Pt(111) surface. This is because alloying of Sn on Pt(111)
requires high temperatures (>600 K) (18). Because Sn
itself is not a good catalyst, this results in a sample with
low catalytic activity.
We were able to restore the activity of the preoxidized
catalyst to that of the normally prepared surface alloy by
reduction in 1 Torr H2 at 600 K for 1 min. This result in-
dictes that oxidationreduction cycles at 600 K can form
an alloy catalyst. Oxygen treatments are commonly used to
remove surface carbon deposits, but in the case of PtSn
bimetallic catalysts, this treatment also enriches the surface

occur during the subsequent reduction or activation stage.
It is useful to compare these results on a preoxidized cata-
lysttosimilarexperimentsperformedbyColomnaetal.(19)
on silica and alumina supported PtSn catalysts. They used
oxygen pretreatment to elucidate the role of oxidized tin
speciesinthecatalyticbehaviorofPtSn/SiO2 catalysts.They
reportedreducedactivityforoxidizedsamplescompared to
those not oxidized, and our observations are similar to
theirs. They also reported that the total amount of oxi-
dized tin was 83%, which is close to our value of 90%. In
addition,theyreportedsomeincreaseintheactivityofthese
catalysts when the oxidation was performed at elevated
temperatures (673 K). This treatment may form ordered
tin oxide phases, based on studies done in our group (20),
showing that tin oxide overlayers order into well-defined
structures on the Pt(111) surface at temperatures above
800 K. This phenomenon may occur on supported catalysts
at lower temperatures because of the various metal surface
planes exposed, smaller metal particle size, or higher oxy-
gen pressure, and it may account for the changes observed
in catalytic activity.
DISCUSSION
To obtain kinetic parameters for 2-butenal hydrogena-
tion reactions, we constructed a kinetic model according to
the simplified reaction scheme shown in Fig. 8. All reaction
pathways that were considered are shown as arrows, with
a rate constant for each pathway shown above the arrow.
This reaction network can be represented as a system of
differential equations; for example,







dC0/dt = (k1 + k2 + k3) × C0
dC1/dt = k1 × C0 k4 × C1
dC2/dt = k2 × C0 k5 × C2
dC3/dt = k3 × C0
dC4/dt = k5 × C2 + k4 × C1,
[4]
where C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4 are molar concentrations of
crotonaldehyde, butyraldehyde, 2-butenol, n-butane, and
n-butanol, respectively. At t = 0, C0 = 100% and the con-
centrations of all products were zero.
Within this model, crotonaldehyde can be hydrogenated
to butyraldehyde, 2-butenol, and to n-butane. The first two
products are considered to be intermediates that could
be hydrogenated further to form n-butanol. The solu-
tion to Eq. [4] provides values for these rate constants.
This system of equations was solved numerically using the
Euler method. The solutions to Eq. [4] at Ptotal = 10 Torr,
HC/H2 = 1 : 200, and T = 365 K are given as solid lines
along with the experimental data points in Fig. 2. All of
the rate constants determined in this manner are listed in
Table 2. Because the model curves describe the experimen-
tal behavior quite well, we believe that the model shown in
Fig. 8 is a reasonable approximation.
This kinetic analysis shows that the hydrogenation rate of
the C=
=O bond by the (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) catalyst is 18 times
slower than that of the C=
=C bond. Also, the rate constants
for primary (from crotonaldehyde, k1) and secondary (from
2-butenal, k5) C=
=C bond hydrogenation are similar (1.66×
101 versus1.05×101),whilerateconstantsfortheprimary

(k2) and secondary (k4) C=
=O bond hydrogenation differ by
a factor of 3 (9.0×103 versus 3.0×103). The presence of
the C=

hasnoC=

residence time for crotonaldehyde or possibly a change in
the reaction mechanism due to conjugation between C=

and C=
=O bonds.
A discussion of the mechanism of crotonaldehyde hy-
drogenation on PtSn alloys benefits from insights that
arise from basic studies of adsorption on Pt and PtSn sur-
faces. Acrolein and crotonaldehyde adsorption on Pt(111)
was studied by Jesus and Zaera (21) by using reflection
absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and TPD. To
our knowledge, no similar work using these molecules on
PtSn alloys has been done yet, but such studies are planned
in our laboratory.
TPD studies of crotonaldehyde adsorption on Pt(111)
(21) revealed complete decomposition to yield only H2 and
CO desorption products under UHV conditions. No hydro-
carbon desorption was observed. This indicates strong, irre-
versible chemisorption. At submonolayer coverages of cro-
tonaldehyde, the ν(C=
=O) stretching mode was observed at
nearly the same position as that for a condensed phase, mul-
tilayer sample, but it had a weak intensity. Jesus and Zaera
(21) concluded that the C=
=O bond was oriented parallel to
the surface and interacted only weakly with it. It was con-
cluded that crotonaldehyde was strongly chemisorbed on
the Pt(111) surface by nearly complete rehybridization of
the C=
=C bond to give a peak at 1077 cm1 and a formation
of two PtC σ bonds with the surface, as shown in Fig. 9a.
Semiempirical extended Huckel calculations support this
picture (22). A limiting case for di-σ-bonded adsorption
through rehybridization of the C=
=O bond is shown in

teract weakly with Pt surfaces by forming a dative bond via

C=
=C and C=
=O double bonds are conjugated and oriented
in the plane parallel to the surface as shown in Fig. 9c.
The adsorption energy for crotonaldehyde on these sur-
faces may help to explain the different dependencies on
hydrogen pressure. We observed a positive order with re-
spect to hydrogen pressure on all surfaces, with values of 0.9
on the PtSn alloys and 0.5 on Pt(111). For hydrogenation
of the C=
=C bond, the rate should depend on both surface
hydrogen concentration and crotonaldehyde adsorption
energy. Previous studies of olefins (24) lead us to expect that
crotonaldehyde is more weakly bound to the alloys than to
Pt(111),andthusH2 pressureshouldhaveamoreimportant
effect on the rate on the alloys than on the Pt(111) surface. If
breaking the PtC bond is involved in the rate-determining

step, this could also explain the lower apparent activation
energies on the alloys compared to those on Pt(111), which
are 8.6 kcal/mol for the two PtSn alloys and 10.8 kcal/mol
for Pt(111).
The full hydrogenation of 2-butenal to n-butane proceeds
via the cleavage of the COH bond, as shown in Fig. 9d. This
hydrogenation pathway, as we mentioned when discussing
Fig. 5, is the only one which does not depend on the hydro-
gen partial pressure. The overall process for producing bu-
tane includes a number of elementary steps such as COH
bond cleavage, hydrogenation of surface intermediates, and
desorption of the butane and water products. Surface sci-
ence studies showed that desorption of butane (25) and
water (26) was very fast under catalytic conditions. Among
the remaining steps, only COH cleavage does not directly
involve hydrogen, and we can conclude that this must be
the limiting step for the full hydrogenation process. The
fact that hydrogenation of alkyl groups is not rate limiting
is consistent with expectations based on observations that
such reactions are facile on Pt(111) and these PtSn alloys.
If we assume that COH cleavage is the limiting step for
n-butane formation, then we can use the rate of n-butane
formation versus temperature data to calculate an activa-
tion energy for COH bond cleavage. We determine a value
of 11.2 kcal/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy. If the alloys follow the
same trend as that on Pt(111), where the activation ener-

gies for C=

an increase in temperature will favor n-butane production.
Another feature observed in Figs. 3 and 5 was that there
were two distinct regimes in the rate of n-butane produc-
tion; i.e., all curves for the n-butane yield clearly displayed
a break or change in slope as a function of time. The
first regime was observed at low conversion when the most
abundant component in the reaction mixture was croton-
aldehyde which could be characterized by a fairly high rate
of n-butane production. The second regime was observed at
higher conversions and had a lower rate primarily because
n-butane formation under these conditions occurred from
butyraldehyde. This interpretation implies that adsorbed
species containing a C=
=C double bond are more suscepti-
ble to COH cleavage.

PtSn surface alloy catalysts compared to that on Pt(111)
is an increased activity for all hydrogenation reactions that
were monitored. Both C=
=O and C=
=C hydrogenation reac-
tions were promoted to an equal extent. One factor influ-
encing this increased activity is a change in the electronic
state of Pt that is induced by alloying with Sn. This change
influences the bond strength between the adsorbed species
and the surface. It was reported that such hydrogenation re-
actions occured faster on surfaces with decreased electron
density (27). While no significant shifts occur in the Pt core
levels due to formation of the surface alloys (28), there is a
reduction in the density of states at EF that is revealed in
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (29). Furthermore,
recent scanning tunneling microscopy studies (30) reported
an electronic contrast for Pt atoms depending on the
number of Sn neighbors bonded to a Pt atom, and this gives
direct evidence for charge transfer from Pt to Sn to reduce
the electron density at Pt sites. This then presents a consis-
tent picture for explaining our catalytic results. Second, the
ensemble size of contiguous reactive Pt atoms at the surface
is changed by alloying with Sn. However, since hydrogena-
tion reactions do not require large ensembles, the reduced
ensemble size for the PtSn alloys should not influence this
particular type of reaction.

It is useful to compare our newly obtained results for
well-defined, unsupported PtSn alloys to results from Pt
and PtSn catalysts supported on carbon black (1). An in-
crease in the overall activity and a decrease in the appar-
ent activation energy were observed on both unsupported
and supported PtSn catalysts with respect to Pt catalysts.
The primary difference was that the TOF values reported
for the supported catalysts (1) were about 10 times lower
than those obtained in this study. Furthermore, the sup-
ported catalyst with a 25% Sn loading had twice the overall
activity of a pure Pt supported catalyst, and we also ob-
served that the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) catalyst, which had 25%
Sn atoms in the surface layer, had twice the overall activity
ofthePt(111)catalyst.However,increasingtheSncoverage
further to 33% for the (
3 ×
3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy re-
sulted in a decrease of 10% in the TOF, while for supported
catalysts, the highest activity was observed for a catalyst
with 50% Sn loading. We also did not observe a signifi-
cant change in selectivity between pure Pt and PtSn model
catalysts, whereas supported PtSn catalysts exhibited
improved selectivity for C=
=O bond hydrogenation with in-
creased Sn loading.
These differences are revealing about the origin of the
improved performance of the supported catalysts because
the unsupported catalysts are quite different, and more de-
fined, from the supported catalysts. One difference is that
the morphology of the supported catalyst is obviously dif-
ferent from that of the model catalysts. The influence of
the support is an important factor that could affect the
metal particle size, shape, and electron density, and change
adsorption energies, geometries, and reaction mechanisms.
Spillover effects that lead to communication between ad-
sorbed species on the support and metal particles can also
occur. Changing the Sn loading might and should affect
all of these interactions. Also, high Sn loadings may also
result in larger amounts of unreduced Sn present in the
catalyst that are not incorporated into PtSn alloy phases.
Our unsupported catalysts reveal the importance of PtSn
phases of specific composition and structure, thus defining
the role that these phases play in supported catalysts.
As mentioned earlier, one of the major factors thought to
influence hydrogenation selectivity of unsaturated aldehy-
des is a higher preference for adsorption via the C=
=O bond
versus the C=
=C bond. In the model proposed by Marinelli
and Ponec (31), an important factor facilitating adsorption
via the C=
=O bond was the presence of metal cations present
in oxidic phases at the catalyst surface. These species could
be produced by partial oxidation of the primary catalytic
metal component, e.g., Pt (1), during catalyst pretreatment
and by oxidation of the more electropositive promoters
such as Sn or Fe. Based on similar activities of reduced Pt
Sn and PtSnOx catalysts, it was concluded that the promo-
tion effect was a result of cations which survived reduction
or were formed upon initial contact with the aldehyde (32).
The latter possibility was supported by the observation that
the activity increased when CO pulses were added to the
reaction mixture (31). Our results on the reduced PtSn al-
loy model catalyst show that alloy phases alone do not lead
to an increase in selectivity. To this extent, our results are
consistent with the explanation of Marinelli and Ponec (31)
concerning supported catalysts.
The results after preoxidation of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111)
alloy differ significantly from those obtained previously for
freshly prepared PtSn catalysts supported on carbon black
(1) in which most of the Sn and a significant amount of
the Pt were oxidized. While we found complete reduction
of SnOx on our model catalysts, only 11% of the total Sn
loading was reduced on the supported catalyst even after
thermal treatment in hydrogen (12 h in H2 flow at 760 Torr
at 623 K). Carbon black is an inert support, interacting only
weakly with supported metal particles; thus, the observed
difference in the extent of Sn reduction must be a result of
the nature of the phase and domain size of SnOx formed
and/or of the chemical state of Pt. On carbon black some
of the supported Pt prior to reduction was found to be in
oxidic form (i.e., Pt (II)). We did not observe any changes in

JERDEV, OLIVAS, AND KOEL
the Pt(4f) XPS peak position after our oxygen treatment,
indicating that oxidation under our conditions preserved
Pt in a metallic state. This decreased the thermal stabil-
ity of SnOx species (33) and increased their reducibility
by H2.
Further work is needed to clarify the influence of oxidic
species on selectivity. Because SnOx species formed by ox-
idation of PtSn alloys are immediately reduced, we plan
work in the future with admetals forming more stable ox-
ides. The change from Sn to a more electropositive metal
such as Fe should increase the stability of oxidic species
and allow them to withstand reaction conditions that com-
pletely reduce SnOx.

temperature range from 355 to 395 K, a H2 pressure range
from 5 to 40 Torr, and a HC/H2 ratio range from 1 : 100
to 1 : 800. The PtSn alloy catalysts displayed about twice
the activity of the Pt(111) model catalyst, with the activity
of the (2 × 2) Sn/Pt(111) about 10% higher than that for
the (
3 ×
3)R30Sn/Pt(111) alloy. However, the selec-
tivity observed on all of the model catalysts was similar,
with butyraldehyde formed as the main product. We con-
clude that the improvement in selectivity toward formation
of the unsaturated alcohol that has often been reported for
PtSn catalysts versus supported pure Pt catalysts cannot
be solely due to PtSn alloy formation. PtSn alloys that
were preoxidized at 600 K in O2 had a lower catalytic ac-
tivity than either of the PtSn surface alloys or the Pt(111)
surface. We propose that this results from dealloying Sn to
form the SnOx adlayer during oxidation followed by re-
duction of the oxidic Sn to an inactive metallic Sn adlayer
during low-temperature catalytic reaction. The catalytic ac-
tivity of the preoxidized alloys can be restored to that for
the as-prepared alloys by H2 reduction at a temperature
exceeding 600 K.
