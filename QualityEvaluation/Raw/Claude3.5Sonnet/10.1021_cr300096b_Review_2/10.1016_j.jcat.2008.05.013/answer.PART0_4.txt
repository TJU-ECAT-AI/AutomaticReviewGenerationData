[1] "Kitchin et al. [28] studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[2] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces [26], [28], [32]."

[3] "Hwu et al. [31] performed high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to determine the bonding orientation of cyclohexene and its intermediates and found that cyclohexene is di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) and thick Ni film, but only weakly π-bonded on Pt-Ni-Pt(111)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through various experimental and computational techniques. Surface composition and structure are analyzed using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to determine the relative amounts of Ni and Pt in different layers. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments are used to study the binding and reactivity of adsorbates like hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces. 

High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) is employed to investigate the bonding orientations of molecules on the surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to model the electronic structure, particularly the d-band center position, and predict binding energies of adsorbates.

This comprehensive characterization is crucial because it provides detailed information about the surface composition, structure, and electronic properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. Understanding how Ni modifies the Pt surface, both when present on the surface and in the subsurface, is essential for explaining and predicting the chemical reactivity of these bimetallic systems. The combination of experimental techniques and DFT modeling allows researchers to establish structure-property relationships and gain insights into the fundamental factors governing catalytic activity, such as the correlation between d-band center position and binding energies of reactants and intermediates.

This detailed characterization enables the development of more accurate structural models for DFT calculations, which in turn provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental results and predicting the behavior of similar bimetallic systems. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach advances our understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, contributing to the broader fields of surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过各种实验和计算技术进行的。使用俄歇电子能谱(AES)分析表面组成和结构，以确定不同层中Ni和Pt的相对含量。温度程序脱附(TPD)实验用于研究氢和环己烯等吸附质在这些表面上的结合和反应性。

高分辨率电子能量损失谱(HREELS)用于研究分子在表面上的结合取向。进行密度泛函理论(DFT)计算来模拟电子结构，特别是d带中心位置，并预测吸附质的结合能。

这种全面的表征至关重要，因为它提供了有关Ni/Pt双金属表面的组成、结构和电子性质的详细信息。了解Ni在表面和亚表面存在时如何修饰Pt表面，对于解释和预测这些双金属系统的化学反应性至关重要。实验技术和DFT建模的结合使研究人员能够建立结构-性能关系，并深入了解控制催化活性的基本因素，如d带中心位置与反应物和中间体结合能之间的相关性。

这种详细的表征使得可以为DFT计算开发更准确的结构模型，进而为解释实验结果和预测类似双金属系统的行为提供理论框架。最终，这种综合方法推进了我们对双金属表面电子和化学性质的理解，为表面科学和催化研究的更广泛领域做出了贡献。
