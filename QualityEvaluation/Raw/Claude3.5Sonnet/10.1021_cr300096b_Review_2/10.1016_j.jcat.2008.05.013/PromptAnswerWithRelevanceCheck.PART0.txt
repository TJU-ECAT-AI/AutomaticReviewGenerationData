[1] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (10−7 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[2] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[3] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[4] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal substrates, is conducted through several crucial steps:

1. Surface cleaning: The Pt(111) surface is cleaned using Ne+ sputter cycles, followed by oxygen dosing and annealing.

2. Ni deposition: A Ni monolayer is deposited using physical vapor deposition. This is done by heating a Ni wire wrapped around a tungsten filament, directing the Ni vapor onto the Pt(111) surface.

3. Coverage quantification: The amount of Ni deposited is determined using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), measuring the Ni/Pt peak-to-peak ratio. The goal is to achieve approximately one monolayer coverage.

4. Surface structure analysis: For surface alloys formed by annealing, the composition is typically 80% Pt in the first atomic layer and 80% Ni in the second atomic layer.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because:

1. It ensures a well-defined, clean starting surface.
2. It allows precise control and measurement of the Ni coverage.
3. It provides information on the surface composition and structure, which is essential for accurate modeling and calculations.
4. It enables researchers to correlate the surface structure with observed electronic and chemical properties.

By thoroughly characterizing these surfaces, researchers can develop more accurate models and perform more reliable DFT calculations, leading to a deeper understanding of the bimetallic surfaces' behavior in catalysis and other applications.

[1] "Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[2] "The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces."

[3] "Although the deposition of 3d metals on Pt(111) at 300 K appears to follow the layer-by-layer growth mechanism, as indicated by the distinct breaks in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 for Fe and Cu deposition and in previously published AES calibration curves for Ni and Co deposition, a fraction of 3d atoms likely will form a second layer prior to the completion of the first monolayer."

[4] "In addition, deposition at the elevated temperature of 600 K leads to the diffusion of 3d metals into the subsurface region, but the composition of each layer is not exactly the ideal Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure."

[5] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces"
