[1] "Kitchin et al. studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[2] "The current study extends these findings to Fe-, Co-, and Cu-modified Pt(111) surfaces."

[3] "Although the deposition of 3d metals on Pt(111) at 300 K appears to follow the layer-by-layer growth mechanism, as indicated by the distinct breaks in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 for Fe and Cu deposition and in previously published AES calibration curves for Ni and Co deposition, a fraction of 3d atoms likely will form a second layer prior to the completion of the first monolayer."

[4] "In addition, deposition at the elevated temperature of 600 K leads to the diffusion of 3d metals into the subsurface region, but the composition of each layer is not exactly the ideal Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure."

[5] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling. Key aspects include:

1. Deposition method: Ni is deposited on Pt(111) substrates at different temperatures (300K and 600K) to create surface and subsurface structures.

2. Structural analysis: Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) is used to monitor the growth and thermal behavior of Ni layers on Pt(111).

3. Electronic properties: The surface d-band center is studied to understand how Ni modification affects the electronic structure of Pt(111).

4. Composition analysis: The actual composition of the bimetallic surfaces is determined, showing that the ideal Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure is an approximation.

5. Theoretical modeling: DFT calculations are performed to predict binding energies and electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces.

This comprehensive characterization is crucial because it provides a detailed understanding of the surface structure, composition, and electronic properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which in turn enable predictions of catalytic behavior. By combining experimental and theoretical approaches, researchers can develop a more complete understanding of how the addition of Ni modifies the properties of Pt surfaces, leading to insights that can guide the design of advanced catalysts for various applications.
