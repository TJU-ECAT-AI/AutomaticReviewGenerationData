[1] "To study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation, a monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal."

[2] "Kitchin et al. [28] studied Ni modification of Pt(111) and found that surface Ni shifts the surface d-band center closer to the Fermi level in comparison to Ni(111), whereas subsurface Ni in the second atomic layer moves the d-band center away from the Fermi level."

[3] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (5 × 10−8 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min. The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition."

[4] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through several key steps:

1. Preparation of a clean Pt(111) surface through Ne+ sputtering, annealing, and oxygen dosing.

2. Deposition of a Ni monolayer using physical vapor deposition.

3. Quantification of the deposited Ni using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), specifically by measuring the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) peak-to-peak ratio.

4. Analysis of the surface electronic properties, particularly the d-band center, using techniques like density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

This characterization process is crucial for several reasons:

1. It ensures a well-defined, clean starting surface for consistent and reproducible results.

2. It allows precise control and measurement of the Ni coverage, which is essential for understanding structure-property relationships.

3. It enables the study of how Ni modification affects the electronic structure of Pt(111), particularly the surface d-band center, which is a key parameter in predicting catalytic properties.

4. It provides a foundation for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which are essential for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

5. It allows researchers to correlate surface structure with observed chemical properties, advancing our understanding of catalysis on bimetallic surfaces.

This comprehensive characterization approach is essential for developing a thorough understanding of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which has significant implications for catalysis research and the design of advanced catalytic materials.
