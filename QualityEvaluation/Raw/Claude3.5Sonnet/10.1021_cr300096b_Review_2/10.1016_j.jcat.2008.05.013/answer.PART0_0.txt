[1] "Before each experiment, the Pt(111) surface was cleaned by several Ne+ sputter cycles at 600 K, with subsequent flashes to 1050 K. This was followed by oxygen dosing (10−7 Torr for 50 s) at 890 K and annealing at 1050 K for 5 min."

[2] "The surface was then modified by depositing a 3d metal using physical vapor deposition. This was accomplished by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of the desired 3d metal around a 0.5 mm diameter tungsten wire, winding this into a filament, and enclosing the filament in a stainless steel shield to direct the 3d metal vapor onto the Pt(111) surface when the filament is resistively heated with a DC power supply."

[3] "The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements. Each surface was prepared with a coverage of approximately one monolayer (ML) of the respective 3d metal, which was deposited at a rate of 0.2–0.3 ML/min."

[4] "For example, in surface alloys formed by annealing a surface monolayer of 3d metal deposited onto Pt(111), the Pt composition at the first atomic layer and that of the 3d metal in the second atomic layer are typically 80% for Co and Ni bimetallic surfaces"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal substrates, is conducted through several crucial steps:

1. Surface cleaning: The Pt(111) surface is cleaned using Ne+ sputter cycles, followed by oxygen dosing and annealing.

2. Ni deposition: A Ni monolayer is deposited using physical vapor deposition. This is done by heating a Ni wire wrapped around a tungsten filament, directing the Ni vapor onto the Pt(111) surface.

3. Coverage quantification: The amount of Ni deposited is determined using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), measuring the Ni/Pt peak-to-peak ratio. The goal is to achieve approximately one monolayer coverage.

4. Surface structure analysis: For surface alloys formed by annealing, the composition is typically 80% Pt in the first atomic layer and 80% Ni in the second atomic layer.

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because:

1. It ensures a well-defined, clean starting surface.
2. It allows precise control and measurement of the Ni coverage.
3. It provides information on the surface composition and structure, which is essential for accurate modeling and calculations.
4. It enables researchers to correlate the surface structure with observed electronic and chemical properties.

By thoroughly characterizing these surfaces, researchers can develop more accurate models and perform more reliable DFT calculations, leading to a deeper understanding of the bimetallic surfaces' behavior in catalysis and other applications.

通过在Pt(111)单晶衬底上沉积Ni单层而合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过几个关键步骤进行：

1. 表面清洁：使用Ne+溅射循环清洁Pt(111)表面，然后进行氧气剂量处理和退火。

2. Ni沉积：使用物理气相沉积法沉积Ni单层。这是通过加热缠绕在钨丝上的Ni线来实现的，将Ni蒸气引导到Pt(111)表面。

3. 覆盖率量化：使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）测量Ni/Pt峰高比来确定沉积的Ni量。目标是实现大约一个单层的覆盖率。

4. 表面结构分析：对于通过退火形成的表面合金，第一原子层通常由80%的Pt组成，第二原子层由80%的Ni组成。

这个表征过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为：

1. 它确保了一个明确定义的、干净的起始表面。
2. 它允许精确控制和测量Ni的覆盖率。
3. 它提供了表面组成和结构的信息，这对于准确的建模和计算至关重要。
4. 它使研究人员能够将表面结构与观察到的电子和化学性质相关联。

通过对这些表面进行全面表征，研究人员可以开发更准确的模型并进行更可靠的DFT计算，从而深入了解双金属表面在催化和其他应用中的行为。
