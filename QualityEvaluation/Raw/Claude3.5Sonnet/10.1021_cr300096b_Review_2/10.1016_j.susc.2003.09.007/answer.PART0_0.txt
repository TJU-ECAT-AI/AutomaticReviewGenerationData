[1] "Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Ni onto Pt(1 1 1) single crystals at 300 K with and without subsequent annealing at 600 K, and by direct deposition of Ni at 600 K."

[2] "The structure, composition and chemical properties of these surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."

[3] "Density functional theory calculations showed that subsurface Ni atoms could leads to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms."

[4] "To further elucidate the surface composition, LEIS (1 keV He+) and grazing emission XPS were used to monitor the surface composition of Ni/Pt(1 1 1) following deposition of Ni at 300 and 600 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a comprehensive set of surface science techniques:

1. Physical vapor deposition is used to synthesize the surfaces by depositing Ni onto Pt(111) single crystals at different temperatures and with/without annealing.

2. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of H2 is employed to study the chemical properties and bonding strength.

3. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to investigate the surface structure and morphology.

4. Low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) provides information on the outermost surface composition.

5. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), particularly grazing emission XPS, is utilized to analyze the near-surface composition and chemical states.

6. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) is used to monitor surface composition.

This multi-technique characterization process is crucial because it provides a comprehensive understanding of the surface structure, composition, and chemical properties. This information is essential for accurate structural modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The experimental data obtained from these techniques allows researchers to validate and refine their theoretical models, ensuring that the DFT calculations accurately represent the real bimetallic surfaces.

Furthermore, this thorough characterization enables researchers to correlate the observed electronic and chemical properties with the specific structural features of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This correlation is vital for advancing surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in understanding how the presence of subsurface Ni atoms modifies the electronic structure of surface Pt atoms, leading to changes in chemical bonding and catalytic properties.
