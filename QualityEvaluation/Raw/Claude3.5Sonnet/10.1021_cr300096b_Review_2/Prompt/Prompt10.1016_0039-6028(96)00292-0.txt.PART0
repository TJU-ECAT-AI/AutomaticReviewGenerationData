Abstract 
Low energy Li + ion scattering with a combination of LEED has been used to study thin Pt films on Cu(111) deposited at 
room temperature ( < 50C) and subsequently heated. At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu(111) in the regular fcc 
stacking sequence for a thickness of at least five monolayers. For the annealing temperature of  300C, Pt-Cu intermixing 
was observed, forming a metastable Cu3Pt surface alloy. Analysis of the surface layers was made by analysing the incident 
angle dependence associated with shadowing effects and comparison to the results obtained from a bulk Cu3Pt(111) single 
crystal, revealing that the alloy is Cu3Pt(111) phase over at least three atomic layers. Neither CuPt(111) nor CuPt3(111) 
surface phase has been evidenced in this study.

1. Introduction 
In recent years there has been a growing interest 
in the growth of thin films on metal substrates due to 
the fundamental importance of these systems in both 
heterogeneous catalysis and surface science. Pt-based 
alloys have very useful properties, particularly in 
respect of their industrial applications for hydrocar- 
bon reactions and oxidation of CO to CO 
2 [1]. 
Studies of the growth mode and electronic struc- 
ture of thin Pt films on Cu(lll) have been carried 
out recently by Belkhou et al. [2] using a combina- 
tion of AES, LEED, PES and XPD. They propose a 
layer-by-layer growth mode at room temperature 
(RT) using AES for analysis of the growing Pt films. 
For the annealing temperature of  315C the Pt

atoms diffuse into the Cu(lll) substrate and a sur- 
face alloy is formed. However, the precise surface 
composition, stacking and structure of Pt layers on 
Cu(111) have not been studied. 
We have chosen the Pt/Cu(111) system as part of 
our research project on thin films and surface alloys 
for surface analysis. In the present study we report 
the first LEIS measurements for thin Pt films on 
Cu(111) deposited at RT (_< 50C) and subsequently 
annealed. LEIS is especially well suited for this 
study since it has extreme sensitivity to the surface 
layers of the thin film and the alloy [3-5]. 
2. Experimental

lutron ion source and experimental method have 
been described previously [6]. The UHV chamber

( 1 X 10 
-1 mbar base pressure) was equipped 
with a three-grid LEED unit. The 1000 eV Li + ions 
for ion scattering analysis were well focused, mass 
analyzed, and finally collimated into a beam  2 
mm in diameter at a typical current of about  100 
pA. The scattered ions were energy analyzed by a 
hemispherical electrostatic analyzer (AE/E= 
0.02) 
with multichannel detection. 
Platinum was deposited via a home-built evapora- 
tor source at a rate of 0.4 ML/min onto the substrate 
at RT and at a pressure of <4X 
10 -l mbar. The 
coverage calibration was achieved with LEIS by 
measuring the film signal as a function of Pt deposi- 
tion time in conditions where no dissolution of Pt 
into the Cu(lll) substrate takes place [7]. The 
Cu(lll) sample was cleaned by a standard proce- 
dure. Before each new deposition, the sample was 
cleaned by ion bombardment and annealing. For 
quantification of the LEIS measurements, pure 
Cu(lll) and Pt(lll) standards have been used [6]. 
3. Results and discussion 
The (1 X 1) LEED pattern was observed for Pt 
deposition at RT and after annealing independent of 
coverage. There was no drastic increase in back- 
ground intensity excluding a large amount of disor- 
dered Pt atoms. For coverage up to  1 ML, a 
three-fold symmetry of the fcc structure remained 
unchanged, indicating a quasi-epitaxial growth. At 3 
ML Pt, we detected  3% change of the position of 
the first order spots (at fixed energy), which is in 
agreement with the large mismatch ( 8.7%) of Cu 
and Pt lattices. At 5 ML Pt, the LEED pattern 
showed a Pt(111)-like structure. 
The ordering and symmetry of thin Pt films up to 
a few monolayers have been determined by monitor- 
ing the Pt signals obtained at grazing incidence. Figs. 
la and lb show the typical azimuthal scans for Pt 
coverage of 1.2 ML deposited at RT before and after 
annealing to 300C. For comparison, the b scans 
from the clean Cu(lll) and Cu3Pt(lll) surfaces 
under the same scattering geometrical conditions are 
also shown in Figs. lc and ld, respectively. At 
as-deposited surface, only the Pt signals are ob- 
served, showing the azimuthal dependence along the 
low index directions although the main shadowing

annealed to 300C, both Pt and Cu are detectable due 
to interdiffusion. The fact that the Pt and Cu b scans 
are nearly identical in shape (Fig. lb) compared to

the scans from Cu3Pt(lll) (Fig. ld) reveals the 
formation of a Cu3Pt surface alloy. The azimuthal 
data presented here cannot, however, determine the 
elemental ordering of the Cu-Pt surface, but the 
LEED patterns certainly suggest no long range order 
on the surface alloy (see photographs of the LEED 
patterns on the right-hand side of the figure). 
Fig. 2 shows the a scans (measured from the 
plane of the surface) of the Pt signals along the [121] 
azimuth at a scattering angle of 9 = 130 
, collected 
as a function of coverage. Pt deposition results in an 
increase in the first Pt shadowing peak with increas- 
ing Pt coverages. This is due to the first overlayer Pt 
shadowing of the first oveflayer Pt. At Pt coverage 
of 1.0 ML, the first Pt shadowing peak becomes 
pronounced. The fact that there are no extra Pt 
shadowing features to appear at higher incident an- 
gles at monolayer coverage is in good agreement 
with a layer-by-layer growth mode. The third shad- 
owing peak appears at Pt coverage of 1.6 ML and 
becomes pronounced at a coverage of 3.2 ML. Note 
that near the third shadowing peak at higher incident 
angles, scattering from second and third layers is 
dominant [6]. This observation is again associated 
with the completion of  3 ML Pt and agrees with 
layer-by-layer growth up to a few layer 
s [2]. Another 
proof for the layer-by-layer growth is that the pres- 
ence of the 3.2 ML Pt overlayers also results in 
disappearance of the three Cu shadowing peaks in 
the Cu a scans (not shown), indicating that there are 
few Cu atoms in the top three layers• The most 
important feature in Fig. 2 is that along the [121] 
azimuth there are three shadowing edges (a C 
- 16 
, 
31  and 74 
) for 3.2 ML Pt film, while along the 
[112] azimuth there are only two critical angles of 
a c - 160 and 54 
 (see dashed line with open circles). 
These features are consistent with the conclusion that 
the Pt films have the regular ABCABC... stacking 
of the fcc structure. The ABAB... stacking of the 
hcp structure can be excluded. A hcp-like structure 
would lead to additional shadowing feature at around 
a = 54 
 in the [121] azimuth [7], which is not ob- 
served. The occurrence of only the fcc structure in 
two domains seems more likely. The structures and 
expected differences between hcp (0001) 
and 
fcc(111) surfaces have been discussed by us recently 
[7]. The conclusion of the Pt a scans is that Pt films 
grow in a well-oriented fcc(lll) structure up to at 
least five monolayers. 
The thermal stability of the surface alloy formed 
by annealing to 300C is also tested by measuring 
the top layer Pt and Cu signals. The results are 
shown in Fig. 3 for the top layer Pt composition as a 
function of annealing time at 300C. The surface 
alloy appears to be stable isothermally on annealing 
to 300C for times up to 60 min for 1 ML Pt 
deposition (Fig. 3a) and  80 rain for 3 ML deposi- 
tion (Fig. 3b). In both cases the final Pt composition 
after subsequent anneal at 300C shows slightly be- 
low 25%. It should be noted that little surface segre- 
gation of Cu is expected as a result of interdiffusion, 
which is in agreement with our previous study on a 
bulk Cu3Pt(111) alloy surface [6]. In addition, the 
surface alloy stoichiometry was identical when the Pt 
was deposited onto a heated (300C) substrate, or 
deposited at RT and subsequently heated. 
The insets of Fig. 3 show the surface Pt composi- 
tion change as a function of the annealing tempera- 
ture. For 1 ML Pt deposited at RT (the inset of Fig. 
924 
Y.G. Shen et al./ Surface Science 357-358 (1996) 921-925 
3a), the surface Pt composition remains fairly con- 
stant below 150C. A large change of the Pt compo- 
sition occurs at annealing temperatures from 150 to 
220C. The Pt composition shows a plateau over the 
250-350C temperature range. The Pt composition 
reduces to about 10% of its original value after 
annealing to 450C. At 550C, a nearly pure Cu 
surface layer is formed on top of a dilute Pt-Cu 
alloy. Similar annealing behaviour is observed for a 
thicker Pt film of 3 ML. The inset of Fig. 3b shows 
that no Cu is present initially at the surface of the 
thick Pt film deposited at RT. Cu is detectable at the 
surface after annealing to 150C. The plateau which 
occurs at 280-380C region is attributed to the in- 
creased stability of certain compositions of a Pt-Cu 
surface alloy. The Pt composition reaches values of 
16% and 5% of its original value at 450 and 550C, 
respectively.

Fig. 4a shows the typical a scans along the [121] 
azimuth for deposition of 3.2 ML Pt on Cu(lll) 
following annealed at 300C. The a scans measured 
for the clean Cu(111) and Cu3Pt(111) surfaces under 
the same scattering conditions are used as references, 
as shown in Figs. 4t) and 4c, respectively. The 
identical shadowing features of the Pt and Cu signals 
compared to those of Cu3Pt(111) are observed, sup- 
porting the formation of a Cu3Pt surface alloy at this 
temperature. A close inspection of scattered Pt (Cu) 
signals near the third Pt (Cu) shadowing peak (where 
scattering from second and third layers is dominant) 
in the a scans compared to those of Cu3Pt(111) 
strongly suggests that there are at least three layers 
of Cu3Pt. 
The initial growth behaviour of metal thin films 
on metal substrates is determined by energetic and 
kinetic effects. The system tends to form the energet- 
ically most favourable configuration, while kinetics 
determines the growth behaviour of the film. In most 
Y.G. Shen et aL/ Surface Science 357-358 (1996) 921-925 
925 
cases, however, thin films are grown under experi- 
mental conditions far from thermodynamical equilib- 
rium. Film growth and the resulting morphologies 
will then be governed by kinetic factors. The large 
positive surface energy difference between platinum 
and copper (Tr - 3Cu 
> 0) should favour a 3D clus- 
ter growth for Pt on Cu(111) [8]. However, this is 
not observed in this work as well as in a previous 
study [2]. It seems that the growth of metastable Pt 
overlayers on Cu(111) may be possible under some 
conditions due to kinetic limitations. In order to 
enable the layer-by-layer growth, interlayer mass 
transport must be sufficiently fast to allow atoms to 
leave the tops of islands or clusters as fast as they 
arrive. The strong tendency of the Pt overlayer to- 
ward an epitaxial growth evidenced by LEED and 
low energy Li 
+ ion scattering reflects its relatively 
strong Pt-Cu interaction. We believe that the arriv- 
ing "hot" Pt atoms at RT have sufficiently high 
mobility to obtain their quasi-equilibrium 2D config- 
uration, while the true equilibrium configuration 
would correspond to an interdiffused Pt-Cu alloy. 
The experimental observation that an fcc stacking 
sequence is adopted implies strong Pt-Pt interac- 
tions. This is in agreement with previous conclusions 
that Pt grows layer-by-layer at least up to a few 
surface layers "[2]. 
Our annealing results indicate that Pt overlayers 
on Cu(111) undergo intermixing with the substrate at 
moderate temperatures. Under appropriate annealing 
conditions ( 300C), this leads to the formation of 
a metastable surface alloy. The alloy structure was 
stable between  280-380C for 3 ML Pt, the sta- 
bility regime decreasing to  250-350C for 1 ML 
Pt. The observed composition change with tempera- 
ture strongly suggests that the stoichiometry oft he 
surface alloy is CuaPt" bulk phases of composition 
CuaPt, CuPt and CuPt 3 are known to exist [9]. A 
comparison of the Pt(Cu) oz scans between a surface 
alloy and Cu3Pt(111) bulk alloy indicates that there 
are at least three layers of Cu3Pt. However, evidence 
for surface long range ordering of the surface alloy 
was not observed during the whole course of the 
experiment. Further work is in progress to clarify 
this point. 
4. Conclusion 
The Pt film on Cu(lll) at RT grows in the 
regular fcc stacking up to at least five layers. A 
metastable surface alloy is formed on annealing to 
about 300C and is examined to consist of at least 
three layers of Cu3Pt. The surface alloy structure 
was stable between  280-380C for 3 ML Pt, the 
stability regime decreasing to  250-350C for 1 
ML Pt. Neither CuPt(lll) nor CuPt3(lll) surface 
phase has been evidenced in this study.
