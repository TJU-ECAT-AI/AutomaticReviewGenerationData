Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study of Au deposited on Pt and Re surfaces
Abstract
The growth of Au on Pt and Re sputtered and annealed surfaces was investigated by angle resolved XPS method. The shifts of Au 4f core electron binding energy were negative for Au deposited on Pt and higher in magnitude than positive shifts observed for Au on Re. The shifts did not depend on the structure of the Pt substrate surface but were affected by structure of the Re surface. More than 5 equivalent monolayers of Au on Pt were required to obtain bulk-like spectra while 2 monolayers were sufficient for Au/Re. The results suggested formation of several monolayers thick interface AuPt alloy in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface. The measured trends in Au 4f core level shifts were reproduced by those calculated using local density functional method within the initial state approximation.
1. Introduction
Intermixing and alloy formation at surfaces have been the focus of considerable interest in chemistry and physics owing to their importance in a number of technological applications including catalysis, electrochemistry, corrosion or microelectronics. Recently, considerable attention has been directed toward understanding the unusual physico-chemical properties of the dispersed gold. There is a growing evidence that chemical properties of gold clusters and thin films might become different from those of bulk gold surfaces

, but the modifications of its properties by size effects and by interaction with the supporting material are still far from being well understood. In this communication we report XPS measurements on Au/Pt and Au/Re systems in a gold coverage range from submonolayer amounts to several monolayers, and the core level and 5d-band shifts calculated using local density functional method within the initial state approximation.
2. Experimental and computational details
The XPS measurements were carried out using ESCA 310 (Gammadata Scienta) and ESCA 3 Mk II (VG Scientific) spectrometers equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source and hemispherical electron analyser. The pressure of residual gases in the spectrometer chamber was below 108 Pa. High purity (99.99%) polycrystalline Pt and Re foils were cleaned by argon ion sputtering (E=6 keV, I=40 μA). The amounts of Au (99.99%) ranging from 0.01 to 18 equivalent monolayers (ML) were vapour deposited in situ, using calibrated cold trap evaporator (VG Scientific) with the substrate kept at room temperature. Both, sputtered and annealed (900 K) surfaces were used for deposition. For each surface coverage the spectra of Au 4f, Pt 4f, Re 4f and of valence electrons were measured at several different polar angles ranging from 10 to 90. The contribution of the gold deposit to the valence band photoemission was determined by subtracting a suitably attenuated spectrum of a clean substrate surface. The attenuation was determined from intensities of the Pt 4f (Re 4f) spectra by assuming that the spectra of valence electrons and Pt 4f (Re 4f) electrons are affected by the deposited gold to the same extent. Implicit in this procedure is the assumption that the shape of the Pt substrate spectrum is not significantly changed by the deposited gold.
In calculations the tight-binding linear muffin-tin-orbital scheme in the atomic-sphere-approximation (TB-LMTO-ASA)
[5]
was utilized within the local density-functional method. This is an essentially first-principles density-functional scheme with simplified treatment of charge between the atomic spheres (ASA). The supercell method was employed with periodically repeating metallic and vacuum slabs, respectively (7-layer ideal fcc (1 1 1) or hcp (0 0 0 1) slabs with 7-layer vacuum slabs above surfaces). Our theoretical analysis is based on properties of the d-electron states. We consider (1) the shifts and local densities of the 5d-electronic states, (2) core level shifts (CLS) of 4f electrons evaluated in the initial-state approximation
[6]
,
[7]
. For d-band systems, the accuracy of this approximation varies from rather accurate to a semi-quantitative guess. We considered epitaxial (1 × 1) Au overlayers corresponding to coverage θ=1 ML and a p(2 × 2) structure with θ=0.25 ML, and a (2 × 2) ordered-alloy Au3M and AuM3 (M=Pt, Re). Atoms M reside always in ideal lattice positions with experimental MM distances. The Au atoms reside in symmetric 3-fold positions above the surface. For Pt, fcc-like sites were considered, whereas for Re, both fcc- and hcp-like adsorption sites were studied. The two latter choices yield, however, almost the same results. The AuM (subsurface) distances were assessed from metallic-radii values. The atomic-radii Au-M misfit (45%) is in the range where epitaxial Au growth might be possible. Nevertheless, some kind of local expansion near Au atoms is likely
[8]
. Within cell of reasonably small dimensions, change of AuM (subsurface) can be considered but there is no effective possibility to change atomic separations within the surface plane.
3. Results and discussion
The Au 4f7/2 core electrons of gold deposited on Pt shift with increasing coverage to higher binding energies (
Fig. 1
); the CLS amounts 0.78 eV for 0.01 ML and 0.35 eV for 1 ML. More than 5 ML of Au are required to achieve the bulk value. The size of shifts does not depend on whether the sputtered or annealed Pt surface was used for deposition. Similar behaviour of Au 4f CLS has been reported
[9]
,
[10]
for Au deposited on Pt(1 0 0) surface and explained by island growth of Au and changing contribution of the Au atoms with three different coordinations to the measured spectra. In this interpretation, it was implicitly assumed that Au/Pt interface is abrupt without any intermixing. Our results thus demonstrate that CLS of Au 4f electrons do not depend on the Pt substrate surface structure. Let us to mention that the size of the measured shifts is close to that reported for AuPt bulk alloys

and using parameters: island density 8 × 1012 cm2, shift of Au 4f7/2 level for surface and edge atoms 0.42 and 0.88 eV respectively, Re(s) and Re(a) stand for sputtered and annealed Re surface respectively.
In contrast to Au/Pt system, unexpectedly small and positive CLS of Au 4f electrons are observed for Au depositons on Re (
Fig. 1
). In difference to Pt substrate the magnitude of CLS depends on the state of the Re surface; it amounts to 0.25 eV for 0.01 ML on the sputtered Re surface but only to 0.1 eV for the annealed surface.
Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission. The magnitude of this shift was dependent on the take-off angle; it increased with decreasing take-off angle (defined from the sample surface) indicating thus presence of additional component in the spectra of Pt 4f electrons, which can be assigned to the Au/Pt interface alloy. Analogous shifts in the spectra of the Re 4f electrons have not been observed. Consequently, the results obtained seem to indicate that intermixing occurs at the Au/Pt interface in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface.
The maximum on the dependence of Au 4f7/2 line FWHM on coverage is observed for both, Au/Pt and Au/Re (
Fig. 2
). However, while for Au/Re the maximum is located at about 1 ML, it is centered at 2 ML for Au/Pt. Furthermore, the maximum for Au/Re system is so pronounced that it can be easily observed in the results obtained using unmonochromatized radiation, but very accurate measurements and monochromatized X-ray radiation are necessary for Au/Pt.

, valence band X-ray photoemission spectra of several different depositions of gold on Pt are displayed. It can be seen that lower edge of the d-band does not exhibit any pronounced shift with decreasing gold coverage, and the resulting narrowing of the d-band is due to the shift of the high binding energy component of the Au 5d-band towards lower binding energies.

The calculated CLS and d-band shifts are summarized in
Table 1
. The code used for calculations takes the scalar-relativistic corrections into account but the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not included. Since this effect plays role for gold d-states lying well below Fermi level, it is not expected to influence seriously global electronic properties such as the shift of the center of gravity (CG) of the d-band or CLS. For the energy-resolved local density of electronic states (LDOS) and for comparison with photoemission spectra, however, its inclusion might be more important
[12]
. To check this point, we have performed semi-empirical calculations for (1 × 1) monolayer of Au on Pt(1 1 1) and Re(0 0 0 1) surfaces as well as for close-packed surfaces of Au, Pt and Re, and we have compared results with SOC included and omitted, respectively. The semi-empirical model is described in detail in Ref.

Fig. 4
. shows comparison of calculations and measured valence band spectrum for Au/Pt. The semi-empirical results are in good accord with experimental spectra as shown in
Fig. 4
for 1 ML of Au on Pt. The SOC parameter, ξ for valence d-electrons of Au is rather large, ξ=0.72 eV. Inclusion of SOC thus makes the Au LDOS to move from the d-band center into two marked peaks that are located more than 1 eV below and above it (see curves (1)(3) in
Fig. 4
). For Au/Re(0 0 0 1), the agreement between calculated and measured shifts has a qualitative character since the shifts of Au bands to higher binding energies are rather exaggerated in the semi-empirical model.

For θ(Au)=0.25, we find always large negative CLS and 5d-band shifts. This is not surprising since for Au atoms with very low coordination, the band-narrowing effects
[15]
prevail. Let us note that the above geometry is probably not very realistic since for very low coverages, the adatoms will adsorb preferably at defect sites such at steps that will increase their coordination. For deposition on Re, however, we find positive shifts which can become large as the number of Re neighbours of surface Au atoms grows. If a local lattice expansion at the compressed Au atoms were introduced, some additional Au band-narrowing would result. This means that the gold CLS's are probably somewhat more negative (less positive) in bimetallic systems than those calculated here. Besides that, in transition + noble metal systems the final core-hole screening becomes stronger with increase of the transition-metal concentration
[7]
. In other words, our Au CLS prediction underestimates the negative value (overestimates the positive value) probably most in cases of low Au concentration such as the AuM3 overlayer.
4. Conclusions
Angle resolved XPS study of Au deposited on Pt and Re sputtered or annealed surfaces was performed. The core level binding energy shifts and linewidths of the Au 4f core level as a function of surface Au coverage were measured and found independent on surface structure in the case of Pt substrate. The results point to the formation of Au/Pt alloy interface in early stages of Au deposition in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface. The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation.
