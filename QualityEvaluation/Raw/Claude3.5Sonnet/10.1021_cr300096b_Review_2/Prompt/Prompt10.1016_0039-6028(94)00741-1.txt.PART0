Abstract 
LEED, AES, work function measurements and low-energy (< 30 eV) electron reflectivity spectra were used to 
characterise films of 1 to 5 monolayers thickness of Mo on a Pt(lll) surface. With the Pt surface at 300 K, vapour 
deposition of Mo produced poorly ordered mulfilayer films, which gave no LEED pattern but showed the electron 
reflectivity properties of a Mo(ll0) surface after completion of the first monolayer. The evolution of surface microstructure 
during annealing at T > 750 K was dominated by diffusion of Mo into Pt. A new surface phase was seen only during 
removal of Mo films thicker than three monolayers. The distinctive electron reflecfivity features and strong ( × V-)R30 
 
LEED pattern characteristic of this phase are attributed to separation of the ordered alloy Pt2Mo when the concentration of 
Mo diffusing into the Pt surface layers reaches the solubility limit. The electron reflectivity spectral features of the alloy 
were also seen during deposition of Mo on Pt(lll) at 600 K. 
1. Introduction 
The development of the interface between one 
transition metal with a face-centred cubic structure 
and another with a body-centred cubic structure has 
been extensively studied for the case of growth of 
ultra-thin films of platinum-group metals on both 
(110) and (100) faces of refractory bcc metals, such 
as W, Mo, Ta or Nb [1-3]. An advantage of these 
systems is that the surface mobility of the deposited 
metal usually greatly exceeds that of the substrate. 
The overlayer film then develops in a layer-by-layer 
manner. The solubility of platinum metals in the 
substrate is also very limited and interdiffusion is not

generally considered to play a significant role in 
low-temperature film growth. At high temperatures, 
however, interdiffusion of the metals becomes im- 
portant for the microstructure of the surface region. 
Formation of alloys and intermetallic compounds has 
been reported for some systems [2,3], but it is not yet 
clear if local phase equilibrium is always established 
by high-temperature annealing. 
The situation changes when films of bcc metals 
are grown on fcc metals, as the deposited metal is 
then characterised by lower surface mobility than the 
substrate metal and also has appreciable solubility in 
it. Both factors would seem to favour interdiffusion 
and alloying at the temperatures needed for growth 
of well-ordered overlayers. This is because ordering 
requires diffusion of the deposited metal and it is 
likely that surface migration of the substrate would 
also occur, at least during the initial stages of film

growth. Indeed migration of the deposited metal over 
the surface may lead directly to interface mixing as a 
result of place-exchange diffusion steps like those 
identified in field ion microscope studies of adatom 
migration on Pt and Ir surfaces [4-6]. Such a mecha- 
nism may account for the facile alloying seen during 
the growth of the first few monolayers when Ta and 
Nb films are grown on Pd(lll) surfaces at room 
temperature [7]. 
The discussion above suggests that growth of Mo 
overlayers on Pt(lll), studied in the work reported 
here, should involve interface mixing and alloy for- 
mation for a wider range of film growth conditions 
than is the case for growth of close-packed layers of 
platinum metals on Mo(ll0) surfaces. Our studies of 
the growth of (lll)-type layers of Ir on Mo(ll0) 
indicate that alloy formation may occur if films 
grown at low temperature are annealed at high tem- 
perature or when films are deposited on a hot 
Mo(ll0) surface [8]. The changes in the Ir overlayer 
structure 
seen by LEED 
resemble those 
for 
Pd/Mo(ll0), which had already been discussed in 
terms of alloy formation [9]. The Pt/Mo system 
would also be expected to show similar behaviour 
because the phase diagram indicates significant solu- 
bility of Mo in Pt below 1000 K and ordered inter- 
mediate alloy phases [10,11]. A recent study of 
Pt/Mo(ll0) confirms that there are similarities with 
the Ir/Mo(ll0) and Pd/Mo(ll0) systems, although 
Linsebigler et al. [12] concluded that the surface 
generated by annealing Pt films was not that of an 
alloy film. Field ion microscopy, however, shows 
clearly that restructuring of Pt films on Mo surfaces 
does involve alloy formation [13]. There is therefore 
a need for further information on the extent to which 
interdiffusion and alloy formation occur at interfaces 
between Mo and Pt. The behaviour of Mo films on 
Pt(lll) reported here supports the establishment of 
local phase equilibrium during annealing, with for- 
mation of an ordered alloy phase at the surface. 
2. Experimental procedures 
The experiments were carried out in a small 
ultra-high vacuum chamber fitted with LEED optics, 
facilities for gas admission, a residual gas analyser 
and a metal vapour source. The 10 nun diameter 
Pt(lll) crystal disc was mounted on a high-precision 
manipulator providing axial and azimuthal rotation 
of the crystal. A stepper motor and position sensor 
could be fitted to the axial motion to provide com- 
puter control of the angle of incidence of the electron 
beam on the crystal surface. The crystal was heated 
by radiation or electron bombardment from a tung- 
sten filament mounted close to the back face. Tem- 
peratures could be monitored with a W/W-26%Re 
thermocouple mounted on the crystal but stray elec- 
tron collection on the leads during electron bombard- 
ment introduced spurious signals that were difficult 
to evaluate. Temperatures given for annealing steps 
were obtained from separate calibration measure- 
ments made after the experiments had been com- 
pleted. The temperatures reached for the input pow- 
ers used were measured with a second thermocouple 
welded on the crystal and shielded from stray elec- 
trons. 
The crystal was cleaned by extended outgassing at 
elevated temperatures and heating in oxygen to re- 
move carbon. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen ad- 
sorbed from the residual gas could be readily de- 
sorbed by briefly heating the sample to bright red 
heat. No other impurities could be detected by AES. 
Heating to 1500 K sufficed to remove Mo deposited 
on the surface. The Mo diffused into the bulk and no 
signs of any significant build-up of the bulk concen- 
tration or segregation to the surface were seen. 
The Mo vapour source consisted of a coiled Mo 
filament surrounded by a Ta foil shield that could be 
outgassed by electron bombardment using the Mo 
filament as cathode. The assembly was mounted on a 
linear motion drive and was retracted into the side 
port except for outgassing and deposition steps. After 
outgassing the shield, the Mo filament was main- 
tained at a temperature just below that for significant 
evaporation and an electronic controller was used to 
increase the filament current to a higher constant 
level for deposition steps. Deposition was carried out 
by turning the sample to face the evaporator and 
advancing the source to a fixed position with the 
filament about 30 mm from the crystal. The surface 
concentration of Mo was determined from the ampli- 
tude of the Mo Auger peak at 186 eV. The Pt peak at 
64 eV was used to monitor the platinum concentra- 
tion. Highly reproducible doses of Mo with minimal 
outgassing were obtained over a 5 month period.

Auger spectra were obtained by using the LEED 
optics as an RFA, with the modulation voltage being 
applied to the sample. The system was interfaced to 
a PC and plotter. The computer provided the voltage 
ramps for scanning Auger spectra and for following 
changes in the work function of the sample surface 
by the retarding field method. Work function changes 
could be determined with a resolution of better than 
20 mV by finding the zero crossing point of the 
second derivative (inflection point) of the crystal 
current/voltage curve obtained by ramping the sam- 
ple potential to cut-off the electron beam. 
During development of the work function mea- 
surement procedure, it was found that the crystal 
current/retarding potential curves showed pro- 
nounced structure arising from strong Variations in 
the reflectivity of the Pt surface for electrons with 
incident energy in the range 0-30 eV, which were 
changed dramatically by depositing Mo. A procedure 
was therefore developed for recording the reflectivity 
characteristics, as the studies by Jaklevic [14] of 
electron reflectivity changes during epitaxial growth 
of fcc metal films suggested that these might provide 
further information about Mo film growth on the Pt 
surface. 
It was found most convenient to characterise the 
reflectivity by measuring the current of electrons 
reflected elastically from the crystal. The current 
was collected using the LEED optics and recorded 
by the computer, which also set the retarding poten- 
tial applied to the sample. With careful magnetic 
field trimming to eliminate stray fields, reproducible 
"spectra" showing the variation of reflected current 
with incident beam energy for the range 0-30 eV 
were recorded by ramping the sample potential. Re- 
flectivity spectra were usually measured with the 
beam at normal incidence on the crystal but could 
also be obtained for a range of polar and azimuthal 
angles. Electron energies for reflectivity spectra and 
spectral features are reported in this paper relative to 
the sample Fermi level, assuming the cathode work 
function to be 3.0 eV. 
For energies below 30 eV and normal incidence 
of the beam on a clean, unreconstructed surface, only 
the (0,0) beam is collected by the LEED optics so 
that the reflectivity spectra are effectively the low- 
energy portion of the I/V curve for this beam. The 
features of such curves were extensively studied in 
the early development of LEED [15] but have been 
rather neglected since the introduction of methods 
for surface structure determination based on LEED 
I/V data for energies above 50 eV. In the present 
work, it is assumed that the features of electron 
reflectivity spectra below 30 eV are related just as 
directly to the crystallographic and electronic struc- 
ture of the surface as at higher energy. The spectra 
can then be regarded as characteristic "fingerprints" 
of particular structures and used empirically as indi- 
cators of surface structural change. The intensity of 
reflectivity maxima should be related to the extent of 
surface ordering and intensity variations may be 
expected to provide information on the progress of 
surface structural change during growth and thermal 
treatment of Mo overlayers.

After cleaning by a high-temperature flash, the 
sample mounting cooled slowly and Mo deposition 
was usually started with the Pt crystal at nearer 400 
than 300 K. The amplitude of Pt and Mo Auger 
signals, electron reflectivity spectra and work func-

tion change were measured as a function of the 
number of Mo doses added. The Mo Auger signal 
amplitude usually grew linearly with the number of 
doses. Changes in the slope of Mo Auger signal/dose 
plots that could be interpreted as indicating mono- 
layer completion in layer-by-layer growth were seen 
occasionally but were not a regular feature of Mo 
film growth. 
The best evidence for the Pt surface being sub- 
merged by a complete monolayer of Mo came from 
work function measurements, which showed a sharp 
break, Fig. 1. The work function fell nearly linearly 
with dose to a value 0.50 _

0.02 eV below that of 
the Pt surface and thereafter dropped more slowly by 
a further 0.15 to 0.25 eV. The decrease is consistent 
with the difference in work functions of Pt(lll) and 
Mo(ll0) surfaces, with the break occurring when the 
Pt is completely covered. 
Electron reflection spectra changed substantially 
as a result of Mo deposition, Fig. 2. For the clean 
Pt(lll) surface, the spectrum for normal incidence 
of the incident beam shows a group of strong reflec- 
tion peaks near 20 eV that provides a characteristic 
"fingerprint" of this surface. Following Jaklevic and 
Davis [16], this feature arises from the (222) Bragg 
reflection band gap in Pt with a narrow peak on the

low-energy side associated with a gap at a band 
crossing. On adding Mo, the Pt features attenuated 
rapidly to a background level that decreased slowly 
with further Mo dosing and new peaks appeared at 8 
and 18 eV. The intensity of the stronger 8 eV peak 
increased linearly with Mo dose, Fig. 3, with no 
slope changes that could be attributed to layer-by- 
layer growth. The features of the new reflectivity 
spectrum, including the relative intensity of the two 
peaks, closely match those of the spectrum for a 
clean Mo(ll0) surface obtained in our apparatus. 
Mo deposition also changed the dependence of 
electron reflectivity on the angle of incidence of the 
electron beam. For the clean Pt(lll) surface at 23 
eV for example, rotating the crystal about the [12] 
direction in the surface plane showed a sharp peak in 
reflectivity for normal incidence, with equally sharp 
and intense peaks when the beam was at _
_
_
 
30 
 to the 
surface normal. The non-specular peaks are due to 
(01) and (11) diffraction beams and attain maxi- 
mum intensity as these beams cross the rotation axis. 
Deposition of Mo caused the non-specular peaks to 
decrease in intensity and to shift to _ 25 
, with the 
changes being substantially complete after adding 3 
monolayers of Mo.

Although the changes in electron reflectivity indi- 
cated that Mo deposition on the surface at room 
temperature generated a surface with low-energy 
electron reflectivity properties similar to those of 
Mo(ll0), no new diffraction spots could be detected 
by visual observation of the LEED pattern. Mo 
deposition resulted in the development of a strong 
diffuse background with the Pt spots becoming very 
weak. This indicates that the size of ordered regions 
in the Mo overlayer surface was very small, probably 
as the result of restricted mobility of Mo adatoms 
after completion of the first monolayer. 
3.2. Mo film growth at higher temperature 
Attempts were made to grow films with improved 
order by depositing Mo with the Pt crystal heated by 
radiation from a hot tungsten filament behind it. 
When the substrate was held at 430 K during the 
deposition sequence, the electron reflectivity spec- 
trum of the Mo-covered surface was the same as for 
growth at 300 K but the intensity reached a steady 
level. The spectrum was unchanged after briefly 
heating the Mo-covered crystal to 800 K and LEED 
showed a sharp pattern, which appeared to be that of 
a Mo(ll0) surface with additional satellite spots 
close to each Mo spot. 
Growth at 600 K did not lead to any further 
improvement in ordering of the Mo overlayer but 
resulted in a surface with different structural fea- 
tures. The reflectivity spectrum 'developed differ- 
ently, with the Pt surface peaks disappearing and 
being replaced by new spectral features similar to 
but less intense than those of annealed Mo-covered 
surfaces giving a sharp (vr3 
- × f3-)R30 
 LEED pat- 
tern. Weak f3- features could be detected in the 
LEED pattern of the completed film. The Pt Auger 
signal for the completed film was much larger (X 5) 
compared to that for a room temperature Mo film of 
similar thickness. It is likely that increased mobility 
of both Mo and Pt during deposition at 600 K leads 
directly to surface structural changes similar to those 
caused by annealing films grown at 300 K.

for the changes observed when Mo deposits were 
annealed at elevated temperature and the results are 
therefore described in these terms. 
No new surface structures detectable by LEED 
were seen when deposits of less than 3 monolayers 
of Mo were annealed at temperatures from 600 to 
1100 K. The Pt Auger signal increased while that for 
Mo decreased steadily towards zero, Fig. 4, indicat- 
ing that the Mo diffused into the interior of the Pt 
substrate to form a substitutional solid-solution alloy. 
No evidence of new surface structures was seen in 
the electron reflectance spectrum, which changed 
steadily towards that for clean Pt. 
Annealing Mo deposits thicker than 3 monolayers 
above 700 K also caused the surface concentration of 
Mo to fall steadily during a sequence of annealing 
steps at increasing temperature, but at higher temper- 
ature than for the thinner films, Fig. 4. For these 
thicker films, however, the composition changes in 
the surface region were accompanied by formation 
of a new ordered phase. This was detectable first 
from changes in the electron reflectance spectrum 
and by LEED at a later stage. 
LEED patterns showed additional diffuse spots 
corresponding to a (f3- × v-)R30 
 pattern after an- 
126

nealing at temperatures above 800 K, that became 
sharper and more intense as the surface concentra- 
tion of Mo decreased during subsequent anneals at 
higher temperature. The  
LEED features were 
seen over a large range in Mo Auger signal, although 
the range of Pt signal was smaller, extending approx- 
imately from 30% up to 60% of the clean surface Pt 
signal. The V- diffraction beams weakened and 
disappeared as the Mo signal intensity approached 
and decreased below that of a monolayer film de- 
posited at 300 K. The pattern was sharpest and most 
intense when the Mo signal was at a level approxi- 
mately that for 2 monolayers of Mo deposited at 300 
K, although the Pt/Mo Auger signal ratio was sig- 
nificantly larger than for the 300 K Mo ovedayer. 
This result is consistent with the presence of an alloy 
phase at the surface but surface segregation of Pt and 
partial agglomeration of Mo or alloy, exposing some 
areas of Pt-rich surface, may also affect the Pt/Mo 
signal ratio. It is therefore not justifiable to deduce a 
value for the Pt/Mo composition ratio for the or- 
dered surface phase from the Auger signal intensities 
without more information about the morphology of 
the surface region.

are referenced to the sample Fermi level. 
The electron reflectivity spectrum from annealed 
Mo deposits giving a  
LEED pattern showed 
features readily distinguishable from those of either 
Mo or Pt surfaces, Fig. 5. Since the changes in 
surface composition during annealing are thought to 
involve solution of Mo in the Pt substrate, this 
intense reflectivity spectrum is probably associated 
with formation of an ordered alloy phase. The spec- 
trum showed a strong peak at 19.5 eV and a weaker 
feature at 14 eV at the start of a rapid rise in 
reflectivity for lower energies. The most characteris- 
tic feature, however, was the sharp minimum in 
reflectivity at 15.5 eV. The angular dependence of 
reflectivity at this energy was also particularly sensi- 
tive to the changes in surface structure occurring 
during annealing, Fig. 6. 
At the energy for this minimum, 15.5 eV, the 
angular profile of the reflectivity of a 5 monolayer 
Mo film was strongly peaked for normal incidence, 
with weak shoulders due to scattering into <01> and 
<11> diffraction beams at 27.5 
 relative to the sur- 
face normal. This normal incidence peak decreased 
as the minimum developed during annealing at 600

K or above. The non-specular lobes, however, grew 
in intensity and shifted to 29 
 as the v- structure 
developed during annealing at 850-1000 K and then 
weakened again with a flLrther shift to 30 
 from the 
normal after anneals above 1050 K, when the 1 × 1 
structure pattern reappears. It is likely that the in- 
creasing strength of the non-specular diffraction 
beams, Fig. 7, was mainly due to increased long- 
range ordering of the phase characterised by the 
(v- × vr3-)R30 
 LEED pattern. The subsequent de- 
cline at higher temperature is consistent with the 
continning loss of Mo from the surface and the 
approach to a pure Pt surface seen also in the Auger 
data. 
Work function measurements and changes in the 
current threshold in the reflectivity spectra showed 
that the work function of the (vr3 
- × v- R30 
 surface 
was 0.5 eV lower than that of the clean Pt surface. 
Since the surface potential affects the refraction 
properties of the surface for electrons, it is likely that 
the work function changes, as well as changes in

4. Discussion 
The linear growth of both Mo Auger and electron 
reflectivity signals with Mo dose clearly does not 
support a simple layer-by-layer model for the growth 
of Mo films on Pt (111) at 300 K. Unfortunately, the 
absence of sharp breaks in the Auger signal/Mo 
dose plots makes it difficult to evaluate Mo cover- 
ages. Assigning the break in the work flmction ver- 
sus dose plot, Fig. 1, to completion of the first Mo 
monolayer gives a coverage scale that is consistent 
with the attenuation rate of the Pt Auger signal. It 
then follows that the Pt substrate contribution to 
electron reflection at 23 eV attenuates more rapidly 
than the 64 eV Auger signal, with the prominent 
features being almost obliterated by the first Mo 
monolayer. Such rapid attenuation emphasises the 
high surface sensitivity of reflectivity spectra, which 
was also seen in the degradation of spectra following 
overnight contamination of the surface by adsorbed 
gases. 
It is likely that the Mo growth mode at 300 K 
results from very restricted adatom mobility on the 
Mo-covered portions of the surface compared to 
mobility on the initial Pt(111) surface. The first layer 
can be visualised as growing by rapid migration of 
adatoms over platinum to the edge of Mo islands 
nucleated at steps. However, it is necessary to con- 
sider the possibilty that mixing of Mo and Pt occurs, 
as reported by Jiang, Ruckman and Strongin for the 
case of Ta and Nb films on Pd(lll) [7]. The place- 
exchange mechanism identified by Wang and Ehrlich 
[6] for adatom incorporation at steps on Ir(lll) 
provides one mechanism for mixing, although other 
displacement proceses would be required for the 
boundary of alloyed regions to propagate from a step 
into the Pt terrace. If displacement by Mo adatoms of 
Pt from the terrace at the Pt side of the interface with 
the alloyed region is not feasible, then decoration of 
steps by an alloy zone would be followed by growth 
of pure Mo islands. It is thought to be unlikely that 
such mechanisms led to extensive mixing of Pt and 
Mo during the initial stages of growth at 300 K 
128 
D. W. Bassett / Surface Science 325 (1995) 121-130 
because during growth at higher temperatures, which 
facilitate interdiffusion, the Pt Auger signal de- 
creased more slowly with Mo dose and the reflectiv- 
ity spectra evolved in a different way. The formation 
of the initial Mo layer therefore seems to resemble 
the case of Co deposition on Pt(lll) at room temper- 
ature, for which ion scattering measurements by 
Galeotti et al. indicated that no mixing occurred [17]. 
Direct evidence, for example from ion scattering, 
FIM or STM studies, is still needed to establish both 
the structure of Mo islands and the extent of any 
mixing of Mo with Pt during the inital stage of 
growth at 300 K. 
In the absence of any ordered LEED pattern at the 
monolayer stage, it must be assumed that the over- 
layer consisted of an array of small islands differ- 
ent!y positioned with respect to the Pt(lll) lattice. 
The structure of these islands is not known but, since 
Pt and Mo atoms are of similar size, it could possibly 
be close-packed or of the Mo(ll0) type. FIM studies 
of transition metal adatom and cluster diffusion indi- 
cate that Mo adatoms deposited on top of Mo islands 
probably have low mobility at room temperature, 
while clusters of three or more atoms would be 
immobile. Deposition of Mo beyond the monolayer 
stage may therefore produce a high density of small 
immobile second-layer clusters that soon added third 
and higher layers. Such a growth mode would result 
in a rather rough surface covered with a multiplicity 
of Mo crystallites too small to yield a sharp LEED 
pattern. Nevertheless, the appearance of new peaks 
in the electron reflectivity spectrum, that increase in 
intensity with the amount of Mo deposited, suggests 
the development of ordered regions in the overlayer. 
The close similarity of the spectra for multilayer 
films to the reflectivity spectrum from a Mo(ll0) 
crystal surface also strongly supports the conclu- 
sion 
that 
the 
overlayer 
always 
grew 
with 
Mo(ll0)LIPt(lll), as in the one case when a sharp 
LEED pattern was obtained after growth at 430 K. 
Increasing the substrate temperature during depo- 
sition to 400 K appeared to produce more ordered 
Mo overlayers, with improved layer-by-layer growth 
resulting from higher Mo adatom mobility. There is, 
however, a quite narrow temperature range for Such 
a growth mode that is presumably set by increased Pt 
diffusion at 600-K and above, which allows surface 
reconstruction and possibly alloy formation to occur 
at a significant rate relative to the Mo deposition 
rate. 
A satisfactory interpretation of the surface recon- 
struction and composition changes accompanying 
both growth at elevated temperatures and annealing 
of low-temperature films can be given in terms of 
interdiffusion of Pt and Mo. The phase diagram for 
the Pt/Mo system [10,11] indicates that solution of 
Mo in Pt is thermodynamically favourable and that 
intermediate alloy phases will separate from the ini- 
tial alloy phase if the concentration of Mo in the 
surface region reaches the solubility limit. 
Both thermodynamics and kinetics appear to 
favour alloy formation by diffusion of Mo into Pt 
rather than by outward diffusion of Pt. The lower 
melting point and sublimation energy for Pt indicate 
that diffusion of Mo in Pt should be faster than for Pt 
in Mo and the solubility of Pt in Mo is small at 
temperatures below 1000 K. The structure of the 
surface region during annealing thus seems most 
likely to evolve by the initial formation of Pt-rich 
alloy in which the Mo concentration rises with time 
until all free Mo is removed from the surface by 
diffusion into the Pt. It is noted that Galeotti et al. 
[17] found that Co films were also removed from a 
Pt(lll) surface at temperatures above 900 K by 
solution of Co in the bulk. Since measurable interdif- 
fusion occurs at the Pt/Co interface below 500 K 
[18], it seems reasonable to assume that interdiffu- 
sion at the Pt/Mo interface leads to the surface 
reconstruction observed during growth at 600 K. 
The behaviour observed for Mo films thinner than 
three monolayers indicates that the Mo concentration 
in the Pt surface does not reach the solubility limit, 
which is approximately 20 at% Mo at 800 K. [11] 
The steady decline of Mo concentration and the 
absence of new surface structures in LEED suggest 
that there is no surface segregation of Mo from the 
Pt-rich disordered substitutional solid-solution alloy 
phase, which has the Pt structure. 
For Mo films thicker than three monolayers, es- 
tablishment of a diffusion gradient of Mo in the Pt 
presumably results in the Mo concentration in Pt 
reaching the solubility limit in the surface layer of 
the alloyed region. Nucleation and growth of crystal- 
lites of the intermediate '"rf' phase of composition 
Pt2Mo should then occur. This ordered alloy has a 
body-centred orthorhombic structure with unit cell

129 
dimensions that indicate very little dimensional 
change from bulk Pt [11]. The alloy surface is there- 
fore likely to be the source of the characteristic 
electron reflectivity spectrum and the very sharp 
(v-× f3-)R30 
 LEED pattern, which increases in 
intensity as the crystallites grow. Examining the 
alloy structure shows that the Mo atoms in the 
close-packed (101) plane of the orthorhombic unit 
cell indeed have the correct arrangement to generate 
the observed LEED pattern. It is therefore likely that 
the alloy grows with this plane in registry with the 
Pt(lll) surface as the unit mesh dimensions differ 
by less than one percent. 
Some further evidence that local phase equilib- 
rium was established in the surface region is pro- 
vided by changes in the Pt and Mo Auger signals 
when the annealing sequence was interrupted by a 
lower-temperature anneal. It was found that the Mo 
signal then rose and the Pt signal decreased. This 
result is consistent with the phase diagram, which 
shows that the solubility of Mo in Pt falls as the 
temperature decreases. Some Mo should thus sepa- 
rate from the alloy and an increase in the surface 
concentration would be expected. 
Electron reflectivity and LEED show that the 
ordered structure became the dominant feature of the 
surface during annealing, although it is not possible 
to determine what proportion of the surface it repre- 
sented or the actual surface composition. The whole 
Mo film surface could possibly be Pt rich, because 
surface energy considerations suggest that a Pt-rich 
film would have lower energy than a pure Mo 
surface. The situation would then be similar to that 
for a Pt film on Mo(ll0) for which Linsebigler et al. 
also obtained the v- LEED structure, although they 
ruled out alloy formation on the basis of CO adsorp- 
tion behaviour [12]. To check if the  
structure 
found for Pt on Mo(ll0) is due to formation of the 
same surface phase as found in the present work, we 
carried out a brief study of Pt film growth on a 
Mo(ll0) crystal. The electron reflectance spectrum 
for the v- surface resembled that reported here for 
Mo growth on Pt(lll), which indicates that the 
ordered phase is probably the same. Similarity of the 
surface phases present in the two systems is to be 
expected since it is likely that reconstruction of the 
surface region will occur in both cases by diffusion 
of Mo into Pt, when the temperature is high enough 
for significant bulk diffusion. This would make it 
improbable that unalloyed Pt crystallites could exist 
on the Mo surface. A study of the annealing of Pt 
films on the surface of a Mo field emitter tip shows 
that reconstruction of the film-covered surface actu- 
ally involves nucleation and growth of crystallites of 
a new phase. Examination of the surfaces by field 
ion microscopy confirms that the Mo surface is 
covered by an alloy film [13]. 
The alloy phase on the surface of a Pt crystal is 
metastable with respect to solution of Mo in the Pt 
substrate under annealing conditions. Once the ex- 
cess Mo supply at the surface is removed, continuing 
Mo diffusion into the bulk causes the near-surface 
concentration in the Pt to fall below the solubility 
limit and the alloy phase disappears. LEED then 
shows only the normal Pt(lll)1 × 1 pattern from an 
increasingly Pt-rich disordered solid-solution alloy 
surface. The Mo Auger signal decreases to an unde- 
tectable level with further annealing. 
The precipitation, coarsening and removal of an 
ordered alloy phase raises interesting questions con- 
cerning the distribution of crystallites of Mo, and the 
alloy on the surface. The surface is probably best 
considered as a mosaic of the two types of crystal on 
a disordered alloy substrate. Additional information 
is needed about the distribution and structural rela- 
tionship of alloy crystallites to Mo in the surface 
region. High-resolution electron microscopy proba- 
bly would be the best source but further LEED 
studies appear worthwhile. When a Mo film with 
large ordered domains was obtained, LEED patterns 
showed the usual alloy pattern after annealing but 
contained many extra fractional-order beams, indicat- 
ing that the various phases grow with well-defined 
orientation relationships. 
5. Conclusions 
The restricted mobility of adatoms and small dus- 
ters of Mo on a Mo(ll0) surface at 300 K prevents 
regular layer-by-layer development of Mo films de- 
posited on a Pt(lll) surface. Electron reflectance 
spectra are consistent with the film growing, as 
expected, with Mo(ll0)llPt(lll). 
Deposition of Mo with the Pt substrate at 430 K 
produced a more ordered Mo film but growth at 600

K resulted in a different surface structure, presum- 
ably due to the increasing effects of Pt diffusion. 
The microstructure of the surface region for a 
Mo-covered Pt(lll) surface evolves by diffusion of 
Mo into Pt at temperatures above 700 K and local 
phase equilibrium is approached. 
Annealing deposits of less than three monolayers 
of Mo results in a steady loss of Mo from the surface 
without the separation of new phases. During the 
annealing of thicker films, the Mo concentration in 
the solid-solution alloy formed at the surface by Mo 
diffusion into Pt reaches the solubility limit and the 
orthorhombic ordered alloy phase Pt2Mo separates. 
The ordered alloy is characterised by a distinctive 
electron reflectivity spectrum and a (v- × v-)R30  
LEED pattern, indicating that it grows with the 
close-packed (101) alloy plane parallel to Pt(lll). 
The ordered alloy disappears when continuing diffu- 
sion of Mo into Pt causes the concentration of Mo in 
the solid solution phase to fall below the solubility 
limit.
