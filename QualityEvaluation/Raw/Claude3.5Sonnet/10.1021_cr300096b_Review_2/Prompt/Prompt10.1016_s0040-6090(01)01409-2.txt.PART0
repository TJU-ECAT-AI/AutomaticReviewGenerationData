Abstract
Using Auger electron spectroscopy we demonstrate the determination of the energy barrier for the formation of a surface-
confined Cu Pt (111) bilayer alloy. Starting with one monolayer of Cu on Pt(111) concentration changes are determined as a

1. Introduction
The formation of alloys is an important subject in
material science. Under certain conditions the dissolu-
tion of thin adsorbed films into an underlying single
crystal substrate may be slowed down or even confined
to a thin layer near the surface. The result is called a
surface alloy w1,2x. Due to the technological and scien-
tific interest in their adsorption, reactivity, catalysis and
surface magnetic properties, such surface alloys have
been widely studied w16x. An important parameter for
describing the process of surface alloying is the energy
barrier of interdiffusion. Up to now, most of the quan-
titative investigations of this parameter, however, were
done within the Ficks law approximation w6,7x which
does not take into account a surface-confinement effect,
i.e. the restriction to atomic site exchange within very
few layers near the surface.
In this paper, we report on the determination of the
energy barrier of interlayer site exchange for Cu atoms
on a Pt(111) substrate in the process of formation of a

bilayer-confined CuPt surface alloy. Using Auger elec-
tron spectroscopy (AES) for concentration profile meas-
urements, the energy barrier of Cu-penetration into the
Pt(111) substrate was determined.
2. Experimental details
The experiments were conducted in an ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) chamber with a background pressure of
approximately 3=10
mbar. The residual gas pressure
y10
was measured by an ion gauge and analyzed by a
quadrupole mass spectrometer. The UHV chamber was
equipped with AES, ultraviolet photoelectron spectros-
copy (UPS), a Kelvin probe and low-energy electron
diffraction
(LEED).
The
various
components
are
described in detail elsewhere w8x. Auger electrons were
collected by a Perkin-Elmer cylindrical mirror analyzer
with a capture angle of 42"68 from axis for the entire
3608 around the axis. For the UPS measurements,
photoelectrons were collected by a VG spherical 1508
analyzer with angular resolution of 28 in a 35-mm
distance. The prepared samples were excited with HeI-
radiation incident at a polar angle of 608, while UP
spectra were registered at 08 (normal emission). The
Pt(111) surface was cleaned by repeated Ar
ion

bombardment and annealing cycles, the annealing tem-
perature reaching 1200 K. The sputtering-annealing
cycles were continued until a well-ordered p(1=1)
LEED pattern with bright, sharp spots and a low
background was observed. In order to remove residual
traces of carbon, the sample was heated to 800 K in an
atmosphere of pure oxygen of 2=10
mbar. The
y7
chemical purity of the surface was checked by AES. A
ceramic crucible, resistively heated by a Ta wire, was
used to evaporate the copper. The deposition rate was
approximately 0.05 monolayeryminute (MLymin) as
determined by AES and confirmed by photoelectron
spectroscopy of adsorbed xenon (PAX) and LEED
measurements w9x. The substrate temperature was kept
at 350 K to ensure layer-by-layer growth of the first few
Cu monolayers w10x. The following studies are, however,
restricted to an initial overlayer of just 1 ML of Cu.
3. Results and discussion
Since low-energy Auger electrons are surface sensi-
tive, AES was used to monitor the near surface chemical
compositions as a result of the annealing process. The
intensities of Auger signals vs. annealing temperature
for the 1 ML CuyPt(111) system are shown in Fig. 1.
Each data point was taken after annealing for 1 min at
the respective temperature. For the sake of data com-
parison, successive annealings were done on the same
sample. As can be seen the intensities of the Cu (105
eV) and Pt (237 eV) Auger signals stay constant at
temperatures below 525 K, while above 525 K, the
intensity of the Cu Auger signal decreases and the Pt
signal increases steadily up to 900 K. These results
indicate that the interdiffusion at the CuPt interface
starts at approximately 525 K.
The structure of the valence electron band is sensitive
to the alloy formation w11x. UPS difference spectra
wannealed CuyPt(111) minus as-deposited CuyPt(111)x
from the differently annealed 1 ML Cu films are
summarized in Fig. 2. After annealing for 1 min at the
given temperature and cooling down to near room
temperature, UP spectra were then taken. During the
UPS measurements, no current was applied to the
filament for the sample heating to minimize the effect
of electric field on the low-energy photoelectrons. HeI
resonance radiation with a photon energy of 21.2 eV
was used, and all the UP spectra were detected in
normal emission. The UP spectrum of an as-deposited
1 monolayer Cu film at 350 K is given at the bottom,
i.e. Fig. 2a. This spectrum is characterized by three
peaks P1, P2 and P3 located at binding energies of 1.5,
2.8 and 4.2 eV, respectively. Comparing the positions of
these peaks with literature data, peaks P1 and P3
originate from the Pt substrate while peak P2 corre-
sponds to the Cu 3d states w12,13x. Spectrum 2a is thus
a superposition of the spectra for Cu and Pt. After
annealing the film, there is no change in the spectra up
to 525 K. At temperatures above 525 K, peaks P1, P2,
and P3 decrease as the annealing temperature increases;
instead, two new peaks, P4 and P5, grow. P4 shifts from

the intensities of the Cu (105 eV) Auger signals vs. annealing time

Experimental data show that intensities of Auger signals decrease
monotonously after annealing. The higher the annealing temperature,
a faster attenuation of the intensity is observed. After adjusting the
values of R, the best consistent curves for the experimental data could
be obtained as shown as the solid lines.

1.0 to 0.8 eV while P5 shifts from 2.0 to 2.2 eV in the
annealing process. There is a small peak between the
Fermi level and peak P1 on the freshly deposited
unannealed Cu monolayer film. One possibility may be
that peak P4 is the re-emergence of this peak, i.e. it is
a surface-related Pt peak quenched upon deposition of
the Cu monolayer that re-emerges as Cu is alloyed into
the surface. From the electronic structure of a well-
characterized CuPt alloy single crystal as reported by
Arola et al., Cu d-bands remain distinct in the alloy but
move to a lower binding energy of 0.6 eV compared
with pure Cu w14x. In comparing our UP spectra with
this result, peak P5 could arise from the d-bands of
alloyed Cu while the difference of the binding energies
for peak P2 (for a Cu film) and P5 is 0.6 eV
. Although
the intensities of the Cu (105 eV) Auger signals used
in Fig. 1 correspond to the MMV Auger transition
involving valence states, there is no significant change
in the peak shape as well as the peak position during
the alloy formation because of the large inherent width
of the peak (;7 eV). The corresponding peak shift due
to alloy formation is only a few tenths of an eV w2x.
The use of the intensities of Auger signals to calculate
the surface chemical composition should be adequate in
our case.
The formation of the surface alloy was systematically
studied at various chosen temperatures. Experimental
data points for the intensities of the Cu (105 eV) Auger
signal vs. annealing time at temperatures between 525
and 600 K for an initial coverage of 1 ML Cu on
Pt(111) are plotted in Fig. 3. The intensities of Cu (105
eV) Auger signals decrease faster the higher the anneal-
ing temperature. However, the intensity approaches a
constant value even after a long annealing time at high
temperatures, i.e. 575 and 600 K. The reason is that the
Cu atoms are confined near the surface leading to the
formation of a surface alloy. This result shows that the
interdiffusion behavior of CuyPt(111) is non-classical.
One cannot use the Ficks law approximation to evaluate
the activation energy for the diffusion since the mixing
entropy is no longer the dominant driving force w6,7x.
In this temperature range, no additional LEED spots
were observed. The surface structure remains 1=1.
The Auger signal of Cu in Fig. 3 approaches a
constant value for a long annealing time. The formation
of surface alloy due to the kinetic blocking of the
dissolution has been reported before w2,15x. We used
ion sputtering combined with AES to determine the
concentration depth profile of the 1 ML CuyPt(111)
system. Ar
ions with 1.6 keV kinetic energy and an
q
oblique incident angle were used. The normalized inten-
sities of the Cu (105 eV) Auger signals for the unan-
nealed and the annealed films as a function of the
sputtering time are shown in Fig. 4. For the annealed
film, the thermal treatment was heating the film at 575
K for 40 min. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the normalized
intensity of the Auger signal of the annealed film is
always higher than that of the unannealed film. This
proves that Cu atoms have diffused into the Pt(111)
subsurface during the thermal treatment. In order to
quantify the composition of this system, we use equa-
tions from a sputtering model where preferential sput-
tering is considered. For the unannealed film, Cu atoms
stay at the topmost layer and the intensity of the Cu
Auger signal is proportional to (1yx) (1ye
) after

the Cu atoms is determined to be 0.15 MLymin. The

According to previous results of core-level photoemis-
sion spectroscopy (PES) and low-energy electron dif-
fraction, kinetic blocking occurs during the dissolution
process for the CuPt system and results in the formation
of a Cu Pt
surface alloy w2,15x. We adopt this fact
50

and assume that Cu adatoms stay within the topmost
two layers for the annealed film under the present
conditions.

F is the concentration of Cu atoms at the topmost layer;
and ls0.49 nm is the inelastic mean-free-path of the
Cu Auger electrons of 105 eV kinetic energy, as obtained
from Powell w16x. The preferential sputtering ratio p is
estimated to be 0.5 w17x. A detailed calculation for this
equation is shown in the Appendix A. Setting the value
of F at 0.5, one can obtain the best fit between the
experimental data and the prediction of the equation
describing sputter removal, as shown by the solid line
in Fig. 4. This result shows a good agreement with the
formation of a Cu Pt
surface alloy. The attenuation
50
50
of a higher energy Auger peak of Cu (920 eV) was
confirmed to be in agreement with this composition.
Spectroscopic evidence of the existence of a Cu Pt
50
50
phase, from the dissolution of Cu films in Pt(111), has
been given by PES w2x.
Because of the non-classical dissolution behavior for
CuyPt(111) system, Ficks law approximation is not
valid for evaluating the experimental data point as
shown in Fig. 3. The diffusion barrier for the surface
Cu atoms during surface-alloy formation may instead be
obtained by comparing the data with kinetic Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations. For an fcc lattice, the number
of the interlayer nearest neighbors is three and the
number of the intralayer ones is six. The ratio is 1:2. In
our simulation, the system is simplified and is modeled
as a two-dimensional array of atoms in a square lattice
with the same ratio 1:2, and periodic boundary condi-
tions were applied. Before annealing, Cu atoms stay
only at the topmost layer. The alloy formation of a Cu
Pt surface alloy was simulated as follows. An atom in
the topmost two layers is selected randomly. This select-
ed atom is allowed to diffuse to one of the nearest
neighbor sites with a hopping rate of
.
RsR exp yEykBT

o
where R
is estimated to be kBTyh; and E is the
o
interlayer diffusion barrier of surface atoms during alloy
formation w18,19x. All the movements are limited to the
topmost two layers. Since the intensity of the Auger
signal is attenuated by a factor of e
in the second
ydyl
layer, this causes a decrease of the measured intensity
of Auger signal. Considering this attenuation factor, the
intensity of the Auger signal is calculated after each
atomic hopping event. This process was carried out until
the intensity of the Auger signal reached a saturation
value. In order to improve the statistics, the simulated
intensities of the Auger signals were averaged over 200
simulation cycles.
Adjusting the values of R and following the above
procedure, the curves shown in Fig. 3 could be obtained,
which are in best agreement with the experimental data.
As the annealing time increases, the intensities of the
simulated Cu Auger signals decrease until the mixing is
complete. The simulated Auger intensities are consistent
with those from the experimental observation. In this
way the hopping rate R was obtained for 525, 550, 575
and 600 K. According to Eq. (1), a plot of ln(RyT) vs.
1yT is shown in Fig. 5. From the slope of the straight
line an energy barrier of 1.11"0.12 eVyatom is
obtained for the process of Cu penetration and formation
of a Cu Pt
surface alloy.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have reported on the surface alloy
formation from the 1 ML CuyPt(111) system. Cu
adatoms start to diffuse into the Pt(111) subsurface at
temperatures of approximately 525 K. As concluded
from the depth profile of the annealed 1 ML Cuy
Pt(111) system, an annealing treatment at 575 K causes
a mixture of Cu adatoms with the Pt substrate to form
a Cu Pt
bilayer surface alloy. At higher annealing
50
50
temperatures, a faster mixing is observed. The diffusion
barrier for the surface atoms during alloy formation was
obtained by comparing the experimental data with kinet-
156
J.S. Tsay et al. / Thin Solid Films 397 (2001) 152156
ic MC simulations. The corresponding energy barrier
for the process of forming a bilayer confined surface
alloy is found to be 1.11"0.12 eVyatom. In addition,
UPS was used to monitor the alloy formation from the
1 ML CuyPt(111) system in the annealing process.
