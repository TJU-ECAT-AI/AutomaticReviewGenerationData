I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of spiral CT in the measurement of lung volumes 
Materials and Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers were studied by both spirometer and spiral CT at f 
inspiration and expiration in order to correlate their results, including total lung capacity (TLC) , vital capacity 
(VC) and residual volume (RVl. 3 - D images were reconstructed from spiral CT, and we measured lung 
volumes at a corresponding CT window range ; their volumes were compared with the pmonary function test 
(paired t-test) 
Results: The window range corresponding to TLC was from -1000HU to -150HU (p=O.279, r = O
.986) , and 
for VC from -910HU to -800HU (p=O.366, r=O.954) in ωII - inspiratory CT. The optimal window range for RV in 
full-expiratory CT was from -1000HU to -450HU (p=O.757, r = O.777) , and TLC-VC in full-inspiratory CT was 
also calculated (p=O.843, r = 0.847). 
Conclusion : Spiral CT at f1 inspiration can used to lung volumes such as TLC , VC and RV

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
