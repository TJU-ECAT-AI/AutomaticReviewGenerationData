Abstract 
Ultrathin metal overlayers on W(111) are studied by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation. The 
bimetallic systems are prepared by adsorbing approximately one monolayer of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) at 
100 K. The W 4f7/2 core levels from the W( 111 ) substrate are measured. It is found that the core-level W 4f7/2 binding energy shifts 
originating from W atoms at the interface correlate well with the heats of adsorption for metal films on W(111).  1998 Elsevier

Ultrathin metal films adsorbed on W(111) sur- 
faces have been used as model bimetallic catalysts 
and have been studied extensively using surface 
science techniques in the past several years [1-4]. 
One salient trend emerging from studies of bimetal- 
lic systems is that certain ultrathin metal films 
induce morphological instabilities in the atomically 
rough W(lll) substrate [2]. It is observed that 
the W(111) substrate covered with ultrathin films 
of Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt and Au (as well as O and CI), 
whose Pauling electronegativities are greater than 
2.0, will undergo a structural transition around 
700K, and develop facets consisting of {211}- 
oriented three-sided pyramids. On the other hand,

adsorbed ultrathin films of Co, Ti, Gd, Ni, Cu 
and Ag, whose electronegativities are less than 2.0, 
do not cause such a faceting transition of the 
W(lll) substrate [1,2,4]. This observation sug- 
gests that the electronic structures of the W( 111 )- 
based bimetallic systems play a role in the faceting 
transition. This issue is addressed by means of 
high-resolution soft X-ray photoelectron spectro- 
scopy (SXPS) using synchrotron radiation. 
By tuning the photon energy to select the appro- 
priate kinetic energies of the emitted photon- 
excited electrons (i.e. taking advantage of the short 
inelastic mean free path of electrons in solids), it 
is possible to increase the sensitivity to the near- 
surface region. In a preliminary study of Pd and 
Pt on W(111), it has been demonstrated that the 
W 4f7/2 binding energies measured by SXPS are 
H.-S. Tao et al. / Surface Science 407 (1998) L640-L646 
very sensitive to the surface and interface structures 
[3,4], and that the binding energies of the 
W 4f7/2 core levels originating from W atoms at 
the interface of the bimetallics (i.e. the interfacial 
W4fT/2 binding energies) could be identified. 
Although the measured interfacial W 4fv/2 binding 
energies are rather small (the interfacial W 4fv/2 
binding energy shifts measured with respect to the 
bulk W 4f7/2 are of the order of tens of meV), 
differences in the interfacial W 4fv/2 binding energy 
shifts for different bimetallics are easily measurable 
due to the narrow width of the W 4f7/2 core level. 
In particular, it is observed that the interfacial 
W 4fv/2 binding energies of the Pd- and Pt-covered 
planar W( 111 ) are different from those of Pd- and 
Pt-covered faceted W(211) [3]. 
In order to understand better the electronic 
properties of the bimetallic systems, a systematic 
study of ultrathin metal films of K, Co, Ni, Pd, 
Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) has been carried 
out by SXPS. It is found that a correlation exists 
between the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy and 
the corresponding heat of adsorption of metal 
films on W( 111 ): metal films on W( 111 ) with high 
heats 
of adsorption 
have 
higher 
interfacial 
W4fv/2 binding energies, and metal films on 
W(Ill) with lower heats of adsorption have 
smaller interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energies. A sim- 
ilar correlation is also observed for a few metals 
on W(II0) [5]. There is no clear correlation 
between interfacial W 4fv/z binding energy and 
Pauling electronegativity. This is because the bind- 
ing energy of a given core level is not only deter- 
mined by initial-state effects which are manifested 
by the Pauling electronegativity, but also by final- 
state effects, and the W 4f7/2 core level is known 
to be well screened [6-9]. 
The measurements were performed at beamline 
U4A of the National Synchrotron Light Source, 
which is equipped with a 6 m toroidal grating 
monochromator. The photon energy used in this 
study was 75 eV, with a nominal resolution of 
50 meV. The photoelectrons were collected by a 
VSW 100 mm mean radius hemispherical energy 
analyzer of 5 
 angular resolution in a vacuum 
chamber 
with a 
base 
pressure 
better 
than 
1 x 10-m Torr. The pass energy used in this study 
was 2 eV, which gives a nominal resolution of 
44 meV, and the total instrumental resol .......... 
approximately 65 meV. The temperature was mea- 
sured by W5%Re-W26%Re thermocouple wires 
which were spot-welded to the side of the W( 111 ) 
crystal. The sample was cleaned by cycles of heat- 
ing in 1 x 10 .6 Torr oxygen at  1200 K for 5 min, 
followed by flashing the sample to  2300 K. The 
cleanliness of the sample was checked by photo- 
electron spectroscopy. 
Model 
bimetallic 
systems 
were 
prepared, 
through vapor deposition, by adsorbing a total 
coverage of approximately one physical monolayer 
of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au onto W( 111 ) 
at 100 K (an ideal physical monolayer grows pseu- 
domorphically on W( 111 ) and covers all substrate 
W atoms with a coverage of 1.7 x 1015 atoms cm 
2 
[2,4]). Each metal source (except K, which was 
produced from a getter source; SAES Getters) 
consisted of a metal wire with a nominal purity 
better than 99.99% wrapped around a 0.25 mm 
diameter W wire. Sufficient metal vapor could be 
generated by passing an appropriate current 
directly through the W wire. The surface concen- 
tration of adsorbed metal on W(I 11) was deter- 
mined following the incremental deposition of 
small amounts of metal by means of work-function 
changes and intensities of photoemission features. 
These procedures are discussed in detail elsewhere 
[10]. Each of the metal films studied using low- 
energy electron diffraction was observed to grow 
pseudomorphically on W(lll) [2]. The W 4f7/2 
core-level photoemission spectra were taken imme- 
diately after the deposition of metal films at 100 K. 
No faceting of the W(111 ) substrate takes place 
at this temperature, and the W(lll) substrate 
remains planar [1-4]. 
The W 4fv/2 photoemission at a photon energy 
of 75 eV is very sensitive to the surface region. 
This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 by the W 4f7/2 core- 
level spectrum of clean W( 111 ) measured at 100 K 
at an emission angle of 13 
 from the surface 
normal. In Fig. 1, three W 4f7/2 photoemission 
features are clearly resolved and confirm the more 
recent fitting results [7,8] of previous studies, in 
which only two resolved W 4f 
n features were 
observed experimentally [11]. In these studies, a 
non-linear least-squares fitting was applied to the 
W 4f7/2 photoemission spectrum by assuming that

squares fitting technique, applied to Fig. 1, whose 
details are discussed elsewhere [10], results in three 
distinct W4fT/2 features with physically con- 
strained lineshape parameters. They are assigned 
as the bulk (the feature at the higher binding- 
energy side), the third surface layer (which has a 
core-level shift of -121 meV with respect to the 
bulk W 4f7/2 core level) and the unresolved first 
and second surface layers (the feature at the lower 
binding-energy side which has a core-level shift of 
-446 meV with respect to the bulk W 4f7/2 core 
level). In addition, a small feature with a core- 
level shift of -290 meV with respect to the bulk 
W 4f7/2 core level is attributed to photoemission 
from W atoms at step edges. Due to the shallow

mean free path of emitted photoexcited electrons 
( 5 A for electrons of kinetic energy of 40 eV), 
the combined intensities of the surface W 4f7/2 core 
levels are greater than that of the bulk W 4f7/2 
core level. 
The existence of surface W 4f7/2 core levels 
which are distinct from the bulk W 4f7/2 core level 
for clean W( 111 ) (cf. Fig. 1 
) is a manifestation of 
the vacuum-W(111) interface. As a metal over- 
layer is adsorbed on W( 111 ), the vacuum-W( 111 ) 
interface is replaced by a solid-W( 111 ) interface. 
The 
corresponding 
binding 
energies 
of the 
W 4f7/2 core levels originating from W atoms at 
the solid-W(111) interface assume values which 
are different from those of W atoms at the clean 
W(lll) 
surface, depending on the interactions 
between the adsorbed metal overlayers and the 
W(lll) 
substrate, 
as 
demonstrated 
in 
the 
Ag/W(111) system (cf. Fig. 2). Assuming that all 
H.-S. Tao et al. / Surface Science 407 (1998) L640-L646 
W 4fv/: core levels have the same Doniach-Sunji6 
lineshape [12] (i.e. they are all bulk-like [13] since 
there are no W atoms at the vacuum-solid inter- 
face), a non-linear least-squares fit of the W 4fv/2 
spectrum of Ag/W(111) results in four distinct 
features, as shown in Fig. 2. The feature appearing 
at the highest binding energy is the bulk W 4fv/2 
core level, and the other three features are attrib- 
uted to the interfacial W 4f/2 core levels originat- 
ing from W atoms at the Ag-W(lll) interface. 
Since the Ag film grows pseudomorphically on 
W(lll) at about monolayer coverage [2], there 
should be three inequivalent Ag-W( 111 ) interface 
layers, where the number of nearest Ag atoms to 
W atoms at the Ag-W(111) interface is different 
for each of these Ag-W(ll 1) interface layers. 
From a non-linear least-squares analysis, the 
W4fT/2 core levels originating from the first, 
second, and third Ag-W( 111 ) interface layers have 
different core-level shifts of -382, -263 and 
-132 meV, respectively, with respect to the bulk 
W 4fv/2 core level (cf. Fig. 2). The combined inten- 
sity of the interfacial W 4fv/2 core levels is higher 
than that of the bulk W 4f7/2 core level, which 
illustrates the sensitivity of SXPS to the structure 
of an interface. 
As ultrathin metal films are adsorbed on 
W(lll), 
the W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission 
spectra look distinctly different from clean W(111) 
(cf. Fig. 1 
), and are summarized in Fig. 3. Except 
for K (cf. Fig. 3a), the centroid of the W 4f7/2 core 
level shifts toward the bulk W 4f7/2 core level. In 
particular, the centroid of the W 4f7/2 core levels 
of the d 9 transition metals (cf. Fig. 3b) appear at 
higher binding energies compared with those of 
the noble metals (cf. Fig. 3c). In order to under- 
stand the systematics of the W 4f7/2 spectra shown 
in Fig. 3, it is essential to identify the interfacial 
W 4f7/2 binding energy for each of the bimetallics. 
This is somewhat confusing for Ag/W( 111 ), since 
three interfacial W 4fv/2 core levels may be present, 
apparently due to three geometrically inequivalent 
interface layers. In this case, the geometric mean, 
i.e.  E x I(E) dE/ 
I(E) dE, of these three inter- 
facial features is calculated by excluding the bulk 
W 4fv/2 core level: the calculated quantity is taken 
as the interfacial W4fT/2 binding energy for 
Ag/W( 111 ). A similar procedure is used to extract

Interfacial W 4fa Bndlng Energy (eV) 
Fig. 4. The heats of adsorption of ultrathin metal films on W(111) versus the W 4f7/2 interfacial binding energies. The heats of 
adsorption of metal films on W( 111 ) are obtained, using the Redhead equation [ 15], from the desorption temperature maximum of 
the thermal desorption spectra reported by Guan et al. [2], as well as from Refs. [16-19,30]. 
the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energies for other 
spectra shown in Fig. 3, where separate features 
are closer in binding energy, resulting in a single, 
broad interface peak. Note that in the case where 
the bulk and interface W 4f7/2 core levels almost 
coincide (e.g. Pd, Co, etc.), we subtract a bulk 
W 4f7/2 feature (using the fitting parameters deter- 
mined from the clean surface) having  50% [14] 
of the total intensity before calculating the geomet- 
ric mean. Using this approach, it is found that a 
correlation exists between the interfacial W 4f7/2 
binding energy and the heat of adsorption on 
W(111) for the bimetallics, as shown in Fig. 4. 
The heat of adsorption of each of the metal films 
on W(111) is extracted, using the Redhead equa- 
tion [15], from the desorption temperature maxi- 
mum 
of thermal 
desorption 
spectra (TPD) 
reported by Guan et al. [2] and other sources (Pd 
TPD is obtained from Ref.[16], Pt TPD is 
obtained from a W(211) surface [17], Au TPD is 
obtained from Ref. [18] and the K binding energy 
on W(II1) is obtained from Ref.[19]). In all 
cases, the desorption temperature corresponding 
to a fractional monolayer is used. 
Our observation is that the higher the heat of 
adsorption of the metal film on W( 111 ), the higher 
the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy. On the other 
hand, no clear correlation exists between the 
Pauling 
electronegativity 
and 
the 
interfacial 
W 4f7/2 binding energy. For example, Au and Pt 
have Pauling electronegativities of 2.4 and 2.3, 
respectively, but the interfacial W 4f7/z binding 
energies differ significantly (cf. Fig. 4). Note also 
that in all cases except for K, work functions 
increase as metal overlayers adsorb on W(111), 
but the magnitude of the work-function change 
does not scale with the electronegativity. 
The Pauling electronegativity is a relative mea- 
sure of the initial-state effect contribution to the 
binding energy of the core level in chemical bond 
formation. However, the measured W 4f7/2 binding 
energy is influenced by a combination of initial- 
and final-state effects. Therefore, it is not so sur- 
prising that there is no clear correlation between 
the measured interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy 
and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbed 
metal films, where the final-state contribution to 
the binding energy of the core level is not negligi- 
ble, and depends on the interaction between the 
adsorbed metal film and the W( 111 ) substrate. 
The local density of states (DOS) around the 
W atoms at the interface, which is influenced by 
H.-S. Tao et al. / Surface Science 407 (1998) L640-L646 
the presence of adsorbed metal films, ultimately 
determines the measured interfacial W 4f/2 bind- 
ing energy originating from W atoms in contact 
with the adsorbed metal films at the interface. The 
local DOS also controls the bond strength between 
the adsorbed metal film and the W(111 ) substrate, 
which determines the heat of adsorption measured 
from the thermal desorption spectra. It is in this 
context that a correlation between the interfacial 
W 4f7/2 binding energy and the heat of adsorption 
might be expected. A correlation of this type has 
been observed for a few metal overlayers on close- 
packed W(ll0) [5]. Unfortunately, quantitative 
information about the electronic properties of the 
interface of the W(111 )-based model bimetallics 
(in particular the charge exchange between W 
atoms and the adsorbed metal film) cannot be 
obtained in the core-level photoemission measure- 
ment of the W(I 11) substrate, since changes in
