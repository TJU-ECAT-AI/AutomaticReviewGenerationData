Ethylene hydrogenation on Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface
Abstract
From XPS and LEED studies, a layer-by-layer growth of Pt thin films is indicated up to 8 ML coverage on Ni(1 0 0) surface while a (1×1) structure changes to a disordered structure above 2 ML of Pt film thickness. The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate. This induces weakly adsorbed hydrogen atoms and ethylene molecules and, as a result, the maximum evolution of ethane is observed around 200 K. A wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy is developed for Pt 6 ML film characteristic of bulk Pt electronic states, resulting in a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as on Pt(1 1 1) surface.
1. Introduction
Bimetallic catalysts are often used in industrial reactions in order to improve the activity and/or selectivity. The well-defined single crystal surfaces of binary alloys have been the object of numerous surface science studies investigating the correlation between the atomic level surface structure and the surface chemical reactivity for a better understanding of catalysis by alloys. Among these systems, it has been found that PtNi alloy single crystal surfaces show surface enrichment of one component, depending on the surface orientation; i.e., Pt enrichment at the first layer and Ni enrichment in the second layer for (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, reverse order for (1 1 0) surface

[3]
. For the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloy surface, the outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene
[4]
. This drastic change is interpreted to be associated with the presence of Ni in the sublayer which imposed a contraction of the bond lengths between the surface Pt atoms with alloying, due to the difference between the lattice parameters of Pt (3.924 Å) and Pt0.5Ni0.5 (3.755 Å).
As an alternative approach to better understand the fundamental properties and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic surfaces, a model bimetallic surface can be prepared by depositing Pt atoms onto Ni(1 0 0) surface as a substrate. This is a more direct way to correlate the change in the surface structure and related electronic states with chemical reactivity upon the addition of a second constituent. It is expected that the substrate can set an epitaxial relation to the overlayer which would cause severe strain as similar to the PtNi alloys having higher Ni bulk content, because the Ni substrate has an about 10% shorter lattice parameter than the Pt overlayers. This indicates that a metastable Pt(1 0 0) surface can be produced on the Ni substrate. It is well known that the pure Pt(1 0 0) surface reconstructs to a hexagonal surface layer resembling the structure of the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The influence of the topography of the substrate on the bonding and reactivity has been shown upon the adsorption of ethylene molecule on these surfaces; an ethylidyne intermediate is stabilized on the Pt(1 1 1) and reconstructed Pt(1 0 0) surfaces having the three-fold symmetry adsorption sites whereas a vinylidene is observed on the (1×1) Pt(1 0 0) surface
[5]
,
[6]
. Also, it has been shown that the rate for hydrogenation of ethylene can depend upon the surface orientation, i.e., it can present some sensitivity to the surface structure
[7]
.
In the present study, we have studied the adsorption of ethylene and hydrogen on Pt thin films grown on Ni(1 0 0) substrate in order to explore the relation between surface structure and its related electronic states and chemical reactivity of PtNi alloy in an atomic level.
2. Experimental
The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously
[8]
. The system is equipped with facilities for X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a cap shield for temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and two pulse valves for gas dosing. The system base pressure is 5×108 Pa. MgKα radiation (1253.6 eV) and He discharge lamp (21.2 eV) were used as photon sources for XPS and UPS. Photoelectrons were collected with a hemispherical analyzer. Its energy resolution was around 1 eV (XPS) and 0.5 eV (UPS). Angle-resolved UPS measurements at a given azimuth were accomplished by varying the angle between the sample normal and the detector direction. The angles were measured with respect to the sample normal. TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line of sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 23 K/s. The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or resistively heated to 1200 K. The temperature was measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple spotwelded to the side edge of the crystal.
The Ni(1 0 0) crystal was cleaned by repeated Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 1200 K procedures. Pt was evaporated from a tungsten filament containing a Pt wire by resistive heating on the clean Ni(1 0 0) surface kept at room temperature. Because of the carbon contamination resulting from each adsorption and subsequent TPD experiment, the Pt thin films were used as grown newly prepared for each experiment. Pt was removed by Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 1200 K. The cleanliness was checked by XPS. Research grade reactant gases purchased from Takachiho Co. were used without further purification.
3. Results and discussion
The growth mode of Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface was studied by XPS. The peak intensities of Pt 4f and Ni 2p core level photoelectrons taken at the collection angle of 36 from surface normal direction are shown as a function of deposition time at a constant deposition rate in
Fig. 1
. The intensities were normalized to the sum of these Pt and Ni peak areas in order to minimize the fluctuation during the measurements as shown in
Fig. 2
. The curves exhibit the exponential form for the Pt overlayer as well as the Ni substrate and can be approximated by a series of straight line segments expected for layer-by-layer growth. Assuming the equally separated Pt overlayer and the corrected escape depth in the direction for the analyzer by 1/cos 36, the layer-by-layer model is represented by the solid lines of
Fig. 2
. Reasonable agreement has been obtained in the first two layers of Pt. The deviation from the model is considered to be within an amount of uncertainty in XPS measurement. From these results, the attenuation coefficient of the Ni signal by a monolayer of Pt is found to be 0.64, leading to a mean free path for 400 eV electron of about 2.8 ML, which is a reasonable value compared with those reported in the literature
[9]
. The first two layers showed a (1×1) LEED pattern as dictated by substrate Ni surface, although further deposition of Pt atoms deteriorated the spots due to the (1×1) structure significantly. It indicates that a disordered layer-by-layer growth proceeds above 2 ML thickness.

Both of the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 level
and Ni 2p3/2 level
stay constant independent of Pt thickness except for small initial shift of Ni level to higher binding energy by 0.2 eV. These are in agreement with the values reported in the literature on Pt(1 1 1)
[10]
and Ni(1 0 0)
[11]
. Theoretical calculation for PtNi alloy shows that each atom will have to be more or less neutral in the alloy due to the similarity of the electronegativity of Ni and Pt, and hence it is expected that charge transfer is small
[12]
. The work function has been measured as a function of the Pt thickness by the cut off of secondary emission in He I UP spectra. The results show a constant value of 5.2 eV in the work function for Ni substrate as well as the Pt overlayers in the coverage range of 16 ML investigated. The value for Ni substrate is in good agreement with that in the literature
[13]
while the larger values of 5.96.4 eV are reported on Pt single crystal (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
. This small value (5.2 eV) of the Pt overlayers is, therefore, indicative of the presence of the roughness on the surface, which is also in accordance with the disappearance of LEED pattern above 2 ML thick.
Fig. 3
shows angle-resolved photoemission with He I radiation to follow the change of the electronic structure of the Pt overlayers of 16 ML thicknesses on Ni(1 0 0) at normal emission. The Ni(1 0 0) substrate spectrum displays a peak around 0.8 eV below the Fermi level. The deposition of 1 ML Pt overlayer gives the peak with almost the same binding energy. Up to a Pt thickness of 3 ML a gradual development of a broad structure within 4 eV below the Fermi level. Increasing the film thickness up to 6 ML produced bulk Pt(1 1 1) structures at 1.5, 2.0, 2.6, and 4.2 eV binding energies. It would be expected that a larger dispersion for the Pt derived state is caused by the considerable overlap of the wave functions due to the reduced lattice constant. In order to examine the band dispersion in the surface parallel direction, angle-resolved UPS measurements have been carried out at the [0 1 0] azimuth of the surface as displayed in
Fig. 4
. It is observed that there is no significant difference in the band dispersion along the surface Brillouin zone of Σ line between the 1 ML Pt overlayer and the Ni substrate which lies within 2 eV from the Fermi level. On the other hand, a wide d-band structure extending to 6 eV binding energy characteristic of bulk three-dimensional Pt has developed for the 6 ML Pt films. It is, hence, considered that the Pt atoms in the first monolayer are bonding with the substrate Ni atoms rather than the neighboring Pt atoms. In this respect, this state resembles that observed as an interface state in the system Pt/Co(0 0 0 1) where the interface state has mainly the character of the overlayer (Pt 5d), despite its strong hybridization with the substrate
[17]
. These results strongly suggest that d-band narrowing in the 1 ML Pt overlayer is derived from reduced coordination of the surface Pt atoms and the charge flow upon the bonding to Ni atoms as an interface state. Consequently, the 1 ML Pt overlayer on Ni(1 0 0) surface can be regarded as the topmost two layers of an alloy with composition that is not far from Pt0.5Ni0.5.

When we assume π-coordinated ethylene molecule present on the surface, the highest-occupied 1b2u (π) and the lowest unoccupied 1b3g (π*) molecular orbital should be primarily involved in the interaction with substrate. Since the unoccupied electronic structures in this system cannot be explored in the present study, adsorbate states are only discussed in the former molecular orbital and the electronic states of the Pt overlayer shown above to measure the hybridization of molecular orbital with substrate band structure. Considering the work function of the Pt overlayers, the energy level of molecular ethylene π orbital will be located around 5 eV below the Fermi level. Hence, this π orbital strongly interacts with the bottom of the Pt d-bands for the thicker Pt films as similar to bulk Pt(1 1 1). It is observed that a considerably strong bonding takes place in ethylene/Pt(1 1 1) system
[18]
. However, the d-band narrowing in the 1 ML Pt overlayer should lead to a weak overlap with the adsorbate orbital. These considerations will be exemplified in the TPD experiments shown below.
Before doing the experiment of temperature programmed reaction of ethylene with adsorbed hydrogen, we have measured the adsorption of hydrogen as one of adsorbates for ethylene hydrogenation. The thermal desorption spectra of H2 evolution from the Pt overlayers grown on the Ni(1 0 0) surface after hydrogen dosed below 150 K are summarized in
Fig. 5
. Hydrogen desorption appeared as a main peak at 300 K with a shoulder around 250 K in the TPD spectrum from the clean Ni(1 0 0) surface which is in good agreement with the data published previously
[19]
. Deposition of the first Pt overlayer induced a new desorption state at 190 K which made a broad feature overlapping with a peak around 280 K. Further increase in the thickness of Pt overlayer shifted both of these two desorption states gradually to higher temperatures and decreased the desorption area for the lower temperature state monotonously as shown in the figure. At the Pt thickness of 6 ML the H2 desorption spectrum resembles that on Pt(1 1 1)
[20]
. This weakening of hydrogen-surface bonding at the first layer of Pt is consistent with the chemisorptive properties of the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloys where it has not been possible to detect any adsorption except CO
[21]
,
[22]
. In this respect, the first Pt overlayer represents suitably a model surface of alloys showing particular properties quite different from those of bulk Pt.

.
The hydrogenation of ethylene to form ethane under UHV was also monitored with temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) after saturation of the hydrogen-preadsorbed Pt overlayers with ethylene at 1 0 0 K.
Fig. 6
provides TPR spectra of ethane and ethylene (large circles) evolved simultaneously as a function of the Pt film thickness. As is shown in
Fig. 5
, the H2 desorption in TPRS (small dots) appears at the temperature of the main peak observed in H2 TPD. In contrast, the higher temperature tail of the H2 TPR spectra shifts from 380 K on the 1 ML to 460 K on the 6 ML Pt coverage. The H2 TPR spectrum from the 6 ML Pt film resembles H2 desorption feature from the decomposition of ethylidyne intermediate formed on Pt(1 1 1) surface
[23]
. This change indicates a large increase in the activation energy for the CH bond cleavage involved in the complete dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon species remaining on the surface at high temperatures. It is easy to recognize from
Fig. 5
that the lower desorption state of hydrogen was almost completely suppressed in the figure. It indicates that this hydrogen state is involved in the formation of ethane. It comes out as the ethane peaks as shown in
Fig. 6
. In accordance with the appearance of the lower H2 desorption state, addition of the 1 ML Pt overlayer strongly promotes ethane formation as indicated by the largest peak around 190 K in the TPR spectra. The dramatic effect of further increase of the Pt thickness is a considerable reduction in the amount of ethane formation with a marked increase in the ethane desorption temperature. This significant shift in the desorption temperature obviously exceeds that observed in the H2 TPD spectra in
Fig. 5
but nicely corresponds to the change of the desorption temperature of ethylene during TPR spectra as shown in
Fig. 6
. Finally, for the 6 ML Pt overlayer the TPR spectra of ethylene is dominated by a large peak at 300 K typical for the di-σ bonded ethylene, which evolved only a tiny ethane desorption peak
[24]
,
[25]
. The observed shift in the desorption temperature corresponding to the weakened bonding of ethylene molecule also shows a nice agreement with the chemisorptive properties of the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloys described above. This is entirely originating from the band narrowing of the first Pt overlayer due to the formation of the interface state, which causes the decrease in the mixing of surface electronic density of states in the formation of bonding with adsorbate. It brings about weakly adsorbed ethylene and hydrogen atoms and hence stimulates a significant high reactivity for ethane formation. Thus, this model system demonstrates how the presence of Ni in the surface alloy alters the Pt surface so that the reaction can take place and an electronic effect of Ni must be important in the production of ethane.

This idea is extended to the interaction of ethylene on Pt single crystal surfaces. The adsorption of ethylene as π-bonded state has been reported on (2×1) Pt(1 1 0) and Pt(2 1 0) surfaces, which are very highly stepped
[25]
,
[26]
. It indicates that π-bonded ethylene is favored at the top of the steps on the Pt surfaces. When this weakly bound form of ethylene was co-adsorbed with hydrogen, an ethane peak was observed around 200 K. Therefore, a definitive reason for the formation of ethane from a weakly bound form of ethylene on Pt surfaces with highly stepped is considered to be not only the geometrical surface structure but also the band narrowing of Pt due to the reduced coordination of the surface atoms located at the steps.
4. Summary
XPS and LEED studies indicate that the epitaxial growth of Pt overlayer on Ni(1 0 0) surface is limited up to 2 ML coverage probably by a severe strain as similar to the PtNi alloys arising from the different lattice parameters by about 10%. The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate. This greatly weakens the bonding energy of hydrogen atoms as well as ethylene molecule, thus causing the maximum evolution of ethane around 200 K. In contrast, the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy characteristic of bulk Pt electronic states upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML, leads to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as on Pt(1 1 1) surface. Through the examination of this model system it is evident that a high reactivity for the hydrogenation reactions is originated from the modification of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of alloy.
