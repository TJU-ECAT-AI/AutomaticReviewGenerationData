 Wedetermine here the most stable structures of a Pt deposit onto a Co0001! substrate, in the submonolayer
 range, by means of tight-binding quenched-molecular-dynamics simulations. Our essential result is that Pt/Co
 growth is essentially governed by the strain imposed by the substrate and by the tendency of the adatoms to
 avoid on-top positions. More precisely, whereas in the rst stages of Pt deposition the strong adsorbate
substrate interaction leads to the formation of a high density of strained islands, these islands are able to relax
 before completion of the rst monolayer 0.8 ML!, thanks to the incorporation of Co atoms removed from the
 substrate. This phenomenon can be viewed as a rst step towards the formation of a size-mismatch-induced
 surface alloy, in full agreement with photoemission spectroscopy experiments. @S0163-182999!07527-X#
 I. INTRODUCTION
 The properties of heteroepitaxial systems, among which is
 magnetism, are strongly dependent on the structural and the
 chemical nature of the interface. In most cases, this interface
 is far from being a perfectly at and abrupt one, even in the
 absence of interdiffusion and especially when the two ele
ments deposit, substrate! present a strong size mismatch.
 Generally, simple wetting arguments, based on the difference
 in surface energies between both elements and on their mix
ing ability that drives the interfacial energy, are not sufcient
 to predict the growth modes in the submonolayer range. It is
 then essential to understand and possibly to model how the
 system releases the strain induced by the size mismatch,
 through atomic relaxation and reconstruction of the interface
 as a function of coverage. This is only possible by perform
ing systematic studies for well-dened systems, on both ex
perimental and theoretical sides. Pt/Co is a good candidate
 for such studies since the two elements present a large size
 mismatch 11%!, almost the same surface energy (Dg
 51.8%), and a tendency to chemical order as evidenced by
 the corresponding bulk phase diagram. From an applied
 point of view, this system has been widely studied for its
 magnetic properties.
 Platinum on Co0001! shows a three-dimensional 3D!
 growth mode as evidenced by means of synchrotron-induced
 core-level photoemission spectroscopy and Monte Carlo
 simulations.1 Strained epitaxial layers in a twinned-fcc struc
ture have been observed by means of grazing incidence x-ray
 scattering.2 From the theoretical point of view, developing a
 microscopic model, which should be able at the same time to
 account for strain release, via atomic relaxations and recon
structions, and for possible chemical rearrangements, is nec
essary.
 and substrate atoms that occupy inequivalent positions. This
 can be done in the framework of a quenched-molecular
dynamics simulation, provided one uses many-body poten
tials sufciently realistic to account for surface relaxations.
 The present work is devoted to the equilibrium structure of a
 Pt deposit on Co0001!. The principles of the numerical
 simulations and the derivation of the tight-binding potentials
 are described in Sec. II. The superstructures of Pt deposits on
 Co0001! are presented as a function of coverage in Sec. III.
 They are followed by a discussion and a comparison with
 experiments Sec. IIID!.
 II. THEORETICAL MODEL

 B. Derivation of the interatomic potentials for the Pt-Co
 system
 In the tight-binding formalism,5 the energy of an atom at
 site i is written as the sum of two terms, an attractive band
 energy and a repulsive pair interaction:
 Ei5Ei

 r .
 The band term is obtained by integrating the local density
 of states up to the Fermi level,5 which gives rise to the many
body character of the potentials necessary to account for sur
face relaxations and reconstructions.6 When replacing the re
alistic density of states by a schematic rectangular one

 where pIJ is related to the bulk modulus of the metal.
 For each pure metal species Pt, Co!, the parameters
 (j,A,p,q) are determined by tting the potential to the uni
versal equation of state driving the variation of the potential
 with distance.9,10 This procedure implies that the experimen
tal values of the cohesive energy, lattice parameter, and bulk
 modulus are known. This is the case for Pt and Co.11 To use
 the same cutoff radius for both metals, rc has been xed at
 the second-neighbor distance for the largest atom, i.e., Pt.
 From rc up to the Co-Co! third-neighbor distance, the po
tential is linked up to zero with a fth-order polynomial to
 avoid discontinuities both in the energies and in the forces.
 The cutoff was not extended to the fth neighbors as done in
 Ref. 12 within the same formalism since the computational
 time due to this long-range interaction is too important with
 regard to the small improvement that this could bring. Fitting
 the universal equation leads to the following values of the
 parameters: p511.14, q53.68, A50.242 eV, j52.506 eV
 for Pt and p58.80, q52.96, A50.189 eV, j51.907 eV for
 Co.
 A well-known problem of this tting procedure is that it
 leads to underestimated surface energies, as it can be seen
 from their comparison with the experimental ones:13

 This drawback is not too serious since it has been shown that
 when interested in bimetallic surface problems segregation,
 deposition! the quantity that has to be preserved is not the
 surface energy of each element, but the difference between
 them.14 Here this difference is well reproduced:
 Dgcal50.11 eV/atom, Dgexpt50.15 eV/atom.
 The main requirement for the cross-interaction parameters
 is to properly account for the tendency to bulk ordering, i.e.,
 favoring heteroatomic pairs. This is achieved by tting the
 experimental heats of dissolution of one impurity of Pt in Co
 respectively, Co in Pt!. This can be obtained from the slopes
 of the mixing energies15 in the dilute limits, with Esol
 520.47 eV/atom for Pt Co! and Esol520.65 eV/atom
 for Co Pt!.
 It is worth noticing that, due to the large size mismatch
 between Co and Pt, the whole system matrix1impurity! has
 to be relaxed during the tting procedure. Having only two
 equations for four parameters, only two of them (A and j)
 are left free while p and q are taken as the arithmetic average
 between the pure metal values. Doing this, one nds p

teractions.
 The use of such semiempirical potentials is indeed ap
proximate but gives a reasonable description of the transition
 close-packed metals and particularly allows simulations with
 thousands of atoms. A realistic ab initio calculation in the
 same conditions is out of range of possibilities.
 C. Relative stabilities of the obtained structures
 In order to compare the relative stabilities of the different
 structures an energy criterion is necessary to ascribe the most
 stable structure to the lowest energy. To this aim, when one
 deposits ns Pt atoms onto a Co substrate with Ns atoms per
 plane, corresponding to a coverage u5ns /Ns ML, one de
nes the adsorption energy per Pt atom as follows:16

 where Etot(A/B) is the total energy Co substrate and ns

 The quenching procedure allows one to reach any local
 energetic minimum, but does not guarantee that it is the low
est one. However, it allows one to determine a full energetic

 rameters temperature, coverage!. Therefore, to avoid being
 blocked in one minimum of secondary importance, and to
 reveal the most signicant ones, one has either to perform
 simulated annealings or to start from a sufciently large set
 of initial congurations to explore the whole conguration
 space. The second solution was chosen, and the tight-binding
 QMD TBQMD! simulations were performed starting with
 three different realistic congurations.
 i! A Pt island in registry with the Co substrate, the ns Pt
 atoms being separated by a Co-Co distance contraction!.
 ii! A Pt island in which the ns Pt atoms keep their bulk
 Pt-Pt separation.
 iii! n3n pseudoepitaxial superstructure (n5Ans), where
 the ns Pt atoms are homogeneously distributed upon the sur
face of the Co substrate. In the submonolayer range, congu
rations i! and ii! allow one to describe isolated islands and
 conguration iii! corresponds only to a continuous super
structure. The mist between Co and Pt being Dr/r50.1,
 congurations ii! and iii! are equivalent for u5(9
 39)/(10310)50.81 ML, which corresponds to a pure
 Pt111! plane onto a Co0001! plane, both layers keeping,
 respectively, their bulk distances. To stabilize such a super
structure in a simulation, one has to impose a lateral size
 which is a multiple of 10 since, due to the nite size of the
 simulation boxes, this superstructure is repeated laterally ac
cording periodic conditions. Perpendicularly to the surface,
 no periodic conditions are applied so that one deals with a
 slab thick enough typically 10 atomic layers! to recover the
 bulk properties in the midlayer.17 To accommodate the size
 mismatch, one has to use boxes containing N Co atoms and
 n5N1Dn Pt atoms along the dense 110& rows with
 N5 Dn
 r*21 ,
 9!
 where the ratio of Co to Pt atomic radii r*50.902. The rst
 two solutions, corresponding, respectively, to Dn521 one
 row removed! and Dn522 two rows removed!, lead to
 values of N either between 10 and 11, or between 20 and 21.
 Changing the coverage and/or the compactness of the Pt de
posit corresponds to a variation of Dn. Figure 1 shows an
 overview of the variation of the adsorption energy per Pt
 atom obtained as a function of the coverage in the range
 0.01.0 ML for a simulation cell containing 20 Co atoms
 along 110&. We had to change the size cell only in the case
 of conguration iii! in order to vary more nely the com
pactness of the Pt layer for coverages around 0.81 ML.
 For each point of these curves, it has been possible to
 derive the function that gives the distribution of distances
 around one atom after relaxation of the structures, and then
 by averaging on all sites to derive the mean shortest distance
 between the Pt atoms. The variation of this Pt-Pt shortest
 distance with coverage is plotted in Fig. 2. Note that one has
 also access to the Co-Pt shortest distance at the interface, but
 it does not vary in a noticeable way around 2.59 Å for all the
 investigated structures and coverages. This indicates a verti
cal inwards relaxation of about 2% with respect to a hard
sphere stacking using the bulk neighbor distances.
 The minimal energy Eads525.94 eV/atom is obtained
 for a pseudoepitaxial layer with a (12312) periodicity at u
 50.84 ML. With an average lateral contraction of 1.5%, this

 superstructure is found slightly more close packed than a Pt
 bulk 111! plane. This means that the completion of the rst
 monolayer as dened earlier, which would correspond to the
 rst break point in the Auger spectrum, is achieved for u
 50.84 ML. Then, by continuing to add atoms in the rst
 layer beyond 0.84 ML, the structure becomes more and more
 compressed and the corresponding adsorption energy in
creases rapidly, up to a dramatically high energy for u51.0
 ML: Eads(1.0 ML)525.37 eV/atom out of the gure
 scale!. A coherent epitaxy is highly unfavorable and the sec
ond layer should start growing beyond 0.84 ML. When going
 to lower coverages, both initial congurations i! and ii!

 lead to higher energies. Even though the energy curves ob
tained in both cases present a similar behavior and are close
 together, the corresponding distances appear as rather differ
ent, depending on the initial conguration. More precisely,
 the average shortest distance remains smaller when starting
 from the Co-Co bulk conguration @conguration i!# than
 from the Pt-Pt one @congurations ii! and iii! around 0.8
 ML#. In fact, it seems that the two initial structures tend to
 relax towards a unique stable structure, but are blocked'' in
 some intermediate local minimum, very close to the lowest
 one. Anyway, this average relaxed distance is always around
 2.7 Å, i.e., signicantly larger than the Co-Co distance 2.5
 Å! and close to the Pt-Pt one 2.77 Å!. Below 0.84 ML, the
 deposit should be constituted of islands reconstructed ac
cording to the (12312) optimal superstructure, which
 should then appear well below the critical coverage of 0.84
 ML. Therefore, the increase of the energy when u decreases
 is probably due to an edge effect related to the increasing
 proportion of edge atoms when the coverage decreases. Due
 to the nite size of the simulation cells, decreasing the cov
erage corresponds to the simulation of a smaller and smaller
 two-dimensional 2D! island with, therefore, a higher and
 higher proportion of edge atoms. As a given coverage can be
 either realized by a few large islands or many small ones, a
 systematic study separating the variation of cluster size and
 cluster density is hardly feasible with the QMD method and
 is not presented in this work. It should be done together with
 simulations of the growth kinetics, e.g., using the kinetic
 Monte Carlo method.
 After this rst rough analysis, the only way to go further
 in the description of the relaxed structures and to precisely
 give the distance distribution corresponding to the stablest
 structure one must detail the corresponding atomic positions
 of the Pt atoms with respect to the underlying Co atoms, in
 the three coverage regions described above: before, at, and
 after completion of the rst monolayer i.e., on both sides of
 u50.84 ML!.
 A. Submonolayer range: u<0.75 ML
 When submitted to the relaxation process, the Pt adatoms
 move individually in order to satisfy contradictory criteria.
 Unfavorable positions such as a Pt atom on top of a Co atom
 should be avoided. The Pt atoms want to keep in registry
 with the substrate to optimize the Co-Pt interaction, but at
 the risk of a strong compressive stress in the Pt overlayer. On
 the other hand, the same Pt lattice should try to recover the
 bulk interatomic distances to release this compression. The
 relaxed structures can be viewed as the best way to accom
modate these competing requirements. This is illustrated
 here in the particular case of u50.64 ML, in Fig. 3.
 When starting with an island in coherent epitaxy @congu
ration i!: upper panel#, all the Pt adatoms occupy equivalent
 hcp ternary sites with respect to the substrate. Owing to the
 space left free around the island, the Pt lattice is able to
 expand under relaxation in order to release the strain induced
 by this highly symmetrical but very compressed initial con
guration. However, as previously mentioned see Fig. 2!,
 the Pt atoms never recover their bulk interatomic distance
 but keep an average in-plane relaxation of 22.8%, which
 can be explained as follows. Trying to recover exactly the

 bulk separation would lead the Pt adatoms to occupy all the
 possible inequivalent positions with respect to the Co atoms,
 including the most unfavorable on-top ones. Stopping the
 expansion before reaching this state can then be viewed as a
 possible way to avoid these latter sites. The corresponding
 adsorption energy is Eads525.878 eV/atom. On the con
trary, when starting from an unstrained island Fig. 3, lower
 panel! already presenting the bulk Pt lattice parameter, the
 situation is somewhat different since some Pt adatoms ini
tially occupy such on-top sites. Therefore, under relaxation,
 these Pt atoms try to move away from these unfavorable
 sites, leading to an average in-plane relaxation of
 21.5%, but remain trapped close to them, due to the dif
culty to perform some more collective displacements. As a
 consequence, the corresponding adsorption energy is found
 somewhat higher (Eads525.847 eV/atom) than in the case
 of initially more close-packed islands. Anyway, both struc
tures are very similar and can be viewed as slightly con
tracted between 1.5% and 2.8%) two-dimensional Pt is
lands. This analysis still holds in the whole coverage region
 investigated from 0.0 to 0.75 ML!, for which the deposit
 should then be constituted of slightly constrained Pt islands,
 resulting from the strong deposit-substrate interaction which
 allows, at least in the rst stages of the growth, to avoid
 on-top positions. In fact, as can be guessed from Fig. 3, the
 distribution of the interatomic distances is not homogeneous.
 The islands obtained from the congurations i! have the
 distribution shown on Fig. 4. It is centered around the mean
 value of 2.697 Å. The peak at 2.61 Å @also observed for the
 islands from congurations ii!# is due to a more pronounced
 contraction at the islands edges. Such an edge relaxation,

 usually observed in small metal clusters, originates from an
 inwards relaxation occuring at the surface of these clusters
 similar to the known relaxation of the extended metallic
 surfaces.18 This effect adds to the previous arguments in fa
vor of the formation of slightly contracted Pt islands in the
 rst stages of the growth.
 B. Completion of the rst monolayer: 0.75<u<0.85 ML
 When approaching the completion of the rst layer the
 situation becomes more intricate since the on-top positions
 can no longer be avoided just by reducing the mean inter
atomic distance. The curves for congurations ii! have to be
 terminated at the limit coverage of 0.81 ML since it is not
 possible to build bulklike Pt islands beyond. Up to this limit,
 the energy decreases monotonically with increasing coverage
 to reach its minimum value, Eads525.92 eV/atom at 0.81
 ML. The curves for congurations i! and iii! do not present
 such a limitation so that they can be drawn in the whole
 coverage range under analysis. Both present a pronounced
 minimum around 0.81 ML. For congurations iii!, the initial
 pseudoepitaxial Pt layer is signicantly expanded with re
gard to bulk Pt below 0.81 ML. In that case, the main effect
 of relaxation is to introduce discontinuities in this layer,
 leading to the formation of a network of identical islands due
 to the lateral Pt-Pt interactions which force the adatoms to
 come closer one with the other. The appearance of several
 islands per simulation cell strongly increases the proportion
 of edge atoms, leading to a very high adsorption energy
 which makes the corresponding structures highly unstable.
 Therefore, as can be seen on the curve of Fig. 1, relaxed
 structures derived from iii! initial congurations are only
 competing with the others close to the 0.81 ML coverage, for
 which they optimize the adsorption energy as soon as the
 edge effect disappears!. The corresponding superstructure is
 illustrated in Fig. 5. At 0.81 ML, the relaxation does not lead
 anymore to the formation of islands and the Pt initial lattice
 is in the main conserved. As for the ii! case which is com
pletely equivalent at this coverage! no contraction at all is

 observed, contrary to what occurs starting with conguration
 i!, due once again to the difference between a continuous
 layer and an islandlike deposit structure. In fact, as can be
 seen from the quasiholes surrounding the Pt on-top positions,
 it seems that the Pt layer is still not close packed enough. By
 increasing the coverage a little bit more, one nds that the
 minimum adsorption energy is reached for u50.84 ML, cor
responding to a (12312) superstructure which presents an
 in-plane contraction of 1.5% with respect to bulk Pt. Then
 beyond 0.84 ML the too strong compression leads to higher
 adsorption energies, in both the i! and iii! cases, even
 though the latter curve remains slightly lower than the
 former, probably due to the absence of the edge effect. How
ever, at 0.84 ML, no signicant change can be viewed in the
 structure of the relaxed overlayer compared to that obtained
 at 0.81 ML and presented in Fig. 5. Indeed, one still observes
 a local motion of the Pt atoms trying to move away from
 on-top positions. This feature seems to indicate that even
 though the energy curve shows a minimum at u50.84 ML, it
 is perhaps possible to get a better structure by nding some
 way to allow Pt adatoms to avoid this unfavorable site, other
 than by keeping the highly unstable positions in registry with
 the Co lattice. Actually, a close inspection of the prole view
 of a relaxed Pt islandlike deposit initially in registry with Co
 will give some indication of a possible way to reach this
 goal. This view is represented in Fig. 6 for u50.81 ML. The
 Pt adlayer is rather compressed, since the shortest lateral
 distance is RPt
 052.67 Å. It induces a strong corrugation that
 the system tries to release by removing a few Co atoms
 about 5%! from the rst substrate underlayer up to the edge
 of the strained Pt islandlike deposit. A detailed analysis of
 the results shows that such a Co-Pt mixing occurs in the
 simulations as soon as the critical coverage of u*50.76 ML
 is reached. However, this effect only appears when there is
 enough space around the simulated islandlike deposit, which
 requires sufciently large simulation cells to allow large
 enough absolute value of Dn. So, for the cells with 10 Co
 atoms along 110& this phenomenon never appeared. The
 creation of Co vacancies in the rst underlayer can be related
 to STM observations made on two other systems presenting
 a similar size mismatch between deposited and substrate at
oms, namely, Au/Ni111! Ref. 19! and Ag/Cu111!.20 In
 both cases, a triangular-shaped periodic corrugation of the
 adlayer was attributed to the existence of an ordered array of
 dislocation loops in the substrate, corresponding to local fcc/
 hcp stacking faults that allow one to avoid the on-top posi
tions. These conclusions were supported by atomistic simu

 lations performed, respectively, within the effective-medium
 theory for Au/Ni111! Ref. 19! and the tight-binding for
malism for Ag/Cu111!.20 A main difference between both
 systems was that the removed Ni atoms were incorporated in
 the Au adlayer but not the Cu atoms in the Ag one. The
 simulations suggest that our case is more similar to the
 Au/Ni one, with the additional information that this mixing
 should occur preferentially at the edges of Pt islands. This
 enhanced surface mixing can be understood as resulting from
 the tendency to favor heteroatomic pairs instead of homo
atomic ones in the bulk Pt-Co system and the possibility to
 release the strain energy associated to the existence of on-top
 sites by the creation of a hcp/fcc stacking fault in the rst
 substrate layer. In order to help the relaxation process to
 better optimize the Co atom removal, a series of simulations
 has been performed in which we started from the continuous
 superstructures iii!, in which we have incorporated a vari
able number of Co atoms removed from the substrate rst
 layer. The choice of the Co atoms to be removed was made
 in order to allow the Pt atoms initially located in on-top
 positions to relax more easily towards ternary ones. The
 number of Pt atoms in the layer i.e., the coverage! was
 varied by using unit cells of Co such as 20<N<30 and
 Dn522. When starting with the (12312) superstructure,
 four rows of six Co atoms were removed from the substrate,
 creating 5% vacancies in the underlying Co plane as sug
gested by the ejections observed during our rst simulations
 see the upper part of Fig. 6!. These vacancy rows allowed
 one to shift four triangles of 15 Co atoms from a hcp toward
 a fcc stacking, forming a substrate partial dislocation loop. In
 order to create this hcp/fcc stacking fault in the rst layer of
 the initially hcp Co crystal the orientation of the loops has to
 be up. On the contrary, in the cases of Ni and Cu fcc sub
strates the orientation of the observed loops was down since
 the stacking fault has occurred in the direction fcc towards
 hcp.
 The removed Co atoms were then incorporated in the Pt
 overlayer. Under relaxation the interface rearranged itself in
 order to give the relaxed structure shown in the lower part of

 Fig. 6 and which can be viewed as a rst step towards a
 surface alloy formation. Note that this case corresponds to a
 slight decrease of the coverage: u50.80 ML instead of u
 50.81 ML. The corresponding adsorption energy is then
 clearly improved. In Fig. 6 Co atoms are alloyed in the Pt
 overlayer with a maximum of heteroatomic bonds aCo

 corresponds to the lowest energy cost to incorporate the Co
 atoms into the Pt deposit. In Fig. 7 are reported the adsorp
tion energy values obtained in the coverage range 0.760.85
 ML. The minimal energy Eads525.990 eV/atom, found for
 the optimal coverage of 0.80 ML, corresponds to an optimal
 proportion of 5% alloyed Co atoms. The mean lateral lattice
 parameter is then RPt
 052.73 Å.
 C. Beyond the completion: 0.85<u<1.00 ML
 Starting from an initial coherent epitaxy at u51.00 ML,
 the TBQMD relaxation does not allow the system to leave
 this highly symmetrical conguration. The associated ad
sorption energy is therefore very high: Eads(1.00 ML)5
 25.37 eV/atom. In order to break the symmetry of the co
herent epitaxy, a simulated annealing of this conguration
 was performed. An initial temperature of T5500 K is suf
cient to eject atoms from the compact Pt layer, allowing the
 Pt lattice to expand up to 2.74 Å!. This ejection mechanism,
 known as the size-mismatch-induced limited ejections
 SMILE! effect,21 allows one to strongly lower the nal ad
sorption energy (Eads525.82 eV/atom), but not suf
ciently to reach the minimum region. Already from u
 50.90 ML, some Pt atoms are ejected on top of the rst Pt
 adlayer due to the SMILE effect, which allows to dene a
 limiting value for the lateral contraction supported by the Pt
 lattice: R0
 limit(Pt-Pt)52.67 Å.
 D. Discussion and comparison with the experiments

 tensively investigated using a large panel of surface tech
niques. The crystallographic structure of the Pt layers was
 resolved by mean of grazing incidence x-ray scattering
 GIXS!.2 Actually, the knowledge of the lattice parameter, as
 well as its evolution versus the coverage, can be viewed as a
 signicant signature of the strain induced by the growth of
 mismatched lms. Experimentally, the Pt lms are found
 in-plane strained up to 2.0 ML, with a constant average lat
tice parameter of 2.63260.001 Å reecting a strong deposit
substrate interaction above 2.0 ML, the lattice parameter
 steadily increases up to 2.71960.001 Å at 10 ML!.
 These results are consistent with the TBQMD simulations
 which predict an average lateral lattice parameter of 2.67 Å
 when 2D islands are simulated in the submonolayer cover
age. Note that the experimental and theoretical results could
 not directly be compared since the experimentally Pt thick
ness was estimated from the intensity attenuation of the Au
ger Co MVV peak assuming a layer-by-layer growth mode.
 Because of the 3D growth mode of Pt/Co0001!, the experi
mental coverage is overestimated with respect to the one
 used in the simulations. Thus, it is reasonable to think that
 the completion of the rst layer occurs for an experimentally
 estimated Pt thickness of about 2 ML, consistent with the 3D
 growth mode of Pt on Co0001!. The slight discrepancy
 which appears between the theoretical and experimental lat
tice parameters could be due to several factors. One of the
 most important is without any doubt the possibility of a
 nucleation of platinum islands at cobalt edges, a situation not
 included in the calculations. In this case, an additional strain
 is imposed to the platinum atoms, which can probably con
tribute to the decrease of the lattice parameter. Nevertheless,
 in the light of the simulations, we can say that the formation
 of a high density of small strained islands, deduced from the
 experiments, can be viewed as the way with the lowest en
ergy cost to avoid on-top positions.
 The chemical structure of the interface was investigated
 by means of synchrotron-induced core-level photoemission
 spectroscopy1 on the Pt 4f7/2 line. Using Monte Carlo simu
lations in order to reproduce the experimental intensities of
 the Pt 4f7/2 photoemission line versus Pt thickness, evidence
 was found that small islands yielding a high nucleation den
sity grow on top of the substrate, conrming previous Auger
 electron spectroscopy AES! results.22 In addition, this study
 highlighted the existence of an elementary photoemission
 line characteristic of platinum atoms embedded in a cobalt
rich environment. This elementary photoemission line ap
pears for a platinum thickness comprised between 2.0 and
 3.0 ML and coexists with the pure platinum elementary pho
toemission line. Thanks to the TBQMD simulations, we pro
pose elements in favor of an enhanced Pt-Co mixing in the Pt
 overlayer, which should occur preferentially at the edges of
 the islands, as shown by the removal of the Co atoms from
 the substrate towards the deposit evidenced by the
 molecular-dynamics calculations. When the island size in
creases, while keeping Pt-Pt interatomic distances signi
cantly larger than the Co-Co ones, the interface energy also
 strongly increases due to the arrival of some Pt atoms in
 on-top positions. The easiest way to avoid such unfavorable
 positions is to remove some Co atoms from the substrate and
 to incorporate them in the rst Pt layer. This effect is in
creased by the twinned-fcc structure of the Pt lm.2 Indeed
 not only does this structure allow one to form a natural space
 between the islands with a different orientation space which
 is necessary in order that the effect appearssee Sec. IIIB!
 but also it involves an area between islands, very unstable
 from an energetic point of view because of the structural
 uncompatibility between the ABC and ACB stackings. Such
 a surface enhanced mixing, which is a rst step towards the
 formation of a surface alloy, is preferred to a simpler super
structure, due to the tendency of this system to favor the
 formation of heteroatomic bonds and to the very weak hcp/
 fcc stacking fault energy in Co.23
 IV. CONCLUSION
 Putting together the simulations and the various experi
mental results, we can derive the following outline for the
 rst stages of Pt deposition on Co0001!. In the earliest
 stages of the deposition the strong interaction adsorbate
substrate leads to the formation of strained islands. In that
 case, the growth of a high density of small contracted islands
 is probably the best way for the Pt adatoms to avoid on-top
 positions, while keeping interatomic distances signicantly
 larger than the Co-Co ones. Here, more than the usual wet
ting criterion generally used to describe the growth modes
 which involves differences in surface energies which are
 almost negligible here!, the structural strain imposed by the
 substrate and the tendency of the adatoms to avoid the most
 unfavorable positions govern the whole process. Then, when
 the islands extend themselves, avoiding these positions while
 keeping bulklike Pt-Pt distances becomes only possible by
 removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer.
 This can be viewed as a rst step towards the formation of a
 size-mismatch-induced surface alloy with a characteristic
 coverage of u50.80 ML and an optimal concentration of Co
 atoms in the surface alloy of 5%. In this condition the Pt
 lattice is able to release more easily, the lateral shortest in
teratomic distance being RPt
 0 52.73 Å. It would now be in
teresting to check experimentally this surface alloy formation
 by STM as it was done to evidence the correlated dislocation
 loops in the substrate for Au/Ni and Ag/Cu. At the moment,
 this is hindered by the difculty in preparing Co surfaces
 exhibiting only hcp0001! domains. However, the recent re
sults obtained by GIXS on Pt/Co0001! prove the possibility
 of obtaining high quality Co surfaces and are therefore en
couraging further STM studies of heteroepitaxial growth on
 a Co substrate, as conrmed by a rst STM study of the early
 stages of growth of Cu/Co0001!.24 On the theoretical side,
 the next step should now be to increase the thickness of the
 deposit and to study the reversed case Co/Pt! in order to
 better characterize the inuence of the size mismatch on the
 structure of the deposited lm. Some work is in progress in
 these two directions.
