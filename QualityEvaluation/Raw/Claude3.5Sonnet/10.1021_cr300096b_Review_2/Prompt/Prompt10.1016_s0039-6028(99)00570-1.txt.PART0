Faceting induced by ultrathin metal films: structure, electronic properties and reactivity
Abstract
When faceting occurs, an initially planar surface converts to a hill-and-valley structure, typically exposing low-Miller-index crystal faces of microscopic dimensions. The bcc W(111) and Mo(111) surfaces are morphologically unstable when covered by monolayer films of certain metals (including Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt, Au), and they become nanotextured upon annealing at T>700 K: the surface is covered by nanoscale three-sided pyramids with mainly {211} facets. In the present work, we focus on the structure, electronic properties and reactivity of planar and faceted W(111) and W(211) covered by ultrathin films of metals (mainly Pd, Rh, Pt, Au) and non-metals (S, O). The measurements include ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy, soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS) using synchrotron radiation, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, low-energy electron microscopy, and thermal desorption spectroscopy. The metal film growth and thermal stability have been investigated for coverages of 08 ML. The observed formation of three-sided pyramids with both {110} and {211} facets, as induced by 1 ML of overlayer metal, is predicted also by recent first-principles calculations of surface energetics. The faceting is caused by an increased anisotropy in surface free energy that occurs for the film-covered surfaces. At coverages above 1 ML, SXPS data indicate that thin film alloys are formed upon annealing films of Pt and Pd; surface alloy formation is not seen for Au films. These findings are discussed in terms of structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems. The relevance to catalytic properties of a structure-sensitive reaction (acetylene cyclization over PdW) is also discussed.
1. Introduction
The faceting of metallic bcc (111) surfaces covered with certain adsorbed gases has been recognized for many years
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
, and more recent evidence has been found for faceting induced by ultrathin metal films
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. In contrast to atomically smooth, close-packed substrates that comprise the majority of published studies on model thin film metal-on-metal systems
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]

[13]
,
[14]
, bcc (111) substrates represent atomically rough, morphologically unstable surfaces.
An overview of faceting induced by ultrathin metal films is given in Ref.
[4]
. In brief, W(111) and Mo(111) coated with a single physical monolayer (ML) of certain metals or other elements (Pd, Rh, Ir, Pt, Au, O) undergo massive reconstruction from a planar morphology to a microscopically faceted surface upon heating to T>700 K
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. Three-sided nanometer-sized pyramids form, in which the sides are mainly film-covered {211} facets. The faceting transition in these systems is believed to be thermodynamically driven but kinetically limited: annealing is needed to achieve sufficient surface atom mobility for mass transport. Film-covered surfaces increase the anisotropy in surface free-energy and enhance the relative stability of the faceted morphology
[4]
. Striking evidence for structure sensitivity in a catalytic reaction, butane hydrogenolysis, has been found for planar and faceted PtW
[15]
.
In the present paper, we summarize recent results that provide new insights into the morphological stability of film-covered W surfaces. We focus on three main aspects of the studies: surface structure and morphology, surface chemistry, and surface electronic properties. We begin with atomically-resolved STM studies of Pd-covered W(211) facets that form upon annealing PdW(111). We then discuss recent first principles calculations that predict faceting. We also compare the {211} facets with experiments on planar (211) surfaces, and with field emission microscopy (FEM) investigations of faceting of curved microcrystals. After discussing the remarkable reconstructions induced by sulfur on W(111), we describe the surface chemistry of a structure-sensitive reaction, acetylene cyclization to benzene. We close with new studies of surface electronic properties using synchrotron radiation; these measurements shed light on the role of surface alloy formation in bimetallic systems.
This activity represents the first detailed microscopic studies of faceting of metal substrates induced by monolayer overlayer films. We believe these results are important in understanding the mechanisms of possible dynamic structural rearrangements at the surfaces of high area bimetallic catalysts under high temperature operation. Moreover, there are other implications for metal-induced faceting of W, in areas as diverse as the thermal stability of metallic vias and interconnects in microelectronics fabrication (where W is widely used) to the possible self-assembly of field-emitter arrays for flat-panel displays.
2. Experimental procedures
The measurements have been made in several ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers, all of which have been described previously.
The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) chamber contains a McAllister UHV scanning tunneling microscopy, rear view low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled metal evaporator for deposition of metals onto the W samples. Procedures are described in Ref.
[16]
.
The LEED/Auger/reaction chamber
[6]
,
[15]
contains a double pass CMA for AES, four-grid LEED optics, quadrupole mass spectrometer, metal evaporators, gas dosing capabilities, and a high pressure reactor chamber. A notable feature is the capability of performing temperature programmed desorption (TPD) at temperatures up to 2400 K, to characterize desorption of metals
[17]
.
The soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS) chamber at beamline U4A of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) contains a VSW 100 mm radius hemispherical analyzer, metal evaporators, etc.
[18]
. Total instrumental resolution (analyzer+monochromator) is 65 meV at a photon energy of 75 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Faceting and reconstruction induced by overlayer films
3.1.1. Faceting induced by ultrathin metal films on W(111): experiment and theory
In this section we discuss the STM evidence for Pd-induced faceting of W(111), the results of recent calculations that provide evidence that faceting is thermodynamically driven and kinetically controlled, and new results concerning the dynamics of faceting in the PtW(111) system.
Direct evidence for complete faceting of the PdW(111) surface
[16]
is shown in a large-area STM image (1000×1000 Å2) in
Fig. 1
: after depositing 1.2 ML of Pd overlayer onto W(111) and annealing at 1075 K for 3 min, the entire surface is covered by pyramids and pits, the sides of which consist of {211} facets. Pyramids and pits share common facet planes. [N.B.: one physical monolayer (ML) of Pd on W(111) covers all exposed W atoms and corresponds to 1.73×1015 atoms/cm2].
Fig. 2
is an atomic-resolution image of faceted structures in the PdW(111) system. For a Pd coverage of 1.5 ML, annealing at 1075 K brings the surface to a completely faceted condition. The most remarkable features in this image are the atomic row-and-trough structures on individual facets, consistent with their {211} orientation identified by LEED
[16]
. The blurred features are identified as disordered Pd overlayers with local Pd coverage >1 ML. LEED indicates a (1×1) structure for Pd on faceted {211} surfaces, implying a pseudomorphic overlayer of Pd with a coverage of one physical ML. We can determine the facet size distribution directly from the STM images by use of an image-analysis algorithm developed in our laboratory especially for this purpose

[16]
.
When the initial coverage of Pd exceeds the critical value (1 ML) needed for inducing faceting, the extra Pd is observed to agglomerate upon annealing. Depending on the annealing time and temperature, the dominant features formed by the extra Pd can range from locally disordered patches (see
Fig. 2
), to large clusters sitting on the fully faceted surface
[16]
. The large clusters appear crystalline with distinct faces. As discussed in
Section 3.3.2
, we believe that the clusters are composed of a PdW alloy.
An intriguing aspect of the experimental results is that the dominant facet orientation is {211} rather than the close-packed {011}, which is expected to be the most energetically stable surface in bcc metals. This fact is attributed primarily to the different changes in total surface area that occur for the formation of facets with different orientations. There is only an 6% increase of the total surface area during {211} faceting on a bcc(111) surface in contrast to 22% for {011} faceting. Consequently, {211} faceting may be more favorable energetically as a result of a greater reduction of the total surface energy. Nevertheless, the formation of {011} facets on the PdW(111) can occur under certain conditions: prolonged annealing of PdW(111) can cause the formation of pyramidal Pd-covered {011} facets that exist together with pyramidal {211} facets
[20]
.
Fig. 3
shows an STM image that illustrates this coexistence phenomenon. There are two different types of facet, each of which consists of three-sided pyramids with opposite orientations. The larger pyramids (apexes pointed down) have {211} facets, whereas the smaller pyramids (apexes pointed up) have {110} facets. Evidence for the identification of the {110} facets is based on the surface atomic arrangement, the atomic spacing, and the relative slopes of the {211} and {110} facets

Two types of three-sided pyramid form upon annealing for 6 min. Atomic-resolution images (not shown here) identify the large facets as {211}, and the atomic structures on tiny facets are quantitatively consistent with {011}. (b) Top view of a hard-sphere model showing the atomic structures of a pyramid with {011} facets and a pyramid with {211} facets on a bcc(111) surface. The indicated value of the atomic spacing corresponds to a bulk truncation structure of W(111), containing a pseudomorphic Pd overlayer
[20]
.
First-principles calculations (local density formalism with generalized gradient approximation, LDA-GGA) have been used to show that the coexistence of two types of pyramidal facet is consistent with energetic considerations
[20]

is a plot of scaled surface formation energies σ per surface unit cell for Pd on W(111) (triangles), W(110) (squares) and W(211) (circles) as a function of Pd coverage expressed as the number of physical monolayers. The surface formation energies for σ110and σ112 have been weighted by geometrical factors of 3 and 1.5 respectively for direct comparison of the energy change during the faceting transformations. The fact that the (211) and (110) values are both lower than the (111) value at 1 ML Pd implies that the {211} and {110} facets are both thermodynamically allowed, but that {211} is more stable than {110}.

[20]
.
Che et al. have performed other first principles calculations
[21]
that address the materials specificity of faceting by ultrathin films. They studied various metals grown on an Mo(111) substrate, and calculated the surface formation energies for film-covered Mo(111) and (211). They found that faceting is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for Au, Pd and Pt on Mo(111). Faceting is thermodynamically forbidden for Cu on Mo(111), and thermodynamically allowed but kinetically blocked for AgMo(111). Their results are in excellent agreement with our experimental observations
[4]
.
The majority of our previous experiments on metal-covered Mo(111) and W(111) have involved heating to elevated temperatures to induce faceting, following by cooling to 300 K for LEED and STM studies (heatquench measurements). Kinetics of growth are inferred from changes in structure as a function of annealing time and temperature. Whereas these results have been extremely useful, better insights into kinetic processes could be gained by in situ measurements at elevated temperatures. Very recently we have initiated a collaboration with Dr Gary Kellogg, Sandia National Laboratories, to use low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) for characterizing the kinetics of faceting in real time, at elevated temperatures.
Because the contrast mechanism in LEEM is based on diffraction of low-energy electrons, the method is sensitive to the topmost layer of surface atoms, and its effective depth resolution is of the order of one atomic layer
[22]
,
[23]
. We have demonstrated that facets can be detected and the growth of faceted regions can be studied. Whereas the nucleation size of an individual facet is below the lateral resolution limit (10 nm), nonetheless, there is sufficient contrast to measure the growth characteristics of faceted regions. Our initial results, for PtW, are very encouraging
[24]
. During deposition of Pt onto a heated W(111) surface, one can watch in real time as faceted regions nucleate at random points on the surface, then grow to form an interconnected network, and, ultimately, cover the surface completely when the Pt coverage reaches one physical ML. A fraction of the facets disappears upon heating above 1300 K, and the remaining facets coexist with planar regions.
3.1.2. Morphological changes induced by metals on W(211)
LEED observations of faceted surfaces suggest that in some cases the (211) faces of the pyramidal facets do not exhibit the bulk termination structure, but may undergo further reconstruction
[7]
. To address this issue more carefully, we have been investigating the behavior of the planar W(211) surface when covered by ultrathin films of Rh, Pt, and Pd using TPD of the metal overlayer at very high temperatures (up to 2200 K), AES, a quartz crystal monitor for coverage measurements, LEED, and STM. We have found that upon annealing above a threshold temperature of 900 K, both Rh and Pt cause a (3×1) reconstruction of the W(211) surface. Correlation with TPD and AES data, however, indicates that reconstruction is limited only to a narrow coverage range: between 0.5 and 1.0 physical monolayer
[25]
.

shows an LEED pattern characteristic of the (3×1) structure for <1 ML of RhW(211) annealed to 1300 K. The real-space STM image for the same RhW(211) surface is shown in
Fig. 5b
. The long, straight ribbons in the STM image correspond to adsorbed Rh rows separated by missing rows of Rh atoms; the periodicity across the rows is three times the unit cell dimensions. We are currently investigating the detailed atomic structure, viz. a missing row model versus nanofaceting of RhW(211).

.
To provide insights into the metal overlayer coverages and desorption energies, we have extended our TPD capability to allow accurate control of linear heating rates to T>2500 K. Three features can be seen in the TPD spectra of Pd on W(211), as shown in
Fig. 6
. Using the quartz crystal monitor (QCM), we identify the coverage corresponding to saturation of the two peaks at 1400 K and 1600 K as one physical ML. The peak at lowest T (1300 K) is due to sublimation of bulk Pd. The desorption behavior of Pt and Rh are similar; however, the lower temperature fractional monolayer peak coincides with the bulk TPD peak. The first-order desorption energies and pre-exponentials derived in a detailed analysis from Pd data of the type

are shown in
Fig. 6b
. The high pre-exponential (1016 s1) is indicative of hindered mobility at desorption temperatures

.
Part of the motivation for careful TPD measurements is to ascertain the binding energy differences between metalW(211) and metalW(111), which may provide insights into the large surface free energy anisotropy of these systems
[7]
. The anisotropy of surface energy is believed to be the main driving force behind the faceting phenomena. Careful complementary measurements for metals on W(111) are underway.
3.1.3. Faceting of curved surfaces by FEM
To extend our studies of adsorbate-induced faceting from planar single crystals to curved micro-crystals, we have initiated a series of studies using FEM. This activity is a collaboration with the group of Professor R. Blaszczyszyn of the University of Wroclaw (Poland).
The typical W emitter tip is a hemispherical cap on a conical shank; its radius of curvature is 200 nm. The shape and dimensions are a rough approximation to a small bimetallic catalyst particle, albeit somewhat larger. We find that for coverages >1 ML and 700<T<1100 K, the Pt-, Pd- and Rh-covered W tips undergo faceting: a transition from a nearly spherical tip shape to a more polyhedral shape. In all cases, we observe a growth in size of W{211} facets, and the formation of new, stable facets that are not present on the clean tip (W {321} in the case of Rh, and W {431} in the case of Pd). The results demonstrate that overlayer metals may stabilize vicinal surfaces as well as close-packed surfaces
[27]
. These observations also have interesting implications for the equilibrium shape of nanoscale bimetallic catalyst particles.
3.1.4. Restructuring of W(111) by sulfur overlayers
There are several motivating factors for studying SW(111). In a previous LEED experiment, S was reported to be among the (non-metallic) elements that induce facets on W(111)
[7]
; moreover, the LEED data displayed unusual characteristics that merited a microscopic investigation. Recent STM studies of S adsorbed on a different bcc(111) surface, Fe(111), have revealed unusual S-induced structural changes
[28]
. From a more practical point of view, thin overlayers of sulfur on W are important as catalytic modifiers, and solid state lubricants are composed of WS2 nanoparticles
[29]
. The present results are quite unexpected: rather than causing extended pyramidal facets with {211} faces, an S overlayer induces a nanoscale reconstruction of W(111) with (4×4) periodicity, and causes a rich sequence of domain growth behavior
[30]
.
The present study provides insights into the evolution of surface structure accompanying an unusual two-dimensional reconstruction. In addition, we are able to draw more far-reaching conclusions that have implications for growth sequences in other surface reconstructions, including facet growth
[31]
.
Dosing W(111) with a saturation coverage of H2S followed by annealing to >800 K causes the dissociation of H2S and the desorption of hydrogen. The S-covered substrate reconstructs, and forms a structure with (4×4) periodicity. A LEED pattern showing (4×4) symmetry is shown in
Fig. 7a
. After the formation of the (4×4) structure over the entire surface, and upon further annealing, the terrace-step configurations also restructure and form triangular terraces with edges running along [101] or equivalent directions. See
Fig. 7b
, an STM image showing triangular domains with (4×4) symmetry. Upon heating to T>1000 K, these triangular terraces coalesce and enlarge to form extended terraces (
Fig. 7c
), in addition to forming multiple steps. As annealing temperatures exceed 1300 K, the terrace-step configuration is disordered. Eventually, the (4×4) local order disappears as a result of sulfur desorption from the W substrate.

When viewed at higher magnification (see

appears to be composed of six atoms on the top layer forming the (4×4) unit cell of the restructured surface.

. (b) Hard-sphere model showing atomic structure of the unit cell.
A size-mismatch mechanism, based on charge transfer between S and W atoms, is proposed to explain the formation of (4×4) structures. Strain introduced at the surface by adsorption of large sulfur anions is relieved by formation of the (4×4) reconstruction. Moreover, as seen in atomic-resolution studies (
Fig. 8a
), each (4×4) unit cell is found to accommodate an atomic vacancy, which is believed to play a significant role in the strain relief mechanism. As a result, the local concentration of these atomic vacancies provides a rationale to explain the observed orientation of the triangular terraces. Another factor influencing the surface morphology is the structural variety of the atomic steps that define the terrace edges. We have explored in great detail
[31]
the consequences of a terrace growth mechanism for S(4×4)W(111) that is based on local step structures, coupled with domain mismatch.
We believe that this study has important implications that extend beyond this specific system. We have developed general principles of surface domain growth, which provide insights into the relationship between the surface reconstruction and the morphological changes in various surfaceinterface systems, including the coarsening of facets in the case of PdW(111).
3.2. Surface chemistry on planar and faceted surfaces: cyclization and other reaction pathways for C2H2 on bimetallic surfaces
Understanding the role of surface structure in chemical reactions is an important first step in delineating the fundamental aspects of catalytic mechanisms. The surface chemistry of acetylene is an interesting example, because pathways are known to be highly sensitive to surface structure. For example, the acetylene cyclization reaction
has been studied extensively on clean and modified surfaces
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
, under UHV conditions as well as high pressure conditions. A noteworthy aspect of this reaction is the remarkable efficiency for making CC bonds without undergoing CC bond scission. Certain surfaces, such as Pd(111)
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
and Cu(110)
[37]
are highly selective towards cyclization of acetylene, whereas Pd(110) is much less active. Several bimetallic systems have also been reported to have different degrees of activities. Other reaction pathways include hydrogenation to form ethylene, the formation of reaction intermediates (e.g. C4Hx), and acetylene decomposition.
We have chosen to investigate acetylene surface chemistry on PdW bimetallic surfaces. Most of our work to date is for PdW(211), although we have preliminary data for Pd on planar and faceted W(111) surfaces. The surface geometrical structure of W(211) is similar (but not identical) to that of an fcc(110) row-and-trough configuration [recall that Pd(110) is relatively inactive for cyclization, whereas Cu(110) exhibits high activity]. Our goal is to determine whether deposition of thin films of Pd onto W(211) can perturb the electronic structures of both metals sufficiently to enhance the reactivity towards cyclization. Note that PdW does not form an alloy at 1 ML coverage; the Pd remains in the topmost layer of the bimetallic surface
[38]
. We find using TPD and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) that acetylene surface chemistry is quite different on clean W(211) and Pd-covered W(211)
[35]
,
[39]
,
[40]
. The HREELS measurements were performed in collaboration with Dr J.G. Chen of EXXON Corporate Research Laboratories.
Our first experiments were on clean and carbide-modified W(211) surfaces: we find that acetylene does not cyclotrimerize to form benzene, as revealed by comparing HREELS and TPD studies of acetylene and benzene on the two surfaces. Instead, acetylene decomposes between 100450 K on the clean W(211) surface, ultimately forming carbidic carbon and gaseous hydrogen
[40]
. During this decomposition process, a mixture of different hydrocarbon fragments are formed, most likely vinylidene (CCH2) or vinyl (HCCH2), and acetylide (CCH). On the carbide-modified W(211) surface, acetylene also decomposes to produce carbon and gaseous hydrogen. However, compared with clean W(211), the CH bond activation is suppressed on the carbide-modified W surface, as evidenced by the broadening and significant shifting of the H2 TPD features towards higher temperatures, as well as by the HREEL spectra monitoring the thermal decomposition of acetylene on the carbide-modified W(211) surface
[40]
.
We next examined the influence of Pd films (from monolayer to multilayer) on C2H2 surface chemistry
[35]
,
[39]
. A single ML of Pd on W(211) decreases the high reactivity towards acetylene decomposition and several different reaction pathways are accessed, including hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4, and cyclotrimerization of C2H2 to form C6H6. The cyclotrimerization reaction produces three benzene desorption states at 340, 390, and 430 K. In addition, the detection of C4H6 during TPD provides evidence that an elusive C4H4 intermediate is present on the surface. Ethylene is also observed in substantial yields. The relative intensities of the various desorption products following adsorption of C2H2 are estimated from the product TPD spectra, as illustrated in
Fig. 9
. Note that the relative intensities of C6H+6 and C4H+6 reaction product peaks are comparable, verifying that C4H+6 is not part of the cracking pattern of benzene; rather, the C4H+6 is evidence for a stable surface species. In addition, the common features at 340 and 420 K in the TPD spectra of C4H6 and C6H6 (
Fig. 9
) are consistent with the involvement of a C4H4 intermediate in the reaction pathway for benzene formation. The TPD peak intensity of ethylene is greater than that of benzene or C4H6, indicating that acetylene hydrogenation is a favored reaction pathway. The relative product yields are 45% C2H4, 6% C4H6 and 6% C6H6. The remaining acetylene either desorbs intact or dissociates.

The use of HREELS provides complementary information regarding the reaction mechanisms of acetylene on the PdW(211) surfaces
[39]
,
[40]
. When 1 ML PdW(211) is covered by acetylene at 100 K most of the HREELS features are consistent with molecular C2H2, with evidence of small concentrations of acetylide (CCH). Upon heating to 350 K and 450 K, features consistent with acetylene in a di-σ-bonded configuration are found. Most notably, no features characteristic of adsorbed C6H6 or C4H4 are found in this case, indicating that formation of these desorption products is reaction-limited. In other cases (e.g. 6 ML PdW), evidence for stable C4H4 and C6H6 species is seen in HREELS.
A particularly interesting result is found for 6 ML PdW(211) that has been pre-annealed to 1050 K: the reactivity to benzene formation is five times higher than for 1 ML PdW(211). As discussed in
Section 3.3
, we suggest that the enhanced activity is a consequence of alloy film formation.
3.3. Electronic properties of bimetallic interfaces
Certain ultrathin films on W(111) and Mo(111) substrates can induce faceting, e.g. Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt or Au (as well as O, Cl), whereas others do not, e.g. Co, Ti, Gd, Ni, Cu, Ag
[4]
. All the elements that are observed to induce faceting have Pauling electronegativities >2.0, whereas the others have electronegativities <2.0. This observation suggests that the electronic structure of the interface plays a role in faceting. In order to provide further insight into possible electronic factors that influence faceting, we use high-resolution SXPS, based on synchrotron radiation; we study (mainly) the sharp W4f core-level features, and measure surface core-level shifts (SCLS). Based on an extensive series of measurements, we can draw several important conclusions from this work.
•
There is a correlation between the W4f7/2 interfacial core-level binding energy and the corresponding heat of adsorption of metal films on W(111) and W(211): the higher the W4f7/2 interfacial binding energy, the higher the heat of adsorption of the metal films. Electronegativity does not correlate with interfacial core-level shifts of the W substrate
[18]
.
•
Monolayer films of metals that induce faceting are thermally stable and do not form alloys; in contrast, multilayer films of certain metals (Pt, Pd) form thin film alloys with W upon heating to T>700 K. Alloy surfaces are seen to exhibit unusual catalytic activity
[41]
.
3.3.1. Monolayer metals on W(111) and W(211): SCLS
The W4f photoemission at a photon energy of 75 eV is very sensitive to the surface region
[18]
,
[42]
. As shown in
Fig. 10
, three W4f7/2 features are clearly resolved, and are assigned as the bulk (the feature with the highest binding energy), the third surface layer (shifted by 121 meV from the bulk feature), and the unresolved first- and second-layer features (shifted by 446 meV with respect to the bulk). Owing to the shallow mean-free-path for photoemitted electrons (corresponding to a thickness of 1 ML at electron kinetic energies 45 eV), the combined intensities of the surface W4f7/2 features are greater than that of the bulk.

Fig. 10. (a) (left) The W4f7/2 spectrum of clean W(111) taken at 100 K with a photon energy of 75 eV. The long dashed lines are the results of a non-linear least squares fit to the data. (b) (right) The W4f7/2 spectra of 1 ML metal films on W(111). The solid line is for CuW(111), the solid circles are for AgW(111), and the open squares are for AuW(111).
The existence of surface W4f7/2 core levels distinct from the bulk is a manifestation of the vacuumW(111) interface. As a metal overlayer is deposited onto W(111), the vacuumW(111) interface is replaced by a solidW(111) interface. Thus, the W4f7/2 photoemission spectra are changed from that of clean W(111) due to screening by the overlayers, as shown in
Fig. 10
for Cu, Ag and Au on W(111)
[18]
. In general, the W4f7/2surface core-level features shift to higher binding energy as the interface is formed.
Based on a large set of data similar to that shown in
Fig. 10b
, we use difference spectra to determine the geometrical mean energy of the interfacial W4f7/2 binding energy features; the calculated quantity for each overlayer is taken to be the interfacial binding energy. In
Fig. 11
we plot the interfacial W4f7/2 binding energy versus the heat of adsorption of the corresponding metals on W(111) and find a correlation
[18]
. Our observation is that the higher the heat of adsorption, the higher is the interfacial binding energy. On the other hand, no clear correlation exists between Pauling electronegativity and interfacial 4f7/2 binding energies. This is not surprising, since the Pauling electronegativity is a measure of initial state effects, whereas the measured 4f7/2 binding energy is influenced by a combination of initial and final state effects. Conclusions regarding core-level shifts in the metal overlayer must await further measurements.

[18]
.
It is interesting to note that those metals having the highest heats of adsorption, and the highest W4f7/2 interfacial binding energies, are those which cause faceting (Pt, Pd). This is also consistent with the theory of Che et al.
[21]
mentioned previously: a higher heat of adsorption provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for faceting, and a lowered kinetic barrier to faceting. For metals at the midrange of values (see
Fig. 11
), a clear distinction is not possible (Au causes faceting, whereas Co and Ni do not). A similar data set similar to that of
Fig. 12
has been measured for metals on W(211), with similar results.

3.3.2. Thermal stability of monolayer films; evidence for alloy formation in multilayers
SXPS shows evidence for the thermal stability for single monolayer films of metals that cause faceting
[41]
; this was also seen previously for PdW(111) using low energy ion scattering (LEIS)
[38]
. This is an important issue, because the metals are believed to float on the surface, acting as surfactants that affect the anisotropy in surface energy. An annealing sequence for one physical monolayer of Pd on W(211) is shown in
Fig. 12a
. After dosing, a single W4f7/2 feature (interface+bulk) is seen (lowest curve). Photoelectron spectra measured after annealing to higher temperatures reveal that there is no change in peak intensity, width or peak shape for T1200 K; i.e. the film is stable, remains on the surface, and no evidence for an alloy (extra peaks  see below) is found. This supports the results of AES and LEIS measurements
[38]
and is consistent with a recent theoretical analysis of the stability of surface alloy phases
[43]
. Above 1400 K, where desorption is rapid, the surface features characteristic of W(211) appear in the W4f7/2 spectra.
When multilayer films of metals are deposited onto W(111), W(211), etc., substantial changes in Auger electron intensity are observed at temperatures well below the onset of desorption of the overlayer
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
. This is commonly observed for many bimetallic systems, and is generally interpreted to indicate a change in surface morphology: the overlayer material (in excess of 1 ML) agglomerates into clusters. Direct evidence for cluster formation for Pd on faceted W(111) has also been seen using the STM
[16]
. However, this explanation appears not to be adequate for Pd and Pt on W(211), where evidence for alloy formation without significant clustering is observed.
Fig. 12b
is a series of SXPS W[4f7/2] spectra corresponding to annealing of a 5 ML Pd film on W(211)
[41]
. In contrast to the case of
Fig. 12a
, we find that a new feature appears in the spectra upon annealing above 700 K. The new feature is shifted 1 eV toward higher binding energy than bulk W4f. The near-constancy of the bulk W4f7/2 peak indicates that the film remains flat, i.e. no agglomeration into clusters. The appearance of the new peak appears to indicate that W atoms diffuse into the overlayer Pd film to form a dilute alloy
[41]
. As the temperature increases above 850 K, the concentration of W atoms in the PdW alloy increases, and the W4f binding energy changes. Similar evidence for alloy formation is found for PtW(211), whereas AuW(211) does not form an alloy. Although these results were not anticipated, they are consistent with bulk phase diagrams that indicate that Pd(Pt) has negligible solubility in W, whereas W is soluble in Pd(Pt).
The presence of surface alloys has important implications for surface reactivity. As indicated previously in
Section 3.2
, the Pd alloy film is substantially more active for acetylene cyclization than a single Pd monolayer
[41]
.
In summary, the SXPS studies of bimetallic systems have provided important insights into interfacial properties. Note that all of the data shown here have been for the substrate core levels. Recently, we have measured 4f core-level shifts for overlayer films of Pt, Ir and Au on W(111) and W(211). In the cases of Pt and Ir, evidence for alloy film formation is seen from 4f7/2 core level shifts for both overlayer and substrate
[44]
.
4. Conclusion
We have summarized recent results from a comprehensive program to study the structural, chemical and electronic properties of morphologically unstable bimetallic surfaces. The data presented are among the first detailed microscopic studies of faceting of metals induced by ultrathin metallic films. We believe that these results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of dynamic morphological changes at the surfaces of bimetallic catalysts during operation.
