Abstract
A detailed comparative study of Cu growth on the vicinal surface Pt(12 12 11) has been performed with helium atom
scattering (HAS) and medium energy ion scattering (MEIS). These techniques are ideally complementary in that HAS is
extremely sensitive to the electronic structure of the surface layer, while MEIS accurately probes the atom core structure
of the surface. By combining these two techniques it has been possible to measure the initial structure of Cu on the
stepped Pt surface and to study how the Cu redistributes across the surface and into the bulk on annealing. The HAS
and MEIS data identify two significant diffusion transitions on the surface occurring at temperatures of 450 and 600 K.

1. Introduction
The growth of Cu on Pt(1 1 1) has been studied
extensively both as an evaporated film in UHV
using helium atom scattering (HAS) and STM,
and as an electrodeposited film in liquid using
STM. The combination of Cu and Pt is expected to
generate interesting structures as there is an 8%
difference in the lattice constant for these materials
hence epitaxial growth will involve considerable
lattice strain.
Submonolayer growth of Cu on Pt(1 1 1) is
epitaxial, with the strong PtCu bond driving
commensurate, strained growth of a copper over-
layer. LEED patterns retain sharp, 1  1 structures
without significant diffuse scattering. At room
temperature, STM and HAS evidence suggests
that
growth
is
dendritic,
indicating
that
Cu
adatom diffusion across terraces is facile but that
diffusion/migration about island and step edges is
kinetically limited. As coverage increases, dendritic
islands merge to form a 2d monolayer with a few
defects and holes attributed to the merging of
individual islands.
This study has grown out of a complementary
study of Pt growth on Cu(1 1 1) [13] and it builds
on the HAS and STM study of Cu growth on
Pt(1 1 1) [4,5] which investigated the growth of Cu
on a flat crystal. From these studies it is clear that
steps play an important role. To enhance the role
of step edges and to ultimately probe the structure
of the film at a step edge, a vicinal surface,

(12 12 11), was used which provides a large number
of steps while also ensuring relatively large terrace
widths. One goal of the project is to compare and
contrast the information provided by HAS and
medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) to better
characterise the structural information obtainable
about a crystal surface growth processes.
In a parallel study using HAS [6] the surface
rearrangement and alloying of 0.5 ML of Cu
deposited on Pt(12 12 11) has revealed a number
of interesting phases (see Fig. 1). In this study the
reflectivity of the surface is monitored as the
sample is annealed. If the film underwent no
rearrangement the reflectivity would drop expo-
nentially with increasing temperature to reflect the
increased thermal vibration effects of the target
atoms. However for this combination there is
apparently a much more complex sequence of
events. There are several irreversible phase transi-
tions:
abslow kinetically-limited smoothing invol-
ving significant mass transfer. This is initiated at
200 K and increases rapidly at 300 K;
bdtwo sharp transitions centred on 480 K
consistent with a reconstruction causing rough-
ening then the onset of alloying leading to a
smoothing as evidenced by the increased specular
yield;
dfgseveral distinct phases. The sharp in-
crease in reflectivity at 800 K is consistent with the
expected

of
these
elements. Mobility is not frozen until the tempera-
ture drops below 520 K.
2. Experimental methods
MEIS data were taken at the UK MEIS facility
which is described in detail elsewhere [7]. The
chamber base pressure was 5  1010 mbar. The
sample was bombarded by a collimated beam of
100 keV H+ ions and scattered ions were analysed
by a toroidal electrostatic analyser which had an
effective acceptance angle in the scattering plane of
20. Each data set is the cumulative signal from a
typical ion dose of 1016 ions cm2.
The samples were sputter cleaned using normal
cycles of Ar ion bombardment and annealing until
no contamination from oxygen or carbon was
detectable with either Auger electron spectroscopy
(AES) or MEIS. In the MEIS phase, three
different incident geometries (Fig. 2) were used
to expose selectively the first ([1 1 0]), first two
([1 1 2]) or first three atomic layers ([1 1 4]). This
provides maximum sensitivity to measurements of
surface relaxation as well as allowing the monitor-
ing of the movement of Cu between these three
layers. The geometries used in the MEIS measure-
ments is outlined in Table 1.
Copper was deposited from a rod heated by

Deposition of Cu was performed at tempera-
tures ranging from 200 to 400 K with measure-
ments either made at 200 K or in some cases a
ramped anneal sequence was undertaken in which
the temperature was increased in typically 50 K
steps from 200 to 700 K. In the ramped annealed

cases only the [1 1 4] incident geometry was used to
save time and to obtain measurements where all
three surface layers were equally irradiated by the
incident beam.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Data analysis
The MEIS data is collected as a two-dimen-
sional data set covering both an energy window
and an angular range. The effective angular
window is 20. Careful analysis was required as
the Cu peak sits on a sloping background from the
Pt surface peak. Without considerable attention to
the fitting process, the apparent Cu yield could
represent a part of the background (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, the fitting process reveals that the
Pt peak consistently comprises two distinct peaks
rather than a single asymmetric peak. The higher
energy peak involves the elastic scattering of H of
Pt, while the lower energy peak is believed to be a
loss peak. The loss peak typically has a yield of
20% of the elastic peak and the energy loss is
approximately 350 eV 710%. This uncertainty
arises as there are a number of unknowns in the
fitting process, in particular the shape of the
background signal when it intersects the Pt elastic
peak. Using a number of different functions and
assumptions a range of different fits were obtained
which lead to this uncertainty in the loss energy. It
is interesting to observe that similar measurements
made using He (not in this study) reveal a highly
symmetric peak so this feature would seem to be a
function of the interaction between protons and
the target. The most probably explanation for the
energy loss is electron promotion resulting from
the interaction of a proton with the electron energy

levels of platinum. Analysis of the energy level
diagram (Fig. 4) for Pt [8] reveals that the observed
energy loss involves ionisation from the 4d level
(B310 eV).
In addition to the fitting of the energy spectra,
there was an apparent charge exchange process
which needed to be accounted for in the angular
scans. Once the raw data was corrected for cross-
section and converted to the unit of atoms per row,
there was a trend in the angular profile of
increasing yield from low scattering angle to high
scattering angle. This trend was not related to the
interatomic potential used as it was evident for a
broad range of potentials. The trend was contrary
to the predictions of computer simulations and
produced results which were not supported by
considerations of blocking and channelling. Other
than the interatomic potential, the possible causes
are either a uniformly changing detection effi-
ciency across the microchannel plates, or a varying
charge fraction of the scattered projectiles as a
function of exit angle to the surface. While this is a
common expectation for inert gas scattering, the
occurrence of a charge exchange effect is less
common

3.2. Clean Pt(12 12 11)
A key preliminary phase involved determining
the structure and thermal vibrations of a clean
Pt(12 12 11) surface (Fig. 5). Using the three
geometries described in Fig. 2, data was collected
and compared with the VEGAS program [9] to
identify the relaxation between the first and second
atomic layers, the second and third atomic layers
and the enhancement of the thermal vibration
amplitudes for the atoms of the first atomic layer
and the second atomic layer. The bulk thermal
vibration amplitude was determined from the Pt
Debye temperature of 240 K. The data from all
three geometries were fitted to the computer
simulations simultaneously to obtain the best
overall fit between data and simulation.

The Pt(1 1 1) surface has attracted considerable
interest involving many different techniques [10
13] however the consensus view is that there is no
measurable relaxation at room temperature but at
elevated temperature and for surfaces exposed to
adsorbates there is significant reconstruction. This
is still a contested result and a recent paper has
offered very accurate estimates of relaxation for
Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature [14]. In this study the
clean sample was measured at room temperature.
The outcome of our MEIS measurement was an
estimate that the first interlayer spacing increased
by 0.04 (
A and the second interlayer spacing
decreased by 0.02 (
A. This is unusual as the
expectation in most circumstances is a compres-
sion of the first interlayer spacing and a smaller
expansion of the second interlayer spacing.
However these values are in excellent agreement
with recent LEED determinations [14] of the
structure of clean Pt(1 1 1) in which it was found
that the first interlayer spacing was increased by
0.035 (
A and the second interlayer spacing was
reduced by 0.01 (
A relative to the bulk spacing they
measure.
In
both
sets
of
measurements
the
uncertainty is quoted to be typically 70.02 (
A.
Relative to the recognised bulk value of 2.265 (
A
the first and second layer spacings were quoted to
be +0.02 (
A and 0.02 (
A.
In the same paper, it is claimed that there is an
in-plane contraction of 0.5% which may not be
seen in these experiments as the 50 lattice spacing
between step edges may be enough to relieve the
compression and frustrate observable lateral shifts.
However this stress may cause random displace-
ments in which case it could appear as an increased
thermal vibration amplitude. The thermal vibra-
tion amplitudes were determined to be 0.094 (
A for
the first layer and 0.092 (
A for the second layer
which is to be compared to 0.064 (
A for the third
and subsequent layers. The larger than expected
value for the second layer may be due to a random
disorder induced by the measured contraction.
3.3. Submonolayer growth of Cu on Pt(12 12 11) at
300 K
Cu deposition was conducted at a range of
substrate temperatures and with different cov-
erages. For films grown on a substrate at or below
300 K and with a coverage significantly less than
one monolayer (i.e. o0.75 ML), it was found that
the Cu overlayer was observed to relax. The data
was fitted by assuming the Cu to form islands on
the surface [4] and the data was compared to a
linear sum of simulations comprising a portion of
the surface which is clean Pt and a portion which is
covered by a monolayer of Cu which is relaxed.
The proportions used of the two models was
determined from the measured Cu coverage. This
model fitted the data well and from the fit it is
possible to conclude that the Cu covered compo-
nent experienced a relaxation of 0.1670.02 (
A. It
was also possible to measure the thermal vibration
amplitude using the same approach and the first
layer thermal vibration amplitude was determined
to be 0.1270.005 (
A and the second layer was
0.1070.005 (
A. The quality of these fits is shown in
Fig. 6.
Previous STM [4] studies indicate that there is a
change
in
morphology
once
a
monolayer
is
formed. The Cu islands grow and coalesce but a
second layer starts to develop before all the holes
are filled in the first layer. It is for this reason that
one result for 0.82 ML coverage is believed to not
fit the relaxations outlined above although the
level of disagreement is small as the relaxation is
given as 0.19 (
A and the thermal vibration ampli-
tudes are 0.13 and 0.10 (
A.
Most noticeably different was a set of deposi-
tions
which
were
performed
at
a
substrate
temperature of 400 K. These results could not be
fitted simply by a sum of clean Pt(1 1 1) and
relaxed Cu surface. While there is compelling
evidence for a relaxation of 0.16 (
A there is
evidence of other structural features not yet
resolved. This effect causes a significant variation
between the widths of the blocking dips in the
simulation and the experiment.
3.4. Annealing submonolayer Cu/Pt(12 12 11)
Key insights into the surface kinetics of a
submonolayer Cu film can be gained by monitor-
ing the MEIS signal with sample temperature. A
copper film of B0.5 ML coverage was grown at a
sample temperature of 150 K. Following MEIS the

sample was then annealed at a selected tempera-
ture (up to 650 K) for 5 min, then cooled rapidly
back to 120 K for analysis. As alloying was
expected to alter the layer-by-layer elemental
composition, data was recorded in the [1 1 4]
incident geometry, where the first three surface
layers were irradiated equally by the ion beam.
With this geometry it is possible to use shadowing
and blocking to observe largely the composition of
the first layer, the first and second layer and the
first three layers. Thus if three Pt yields are taken
at appropriate scattering angles on a clean surface
the Pt signal yields in these three different exit
geometries would be in a simple ratio of 1:2:3. In
reality this is not the case as there are two effects
which
could
either
increase
or
decrease
the
scattered component from Pt. The first is that
the incident ion beam has some small probability
of striking atoms in deeper layers which means
that more than the expected number of layers will
be observed. The second effect is that in the Pt3
geometry (where we should see the Pt from the first
three layers only), some of the lattice sites will be
occupied by Cu thus reducing the Pt3 signal.
To monitor the movement of Cu, the yields were
normalised to provide the yields Pt1 (which
constitutes largely the first layer Pt component),
Pt2 which is basically the first and second layer,
and Pt3 which constitutes the first three layers. The
signal Cu is largely the first layer Cu signal. To
remove fluctuations in experimental parameters all
signals have been normalised to that called Pt3.
The variation in yield as a function of tempera-
ture is revealed in Fig. 7. From this figure it is clear
that at approximately 350 K, the Cu signal starts
to decline and the first layer Pt signal starts to rise.
This transition continues until the temperature
reaches 500 K. This simplest conclusion is that the
elements are moving but there is a possibility that
these changes reflect a rearrangement or recon-
struction
of
the
near-surface
region.
This
is
consistent with the findings of the HAS experi-
ments in which significant changes were observed

to take place over the temperature range of 300
500 K resulting in an alloying process.
4. Conclusions
Accurate measurements of the structure of clean
Pt(12 12 11) and Cu covered Pt(12 12 11) have been
performed using MEIS and HAS. The data
indicates that while the clean Pt (12 12 11) surface
is essentially unreconstructed, the Cu covered
Pt(1 1 1) surface appears to undergo a reconstruc-
tion thats essentially constant for all coverages up
to 1 ML provided the deposition temperature is
300 K or less. There appear to be two main
diffusion processes that are activated with tem-
perature. While bulk diffusion of Cu into Pt(1 1 1)
appears to be activated above 500 K, an additional
process is activated just above room temperature.
The ion scattering data is supported by the HAS
data which shows a significant departure from the
normal DebyeWaller decay behaviour at this
temperature.
