Abstract 
The morphology of Pt/Cu surface alloys is studied by CO and Xe adsorption/desorption after annealing Pt films on a 
Cu(111) substrate at temperatures above 500 K. The topmost layer consists of dispersed Pt atoms in a Cu matrix. The Xe 
desorption peak maximum proportionally shifts to lower temperatures with decreasing Pt surface concentration. Accordingly, 
Xe TDS can be used to determine the Pt concentration in the surface. The adsorption properties of CO on the thus prepared 
PtCu surfaces have been studied by thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), high resolution electron energy loss 
spectroscopy (HREELS), and work function change measurements (Ab). Pt, Cu, and mixed adsorption sites can be 
distinguished with TDS. HREELS shows that CO on top of Pt is the prevalent adsorbed species. Both HREELS and A b 
show that the amount of bridge bonded CO has a minimum at a surface concentration of 20% Pt.

L Introduction 
Most of the heterogeneous catalysts in industrial 
processes are 
more-component systems. 
Conse- 
quently adsorption studies on alloy surfaces with 
changing compositions may contribute to the under- 
standing of some of these processes. In this respect 
the concepts of ensemble effect and ligand effect 
[1,2] have been developed. Alloying metals changes 
their geometrical and electronical structure and, as a 
consequence, also their interaction with adsorbed 
species [3]. For Pt/Cu alloys it has been found that 
they are catalytically more selective for cracking 
reactions than pure platinum [4].

It is well known that Cu and Pt are completely 
miscible, and at low temperatures three ordered 
phases (Cu3Pt, CuPt, CuPt 3) are found. In contrast 
to this, no ordered surface alloys were found after 
annealing Pt films on Cu(111) [5]. Above 500 K the 
Pt atoms diffuse into the Cu bulk and disordered 
PtCu surface alloys are formed. 
In the present study we use the adsorption/de- 
sorption of Xe and CO as a sensitive probe for the 
determination of the surface composition of Pt/Cu 
surface alloys. Xe physisorbs below 100 K; the two 
surface species Cu and Pt induce different dipole 
moments in the Xe atoms. By measuring the van- 
der-Waals interaction of Xe with the surface in a TD 
experiment one can distinguish the adsorption on the 
two components. However, due to the large diameter 
of the Xe atom (4.8 ) the desorption energy of a Xe 
atom from a mixed Cu/Pt site reflects only an

average desorption energy value. By contrast, the 
chemisorbed CO molecule has a more localized 
binding to the substrate atoms. Thus, the characteri- 
zation of the adsorption properties of CO is more site 
specific. For Xe and CO the interaction to Pt is 
stronger than to Cu [6-8]. 
The aim of this work is to study the morphology 
and the changes in the adsorption behaviour with 
increasing Pt concentration in the topmost layer of 
the Cu-Pt surface alloys. 
2. Experimental procedure 
The experiments were performed in an ultra- 
high-vacuum (UHV) system with a base pressure of 
1 × 10 
-l hPa. The system was equipped with a 
high resolution electron energy loss spectrometer 
(HREELS, Leybold ELS22), an Auger electron spec- 
trometer (CMA), a LEED optics, a quadrupole mass 
spectrometer for the thermal desorption experiments 
(TDS), and a home made vibrating capacitor Kelvin 
probe for work function change measurements. The 
sample temperature could be varied in the range of 
35-1200 K using a liquid helium cryostat for sample 
cooling and electron bombardment for heating. In the 
present study the Xe adsorption was performed by 
cooling with liquid helium to 35 K. For the CO 
adsorption experiments at 90 K the sample was 
cooled with liquid nitrogen. The sample temperature 
was monitored using a type E thermocouple which 
was fitted into a hole in one side of the crystal. 
The rectangular Cu single crystal was oriented in 
the [111] direction with a precision better than 0.5 
. 
The sample was cleaned by cycles of Ar+-ion bom- 
bardment and annealing at 900 K. The sample clean- 
liness was monitored by AES. Pt was deposited via a 
home made evaporation source using electron bom- 
bardment of a 99.999% purity Pt foil. The pressure 
increase during the operation of the source was 
below 8 × 10-0 hPa. The determination of the Pt 
overlayer thickness is described elsewhere [9]. By 
heating the Pt film to different temperatures above 
500 K it is possible to form Pt/Cu surface alloys as 
shown in the following text. The variation of the 
CuPt-composition of the alloy surfaces was recorded 
by measuring the Cu (105 eV) and Pt (237 eV) AES 
intensities (Ir, Ic.)- The platinum concentration cpt 
in the first 2-3 layers is calculated from the ratio 
Ipt/(Ipt q- S" lcu) [10] considering the relative sensi- 
tivity factor of s = 1.64 for the measured Auger 
signals [ 
I I ]. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Xe adsorption on Pt / Cu(l l l ) surface alloys 
Before starting with gas adsorption experiments 
on the Pt/Cu surface alloys the Pt diffusion in the 
surface is characterized by AES. For this purpose 2 
ML Pt are evaporated onto the Cu(111) surface and 
shortly heated to increasing temperatures with a heat- 
ing rate of 6 K/s. The detected Pt concentration 
remains constant up to 500 K. Above this tempera- 
ture the Pt diffusion into the Cu(lll) bulk starts and 
becomes more rapid with increasing sample tempera- 
ture. After heating to 900 K still 20% of the Pt atoms 
are in the first substrate layer. These measurements 
are in good agreement with previous studies [5,12], 
which also find a Pt diffusion starting around 500 K. 
By controlled heating to different sample tempera- 
tures it is therefore possible to produce Pt/Cu sur= 
face alloys with different Pt surface concentrations. 
As already shown in previous experiments [9], Xe 
TDS is a good probe to monitor the Pt-Cu surface 
composition. Fig. l a shows Xe desorption spectra 
obtained from an initial 2 ML Pt/Cu(lll) system 
shortly heated to increasing temperatures. Xe is ad- 
sorbed at 35 K. Each Pt/Cu surface can be used for 
a whole set of TD spectra with different Xe precov- 
erages because heating the sample to 150 K effects 
no diffusion of Pt atoms into the Cu bulk. Two 
regions can be distinguished in Fig. la, which ex- 
hibits only high Xe coverage spectra. The Xe desorp- 
tion at 63 K can be associated to Xe multilayer 
desorpfion like on the clean Cu(lll) surface. The 
peak arising between 80 and 100 K is assigned to Xe 
desorption from the first Xe layer and shifts with 
decreasing Pt coverage to lower desorption tempera- 
tures. The presence of a single desorption peak from 
the first Xe layer (even for submonolayer coverages; 
not shown here) suggests that platinum is uniformly 
(dispers) distributed in the Cu surface. Otherwise 
there should be two desorption maxima relating to 
Xe desorption from Pt and Cu patches. The Xe

213 
desorption temperature reflects only the average 
composition of the surface in the direct vicinity of 
the Xe adsorption site. With decreasing Pt coverage 
in the surface the number of nearest platinum neigh- 
bours for a Xe atom decreases and thus, the weaker 
Xe-Cu interaction becomes increasingly dominant. 
This trend is displayed in Fig. lb. Due to the de- 
creasing Pt coverage on the Cu(lll) surface the 
position of the Xe TD maximum shifts to lower 
temperatures. Using a simple Redhead analysis [13] 
and the same pre-exponential factor as for the pure 
Xe/Cu(111) system, the peak position converts into 
a linear decrease of the desorption energy from 27 to 
22 kJ/mol. 
Fig. lb shows the calculated Xe desorption ener- 
gies in comparison with those from deposited, unan- 
nealed Pt films on Cu(111). The deviation between 
both data can be explained by the difference in the 
surface morphology. Xe adsorption on the surface 
alloys reflects the average Pt composition in the first 
Cu layer and correspondingly the desorption energy 
shifts linearly with the Pt concentration. For Pt films 
on Cu the adlayer grows pseudomorphically on 
Cu(lll) and at the beginning the Pt atoms are

dispersly distributed on the surface [9,14]. As a 
consequence the Xe atoms will be physisorbed at the 
Pt cluster and island boundaries, i.e. steps, and their 
desorption energy will be accordingly higher [15]. 
Likewise the average desorption temperature for the 
Xe atoms is increased, compared to the annealed 
surface alloys. From Xe adsorption experiments one 
can conclude, that it is possible to produce different 
Cu/Pt surface alloys by heating a 2 ML Pt film on 
Cu(111) to different temperatures above 500 K. The 
surface of the alloys turns out to be nearly flat 
because the Xe desorption energy shows no signifi- 
cant deviation from a linear dependence on the Pt 
coverage as measured for dispersed Pt films on 
Cu(111) [9]. 
3.2. CO adsorption on Pt / Cu(111) surface alloys 
Thermal CO desorption spectra obtained from 
Pt/Cu(111) surface alloys with different Pt concen- 
trations after adsorption of different amounts of CO 
at 90 K are depicted in Fig. 2. For each set of CO 
spectra a new Pt/Cu surface alloy was prepared by 
deposition of 2 ML Pt on Cu(111) and followed by 
heating to increasing temperatures above 500 K. No 
change of the surface composition was detected dur- 
ing the CO TDS measurements because the surface 
was not heated above 500 K. 
Three regions are known from CO TDS experi- 
ments on dispersed Pt-films on Cu(lll) [9]. The 
peaks showing up between 100 and 200 K retain the 
positions as those observed on the clean Cu(lll) 
surface and, hence, can be associated to CO desorp- 
tion from Cu sites. A second region located between 
300 and 500 K can be attributed to CO desorption 
from Pt sites as it is known from the pure Pt(111) 
surface [16]. The intensity between 200 and 300 K 
may then be assigned to CO desorption from mixed 
Cu-Pt sites. With this knowledge it is possible to 
explain the CO TD spectra in Fig. 2. 
For the highest Pt coverage (2 ML Pt) the TD 
spectra have nearly the same shape and the same 
desorption energy as from a pure Pt(111) substrate; a 
significant amount of defects can be clearly ex- 
cluded. Thus, we take the deviations as an indication 
for a different electronic structure of the platinum 
film compared to pure Pt(ill). After heating to 
580 K the Pt concentration in the topmost layer is

detectedto be 75% and an unstructured broad CO 
desorption peak appears due to desorption from Pt 
and mixed Cu-Pt adsorption sites. Below a Pt con- 
centration of 50% the TD peak splits into two peaks 
which can be attributed to Cu- and Pt-like positions; 
the mixed sites have nearly disappeared. By further 
heating to higher temperatures, depending on the Pt 
concentration in the Cu substrate the CO amount 
desorbing from Pt sites is decreasing, while accord- 
ingly the intensity from Cu sites increases with 
higher Cu concentration. The reason for the lack of 
mixed Cu-Pt CO adsorption sites at low Pt concen- 
trations on the surface can be explained by a geomet- 
rical effect. CO adsorbs first on Pt positions [17,18] 
and consequently due to the repulsive CO-CO inter- 
action all surrounding Cu-Pt sites are blocked by the 
COpt molecules. For Pt concentrations above 65% 
the Pt atoms may change the electronic structure of 
the surface as a whole and accordingly mixed sites 
can be populated. One can also conclude from the 
high number of CO molecules adsorbed on mixed 
sites for high Pt concentrations, that the Pt is dif-

215 
fused into the first Cu(111) layer, because for sub- 
monolayers of Pt on Cu(111) only a smaller number 
of CO adsorption sites on mixed Cu-Pt positions are 
found [9]. Furthermore a TD peak shift of the small- 
est CO coverage (0.1 ML) from 460 K at 2 ML 
Pt/Cu(lll) to 390 K for 10% Pt in the topmost 
Cu(111) layer can be noted. Using again a Redhead 
analysis and the pre-exponential factor as for 
CO/Pt(lll) (1,= 1 × 1013 Hz), these peak maxi- 
mum temperatures convert into a decrease of the CO 
desorption energy from 115 k 
J/tool for 2 ML 
Pt/Cu(111) to 100 kJ/mol for 10% Pt. Note, that 
for the 2 ML film on Cu(111) the CO desorption 
energy is already lower than on the pure Pt(lll) 
surface (E 
d = 134 kJ/mol [19]). 
HREELS measurements show the same trend as 
the TDS experiments. The intensity ratio Ioss/Ieat 
of the intramolecular CO stretching frequency for the 
ontop position on Cu ( 2077 cm-1) and on Pt 
( 2100 cm -) is presented in Fig. 3a as obtained 
after deconvolution of the HREEL spectrum. With 
decreasing Pt coverage the intensity of this CO loss 
feature from the Pt sites decreases, while that of CO 
from the Cu sites rises correspondingly. Remarkable 
is the intensity ratio of bridge (both ,--- 1850 cm -1 ) 
to ontop positions on Cu and Pt, respectively, which 
has a minimum at a Pt concentration of 20%. This 
intensity ratio together with the same ratio for CO on 
unannealed Pt films on Cu(111) is presented in Fig. 
3b. The minimum can again be explained by the 
morphology of the Pt films on the Cu substrate. The 
CO TDS from both surfaces (annealed and unan- 
nealed) shows no CO desorption from mixed Cu-Pt 
sites. As already mentioned above in both the Pt/Cu 
surface alloys and the Pt films on the Cu(111) 
substrate the Pt atoms are dispersed. Accordingly at 
a Pt concentration of 20% the CO molecules have 
only a small probability to adsorb on Cu bridge 
positions between the dispersed Pt atoms. Further- 
more Pt islands are not large enough for CO 
molecules to bond in Pt bridge sites. With increasing 
Pt coverage on the surface, however, the island size 
increases and the number of possible Pt-bridge posi- 
tions rises accordingly. The CO TD spectra of the 
Pt/Cu surface alloys show a higher number of mixed 
Cu-Pt sites between 25 and 75% Pt concentration. 
The desorption must therefore originate from higher 
coordinated adsorption sites than ontop positions,

thus, the number of bridge sites in the HREEL 
spectrum is increased. This corresponds to the devia-

Fig. 4 finally shows the  
work function change 
measured during CO adsorption at 90 K on Pt/Cu 
surface alloys with different concentrations of Pt 
prepared by annealing 2 ML Pt/Cu(111) to increas- 
ing temperatures above 500 K. For a Pt film of 2 ML 
on Cu(111) the decrease in the work function can be 
correlated with the HREELS measurements, and thus 
corresponds to a population of ontop sites on Pt. The 
following reincrease is attributed to CO adsorption 
on bridge positions [20]. Comparing this curve with 
work function changes in the Pt concentration range 
from 30-60% it can be observed that the increase 
after passing the minimum becomes smaller and a 
second shallow minimum follows. The first decrease 
and reincrease of the A b curve can be explained by 
a population of Pt ontop and bridge sites. After 
saturation of all Pt positions a second decrease in the

500 K Pt atoms diffuse into the Cu(lll) bulk, thus, 
it is possible to produce different surface alloys by 
heating 2 ML Pt/Cu(lll) to increasing tempera- 
tures. The topmost layer consists of dispersed Pt 
atoms in a Cu matrix and Xe adsorpfion/desorption 
can be used as a probe for the PtCu composition of 
the surface. CO adsorbs first on Pt sites before 
populating mixed Cu-Pt and Cu positions. The CO 
adsorption on bridge sites at small Pt concentrations 
is reduced because of the dispers distribution of the 
Pt atoms in the Cu matrix. At higher Pt concentra- 
tions a high number of Pt-Cu mixed sites are found 
in contrast to deposited Pt films on the Cu(lll) 
surface. The adsorption energy of CO on Pt atoms 
embedded in the Cu matrix is reduced by up to 25% 
compared to pure Pt(111).
