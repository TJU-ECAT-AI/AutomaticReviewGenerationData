[1] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

[2] "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Pt monolayer on Ni(111), is conducted using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These methods reveal that the Pt overlayer is stressed and in epitaxy with the Ni substrate. This characterization is crucial for structural modeling, as demonstrated by the use of a 62-atom, 4-layer cluster to represent the metallic substrate in this study. 

Understanding the structure of these bimetallic surfaces is essential for accurate DFT calculations and for comprehensively analyzing their electronic and chemical properties. This knowledge is vital in advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows researchers to predict and explain the unique behaviors of these bimetallic systems, which often differ significantly from their pure metal components in terms of catalytic and chemisorptive properties.

通过在Ni(111)上沉积Pt单层来合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是使用低能电子衍射和X射线光电子能谱等技术进行的。这些方法揭示了Pt覆盖层受到应力并与Ni基底呈外延关系。这种表征对结构建模至关重要，正如本研究中使用62原子、4层集群来代表金属基底所证明的那样。

理解这些双金属表面的结构对于准确的DFT计算以及全面分析它们的电子和化学性质至关重要。这种知识在先进的表面科学和催化研究中是至关重要的，因为它允许研究人员预测和解释这些双金属系统的独特行为，这些行为在催化和化学吸附性质方面通常与其纯金属成分有显著不同。
