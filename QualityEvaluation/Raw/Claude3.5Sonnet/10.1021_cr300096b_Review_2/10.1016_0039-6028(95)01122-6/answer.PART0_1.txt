[1] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

[2] "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

[3] "The electronic structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states (LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These methods reveal that the Pt monolayer on Ni(111) is stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate. This characterization is crucial for structural modeling because it provides the basis for creating accurate representations of the bimetallic surface, such as the 62-atom, 4-layer cluster used in this study. The information gained from characterization also informs DFT calculations and allows for analysis of the electronic structure through methods like local density of states (LDOS). This comprehensive approach combining experimental characterization with theoretical modeling is essential for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which is critical for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过低能电子衍射和X射线光电子能谱等技术进行的。这些方法揭示了Ni(111)上的Pt单层是应力的并与基底呈外延关系。这种表征对结构建模至关重要，因为它为创建双金属表面的精确表示提供了基础，例如本研究中使用的62原子、4层集群模型。从表征获得的信息也为密度泛函理论(DFT)计算提供依据，并允许通过局部态密度(LDOS)等方法分析电子结构。这种将实验表征与理论建模相结合的综合方法对于理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究是至关重要的。
