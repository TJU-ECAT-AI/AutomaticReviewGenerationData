[1] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

[2] "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

[3] "The electronic structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states (LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Pt monolayer on Ni(111), is conducted using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These methods reveal that the Pt overlayer is stressed and in epitaxy with the Ni substrate. This characterization is crucial for structural modeling, as it allows researchers to create accurate representations of the surface, such as the 62-atom, 4-layer cluster used in this study. 

The characterization also enables detailed analysis of the electronic structure through methods like examining the atomic local density of states (LDOS) for both hydrogen and substrate atoms. This comprehensive understanding of the geometric and electronic properties is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it provides insight into how the bimetallic surface's structure influences its chemical and catalytic properties. Such knowledge is fundamental for designing and optimizing catalysts for various applications.

通过在Ni(111)上沉积Pt单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过低能电子衍射和X射线光电子能谱等技术进行的。这些方法揭示Pt覆盖层是应力的，并与Ni基底呈外延关系。这种表征对结构建模至关重要，因为它允许研究人员创建表面的精确表示，例如本研究中使用的62原子、4层簇模型。

表征还能够通过诸如检查氢原子和基底原子的原子局部态密度(LDOS)等方法对电子结构进行详细分析。这种对几何和电子性质的全面理解对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它提供了双金属表面结构如何影响其化学和催化性质的见解。这种知识对于设计和优化各种应用的催化剂是基础性的。
