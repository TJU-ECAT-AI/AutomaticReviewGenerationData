[1] "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydrocarbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."

[2] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

[3] "Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure for monoatomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system. A comparison with the monometallic H/Pt(111) and H/Ni(111) cases was made."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is typically conducted using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These methods help determine the structural properties of the Pt monolayer on Ni(111), revealing that the overlayer is stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate. 

This characterization process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it provides essential information about the surface geometry and electronic structure of the bimetallic system. Understanding these properties is fundamental for accurately modeling and predicting the behavior of these surfaces in various applications.

The comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces is important in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By comparing the bimetallic system with pure Pt and Ni surfaces, researchers can investigate how the combination of these metals affects properties such as chemisorption strength for molecules like hydrogen and hydrocarbons. This knowledge is valuable for developing more efficient catalysts and understanding the unique properties that emerge from bimetallic systems.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常使用低能电子衍射（LEED）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）等技术进行。这些方法有助于确定Ni(111)上Pt单层的结构特性，揭示覆盖层处于应力状态并与基底呈外延关系。

这一表征过程对结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算至关重要，因为它提供了有关双金属系统表面几何和电子结构的基本信息。了解这些性质对于准确建模和预测这些表面在各种应用中的行为至关重要。

在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下，全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质非常重要。通过将双金属系统与纯Pt和Ni表面进行比较，研究人员可以调查这些金属的组合如何影响氢气和碳氢化合物等分子的化学吸附强度等性质。这些知识对于开发更高效的催化剂和理解双金属系统中出现的独特性质非常有价值。
