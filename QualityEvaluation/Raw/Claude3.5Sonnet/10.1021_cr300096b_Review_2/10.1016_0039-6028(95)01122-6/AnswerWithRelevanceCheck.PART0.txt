          "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

          "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

          "The electronic structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states (LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms."

          "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydrocarbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."

          "Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure for monoatomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system. A comparison with the monometallic H/Pt(111) and H/Ni(111) cases was made."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Pt monolayer on Ni(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These methods reveal that the Pt overlayer is stressed and in epitaxy with the Ni substrate. This characterization is crucial for structural modeling, as demonstrated by the use of a 62-atom, 4-layer cluster to represent the metallic substrate in this study.

          The characterization process is essential for accurate DFT calculations and comprehensive analysis of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It enables detailed examination of the electronic structure through methods like analyzing the atomic local density of states (LDOS) for both hydrogen and substrate atoms. 

          This comprehensive approach combining experimental characterization with theoretical modeling is crucial in advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows researchers to investigate how the combination of Pt and Ni affects properties such as chemisorption strength for molecules like hydrogen and hydrocarbons, compare the bimetallic system with pure Pt and Ni surfaces, and understand the unique properties that emerge from bimetallic systems. This knowledge is fundamental for designing and optimizing catalysts for various applications and predicting the behavior of these surfaces in different scenarios.

          通过在Ni(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Pt单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是使用低能电子衍射（LEED）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）等技术进行的。这些方法揭示Pt覆盖层是应力的，并与Ni基底呈外延关系。这种表征对结构建模至关重要，正如本研究中使用62原子、4层簇来代表金属基底所证明的那样。

          表征过程对于准确的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和全面分析这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。它能够通过诸如分析氢原子和基底原子的原子局部态密度（LDOS）等方法对电子结构进行详细检查。

          这种将实验表征与理论建模相结合的综合方法在先进的表面科学和催化研究中至关重要。它允许研究人员调查Pt和Ni的组合如何影响氢气和碳氢化合物等分子的化学吸附强度等性质，将双金属系统与纯Pt和Ni表面进行比较，并理解从双金属系统中出现的独特性质。这些知识对于设计和优化各种应用的催化剂以及预测这些表面在不同情况下的行为是基础性的。
