[1] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer. The corresponding results attained with low energy electron diffraction [3] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [4] indicate that this overlayer seems stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate."

[2] "A cluster of 62 atoms (4 layers) was used to represent the metallic substrate, where Pt is in epitaxy with the Ni(111) surface (see Fig. 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These methods reveal that the Pt monolayer on Ni(111) is stressed and in epitaxy with the substrate. This characterization is crucial for structural modeling, as it allows researchers to create accurate representations of the surface, such as the 62-atom, 4-layer cluster used in this study. The structural information obtained from characterization also enables more precise DFT calculations and analysis of the electronic structure through methods like local density of states (LDOS). This comprehensive approach combining experimental characterization with theoretical modeling is essential for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which is critical for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
