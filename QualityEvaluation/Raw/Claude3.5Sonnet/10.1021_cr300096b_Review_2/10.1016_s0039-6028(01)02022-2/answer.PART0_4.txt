The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) substrates is primarily conducted using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These techniques are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

LEED is used to study the surface structure and growth mode of Ni films on Pt(111). It provides information on the structural phases and their evolution with increasing Ni coverage. The intensity of LEED spots is measured using a computer-controlled image processor, allowing for the determination of the number of layers in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth.

AES is employed to analyze the chemical composition of the surface and monitor the Ni coverage. It helps in studying the growth mode of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(111) at room temperature and provides information on the relative evolution of Ni and Pt signals.

The combination of LEED and AES allows researchers to gain comprehensive insights into the structural and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for developing accurate structural models, performing DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties that are crucial for catalysis applications.

Additionally, the coverage of Ni is double-checked using a quartz balance thickness monitor, ensuring accurate measurement of the deposited Ni layers. This precise characterization is vital for establishing structure-property relationships and optimizing the performance of Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要使用低能电子衍射(LEED)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)。这些技术对于结构建模、密度泛函理论(DFT)计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。

LEED用于研究Ni薄膜在Pt(111)上的表面结构和生长模式。它提供了结构相及其随Ni覆盖率增加而演变的信息。LEED斑点的强度通过计算机控制的图像处理器测量，允许确定分子束外延(MBE)生长中的层数。

AES用于分析表面的化学成分和监测Ni覆盖率。它有助于研究Ni超薄膜在室温下在Pt(111)上的生长模式，并提供Ni和Pt信号相对演变的信息。

LEED和AES的结合使研究人员能够全面了解Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构和化学性质。这些信息对于开发精确的结构模型、进行DFT计算以及理解对催化应用至关重要的电子和化学性质至关重要。

此外，Ni的覆盖率通过石英天平厚度监测器进行双重检查，确保对沉积的Ni层进行准确测量。这种精确的表征对于建立结构-性能关系和优化Ni/Pt双金属催化剂的性能至关重要。
