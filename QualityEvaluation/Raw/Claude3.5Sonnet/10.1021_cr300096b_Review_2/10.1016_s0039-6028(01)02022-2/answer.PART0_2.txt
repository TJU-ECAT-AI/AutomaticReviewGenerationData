The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) substrates, is primarily conducted using Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

LEED is used to study the structural evolution and phase changes of the Ni films at different coverages, providing information about the surface structure and symmetry. The oscillation of LEED intensity helps measure the number of layers during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth.

AES is employed to study the growth mode of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(111) at room temperature, monitor the coverage of Ni, and investigate alloy formation at different coverages and temperatures. This technique provides information about the chemical composition of the surface and helps track the interdiffusion process during alloy formation.

These characterization methods are essential because they allow researchers to:

1. Determine the growth mode and structural phases of Ni on Pt(111) at various coverages.
2. Investigate the formation of surface alloys and their dependence on temperature and coverage.
3. Understand the interdiffusion process and its barriers.
4. Provide experimental data for structural modeling and DFT calculations.

By combining these techniques, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the Ni/Pt bimetallic system's structural, electronic, and chemical properties, which is crucial for developing more efficient catalysts and advancing surface science research.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要是使用低能电子衍射(LEED)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)进行的。这些技术对于结构建模、密度泛函理论(DFT)计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。

LEED用于研究不同覆盖度下Ni薄膜的结构演变和相变，提供有关表面结构和对称性的信息。LEED强度的振荡有助于测量分子束外延(MBE)生长期间的层数。

AES用于研究Ni超薄膜在室温下在Pt(111)上的生长模式，监测Ni的覆盖度，并在不同覆盖度和温度下研究合金的形成。该技术提供了有关表面化学成分的信息，并有助于跟踪合金形成过程中的相互扩散过程。

这些表征方法至关重要，因为它们允许研究人员：

1. 确定Ni在Pt(111)上在各种覆盖度下的生长模式和结构相。
2. 研究表面合金的形成及其对温度和覆盖度的依赖性。
3. 了解相互扩散过程及其障碍。
4. 为结构建模和DFT计算提供实验数据。

通过结合这些技术，研究人员可以全面了解Ni/Pt双金属系统的结构、电子和化学性质，这对于开发更高效的催化剂和推进表面科学研究至关重要。
