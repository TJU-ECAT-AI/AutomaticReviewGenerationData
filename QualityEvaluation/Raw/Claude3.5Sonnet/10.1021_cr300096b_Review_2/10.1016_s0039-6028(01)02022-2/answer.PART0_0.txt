The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) substrates, is primarily conducted using Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques are crucial for several reasons:

1. Structural analysis: LEED provides information about the surface structure and ordering of the Ni layers on Pt(111). It helps identify different structural phases and their evolution with increasing Ni coverage.

2. Growth mode determination: AES is used to study the growth mode of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(111). It helps determine whether the growth follows a layer-by-layer, island, or mixed mode.

3. Layer thickness measurement: LEED intensity oscillations are used to measure the number of Ni layers grown on the Pt substrate, providing precise control over film thickness.

4. Alloy formation investigation: AES is employed to study the formation of NiPt alloys at different coverages and temperatures, giving insights into the interdiffusion processes.

These characterization methods are crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because they provide accurate experimental data on the atomic arrangement, growth patterns, and alloy formation in the Ni/Pt system. This information is essential for creating realistic models for theoretical studies and validating computational results.

Furthermore, these techniques contribute to our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces by revealing how the surface structure evolves with coverage and temperature. This knowledge is vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps explain the unique catalytic properties of Ni/Pt systems and guides the design of more efficient catalysts for various applications.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要使用低能电子衍射(LEED)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)。这些技术之所以至关重要，原因如下：

1. 结构分析：LEED提供了关于Ni层在Pt(111)上的表面结构和排列信息。它有助于识别不同的结构相及其随Ni覆盖率增加的演变。

2. 生长模式确定：AES用于研究Ni超薄膜在Pt(111)上的生长模式。它有助于确定生长是否遵循层层生长、岛状生长或混合模式。

3. 层厚度测量：LEED强度振荡用于测量在Pt基底上生长的Ni层数，从而精确控制薄膜厚度。

4. 合金形成研究：AES用于研究不同覆盖率和温度下NiPt合金的形成，提供了有关相互扩散过程的见解。

这些表征方法对结构建模和密度泛函理论(DFT)计算至关重要，因为它们提供了关于Ni/Pt系统中原子排列、生长模式和合金形成的准确实验数据。这些信息对于创建理论研究的真实模型和验证计算结果至关重要。

此外，这些技术通过揭示表面结构如何随覆盖率和温度演变，有助于我们全面理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质。这些知识对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它有助于解释Ni/Pt系统独特的催化性能，并指导设计更高效的催化剂用于各种应用。
