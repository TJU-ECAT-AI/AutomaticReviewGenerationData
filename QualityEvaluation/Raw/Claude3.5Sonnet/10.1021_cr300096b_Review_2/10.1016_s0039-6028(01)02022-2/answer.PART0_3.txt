The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing Ni monolayers on Pt(111) substrates is primarily conducted using Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). These techniques are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

LEED is used to study the structural evolution and phase changes of the Ni films at different coverages, providing information on surface structure and ordering. The oscillation of LEED intensity helps measure the number of layers in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth.

AES is employed to study the growth mode of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(111) at room temperature, monitor the coverage of Ni, and investigate alloy formation. The Auger signals provide information on the chemical composition of the surface and the diffusion of Ni atoms into the Pt bulk during alloy formation.

These characterization methods are essential because they provide detailed information about the growth mode, structural phases, and alloy formation process of Ni on Pt(111). This information is crucial for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which in turn help researchers understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Such understanding is fundamental in advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it allows for the design and optimization of catalysts with specific properties for various applications.

通过在Pt(111)衬底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征主要是使用低能电子衍射(LEED)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)进行的。这些技术对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。

LEED用于研究不同覆盖度下Ni薄膜的结构演变和相变，提供表面结构和有序性的信息。LEED强度的振荡有助于测量分子束外延(MBE)生长中的层数。

AES用于研究室温下Ni超薄膜在Pt(111)上的生长模式，监测Ni的覆盖度，并研究合金的形成。俄歇信号提供了表面化学成分和Ni原子在合金形成过程中向Pt体相扩散的信息。

这些表征方法是必不可少的，因为它们提供了关于Ni在Pt(111)上的生长模式、结构相和合金形成过程的详细信息。这些信息对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，进而帮助研究人员理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质。这种理解在先进的表面科学和催化研究中是基础性的，因为它允许设计和优化具有特定性质的催化剂，以用于各种应用。
