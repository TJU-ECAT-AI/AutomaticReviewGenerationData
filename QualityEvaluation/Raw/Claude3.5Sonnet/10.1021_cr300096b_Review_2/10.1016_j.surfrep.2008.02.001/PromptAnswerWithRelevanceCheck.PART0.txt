[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "Comparing to AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates is conducted through several key techniques:

1. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD): This is the primary method used to deposit Ni onto Pt(111) surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, which is crucial for surface science studies.

2. Temperature-controlled deposition: The structure of the bimetallic surface (surface or subsurface Ni) is controlled by the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing. For example, deposition at 300 K produces a NiPt(111) surface monolayer, while deposition at 600 K or post-annealing to 600 K results in a PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): These techniques are used for elemental analysis and quantification of the bimetallic surface composition.

4. Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy: This technique is particularly sensitive to the elemental composition of the topmost layer of the bimetallic surface.

This characterization process is crucial because it allows researchers to precisely control and understand the structure of the bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which in turn provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The ability to create well-defined bimetallic structures and characterize them thoroughly is fundamental to advancing our understanding of surface science and catalysis, enabling the development of more efficient catalysts and materials.

3. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)：这些技术用于元素分析和双金属表面组成的定量。

4. 低能离子散射(LEIS)能谱：这种技术对双金属表面最外层的元素组成特别敏感。

[1] "As discussed earlier in Section 2.3, depending on the temperature of the Pt(111) substrate during or after the deposition of one monolayer Ni, the resulting surfaces can be described as either the NiPt(111) surface monolayer or the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer."

[2] "As shown earlier in Fig. 13, the desorption temperature from the monolayer NiPt(111) surface is 355 K, slightly higher than that from the Ni(111) film at 311 K."

[3] "Fig. 26 (a) shows the AES measurements of oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni from PtNiPt(111), which were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time."

[4] "Fig. 39 shows the HREELS results following the adsorption of of cyclohexene on Pt(111), Ni(111) and PtNiPt(111). The different spectra are related to the different degree of interations of cyclohexene, as described in the text."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates is conducted using various surface science techniques:

1. Temperature-dependent deposition: The structure (surface NiPt(111) or subsurface PtNiPt(111)) is controlled by the substrate temperature during or after Ni deposition.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): Used to measure desorption temperatures of adsorbates like hydrogen, which differ between NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) structures.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Employed to monitor surface composition changes, such as Ni segregation in the presence of oxygen.

4. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): Utilized to study the vibrational spectra of adsorbed molecules like cyclohexene, revealing differences in adsorption behavior between Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces and pure metal surfaces.

This comprehensive characterization is crucial because:

1. It allows precise determination of the bimetallic surface structure, which is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations.

2. It provides experimental data on electronic properties and adsorption behavior, which can be compared with and validate DFT predictions.

3. It reveals how the bimetallic surface structure influences chemical properties, such as adsorption strengths and reactivity towards different molecules.

4. It helps understand the stability and dynamic behavior of these surfaces under different conditions (e.g., temperature, presence of adsorbates).

By combining these experimental techniques with DFT calculations, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is vital for advancing surface science and designing more effective catalysts for various applications.
