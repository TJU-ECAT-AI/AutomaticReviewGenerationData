[1] "As shown earlier in Section 2.2, the monolayer surface Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, indicating that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is thermodynamically more stable than the surface NiPt(111) structure in vacuum, i.e. without adsorbates on either surface."

[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "Comparing to the AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "Fig. 4 shows an example of the LEIS results following Ni deposition on Pt(111) at 300 K, using He+ ions with an energy of 1 keV as the ion source. The spectrum clearly shows that scattering from Ni and Pt atoms on the surface is easily distinguishable."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using several complementary techniques:

1. Temperature-controlled deposition: Ni is deposited on Pt(111) at specific temperatures (e.g., 300K or 600K) to control whether Ni forms a surface or subsurface layer.

2. Annealing studies: Post-deposition annealing is used to induce diffusion of surface Ni into the subsurface region.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): These techniques provide elemental analysis and quantification of surface composition.

4. Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy: This method is particularly sensitive to the topmost layer composition, allowing clear distinction between surface and subsurface Ni.

5. Structural characterization: Techniques like LEED (not explicitly mentioned for Ni/Pt but implied) are likely used to confirm surface structure.

This comprehensive characterization is crucial because:

1. It allows precise control and verification of the Ni/Pt surface structure (surface vs. subsurface Ni).
2. It provides essential input for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations.
3. It enables correlation of electronic and chemical properties with specific surface structures.
4. It helps bridge the gap between idealized models and real catalytic surfaces.

Understanding these structural details is fundamental for explaining and predicting the unique electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advancing surface science and developing improved catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过几种互补的技术进行的：

1. 温度控制沉积：在特定温度下（如300K或600K）将Ni沉积在Pt(111)上，以控制Ni形成表面层还是亚表面层。

2. 退火研究：使用沉积后退火来诱导表面Ni扩散到亚表面区域。

3. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）：这些技术提供元素分析和表面成分定量。

4. 低能离子散射（LEIS）能谱：这种方法对最表层成分特别敏感，允许清晰区分表面和亚表面Ni。

5. 结构表征：可能使用诸如LEED（虽然没有明确提到Ni/Pt，但暗示使用）等技术来确认表面结构。

这种全面的表征至关重要，因为：

1. 它允许精确控制和验证Ni/Pt表面结构（表面vs.亚表面Ni）。
2. 它为准确的结构建模和DFT计算提供必要输入。
3. 它能够将电子和化学性质与特定表面结构相关联。
4. 它有助于弥合理想模型和实际催化表面之间的差距。

理解这些结构细节对于解释和预测Ni/Pt双金属表面的独特电子和化学性质至关重要，这对于推进表面科学和开发改进的催化剂是必不可少的。
