[1] "Typical methods to deposit a metal overlayer can be separated into three main categories of deposition: physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). Due to the surface science nature of this review, the focus will be on the PVD methods, which are more compatible with the UHV environment necessary for surface science studies."

[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "Comparing to AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates is conducted through several key techniques:

1. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD): This is the primary method used to deposit Ni onto Pt(111) surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, which is crucial for surface science studies.

2. Temperature-controlled deposition: The structure of the bimetallic surface (surface or subsurface Ni) is controlled by the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing. For example, deposition at 300 K produces a NiPt(111) surface monolayer, while deposition at 600 K or post-annealing to 600 K results in a PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): These techniques are used for elemental analysis and quantification of the bimetallic surface composition.

4. Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy: This technique is particularly sensitive to the elemental composition of the topmost layer of the bimetallic surface.

This characterization process is crucial because it allows researchers to precisely control and understand the structure of the bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which in turn provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The ability to create well-defined bimetallic structures and characterize them thoroughly is fundamental to advancing our understanding of surface science and catalysis, enabling the development of more efficient catalysts and materials.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过几种关键技术进行的：

1. 物理气相沉积(PVD)：这是在超高真空(UHV)条件下将Ni沉积到Pt(111)表面的主要方法，这对表面科学研究至关重要。

2. 温度控制沉积：双金属表面的结构（表面或亚表面Ni）通过沉积温度或沉积后退火来控制。例如，在300 K下沉积产生NiPt(111)表面单层，而在600 K下沉积或退火至600 K会产生PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层。

3. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)：这些技术用于元素分析和双金属表面组成的定量。

4. 低能离子散射(LEIS)能谱：这种技术对双金属表面最外层的元素组成特别敏感。

这个表征过程至关重要，因为它允许研究人员精确控制和理解双金属表面的结构。这些信息对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，而这些计算又能提供这些表面的电子和化学性质的见解。能够创建明确定义的双金属结构并对其进行彻底表征，这对于推进我们对表面科学和催化作用的理解至关重要，使得开发更高效的催化剂和材料成为可能。
