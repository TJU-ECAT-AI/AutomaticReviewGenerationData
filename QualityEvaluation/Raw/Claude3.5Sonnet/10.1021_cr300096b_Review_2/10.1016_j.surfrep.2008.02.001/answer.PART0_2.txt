[1] "Depending on the deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature, the admetal overlayer can either remain at the surface or diffuse into the subsurface region. For example, at a deposition temperature of 300 K monolayer coverage of Ni atoms stay on a Pt(111) substrate to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer. On the other hand, a subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111) is obtained either by deposition at 600 K or by post-annealing the 300 K surface in vacuum to 600 K."

[2] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or XPS photoelectrons is elemental specific, therefore allowing for elemental analysis of the bimetallic surfaces. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "Comparing to AES and XPS techniques, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates is conducted using several complementary surface science techniques:

1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are used for elemental analysis and quantification of surface composition. These techniques are surface-sensitive and provide information on the chemical state of elements present.

2. Low-Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is employed to detect the elemental composition of the topmost surface layer with high sensitivity. This is crucial for distinguishing between surface and subsurface structures.

3. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is utilized to map the surface topography, detect defects, and determine the growth mechanism and morphology of the metal overlayer.

4. The deposition temperature or post-deposition annealing temperature is carefully controlled to produce either surface (NiPt(111)) or subsurface (PtNiPt(111)) structures.

This comprehensive characterization process is crucial because it provides detailed information about the surface structure, composition, and morphology of the bimetallic surfaces. This information is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations, which in turn enable a deeper understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. By correlating the experimental characterization data with theoretical calculations, researchers can gain insights into how the surface structure influences catalytic properties, potentially leading to the design of more efficient catalysts for various applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过几种互补的表面科学技术进行的：

1. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)用于元素分析和表面成分定量。这些技术对表面敏感，可提供存在元素的化学状态信息。

2. 低能离子散射(LEIS)光谱用于高灵敏度检测最外层表面的元素组成。这对于区分表面和亚表面结构至关重要。

3. 扫描隧道显微镜(STM)用于绘制表面地形图，检测缺陷，并确定金属覆盖层的生长机制和形貌。

4. 仔细控制沉积温度或沉积后退火温度，以产生表面(NiPt(111))或亚表面(PtNiPt(111))结构。

这一综合表征过程至关重要，因为它提供了有关双金属表面结构、成分和形态的详细信息。这些信息对于准确的结构建模和密度泛函理论(DFT)计算至关重要，进而能够更深入地理解这些表面的电子和化学性质。通过将实验表征数据与理论计算相关联，研究人员可以深入了解表面结构如何影响催化性能，可能导致为先进表面科学和催化研究中的各种应用设计更高效的催化剂。
