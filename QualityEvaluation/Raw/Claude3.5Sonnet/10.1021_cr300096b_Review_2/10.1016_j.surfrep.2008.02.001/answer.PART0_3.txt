[1] "Depending on the deposition temperature and reaction environment, the admetal in MBS can be in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "As shown earlier in Section 2.3, depending on the temperature of the Pt(111) substrate during or after the deposition of one monolayer Ni, the resulting surfaces can be described as either the NiPt(111) surface monolayer or the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer."

[3] "AES and XPS are surface sensitive techniques, with the sampling depth depending on the kinetic energy of the Auger electrons or photoelectrons. The AES peak-to-peak intensities and XPS peak areas, after being normalized by the relevant sensitivity factors, are often used to quantify the compositions of bimetallic surfaces."

[4] "LEIS spectroscopy is much more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer of bimetallic surfaces."

[5] "STM is very useful in mapping adsorbate on surfaces as well as detecting surface defects. In addition, fluctuations of intensity can sometimes be related to differing atomic elements, which is often useful in determining the growth mechanism of metal overlayer and the morphology of bimetallic surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates is conducted using several complementary techniques:

1. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) are used to quantify the surface composition and determine the growth mode of the Ni overlayer.

2. Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) spectroscopy is employed to detect the elemental composition of the topmost layer, which is crucial for distinguishing between surface and subsurface structures.

3. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is utilized to map the surface morphology, detect defects, and determine the growth mechanism of the Ni overlayer.

4. The deposition temperature is carefully controlled, as it determines whether Ni forms a surface monolayer (NiPt(111)) or diffuses into the subsurface to form a subsurface monolayer (PtNiPt(111)).

This characterization process is crucial because:

1. It provides essential structural information for accurate modeling and DFT calculations.

2. It allows researchers to distinguish between different bimetallic structures (surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, or intermixed surfaces).

3. It enables a comprehensive understanding of how the formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic and chemical properties compared to the parent metals.

4. It helps bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in surface science and catalysis research.

5. It allows for the rational design of bimetallic surfaces with tailored properties for specific catalytic applications.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过几种互补的技术进行的：

1. 俄歇电子能谱(AES)和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)用于量化表面组成并确定Ni覆盖层的生长模式。

2. 低能离子散射(LEIS)能谱用于检测最表层的元素组成，这对于区分表面和亚表面结构至关重要。

3. 扫描隧道显微镜(STM)用于绘制表面形貌图，检测缺陷，并确定Ni覆盖层的生长机制。

4. 沉积温度被仔细控制，因为它决定了Ni是形成表面单层(NiPt(111))还是扩散到亚表面形成亚表面单层(PtNiPt(111))。

这个表征过程之所以重要，是因为：

1. 它为准确的建模和DFT计算提供了必要的结构信息。

2. 它使研究人员能够区分不同的双金属结构(表面单层、亚表面单层或混合表面)。

3. 它能够全面理解双金属表面的形成如何改变了与母体金属相比的电子和化学性质。

4. 它有助于弥合表面科学和催化研究中理论预测和实验观察之间的差距。

5. 它允许为特定催化应用理性设计具有定制性质的双金属表面。
