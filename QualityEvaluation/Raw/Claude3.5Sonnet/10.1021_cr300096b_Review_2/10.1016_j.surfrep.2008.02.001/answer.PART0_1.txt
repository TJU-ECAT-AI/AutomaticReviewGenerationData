[1] "As discussed earlier in Section 2.3, depending on the temperature of the Pt(111) substrate during or after the deposition of one monolayer Ni, the resulting surfaces can be described as either the NiPt(111) surface monolayer or the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer."

[2] "As shown earlier in Fig. 13, the desorption temperature from the monolayer NiPt(111) surface is 355 K, slightly higher than that from the Ni(111) film at 311 K."

[3] "Fig. 26 (a) shows the AES measurements of oxygen-induced segregation of subsurface Ni from PtNiPt(111), which were performed to determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time."

[4] "Fig. 39 shows the HREELS results following the adsorption of of cyclohexene on Pt(111), Ni(111) and PtNiPt(111). The different spectra are related to the different degree of interations of cyclohexene, as described in the text."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) substrates is conducted using various surface science techniques:

1. Temperature-dependent deposition: The structure (surface NiPt(111) or subsurface PtNiPt(111)) is controlled by the substrate temperature during or after Ni deposition.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): Used to measure desorption temperatures of adsorbates like hydrogen, which differ between NiPt(111) and PtNiPt(111) structures.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Employed to monitor surface composition changes, such as Ni segregation in the presence of oxygen.

4. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): Utilized to study the vibrational spectra of adsorbed molecules like cyclohexene, revealing differences in adsorption behavior between Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces and pure metal surfaces.

This comprehensive characterization is crucial because:

1. It allows precise determination of the bimetallic surface structure, which is essential for accurate structural modeling and DFT calculations.

2. It provides experimental data on electronic properties and adsorption behavior, which can be compared with and validate DFT predictions.

3. It reveals how the bimetallic surface structure influences chemical properties, such as adsorption strengths and reactivity towards different molecules.

4. It helps understand the stability and dynamic behavior of these surfaces under different conditions (e.g., temperature, presence of adsorbates).

By combining these experimental techniques with DFT calculations, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This knowledge is vital for advancing surface science and designing more effective catalysts for various applications.

通过在Pt(111)基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过各种表面科学技术进行的：

1. 温度依赖沉积：通过Ni沉积期间或之后的基底温度来控制结构（表面NiPt(111)或亚表面PtNiPt(111)）。

2. 程序升温脱附（TPD）：用于测量吸附物（如氢）的脱附温度，这在NiPt(111)和PtNiPt(111)结构之间有所不同。

3. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：用于监测表面成分的变化，如在氧存在下的Ni偏析。

4. 高分辨电子能量损失谱（HREELS）：用于研究吸附分子（如环己烯）的振动谱，揭示Ni/Pt双金属表面和纯金属表面之间吸附行为的差异。

这种全面的表征至关重要，因为：

1. 它允许精确确定双金属表面结构，这对于准确的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。

2. 它提供了关于电子性质和吸附行为的实验数据，可以与DFT预测进行比较和验证。

3. 它揭示了双金属表面结构如何影响化学性质，如对不同分子的吸附强度和反应性。

4. 它有助于理解这些表面在不同条件下（如温度、吸附物存在）的稳定性和动态行为。

通过将这些实验技术与DFT计算相结合，研究人员可以全面理解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质。这些知识对于推进表面科学和设计更有效的催化剂用于各种应用至关重要。
