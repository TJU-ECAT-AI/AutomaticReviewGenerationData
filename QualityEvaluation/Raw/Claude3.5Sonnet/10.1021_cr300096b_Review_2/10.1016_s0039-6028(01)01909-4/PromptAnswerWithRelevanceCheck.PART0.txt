Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

This document does not contain information about the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. The literature focuses on Pt/Ru bimetallic surfaces, specifically Pt islands deposited on a Ru(001) substrate. It does not discuss Ni monolayers on Pt substrates or their characterization methods. The document primarily describes studies of CO adsorption on Pt/Ru surfaces using infrared spectroscopy and STM imaging to probe surface morphology and binding energies. Without relevant information about Ni/Pt systems, I cannot answer the question as posed.

这篇文献并不包含关于Ni/Pt双金属表面表征的信息。文献主要关注Pt/Ru双金属表面,特别是沉积在Ru(001)衬底上的Pt岛。它没有讨论Pt衬底上的Ni单层或其表征方法。该文档主要描述了使用红外光谱和STM成像研究CO在Pt/Ru表面上的吸附,以探测表面形态和结合能。由于没有关于Ni/Pt系统的相关信息,我无法回答所提出的问题。
