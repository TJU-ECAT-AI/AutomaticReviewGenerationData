Halogen Adsorption on CeO2: The Role of Lewis AcidBase Pairing
Zhenpeng Hu and Horia Metiu*
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106-9510, United States
ABSTRACT: We use density functional theory to examine the dissociation of halogen molecules on CeO2(111). We are
interested in this because oxides are used to catalyze the oxihalogenation of alkanes. Our calculations show that the exothermicity
of the dissociative adsorption is increased substantially if one of the dissociation fragments is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis
base. Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation. Finally, we
show that the presence of a halogen on the oxide surface facilitates the breaking of the CH bond in methane.
1. INTRODUCTION
Numerous papers have pointed out that adding halogens to an
oxide surface often (but not always) improves the catalytic
activity of the oxide toward alkane activation.1 Halogenated
oxide surfaces are also of interest in oxyhalogenation re-
actions,210 and in the destruction of unwanted halogenated
side products.7,1118 In all of these systems, an oxide catalyst is
exposed to a gas that contains oxygen and a halogen source. The
halogen source converts the oxide into the halide, and oxygen
converts the latter into the oxide. Depending on the ratio of the
halogen source to oxygen in the gas, and on the temperature of
the surface, the oxide surface contains a certain amount of
halogen. We call this a halogenated oxide surface. In this Article,
we use density functional theory to perform a preliminary
investigation of the manner in which halogens adsorb on CeO2
surface and the way in which they influence the chemistry of the
surface.
Our most interesting finding is that the chemisorption of
halogens on ceria is controlled by the ability of the halogen
atoms (formed by dissociative adsorption) to function as a
Lewis acidbase pair. A halogen atom can adsorb on ceria on
either an oxygen site (we denote the system formed in this way
by (XO/CeO2(111)) or a Ce site (denoted (XCe)/
CeO2(111)). Here, X denotes a halogen atom. The reactions
1/2X2 + CeO2(111) (XO)/CeO2(111) and 1/2X2 +
CeO2(111) (XCe)/CeO2(111) are both endoergic. One
would therefore be inclined to predict that the reaction X2 +
CeO2(111) (X,X)/CeO2(111), which forms two halogen
atoms adsorbed on the surface, would be even more endoergic.
This is indeed the case if both halogens adsorb on a Ce site, or
both adsorb on an oxygen site. However, the reaction X2 +
CeO2(111) (XO, XCe)/CeO2(111), in which one X
formed by dissociation binds on O and the other X binds on
Ce, is exoergic. Our calculations show that this strong inter-
action between the dissociation fragments occurs because the X
atom bound to O is a Lewis base (electron donor) and the X
atom bound to Ce is a Lewis acid (electron acceptor).
We have seen similar behavior in the coadsorption of a Lewis
acid with a Lewis base on rutile TiO2(110).19 Therefore, we pos-
tulate that this is a general behavior: the coadsorption of a Lewis
base with a Lewis acid, on an oxide surface that is not a strong
acid or base, results in a large stabilization energy (attractive
interaction energy between the acid and the base). This stabi-
lization does not take place because the acid binds chemically to
the base: it is caused by an indirect, through the oxide, interaction.
To test this propensity rule, we have studied the coadsorp-
tion of halogens with other acids or bases. We found that the
presence of a hydroxyl (a Lewis base) forces the halogen to
bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid, and stabilizes con-
siderably the bond of the halogen to the oxide. La-doped CeO2 is
a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O
site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O
site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger
than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in
XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis
acid than the undoped one. Moreover, binding the halogen atom

to the Ce site (of the La-doped ceria) is energetically uphill
because OCe is a Lewis acid and so is the doped oxide. The
acidity of the surface discourages the adsorption of another acid.
Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the penta-
valent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface,
the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond
is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria. The adsorption
on the site where the halogen is a base is uphill.
2. COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY
All calculations reported here were performed with the LDA+U
method,20 with a U value of 5.5 eV for Ce. This method has been
used in previous work to study various properties of ceria.2133
We are interested here only in showing that the interac-
tion between Lewis acids and bases, through the surface, is very
strong. This conclusion is robust because this interaction is
much stronger than the errors expected from the DFT+U
method.
As in previous work,25,3234 we use a p(3 × 3) slab to
simulate the CeO2(111) surface; this has nine atomic layers
(three CeO2 layers) with a total of 81 atoms. The vacuum layer
has 15 Å, and the volume of the supercell is 11.45 × (11.45 ×
(3)/(2)) × 22.79 Å3. All calculations were performed with
the VASP3539 package with PAW40,41 pseudopotential. We
used a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh and a 400 eV energy-cutoff for
plane wave basis set. In geometry optimization, all atoms except
the oxygen atoms in the bottom layer were fully relaxed until
the force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV/Å. The total
energy was considered converged when the energy difference
between two successive iterations was less than 104 eV, for
geometry optimization, or 105 eV for a single-point energy
calculation.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. The Adsorption of a Single Cl Atom. We are inter-
ested in the dissociative adsorption of Cl2, and it is instructive
to compare the energy of this process with the energy of
adsorbing two noninteracting Cl atoms. A Cl atom could bind
on the CeO2(111) surface either on top of an oxygen atom or
on top of a Ce atom. We denote by ClO the Cl atom bound
to oxygen and by ClCe the Cl atom bound to Ce.
The energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2(g) + CeO2 (ClO)/
CeO2 is +0.24 eV (see Tables 1 and 2). The adsorbed Cl atom
is metastable with respect to the recombination of two adsorbed
Cl atoms to form Cl2 in the gas phase.
In this Article, we use what we call the Bader valence (BV): the
number of valence electrons (i.e., those not included in the core)
of the neutral atom in gas, minus the number of electrons on
the atom in the chemical compound of interest. A positive value
means that when forming the compound the atom donates
electrons (it is a Lewis base); negative values mean that the
atom gains electrons (it is a Lewis acid). The number of elec-
trons on an atom within a compound is calculated by the Bader
method42 with the algorithm proposed by Henkelman and
Jonsson.43,44
The ClO bond distance is 1.67 Å, which is the same as the
ClO bond distance in the gas-phase HClO molecule. In what
follows, we will regard the adsorption of a Cl atom on an O site
as the replacement of a surface oxygen atom with a ClO
group. Formally, this is a substitutional anion doping: O is re-
placed with ClO. From the point of view of formal charges,
we replace an O2anion with a ClOanion, and this creates an
electron excess in the oxide because ClO only binds one
electron instead of two. Thus, adsorbing Cl on an oxygen atom
turns the oxide into a Lewis base. We will show later that the
extra electron reduces a Ce4+ ion to Ce3+. We have used here
formal charges to describe the system, with the understanding
that in no system do the ions have the formal charges.
To substantiate the formal picture used above, we have cal-
culated the BV of the atoms involved in the discussion. The BV
of Cl (in ClO) is 0.15 electron. The Cl atom loses elec-
tron charge when it makes the bond, despite its high electro-
negativity. The BV on the oxygen atom in the ClO group
is 0.91 electron. Thus, the net BV on the ClO group
is 0.91 + 0.15 = 0.76 electron. This is very different from the
BV of 1.20 electron, on an oxygen atom in the surface layer
of the clean CeO2 surface. Thus, replacing an O atom with a
ClO group does create an excess of electrons in the rest of the
doped oxide as compared to the case in which no Cl atom is
adsorbed. The upshot is that creating a ClO group on the sur-
face causes an electron excess in the oxide.
To find out where the excess electron goes, we need to ex-
amine the partial density of states (PDOS) of the (ClO)/
CeO2 system (Figure 1a). The state in the gap is a Ce 4f state
(see Figure 1b), which appears because one Ce atom is reduced
when Cl is adsorbed on O. We can view the adsorption of Cl to
form ClO as a two-step process: first, one forms an oxygen
vacancy, and then one adsorbs an OCl group at the vacancy
site. Forming the vacancy leaves behind two unpaired elec-
trons; adsorbing OCl at the vacancy site uses one of them
(to make OCl). The bonding orbital of this group is shown
in Figure 1c. The other unpaired electron reduces a Ce4+ ion to
Ce3+; the orbital in the gap is the one occupied by this electron,
and its shape and location in the oxide are shown in Figure 1b.
Such electrons form polarons,21,27,4548 and the energy of the
system depends on the location of the polaron with respect to
the ClO site. Calculating the energy of the system for differ-
ent polaron locations is outside the scope of this Article. On the
basis of previous work, we know that finding the best location

of the polaron will lower the energy of the final state. For ceria,
this lowering is approximately 0.3 eV.
The energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2 + CeO2(111) (ClCe)/
CeO2(111) is +0.18 eV (Table 1). This state is also metastable
with respect to the recombination of adsorbed Cl and formation
of a gas-phase Cl2 molecule.
The BV of Cl in ClCe is 0.33 electron (compare this
to +0.15 for Cl in ClO); the Cl atom in the ClCe group is a
Lewis acid. The presence of the Cl atom affects an oxygen atom
that is 2.28 Å away; the BV on this oxygen atom is 0.97,
which is smaller that the BV of 1.20 electron on the oxygen
atoms in the surface of pure ceria.
Figure 2a gives the PDOS of (ClCe)/CeO2(111). The sys-
tem has two spin-orbitals in the gap, formed by a combination
of atomic orbitals of Cl and oxygen (in the figure, the Cl and O
densities of states are equal, and because of this only one of
them is seen in the graph). Only one of these two states is
occupied. No Ce atom is reduced when ClCe is formed.
The fact that the Cl atom in the ClCe group is a Lewis acid
and the Cl atom in the ClO group is a Lewis base plays an
important role in what follows.
3.2. The Dissociative Adsorption of Cl2. Because there
are two adsorption sites for each Cl atom, there are three pairs

reaction:

has the highest dissociative adsorption energy, equal to
ΔEad = 0.58 eV (see Table 1). Here (ClCe, ClO)/
CeO2(111) represents the CeO2 slab with a Cl adsorbed on the
oxygen site and another Cl adsorbed on a Ce site. This fairly high
exothermicity is unexpected, because the adsorption of a single Cl
atom is endoergic regardless of the adsorption site (see Table 1).
Therefore, there is a strong interaction between the two Cl
atoms formed by the dissociation of Cl2. We have pointed out
in work on other systems19 that this also happens when a Lewis
acid is coadsorbed on TiO2 with a Lewis base.
We can calculate the interaction energy between the frag-
ments A and B, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the
molecule AB, by using:

Here, Ead[(A,B)/CeO2] is the energy of the CeO2 slab with
both fragments produced by the dissociation adsorbed on it,
and Ead[A/CeO2] is the energy of the CeO2 slab with the
fragment A adsorbed on it (in the absence of B). The meaning
of Ead[B/CeO2] is similar. The interaction energy for the case
when A = ClO and B = ClCe is 1.01 eV (Table 1). Other
definitions of the interaction energy are possible, and they will
differ by an energy that is constant throughout this Article;
therefore, any one of these definitions is acceptable because our
purpose is to compare different dissociation reactions on ceria.
The BV for the Cl atom bound at the Ce site, in (ClO, Cl
Ce)/CeO2, is 0.62 (Table 1), which is nearly twice the value
of the BV for a Cl atom adsorbed alone on the Ce site (which
is 0.33 (Table 1)). The BV value on the Cl atom adsorbed on
an oxygen site, in the compound (ClO, ClCe)/CeO2(111),
is the same as that obtained when Cl adsorbed alone on the
oxygen site. There is, however, a fundamental difference
between (ClO)/CeO2 and (ClO, ClCe)/CeO2. When Cl
adsorbs alone on O, the chlorine atom loses charge and a Ce4+
ion is reduced; Ce4+ is a Lewis acid, and it forces the Cl atom to
behave like a Lewis base. However, on the (ClCe, ClO)/
CeO2 surface, the Cl atom in the ClCe group is a strong
Lewis acid and takes the electron that would have otherwise
gone to reduce Ce4+; therefore, the ClCe group is a stronger
Lewis acid than is the Ce4+ ion.
The PDOS of (ClCe, ClO)/CeO2(111) are shown in
Figure 3. The energies of four spinorbitals are located in the
gap, just above the valence band and below the Fermi level. Iso-
density surfaces of the orbitals having energies above the valence
band are shown in Figure 3b and c; these orbitals are essentially
p-electrons localized on the Cl atoms. The new states formed by
Cl2 dissociation located below the valence band are all related to
the ClO bonds.
We have also examined the possibility that Cl2 dissociates
with both Cl atoms bound at the Ce site. In this case, both
atoms are Lewis bases (if adsorbed alone). The energy of the
reaction:
+

CeO (111)
(Cl Ce, Cl Ce)/CeO (111)

is 0.43 eV, and the interaction energy between the two dis-
sociation fragments is 0.07 eV. In forming the product (ClCe,
ClCe)/CeO2(111), we are trying to coadsorb two Lewis
bases, and the dissociation is no longer helped by the formation
of a Lewis acidbase pair.
Figure 4 gives some information about the (ClCe, ClCe)/
CeO2(111) system. The PDOS in Figure 4 are very similar to the
PDOS in Figure 1a (for ClCe/CeO2(111)). The only differ-
ence is that when there are two ClCe groups on the surface, we
have twice as many states in the gap. The iso-density plot of the
KS orbitals in the gap is similar to the one shown in Figure 1b.
The BVs of 0.31 and 0.32 electron, for the two Cl atoms in
(ClCe, ClCe)/SiO2(111), are almost the same as the value
of 0.33 electron obtained in the case of (ClCe)/CeO2(111).
This is consistent with the fact that the interaction energy of the
two Cl atoms formed by the dissociation of Cl2 to form (ClCe,
ClCe)/CeO2 is practically zero.
3.3. Cl Coadsorption with a Lewis Acid or a Lewis
Base. We have argued so far that (ClO, ClCe)/CeO2(111)
is stable because one Cl atom is a Lewis acid and the other is a
Lewis base. If this is true, the adsorption of Cl on the ceria sur-
face can be manipulated by coadsorption of Cl with a Lewis acid
or a Lewis base. We expect that the presence of a Lewis acid on
the surface will induce the Cl atom to bind strongly to an oxygen
atom where it is a Lewis base; similarly, the presence of a Lewis
base on the surface should drive the Cl atom to bind strongly to
a Ce atom to form a Lewis acid. In this section, we perform cal-
culations to test these expectations.
To create a ceria surface that is a Lewis acid, we dope it sub-
stitutionally with a La atom. This LaCeO2(111) system is
created by removing a Ce atom in the top surface layer and
replacing it with a La atom. Because the trivalent La atom re-
places a tetravalent Ce atom, the doped oxide has a deficit of
electrons; therefore, this system is inclined to gain electrons,
and it is therefore a Lewis acid. In previous work,32,33 we have
shown that doping with La creates a hole in the valence band.
This lowering of the LUMO of the oxide (which is now at the
top of the valence band instead of the bottom of the con-
duction band) means an increase in the strength of the Lewis
acidity of the system. The undoped CeO2 is a weak Lewis acid
because of the tendency21,27 of Ce4+ to be reduced to Ce3+;
doping with La makes CeO2 a much stronger Lewis acid.
We have placed a Cl atom on all possible binding sites on the
LaCeO2 surface and found that the highest energy for the
reaction:
+

2 Cl
LaCeO (111)
(Cl O)/LaCeO (111)

is 1.46 eV. In this final state, the Cl atom binds to an oxygen
atom to form a [ClO]anion, and the Cl atom is an electron
donor (Lewis base). Contrast this with the binding energy
of +0.24 eV when Cl binds to an oxygen atom on the surface of
the undoped ceria. Clearly, the presence of the La dopant in-
creases dramatically the binding energy of the Cl atom and also
guides the atom to bind to an oxygen site where it functions
as a Lewis base.
We have also found that Cl does not bind to any site on the
LaCeO2(111) surface in which it would be an electron acceptor
(Lewis acid). Thus, the acidity of the oxide (created by doping
with La) prevents the adsorption of Cl as a Lewis acid and
stimulates the adsorption of Cl as a Lewis base. Because Cl is a
very electronegative element, one would expect it to act as an
acid (acceptor), but apparently LaCeO2 is a stronger acid than
Cl and Cl is forced to act as a base.
Doping Ce with Ta creates an excess of electrons in the oxide
(Ta is pentavalent), and we expect TaCeO2(111) to be a strong

6667
Lewis base. According to the rule formulated here, this dopant-
induced basicity will force an adsorbed Cl atom to act as a
Lewis acid (electron acceptor). Our calculations show that Cl
adsorbs on TaCeO2(111) on two sites. On one, Cl adsorbs on
an oxygen atom and it is a Lewis base (donor); the binding
energy (i.e., the energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2 + TaCeO2 
(ClO)/LaCeO2) is +0.10 eV. When Cl binds to a Ce atom, it
is a Lewis acid, and the energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2 +
TaCeO2 (ClCe)/LaCeO2) is 1.09 eV. As expected, a
modification that increases the Lewis basicity of the surface will
help a Lewis acid to bind more strongly.
It is interesting to note that in previous work32 we have
shown that in Ta-doped ceria the Ta dopant loses an electron,
which is transferred to a Ce4+ ion (which is reduced to Ce3+).
In this case, Ce4+ acts as an acid. However, when Cl is adsorbed
on the TaCeO2 surface, Cl is a stronger acid than Ce4+, and as a
result the electron provided by Ta is used to bind more strongly
the Cl atom; we see no reduction of a Ce ion when Cl is
adsorbed on a Ce site.
A further test of the idea that a Lewis acidbase interaction
plays an important role in chemisorption on oxides was
performed as follows. A H atom tends to donate electrons to an
oxide when it adsorbs to make a hydroxyl,19,49 and it is
therefore a Lewis base. The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 +
CeO2(111) H/CeO2(111) is 1.24 eV (Table 3). The
energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + 1/2Cl2 + CeO2(111)(HO,
ClO)/CeO2(111) is 1.16 eV (Table 3). In the final state, Cl
adsorbs on the O atom and is a Lewis base; the BV for the Cl

atom is 0.11 electron, just like the case when the Cl is adsorbed
alone. Coadsorbing two Lewis bases does not lead to any
substantial interaction between adsorbates. However, the
energy of the reaction 1/2Cl2 + 1/2H2 (HO, ClCe)/
CeO2(111) is 2.01 eV; the interaction energy between H and
Cl is 0.96 eV; and the BV of Cl is 0.64 electron. Again, the
presence of H, which is a Lewis base, induces the Cl atom to act
as a Lewis acid, increases the binding energy of Cl, and dictates
the binding site (Cl binds to Ce not to O).
4. BR ADSORPTION ON CEO2(111)
If the model proposed here is correct, we should observe the
same behavior when we adsorb Br. Indeed, we do. The results
of the calculations are collected in Table 4. The trends and their
interpretation are the same as for Cl, but the numerical values
of the reaction energies and the BVs of the adsorbates are
different, as expected. The Lewis acidbase interaction in this
system is weaker than in the case of chlorine, because Br is a
weaker Lewis acid than Cl.
5. POSSIBLE APPLICATION TO ALKANE COUPLING
This acidbase model suggests that a halogenated ceria surface
(i.e., a ceria surface on which we have adsorbed a halogen at
low coverage) may be more favorable for alkane activation than
the clean ceria. We consider here the possibility that methane
interacts with a halogenated surface and produces a CH3 radical
in the gas phase and an adsorbed H atom. Because the H atom

energy of reaction on pure ceria, which is 1.67 eV (Table 5). If
we preadsorb Br2 to form BrCe on the surface, the energy of
the methane dissociation reaction is +0.97 eV (Table 5). As we
have already mentioned, the reaction energy is reduced because
H is a Lewis base and the halogen is a Lewis acid. A more
dramatic reduction of the reaction energy occurs on La-doped
CeO2(111), where the reaction energy is 0.01 eV (Table 5).
This happens because La-doped CeO2(111) is a much stronger
Lewis acid then (ClCe)/CeO2(111). However, the formation
of adsorbed H, which is a Lewis base, will neutralize the Lewis
acidity of the surface through what we called previously a
chemical compensation effect.33 The surface will be reactivated
only if the adsorbed hydrogen is removed by a reaction or by
desorption. If a halogen is used in the gas feed, to activate the
surface, the hydrogen may be removed by desorption as a
halogen hydride. Predicting the evolution of the system after
the breaking of the CH bond is beyond the scope of this
Article. The recombination of the CH3 radicals to form
methane is a possibility. It is also possible to form a methyl
halide, which would be beneficial because this can be converted
to useful products easier than can methane.3,4,8,5052
6. CONCLUSIONS
These calculations show that adsorbed Lewis acids and Lewis
bases interact strongly, and this interaction can be used to
manipulate the chemistry of the surface. A halogen atom can
bind to a Ce atom or an O atom at the surface of Ce(111), and
either process is energetically uphill. However, if a halogen
atom adsorbs on a Ce site and the other on an O site, the
adsorption energy is downhill, because of a strong interaction
between the Lewis acid (ClCe) and the Lewis base (ClO).
If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis
base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis
acid. Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and
this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on
which it is a Lewis base. Doping with Ta has the opposite effect
because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis
base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid.
We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond
in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
