[1] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."

[2] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

[3] "If we preadsorb Br2 to form BrCe on the surface, the energy of the methane dissociation reaction is +0.97 eV (Table 5). As we have already mentioned, the reaction energy is reduced because H is a Lewis base and the halogen is a Lewis acid. A more dramatic reduction of the reaction energy occurs on La-doped CeO2(111), where the reaction energy is 0.01 eV (Table 5)."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts like CeO2 can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It alters the Lewis acid-base properties of the surface. La doping makes CeO2 a stronger Lewis acid, while Ta doping makes it a stronger Lewis base.

2. This changes how adsorbates like halogens bind to the surface. On La-doped CeO2, halogens preferentially bind to O sites as bases. On Ta-doped CeO2, they bind to Ce sites as acids.

3. The binding strength of adsorbates is increased on the doped surfaces compared to undoped CeO2.

4. This can enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions. For example, methane dissociation becomes more favorable on halogenated and La-doped CeO2 surfaces.

5. It affects the nature and location of active sites. La doping creates acidic sites, while Ta doping creates basic sites. 

6. These changes have implications for industrially relevant reactions like methane activation, potentially lowering reaction barriers and improving catalytic performance.

The ability to tune surface properties through doping provides a way to optimize metal oxide catalysts for specific reactions and create more active catalytic centers. This approach shows promise for developing improved catalysts for challenging chemical transformations.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并扰乱化学键合：

1. 它改变了表面的路易斯酸碱性质。La掺杂使CeO2成为更强的路易斯酸，而Ta掺杂使其成为更强的路易斯碱。

2. 这改变了像卤素这样的吸附质与表面的结合方式。在La掺杂的CeO2上，卤素优先作为碱结合到O位点。在Ta掺杂的CeO2上，它们作为酸结合到Ce位点。

3. 与未掺杂的CeO2相比，吸附质在掺杂表面上的结合强度增加。

4. 这可以增强某些反应的催化活性。例如，在卤化和La掺杂的CeO2表面上，甲烷解离变得更加有利。

5. 它影响活性位点的性质和位置。La掺杂创造酸性位点，而Ta掺杂创造碱性位点。

6. 这些变化对工业相关反应（如甲烷活化）有影响，可能降低反应障碍并提高催化性能。

通过掺杂调整表面性质的能力为特定反应优化金属氧化物催化剂并创造更活跃的催化中心提供了一种方法。这种方法在开发用于具有挑战性的化学转化的改进催化剂方面显示出前景。
