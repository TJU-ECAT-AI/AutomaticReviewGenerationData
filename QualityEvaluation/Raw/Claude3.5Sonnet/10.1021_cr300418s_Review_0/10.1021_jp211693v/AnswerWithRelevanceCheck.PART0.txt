          [1] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."

[2] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

[3] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."

[4] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

[5] "To create a ceria surface that is a Lewis acid, we dope it substitutionally with a La atom. This LaCeO2(111) system is created by removing a Ce atom in the top surface layer and replacing it with a La atom. Because the trivalent La atom replaces a tetravalent Ce atom, the doped oxide has a deficit of electrons; therefore, this system is inclined to gain electrons, and it is therefore a Lewis acid."

[6] "Doping Ce with Ta creates an excess of electrons in the oxide (Ta is pentavalent), and we expect TaCeO2(111) to be a strong Lewis base."

[7] "If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid. Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on which it is a Lewis base. Doping with Ta has the opposite effect because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid."

[8] "If we preadsorb Br2 to form BrCe on the surface, the energy of the methane dissociation reaction is +0.97 eV (Table 5). As we have already mentioned, the reaction energy is reduced because H is a Lewis base and the halogen is a Lewis acid. A more dramatic reduction of the reaction energy occurs on La-doped CeO2(111), where the reaction energy is 0.01 eV (Table 5)."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts like CeO2 significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It alters the Lewis acid-base properties of the surface:
   - La3+ doping creates electron deficiency, making the surface a stronger Lewis acid.
   - Ta5+ doping creates electron excess, making the surface a stronger Lewis base.

2. It changes the binding sites and behavior of adsorbates:
   - On La-doped surfaces (Lewis acidic), halogens preferentially bind to oxygen sites as Lewis bases.
   - On Ta-doped surfaces (Lewis basic), halogens bind to metal sites as Lewis acids.

3. It affects the strength of adsorbate binding:
   - The modified Lewis acid-base properties lead to stronger interactions with complementary adsorbates.
   - Halogen binding is considerably stronger on doped surfaces compared to undoped CeO2.

4. It influences reaction energetics:
   - La-doping significantly lowers the energy barrier for methane C-H bond activation.
   - Halogenated surfaces may break C-H bonds in methane more easily than clean oxide surfaces.

5. It creates new active centers:
   - The dopant atoms and their surrounding environment become new catalytically active sites with different properties than the undoped surface.

These modifications have important implications for catalytic activity enhancement:

1. They allow tuning of surface reactivity and selectivity by choosing appropriate dopants.
2. They can lower activation barriers for rate-limiting steps in catalytic reactions.
3. They enable manipulation of adsorbate binding strengths and configurations.
4. They provide a way to stabilize reactive intermediates.

For industrially relevant reactions, such as alkane activation or selective oxidation, strategic doping could potentially improve catalyst performance by:

1. Enhancing C-H bond activation in alkanes.
2. Modifying product selectivity through controlled adsorbate interactions.
3. Improving catalyst stability by tuning adsorbate binding strengths.
4. Creating new reaction pathways through novel surface sites.

However, the effects of doping are complex and can sometimes lead to compensating effects. Therefore, careful design and characterization are necessary to fully leverage the benefits of substitutional doping in heterogeneous catalysts.

          金属氧化物催化剂（如CeO2）中的替代阳离子掺杂通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并扰乱化学键合：

1. 它改变了表面的路易斯酸碱性质：
   - La3+掺杂产生电子缺陷，使表面成为更强的路易斯酸。
   - Ta5+掺杂产生电子过剩，使表面成为更强的路易斯碱。

2. 它改变了吸附物的结合位点和行为：
   - 在La掺杂的表面（路易斯酸性），卤素优先作为路易斯碱结合到氧位点。
   - 在Ta掺杂的表面（路易斯碱性），卤素作为路易斯酸结合到金属位点。

3. 它影响吸附物结合的强度：
   - 修改后的路易斯酸碱性质导致与互补吸附物的相互作用更强。
   - 与未掺杂的CeO2相比，卤素在掺杂表面上的结合强度显著增加。

4. 它影响反应能量学：
   - La掺杂显著降低了甲烷C-H键活化的能量障碍。
   - 卤化表面可能比清洁的氧化物表面更容易断裂甲烷中的C-H键。

5. 它创造了新的活性中心：
   - 掺杂原子及其周围环境成为新的催化活性位点，具有与未掺杂表面不同的性质。

这些修改对催化活性增强有重要影响：

1. 它们允许通过选择适当的掺杂剂来调节表面反应性和选择性。
2. 它们可以降低催化反应中速率限制步骤的活化障碍。
3. 它们能够操纵吸附物结合强度和构型。
4. 它们提供了一种稳定反应性中间体的方法。

对于工业相关反应，如烷烃活化或选择性氧化，战略性掺杂可能通过以下方式改善催化剂性能：

1. 增强烷烃中C-H键的活化。
2. 通过控制吸附物相互作用来修改产品选择性。
3. 通过调节吸附物结合强度来改善催化剂稳定性。
4. 通过新的表面位点创造新的反应途径。

然而，掺杂的效果是复杂的，有时可能导致补偿效应。因此，需要仔细的设计和表征才能充分利用异相催化剂中替代掺杂的优势。
