[1] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."

[2] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

[3] "A further test of the idea that a Lewis acidbase interaction plays an important role in chemisorption on oxides was performed as follows. A H atom tends to donate electrons to an oxide when it adsorbs to make a hydroxyl, and it is therefore a Lewis base."

[4] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It alters the acid-base properties of the surface. La doping makes CeO2 a stronger Lewis acid, while Ta doping makes it a stronger Lewis base.

2. It changes the preferred binding sites and strengths for adsorbates. On La-doped CeO2, halogens bind more strongly to oxygen sites as bases. On Ta-doped CeO2, halogens bind more strongly to cerium sites as acids.

3. It influences the electronic structure and redox properties of the oxide. La doping creates electron deficiency, while Ta doping provides excess electrons.

4. It can create new types of active sites. The doped cations themselves may act as active centers with different properties than the original surface.

5. It affects the interaction between co-adsorbates through acid-base pairing. The modified surface acidity/basicity influences how adsorbates interact with each other.

These modifications have important implications:

- Enhanced catalytic activity for certain reactions by providing stronger binding sites or more favorable acid-base pairing.
- Ability to tune surface properties for specific reactions by choice of dopant.
- New reaction pathways enabled by altered electronic structure or binding preferences.
- Potential improvements for industrially relevant reactions like alkane activation, as the modified surfaces may more easily break C-H bonds.

Overall, cation doping offers a powerful method to engineer oxide catalyst surfaces and optimize their performance for targeted applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键合：

1. 它改变了表面的酸碱性质。La掺杂使CeO2成为更强的Lewis酸，而Ta掺杂使其成为更强的Lewis碱。

2. 它改变了吸附物的优先结合位点和结合强度。在La掺杂的CeO2上，卤素作为碱更强地结合到氧位点。在Ta掺杂的CeO2上，卤素作为酸更强地结合到铈位点。

3. 它影响氧化物的电子结构和氧化还原性质。La掺杂造成电子缺乏，而Ta掺杂提供过量电子。

4. 它可以创造新型的活性位点。掺杂的阳离子本身可能充当具有不同于原始表面性质的活性中心。

5. 它通过酸碱配对影响共吸附物之间的相互作用。改变的表面酸度/碱度影响吸附物之间的相互作用方式。

这些修改具有重要意义：

- 通过提供更强的结合位点或更有利的酸碱配对，增强某些反应的催化活性。
- 能够通过选择掺杂剂来调整表面性质以适应特定反应。
- 通过改变的电子结构或结合偏好，实现新的反应途径。
- 对工业相关反应（如烷烃活化）的潜在改进，因为改性表面可能更容易断裂C-H键。

总的来说，阳离子掺杂提供了一种强大的方法来设计氧化物催化剂表面并优化其性能，以适应特定应用。
