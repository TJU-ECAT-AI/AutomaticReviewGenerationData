[1] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."

[2] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

[3] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."

[4] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts like CeO2 can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It alters the Lewis acid-base properties of the surface. La-doping makes CeO2 more acidic, while Ta-doping makes it more basic.

2. It changes preferred binding sites and strengths for adsorbates. On La-doped CeO2, halogens bind more strongly to O sites as bases. On Ta-doped CeO2, halogens bind more strongly to Ce sites as acids.

3. It allows manipulation of halogen dissociation and adsorption behavior.

4. It can potentially enhance catalytic activity for reactions like C-H bond activation in methane.

The implications include:
- Creation of new types of active sites with tunable acid-base properties
- Ability to control adsorbate binding and reactivity through doping
- Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions like alkane activation
- New strategies for catalyst design by exploiting Lewis acid-base interactions

金属氧化物催化剂（如CeO2）中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并影响化学键合：

1. 它改变了表面的路易斯酸碱性质。La掺杂使CeO2更具酸性，而Ta掺杂使其更具碱性。

2. 它改变了吸附物的优先结合位点和强度。在La掺杂的CeO2上，卤素作为碱更强地结合到O位点。在Ta掺杂的CeO2上，卤素作为酸更强地结合到Ce位点。

3. 它允许操控卤素的解离和吸附行为。

4. 它可能增强甲烷C-H键活化等反应的催化活性。

这些影响包括：
- 创造具有可调酸碱性质的新型活性位点
- 通过掺杂控制吸附物结合和反应性的能力
- 潜在改善工业相关反应，如烷烃活化
- 通过利用路易斯酸碱相互作用开发新的催化剂设计策略
