[1] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."

[2] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

[3] "A further test of the idea that a Lewis acidbase interaction plays an important role in chemisorption on oxides was performed as follows. A H atom tends to donate electrons to an oxide when it adsorbs to make a hydroxyl, and it is therefore a Lewis base."

[4] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It changes the acid-base properties of the surface. La doping makes CeO2 a stronger Lewis acid, while Ta doping makes it a stronger Lewis base.

2. It alters the preferred binding sites and bonding strength of adsorbates. On La-doped CeO2, halogens bind more strongly to oxygen sites as bases. On Ta-doped CeO2, halogens bind more strongly to Ce sites as acids.

3. It affects the nature and location of active centers. The doped cations create new types of sites with different electronic properties compared to the undoped surface.

4. It can enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions. For example, halogenated surfaces may be more effective at breaking C-H bonds in methane compared to clean oxide surfaces.

5. It allows for tuning of surface properties to optimize catalytic performance for specific reactions of industrial relevance, like alkane activation.

The implications are that careful selection of dopants can be used to engineer oxide catalyst surfaces with desired acid-base characteristics, binding preferences, and reactivity to improve their performance for targeted industrial processes. The ability to manipulate surface chemistry through doping provides a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimization.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学和化学键合：

1. 它改变了表面的酸碱性质。La掺杂使CeO2成为更强的Lewis酸，而Ta掺杂使其成为更强的Lewis碱。

2. 它改变了吸附物的首选结合位点和结合强度。在La掺杂的CeO2上，卤素作为碱更强地结合到氧位点。在Ta掺杂的CeO2上，卤素作为酸更强地结合到Ce位点。

3. 它影响活性中心的性质和位置。掺杂的阳离子创造了具有不同电子性质的新型位点，与未掺杂的表面相比。

4. 它可以增强某些反应的催化活性。例如，卤化表面可能比清洁的氧化物表面更有效地断裂甲烷中的C-H键。

5. 它允许调整表面性质，以优化特定工业相关反应的催化性能，如烷烃活化。

这些影响意味着可以通过仔细选择掺杂剂来设计具有所需酸碱特性、结合偏好和反应性的氧化物催化剂表面，以提高其在目标工业过程中的性能。通过掺杂来操纵表面化学性质的能力为催化剂设计和优化提供了强大的工具。
