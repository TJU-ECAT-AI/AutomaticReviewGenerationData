          [1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

          [2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

          [3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

          [4] "Thus, LiC1-Sm203 may be a useful catalyst in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4."

          The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it provides insights into the effects of adding lithium salts to Sm2O3 catalysts:

          1. Adding LiOH, LiNO3, and Li2CO3 to Sm2O3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivity, resulting in higher C2-yields (19.5-22.2% compared to Sm2O3 alone).

          2. LiCl addition specifically enhanced C2H4 (ethylene) selectivity without increasing methane conversion.

          3. The favorable effect of LiCl addition is attributed to suppressing further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2.

          These observations suggest that cation doping can modify catalytic activity and selectivity, potentially by altering the nature and location of active centers. The specific enhancement of C2H4 selectivity with LiCl addition implies a change in the catalyst's ability to activate certain chemical bonds. While the exact mechanisms are not detailed, these results demonstrate that doping metal oxide catalysts with alkali metal salts can lead to significant improvements in industrially relevant reactions, such as the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4.

          However, the literature does not provide comprehensive explanations of how the doping process modifies surface chemistry at the atomic level or disrupts chemical bonding. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question's specifics regarding surface chemistry modifications, chemical bonding disruption, and the nature and location of active centers in these doped catalysts.

          该文献并未直接阐述取代型阳离子掺杂如何修改金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质并破坏化学键合。然而，它提供了一些关于向氧化钐（Sm2O3）催化剂中添加锂盐的影响的见解：

          1. 向Sm2O3添加LiOH、LiNO3和Li2CO3既增加了甲烷转化率，又提高了C2选择性，从而导致更高的C2产率（与单独使用Sm2O3相比，产率为19.5-22.2%）。

          2. 添加LiCl特别增强了C2H4（乙烯）的选择性，但没有增加甲烷转化率。

          3. 添加LiCl的有利效果归因于抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2的过程。

          这些观察结果表明，阳离子掺杂可以改变催化活性和选择性，可能是通过改变活性中心的性质和位置。LiCl添加特别增强C2H4选择性的现象暗示了催化剂活化某些化学键的能力发生了变化。虽然没有详细说明确切的机制，但这些结果表明，用碱金属盐掺杂金属氧化物催化剂可以显著改善工业相关反应，如从CH4选择性合成C2H4。

          然而，文献并未全面解释掺杂过程如何在原子层面上修改表面化学性质或破坏化学键合。需要进行更详细的研究才能完全解答问题中关于表面化学修饰、化学键合破坏以及这些掺杂催化剂中活性中心性质和位置的具体问题。
