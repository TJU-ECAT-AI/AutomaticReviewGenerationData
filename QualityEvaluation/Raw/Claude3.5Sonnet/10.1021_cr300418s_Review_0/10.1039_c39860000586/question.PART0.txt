Methane is partially oxidised over LiCI-Sm203 catalyst to give C2-compounds 
(ethylene and ethane) in 7.2-1 9.9% 
C2-yield at 750 "C, 
with a high C2H4:C2H6 
ratio. 
Although the catalytic partial oxidation of methane is of 
potential technological importance, there have been only a 
few fundamental reports on this reaction.I4 We have already 
reported that samarium oxide is an active and selective 
catalyst in the oxidative coupling of methane.4 An Sm203 
catalyst containing added alkali metal carbonate showed 
better catalytic activity and selectivity giving a C2-yield of 
21% 
.5 It is believed that oxidative coupling of methane is 
initiated by the abstraction of H from CH4 to form CH3 
radicals,3 and that C2H6 
is produced by a coupling between

two CH3 
radicals. The subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation 
of C2H6 produces C2H4.2J.5 Usually the C2-compounds 
produced from methane oxidation consist of C2H6 in prefer- 
ence to C2H4 as C2H6 is oxidized preferentially to CO and 
C02, and a low selectivity of C2H4 
is observed under the 
reaction conditions in which methane can be activated. Thus 
the subsequent conversion of C2H6 into C2H4 is usually 
necessary. Therefore, catalysts which convert CH4 directly 
into C2H4 with high selectivity are desirable. We report here 
the selective synthesis of ethylene from methane over LiC1- 
Sm203 
catalyst. 
Powder catalysts of alkali metal salts-Sm203, containing 20 
molyo alkali metal, were prepared from lithium salts and 
Sm2O3. The experiments were carried out using a conven- 
tional gas-flow system at atmospheric pressure. 
Table 1 
shows the effects of adding different lithium salts to 
Sm203 
on the conversion of methane, the selectivities of C2H4 
and C2H6, 
and the C2-yield 
(C2H4+C2H6). 
The selectivities of 
C2H4 and C2H6 were defined as the yields of C2H4 and C2H6, 
respectively, as a percentage of the CH4 conversion. The 
Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 
increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, result- 
ing in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) 
compared with Sm203 alone. The addition of LiCl did not 
increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically 
the selectivity of C2H4. 
Table 2 shows the effect of total pressure of CH4 
and 0 2  
on 
the reaction. The ratio of C2H4:C2H6 was 7.7-3.3 
for 
pressures of 0.07-0.98 
atm. The yield of C2H4 at a pressure of 
reactants less than 0.30 atm was 12.4-13.0/. The yield of 
C2H4 
for LiC1-Sm203 shown in Table 1 was 16.8%. These 
yields are considerably better than results reported in the 
literature for other metal oxide catalysts. 1-3 
Thus, LiC1-Sm203 may be a useful catalyst in the selective 
synthesis of C2H4 from CH4. 
The favourable effect observed 
on addition of LiCl to Sm203 
is due to depression of the 
further oxidation of CH4 
and C2H6 to CO and C02.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
