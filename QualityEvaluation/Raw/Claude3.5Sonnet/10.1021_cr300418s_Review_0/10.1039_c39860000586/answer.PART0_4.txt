[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

[2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

[3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into the effects of adding lithium salts to Sm2O3 catalysts:

Adding certain lithium salts (LiOH, LiNO3, Li2CO3) to Sm2O3 increased both methane conversion and C2 selectivity. Adding LiCl specifically enhanced C2H4 selectivity without increasing methane conversion. The favorable effect of LiCl addition was attributed to suppressing further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2.

These observations suggest that cation doping can modify catalyst selectivity and activity, likely by altering surface chemistry and active sites. However, the exact mechanisms of how the doping disrupts chemical bonding or modifies active centers are not explained in detail. The study demonstrates potential for improving industrially relevant reactions like partial methane oxidation through careful selection of dopants, but does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying principles.

该文献并未直接阐述取代型阳离子掺杂如何改变金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质和破坏化学键。但是，它确实提供了一些关于向Sm2O3催化剂中添加锂盐的影响的见解：

添加某些锂盐（LiOH、LiNO3、Li2CO3）到Sm2O3中可以同时增加甲烷转化率和C2选择性。添加LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但不增加甲烷转化率。LiCl添加的有利效果归因于抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化成CO和CO2。

这些观察结果表明，阳离子掺杂可以改变催化剂的选择性和活性，很可能是通过改变表面化学性质和活性位点。然而，掺杂如何破坏化学键或修改活性中心的确切机制并未详细解释。这项研究表明，通过谨慎选择掺杂剂，可以改进工业相关反应（如部分甲烷氧化），但并未对其背后的原理提供全面解释。
