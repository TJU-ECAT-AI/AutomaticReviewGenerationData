[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

[2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

[3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into the effects of adding lithium salts to Sm2O3 catalysts:

1. Adding LiOH, LiNO3, and Li2CO3 to Sm2O3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivity, resulting in higher C2-yields.

2. LiCl addition specifically enhanced C2H4 selectivity without increasing methane conversion.

3. The favorable effect of LiCl addition is attributed to suppressing further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2.

These observations suggest that cation doping can modify catalytic activity and selectivity, potentially by altering the nature and location of active centers. However, the exact mechanisms of how doping affects surface chemistry and chemical bonding are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question's specifics regarding surface chemistry modifications, chemical bonding disruption, and implications for industrially relevant reactions.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论取代型阳离子掺杂如何改变金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质和破坏化学键。但是，它确实提供了一些关于向Sm2O3催化剂中添加锂盐的影响的见解：

1. 向Sm2O3中添加LiOH、LiNO3和Li2CO3既增加了甲烷转化率，又提高了C2选择性，从而导致更高的C2产率。

2. 添加LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但没有增加甲烷的转化率。

3. 添加LiCl的有利效果归因于抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2。

这些观察结果表明，阳离子掺杂可以改变催化活性和选择性，可能是通过改变活性中心的性质和位置。然而，掺杂如何影响表面化学性质和化学键的确切机制在给定的文献中并未明确讨论。需要更详细的研究来全面回答问题中关于表面化学性质修饰、化学键破坏以及对工业相关反应的影响的具体细节。
