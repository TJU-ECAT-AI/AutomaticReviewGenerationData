[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

[2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

[3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the effects of adding various lithium salts to Sm2O3 catalysts, which could be considered a form of surface modification. The addition of LiOH, LiNO3, and Li2CO3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivities. LiCl specifically enhanced C2H4 selectivity without increasing methane conversion. The favorable effect of LiCl addition was attributed to suppressing further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2. These modifications altered the catalytic activity and selectivity, suggesting changes in the nature and location of active centers. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how these additions disrupt chemical bonding or modify surface chemistry at the atomic level.

这篇文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂。然而，它确实讨论了向Sm2O3催化剂中添加各种锂盐的影响，这可以被视为一种表面改性。添加LiOH、LiNO3和Li2CO3既增加了甲烷转化率，又提高了C2选择性。LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但并未增加甲烷转化率。LiCl添加的有利效果被归因于抑制CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2。这些改性改变了催化活性和选择性，暗示了活性中心的性质和位置发生了变化。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些添加如何在原子层面上破坏化学键或改变表面化学的详细信息。

The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into how adding lithium salts to Sm2O3 affects catalytic activity:

1. Adding LiOH, LiNO3, and Li2CO3 to Sm2O3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivity, resulting in higher C2-yields.

2. Adding LiCl to Sm2O3 specifically enhanced C2H4 selectivity without increasing methane conversion.

3. The addition of LiCl to Sm2O3 depressed further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2, which is likely responsible for the improved C2H4 selectivity.

These effects suggest that lithium doping can modify the catalytic properties of Sm2O3, potentially by altering surface chemistry or active sites. However, the exact mechanisms of how this doping affects chemical bonding or the nature and location of active centers are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question's specifics about surface chemistry modifications, chemical bonding disruption, and the nature of active centers in these doped catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论取代性阳离子掺杂如何修改金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质和破坏化学键合。然而，它确实提供了一些关于向Sm2O3添加锂盐如何影响催化活性的见解：

1. 向Sm2O3添加LiOH、LiNO3和Li2CO3增加了甲烷转化率和C2选择性，从而提高了C2产率。

2. 向Sm2O3添加LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但没有增加甲烷转化率。

3. 向Sm2O3添加LiCl抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2的过程，这可能是C2H4选择性提高的原因。

这些效果表明锂掺杂可以修改Sm2O3的催化性能，可能是通过改变表面化学性质或活性位点。然而，关于这种掺杂如何影响化学键合或活性中心的性质和位置的确切机制在给定的文献中并未明确讨论。需要进行更详细的研究才能完全解答问题中关于表面化学修饰、化学键合破坏以及这些掺杂催化剂中活性中心性质的具体问题。

The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into the effects of adding lithium salts to samarium oxide (Sm2O3) catalysts:

1. The addition of certain lithium salts (LiOH, LiNO3, Li2CO3) to Sm2O3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivities, resulting in higher C2-yields.

2. LiCl addition to Sm2O3 did not increase methane conversion but specifically enhanced C2H4 (ethylene) selectivity.

3. The favorable effect of LiCl addition to Sm2O3 was attributed to the suppression of further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2.

These observations suggest that the addition of lithium salts to Sm2O3 catalysts modifies their catalytic properties, potentially by altering the surface chemistry or active sites. The specific enhancement of C2H4 selectivity with LiCl addition implies a change in the nature or location of active centers. The suppression of further oxidation indicates a modification of the catalyst's ability to activate certain chemical bonds.

While the exact mechanisms are not detailed in the literature, these results demonstrate that doping metal oxide catalysts with alkali metal salts can lead to significant improvements in industrially relevant reactions, such as the partial oxidation of methane to produce ethylene.

该文献并未直接阐述取代型阳离子掺杂如何修改金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质并破坏化学键合。然而，它确实提供了一些关于向氧化钐（Sm2O3）催化剂中添加锂盐的影响的见解：

1. 添加某些锂盐（LiOH、LiNO3、Li2CO3）到Sm2O3中既增加了甲烷转化率，又提高了C2选择性，从而导致更高的C2产率。

2. 向Sm2O3中添加LiCl并未增加甲烷转化率，但特别增强了C2H4（乙烯）的选择性。

3. 向Sm2O3中添加LiCl的有利效果被归因于抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2的过程。

这些观察结果表明，向Sm2O3催化剂中添加锂盐改变了其催化性能，可能是通过改变表面化学性质或活性位点。LiCl添加特别增强C2H4选择性的现象暗示了活性中心的性质或位置发生了变化。对进一步氧化的抑制表明催化剂活化某些化学键的能力发生了改变。

虽然文献中没有详细说明确切的机制，但这些结果表明，用碱金属盐掺杂金属氧化物催化剂可以显著改善工业相关反应，如甲烷部分氧化生产乙烯的过程。

添加某些锂盐（LiOH、LiNO3、Li2CO3）到Sm2O3中可以同时增加甲烷转化率和C2选择性。添加LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但不增加甲烷转化率。LiCl添加的有利效果归因于抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化成CO和CO2。
