[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

[2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

[3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into how adding lithium salts to Sm2O3 affects catalytic activity:

1. Adding LiOH, LiNO3, and Li2CO3 to Sm2O3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivity, resulting in higher C2-yields.

2. Adding LiCl to Sm2O3 specifically enhanced C2H4 selectivity without increasing methane conversion.

3. The addition of LiCl to Sm2O3 depressed further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2, which is likely responsible for the improved C2H4 selectivity.

These effects suggest that lithium doping can modify the catalytic properties of Sm2O3, potentially by altering surface chemistry or active sites. However, the exact mechanisms of how this doping affects chemical bonding or the nature and location of active centers are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question's specifics about surface chemistry modifications, chemical bonding disruption, and the nature of active centers in these doped catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论取代性阳离子掺杂如何修改金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质和破坏化学键合。然而，它确实提供了一些关于向Sm2O3添加锂盐如何影响催化活性的见解：

1. 向Sm2O3添加LiOH、LiNO3和Li2CO3增加了甲烷转化率和C2选择性，从而提高了C2产率。

2. 向Sm2O3添加LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但没有增加甲烷转化率。

3. 向Sm2O3添加LiCl抑制了CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2的过程，这可能是C2H4选择性提高的原因。

这些效果表明锂掺杂可以修改Sm2O3的催化性能，可能是通过改变表面化学性质或活性位点。然而，关于这种掺杂如何影响化学键合或活性中心的性质和位置的确切机制在给定的文献中并未明确讨论。需要进行更详细的研究才能完全解答问题中关于表面化学修饰、化学键合破坏以及这些掺杂催化剂中活性中心性质的具体问题。
