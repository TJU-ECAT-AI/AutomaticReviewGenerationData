[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

[2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

[3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the effects of adding various lithium salts to Sm2O3 catalysts, which could be considered a form of surface modification. The addition of LiOH, LiNO3, and Li2CO3 increased both methane conversion and C2-selectivities. LiCl specifically enhanced C2H4 selectivity without increasing methane conversion. The favorable effect of LiCl addition was attributed to suppressing further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and CO2. These modifications altered the catalytic activity and selectivity, suggesting changes in the nature and location of active centers. However, the document does not provide detailed information on how these additions disrupt chemical bonding or modify surface chemistry at the atomic level.

这篇文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂。然而，它确实讨论了向Sm2O3催化剂中添加各种锂盐的影响，这可以被视为一种表面改性。添加LiOH、LiNO3和Li2CO3既增加了甲烷转化率，又提高了C2选择性。LiCl特别增强了C2H4的选择性，但并未增加甲烷转化率。LiCl添加的有利效果被归因于抑制CH4和C2H6进一步氧化为CO和CO2。这些改性改变了催化活性和选择性，暗示了活性中心的性质和位置发生了变化。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些添加如何在原子层面上破坏化学键或改变表面化学的详细信息。
