[1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[3] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it examines the effects of chlorine incorporation into cerium oxide (CeO2) catalysts, which provides some insights relevant to the question:

1. Surface modification: Chlorine introduction forms CeOCl on the CeO2 surface, modifying its chemistry.

2. Chemical bonding disruption: Chloride ions may perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as diluents.

3. Catalytic activity enhancement: The chlorinated surface enhances ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE).

4. Active centers: The study implies surface-dependent conversion and selectivity, suggesting the importance of surface-based active centers.

5. Industrial relevance: The findings show potential for improving ethylene production through catalyst surface modification.

While this example involves anion (chloride) incorporation rather than substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how modifying the surface chemistry of metal oxide catalysts can significantly impact their catalytic properties and performance in industrially relevant reactions.

这项研究并未直接涉及金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。然而，它考察了氯引入氧化铈(CeO2)催化剂的影响，这为该问题提供了一些相关见解：

1. 表面修饰：氯的引入在CeO2表面形成CeOCl，改变了其化学性质。

2. 化学键断裂：氯离子可能会扰乱表面氧离子的电子密度或作为稀释剂。

3. 催化活性增强：氯化表面增强了乙烷氧化脱氢(ODE)反应中的乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。

4. 活性中心：研究暗示转化率和选择性依赖于表面，表明表面活性中心的重要性。

5. 工业相关性：研究结果显示通过催化剂表面修饰可能改进乙烯生产。

虽然这个例子涉及的是阴离子（氯离子）的引入而非替代阳离子掺杂，但它展示了如何通过修改金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质可以显著影响其催化特性和在工业相关反应中的性能。
