[1] "XP spectra show the presence of Cl 2p on CeO2 after use in oxidation as well as the expected O 1s and Ce3d5/2, the binding energies of which remain invariant with changes in P(O2), the introduction of TCM or argon-ion etching"

[2] "Since the Cl/Ce ratios are reduced by factors as large as 3 after argon-ion etching for 1 min the chlorine is apparently predominantly held within the outer portion of the surface region."

[3] "In view of the relatively small values found for Cl/Ce it is tempting to suggest that at least the localized form of the chlorided surface more closely resembles CeOCl rather than CeCl3."

[4] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[5] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species."

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping, but rather examines the effects of chlorine addition to cerium oxide catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Chlorine incorporation modifies the surface chemistry of CeO2, likely forming CeOCl species predominantly in the outer surface region. This changes the electronic and chemical properties of the catalyst surface.

2. The chlorinated surface enhances catalytic activity for ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene. This suggests the chlorine disrupts the original CeO2 bonding to create new active sites.

3. The effect appears to be indirect rather than direct participation of chloride ions. Possible mechanisms include perturbing electron density of surface oxygen or diluting oxygen species.

4. The chlorinated surface suppresses further oxidation of products, improving selectivity. This indicates the modified surface chemistry alters reaction pathways.

5. The effects are surface-dependent, implying the nature and location of active centers are changed by chlorine incorporation.

While not substitutional doping, this surface modification by chlorine demonstrates how altering surface chemistry through additives can enhance catalytic performance for industrially relevant reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation. Further study of the electronic and structural changes could provide insights applicable to cation doping strategies.

这项研究并未直接涉及替代性阳离子掺杂,而是研究了在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中向二氧化铈催化剂中添加氯的影响。然而,我们可以得出一些见解:

1. 氯的引入改变了CeO2的表面化学性质,很可能在外表面区域形成CeOCl物种。这改变了催化剂表面的电子和化学性质。

2. 氯化表面提高了乙烷转化的催化活性和乙烯的选择性。这表明氯破坏了原有的CeO2键合,创造了新的活性位点。

3. 这种效应似乎是间接的,而不是氯离子的直接参与。可能的机制包括扰动表面氧的电子密度或稀释氧物种。

4. 氯化表面抑制了产物的进一步氧化,提高了选择性。这表明改变的表面化学性质改变了反应途径。

5. 这些效应依赖于表面,意味着活性中心的性质和位置因氯的引入而改变。

虽然这不是替代性掺杂,但这种通过氯引入的表面改性表明,通过添加剂改变表面化学性质可以提高氧化脱氢等工业相关反应的催化性能。对电子和结构变化的进一步研究可能为阳离子掺杂策略提供适用的见解。
