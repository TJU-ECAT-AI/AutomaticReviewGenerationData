[1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[3] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species."

[4] "In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does examine the effects of introducing chlorine onto the surface of CeO2 catalysts, which provides some insights relevant to the question:

1. Surface modification: Introducing chlorine modifies the surface chemistry of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCl on the surface.

2. Chemical bonding disruption: The chloride ions may perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as a diluent.

3. Catalytic activity enhancement: The chlorided surface enhances both ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE).

4. Nature and location of active centers: The study implies that the active centers are surface-dependent, with the chlorided surface playing a crucial role.

5. Implications for industrial reactions: The enhanced conversion and selectivity in ODE suggest potential improvements for this industrially relevant reaction.

While this study focuses on surface modification rather than substitutional doping, it demonstrates how introducing new elements to a catalyst surface can significantly alter its catalytic properties. This principle may extend to other forms of catalyst modification, including substitutional cation doping.

这项研究并未直接涉及金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂。然而，它确实研究了在CeO2催化剂表面引入氯的效果，这为该问题提供了一些相关见解：

1. 表面改性：引入氯修改了CeO2的表面化学性质，显然在表面形成了CeOCl。

2. 化学键断裂：氯离子可能扰乱表面氧离子的电子密度或作为稀释剂。

3. 催化活性增强：氯化表面在乙烷氧化脱氢（ODE）反应中同时增强了乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性。

4. 活性中心的性质和位置：研究暗示活性中心是表面依赖的，氯化表面起着关键作用。

5. 对工业反应的影响：ODE反应中转化率和选择性的提高表明这对该工业相关反应有潜在改进。

虽然这项研究主要关注表面改性而非取代掺杂，但它展示了向催化剂表面引入新元素如何能显著改变其催化性能。这一原理可能延伸到其他形式的催化剂改性，包括取代阳离子掺杂。
