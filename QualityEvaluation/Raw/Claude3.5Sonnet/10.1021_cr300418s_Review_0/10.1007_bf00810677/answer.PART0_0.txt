[1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "Values for C1 / Ce of the catalysts previously employed in obtaining the results shown in fig. 5 show little or no dependence on the reaction temperature, but some dependence on P(TCM), not surprisingly, is evident (table 3)."

[3] "Since no correlation between these results and those obtained from the catalytic studies is evident, it may be concluded that even at the lowest P(TCM) employed in the present work sufficient of the chlorinated species, presumably CeOC1, is present to alter the course of the reaction."

[4] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

The study does not directly examine substitutional cation doping, but rather focuses on the effects of chlorine addition to cerium oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Surface modification: Chlorine introduction creates CeOCl species on the CeO2 surface, altering its chemistry.

2. Chemical bonding disruption: The chloride ions likely perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as diluents.

3. Catalytic activity enhancement: The chlorinated surface enhances ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene.

4. Active centers: The study implies that the chlorinated surface regions serve as active sites for the reaction.

5. Potential improvements: The chlorinated CeO2 surface shows improved performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, which is an industrially relevant reaction.

While not strictly substitutional doping, this chlorine modification demonstrates how altering surface chemistry can significantly impact catalyst performance. The study suggests that carefully controlled surface modifications could be a promising approach for enhancing catalytic activity in metal oxide systems.

这项研究并未直接研究替代性阳离子掺杂，而是关注在氧化铈催化剂中添加氯的效果。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

1. 表面修饰：氯的引入在CeO2表面创造了CeOCl物种，改变了其化学性质。

2. 化学键断裂：氯离子可能扰乱了表面氧离子的电子密度，或作为稀释剂。

3. 催化活性增强：氯化表面增强了乙烷的转化率和乙烯的选择性。

4. 活性中心：研究暗示氯化表面区域作为反应的活性位点。

5. 潜在改进：氯化CeO2表面在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出改善的性能，这是一个工业相关的反应。

虽然这不是严格意义上的替代性掺杂，但这种氯修饰展示了改变表面化学性质如何能显著影响催化剂性能。研究表明，精心控制的表面修饰可能是一种有前景的方法，可以增强金属氧化物系统中的催化活性。
