[1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[3] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it provides insights into how surface modification through chlorine addition affects catalytic activity in cerium oxide:

1. Chlorine introduction forms CeOCl on the CeO2 surface, enhancing catalytic activity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. The chloride ions may perturb surface oxygen electron density or act as diluents, leading to improved ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity.

3. The chlorided surface suppresses further oxidation of ethylene, improving selectivity.

4. These effects imply both conversion and selectivity are surface-dependent.

5. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but the chlorine modification clearly alters the nature and behavior of active sites on the catalyst surface.

While not substitutional doping, this surface modification demonstrates how altering surface chemistry can significantly impact catalytic performance in industrially relevant reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

这项研究并未直接涉及金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。然而，它提供了关于通过氯添加进行表面改性如何影响氧化铈催化活性的见解：

1. 氯的引入在CeO2表面形成CeOCl，增强了乙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性。

2. 氯离子可能扰乱表面氧的电子密度或作为稀释剂，导致乙烷转化率和乙烯选择性的提高。

3. 氯化表面抑制了乙烯的进一步氧化，提高了选择性。

4. 这些效果表明转化率和选择性都依赖于表面特性。

5. 确切的机理尚未完全了解，但氯改性显然改变了催化剂表面活性位点的性质和行为。

虽然这不是替代掺杂，但这种表面改性表明，改变表面化学性质可以显著影响工业相关反应（如乙烷氧化脱氢）的催化性能。
