[1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "Values for C1 / Ce of the catalysts previously employed in obtaining the results shown in fig. 5 show little or no dependence on the reaction temperature, but some dependence on P(TCM), not surprisingly, is evident (table 3)."

[3] "Since no correlation between these results and those obtained from the catalytic studies is evident, it may be concluded that even at the lowest P(TCM) employed in the present work sufficient of the chlorinated species, presumably CeOC1, is present to alter the course of the reaction."

[4] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

The study does not directly examine substitutional cation doping, but rather focuses on the effects of chlorine addition to cerium oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Surface modification: Chlorine introduction creates CeOCl species on the CeO2 surface, altering its chemistry.

2. Chemical bonding disruption: The chloride ions likely perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as diluents.

3. Catalytic activity enhancement: The chlorinated surface enhances ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene.

4. Active centers: The study implies that the chlorinated surface regions serve as active sites for the reaction.

5. Potential improvements: The chlorinated CeO2 surface shows improved performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, which is an industrially relevant reaction.

While not strictly substitutional doping, this chlorine modification demonstrates how altering surface chemistry can significantly impact catalyst performance. The study suggests that carefully controlled surface modifications could be a promising approach for enhancing catalytic activity in metal oxide systems.

这项研究并未直接研究替代性阳离子掺杂，而是关注在氧化铈催化剂中添加氯的效果。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

1. 表面修饰：氯的引入在CeO2表面创造了CeOCl物种，改变了其化学性质。

2. 化学键断裂：氯离子可能扰乱了表面氧离子的电子密度，或作为稀释剂。

3. 催化活性增强：氯化表面增强了乙烷的转化率和乙烯的选择性。

4. 活性中心：研究暗示氯化表面区域作为反应的活性位点。

5. 潜在改进：氯化CeO2表面在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出改善的性能，这是一个工业相关的反应。

虽然这不是严格意义上的替代性掺杂，但这种氯修饰展示了改变表面化学性质如何能显著影响催化剂性能。研究表明，精心控制的表面修饰可能是一种有前景的方法，可以增强金属氧化物系统中的催化活性。

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does examine the effects of introducing chlorine onto the surface of CeO2 catalysts, which provides some insights relevant to the question:

1. Surface modification: Introducing chlorine modifies the surface chemistry of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCl on the surface.

2. Chemical bonding disruption: The chloride ions may perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as a diluent.

3. Catalytic activity enhancement: The chlorided surface enhances both ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE).

4. Nature and location of active centers: The study implies that the active centers are surface-dependent, with the chlorided surface playing a crucial role.

5. Implications for industrial reactions: The enhanced conversion and selectivity in ODE suggest potential improvements for this industrially relevant reaction.

While this study focuses on surface modification rather than substitutional doping, it demonstrates how introducing new elements to a catalyst surface can significantly alter its catalytic properties. This principle may extend to other forms of catalyst modification, including substitutional cation doping.

[1] "XP spectra show the presence of Cl 2p on CeO2 after use in oxidation as well as the expected O 1s and Ce3d5/2, the binding energies of which remain invariant with changes in P(O2), the introduction of TCM or argon-ion etching"

[2] "Since the Cl/Ce ratios are reduced by factors as large as 3 after argon-ion etching for 1 min the chlorine is apparently predominantly held within the outer portion of the surface region."

[3] "In view of the relatively small values found for Cl/Ce it is tempting to suggest that at least the localized form of the chlorided surface more closely resembles CeOCl rather than CeCl3."

[4] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[5] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species."

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping, but rather examines the effects of chlorine addition to cerium oxide catalysts for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Chlorine incorporation modifies the surface chemistry of CeO2, likely forming CeOCl species predominantly in the outer surface region. This changes the electronic and chemical properties of the catalyst surface.

2. The chlorinated surface enhances catalytic activity for ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene. This suggests the chlorine disrupts the original CeO2 bonding to create new active sites.

3. The effect appears to be indirect rather than direct participation of chloride ions. Possible mechanisms include perturbing electron density of surface oxygen or diluting oxygen species.

4. The chlorinated surface suppresses further oxidation of products, improving selectivity. This indicates the modified surface chemistry alters reaction pathways.

5. The effects are surface-dependent, implying the nature and location of active centers are changed by chlorine incorporation.

While not substitutional doping, this surface modification by chlorine demonstrates how altering surface chemistry through additives can enhance catalytic performance for industrially relevant reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation. Further study of the electronic and structural changes could provide insights applicable to cation doping strategies.

这项研究并未直接涉及替代性阳离子掺杂,而是研究了在乙烷氧化脱氢反应中向二氧化铈催化剂中添加氯的影响。然而,我们可以得出一些见解:

1. 氯的引入改变了CeO2的表面化学性质,很可能在外表面区域形成CeOCl物种。这改变了催化剂表面的电子和化学性质。

2. 氯化表面提高了乙烷转化的催化活性和乙烯的选择性。这表明氯破坏了原有的CeO2键合,创造了新的活性位点。

3. 这种效应似乎是间接的,而不是氯离子的直接参与。可能的机制包括扰动表面氧的电子密度或稀释氧物种。

4. 氯化表面抑制了产物的进一步氧化,提高了选择性。这表明改变的表面化学性质改变了反应途径。

5. 这些效应依赖于表面,意味着活性中心的性质和位置因氯的引入而改变。

虽然这不是替代性掺杂,但这种通过氯引入的表面改性表明,通过添加剂改变表面化学性质可以提高氧化脱氢等工业相关反应的催化性能。对电子和结构变化的进一步研究可能为阳离子掺杂策略提供适用的见解。

The study does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it examines the effects of chlorine incorporation into cerium oxide (CeO2) catalysts, which provides some insights relevant to the question:

1. Surface modification: Chlorine introduction forms CeOCl on the CeO2 surface, modifying its chemistry.

2. Chemical bonding disruption: Chloride ions may perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as diluents.

3. Catalytic activity enhancement: The chlorinated surface enhances ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE).

4. Active centers: The study implies surface-dependent conversion and selectivity, suggesting the importance of surface-based active centers.

5. Industrial relevance: The findings show potential for improving ethylene production through catalyst surface modification.

While this example involves anion (chloride) incorporation rather than substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how modifying the surface chemistry of metal oxide catalysts can significantly impact their catalytic properties and performance in industrially relevant reactions.
