Abstract
The paper presents results of systematic studies in the effects of a wide range of amounts of chloride ions introduced to the Na/CaO catalyst on
the oxidative coupling of methane carried out in varied reaction conditions concerning a wide range of temperatures, oxygen concentrations and
contact times of reagents with the catalyst. The positive inﬂuence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the
catalyst and speciﬁc effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature. There is an optimal content (about 2 wt.%) of chloride ions in Na/CaO, at
which the total selectivity of reaction and selectivity of ethane formation reach the highest values, higher than those with the chloride-free catalyst.
An improvement in the selectivity of ethylene formation is obtained only at higher reaction temperatures. Still, at every amount of chloride ions
present in the catalyst, there may occur a decrease in its activity, especially at lower reaction temperatures. The operation of the chloride modiﬁer
consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most
active of these sites from methane transformations.

1. Introduction
The high and unstable prices of oil stimulate a re-examination
of the process of oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and its
catalysts. Finding a selective catalyst, which would enable a
replacement of oil with the natural gas to obtain ethylene still
constitutes a great challenge.
In studies carried out so far, many kinds of potential catalysts
of the OCM process have been applied, mainly alkaline-earth
oxides, lanthanide oxides, transition metal oxides, etc., which
were most frequently promoted with alkali metal ions [1–6].
In order to increase the selectivity of forming C2+ hydrocar-
bons (containing two and more carbon atoms in the molecule,
mainly ethane and ethylene), additional promoters and modi-
ﬁers were added to the catalysts. Chloride ions have proved to be
promising modiﬁers of many kinds of OCM process catalysts,
not only oxide-based. They were introduced into the catalyst
already on the stage of its preparation, often together with an

alkali metal promoter, e.g. LiCl or NaCl [7–12] or by employ-
ing materials containing chloride ions: oxychlorides [16,22],
chlorinated precursors of perovskites [23] or chlorophosphates
and chloroapatites [24], but also in the form of ammonium
chloride or hydrochloric acid, as an additional modiﬁer of
catalysts obtained from chloride-free precursors [25,26,27]. Cat-
alyst modiﬁcation was also accomplished by adding chlorine
[28], hydrogen chloride [25,28,29–31] or chlorine-containing
gaseouscompounds–alkanechlorides(mainlychloromethanes)
[9,15,17,19,23,29,32–46] – to the stream of the main reagents.
Although the inﬂuence of these compounds on the course of the
gas-phase steps of the OCM could not be excluded with cer-
tainty, nevertheless it has been demonstrated that they undergo
destructive adsorption [47], leaving chloride ions on catalysts,
which changes the properties of the catalyst surface and has
important effects on the OCM [19,25,29,39–44].
The literature data on the effects of applying a chloride mod-
iﬁer are however ambiguous and even contradictory.
According to some reports, the presence of chloride ions
in the catalyst caused an increase in methane conversion
[8,12,14,24–27], yield [12,14,27] and total selectivity of C2+
hydrocarbons formation [9,12,14,21,23,24,26,27]. A signiﬁcant

and promising effect of the OCM on catalysts containing chlo-
ride ions was an increase in the selectivity of ethylene formation
[8,10,17,21,23,24,26], especially, the mutual relation of the
ethylene and ethane concentrations in the products of the pro-
cess [8,10,11,17,22,24–26]. The latter effect was attributed to
the intensiﬁcation of one of the important secondary stages
of the OCM process, namely, the dehydrogenation of ethane.
The effect of chloride ions on the stage of the dehydrogenation
of ethane was very evident and was conﬁrmed by indepen-
dent studies in the process of oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane [10,20,25,48,49]. Such effects of the OCM process,
on the whole, clearly positive were observed after the modi-
ﬁcation with chloride ions on catalysts Li/MgO [10,11,25,27],
Bi2O3/MoO3 [8], BaCl2/CaO [14], CaCl2/calcium chloroapatite
and CaCl2/calcium chlorophosphate [24], M(alkali metal)-
ZrO2-Cl [17]. In the presence of Li/MgO [11] and Bi2O3/MoO3
[8], modiﬁed with lithium chloride, the percent contents of eth
ylene among C2 hydrocarbons reached values close to 100%.
Yet, in a considerable number of studies [9,12,16,18,
19,21–23,27] one may ﬁnd data which do not prove such a
clearly positive effect of the chloride modiﬁer—not all the
indexes of the OCM process were higher (or at least unchanged)
than on chloride-free catalysts. Although the presence of chlo-
ride ions in Li/SiO2 increased the selectivity of the reaction, the
amount of methane converted decreased [9]. A similar effect
was also obtained on catalyst Na/MnMgO containing chloride
ions when the yield of C2 hydrocarbons decreased [19]. In the
presence of LiCl/MgO, methane conversion and total selectivity
were higher than on Li2CO3/MgO, but the selectivity of ethylene
formation and the ethylene/ethane ratio on the former catalyst
were clearly lower than on the latter one [16]. An improve-
ment of all the indexes of the process was obtained only after
an additional introduction of bismuth oxychloride to the com-
position of the catalyst. In study [23], chlorinated perovskites
BaTiO3 and BaZrO3 ensured an increased selectivity to ethy-
lene and total selectivity but they failed to change, and even
decreased, the ethylene/ethane ratio, the degree of methane con-
version and the yield of C2+ hydrocarbons. Oxychloride SmOCl
made it possible to obtain a high ethylene/ethane ratio but with
a lower methane conversion and lower total selectivity of the
process than on Sm2O3 [22]. Lower methane conversion and
lower yield of hydrocarbons C2+ were obtained on catalysts
Li(or Na)-Na2MnO4 containing chloride ions [18]. The lat-
ter catalysts, in turn, allowed an unusually high selectivity to
hydrocarbons C3. In the presence of catalyst NaCl/CaO, the
conversions of both reagents, methane and oxygen, were lower
than with the application of other sodium compounds [21], with
a positive effect of NaCl on an increase of the total selectiv-
ity of the process and the selectivity of ethylene formation.
An increase in the ethylene/ethane ratio in the process prod-
ucts on such a catalyst became evident only with a fairly long
contact time of the reagents. A long contact time was the nec-
essary condition of obtaining a high ethylene/ethane ratio also
in study [22]. Increased conversion of methane in the presence
of catalysts NaCl/MnOx/SiO2 and NaCl/PbOx/SiO2, in com-
parison with analogous catalysts promoted with other sodium
compounds, depended on the reaction temperature and the com-
position of the reaction mixture [12]. In study [27], above
1023 K the OCM effects on catalyst Li/MgO containing chlo-
ride ions were poorer than on the unmodiﬁed catalyst. The
latter data imply that, for the products of the OCM process
carried out on catalysts modiﬁed with chloride ions, a signif-
icant role is played by the conditions under which it is carried
out.
Although less frequently, yet quite a negative effect of the
presence of chloride ions on the activity and selectivity of
catalysts of the OCM process was also observed. On cata-
lyst Na/CaO/MgAl2O4 [13], promoted with sodium chloride,
methane conversion, C2+ hydrocarbons yield and the selectiv-
ity of their formation were lower than on catalysts promoted
with sodium phosphate, carbonate or sulphate, though they were
higher than on the catalyst to which sodium was introduced in the
hydroxide form. The kind of the sodium compound introduced
to such catalysts had no signiﬁcant effect on the ethylene/ethane
ratio. The introduction of KCl instead of K2CO3 to MnOx did not
cause an increase in C2 hydrocarbons yield, and only an addition
of CHCl3 in the feedstock demonstrated the advantages of the
promoter (modiﬁer) of KCl, increasing C2 hydrocarbons yield
with an unchanged yield of carbon dioxide [15]. Lower conver-
sions of oxygen and methane, a lower yield of C2+ hydrocarbons
and the selectivity of their formation, as well as practically
unchanged selectivity to ethylene were obtained on NiO pro-
moted with NaCl and CsCl [7]. A clearly higher conversion of
methane and selectivity of ethylene formation were ensured only
by chloride ions introduced to NiO in the form of LiCl.
The number of studies in which the OCM process was exam-
ined with catalysts containing chloride ions is much greater than
those cited above but, because of lacking chloride-free standard
catalyst, one can hardly evaluate the real effects that could be
attributed to the presence of chloride ions.
Discrepancies similar to those reported above might
be found in the literature data in which gaseous chlorine
compounds were introduced into the reactor together with
methane and oxygen. Undoubtedly, positive effects included

It

usually a quantitatively higher effect than that caused by
chloride ions added directly to the catalyst. Such changes
were usually accompanied by an increase of total selec-
tivity and higher methane conversion. An analogous effect
was also caused by hydrogen chloride added in large
amounts to the methane–oxygen mixture [30,31]. In studies
[17,29–31,33–35,37,38,42,44,46] the parameters that deter-
mined the direction of changes in the values of reagents
conversion and process selectivity included: the kind of the
catalyst, temperature and concentration of chlorine compounds
in the feedstock. An addition of gaseous chlorine compounds
was sometimes neutral [17,30,31,33,38,46] or even making
worse some or all the effects of oxidative coupling of methane
[29,33–35,37,38,42,44,46]. A negative consequence, such as
a decrease in methane conversion and selectivity of ethylene
formation, resulted also from an addition of gaseous chlorine to
the feedstock [29].

It seems that discrepancies in the literature data which make
it impossible to unequivocally estimate the usefulness of mod-
ifying catalysts of the OCM process with chloride ions, may
result from a different nature of the examined catalysts, various
amounts of chloride ions introduced to the catalysts and vari-
ous reaction conditions under which the studies described above
were carried out. In study [25], Lunsford et al. showed that a
signiﬁcant increase of methane conversion and ethylene/ethane
ratio occurred only when Cl/Li atomic ratio in catalyst Li/MgO
wasclosetounity(theeffectsoftheOCMprocessinthepresence
of catalysts containing a higher amount of chloride ions were
not examined in that study). The same Cl/Li ratio ensured the
highest activity of Li/MgO also in the reaction of the oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethane [20].
This paper presents results of systematic studies in the effects
of chloride ions, introduced in a broad range of amounts to
catalyst Na/CaO, on the products of the oxidative coupling of
methane carried out in changeable – also in a wide range –
reaction conditions, including temperature, oxygen concentra-
tion and contact times of the reagents with the catalyst. The
aim of the study was to ﬁnd out if chloride ions really con-
stitute a positive modiﬁer of one of the simplest and cheapest
catalysts, yet which simultaneously exhibits good properties
in the OCM process (e.g. refs. [1–6]), as well as to deter-
mine at which chloride ions amounts in the catalyst and under
what conditions of the reaction one may expect positive effects
of their introduction to the catalyst, and how large are these
effects.
2. Experimental
The reaction catalysts were Na/CaO modiﬁed with chloride
ions. They were obtained by impregnation of calcium carbonate
(analytical grade, BDH Chemicals Ltd.) with aqueous solutions
of sodium carbonate (analytical grade, POCh Gliwice, Poland)
and appropriate amounts of ammonium chloride. After water
evaporation, the formed pastes were dried at 383 K. Dry pow-
ders of catalyst precursors were pelleted and crushed to a grain
size of the 0.75–1.2 mm. The catalysts were calcined in pure air
(70 cm3/min) at the temperature 1073 K for 1.5 h just prior to
the beginning of the reaction. The nominal content of deposited
sodium ions in all catalysts was 3 wt.% with respect to the weight
of calcium oxide and the experimentally determined contents of
the chloride ions in the calcined catalysts were varied from 0 to
11.08 wt.% (Table 1).
The contents of chloride ions in calcined catalysts were deter-
mined by X-ray ﬂuorescence spectroscopy technique. Pellets
for the XRF analysis were prepared by pressing catalysts pow-
der. The measurements were performed by the energy-dispersive
XRF spectrometer (Canberra) equipped with the liquid nitrogen-
cooled Si(Li) detector. The AXIL software package was used for
spectral deconvolution and for the calculation of the chloride
ions content.
BET total surface area of the catalysts in their oxide form
(after calcination) was measured by argon adsorption at the liq-
uid nitrogen temperature in a static-volumetric glass apparatus,
which ensured a vacuum better than 2 × 10−6 kPa.

X-ray powder diffraction patterns of calcined catalysts were
collected with an upgraded Zeiss HZG-4 diffractometer using
Ni-ﬁltered Cu K radiation. The samples were scanned by a
step-by-step technique, at 2θ intervals of 0.05◦and recording
time of 10 s for each step. The measured patterns were com-
pared with the JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction
Standards) database for phase identiﬁcation.
The reaction of oxidative coupling of methane was carried
out in a single pass of the reaction mixture through the quartz
ﬂow reactor. An internal diameter of the reactor was 10 mm and
behind the catalyst layer was narrowing down to 3 mm. Such
construction of the reactor enabled a rapid acceleration of the
linear rate of gas ﬂow to limit to a minimum the possibility of
secondary transformations of the reaction products beyond the
catalyst. The amount of the catalyst (W) in the reactor was 0.5 g.
The catalyst was mixed with quartz (0.75–1.2 mm grains) at the
ratio of 1:10 to warrant the constant temperature in the catalytic
layer. The reaction temperature, measured in the centre of the
catalyst + quartz bed, was adjusted from 973 to 1123 K. The con-
tent of oxygen in the methane + oxygen mixture was 4.76 vol.%
(the methane/oxygen ratio equalled 20/1) or 9.09 vol.% (the
methane/oxygen ratio equalled 10/1). The volumetric ﬂow rate
of the reaction mixture (F) was 75 or 150 cm3/min. The modi-
ﬁed contact time W/F was 0.4 or 0.2 s g/cm3. All effects of the
OCM process were collected at 0.5 h on-stream at the speciﬁed
reaction conditions.
The analysis of the reaction mixture and the reaction products
were performed by means of gas chromatography on Porapak Q
(allhydrocarbonsandcarbondioxide)usingFIDandTCDdetec-
tors coupled in series, and on molecular sieve 4A + 5A (oxygen)
employing TCD detector. In none of the experiments carbon
monoxide in the reaction products was detected. Chromato-
graphic calibration was carried out with the standard mixtures
containing hydrocarbons and other gases, whose concentrations
were comparable with those analysed. The oxygen and methane
conversions were calculated on the basis of their concentra-
tions before and after the reaction, with a correction introduced
for the change in gas volume during the reaction [50]. The
same correction was applied in calculations of the methane
conversion to the speciﬁc reaction products, i.e., the reaction
selectivity. The carbon mass balance was found to be close to
100 ± 2%.

3. Results
An introduction of a chloride modiﬁer to catalyst Na/CaO
caused a decrease in its activity in comparison with the unmod-
iﬁed catalyst which was manifested as a decrease in the
conversions of both reagents (Figs. 1 and 2). The decrease in the
conversion of both methane and oxygen was the deepest after the
introduction of small amounts of chloride ions. At lower temper-
atures of the process, their small amount was already sufﬁcient
to lower the activity, about 1 wt.% of Cl−at 973 K, than at higher
temperatures, about 4–5 wt.% of Cl−at 1123 K (Figs. 1 and 2).
Greater amounts of the modiﬁer caused no further changes in
the level of the conversion of both reagents.
The value of the decrease in oxygen conversion (Fig. 1)
depends on the conditions of the process of oxidative cou-
pling. The lower the temperature of the process and the
shorter the contact time of the reaction mixture with the cat-
alyst, the more signiﬁcant the decreases in oxygen conversion
caused by the presence of the chloride modiﬁer. Thus, for
instance, at 973 K, contact time 0.2 s g/cm3 and reagents ratio
CH4:O2 = 20:1, oxygen conversion decreases ﬁve times in com-
parison with the “clean” catalyst Na/CaO (from the level of
50 to 10%). On the other hand, at the same temperature and
the same oxygen content in the reaction mixture, but with a
longer contact time (0.4 s g/cm3), the degree of oxygen conver-

sion decreases only about three times (from the level of 65 to
20%).
In the case of the other reagent, methane, at the lower of the
applied temperatures the value of the conversion decrease in the
presence of chloride ions practically did not depend on the other
reaction conditions—by about 75 relative percent (Fig. 2). On
the other hand, at higher temperatures a signiﬁcant role is also
played by the contact time: at 1123 K and at W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3,
methane conversion decreases by about one-half (e.g. from 13.5
to 7% when the ratio CH4:O2 was 10:1), and at W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3
only by about 30 relative percent (e.g. from 12.5 to 8.5% at the
ratio CH4:O2 = 10:1).
A similar effect of chloride ions was observed in the case
of the yield of C2+ hydrocarbons formation (Fig. 3). The most
rapid drop in the yield was observed in the presence of small
amounts of chloride ions (till about 2 wt.%), especially at lower
temperatures of the coupling process. This fall was about 70
relative percent, regardless of the contact time and oxygen con-
centration in the reaction mixture. At the temperature of 973 K,
the highest yield of hydrocarbons C2+, on the level of 4.8%,
was obtained with the contact time W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3 and the
ratio CH4:O2 = 10:1, while the lowest yield of 3% was obtained
at W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3 and CH4:O2 = 20:1. Along with the rise of
the temperature of the process, the presence of chloride ions
in the catalyst caused smaller and smaller changes in the yield

of hydrocarbons C2+ in comparison with unmodiﬁed catalyst
Na/CaO. The smallest decreases in the yield were caused by
the chloride modiﬁer at the temperature of 1123 K, when at the
contact time W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3 the yield decreased by a half, and
at a longer contact time, W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3, by about 30 relative
percent. At this temperature, the highest yield of hydrocarbons
C2+ was observed at W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3 and CH4:O2 = 10:1 on
catalyst Na/CaO and it was 11%.
The effect of the chloride modiﬁer on total selectivity of C2+
hydrocarbons formation, which includes selectivities to the main
hydrocarbons (ethane and ethylene) and C3+ hydrocarbons, was
different (Fig. 4) from the observed effect on the degrees of
the conversion of the reagents and hydrocarbons yield. Already
small amounts of chloride ions (up to about 2 wt.%) caused a
considerable increase of the selectivity. When the higher is the
temperature of the oxidative coupling of methane, the increase is
higher. At the temperature of 973 K, the increases in total selec-
tivity were about 10 relative percents, regardless of the employed
conditions of the reaction. The highest values of the selectivity,
on the level of 87% on catalyst 2Cl-Na/CaO, were observed at
both applied contact times and at the lower oxygen content in the
reaction mixture (CH4:O2 = 20:1). Larger amounts of the chlo-
ride modiﬁer (above 2 wt.%) increased the total selectivity to a
smaller extent. At a high, 11% content of chloride ions, the total
selectivity of the process drops below the value characteristic

of chloride-free catalyst. Along with the increase in the temper-
ature of the OCM process, the values of total selectivity were
higher and higher, whereas its increases caused by the addition
of chloride ions to catalyst Na/CaO remained on the level of
about 10 relative percent. The highest selectivity of the forma-
tion of all hydrocarbons, on the level of 95%, at the temperatures
of 1073–1123 K, was obtained on catalyst 2Cl-Na/CaO at the
CH4:O2 ratio of 20:1. Also at these temperatures, the presence
of chloride ions in amounts over 2 wt.% causes smaller increases
in the values of the selectivity, yet it was always higher than that
obtained on “pure” catalyst Na/CaO.
Changes in the selectivity of the formation of ethane, which
take place after the introduction of chloride ions to catalyst
Na/CaO are very similar to those in total selectivity. The selec-
tivity of the formation of ethane (Fig. 5) increases after the
addition of small amounts, up to 2 wt.%, of the chloride mod-
iﬁer. For example, with the contact time W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3 and
the CH4:O2 ratio of 20:1 and at the temperature of 973 K, the
selectivity of the formation of ethane rises by about 20%, from
58 to 77%, while at the temperature of 1123 K and other con-
ditions remaining the same the selectivity rises from the level
of 37–42%. The contents of the chloride modiﬁer higher than
2 wt.% caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation of
ethane in comparison to that characteristic of the catalyst 2Cl-
Na/CaO. The decrease in the selectivity is smaller at higher

temperatures, and the selectivity obtained on catalyst 11Cl-
Na/CaO – under none of the applied reaction conditions – was
lower than that obtained on the unmodiﬁed catalyst Na/CaO.
The value of the selectivity of the formation of ethane was
also affected by the contact time and oxygen concentration in
the reaction mixture. On catalysts modiﬁed with chloride ions,
higher values of the selectivity were obtained with shorter con-
tact times and lower oxygen contents. In all of the applied
reaction conditions, the highest selectivity was obtained on cat-
alyst 2Cl-Na/CaO; for instance, at 973 K and the reagents ratio
of CH4:O2 = 20:1 and W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3, it was 80%, while at
W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3, it was 77.5%. At the temperature of 1123 K
and the same ratio of the reagents the selectivity of the for-
mation of ethane was 55% with W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3, while with
W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3 it was 42.5%.
The inﬂuence of chloride ions on all results of the OCM
process discussed so far was uniform, i.e., under all the reac-
tion conditions they caused either an increase in the value or its
decrease, or there occurred a maximum at about 2 wt.% contents
of chloride ions. In the case of the selectivity of the formation of
ethylene(Fig.6),theinﬂuenceofthemodiﬁerwasmorecomplex
and it signiﬁcantly depended on all the conditions of the reac-
tion of the coupling process. Regardless of the other reaction
conditions, at the temperatures of 973 and 1023 K, the addi-
tion of chloride ions in the amount of 1–2 wt.% to the catalyst

the oxidative coupling of methane.
Na/CaO caused a decrease in the selectivity of the formation
of ethylene to a level which remained constant also at higher
contents of the modiﬁer. The deepest decreases were observed
at the temperature of 973 K, e.g. with W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3 and
CH4:O2 = 10:1, after an introduction of 2 wt.% of chloride ions
the selectivity decreased from 17.5 to 9%. At the temperature
of 1073 K, the inﬂuence of chloride ions depends on the contact
time of the reaction mixture with the catalyst. With a shorter
contact time, W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3, the inﬂuence of the added mod-
iﬁer was the same as at lower temperatures—a small amount
of the modiﬁer caused a decrease in the selectivity of the for-
mation of ethylene. On the other hand, with a longer contact
time, W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3, the presence of the modiﬁer in amounts
up to 2 wt.% caused an increase in the selectivity and a greater
increase in the formation of this hydrocarbons was observed at
a higher content of oxygen in the reaction mixture. Under such
conditions, the selectivity rises from 34 to 40%. Still greater
amounts of chloride ions do not cause any further changes in
the value of the selectivity. At the temperature of 1123 K, the
direction of changes in the selectivity of the formation of ethy-
lene also depends on the concentration of oxygen in the reaction
mixture. With the ratio of the reagents CH4:O2 = 10:1, small
amounts of chloride ions increase the selectivity of the forma-
tion of ethylene. This increase is much larger in the case of a
longer contact time—from 39% on Na/CaO to 48% on modiﬁed

catalysts containing 2 wt.% and more of chloride ions. With the
ratio of the reagents CH4:O2 = 20:1, chloride ions also increase
the selectivity of the formation of ethylene but in this case a clear
peak in the selectivity was observed at 1% content of chloride
ions; with W/F = 0.2 s g/cm3, it was on the level 37.5% and with
W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3 the maximum selectivity reached the value
of 45%. In the case of the shorter contact time, the modiﬁer
in the amount above 2 wt.% caused a drop in the selectivity to
ethylene below the value obtained on the chloride-free catalyst
Na/CaO.
The large increase in the selectivity of the formation of ethane
with simultaneous multidirectional changes in the selectivity of
the process to ethylene cause that the percent content of the latter
hydrocarbon in fraction C2 is generally smaller in the presence
of modiﬁed catalysts than with chloride-free catalyst Na/CaO

of Na/CaO ethylene content in the sum total of C2 hydrocar-
bons is already small, below 25%, even very small amounts of
chloride ions decrease it still further by one-half. Raising the
temperature of the OCM process causes that the decrease in the
percent content of ethylene is smaller. At high temperatures of
the reaction, but only with a longer contact time, the presence
of chloride ions in the catalyst is neutral for the percent partic-
ipation of ethylene in the fraction of C2 hydrocarbons or, as at
1123 K and W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3, it causes its slight increase. With

the ratio of the reagents CH4:O2 = 20:1 there occurs a clear peak
of ethylene content with catalyst 0.5Cl-Na/CaO, whereas when
the CH4:O2 ratio was 10:1 also larger amounts of chloride ions
increased the percent content of ethylene. With that most advan-
tageous set of reaction conditions the C2 hydrocarbons fraction
formed on Na/CaO contained 57% of ethylene, while the mod-
iﬁcation of the catalyst with chloride ions increased its content
to 60%.
Apart from ethane and ethylene among the hydrocarbons
formed in the process of oxidative coupling of methane, there
are also C3+ hydrocarbons (propane, propylene and C4 hydro-
carbons). The selectivity of the conversion of methane to this
group of hydrocarbons is usually very small. In the experiments
described in this paper, it was always below 6%. The presence
of the chloride modiﬁer in catalyst Na/CaO decreases the selec-
tivity of the formation of C3+ hydrocarbons almost under all
conditions (Fig. 8). The chloride modiﬁer in the amount of up
to 2 wt.% very rapidly decreases the selectivity to C3+, while its
largeramountscausednofurtherchangesinthisselectivity.Only
at the temperature of 1123 K and contact time W/F = 0.4 s g/cm3,
regardless of oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture, were
the results of the OCM process different: under such conditions
a slight increase in the selectivity to C3+ in comparison with
unmodiﬁed catalyst Na/CaO was observed.

tivity in the oxidative coupling of methane.
Another product of the OCM process is also carbon diox-
ide. Chloride ions present in the catalyst Na/CaO in small
amounts, up to 2 wt.%, considerably limit complete oxidation of
hydrocarbons to CO2 (Fig. 9). Greater amounts of the modiﬁer,
above 2 wt.%, again intensify the participation of the complete
oxidation of hydrocarbons, whose result is an increase in the
selectivity of the formation of CO2. The values of the selec-
tivity of the formation of carbon dioxide complement the total
selectivity of the formation of hydrocarbons C2+ to 100%, and
the dependences shown in Fig. 9 constitute a mirror reﬂection of
those shown in Fig. 4 and thus do not require a more detailed pre-
sentation. Nevertheless, one should stress that the participation
of the processes of complete oxidation with catalysts modiﬁed
with chloride ions is very small; with catalysts 1Cl-Na/CaO and
2Cl-Na/CaO, this undesirable product is formed only from 5 to
10% of reacted methane.
4. Discussion
Figs. 1–9 show that the evaluation of the inﬂuence of the
chloride modiﬁer of catalyst Na/CaO on the products of the
oxidative coupling of methane must depend both on its content
in the catalyst and on all the parameters of the reaction, such as
temperature, oxygen concentration in the methane–oxygen feed-
stock and its time of contact with the catalyst. Only the role of
chloride ions is unequivocally negative in determining the activ-
ity of the catalyst—the value of the conversion of both reagents,
at every contents of the chloride modiﬁer, is always lower than
with the unmodiﬁed Na/CaO (Figs. 1 and 2). At the lower tem-
perature of the process, 973 K, there occurs a deep drop in the
conversion of oxygen and methane already in the presence of
very small amounts of chloride ions. Only at 1073–1123 K is
the decrease in the activity less rapid and smaller at analogous
contents of the modiﬁer. An evidently positive effect caused by
the chloride modiﬁer is an increase of the total selectivity of
the OCM process at each temperature, at each composition of
the reaction mixture, and with each time of its contact with the
catalyst (Fig. 4). Yet, this is true only about small amounts of
chloride ions. There is an optimum contents of chloride ions in
the catalyst, about 2 wt.%, at which the increase in the selec-
tivity of the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons is the largest in
comparison with the value obtained with the chloride-free cata-
lyst. This increase in the selectivity of the process towards C2+
hydrocarbons causes that in the presence of the modiﬁed cat-
alysts their yield does not drop so rapidly and greatly (Fig. 3)
as the decrease in methane conversion seems to suggest. The
selectivity of the formation of the most desirable product of the
OCM, i.e., ethylene, is only slightly improved at some condi-
tions of the reaction namely, at a high temperature of 1123 K
and – with a longer contact time – also at 1073 K (Fig. 6). Previ-
ously [21], a clear increase in the selectivity of the formation of
ethylene and the ratio of ethylene/ethane with a similar catalyst
NaCl/CaO, in comparison with calcium catalysts promoted with
other sodium compounds, was obtained at 1023 K only with a
very long contact time W/F close to 4.4 s g/cm3. Thus, catalyst
Na/CaO modiﬁed with chloride ions, though only with their
optimum contents of about 2 wt.%, may be recommended only
for a high-temperature process of oxidative coupling of methane
carried out with a fairly long time of contact of the reagents with
the catalyst, longer than in the case of unmodiﬁed Na/CaO. Oxy-
gen concentration in the reaction mixture may then be increased
(within the range allowed by the explosion limit), which would
ensure a greater yield of C2+ hydrocarbons and simultaneously
high general selectivity and selectivity of the formation of ethy-
lene. The longer time of contact of the reaction mixture with
the catalyst and higher contents of oxygen favour the successive
reaction in a series of intermediate stages of the OCM process,
i.e., oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
To some extent, the lower activity of catalysts modiﬁed with
chloride ions may result from their smaller surface area in com-
parison with the surface area of the chloride-free catalyst. Still,
this characteristic of the modiﬁed catalysts cannot be the only
cause of the gradual loss of activity and complex changes of
the selectivity of the process which take place when chloride
ions content changes; the value of the surface area of all these
catalysts is practically the same (Table 1).
The most probable cause of the modifying action of chlo-
ride ions is the poisoning of the catalyst surface by them and
decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. In conse-
quence, there decreases the rate of all the stages of the process
taking place with its participation, i.e., the activation of methane,
which is manifested as a decrease in the degree of the conversion

651
and successive transformations of hydrocarbons leading up to
their complete oxidation. Already very small amounts of chlo-
ride ions poison the most active sites on the catalyst surface
containing oxygen at which there occur ﬁrst of all processes of
the full oxidation of hydrocarbons. A similar suggestion may be
foundinstudy[17].Itwasalsonotedthatchlorideionsneutralize
the strong basicity of the surface of catalysts Li/MgO [25,27],
Na/CaO [21], BaCl2/CaO [14] or Na/MnMgO [19]. In cata-
lyst Li/MgO, small amounts of chloride ions are preferentially
sited at low coordinate sites [51] and an analogous localization
of chloride ions may be expected in catalyst Na/CaO. Study
[52] reported a lower activity of chloride-modiﬁed catalyst in
comparison with “pure” Na/CaO in the reaction of complete
oxidation of methane (2 vol.% methane in air). In the OCM pro-
cess, apart from reduction of the number of activated molecules
of methane and observed value of the degree of methane conver-
sion, the consequence of the decrease of surface concentration
of sites containing the active form of oxygen is a decrease of
the participation of complete oxidation of hydrocarbons to car-
bon dioxide, increase of the selectivity of the formation of C2+
hydrocarbons, including ethane, the primary reaction product
and at higher temperatures also ethylene.
Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst
surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are
formed ﬁrst CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons. Increas-
ing the content of the modiﬁer gradually poisons sites of lower
activity, leading to ever lower conversion of both reagents and
ever lower yield of the products of the OCM process. The intrin-
sic activity of Li-MgO-Cl catalysts for CH3 radicals generation
was lower than that of a normal Li-MgO catalyst [25]. A high
concentration of chloride ions probably causes no further block-
ing of surface active sites but creates new sites at which there
occurs complete oxidation of methane and ethane and of radi-
cals formed from them—this is implied by the decrease in the
selectivity of the reaction towards ethane (and of total selec-
tivity) and a constant level of selectivity towards ethylene and
C3+ hydrocarbons. At high contents of the modiﬁer, there are
formed even separate crystallographic phases of chlorinated cal-
cium compounds. XRD examinations showed the presence of
CaClOH (JCPDS 36-983) in catalyst 11Cl-Na/CaO. A much
smaller amount of this phase and its high dispersion did not
allow the demonstration of its presence (nor of crystallographic
phases containing sodium ions) in modiﬁed catalysts containing
smaller amounts of chloride ions. Large content of chloride ions
may cause the recrystallization of all the other components of
the catalyst and their segregation in separate, strongly dispersed
crystallographic phases. In such a situation, the phase of cal-
cium oxide may contain few (or none) sodium cations. Since
it is sodium ions, incorporated into the lattice of calcium oxide
constitute the most selective sites {Na+–O−} [1–5], enabling
the formation of CH3 radicals from methane and then of C2
hydrocarbons from them, the selectivity of the formation of
ethane, ethylene, C3+ hydrocarbons and thus, the total selec-
tivity of the process of oxidative coupling of methane in the
presence of catalysts containing large amounts of the chloride
modiﬁer, is smaller than at their optimal contents, i.e., about
2 wt.%.
The very rapid and deep decrease in the activity of the modi-
ﬁed catalysts at lower temperatures may result from the fact that
under such conditions the dominant participation in the course
of the process of the oxidative coupling of methane must belong
to the most active sites on the catalyst surface. Their poisoning
with small amounts of chloride ions practically stops the reac-
tion of methane with oxygen. At higher temperatures, at which
the reaction also occurs on the less active sites, still unpoisoned
with the small amount of the modiﬁer added to the catalyst,
the observed decrease of the conversion of both reagents and
hydrocarbons yield is small. Only the poisoning of also those
less active sites with large amounts of the modiﬁer considerably
inhibits the course of the OCM process also at higher temper-
atures. It seems that at high temperatures of the reaction, the
surface concentration of the active form of oxygen is still suf-
ﬁciently high to enable the possibility of intensive secondary
transformations of ethane to ethylene and, on subsequent stages,
to hydrocarbons C3+.
It is worth noticing that the optimum contents of about 2 wt.%
of chloride ions in catalyst Na/CaO, corresponding to the atomic
ratio Cl/Na equal to 0.85, is close to that established by Lunsford
et al. for catalyst Li/MgO used in the reactions of the oxida-
tive coupling of methane [25] and oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane [20]. So, it is possible to state that alkali metal and chlo-
ride ions should coexist in the optimal proportion on the catalyst
surface to achive the high selectivity of the oxidative coupling
of methane process.
The possible, disadvantageous aspect of the catalyst mod-
iﬁcation with chloride ions may be their slow “escape” from
the catalyst during the OCM long-lasting process. Such phe-
nomenon was already mentioned in some previous papers
[8,16,22,24,25]. Some potential reasons for the lose of chloride
ions are for example their reaction with oxygen (with gaseous
chlorineasaproduct)andatsubsequentstages,reactionsofchlo-
rine with water vapour and oxygen leading to hydrogen chloride.
In the presence of sodium promoter a fraction of its chlorides
may cover the catalyst surface. Because of the relatively low
melting point of NaCl (1074 K), the reaction between the melt
and water vapour may increase the amount of hydrogen chloride
liberated at high temperatures of the OCM. The latter chlorine-
containing product may also be formed directly in the reaction of
surface chloride ions with methane. Those undesirable reactions
are not very rapid but during the long-lasting OCM process they
may affect the content of chlorides in the catalyst. In order to pre-
vent diminishing in amounts of chloride ions in the catalyst, the
continuous addition of gaseous chlorine-containing compounds
in their very small concentrations to the methane–oxygen feed-
stock may be recommended. It should allow some chloride ions
to be deposited on the catalyst [47] and replace the lost chlorides,
maintaining their optimal amounts on the catalyst surface.
5. Conclusions
The results of the presented studies have shown that only
small amounts of chloride ions introduced into catalyst Na/CaO
may be recommended for an improvement of the effects of
oxidative coupling of methane. There is an optimum contents
652

of chloride ions in catalyst Na/CaO—about 2 wt.%. At this con-
tent of the modiﬁer, the selectivities of the formation of ethane,
ethylene and C3+ hydrocarbons, which all constitute the total
selectivity of the process, reach the highest values, higher than
those obtained with chloride-free catalyst; the complete oxida-
tion of hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide is maximally restricted.
But after such a modiﬁcation of the catalyst, the OCM process
must be carried out at higher temperatures. The other condi-
tions of the reaction should also contribute to the course of
the oxidative coupling of methane on less active sites of the
surface—oxygen concentration in the reaction mixture should
be high (within the range allowed by the explosion limit) and
its time of contact with the catalyst should be longer than in the
case of unmodiﬁed Na/CaO. The latter parameters are especially
important for the formation of ethylene.
The role of the chloride modiﬁer seems to consist in poi-
soning the catalyst surface and decreasing the number of sites
with active oxygen, which in consequence leads mainly to an
exclusion of the most active of these sites from methane trans-
formations.
