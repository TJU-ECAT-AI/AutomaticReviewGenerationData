Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin ﬁlms were prepared on the Au(1 1 1) surface and characterized using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Fe3O4 was formed by
annealing a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures on Au(1 1 1) at 750 K in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) for 60 min. Trans-
formation of the a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures into Fe3O4 nanoparticles and thin ﬁlms was supported by
XPS. STM images show that during the growth procedure used, Fe3O4 initially appears as nanoparticles
at low coverages, and forms thin ﬁlms at 2 monolayer equivalents (MLE) of iron. Two types of ordered
superstructures were observed on the Fe3O4 particles with periodicities of 50 and 42 Å, respectively.
As the Fe3O4 particles form more continuous ﬁlms, the 50 Å feature was the predominant superstruc-
ture observed. The Fe3O4 structures at all coverages show a hexagonal unit cell with a 3 Å periodicity in
the atomically resolved STM images.

1. Introduction
Iron and iron-oxide based catalysts are important materials uti-
lized in many industrial processes, such as the Fischer–Tropsch
reaction, the synthesis of styrene, and gas-sensing applications
[1–3]. Iron has two variable oxidation states, Fe2+ and Fe3+, and
forms three natural oxides with different stoichiometries and crys-
tal structures: FeO (wüstite), Fe3O4 (magnetite), and a-Fe2O3
(hematite) [4]. There are also two other artiﬁcially synthesized oxi-
des, known as c-Fe2O3 (maghemite) and e-Fe2O3, respectively [4].
The chemical and catalytic properties of iron-oxide depend on
the speciﬁc phase of the oxides which are dictated by the oxidation
states and associated crystal structures. This difference is illus-
trated by the experimental observation that Fe3O4(1 1 1) and a-
Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) are capable of chemically adsorbing ethylbenzene
and styrene, whereas FeO(1 1 1) is inert toward both molecules
[1]. In addition, a-Fe2O3 is the most active oxide for the dehydro-
genation of ethylbenzene to styrene among all the studied Fe-oxide
phases [1].
There have been many studies on Fe-oxide single crystals [5–
14]. Epitaxial Fe-oxide thin ﬁlms have also been grown on single
crystal metal surfaces, including Pt(1 1 1) [15–21] and Ru(0 0 0 1)
[22]. Depending on the growth conditions such as O2 pressure, oxi-
dation temperature and Fe coverage, one can prepare ﬁlms of
FeO(1 1 1), Fe3O4(1 1 1), and a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) on these single crys-
tal surfaces. The growth of epitaxial Fe-oxide thin ﬁlms on metal
surfaces is motivated by some of the technical problems some-
times associated with using the single crystal oxides, such as the
presence of uncontrolled impurities and low conductivities. A pho-
toemission study has suggested that these iron oxide thin ﬁlms are
indeed electronically equivalent to the corresponding bulk materi-
als [16].
Recently, we have demonstrated the selective growth and char-
acterization of FeO(1 1 1) and a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) nanoparticles and
thin ﬁlms on the herringbone reconstructed Au(1 1 1) surface
[23,24]. The FeO nanoparticles adopt a two-dimensional, bilayer
structure consisting of Fe(1 1 1) and O(1 1 1) planes [23], while
the a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles have a more three-dimensional struc-
ture with an O-terminated (0 0 0 1) surface [24]. In comparison
to studies on low-index and stepped Fe-oxide single crystals, the
nanoparticles grown on metal surfaces serve as ‘‘model” catalysts
which preserve many important features of real catalysts, namely
edges, kinked steps, missing atoms, and other structural defects.
These features can be difﬁcult to reproduce in single crystal sys-
tems and are critical factors which govern the reactivity of real
world heterogeneous catalysts.
In the present work, we demonstrate the preparation and char-
acterization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and ﬁlms on Au(1 1 1). We are
interested in Fe3O4 because it is believed to be a key intermediate

in the transformation of Fe2O3 into the Fe-carbides which are pro-
posed to be the active phase in Fe-based Fischer–Tropsch catalysts
[25]. This transformation is believed to occur when Fe2O3 is re-
duced to Fe3O4 with the help of Cu or K promoters, which is then
carburized into Fe-carbide. The ﬁnal Fischer–Tropsch catalyst is a
complex, heterogeneous, mixture of Fe, Fe-oxides, Fe-carbides, Cu
and/or K promoters, and other structural additives. Thus, the suc-
cessful production of Fe3O4 nanoparticles may provide a platform
to study Fe-carbide formation and to characterize its structure
and reactivity of Fe-carbide materials using an assortment of sur-
face science techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
We show that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles can be prepared by
reducing a-Fe2O3 through a simple ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
annealing procedure. The UHV annealing reduces oxides by remov-
ing or desorbing oxygen from the system. Recently, the reduction
of MoO3 nanostructures grown on Au(1 1 1) was achieved by
annealing the oxide in UHV at 650 K, generating one-dimensional
oxygen vacancies associated with the formation of an Mo5+ state
[26]. In our current work, the reduction of a-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 has
been proposed and is supported by XPS. STM has also been used
to characterize the morphology of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles formed
during this reduction. The effect of Fe3O4 coverage on the morphol-
ogy of the particles and ﬁlms is also presented in this work.
2. Experimental method
All experiments were performed in a commercial UHV chamber
from Omicron Nanotechnology GmbH. This chamber is equipped
with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and
low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) [23]. The base pressure was main-
tained at 3  1010 mbar.
The growth and characterization of a-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and
ﬁlms on Au(1 1 1) has been described in detail elsewhere [24]. In
this work, we used a slightly modiﬁed procedure. Brieﬂy, prior to
iron deposition, the Au(1 1 1) surface (Princeton Scientiﬁc Corp.)
was cleaned by cycles of Ar+ sputtering (P = 1  106 mbar,
1.5 keV) at 300 K, followed by annealing at 700 K for 10 min. Iron
was then deposited on the clean Au(1 1 1) surface at room temper-
ature
using
an
electron-beam
assisted
evaporator
(Omicron
EFM3T) from a rod material (Good fellow, 2.0 mm, 99.99%), fol-
lowed by heating in NO2 (directly introduced on the sample plate
through a 1
=
4 stainless steel tube, chamber pressure during dosing
3  108 mbar) from room temperature to 700 K (heating rate
0.3 K/s). NO2 (research grade) was used as received and without
further puriﬁcation.
The coverage of a-Fe2O3 on Au(1 1 1) is noted as a monolayer
equivalent of Fe (MLE), referring to the atomic ratio of Fe and Au
(only the surface Au atoms are taken into account) used to make
the oxide. We also refer to the Fe3O4 formed from the a-Fe2O3
using this deﬁnition of coverage. The MLE coverage was deter-
mined from the XPS data collected during Fe deposition on the
clean Au(1 1 1) surface. Corrections to the XPS data were made
for the atomic sensitivity factors (ASF) and the inelastic mean free
path (IMFP), as described in our previous study [24].
XPS measurements were collected using an Mg Ka X-ray source
(1253.6 eV, 300 W) and a hemispherical analyzer with pass energy
of 20 eV at room temperature. The binding energy (BE) was cali-
brated by Au 4f7/2 = 83.8 eV for each spectrum. All STM measure-
ments were performed at room temperature in constant current
mode using etched W tips. The STM was calibrated using the steps
on Au(1 1 1) and the literature value for the height of these steps of
2.4 Å [27,28]. All STM images were processed using the Scanning
Probe Imaging Processor (SPIP) brand software including plane
corrections.
3. Results and discussion
The morphology of the a-Fe2O3 structures grown on Au(1 1 1) is
shown in Fig. 1a. Brieﬂy, a-Fe2O3 adopts a three-dimensional struc-
ture with a height of 5 Å. At the coverage of 1 MLE, most of the a-
Fe2O3 particles coalesce to form irregularly shaped islands, with
boundaries showing contrast differences in the STM image; while
a small portion still appear as individual particles. According to
our previous study [24], these a-Fe2O3 structures appear to have
an O-terminated (0 0 0 1) surface, showing a hexagonal unit cell
with a lattice constant of 3 Å in the atomically resolved STM
images.
Fig. 2a shows the XP spectra of the Fe 2p and O 1s regions of 1
MLE a-Fe2O3 grown on Au(1 1 1). The binding energy (BE) of the Fe
2p3/2 peak is located at 710.9 eV, in agreement with the literature
value of a-Fe2O3 [29,30]. More importantly, the shakeup satellite
peak at 719 eV (marked with a dashed line in the Fe 2p region),
a characteristic for the Fe3+ species [31] typically seen in Fe2O3,
is present in the XP spectrum. The O 1s peak is located at
529.7 eV. The atomic ratio of O and Fe is estimated to be 1.5:1,
based on integrated XPS signal intensities after taking the atomic
sensitivity factors (ASF) into account, consistent with the a-Fe2O3
stoichiometry.
The morphology changes after annealing the a-Fe2O3 structures
at 750 K for 10 min. Although most structures still appear as irreg-
ularly shaped islands on Au(1 1 1), the structures have sharper and
straighter edges than before this annealing step (Fig. 1b). Most

XPS measurements. Image sizes are 100  100 nm2.

noticeably, the larger structures display an ordered hexagonal
superstructure, as is highlighted with a circle in Fig. 1b. This or-
dered superstructure was not seen in our previous work on a-
Fe2O3, and is thus presumed to be caused by the additional anneal-
ing step.
A more noticeable change was observed by STM after the a-
Fe2O3 structures were annealed at 750 K for 30 min (Fig. 1c). Spe-
ciﬁcally, most of the oxide structures adopt an irregular hexagonal
shape (six unequal length sides) with some structures taking on a
more complex shape. The structures in Fig. 1c have a very broad
size distribution, varying from a few nanometers to tens of nano-
meters, but all have sharp and straight edges. The structures in
Fig. 1c also display the ordered hexagonal superstructure noted
in Fig. 1b.
The XP spectra indicate that the a-Fe2O3 structures grown on
Au(1 1 1) are partially reduced after annealing at 750 K for
30 min. Speciﬁcally, the Fe 2p3/2 peak is broader in comparison
to that of a-Fe2O3 (Fig. 2b), mainly due to the increasing intensity
in the lower BE region (709 eV). In addition, the satellite peak of
Fe3+ at 719 eV also becomes less visible. As suggested in the liter-
ature [1,12], these results would indicate, although qualitatively,
that a lower oxidation state of Fe2+ is produced in the particles dur-
ing the annealing steps. This interpretation is also consistent with
the slightly lowered intensity observed for the O 1s peak (Fig. 2b).
It should be noted that the BE of the O 1s peak also shifts +0.4 to
530.1 eV, in comparison to the data collected on a-Fe2O3.
The XPS data shows that the oxide continues to be reduced dur-
ing longer annealing times at 750 K. After 60 min, the Fe 2p3/2 peak
becomes much broader because of increasing intensities at both
the lower and higher BE regions (Fig. 2c). The intensity changes
at lower BE region (709 eV) are indicative of Fe2+; whereas the
changes in the higher BE region (marked with a solid arrow in
the Fe 2p region) are associated with a satellite excitation of the
Fe2+ species [32]. Both sets of intensity changes are attributable
to an increasing Fe2+ concentration. After 60 min of annealing,
the satellite peak associated Fe3+ state (719 eV) becomes difﬁcult
to see, likely due to decreasing Fe3+ concentrations and the increas-
ing intensity from the Fe2+ satellite excitation. The O 1s peak stays
at 530.1 eV after 60 min of annealing, but its intensity continues to
decrease. There is no further change observed after annealing at
750 K for 120 min (data not shown), meaning that the structures
have reached a steady state at these conditions. The changes in
the XP spectra that we attribute to the formation of Fe3O4 are more
prominent at higher coverages and are illustrated and discussed
below.
The XPS results for the reduction of a-Fe2O3 are quantiﬁed and
summarized in Fig. 3. The atomic ratio of Fe to Au (also known as a
monolayer equivalent (MLE) of Fe as deﬁned in Section 2) remains
constant, suggesting that there is no loss of Fe species during the
annealing steps. Fig. 3 shows that the atomic ratio of O to Fe de-
creases monotonically with annealing time, dropping from 1.5
(the stoichiometric value of a-Fe2O3) to 1.4 (after 30 min anneal-
ing). The atomic ratio of O to Fe reaches a ratio of 1.3 after 60 min
of annealing and remains the same thereafter.

On the basis of the XPS data and literature results for single
crystal studies [6,8,12], we propose that the a-Fe2O3 structures
grown on Au(1 1 1) are transformed into Fe3O4 by annealing
in
UHV
at
750 K.
Previous
studies
have
reported
that
an
Fe3O4(1 1 1) overlayer can be formed on single crystal a-Fe2O3-
(0 0 0 1) after annealing in UHV or in low partial pressures of O2
[6,8,12]. In those works, the epitaxial growth of one Fe-oxide phase
on another is facilitated by the crystallographic similarity between
Fe3O4 and a-Fe2O3; namely the closed-packed oxygen layers lying
parallel to a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) are crystallographically similar to the
closed-packed oxygen layers parallel to Fe3O4(1 1 1), as illustrated
in the literature [8]. The a-Fe2O3 structures in our work consist
of only two or three layers of (0 0 0 1) O-planes with a total height
of 5 Å [24]. The reduced thickness of these structures suggests
that the more complete transformation of the a-Fe2O3 structures
into Fe3O4 could be expected versus a condition of one Fe-oxide
phase growing epitaxially on top of another. Our XPS results (Figs.
2 and 3) are all consistent with the interpretation that the reduc-
tion
to
Fe3O4
could
be
complete
under
our
experimental
conditions.
The STM images of 1 MLE Fe3O4 on Au(1 1 1) (prepared from the
annealing of 1 MLE a-Fe2O3 at 750 K for 120 min) are displayed in
Fig. 4. Most of the Fe3O4 structures adopt an irregular hexagonal
shape with sizes varying from a few nanometers to tens of nano-
meters (Fig. 4a). The large Fe3O4 structures usually appear with or-
dered hexagonal superstructures on the surface. After careful
examination of the STM data, these Fe3O4 structures have two,
slightly different, heights, which are shown by the examples
marked as structures 1 and 2 in Fig. 4a. Structure 1 (apparent
height 6 Å) seems to be representative of a majority of the fea-
tures in Fig. 4a, and is about 1 Å lower than structure 2 (apparent
height 7 Å), as demonstrated by linescans (Fig. 4b).

grown a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures on Au(1 1 1) at 750 K for 120 min.

The enlarged images of structures 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 4c
and d, respectively. Both structures adopt an irregular hexagonal
shape with a size of 20 nm. They both present an ordered hexag-
onal superstructure (marked with a blue and a red unit cell on each
structure, respectively), each with different periodicities. Structure
1 (shorter feature) has a larger periodicity (50 Å) while structure
2 (higher feature) has a smaller periodicity (42 Å).
Despite the differences mentioned above, both structures 1 and
2 have a similar atomic structure, as shown in Fig. 4e and f. Both
structures show a hexagonal unit cell with a periodicity of 3 Å
in the atomically resolved STM images. Some defects may also be
present on both surfaces, appearing as deep depressions in the
STM images (marked with arrows in Fig. 4e and f). The ordered
superstructures for both classes of particles are still clearly visible,
as highlighted by the dashed triangles in these atomically resolved
images.
In addition to data at 1 MLE, we have also investigated higher
coverages. At the coverage of 2 MLE, XPS results conﬁrm that the
annealing step also leads to the reduction of a-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, sig-
niﬁed by the broadening of the Fe 2p3/2 peak and the diminishing
of the Fe3+ satellite peak (Fig. 5a). The higher coverage used in
Fig. 5a makes the XPS changes described with the reduction of a-
Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 in Fig 2a far more pronounced. In particular, the loss
of the Fe3+ satellite and the broadening of the Fe 2p3/2 peak are
more discernable. STM images of a coverage of 2 MLE shows that
Fe3O4 forms continuous ﬁlms with visible boundaries (Fig. 5b).
There are also small regions of the surface which are missing
Fe3O4 and the Au(1 1 1) growth substrate is visible. The 2 MLE ﬁlm
shows an ordered hexagonal superstructure with a periodicity of
50 Å (Fig. 5c), the same as was observed for structure 1 in
Fig. 4c. Structure 2 from Fig. 4 with a periodicity of 42 Å was
not observed at this coverage even after checking several different
spots on the Au(1 1 1) crystal. However, the presence of structure 2
at this coverage cannot be completely ruled out because of the
localized nature of STM imaging. The atomically resolved images
from the 2 MLE ﬁlm also show a hexagonal lattice with a periodic-
ity of 3 Å (Fig. 5d).
Fe3O4 has an inverse spinel structure with cubic closed-packed
O anions forming planes perpendicular to the (1 1 1) direction [4].
The average O–O spacing within the (1 1 1) planes is 2.97 Å. The Fe
cations are located in the interstitial sites distributed as eight Fe2+
and eight Fe3+ ions in octahedral holes of the O sublattice, and eight
Fe3+ ions in tetrahedral holes within a unit cell. There are two pos-
sible Fe-terminations, noted as Kagomé and mix-trigonal layers,
respectively [1], and both terminations have an identical inter-
atomic Fe–Fe distance of 5.94 Å. The measured hexagonal lattice
with a periodicity of 3 Å suggests that the oxygen atoms in
Fe3O4(1 1 1) were imaged under the tunneling conditions used in
our STM study. We caution against concluding that these Fe3O4
materials have an O-terminated surface based solely on the oxygen
lattice imaged in our STM results since tunneling conditions and
tip interactions can cause imaging of sub-surface states as has been
seen previously for STM studies of Fe2O3 ﬁlms and surfaces. More
detailed computational studies and experiments such as dynamical
LEED analysis and ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) measurements
similar to those conducted for the Fe2O3 system [1,9] will be
needed to conclusively determine the surface termination of the
Fe3O4 materials studied here.
Studies from both single crystal Fe3O4(1 1 1) and the nominally
Fe3O4(1 1 1) terminated a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) system have determined
the surface to be an Fe-termination, and a hexagonal unit cell of
6 Å (corresponding to the Fe atom periodicity) has been observed
in the atomically resolved STM images [6,33]. If the Fe3O4(1 1 1)
structures prepared in our work were indeed terminated by Fe,
the differences of the atomic images between our work and those
single crystal works could come from the different tunneling

conditions used in each study, resulting in imaging of different
states. Likewise, it could be attributed to the reduced dimension
of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and ﬁlms supported on the Au(1 1 1)
substrate, resulting in modiﬁed electronic states compared to the
bulk materials.
Note that two types of hexagonal superstructures with distinct
periodicities (50 and 42 Å, respectively) have been identiﬁed in
the study. The hexagonal superstructure with a 42 Å periodicity
seems to match the dimensions of the so-called biphase structure
observed on sputtered and annealed a-Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) in the litera-
tures [1,34]. It was recently suggested to result from as a simple
hex-on-hex overlayer: a thin Fe3O4-type layer at or near the a-
Fe2O3 surface [12]. There are no reports in the literature of observing
the hexagonal superstructure of 50 Å which indeed is a signiﬁcant
feature of this work. More studies, including the theoretical efforts,
will be needed to the sort out the origins of this superstructure.
4. Conclusion
Fe3O4
has
been
formed
on
Au(1 1 1)
by
annealing a-
Fe2O3(0 0 0 1) structures in UHV at 750 K. The reduction to Fe3O4
has been proposed in comparison with the literature results and
been supported by XPS, showing a broadened Fe 2p3/2 peak due
to the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species, and a decreased
atomic ratio of O and Fe (from 1.5 to 1.3). STM characterization
of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and ﬁlms shows that Fe3O4 appears as
particles on Au(1 1 1) at the coverages below 1 MLE, adopting an
irregular hexagonal shape with sharp edges. At coverages of 2
MLE, most of the Au(1 1 1) has been covered with a Fe3O4 thin ﬁlm.
While two ordered hexagonal superstructures with periodicities of
50 and 42 Å have been observed on large Fe3O4 particles, the
50 Å periodicity is the dominant superstructure observed on the
continuous Fe3O4 thin ﬁlms. A hexagonal lattice with a periodicity
of 3 Å has been observed in the atomically resolved STM images
at all coverages of Fe3O4, suggesting that the oxygen atoms in
Fe3O4(1 1 1) are being imaged.
