Abstract
Two-dimensional (2D) FeO nanoislands with a well-controlled size, density, and surface structure have been grown on Pt(111) by a two-step preparation process, which consists of Fe deposition at low temperatures, such as 150 K, in an O2 atmosphere and subsequent annealing at elevated temperatures in ultrahigh vacuum. The atomic structure, chemical composition, and electronic state of the formed FeO nanoislands were investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. The formation of the metastable 2D FeO surface phase can be attributed to confinement effects at interfaces between nanostructured oxides and metal substrates, which originate from the strong interaction between FeO and Pt(111). Furthermore, the STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopic data indicate that the formed PtFeO boundaries or edges of the FeO nanoislands present distinct chemical and electronic characteristics, which could be highly active in many catalytic processes.

1 Introduction
Metal oxides are widely used as catalysts or catalyst supports in many industrial reaction processes. Understanding the role of oxides in catalytic reactions is one of the most important tasks in heterogeneous catalysis research. Nanostructured oxides can be grown on metal substrates and form ultrathin films, nanoislands, or nanoclusters. Metal-supported oxide nanostructures present ideal model surfaces to study the structurereactivity relationships in oxide catalysis. (1-5)
Ultrathin oxide films with a thickness of a monolayer (ML) or a few monolayers grown on conducting supports could circumvent the charging effect encountered in bulk oxides. The surface structure and thickness of these oxide films can be controlled at the atomic scale. They serve as ideal supports for metal deposition and allow investigations of the model catalysts using most of the surface techniques. (6-9) Well-ordered oxide films, such as Al2O3/NiAl(110), (10) FeO/Pt(111), (2, 11-15) MgO/Mo(100), (16, 17) and SiO2/Pd(100), (18) have been extensively studied in past decades. Additionally, planar oxide nanoislands or nanoclusters with coverage of a submonolayer can be grown on metal surfaces to form the so-called inverse model systems. (4) Oxide nanoislands, such as vanadium oxides, (4, 19) ceria, (20, 21) MoO3, (22, 23) and iron oxides, (1, 24-26) have been deposited on noble metal surfaces. Coordinatively unsaturated metal sites at edges of the nanoislands or nanoclusters are often regarded as active sites in catalytic oxidation reactions. (1, 22, 27)
In the metal-supported two-dimensional (2D) oxide nanostructures, the formed metaloxide interfaces play an important role in the surface physical and chemical properties. For example, the interfaces between the ultrathin oxide films and the metal supports could affect the reactivity of metal catalysts grown on the oxide surfaces. (3) In the systems of metal-supported oxide nanoislands, the peripheries of oxide nanoislands, that is, the metaloxide boundaries, are often controlling catalytic reactions. (1, 20, 28) To study the critical role of the metaloxide interfaces on the surface reactions, it is highly demanding to prepare the 2D oxide nanostructures with the desired structure, morphology, and size. In the past decades, many attempts have been made to achieve the well-controlled growth of 2D oxide nanoparticles and clusters on the surfaces of metals or oxides. For example, planar vanadium oxide clusters were formed on Rh(111) by deposition of V at the submonolayer under specific substrate temperatures and oxidizing conditions. (29) 2D MoO3 nanoislands were deposited on Au(111) by vapor deposition of Mo and subsequent oxidation in an oxidant atmosphere. (22, 23) Recently, FeO was grown on Au(111) by exposing Fe overlayers to O2 at room temperature (RT), followed by annealing at elevated temperatures, and the reconstructed Au(111) surface serves as an ideal template to grow the highly dispersed 2D FeO nanoislands. (24)
The widely used routes to preparing the supported nanostructured oxides, including oxidation of alloy surfaces, evaporation of metals under oxidant atmospheres at evaporation of metals followed by postoxidation, (8, 14, 30, 31) often need high temperatures, which cause less controlling of the oxide growth. In this paper, we present a two-step growth method to prepare nanostructured FeO on Pt(111), which consists of deposition of Fe in an O2 atmosphere at low temperatures (LTs) and subsequent annealing at intermediate temperatures (<700 K) in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). The obtained FeO/Pt(111) surfaces were characterized by various surface techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The results indicate that FeO nanoislands can be grown on Pt(111) with a well-controlled structure and size. This two-step growth process may present as a general approach to prepare other nanostructured oxides on metals.
2 Experimental Section
Most of the experiments were performed in an Omicron multiple-chamber UHV system, which is equipped with a hemispherical energy analyzer (Omicron EA125 5-channeltron) for XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), a variable-temperature STM (Omicron VT STM/AFM), a high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS, LK ELS5000), a photoemission electron microscope (PEEM) (Focus IS-PEEM), and an independent chamber for sample preparation. (32, 33) The base pressure in the UHV system is less than 2.0 × 1010 mbar. XPS spectra were acquired using Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation, and the spectra were calibrated using the binding energy (BE) of Fe 2p3/2 at 707.0 eV from multilayer Fe films on Pt(111). The HREELS spectra were taken in the specular direction with an incident angle of 60 with respect to the surface normal and the primary electron energy of 4.05 eV. STM images were recorded in constant current mode using a W tip at RT.
Single-crystal Pt(111) was cleaned by repeated Ar+ sputtering (2 keV, 30 μA) and UHV annealing (1050 K) until no contamination was detected by XPS and STM. Fe was evaporated via resistive heating of a tungsten filament (99.95% purity, Johnson Matthey) wrapped with Fe wire (99.998% purity, Johnson Matthey). Before deposition, the Fe source has been fully degassed. The coverage of Fe or FeO overlayers grown on Pt(111) was determined by STM, and the flux for Fe evaporation is about 0.125 ML/min. Here, 1 ML Fe or FeO means the mount of Fe that forms a FeO film covering fully the Pt(111) surface. (31) During deposition, the sample temperature can be varied from 150 to 1000 K, and the chamber could be filled with gas, such as O2, up to 5 × 106 mbar. The gas was introduced into the vacuum by backfilling the chamber. Exposures were given in Langmuir (1 L = 1 × 106 Torr·s), which is uncorrected for ion gauge sensitivity.
Low-temperature (LT) STM images were recorded using another Omicron LT STM system, which also includes an independent chamber for sample cleaning and Fe evaporation. STM and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) were conducted at liquid N2 (LN2) or liquid He temperatures.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Growth of FeO Nanoislands
FeO overlayers were prepared by a two-step process, which includes evaporation of Fe on Pt(111) at LT in an O2 environment and postannealing to certain temperatures in UHV. The fabrication of FeO is critically dependent on the growth parameters, such as substrate temperature, O2 partial pressure, postannealing temperature, and FeO coverage. Their effects on the growth of FeO overlayers were investigated in detail.
The influence of the substrate temperature on FeO growth is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Four FeO overlayers with the same nominal coverage of 0.25 ML were grown on Pt(111) at different substrate temperatures under 1.3 × 107 mbar O2 and subsequently warmed to RT in UHV. XPS Fe 2p spectra from the surfaces are displayed in Figure 1. All of the surfaces present the similar Fe 2p intensities, indicating the identical coverage of Fe. The Fe 2p3/2 BEs are all located at 709.3 eV, which is characteristic of Fe2+ species. STM images of the FeO/Pt(111) surfaces are shown in Figure 2. In the case of the RT growth, most of FeO nanoislands are found on the Pt terraces with a size around 30 nm. Some smaller islands aggregate along the steps (Figure 2a). If FeO was deposited at 250 K, the oxide islands are highly dispersed on the surface with the island size around 10 nm (Figure 2b). The even lower deposition temperatures, for example, 200 and 150 K, result in much higher island dispersion (Figure 2c,d). The height of the FeO nanoislands grown at the different temperatures is always a monolayer. The image in Figure 2b shows that periodic bright dots were clearly discerned on the FeO nanoislands. A similar structure also appears when annealing the FeO nanoislands deposited at 200 and 150 K in UHV above 473 K. This surface structure is characteristic for well-ordered monolayer FeO on Pt(111), as we will discuss below.

From the STM images shown in Figure 2, we can see that the FeO nanoislands homogeneously nucleate on the surface except for the case of RT growth. For the homogeneous nucleation growth process, the saturation density of nuclei number N is dependent on the vapor flux F and the diffusion coefficient D. We have the following proportionality: (7)
(1)
The diffusion coefficient D can be written as
(2)
where Ediff is the activation energy for diffusion, ν is the prefactor, a is the distance between two adjacent adsorption sites, T is the temperature, and R is the gas constant, 8.314 kJ/mol. The growth of FeO nanoislands between 150 and 250 K is in the regime of the homogeneous nucleation. The number densities (N) derived from the STM images of Figure 2bd are 0.64 × 1012/cm2, 1.00 × 1012/cm2, and 2.39 × 1012/cm2, respectively. The plot of ln(N) versus 1/T is a straight line (Figure 3), which yields a constant slope of Ediff/2R. The derived Ediff is 8.26 kJ/mol, which is quite low, almost equal to R. Therefore, it is expected that the diffusion coefficient is highly sensitive to temperature. At or above RT, Fe and O species have a high diffusion coefficient such that they prefer to nucleate at steps or terrace defects. The low diffusion activation energy for Fe and O species on Pt(111) may explain why, at high temperatures, FeO tends to form submonolayer films rather than dispersed nanoislands in the regime of submonolayer coverage.

Next, the effect of O2 partial pressure on the FeO growth is highlighted. Figure 4 displays XPS Fe 2p spectra of 0.25 ML FeO (Fe) overlayers deposited on Pt(111) at 150 K but in various O2 atmospheres and subsequently warmed to RT in UHV. The data indicate that the samples prepared in 1.3 × 108, 1.3 × 107, and 1.3 × 106 mbar O2 have Fe 2p3/2 BEs at 709.3 eV. However, the sample produced in 5.2 × 109 mbar O2 has a Fe 2p3/2 BE at 707.8 eV. Moreover, the weak O Auger peak (KLL) demonstrates that there is little oxygen on this surface. Therefore, a 5.2 × 109 mbar O2 atmosphere is not enough to oxidize the evaporated Fe but only produces metallic Fe on Pt(111). The morphology of the sample prepared under 5.2 × 109 mbar O2 is also sharply different than the other surfaces (Figure 5). This surface presents the lowest island dispersion and is more similar to Fe overlayers epitaxially grown on Pt(111). (34) Under the growth conditions of 1.3 × 108, 1.3 × 107, and 1.3 × 106 mbar O2, the prepared FeO/Pt(111) surfaces (Figure 5bd) have an island density of 0.91 × 1012/cm2, 2.39 × 1012/cm2, and 3.63 × 1012/cm2, respectively. Assuming the same homogeneous nucleation of FeO on Pt(111) under these oxidant conditions, the activation energy for Fe and O species diffusion on Pt(111) under 1.3 × 108 and 1.3 × 106 mbar O2 is calculated as 7.05 and 10.16 kJ/mol, respectively, based on eq 2 and the derived activation energy for Fe and O species diffusion under 1.3 × 107 mbar O2. The dependence of the diffusion activation energy on O2 partial pressure is illustrated in Figure 6. As we can see, the surface diffusion barrier increases with an increase in the O2 partial pressure. Probably, the higher surface oxygen coverage under higher O2 partial pressures limits surface diffusion and causes FeO to nucleate into highly dispersed small nanoislands.

Third, the postannealing exerts strong effects on the morphology and structure of the formed FeO nanoislands. A 0.25 ML FeO/Pt(111) sample was prepared by evaporation of Fe at 200 K under 1.3 × 107 mbar O2, and then the surface was annealed at various temperatures in UHV. STM was applied to study the evolution of the surface structure and morphology with the annealing temperature (Figure 7). The as-prepared FeO/Pt(111) surface warmed to RT has wormlike FeO nanoislands (Figure 7a). After annealing at 473 K, the FeO nanoislands become more regular and well-ordered, and at the same time, island coalescence occurs (Figure 7b). On the FeO nanoislands, periodic bright dots are clearly visible, which are similar to those shown in Figure 2b. As illustrated later, these FeO nanoislands are atomically flat, and the bright dots are due to Moir patterns of monolayer FeO on Pt(111). (14) Upon annealing at 573 and 673 K, a much stronger island coalescence happens and most of islands present the shape of a triangle or truncated triangle. Moreover, Moir patterns on the FeO surfaces are more regularly arranged (Figure 7c,d). XPS Fe 2p spectra recorded from the 0.25 ML FeO/Pt(111) annealed below 673 K show that Fe 2p3/2 BEs keep constant at 709.3 eV (Figure 8). However, the main peak of Fe 2p3/2 shifts down to 708.9 eV in the case of annealing at 773 K, which suggests that the FeO nanoislands begin to decompose above 673 K. Figure 7e clearly shows that the morphology of FeO nanoislands starts to change upon annealing at 773 K and most of islands contain two regions with different contrasts. The high-resolution STM image (Figure 7f) indicates that the typical Moir patterns disappear in the newly formed regions, which should be due to reduction of the FeO islands. Moreover, the reduced region has the same step height as the Pt(111) substrate. We suggest that the reduced Fe could diffuse into the subsurface region, leaving the so-called Pt-skin surface layer. (15) The present result demonstrates that FeO nanoislands have a much lower thermal stability than FeO monolayer films that were reported to be stable above 1000 K. (35)

Finally, the density and size of FeO nanoislands also critically depend on FeO coverage. Figure 9a shows the morphology of 0.06 ML FeO overlayers grown at 150 K in 1.3 × 106 mbar O2 and annealed at 473 K in UHV. The FeO nanoislands are evenly distributed on Pt(111), and most islands have the size of 5 nm and the shape of a triangle. For 0.25 ML FeO/Pt(111), the FeO nanoislands are also highly dispersed but the island size increases up to around 10 nm (Figure 9b). When the coverage reaches to 0.5 ML, many islands coalesce with each other to form islands as large as 30 nm (Figure 9c). An almost continuous FeO film forms with some uncovered holes and defects in the case of 0.8 ML FeO (Figure 9d).
Figure 9
Figure 9. STM images of FeO overlayers with different coverages grown on Pt(111) at LT (150170 K) in an O2 atmosphere (1.3 × 1071.3 × 106 mbar) and subsequently annealed between 473 and 573 K in UHV: (a) 0.06, (b) 0.25, (c) 0.5, and (d) 0.80 ML. All of the images are in the size of 100 nm × 100 nm and recorded under (a) 0.79 V, 0.04 nA; (b) 2.0 V, 0.025 nA; (c) 2.0 V, 0.019 nA; and (d) 2.0 V, 0.025 nA.
The peripheries of the FeO nanoislands as prepared on Pt(111) contain coordinatively unsaturated ferrous (CUF) sites, which have been proved to play very critical roles in CO oxidation reactions. (1) The specific periphery density (SPD), defined as the length of the periphery of FeO nanoislands per unit area of the Pt(111) substrate, is used to quantify the dispersion. The periphery length of FeO nanoislands was obtained using WSxM software, (36) as shown in Figure 10a. The SPD value shown here is the average of several STM images of a FeO/Pt(111) sample grown at one specific condition. Figure 10bd shows the effect of the growth temperature, the O2 partial pressure, and the annealing temperature on the SPD of FeO nanoislands with a given FeO coverage of 0.25 ML. The periphery density has been greatly increased when decreasing the growth temperature or increasing the O2 partial pressure because of the decreased diffusion coefficient of Fe and O species on Pt(111) under these conditions, as stated above. Furthermore, increasing the annealing temperature results in aggregation of the FeO nanoislands, which decreases the SPD.

On the basis of the above experimental results, we conclude that well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands can be prepared on Pt(111) by depositing 0.25 ML Fe at the substrate temperature of 150250 K and in the O2 partial pressure range from 1.3 × 108 to 1.3 × 106 mbar, followed by postannealing between 473 and 673 K in UHV. The low growth temperature and presence of an oxidant atmosphere are critical to the structure and morphology of the FeO overlayers. The size of FeO nanoislands can be effectively controlled by the postannealing and FeO coverage.
3.2 Characterization of the FeO Nanoislands
A typical 0.25 ML FeO/Pt(111) surface was prepared via deposition of Fe at 150 K in 1.3 × 106 mbar O2, followed by UHV annealing at 473 K. The atomic structure of the FeO nanoislands was characterized by STM. It was found that the FeO surfaces exhibit an apparently strong bias-dependent topography. For both positive and negative high-bias voltages, STM images of the FeO nanoislands show typical periodic bright dots (Figure 11a,b). Under low-bias voltage conditions, the surface structure of FeO nanoislands can be atomically resolved by STM. The high-resolution STM images reveal that all of the FeO nanoislands are indeed atomically flat with a thickness of a monolayer (Figure 11c). In large islands, domain boundary can be observed and the individual domains have a regular shape, for example, a triangle. Figure 11df further displays STM images from one FeO nanoisland recorded at various bias voltages, which again demonstrates atomic resolution at low bias voltages of +0.3 and 0.3 V but bright dots at a bias voltage of +1.5 V.
Figure 11

Bias-dependent atomic resolution STM images from a single FeO island on Pt(111): (d) 0.3 V, 0.05 nA, 10 nm × 10 nm; (e) 0.3 V, 0.2 nA, 10 nm × 10 nm; (f) 1.5 V, 0.2 nA, 10 nm × 10 nm.
To determine the lattice constant of the FeO nanoislands, an attempt was made to record atomic resolution images from the FeO nanoislands and the bare Pt(111) surface simultaneously. It is known that oxygen adsorbed on Pt(111) forms (2 × 2)-O islands, which can be more easily resolved by STM. (37, 38) The 0.25 ML FeO/Pt(111) surface was exposed to 35 L O2 at RT and cooled to 77 K for STM investigations. As shown in Figure 12, the atomic structure of (2 × 2)-O islands can be clearly discerned, which was used to calibrate the atomic periodicity of the FeO nanoislands that appeared in the same image. Accordingly, the atomic periodicity of the FeO nanoislands was determined to be 3.10 Å, which is similar to that of monolayer FeO films on Pt(111) (3.11 Å). (14) The surface atoms and the Moir patterns of individual FeO nanoislands were also resolved by LT-STM at 77 K (Figure 13). On the island surfaces, the surface atom rows are not linearly, but zigzag arranged, which may be caused by the relaxation of surface atoms due to the high surface lattice mismatch. Because the lattice constant of the FeO nanoislands was measured to be 3.10 Å (as shown in Figure 12), the coincidence growth of FeO(111) on Pt(111) should lead to superimposition of (8 × 8) FeO(111) (24.8 Å) on (9 × 9) Pt(111) (24.9 Å). Accordingly, a schematic structure model of FeO(111) on Pt(111) could be given in Figure 13d, which is similar to that of FeO(111) film grown on Pt(111). (14) Moreover, atomic defects at the island edges can be distinguished in the STM images (Figure 13a,b). Interestingly, the defects have the same periodicity of nine atoms as the Moir patterns.

(d) Structural models of FeO nanoislands on Pt(111), showing the formation of a Moir pattern due to the coincidence growth of FeO on Pt(111).
To better understand the atomic structure of the edges of the FeO nanoislands, STM experiments were further performed at the liquid He temperature (5 K). The LT-STM images (Figure 14a) reveal that defect sites at the island edges are indeed not due to missing atoms but show themselves with lower contrast. The other sites at the edges look brighter and larger than the other surface atoms (Figures 13 and 14a), which may be induced by the edge electronic state. Additionally, a circle of less bright dots was found to surround the nanoisland in the 5 K STM image (Figure 14a), and this structure could not be resolved in the RT and LN2 STM images (Figures 1113). Because the FeO nanoislands were grown in an O2 atmosphere, edges of the FeO nanoislands should be terminated with O atoms as long as adsorbed oxygen species on the FeO/Pt(111) surfaces have not been specially removed, for example, by exposure to CO. (1) At the liquid He temperature, the adsorbed O atoms at the edge sites could be frozen and, thus, become visible in STM. The dI/dV spectra were acquired from the bare Pt(111), inside of a FeO nanoisland, and the island edge at 5 K (Figure 14b). The island edge presents a distinct electronic state at 0.65 eV, which can be observed at different edge sites around the FeO nanoislands. Giordano et al. have calculated that the Fe dz2 local density of states (LDOS) of the FeO/Pt(111) surface has a strong peak between 0.4 and 1.0 eV. (39) Accordingly, we suggest that the electronic state at 0.65 eV may be related to the orbital of edge Fe atoms. However, the nature of this interface state needs further theoretical study. The state on the FeO nanoislands (1.70 eV) is due to the overlay between Pt and Fe dz2 orbitals. (39)

HREELS is sensitive to surface-adsorbed species and chemical bonding and was applied here to study the surface characteristics of the FeO nanoislands. (4, 19) FeO monolayer films grown on Pt(111) have been well studied in the past decade. The film consists of a bilayer of Fe and O atoms with the Fe layer at the interface and the O layer on the top surface. (12, 14, 39) For comparison, the FeO film on Pt(111) was prepared as the reference surface, which was obtained via oxidation of 1 ML FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) at 900 K in 1.3 × 106 mbar O2. Figure 15 shows HREELS spectra from the 0.25 ML FeO nanoislands and the 1 ML FeO film on Pt(111). On the FeO film surface, there is only one surface phonon peak at 53 meV. For the FeO nanoislands, the main phonon peak is centered at 55.5 meV with a shoulder peak at 47.5 meV. This new shoulder peak may originate from the less coordinated Fe cations at the edges of the FeO nanoislands. The similar weak shoulder peaks at a lower loss energy were also reported in the HREELS spectra of NiO films grown on Ni(100), Ni(111), and Pd(100), which have been attributed to the low-coordinated Ni atoms at the NiOmetal boundaries. (40-42) The STM image of FeO nanoislands at 5 K (Figure 14) shows different O species at the FeO island perimeters, which further support the explanation of the HREELS peak at 47.5 meV. The surface phonon vibration on the FeO nanoislands presents a little higher vibration frequency than that on the monolayer FeO film. Such a difference may cause different surface reactivities. The lower thermal stability of the FeO nanoislands than the FeO monolayer film, as mentioned above, is just one example.

There are three different stacking domains within the Moir pattern, which may have different physical and chemical properties. Giordano et al. found that Au atoms prefer to adsorb on the hcp domains because this position presents the largest surface dipole. (43) Merte et al. later showed that it is the fcc domain that has the largest surface dipole by chemically modifying the FeO/Pt(111) surface through hydrogen reduction. The preferred adsorption sites for Au atoms should be fcc domains. (44) It has been shown that the assignment of the domains on the FeO surface is very sensitive to surface structure models. The FeO nanoislands on Pt(111) prepared in this work have many edge sites. It will be very helpful to assign the surface domains in view of the thermal stability of the different domains.
Figure 16a shows an STM image of the 0.25 ML FeO/Pt(111) surface recorded at 2.0 V. It is well accepted that the top domains become dominant when the imaging potential increases above 1.5 V. (39, 45) Therefore, the brightest dots in the high-bias STM images were attributed to the top domains, labeled with circles (Figure 16b). From Figure 16a, we see that the FeO top domains are the first ones that are not fully developed at the edge and corner sites of the islands during growth. For the islands 38 in Figure 16a, the top domains at some of the vertices of the triangle islands even become missing. The result indicates that the top domain should present the lowest thermodynamic stability such that the population of this domain in the nanoislands is minimized. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation has shown that the energies of the top and hcp domains, in eV per FeO unit, are 0.219 and 0.170 eV relative to the fcc domain. (44) Our experimental result is consistent with the calculated stability data.

STM images of FeO nanoislands taken at different bias voltages: (a) 2.0 V, 0.028 nA, 100 nm × 100 nm; (b) 2.0 V, 0.028 nA, 18 nm × 18 nm; (c) 0.02 V, 3 nA, 10 nm × 12 nm; (d) 0.05 V, 2.5 nA, 7.0 nm × 8.5 nm. The Fe-top, Fe-fcc, and Fe-hcp domains are indicated with a circle (), square (), and triangle (), respectively.
The other two domains with less brightness are hcp and fcc, and it is still controversial to assign them in the literature. (39, 43-47) The smallest island in Figure 16a, labeled with 1, has a dark region in the center surrounded with three bright dots at the vertices, that is, the three top domains. Considering that the fcc domain has the lowest energy, (44) we attribute the central dark region to the fcc domain, which prefers to be present inside of the nanoislands. This preference occupation can also be seen in island 2 (Figure 16a), in which there are three fcc domains and three hcp domains besides one top domain in the center shown as the brightest dot. According to the thermal stability, the fcc domain prefers to be present inside of the nanoislands, so the nearest three domains around the top domain in the center of the island 2 are assigned to fcc domains. The domains close to the corners of the triangle island are assigned to hcp, which have the second less stability. (44) On the basis of these discussions, the top, hcp, and fcc domains can be assigned, which are marked by a circle, triangle, and square, respectively (Figure 16bd). Their brightness increases in the order of top > hcp > fcc at the bias voltage of 2.0 V.
Figure 16c,d shows STM images of two FeO nanoislands recorded at low bias voltages (2050 mV). The island in Figure 16c has the same geometry as the islands 28 in Figure 16a. According to the assignment for the above high-bias STM images, the well-resolved domain in the center of the triangle-shaped FeO nanoisland should be the top domain, and the adjacent three domains inside of the island and with highest brightness are fcc domains. The hcp domains are close to the edges. On the basis of our assignment, the brightness of the domains in the low-bias STM images increases in the order of fcc > hcp, which is consistent with Giordanos results (39) but contrary to the recent DFT calculations. (47)
The characterization results of the FeO nanoislands suggest that, in the case of submonolayer coverage, FeO nanoislands always have a monolayer thickness (actually a bilayer of Fe and O atoms) with one layer of Fe atoms at the interface and one layer of O atoms at the top surface (Figures 1113). To illustrate further the critical role of the FeOsupport interaction in the formation of the metastable FeO surface phase, iron oxides were grown on a highly orientated pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface using the same process as the growth of the FeO nanoislands on Pt(111). The Fe 2p3/2 BE of the FeO1+x/HOPG surface has a +2.0 eV shift in comparison with that of the FeO/Pt(111) surface. 3D FeO1+x (x  0.5) nanoparticles were obtained on the HOPG surface, as confirmed by the STM and XPS results (Figure 17). Obviously, the weak interaction between Fe and HOPG could not stabilize the metastable 2D FeO phase. Monolayer FeO overlayers have been grown on Pt(111), (2) Ru(0001), (31) and Au(111), (24) and we believe that the strong interaction of Fe with these metal supports contributes to the growth of the metastable FeO surface phase. The existence of transition metal thin films is attributable to the extra stability that arises from its adhesion energy at the underlying oxide-metal interface. (48) We have studied the interfacial interaction between the FeO overlayer and the Pt(111) substrate using DFT calculations, and the calculated interfacial adhesion energy is 1.40 eV per FeO formula. (1) Thus, the interface confinement effect, which originates from the strong interaction between the FeO overlayer and the Pt(111) substrate, stabilizes the FeO nanoislands. The existence of a strong interface interaction is also consistent with previously published theoretical calculation results, which report that there is an electron transfer of 0.20.3 e from the FeO film toward the Pt(111) surface. (39)

Finally, it should be noted that, in comparison to the full FeO monolayer films, the main structural characteristic of the FeO nanoislands is the presence of high-density metaloxide boundaries or island edge sites. As shown by the high-resolution STM images and the STS results (Figure 14), the island edges show a distinct atomic structure and electronic property, which may provide active sites for catalytic reactions, for example, CO oxidation reactions.

4 Conclusions
A two-step deposition process, which consists of evaporation of Fe in an oxidant atmosphere at low temperatures and subsequent annealing in UHV at elevated temperatures, was applied to grow FeO nanostructures on Pt(111). Well-defined and highly dispersed FeO nanoislands have been obtained by depositing 0.25 ML Fe at the Pt(111) substrate temperature of 150250 K and in the O2 partial pressure range from 1.3 × 108 to 1.3 × 106 mbar, followed by postannealing between 473 and 673 K in UHV. It has been shown that the low deposition temperatures and higher oxidant atmospheres are critical to the structure and morphology of the FeO nanoislands, which facilitate the feasible oxidation of deposited Fe and the high dispersion of the formed FeO nanoislands.
The well-defined FeO nanoislands exhibit a Moir pattern with a periodicity of 2.48 nm. The brightness order of the three stacking domains within one Moir pattern is top > hcp > fcc at high imaging potentials (>1.5 V). The top domains are the first ones that are not fully developed at the FeO island boundaries, whereas the fcc and hcp domains are populated inside of the islands, indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the domains increases in the order of fcc > hcp > top. At the FeOPt interfaces, there exist a distinct atomic structure and electronic states in comparison to the sites inside the islands. The formation of a metastable 2D FeO surface phase is attributed to the interface confinement effect, which originates from the strong interaction between FeO and the Pt substrate. The 2D interface confinement at metal surfaces results in the formation of various metastable oxide surface phases on metal substrates.
