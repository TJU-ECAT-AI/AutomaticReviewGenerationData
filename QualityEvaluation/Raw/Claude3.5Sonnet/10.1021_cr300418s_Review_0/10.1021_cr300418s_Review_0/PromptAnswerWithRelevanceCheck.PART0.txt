Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide. This disruption is intended to favorably alter the catalytic activity of the oxide. The active centers created by this doping process can be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. 

The main goal of this approach is to place oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations, which is expected to improve their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions. This modification of the surface chemistry has implications for enhancing catalytic activity in industrially relevant reactions, particularly oxidation processes.

Computational work has been conducted to understand the properties of doped oxides and provide a classification of dopant-oxide pairs based on common properties. These calculations aim to identify trends and rules for catalyst design, potentially increasing the probability of finding better oxide catalysts for industrial applications.

However, it's important to note that the performance of doped oxide catalysts depends strongly on the method of preparation, and it can be challenging to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been successfully prepared. This highlights the need for careful consideration of preparation methods and characterization techniques when developing and studying these catalysts.

金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂通过破坏主体氧化物表面的化学键来修改表面化学性质。这种破坏旨在有利地改变氧化物的催化活性。由这种掺杂过程产生的活性中心可以是靠近掺杂剂的氧原子，也可以是掺杂剂本身。

这种方法的主要目标是将氧原子置于不寻常的键合情况下，这有望提高它们催化氧化反应的能力。这种表面化学性质的修改对于提高工业相关反应（特别是氧化过程）的催化活性具有重要意义。

已经进行了计算工作来理解掺杂氧化物的性质，并基于共同特性提供了掺杂剂-氧化物对的分类。这些计算旨在识别催化剂设计的趋势和规则，可能增加找到更好的工业应用氧化物催化剂的概率。

然而，值得注意的是，掺杂氧化物催化剂的性能强烈依赖于制备方法，并且很难提供令人信服的证据证明已成功制备了掺杂氧化物。这突显了在开发和研究这些催化剂时需要仔细考虑制备方法和表征技术的重要性。

The active centers created by this doping process can be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. 

The goal of this substitution is to place oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations, which is expected to improve their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions. This approach has potential implications for enhancing catalytic activity in industrially relevant reactions.

Examples of reactions where this technique has been applied include the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene using oxygen or CO2 as oxidants, and the ODH of ethane with oxygen. These examples suggest that substitutional cation doping can potentially improve the performance of metal oxide catalysts in important industrial processes.
