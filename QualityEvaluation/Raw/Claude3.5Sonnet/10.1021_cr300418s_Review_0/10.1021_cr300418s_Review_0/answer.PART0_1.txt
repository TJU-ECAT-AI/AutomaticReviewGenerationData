Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide. This disruption is intended to favorably modify the catalytic activity of the oxide. The active centers created by this process can be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. 

The goal of this doping is to place oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations, which is expected to improve their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions. This approach has implications for potentially enhancing catalytic activity in industrially relevant reactions.

Computational work has been conducted to study the properties of doped oxides, providing a classification of dopant-oxide pairs based on common properties. These calculations aim to identify trends and rules for catalyst design, potentially increasing the probability of finding better oxide catalysts for various applications.

However, it's important to note that the performance of doped oxide catalysts depends strongly on the method of preparation, and it can be challenging to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been successfully prepared. Additionally, there are limitations in computational methods and a lack of detailed knowledge about the atomic-level morphology and composition of oxide catalysts under working conditions, which affects the ability to fully predict and optimize their catalytic properties.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行阳离子替代掺杂会通过破坏宿主氧化物表面的化学键来改变表面化学性质。这种破坏旨在有利地改变氧化物的催化活性。通过这一过程产生的活性中心可以是掺杂剂附近的氧原子，也可以是掺杂剂本身。

这种掺杂的目标是将氧原子置于不寻常的键合情况下，预期这将提高它们催化氧化反应的能力。这种方法对于潜在地提高工业相关反应的催化活性具有重要意义。

已经进行了计算工作来研究掺杂氧化物的性质，提供了基于共同特性的掺杂剂-氧化物对的分类。这些计算旨在识别催化剂设计的趋势和规则，可能增加找到更好的氧化物催化剂的概率，以应用于各种场合。

然而，需要注意的是，掺杂氧化物催化剂的性能强烈依赖于制备方法，而且很难提供令人信服的证据证明已成功制备了掺杂氧化物。此外，计算方法存在固有的局限性，且缺乏对工作条件下氧化物催化剂原子级形态和组成的详细了解，这影响了完全预测和优化其催化性能的能力。
