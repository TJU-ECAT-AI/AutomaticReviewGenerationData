Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide. This disruption is intended to favorably modify the catalytic activity of the oxide. The active centers created by this doping process can be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. 

The goal of this substitution is to place oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations, which is expected to improve their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions. This approach has potential implications for enhancing catalytic activity in industrially relevant reactions.

Examples of reactions where this technique has been applied include the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene using oxygen or CO2 as oxidants, and the ODH of ethane with oxygen. These examples suggest that substitutional cation doping can potentially improve the performance of metal oxide catalysts in important industrial processes.

However, it's important to note that this field is still emerging and evolving rapidly. The effectiveness of this approach depends strongly on the method of preparation, and it can be challenging to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been successfully prepared. Therefore, while substitutional cation doping shows promise for enhancing catalytic activity, more research is needed to fully understand and optimize its effects.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行替代性阳离子掺杂会通过破坏主体氧化物表面的化学键来修改表面化学性质。这种破坏旨在有利地改变氧化物的催化活性。由这种掺杂过程创造的活性中心可以是掺杂剂附近的氧原子，也可以是掺杂剂本身。

这种替代的目标是将氧原子置于不寻常的成键情况下，这有望提高它们催化氧化反应的能力。这种方法对提高工业相关反应的催化活性有潜在影响。

应用这种技术的反应例子包括使用氧气或CO2作为氧化剂的乙苯氧化脱氢(ODH)制苯乙烯，以及使用氧气的乙烷ODH。这些例子表明，替代性阳离子掺杂可能会提高金属氧化物催化剂在重要工业过程中的性能。

然而，需要注意的是，这个领域仍在快速发展和演变中。这种方法的有效性强烈依赖于制备方法，并且要提供令人信服的证据证明成功制备了掺杂氧化物是具有挑战性的。因此，虽然替代性阳离子掺杂在提高催化活性方面显示出前景，但还需要更多研究来充分理解和优化其效果。
