Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by disrupting chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide. This disruption is intended to favorably modify the catalytic activity of the oxide. The active centers created by this doping process could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself. By placing oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations, the goal is to improve their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions. This approach has implications for potentially enhancing catalytic activity in industrially relevant reactions, particularly in oxidation catalysis. However, the review notes that this is an emerging field, and the effectiveness of this strategy for improving catalytic performance is still being explored and evaluated.

在金属氧化物催化剂中，取代型阳离子掺杂通过扰乱宿主氧化物表面的化学键来修改表面化学性质。这种扰动旨在有利地改变氧化物的催化活性。由这种掺杂过程创造的活性中心可能是靠近掺杂剂的氧原子，也可能是掺杂剂本身。通过将氧原子置于不寻常的成键情况下，目标是提高它们催化氧化反应的能力。这种方法对潜在提高工业相关反应的催化活性有影响，特别是在氧化催化方面。然而，该综述指出，这是一个新兴领域，这种策略在改善催化性能方面的有效性仍在探索和评估中。
