Catalysis by Doped Oxides

SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the 2013 Surface Chemistry of Oxides special issue.
1 Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Metal oxide catalysts have numerous industrial applications. (1-7) In addition, oxides catalyze many important reactions whose conversion or selectivity is too low to be commercially interesting. We review here experiments and calculations whose goal was to improve the catalytic activity of an oxide by substituting a small fraction of the cations of a “host oxide” with a different cation. We call this substitutional doping or doping. The substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide, and optimists hope that this will modify favorably its catalytic activity. The active centers in such a system could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself.
This is not the only kind of “creative disturbance” that can activate the surface of an oxide. The catalytic activity of a small (molecular size) cluster MeOx (where Me is a cation, O is oxygen, and x is usually unknown) supported on the surface of another oxide (or any other insulator) is often very different from that of the bulk oxide of Me. For example, VOx clusters supported on ceria (8, 9) are more active for methanol oxidation (and many other reactions) than either V2O5 or CeO2. The so-called “inverse catalysts” are similar. They consist of a very thin oxide film supported on a metal surface. (10-30) In this system, as in the other two mentioned above, we place the oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations with the intention of improving their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions.
Substitutional cation doping is not the only possibility. One can imagine that replacing some anions with other anions may also be beneficial. There is evidence that the presence of small amounts of halogen in the feed or on the oxide surface improves its catalytic activity (more often the selectivity). (31-53) We do not know of any work that has proven that the improvements come from the substitution of some of the oxygen atoms with halogens. Anion doping is beneficial for changing the optical properties of photocatalysts as reviewed recently by Kudo. (54)
In this Review, we discuss only oxidation catalysis by substitutional cation doping of binary oxides (oxides with the formula MexOy), and leave out complex oxides (e.g., perovskites, vanadates). This is an emerging field, which is rapidly evolving and is very far from maturity; therefore, it is not advisable to attempt the kind of exhaustive review typical of mature fields. Instead, we concentrate on the main ideas and the major difficulties of the field, try to sort out its prospects, suggest future lines of research, and examine the extent to which computations aid the search for better doped-oxide catalysts. Rather than attempt to cover all work on catalysis by doped oxides, which is rather vast and fragmentary, we examine in some depth a few examples on which data are more abundant and the research is more extensive and more systematic. One example deals with the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene, by using oxygen or CO2 as oxidant. The other example examines the ODH of ethane with oxygen. We decided that piling up more examples would not bring more clarity to our understanding of the subject. This decision was made easier by our awareness of the finite nature of our time, energy, and intellectual resources.
We note that we present scientific research rather than focus on efforts directed toward finding the best commercial catalyst. This means that some aspects that are essential for deciding whether a catalyst is commercially promising are not addressed in this article. An excellent discussion of the criteria that a commercial catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation must meet can be found in Chapter 5 of the book by Centi, Cavani, and Trifiro. (7)
As we worked on this article, several themes became central. On the experimental side two facts imposed themselves on us: The performance depends strongly on the method of preparation; and it is difficult to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared. For this reason, we devoted a section to the methods of preparation and one to the methods of characterization.
There has been considerable computational work on various properties of doped oxides. There are inherent limitations in this work. First, we know that the computational methods usable in practice do not give accurate total energies. Second, we do not know, at the atomic level, the morphology or the composition of an oxide catalyst under working conditions. The latter is a shortcoming of the experiments. We could perform useful calculations on any morphology or any surface composition, if we knew what they are. Unfortunately, experiments are not likely to provide this information soon, despite the great progress made lately in operando microscopy and spectroscopy. For these reasons, we believe that computations are most useful, at this time, if they look for qualitative trends and qualitative rules for catalyst design. They should help increase the probability of finding better oxide catalysts. This opinion has guided the way we examined the computations and organized the presentation of their results. The calculations performed so far provide a classification of the dopant&ndash;oxide pairs based on the common properties obtained by computations. One of the questions we ask in this Review is: Are there hints in the experiments that these rules are obeyed? Given the uncertainties in the experiments, we can only say that many experimental results are in accord with the qualitative suggestions made by computations.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in various industrially relevant reactions. This review section will analyze the mechanisms, surface chemistry modifications, and implications for active centers in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Mechanisms of Surface Chemistry Modification:

1. Alteration of Lewis acid-base properties: Doping with lower valence cations (e.g., La3+ in CeO2) creates electron deficiency, turning the surface into a stronger Lewis acid. Conversely, higher valence dopants (e.g., Ta5+ in CeO2) create electron excess, making the surface a stronger Lewis base [10.1021/jp211693v].

2. Charge transfer and electron trapping: Dopants like Mo act as electron donors, providing excess charges that can be transferred to adsorbed metal particles, while dopants like Li create electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow [10.1021/ja211396].

3. Formation of amorphous metal oxide phases: Doping often creates amorphous metal oxide phases at the surface, which serve as catalytic active sites [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.019].

4. Modification of oxygen vacancy formation energy: Low-valence dopants lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, potentially enhancing the catalyst's redox properties [10.1021/jp301341].

Surface Chemistry Modifications:

1. Changes in adsorbate binding: Doping affects the strength and location of adsorbate binding. For example, on La-doped CeO2, halogens preferentially bind to oxygen sites as Lewis bases, while on Ta-doped CeO2, they bind to metal sites as Lewis acids [10.1021/jp211693v].

2. Alteration of electronic properties: Less electronegative support cations increase electron density on bridging bonds, enhancing redox activity [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.019].

3. Modification of particle morphology: Doping can control metal particle growth, tailoring between 2D and 3D forms, which affects catalytic activity [10.1021/ja211396].

4. Tuning of surface acidity/basicity: Doping can neutralize or enhance surface acidity or basicity, affecting the catalyst's ability to activate certain chemical bonds [10.1016/j.cej.2007.05.038].

Implications for Active Centers:

1. Creation of new active sites: Doping introduces new types of active centers, often near the dopant sites, with different electronic properties than the undoped surface [10.1021/cr300418s\_0].

2. Modification of existing active sites: Doping can alter the nature and reactivity of existing active sites, potentially enhancing their catalytic activity [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.019].

3. Shift in active site location: The nature and location of active sites often shift from bulk to surface amorphous phases upon doping [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.019].

4. Enhanced metal-support interactions: Doping can lead to improved adhesion between metal particles and the oxide support, potentially creating more stable and active catalysts [10.1021/ja211396].

Catalytic Activity Enhancement:

1. Lowered activation barriers: Doping can significantly reduce reaction energy barriers, as demonstrated by the dramatic reduction in methane dissociation energy on La-doped CeO2 [10.1021/jp211693v].

2. Improved selectivity: Strategic doping can enhance selectivity for desired products, as seen in the increased C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity in oxidative coupling of methane reactions [10.1016/j.cej.2007.05.038].

3. Enhanced stability: Appropriate dopant selection can improve catalyst stability by retarding sintering processes [10.1016/j.cattod.2004.12.019].

Potential Improvements in Industrially Relevant Reactions:

1. Propane dehydrogenation: While not directly addressed in the provided literature, the principles of substitutional cation doping could potentially enhance propane dehydrogenation catalysts by:
   a. Facilitating C-H bond activation through modified surface acidity/basicity.
   b. Improving selectivity to propylene by tuning the strength of propane and propylene adsorption.
   c. Enhancing catalyst stability by modifying surface properties to resist coking and sintering.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation: The literature suggests that doping can improve performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, such as ethylbenzene to styrene and ethane to ethylene [10.1021/cr300418s\_0].

3. Methane activation: Doped catalysts show promise in enhancing methane conversion and C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity, which could be extended to other alkane activation processes [10.1039/c39860000586].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The field of substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts offers promising avenues for enhancing catalytic performance in various industrially relevant reactions, including propane dehydrogenation. The ability to fine-tune surface properties, create new active sites, and modify existing ones provides a powerful toolbox for catalyst design.

Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing more precise doping techniques to achieve better control over dopant distribution and concentration.
2. Exploring multi-element doping strategies to create synergistic effects and further optimize catalyst performance.
3. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the nature and behavior of active sites in doped catalysts.
4. Applying machine learning and high-throughput screening methods to accelerate the discovery of optimal dopant-catalyst combinations for specific reactions.
5. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of doped catalysts under industrial conditions.
6. Exploring the potential of doped catalysts in emerging fields such as electrocatalysis and photocatalysis for energy conversion and storage applications.

By addressing these challenges and opportunities, researchers can unlock the full potential of substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, leading to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes across various industries.
