          [1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "The most probable cause of the modifying action of chloride ions is the poisoning of the catalyst surface by them and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. In consequence, there decreases the rate of all the stages of the process taking place with its participation, i.e., the activation of methane, which is manifested as a decrease in the degree of the conversion and successive transformations of hydrocarbons leading up to their complete oxidation."

[4] "It was also noted that chloride ions neutralize the strong basicity of the surface of catalysts Li/MgO [25,27], Na/CaO [21], BaCl2/CaO [14] or Na/MnMgO [19]. In catalyst Li/MgO, small amounts of chloride ions are preferentially sited at low coordinate sites [51] and an analogous localization of chloride ions may be expected in catalyst Na/CaO."

[5] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[6] "It seems that at high temperatures of the reaction, the surface concentration of the active form of oxygen is still sufficiently high to enable the possibility of intensive secondary transformations of ethane to ethylene and, on subsequent stages, to hydrocarbons C3+."

[7] "There is an optimum contents of chloride ions in the catalyst, about 2 wt.%, at which the increase in the selectivity of the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons is the largest in comparison with the value obtained with the chloride-free catalyst."

          Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in metal oxide catalysts like Na/CaO modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Surface poisoning: Chloride ions poison the catalyst surface, reducing the number of active oxygen sites. This primarily excludes the most active sites from methane transformations.

2. Basicity neutralization: Chloride ions neutralize the strong basicity of the catalyst surface.

3. Selective site poisoning: It affects both highly active and less active oxygen-containing sites, changing the nature and distribution of active centers.

4. Preferential localization: Small amounts of chloride ions preferentially locate at low coordination sites on the surface.

These surface modifications have several implications for catalytic activity enhancement and the nature of active centers:

1. Decreased overall activity: Generally, it reduces catalytic activity and methane conversion, especially at lower temperatures.

2. Improved selectivity: At optimal chloride content (around 2 wt%), it enhances selectivity for C2+ hydrocarbons formation.

3. Temperature dependence: Effects are more pronounced at lower temperatures, with higher temperatures still allowing for secondary transformations.

4. Active site modification: It changes the nature and location of active centers by poisoning the most active sites and potentially creating new types of sites.

For industrially relevant reactions like oxidative coupling of methane (OCM):

1. Selectivity improvement: Enhanced selectivity for ethane and ethylene formation at optimal chloride content and higher temperatures.

2. Reaction conditions: Requires higher reaction temperatures and longer contact times to achieve improved performance.

3. Tunable performance: Allows for tailoring catalyst properties by controlling chloride ion content to optimize desired product yields and selectivities.

Overall, chloride doping provides a method to tune the reactivity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts, but requires careful optimization of dopant levels and reaction conditions to realize improvements in industrially relevant reactions.

          在Na/CaO等金属氧化物催化剂中进行氯离子取代阳离子掺杂通过以下几种方式改变表面化学性质并扰乱化学键合：

1. 表面毒化：氯离子毒化催化剂表面，减少活性氧位点的数量。这主要排除了最活跃的位点参与甲烷转化。

2. 碱性中和：氯离子中和了催化剂表面的强碱性。

3. 选择性位点毒化：它影响高活性和低活性的含氧位点，改变活性中心的性质和分布。

4. 优先定位：少量氯离子优先定位于表面的低配位位点。

这些表面改性对催化活性增强和活性中心性质有几个影响：

1. 整体活性降低：通常会降低催化活性和甲烷转化率，尤其是在较低温度下。

2. 选择性提高：在最佳氯含量（约2 wt%）下，提高C2+烃形成的选择性。

3. 温度依赖性：效果在较低温度下更为显著，较高温度仍允许二次转化。

4. 活性位点修饰：通过毒化最活跃的位点并可能创造新类型的位点，改变活性中心的性质和位置。

对于甲烷氧化偶联（OCM）等工业相关反应：

1. 选择性改进：在最佳氯含量和较高温度下，提高乙烷和乙烯形成的选择性。

2. 反应条件：需要更高的反应温度和更长的接触时间才能获得改善的性能。

3. 可调性能：通过控制氯离子含量来调整催化剂性能，以优化所需产品的产率和选择性。

总的来说，氯掺杂提供了一种调节金属氧化物催化剂反应性和选择性的方法，但需要仔细优化掺杂剂水平和反应条件，以实现工业相关反应的改进。
