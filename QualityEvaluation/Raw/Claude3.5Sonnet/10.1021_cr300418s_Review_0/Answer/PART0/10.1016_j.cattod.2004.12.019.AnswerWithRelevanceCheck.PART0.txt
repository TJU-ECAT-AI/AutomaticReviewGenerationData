          [1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxides (supported metal oxides, molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxides) has undergone dramatic paradigm changes over the past 25 years as new characterization techniques became available"

[2] "Application of these spectroscopic techniques to the investigation of mixed metal oxide catalysts have provided new fundamental insights into the electronic and molecular structures of mixed metal oxide catalytic active sites and how they control the catalytic activity and selectivity characteristics."

[3] "The most significant discovery has been that amorphous metal oxide phases are always present and are the catalytic active sites for many applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts."

[4] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[5] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

[6] "The catalytic TOF value for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermodynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant."

[7] "It was found that the thermodynamic equilibrium adsorption constant, Kads, was relatively invariant as the oxide support electronegativity was changed. The kinetic rate constant, krds, however, varied significantly as the oxide support electronegativity was changed."

[8] "The direct interaction of the basic surface KOx species with the surface VO4 species results in more stable and less reducible oxygen species"

[9] "These fundamental studies revealed that (1) the surface VO4 species supported on TiO2 possess the same redox surface chemistry in the presence and absence of secondary acidic surface metal oxide promoters, and (2) the secondary surface metal oxide additive only becomes a promoter depending on the special chemical requirements of a given catalytic reaction."

[10] "The addition of certain surface oxide species to oxide supports can dramatically retard the thermal sintering of oxide supports. Interestingly, the effective surface oxide additives tend to be those oxides that possess very high Tammann temperatures and surface oxide additives that exhibit low Tammann temperatures tend to accelerate the sintering of the oxide support"

[11] "These fundamental findings suggest that (1) the sintering process initiates at oxide surfaces, (2) less mobile surface oxide additives retard the sintering process by titrating the surface sites responsible for initiating sintering, and (3) more mobile surface oxide additives enhance the sintering process by accelerating the condensation of surface hydroxyls and/or reactions of oxide defects."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It creates amorphous metal oxide phases at the surface, which often serve as catalytic active sites.

2. It alters the electronic properties of surface species. Less electronegative support cations increase electron density on bridging bonds, enhancing redox activity.

3. It changes the kinetic rate constant (krds) of catalytic reactions, while leaving the thermodynamic adsorption constant (Kads) relatively unchanged. This suggests doping primarily affects reaction kinetics rather than adsorption thermodynamics.

4. It can stabilize or destabilize oxygen species. Basic additives like KOx make oxygen less reducible when interacting with surface species.

5. It can introduce new functionalities without necessarily changing the activity of existing sites. For instance, adding acidic promoters does not affect vanadia redox activity but provides new acid sites.

6. It can affect particle size and structure, which may slightly impact catalytic activity.

7. It can influence thermal stability by affecting sintering behavior. Less mobile dopants with high Tammann temperatures tend to retard sintering, while more mobile dopants accelerate it.

The implications for catalytic activity enhancement, nature and location of active centers, and potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions include:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity through tuning of electronic properties and oxygen lability.

2. New types of active centers can be created while preserving existing ones.

3. The nature and location of active sites shifts from bulk to surface amorphous phases.

4. Potential for improving industrially relevant reactions by rationally designing surface compositions and properties.

5. Ability to enhance activity and selectivity by optimizing electron density at active sites and incorporating promoters that facilitate desired reaction pathways.

6. Improved thermal stability and catalyst lifetime through appropriate dopant selection to retard sintering.

7. The need to focus on characterizing and understanding surface species rather than just bulk properties when developing catalysts.

Overall, substitutional doping provides a powerful tool to engineer the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of metal oxide materials at the molecular level, allowing optimization of activity, selectivity, and stability for specific reactions and operating conditions.

          金属氧化物催化剂中的取代型阳离子掺杂通过以下几种方式修改表面化学性质并影响化学键合：

1. 它在表面创建非晶态金属氧化物相，这些相通常作为催化活性位点。

2. 它改变了表面物种的电子性质。电负性较低的支撑阳离子会增加桥键上的电子密度，从而增强氧化还原活性。

3. 它改变了催化反应的动力学速率常数(krds)，同时保持热力学吸附常数(Kads)相对不变。这表明掺杂主要影响反应动力学而非吸附热力学。

4. 它可以稳定或不稳定氧物种。像KOx这样的碱性添加剂在与表面物种相互作用时会使氧更难被还原。

5. 它可以引入新的功能而不一定改变现有位点的活性。例如，添加酸性促进剂不会影响钒的氧化还原活性，但会提供新的酸性位点。

6. 它可以影响粒子尺寸和结构，这可能会略微影响催化活性。

7. 它可以通过影响烧结行为来影响热稳定性。具有高塔曼温度的低迁移性掺杂剂倾向于延缓烧结，而更高迁移性的掺杂剂则加速烧结。

对催化活性增强、活性中心的性质和位置以及工业相关反应潜在改进的影响包括：

1. 通过调节电子性质和氧的活动性来增强催化活性。

2. 可以创建新类型的活性中心，同时保留现有的活性中心。

3. 活性位点的性质和位置从体相转移到表面非晶相。

4. 通过合理设计表面组成和性质，有可能改进工业相关反应。

5. 通过优化活性位点的电子密度并引入促进所需反应途径的促进剂，可以提高活性和选择性。

6. 通过适当选择掺杂剂来延缓烧结，提高热稳定性和催化剂寿命。

7. 在开发催化剂时，需要关注表面物种的表征和理解，而不仅仅是体相性质。

总的来说，取代型掺杂提供了一个强大的工具，可以在分子水平上设计金属氧化物材料的表面化学性质和催化性能，允许针对特定反应和操作条件优化活性、选择性和稳定性。
