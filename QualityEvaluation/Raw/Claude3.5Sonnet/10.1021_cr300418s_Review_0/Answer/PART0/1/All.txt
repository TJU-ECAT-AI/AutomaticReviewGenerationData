Chemical Bonding Disruption: Chloride ions may perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as diluents, potentially disrupting the original CeO2 bonding structure.\n\n3. Catalytic Activity Enhancement: The chlorinated surface significantly enhances ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE). This improvement is attributed to the formation of new active sites and altered reaction pathways.\n\n4. Nature and Location of Active Centers: The study implies that the active centers are surface-dependent, with the chlorided surface playing a crucial role. The effects appear to be indirect rather than direct participation of chloride ions.\n\n5. Implications for Industrial Reactions: The enhanced conversion and selectivity in ODE suggest potential improvements for this industrially relevant reaction. The chlorinated surface suppresses further oxidation of products, improving overall selectivity.\n\nWhile this example involves anion (chloride) incorporation rather than substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how modifying the surface chemistry of metal oxide catalysts can significantly impact their catalytic properties and performance in industrially relevant reactions.
