[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."

          [2] "The addition of LiCl did not increase the conversion of methane, but enhanced specifically the selectivity of C2H4."

          [3] "The favourable effect observed on addition of LiCl to Sm203 is due to depression of the further oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 to CO and C02."

          [4] "Thus, LiC1-Sm203 may be a useful catalyst in the selective synthesis of C2H4 from CH4."

[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxides (supported metal oxides, molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxides) has undergone dramatic paradigm changes over the past 25 years as new characterization techniques became available"

[2] "Application of these spectroscopic techniques to the investigation of mixed metal oxide catalysts have provided new fundamental insights into the electronic and molecular structures of mixed metal oxide catalytic active sites and how they control the catalytic activity and selectivity characteristics."

[3] "The most significant discovery has been that amorphous metal oxide phases are always present and are the catalytic active sites for many applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts."

[4] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[5] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

[6] "The catalytic TOF value for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermodynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant."

[7] "It was found that the thermodynamic equilibrium adsorption constant, Kads, was relatively invariant as the oxide support electronegativity was changed. The kinetic rate constant, krds, however, varied significantly as the oxide support electronegativity was changed."

[8] "The direct interaction of the basic surface KOx species with the surface VO4 species results in more stable and less reducible oxygen species"

[9] "These fundamental studies revealed that (1) the surface VO4 species supported on TiO2 possess the same redox surface chemistry in the presence and absence of secondary acidic surface metal oxide promoters, and (2) the secondary surface metal oxide additive only becomes a promoter depending on the special chemical requirements of a given catalytic reaction."

[10] "The addition of certain surface oxide species to oxide supports can dramatically retard the thermal sintering of oxide supports. Interestingly, the effective surface oxide additives tend to be those oxides that possess very high Tammann temperatures and surface oxide additives that exhibit low Tammann temperatures tend to accelerate the sintering of the oxide support"

[11] "These fundamental findings suggest that (1) the sintering process initiates at oxide surfaces, (2) less mobile surface oxide additives retard the sintering process by titrating the surface sites responsible for initiating sintering, and (3) more mobile surface oxide additives enhance the sintering process by accelerating the condensation of surface hydroxyls and/or reactions of oxide defects."

[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[2] "It is evident from the tables that the effect of the presence of CCl4 on the conversion and selectivity is most strikingly reflected with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2. A dramatic increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is observed with these three catalysts."

[3] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CCl4, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CCl4 and form Cl atoms or radicals."

[4] "Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes."

[5] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."

[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "The most probable cause of the modifying action of chloride ions is the poisoning of the catalyst surface by them and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. In consequence, there decreases the rate of all the stages of the process taking place with its participation, i.e., the activation of methane, which is manifested as a decrease in the degree of the conversion and successive transformations of hydrocarbons leading up to their complete oxidation."

[4] "It was also noted that chloride ions neutralize the strong basicity of the surface of catalysts Li/MgO [25,27], Na/CaO [21], BaCl2/CaO [14] or Na/MnMgO [19]. In catalyst Li/MgO, small amounts of chloride ions are preferentially sited at low coordinate sites [51] and an analogous localization of chloride ions may be expected in catalyst Na/CaO."

[5] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[6] "It seems that at high temperatures of the reaction, the surface concentration of the active form of oxygen is still sufficiently high to enable the possibility of intensive secondary transformations of ethane to ethylene and, on subsequent stages, to hydrocarbons C3+."

[7] "There is an optimum contents of chloride ions in the catalyst, about 2 wt.%, at which the increase in the selectivity of the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons is the largest in comparison with the value obtained with the chloride-free catalyst."

[1] "Whereas Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the gold, Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal."

[2] "The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants are derived from different growth morphologies with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion."

[3] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge. This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."

[4] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion. In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."

[5] "Adding small amounts of Li to the Mo-doped CaO reinstalls the initial 3D growth regime. We assign this morphology crossover to charge transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."

[6] "Our work demonstrates how oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts."

"The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials."

"By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

"Oxide ultra-thin films on metals offer new opportunities for the design of supported nanoclusters with potential use in catalysis."

"The alumina film may be looked at as an ordered arrangement of holes, or a molecular sieve. Depending on the size of metal atoms, for example Pd vs. Au, the smaller Pd atom penetrates the two-dimensional silica network, while the bigger Au atom stays on top of the silica film, behavingindeedlike a molecular sieve."

"Examples in this direction have been reported for several systems, and in particular for TiO2, an oxide which contains a relatively large amount of surface oxygen vacancies."

"The best proof of a change in the electronic structure of the metal cluster, and of the occurrence of a negative charging, is CO vibrational spectroscopy."

"the reasons for the enhanced activity are not yet fully clarified. Some authors believe that this is due to the relatively large number of low-coordinated sites at the surface of a nanoparticle; some experiments point to a special role of the oxide support; in other studies it has been proposed that the reason for the enhanced activity is the oxidation state of gold;"

"There are several parameters which can be modified in a desired way, such as the type of oxide material (ionic or covalent, reducible or non-reducible, etc.), the nature of metal/oxide interface (strong or weak adhesion, lattice mismatch, position of metal Fermi level with respect to valence and conduction band of the oxide, charge transfer at the interface, etc.), or the thickness of the oxide film (from one to several ML)."

"Such systems have been extensively studied with respect to chemical reactions on them and a very close correspondence to powder catalysts was revealed."

"The challenge is to control both shape and distribution. Thin films offer an opportunity to achieve this goal."

"Netzer and co-workers have published a series of spectacular studies on vanadium-oxide thin films as a function of coverage and thickness, literally exploring the entire phase diagram."

"First attempts in this direction have been undertaken by preparing well ordered silicates on metal surfaces with the goal to eventually exchange part of the silicon atoms by aluminium atoms."

[1] "La-doped CeO2 is a Lewis acid, and on this surface a halogen atom binds to the O site, on which it is a base. The bond of the halogen atom to an O site on the surface of the doped oxide is considerably stronger than the same bond to the undoped oxide because the halogen in XO is a base and the doped oxide is a much stronger Lewis acid than the undoped one."

[2] "Ta-doped ceria surface is a Lewis base, because the pentavalent Ta replaces a tetravalent Ce atom. On this basic surface, the halogen binds to the Ce site where it is an acid, and its bond is substantially stronger than on the pure ceria."

[3] "Doping the CeO2 surface to turn it into an acid or a base can be used to influence strongly halogen dissociation."

[4] "We suggest that halogenated surfaces may break the CH bond in methane easier than does the clean oxide surface."

[5] "To create a ceria surface that is a Lewis acid, we dope it substitutionally with a La atom. This LaCeO2(111) system is created by removing a Ce atom in the top surface layer and replacing it with a La atom. Because the trivalent La atom replaces a tetravalent Ce atom, the doped oxide has a deficit of electrons; therefore, this system is inclined to gain electrons, and it is therefore a Lewis acid."

[6] "Doping Ce with Ta creates an excess of electrons in the oxide (Ta is pentavalent), and we expect TaCeO2(111) to be a strong Lewis base."

[7] "If we adsorb a H atom to form a hydroxyl, this acts as a Lewis base and forces Cl to bind to the Ce site where it is a Lewis acid. Doping the surface with La turns it into a Lewis acid, and this forces the halogen atom to bind to the oxygen site on which it is a Lewis base. Doping with Ta has the opposite effect because the presence of Ta turns the surface into a strong Lewis base, and this forces Cl to bind to a site where it is a Lewis acid."

[8] "If we preadsorb Br2 to form BrCe on the surface, the energy of the methane dissociation reaction is +0.97 eV (Table 5). As we have already mentioned, the reaction energy is reduced because H is a Lewis base and the halogen is a Lewis acid. A more dramatic reduction of the reaction energy occurs on La-doped CeO2(111), where the reaction energy is 0.01 eV (Table 5)."

[1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."

[2] "Oxides are useful catalysts, and the chemisorption of molecules on oxide surfaces has been the subject of numerous density functional calculations. In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs."

[3] "There is much work, both experimental and computational, that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."

[4] "We point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."

[5] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[7] "Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

[1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

[3] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[4] "Since the Cl/Ce ratios are reduced by factors as large as 3 after argon-ion etching for 1 min the chlorine is apparently predominantly held within the outer portion of the surface region."

[5] "In view of the relatively small values found for Cl/Ce it is tempting to suggest that at least the localized form of the chlorided surface more closely resembles CeOCl rather than CeCl3."

[1] "The substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the surface of the host oxide, and optimists hope that this will modify favorably its catalytic activity."

          [2] "The active centers in such a system could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant or the dopant itself."

          [3] "We place the oxygen atoms in unusual bonding situations with the intention of improving their ability to catalyze oxidation reactions."

          [4] "There has been considerable computational work on various properties of doped oxides."

          [5] "The calculations performed so far provide a classification of the dopantoxide pairs based on the common properties obtained by computations."

          [6] "As we worked on this article, several themes became central. On the experimental side two facts imposed themselves on us: The performance depends strongly on the method of preparation; and it is difficult to provide convincing proof that a doped oxide has been prepared."

          [7] "One example deals with the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene, by using oxygen or CO2 as oxidant. The other example examines the ODH of ethane with oxygen."

[1] "Sm203 catalysts prepared with LiOH, LiN03, and Li2C03 increased both the conversion and the C2-selectivities, resulting in a considerable increase in C2-yield (19.5-22.2%) compared with Sm203 alone."
