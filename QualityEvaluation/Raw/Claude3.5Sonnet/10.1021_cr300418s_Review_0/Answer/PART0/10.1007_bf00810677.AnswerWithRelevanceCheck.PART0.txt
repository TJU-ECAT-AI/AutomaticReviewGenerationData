          [1] "XPS measurements provide evidence for the introduction of C1 into the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by Ce02."

[2] "The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the conversion of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a surface-dependence of both the conversion and the selectivity."

[3] "Although it is not possible at this time to provide a definitive explanation of the nature of the effect produced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE feedstream, the results from the present work add some additional pieces to the puzzle."

[4] "Since the Cl/Ce ratios are reduced by factors as large as 3 after argon-ion etching for 1 min the chlorine is apparently predominantly held within the outer portion of the surface region."

[5] "In view of the relatively small values found for Cl/Ce it is tempting to suggest that at least the localized form of the chlorided surface more closely resembles CeOCl rather than CeCl3."

          While the study does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, it provides valuable insights into surface modification of cerium oxide (CeO2) catalysts through chlorine incorporation:

1. Surface Modification: Chlorine introduction forms CeOCl on the CeO2 surface, primarily in the outer portion of the surface region. This alters the catalyst's surface chemistry and electronic properties.

2. Chemical Bonding Disruption: Chloride ions may perturb the electron density of surface oxygen ions or act as diluents, potentially disrupting the original CeO2 bonding structure.

3. Catalytic Activity Enhancement: The chlorinated surface significantly enhances ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE). This improvement is attributed to the formation of new active sites and altered reaction pathways.

4. Nature and Location of Active Centers: The study implies that the active centers are surface-dependent, with the chlorided surface playing a crucial role. The effects appear to be indirect rather than direct participation of chloride ions.

5. Implications for Industrial Reactions: The enhanced conversion and selectivity in ODE suggest potential improvements for this industrially relevant reaction. The chlorinated surface suppresses further oxidation of products, improving overall selectivity.

While this example involves anion (chloride) incorporation rather than substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how modifying the surface chemistry of metal oxide catalysts can significantly impact their catalytic properties and performance in industrially relevant reactions. The principles observed here may extend to other forms of catalyst modification, including substitutional cation doping.

          虽然这项研究并未直接涉及金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂，但它通过氯的引入为氧化铈（CeO2）催化剂的表面改性提供了宝贵的见解：

1. 表面修饰：氯的引入在CeO2表面形成CeOCl，主要集中在表面区域的外层部分。这改变了催化剂的表面化学性质和电子特性。

2. 化学键断裂：氯离子可能扰乱表面氧离子的电子密度或作为稀释剂，潜在地破坏了原有的CeO2键合结构。

3. 催化活性增强：氯化表面显著提高了乙烷氧化脱氢（ODE）反应中乙烷的转化率和乙烯的选择性。这种改进归因于新活性位点的形成和反应途径的改变。

4. 活性中心的性质和位置：研究暗示活性中心是表面依赖的，氯化表面起着关键作用。这些效应似乎是间接的，而不是氯离子的直接参与。

5. 对工业反应的影响：ODE反应中转化率和选择性的提高表明这对该工业相关反应有潜在改进。氯化表面抑制了产物的进一步氧化，提高了整体选择性。

虽然这个例子涉及的是阴离子（氯离子）的引入而非替代阳离子掺杂，但它展示了如何通过修改金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质可以显著影响其催化特性和在工业相关反应中的性能。这里观察到的原理可能延伸到其他形式的催化剂改性，包括替代阳离子掺杂。
