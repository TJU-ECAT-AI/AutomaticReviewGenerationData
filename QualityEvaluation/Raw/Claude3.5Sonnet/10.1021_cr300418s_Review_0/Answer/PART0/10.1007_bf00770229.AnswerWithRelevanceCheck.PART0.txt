          [1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[2] "It is evident from the tables that the effect of the presence of CCl4 on the conversion and selectivity is most strikingly reflected with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2. A dramatic increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is observed with these three catalysts."

[3] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CCl4, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CCl4 and form Cl atoms or radicals."

[4] "Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes."

[5] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."

          While the literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, it provides insights into how surface modification through the addition of chlorine-containing compounds (specifically CCl4) can significantly alter catalytic properties. This modification process shares some similarities with the effects of substitutional doping:

1. Surface Chemistry Modification: The addition of CCl4 alters the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface, which can be compared to how substitutional doping might change surface properties.

2. Chemical Bonding Disruption: The potential incorporation of chlorine into the oxide or the formation of metal-chlorine bonds suggests a disruption in the original chemical bonding of the catalyst, similar to what might occur in substitutional doping.

3. Catalytic Activity Enhancement: A dramatic increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is observed, particularly with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2, and Mn/SiO2 catalysts, indicating enhanced catalytic activity.

4. Active Centers: The modification likely creates new active sites or alters existing ones, as evidenced by the changed catalytic performance.

5. Industrial Relevance: The findings have implications for improving industrially relevant reactions, particularly in methane conversion processes.

The effects of CCl4 addition are highly dependent on the nature of the oxide used, suggesting that the interaction between the modifying agent and the catalyst surface is complex and catalyst-specific. This complexity is likely similar to what would be observed in substitutional cation doping.

While this approach differs from traditional substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how surface modifications can significantly enhance catalytic activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis, providing a potential alternative or complementary method to improve catalyst performance.

          虽然该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂，但它提供了关于如何通过添加含氯化合物（特别是CCl4）来修改表面从而显著改变催化性能的见解。这种修饰过程与替代掺杂的效果有一些相似之处：

1. 表面化学修饰：CCl4的添加改变了氧化物表面的酸度和/或碱度，这可以类比于替代掺杂如何改变表面性质。

2. 化学键合扰动：氯可能掺入氧化物或形成金属-氯键，这表明催化剂的原始化学键合受到扰动，类似于替代掺杂中可能发生的情况。

3. 催化活性增强：观察到C2烃产率显著增加，特别是对于Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2催化剂，表明催化活性得到增强。

4. 活性中心：这种修饰可能创造了新的活性位点或改变了现有的活性位点，这从改变的催化性能中可以看出。

5. 工业相关性：这些发现对改进工业相关反应有启示，特别是在甲烷转化过程中。

CCl4添加的效果高度依赖于所使用的氧化物的性质，这表明修饰剂与催化剂表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且具有催化剂特异性。这种复杂性可能类似于在替代阳离子掺杂中观察到的情况。

虽然这种方法与传统的替代阳离子掺杂不同，但它展示了表面修饰如何能显著提高非均相催化中的催化活性和选择性，为改善催化剂性能提供了一种潜在的替代或补充方法。
