The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence and absence of tetrachloromethane (TCM) has been investigated on 
La203, Sm203, Pr6011 and CeO2 at 773 and 973 K. Although the introduction of TCM into the ethane feedstream produced no sig- 
nificant changes with La203, Sm203 and PrrOll at 773 K, the conversion of 
ethane and the selectivity 
to ethylene on CeO2 were dis- 
tinctly enhanced by the addition of the chlorinated additive. At 973 K, with all of the rare earth oxides studied the selectivities to 
CH4 increased while those to CO2 decreased, the latter particularly significantly, suggesting that the further oxidation of CO and/ 
or CH4 is suppressed by the addition of 
the chlorinated additive. XPS measurements provide evidence 
for the introduction of C1 into 
the surface of CeO2, apparently forming CeOCI which is responsible for the enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed by 
Ce02.

1. Introduction 
Earlier work from our laboratories has shown that 
the introduction of small quantities (< 1 mol%) oftetra- 
chloromethane (TCM) into the feedstream for the par- 
tial oxidation and oxidative coupling of methane 
generally has advantageous effects in increasing the con- 
version of methane and/or the selectivity to C2 hydro- 
carbons, particularly ethylene [1,2]. Concomitantly the 
selectivity to ethane is observed to decrease, although to 
a lesser extent than the increase of that of ethylene. It is 
of interest to compare the effect of TCM on ethane with 
that on methane, particularly since ethylene is believed 
to form as a secondary product from ethane in the oxida- 
tive coupling of methane [3]. The oxidative dehydro- 
genation of ethane has been compared with and without 
TCM on several catalysts in our laboratories [4-7]. With 
12-molybdophosphoric acid supported on silica the con- 
version is increased on addition of TCM to the feed- 
stream while the C2 selectivities are unaffected. In the 
oxidation of methane and of ethane on magnesium salts, 
where TCM is present, evidence for the formation of 
magnesium chloride has been found [6-10] and the

effects of the addition of TCM on the conversion of 
ethane and the selectivity to ethylene appear to be depen- 
dent on the composition of the anions. The effects of the 
introduction of HC1 on ethane conversion have also been 
studied [11]. 
In contrast to the observations of the oxidative cou- 
pling of methane on magnesium based catalysts, oxy- 
chlorides which have been found to form on rare earth 
oxides such as La203, Sm203, CeO2 and Pr6Oll, in the 
presence of TCM, apparently contribute to the enhance- 
ment of the catalytic properties of these solids, particu- 
larly with the latter oxide [12,13]. Rare earth oxides, for 
example, Sm203 and La203, have been shown to be 
highly active in the oxidative coupling of methane [12- 
15] and such oxides have been employed as catalysts in 
comparative studies of the oxidative coupling of 
methane (OCM) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of 
ethane (ODE) in the absence of TCM [16]. There are, 
however, no reports of the results of studies of the effect 
of the introduction of TCM on the latter reaction over 
rare earth oxides. 
In the present work, the effect of the addition of small 
quantities of TCM into the ODE feedstream has been 
investigated on La203, Sm203, Pr6Oll and CeO2 at 773 
and 973 K. In addition, the catalytic activity of CeO2

2. Experimental 
Rare earth oxides La203 (99.5%), Sm203 (99.5%), 
Pr6Oll (99.9%) and CeO2 (99.9%) were obtained from 
Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, and used as received. 
Cerium chloride supported on CeO2 was prepared by 
impregnation of CeO2 with an aqueous solution of 
CeC13.7H20 (Kishida, Osaka, 99%). The supported cat- 
alysts were dried in air at 373 K overnight and calcined 
for 3 h at 1048 K. After the calcination, XPS analyses 
showed that C1/Ce ratios on the surface of 5 and 10 wt% 
CeC13 
/CeO2 were 0.32 and 0.15, respectively, to be com- 
pared with 0.12 and 0.10, respectively, after argon-ion 
etching for 1 rain, suggesting that CeC13 in the 5 wt% cat- 
alyst exists predominantly in the surface region while 
that in the 10 wt catalyst has migrated into the bulk 
phase. All catalysts were pressed, crushed, and sieved to 
the particle size of 1.70-0.85 ram. BET surface areas and 
the apparent densities of the catalysts prior to use in a 
reaction are collected in table 1. The catalytic experi- 
ments were performed in a fixed-bed continuous flow 
quartz reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. Details 
of the reactor design and procedures have been described 
elsewhere [7,8,12]. The reaction conditions were selected 
to permit comparison with the results obtained earlier 
on ethane oxidation [6,7] in which similar conditions 
were employed. The reaction was monitored with an on- 
stream Shimadzu GC-8APT gas chromatograph with a 
TC detector and integrator (Shimadzu C-R6A). Two col- 
umns, one Porapak Q (6 m x 3 mm) the other Molecular 
Sieve 5A (0.5 m x 3 mm) were employed in the analyses. 
The conversions and selectivities were calculated on the 
basis of the amounts of reaction products formed as 
determined by the GC analyses [7,8]. The carbon mass 
balances were 100-4-5%. Powder X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku CN-2011, 
using monochromatized Cu Ka radiation. Patterns were 
recorded from 5 to 60 
 X-ray photoelectron spectros- 
copy (XPS, Shimadzu ESCA-1000AX) used monochro- 
matized Mg Ka radiation. The samples were mounted 
on a sample holder in air and set into the analytical

the catalysts was carried out at 2 kV for 1 min with a 
sputtering rate estimated as ca. 2 nm/min for SIO2. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of TCM on ethane oxidation on rare earth 
oxides 
Fig. 1 shows the ODE results on La203, Sm203, 
Pr6Oll and CeO2 
in the presence and absence of TCM at 
773 K, at which the contribution of the homogeneous 
oxidation of C2H6 is negligible [6]. Although the conver- 
sion of C2H6 and the selectivities to C2 hydrocarbons 
showed little or no dependence on the catalyst in the 
absence of TCM, the COx product compositions for 
La203 and Sm203 were approximately equally divided 
between CO and CO2, while with Pr6Oll and CeO2 vir- 
tually all of the CO,, was CO2. Although neither the con- 
version nor the selectivities to COx and C2+ obtained 
with La203 and Sm203 were appreciably altered on the 
introduction of TCM, the deep oxidation to CO2 was

apparently suppressed on Pr6Oll and CeO2 and with 
the latter catalyst both the conversions and the C2+ selec- 
tivities were substantially increased. 
In the oxidative coupling of methane, the conversion 
of methane and the selectivities to CO and C2H4 in the 
presence of TCM increased with increasing time-on- 
stream on Pr6Oll [12]. In contrast with the remaining 
three catalysts, CeO2, La203 and Sm203, the introduc- 
tion of TCM to the methane feedstream produced little 
or no changes. Thus the mechanism through which 
TCM participates in the ODE is apparently not identical 
to that in OCM, at least on the rare earth catalysts. 
These comparisons also emphasize the predominant 
importance of the interaction of TCM with the catalyst 
as compared with the gas phase process at 773 K. 
At 973 K, a temperature at which the homogeneous 
conversion of ethane has a significant rate [6], the intro- 
duction of TCM produces an increase in conversion on 
Pr6Oli and CeO2 but not on La203 and Sm203 and a 
small increase in selectivity to C2H4, particularly on 
CeO2, while that to CO2 decreased markedly (fig. 2). 
These results suggest that TCM functions, at least in 
part, as an inhibitor of the secondary oxidation pro- 
cesses. Since, of the four rare earth oxides examined, 
CeO2 is the most strongly influenced by the introduction

of TCM, the remainder of this report will be concerned 
with CeO2. 
3.2. Effect of thepartialpressure o 
fOe on CeOz 
As expected, either with or without TCM, the conver- 
sion on CeO2 increases with the partial pressure of oxy- 
gen P(O2) at 773 K (fig. 3). However, on introduction of 
TCM, at all of the three values of P(O2) the selectivities 
to C2H4 are substantially increased, while those to COx 
decrease and the proportion of CO in the latter becomes 
significant. 
At 973 K (fig. 4) the conversion of C2H6 at the lowest 
P(O2) is increased when TCM is present, but with 
increasing P(O2) the effect of TCM on the conversion is 
diminished and at the highest P(O2) leads to a decrease 
in the conversion. However, at this higher temperature 
the beneficial effect of TCM on the selectivity to C2H4 is 
again evident but the magnitude of the increase at this 
temperature is less than that observed at 773 K. While at 
973 K the selectivity to CO changes relatively little on 
addition of TCM that to CO2 is again reduced, but either

with or without TCM increases with P(O2) as does that 
to the total C1 selectivities. 
XRD patterns of CeO2 previously employed in the 
oxidation process show that only CeO2 is present (not 
shown), as found similarly with CeO2 samples which had 
been used in the oxidative coupling of methane in the 
presence of TCM [12]. However, XP spectra show the 
presence of C1 2p on CeO2 after use in oxidation as well 
as the expected O 1 
s and C13d5/2, the binding energies of 
which remain invariant with changes in P(O2), the intro- 
duction of TCM or argon-ion etching (table 2). The Ce/ 
O ratio prior to etching was, under all experimental con- 
ditions, smaller than that found after etching, indicating 
the surface excess of oxygen existing after the oxidation 
process. In contrast the C1/Ce ratio obtained from XPS 
decreased after etching as expected for a surface excess 
of chlorine produced during the reaction where TCM 
was present. 
Although it is evident that chlorine is present in the 
interfacial region of CeO2 after use in the ethane reac- 
tion, in the presence of TCM no chlorine, at least within 
the detection capabilities of XRD, is found in the bulk 
under the conditions employed in these experiments. 
Since the C1/Ce ratios are reduced by factors as large as 
3 after argon-ion etching for 1 min the chlorine is appar- 
ently predominantly held within the outer portion of the 
surface region. It is therefore improbable that the chlor- 
ine is distributed uniformly 
over the surface region of 
the 
catalyst particles, thus rendering the identification of the 
chlorided compound difficult, if not impossible. In view 
of the relatively small values found for C1/Ce it is tempt- 
ing to suggest that at least the localized form of the 
chlorided surface more closely resembles CeOC1 rather 
than CeCI3. 
3.3. Effect of 
the 
partial 
pressure of TCM 
At 773 K both the conversion of ethane and the selec- 
tivity to C2H4 increase 
with P(TCM) with relatively 
little 
change with time-on-stream (fig. 5). Concomitantly the 
C1 selectivities decrease but, as expected from the earlier 
observations, the formation of CO2 is suppressed and 
that of CO enhanced on the introduction of TCM at the 
lowest P(TCM). Somewhat similar results are found at 
973 K although the conversion appears to reach a maxi-

mum and methane first appears at the lowest P(TCM), 
At the higher temperature the C2+ selectivities are higher 
while those of C1 are lower than observed at the lower 
temperature. 
Values for C1 
/ Ce of the catalysts previously employed 
in obtaining the results shown in fig. 5 show little or no 
dependence on the reaction temperature, but some 
dependence on P(TCM), not surprisingly, is evident 
(table 3). Since no correlation between these results and 
those obtained from the catalytic studies is evident, it 
may be concluded that even at the lowest P(TCM) 
employed in the present work sufficient of the chlori- 
nated species, presumably CeOC1, is present to alter the 
course of the reaction. 
3.4. Ethane oxidation on CeO2 
pretreated with TCM 
Pretreatment of CeO2 with TCM, in the absence of 
ethane, results in the chlorination of the surface of the 
catalyst apparently with the formation of CeOC1 which 
may exist in the form of patches quite probably localized 
with respect to their depths and breadths (table 3). Since 
no dependence of the quantity of CeOC1 formed on the 
duration of pretreatment is seen, rapid achievement of

ment. In the absence of TCM in the feedstream the con- 
version of ethane and the selectivities to C1 and C2+ at

This is almost equally so at 973 K except for the appear- 
ance of 
methane on the catalysts pretreated with TCM. 
3.5. Ethane oxidation on CeCI3 
supported on Ce02 
Earlier work has shown that, with magnesium-con- 
taining catalysts, the introduction of TCM in the ODE 
results in the formation of the chloride, to which the 
enhancement in the reaction is ascribed [6-8]. To com- 
pare these earlier results with those in the present work 
catalysts with CeC13 loaded on CeO2 were employed in 
the ODE. At both 773 and 973 K, in either the absence or 
presence of TCM, the introduction of CeC13 produced 
little or no changes in the conversion and selectivities, 
although the presence of TCM in the feedstream pro- 
duced the expected advantageous results (figs. 7 and 8). 
Therefore it is concluded that the contribution of CeC13 
to the catalytic properties of CeO2 in the ODE is 
negligible.

definitive explanation of the nature of the effect pro- 
duced by the introduction of chlorine into the ODE 
feedstream, the results from the present work add some 
additional pieces to the puzzle. While the participation 
of the chloride ion contained within the surface region 
could be direct or indirect, since large concentrations of 
this ion as found in CeC13 are apparently not beneficial 
it can be concluded that the effect is indirect rather than 
direct. The chloride ions may be perturbing the electron 
density of the surface oxygen ions or merely serving as a 
diluent for the latter species. In either case, however, 
the net effect is to produce an enhancement of the con- 
version of ethane and the selectivity to ethylene when 
the chlorided surface is available, thus implying a sur- 
face-dependence of both the conversion and the selec- 
tivity. Although the surface and its composition are 
undoubtedly important in the production of free radi- 
cals from ethane, the nature of the participation of the 
surface in enhancing the selectivity to ethylene is less 
evident. However, increases in the selectivity to ethy- 
lene apparently result from reductions in the selectiv- 
ities to products which would result from the further 
oxidation of ethylene and consequently the chlorided 
surface appears to suppress this disadvantageous pro- 
cess. This is consistent with the results reported earlier 
on the suppression of the oxidation of CO by such 
surfaces.

4. Conclusion 
In contrast to the earlier observations from the oxida- 
tive coupling of methane in the presence and absence of 
TCM, on rare earth oxides, the use of TCM in the ODE 
at 773 and 973 K produced beneficial effects on CeO2 
but not on the remaining three rare earth oxides exam- 
ined. The addition of TCM to the ODE feedstream is 
shown from XPS to introduce surface C1 on the CeO2, 
forming CeOC1 which is apparently responsible for the 
enhancement observed in the reactions catalyzed with 
CeO2. Since the homogeneous reaction participates in 
the ethane conversion process to a considerably greater 
extent at 973 K, the effects due to the chlorinated sur- 
faces are diminished at this temperature.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
