[1] "The role of the chloride modifier seems to consist in poisoning the catalyst surface and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen, which in consequence leads mainly to an exclusion of the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[2] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[3] "The most probable cause of the modifying action of chloride ions is the poisoning of the catalyst surface by them and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. In consequence, there decreases the rate of all the stages of the process taking place with its participation, i.e., the activation of methane, which is manifested as a decrease in the degree of the conversion and successive transformations of hydrocarbons leading up to their complete oxidation."

[4] "It was also noted that chloride ions neutralize the strong basicity of the surface of catalysts Li/MgO [25,27], Na/CaO [21], BaCl2/CaO [14] or Na/MnMgO [19]."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in metal oxide catalysts like Na/CaO modifies the surface chemistry in several ways:

1. It poisons the catalyst surface by decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. This reduces the overall catalytic activity, especially for the most active sites involved in methane activation and complete oxidation.

2. It neutralizes the strong basicity of the catalyst surface. 

3. It selectively poisons different types of active sites, affecting both highly active and less active oxygen-containing sites.

The implications for catalytic activity and active centers include:

1. Decreased overall catalytic activity and methane conversion.

2. Reduced rates of complete oxidation, leading to improved selectivity for partial oxidation products like C2 hydrocarbons.

3. Changes in the nature and distribution of active sites, with the most active sites being poisoned first.

4. Potential creation of new types of active sites at higher chloride loadings.

For industrially relevant reactions like oxidative coupling of methane, this results in:

1. Lower methane conversion but improved selectivity to desired C2+ products at optimal chloride loadings.

2. Need for higher reaction temperatures to maintain activity.

3. Longer contact times required for secondary reactions like ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene.

4. Potential for tuning catalyst performance by controlling chloride content.

Overall, chloride doping allows for modification of catalytic properties, but requires careful optimization to balance activity and selectivity improvements.

在Na/CaO等金属氧化物催化剂中进行氯离子取代阳离子掺杂会以几种方式改变表面化学性质：

1. 它会毒化催化剂表面，减少具有活性氧的位点数量。这降低了整体催化活性，特别是对于参与甲烷活化和完全氧化的最活跃位点。

2. 它中和了催化剂表面的强碱性。

3. 它选择性地毒化不同类型的活性位点，影响高活性和低活性的含氧位点。

对催化活性和活性中心的影响包括：

1. 整体催化活性和甲烷转化率下降。

2. 完全氧化速率降低，导致部分氧化产物（如C2烃）的选择性提高。

3. 活性位点的性质和分布发生变化，最活跃的位点首先被毒化。

4. 在较高氯化物负载下可能创造新类型的活性位点。

对于甲烷氧化偶联等工业相关反应，这导致：

1. 在最佳氯化物含量下，甲烷转化率降低，但对所需C2+产物的选择性提高。

2. 需要更高的反应温度来维持活性。

3. 需要更长的接触时间进行乙烷脱氢生成乙烯等二次反应。

4. 通过控制氯化物含量来调整催化剂性能的潜力。

总的来说，氯化物掺杂允许修饰催化性能，但需要仔细优化以平衡活性和选择性的改进。
