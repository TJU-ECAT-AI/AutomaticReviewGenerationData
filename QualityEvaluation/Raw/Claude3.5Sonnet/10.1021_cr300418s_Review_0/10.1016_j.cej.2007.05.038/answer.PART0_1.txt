[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[4] "It is worth noticing that the optimum contents of about 2 wt.% of chloride ions in catalyst Na/CaO, corresponding to the atomic ratio Cl/Na equal to 0.85, is close to that established by Lunsford et al. for catalyst Li/MgO used in the reactions of the oxidative coupling of methane [25] and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [20]."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in Na/CaO catalysts modifies surface chemistry by poisoning active sites and disrupting chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It diminishes the number of sites with active oxygen, particularly excluding the most active sites from methane transformations. This reduces overall catalytic activity but can improve selectivity.

2. It poisons sites containing less active oxygen where CH3 radicals and C2 hydrocarbons form. This further reduces activity but can enhance selectivity to desired products.

3. There is an optimal chloride content (around 2 wt%) that maximizes selectivity improvements while minimizing activity loss. This suggests a balance between poisoning overly active sites and maintaining sufficient activity.

4. The effects are temperature-dependent, with more pronounced impacts at lower temperatures where only the most active sites participate.

5. For industrially relevant reactions like oxidative coupling of methane, chloride modification can improve selectivity to valuable C2 products, especially at higher temperatures and longer contact times.

6. The optimal Cl/Na ratio is similar across different catalysts (e.g. Na/CaO and Li/MgO), indicating a general principle for alkali metal oxide catalysts modified with chloride.

Overall, chloride doping provides a way to tune catalyst surface chemistry and active sites to enhance selectivity in certain reactions, though at the cost of some activity loss. Careful optimization of dopant levels and reaction conditions is needed to maximize benefits.

氯离子在Na/CaO催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂通过毒化活性位点和破坏化学键来修饰表面化学，其方式有几种：

1. 它减少了具有活性氧的位点数量，特别是排除了最活跃的位点参与甲烷转化。这降低了整体催化活性，但可以提高选择性。

2. 它毒化了含有较少活性氧的位点，这些位点是CH3自由基和C2烃形成的地方。这进一步降低了活性，但可以提高对所需产物的选择性。

3. 存在一个最佳氯含量（约2 wt%），可以在最大程度提高选择性改进的同时最小化活性损失。这表明在毒化过度活跃的位点和维持足够活性之间存在平衡。

4. 这些效果依赖于温度，在较低温度下影响更为显著，因为此时只有最活跃的位点参与反应。

5. 对于工业相关反应，如甲烷氧化偶联，氯化物修饰可以提高对有价值的C2产物的选择性，特别是在较高温度和较长接触时间下。

6. 最佳Cl/Na比例在不同催化剂（如Na/CaO和Li/MgO）中相似，表明这是碱金属氧化物催化剂经氯化物修饰的一般原理。

总的来说，氯掺杂提供了一种调节催化剂表面化学和活性位点的方法，以提高某些反应中的选择性，尽管代价是一些活性损失。需要仔细优化掺杂剂水平和反应条件以最大化收益。
