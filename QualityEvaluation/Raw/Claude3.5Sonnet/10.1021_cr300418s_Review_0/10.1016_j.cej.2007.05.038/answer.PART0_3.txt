[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[4] "It seems that at high temperatures of the reaction, the surface concentration of the active form of oxygen is still sufficiently high to enable the possibility of intensive secondary transformations of ethane to ethylene and, on subsequent stages, to hydrocarbons C3+."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in Na/CaO catalysts modifies the surface chemistry by:

1. Poisoning the catalyst surface and reducing the number of active oxygen sites. This primarily excludes the most active sites from methane transformations.

2. Potentially poisoning sites with less active oxygen where CH3 radicals and C2 hydrocarbons form.

3. Altering the surface concentration of active oxygen forms.

The implications for catalytic activity and active centers include:

1. Generally decreased overall catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures.

2. Increased selectivity for C2+ hydrocarbons at optimal chloride ion concentrations (around 2 wt%).

3. Changes in the nature and distribution of active sites, with the most active sites being poisoned first.

4. Potential creation of new sites for complete oxidation at high chloride concentrations.

For industrially relevant reactions like oxidative coupling of methane (OCM):

1. Improved total selectivity and ethane formation selectivity at optimal chloride content.

2. Enhanced ethylene formation selectivity at higher reaction temperatures.

3. Requirement for higher reaction temperatures and longer contact times to achieve improved performance.

4. Potential for tailoring catalyst properties by controlling chloride ion content to optimize desired product yields and selectivities.

氯离子在Na/CaO催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂通过以下方式改变表面化学性质：

1. 毒化催化剂表面并减少活性氧位点的数量。这主要排除了最活跃的位点参与甲烷转化。

2. 可能毒化含有较不活跃氧的位点，这些位点是CH3自由基和C2烃形成的地方。

3. 改变表面活性氧形式的浓度。

对催化活性和活性中心的影响包括：

1. 总体催化活性通常降低，尤其在较低温度下。

2. 在最佳氯离子浓度（约2 wt%）下，C2+烃的选择性提高。

3. 活性位点的性质和分布发生变化，最活跃的位点首先被毒化。

4. 在高氯浓度下可能创造新的完全氧化位点。

对于工业相关反应如甲烷氧化偶联(OCM)：

1. 在最佳氯含量下，总选择性和乙烷形成选择性提高。

2. 在较高反应温度下，乙烯形成选择性增强。

3. 需要更高的反应温度和更长的接触时间才能获得改善的性能。

4. 通过控制氯离子含量来调整催化剂性能，以优化所需产品的产率和选择性的潜力。
