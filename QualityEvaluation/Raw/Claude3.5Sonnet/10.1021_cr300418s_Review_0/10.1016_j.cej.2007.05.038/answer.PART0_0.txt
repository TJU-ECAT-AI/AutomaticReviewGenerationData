[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "The most probable cause of the modifying action of chloride ions is the poisoning of the catalyst surface by them and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. In consequence, there decreases the rate of all the stages of the process taking place with its participation, i.e., the activation of methane, which is manifested as a decrease in the degree of the conversion and successive transformations of hydrocarbons leading up to their complete oxidation."

[4] "It was also noted that chloride ions neutralize the strong basicity of the surface of catalysts Li/MgO [25,27], Na/CaO [21], BaCl2/CaO [14] or Na/MnMgO [19]. In catalyst Li/MgO, small amounts of chloride ions are preferentially sited at low coordinate sites [51] and an analogous localization of chloride ions may be expected in catalyst Na/CaO."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in metal oxide catalysts like Na/CaO modifies surface chemistry by:

1. Poisoning the catalyst surface and reducing the number of active oxygen sites, particularly the most active sites.

2. Neutralizing the strong basicity of the catalyst surface.

3. Preferentially locating at low coordination sites on the surface.

This surface modification has several implications:

1. It generally decreases catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures, by reducing methane activation and conversion.

2. It changes the nature and location of active centers by poisoning the most active sites and creating new sites with different reactivity.

3. It can improve selectivity in reactions like oxidative coupling of methane by inhibiting complete oxidation pathways. 

4. The effects are highly dependent on the amount of chloride doping, with an optimal content around 2 wt% for Na/CaO catalysts.

5. Higher reaction temperatures are required to achieve benefits from the chloride modification.

Overall, chloride doping provides a method to tune the reactivity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts, but requires careful optimization of dopant levels and reaction conditions to realize improvements in industrially relevant reactions.

在Na/CaO等金属氧化物催化剂中进行氯离子取代阳离子掺杂会通过以下方式改变表面化学性质：

1. 毒化催化剂表面并减少活性氧位点的数量，特别是最活跃的位点。

2. 中和催化剂表面的强碱性。

3. 优先定位于表面的低配位位点。

这种表面改性有几个影响：

1. 它通常会降低催化活性，特别是在较低温度下，因为减少了甲烷的活化和转化。

2. 它通过毒化最活跃的位点并创造具有不同反应性的新位点，改变了活性中心的性质和位置。

3. 它可以通过抑制完全氧化途径来提高甲烷氧化偶联等反应的选择性。

4. 这些效果高度依赖于氯离子掺杂的量，对于Na/CaO催化剂，最佳含量约为2 wt%。

5. 需要更高的反应温度才能从氯化物改性中获得益处。

总的来说，氯离子掺杂提供了一种调节金属氧化物催化剂反应性和选择性的方法，但需要仔细优化掺杂剂水平和反应条件，以实现工业相关反应的改进。
