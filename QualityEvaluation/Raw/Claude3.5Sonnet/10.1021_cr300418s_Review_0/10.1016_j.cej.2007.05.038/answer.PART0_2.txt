[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "There is an optimum contents of chloride ions in the catalyst, about 2 wt.%, at which the increase in the selectivity of the formation of C2+ hydrocarbons is the largest in comparison with the value obtained with the chloride-free catalyst."

[4] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[5] "It seems that at high temperatures of the reaction, the surface concentration of the active form of oxygen is still sufficiently high to enable the possibility of intensive secondary transformations of ethane to ethylene and, on subsequent stages, to hydrocarbons C3+."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in Na/CaO metal oxide catalysts modifies the surface chemistry by poisoning active sites and reducing the number of sites with active oxygen. This disrupts the chemical bonding at the catalyst surface.

The implications for catalytic activity are complex:

1. It generally decreases overall catalytic activity and conversion, especially at lower temperatures. 

2. However, it enhances selectivity for desired C2+ hydrocarbon products at small dopant concentrations (around 2 wt% Cl-).

3. It alters the nature and location of active centers by preferentially poisoning the most active sites first.

4. At higher temperatures, it can improve selectivity for ethylene formation through secondary reactions.

5. For industrially relevant methane oxidative coupling reactions, chloride doping allows for higher temperature operation with improved C2+ selectivity, though at reduced overall conversion.

The optimal doping level balances decreased activity with improved selectivity. Careful control of reaction conditions (temperature, contact time, oxygen concentration) is needed to maximize the benefits of the chloride dopant.

在Na/CaO金属氧化物催化剂中进行氯离子取代阳离子掺杂会通过毒化活性位点和减少含有活性氧的位点数量来修饰表面化学性质。这扰乱了催化剂表面的化学键合。

对催化活性的影响是复杂的:

1. 它通常会降低整体催化活性和转化率,尤其是在较低温度下。

2. 然而,在较小的掺杂浓度(约2 wt% Cl-)下,它会提高目标C2+烃类产物的选择性。

3. 它通过优先毒化最活跃的位点来改变活性中心的性质和位置。

4. 在较高温度下,它可以通过次级反应提高乙烯生成的选择性。

5. 对于工业相关的甲烷氧化偶联反应,氯化物掺杂允许在更高温度下操作,提高C2+选择性,但总体转化率降低。

最佳掺杂水平平衡了活性降低和选择性提高。需要仔细控制反应条件(温度、接触时间、氧气浓度)以最大化氯化物掺杂剂的益处。
