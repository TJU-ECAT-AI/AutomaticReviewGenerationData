[1] "The positive influence of the presence of chloride ions is evident at their relatively small contents in the catalyst and specific effects depend mainly on the reaction temperature."

[2] "The operation of the chloride modifier consists in poisoning the catalyst surface and diminishing the number of sites with active oxygen, which results in excluding primarily the most active of these sites from methane transformations."

[3] "The most probable cause of the modifying action of chloride ions is the poisoning of the catalyst surface by them and decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. In consequence, there decreases the rate of all the stages of the process taking place with its participation, i.e., the activation of methane, which is manifested as a decrease in the degree of the conversion and successive transformations of hydrocarbons leading up to their complete oxidation."

[4] "It was also noted that chloride ions neutralize the strong basicity of the surface of catalysts Li/MgO [25,27], Na/CaO [21], BaCl2/CaO [14] or Na/MnMgO [19]. In catalyst Li/MgO, small amounts of chloride ions are preferentially sited at low coordinate sites [51] and an analogous localization of chloride ions may be expected in catalyst Na/CaO."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in metal oxide catalysts like Na/CaO modifies surface chemistry by:

1. Poisoning the catalyst surface and reducing the number of active oxygen sites, particularly the most active sites.

2. Neutralizing the strong basicity of the catalyst surface.

3. Preferentially locating at low coordination sites on the surface.

This surface modification has several implications:

1. It generally decreases catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures, by reducing methane activation and conversion.

2. It changes the nature and location of active centers by poisoning the most active sites and creating new sites with different reactivity.

3. It can improve selectivity in reactions like oxidative coupling of methane by inhibiting complete oxidation pathways. 

4. The effects are highly dependent on the amount of chloride doping, with an optimal content around 2 wt% for Na/CaO catalysts.

5. Higher reaction temperatures are required to achieve benefits from the chloride modification.

Overall, chloride doping provides a method to tune the reactivity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts, but requires careful optimization of dopant levels and reaction conditions to realize improvements in industrially relevant reactions.

在Na/CaO等金属氧化物催化剂中进行氯离子取代阳离子掺杂会通过以下方式改变表面化学性质：

1. 毒化催化剂表面并减少活性氧位点的数量，特别是最活跃的位点。

2. 中和催化剂表面的强碱性。

3. 优先定位于表面的低配位位点。

这种表面改性有几个影响：

1. 它通常会降低催化活性，特别是在较低温度下，因为减少了甲烷的活化和转化。

2. 它通过毒化最活跃的位点并创造具有不同反应性的新位点，改变了活性中心的性质和位置。

3. 它可以通过抑制完全氧化途径来提高甲烷氧化偶联等反应的选择性。

4. 这些效果高度依赖于氯离子掺杂的量，对于Na/CaO催化剂，最佳含量约为2 wt%。

5. 需要更高的反应温度才能从氯化物改性中获得益处。

总的来说，氯离子掺杂提供了一种调节金属氧化物催化剂反应性和选择性的方法，但需要仔细优化掺杂剂水平和反应条件，以实现工业相关反应的改进。

[3] "Chloride ions may also poison those sites on the catalyst surface, which contain less active oxygen, at which there are formed first CH3 radicals and then C2 hydrocarbons."

[4] "It is worth noticing that the optimum contents of about 2 wt.% of chloride ions in catalyst Na/CaO, corresponding to the atomic ratio Cl/Na equal to 0.85, is close to that established by Lunsford et al. for catalyst Li/MgO used in the reactions of the oxidative coupling of methane [25] and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [20]."

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in Na/CaO catalysts modifies surface chemistry by poisoning active sites and disrupting chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It diminishes the number of sites with active oxygen, particularly excluding the most active sites from methane transformations. This reduces overall catalytic activity but can improve selectivity.

2. It poisons sites containing less active oxygen where CH3 radicals and C2 hydrocarbons form. This further reduces activity but can enhance selectivity to desired products.

3. There is an optimal chloride content (around 2 wt%) that maximizes selectivity improvements while minimizing activity loss. This suggests a balance between poisoning overly active sites and maintaining sufficient activity.

4. The effects are temperature-dependent, with more pronounced impacts at lower temperatures where only the most active sites participate.

5. For industrially relevant reactions like oxidative coupling of methane, chloride modification can improve selectivity to valuable C2 products, especially at higher temperatures and longer contact times.

6. The optimal Cl/Na ratio is similar across different catalysts (e.g. Na/CaO and Li/MgO), indicating a general principle for alkali metal oxide catalysts modified with chloride.

Overall, chloride doping provides a way to tune catalyst surface chemistry and active sites to enhance selectivity in certain reactions, though at the cost of some activity loss. Careful optimization of dopant levels and reaction conditions is needed to maximize benefits.

氯离子在Na/CaO催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂通过毒化活性位点和破坏化学键来修饰表面化学，其方式有几种：

1. 它减少了具有活性氧的位点数量，特别是排除了最活跃的位点参与甲烷转化。这降低了整体催化活性，但可以提高选择性。

2. 它毒化了含有较少活性氧的位点，这些位点是CH3自由基和C2烃形成的地方。这进一步降低了活性，但可以提高对所需产物的选择性。

3. 存在一个最佳氯含量（约2 wt%），可以在最大程度提高选择性改进的同时最小化活性损失。这表明在毒化过度活跃的位点和维持足够活性之间存在平衡。

4. 这些效果依赖于温度，在较低温度下影响更为显著，因为此时只有最活跃的位点参与反应。

5. 对于工业相关反应，如甲烷氧化偶联，氯化物修饰可以提高对有价值的C2产物的选择性，特别是在较高温度和较长接触时间下。

6. 最佳Cl/Na比例在不同催化剂（如Na/CaO和Li/MgO）中相似，表明这是碱金属氧化物催化剂经氯化物修饰的一般原理。

总的来说，氯掺杂提供了一种调节催化剂表面化学和活性位点的方法，以提高某些反应中的选择性，尽管代价是一些活性损失。需要仔细优化掺杂剂水平和反应条件以最大化收益。

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in Na/CaO metal oxide catalysts modifies the surface chemistry by poisoning active sites and reducing the number of sites with active oxygen. This disrupts the chemical bonding at the catalyst surface.

The implications for catalytic activity are complex:

1. It generally decreases overall catalytic activity and conversion, especially at lower temperatures. 

2. However, it enhances selectivity for desired C2+ hydrocarbon products at small dopant concentrations (around 2 wt% Cl-).

3. It alters the nature and location of active centers by preferentially poisoning the most active sites first.

4. At higher temperatures, it can improve selectivity for ethylene formation through secondary reactions.

5. For industrially relevant methane oxidative coupling reactions, chloride doping allows for higher temperature operation with improved C2+ selectivity, though at reduced overall conversion.

The optimal doping level balances decreased activity with improved selectivity. Careful control of reaction conditions (temperature, contact time, oxygen concentration) is needed to maximize the benefits of the chloride dopant.

在Na/CaO金属氧化物催化剂中进行氯离子取代阳离子掺杂会通过毒化活性位点和减少含有活性氧的位点数量来修饰表面化学性质。这扰乱了催化剂表面的化学键合。

对催化活性的影响是复杂的:

1. 它通常会降低整体催化活性和转化率,尤其是在较低温度下。

2. 然而,在较小的掺杂浓度(约2 wt% Cl-)下,它会提高目标C2+烃类产物的选择性。

3. 它通过优先毒化最活跃的位点来改变活性中心的性质和位置。

4. 在较高温度下,它可以通过次级反应提高乙烯生成的选择性。

5. 对于工业相关的甲烷氧化偶联反应,氯化物掺杂允许在更高温度下操作,提高C2+选择性,但总体转化率降低。

最佳掺杂水平平衡了活性降低和选择性提高。需要仔细控制反应条件(温度、接触时间、氧气浓度)以最大化氯化物掺杂剂的益处。

Substitutional cation doping with chloride ions in metal oxide catalysts like Na/CaO modifies the surface chemistry in several ways:

1. It poisons the catalyst surface by decreasing the number of sites with active oxygen. This reduces the overall catalytic activity, especially for the most active sites involved in methane activation and complete oxidation.

2. It neutralizes the strong basicity of the catalyst surface. 

3. It selectively poisons different types of active sites, affecting both highly active and less active oxygen-containing sites.

The implications for catalytic activity and active centers include:

1. Decreased overall catalytic activity and methane conversion.

2. Reduced rates of complete oxidation, leading to improved selectivity for partial oxidation products like C2 hydrocarbons.

3. Changes in the nature and distribution of active sites, with the most active sites being poisoned first.

4. Potential creation of new types of active sites at higher chloride loadings.

For industrially relevant reactions like oxidative coupling of methane, this results in:

1. Lower methane conversion but improved selectivity to desired C2+ products at optimal chloride loadings.

2. Need for higher reaction temperatures to maintain activity.

3. Longer contact times required for secondary reactions like ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene.

4. Potential for tuning catalyst performance by controlling chloride content.

Overall, chloride doping allows for modification of catalytic properties, but requires careful optimization to balance activity and selectivity improvements.
