[1] "Such systems have been extensively studied with respect to chemical reactions on them and a very close correspondence to powder catalysts was revealed."

[2] "The challenge is to control both shape and distribution. Thin films offer an opportunity to achieve this goal."

[3] "Netzer and co-workers have published a series of spectacular studies on vanadium-oxide thin films as a function of coverage and thickness, literally exploring the entire phase diagram."

[4] "First attempts in this direction have been undertaken by preparing well ordered silicates on metal surfaces with the goal to eventually exchange part of the silicon atoms by aluminium atoms."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it discusses related concepts of modifying oxide thin films to control their properties:

1. Thin oxide films can be used to model and study powder catalysts, showing close correspondence in reactivity.

2. The thickness and composition of oxide films can be controlled to tune their properties.

3. Studies have explored how varying the coverage and thickness of vanadium oxide films affects their phase diagram and properties. 

4. There have been attempts to prepare ordered silicate films on metal surfaces and exchange some silicon atoms with aluminum, which is a form of substitutional doping.

While not directly answering the question, these points suggest that controlled modification of oxide films, including substitutional doping, can be used to alter surface chemistry and catalytic properties in model catalyst systems. However, the specific effects on chemical bonding, active centers, and industrial reactions are not addressed in the given literature.

文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。但是，它讨论了修改氧化物薄膜以控制其性质的相关概念：

1. 氧化物薄膜可用于模拟和研究粉末催化剂，显示出反应性的密切对应关系。

2. 可以控制氧化物薄膜的厚度和成分来调节其性质。

3. 研究探索了改变钒氧化物薄膜的覆盖率和厚度如何影响其相图和性质。

4. 有人尝试在金属表面制备有序的硅酸盐薄膜，并将部分硅原子替换为铝原子，这是一种替代掺杂的形式。

虽然这些点没有直接回答问题，但它们表明，在模型催化剂系统中，可以通过对氧化物薄膜进行受控修饰（包括替代掺杂）来改变表面化学和催化性质。然而，给定的文献并未涉及对化学键合、活性中心和工业反应的具体影响。
