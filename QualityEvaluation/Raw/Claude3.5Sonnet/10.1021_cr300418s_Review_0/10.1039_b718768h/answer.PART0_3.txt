[1] "the reasons for the enhanced activity are not yet fully clarified. Some authors believe that this is due to the relatively large number of low-coordinated sites at the surface of a nanoparticle; some experiments point to a special role of the oxide support; in other studies it has been proposed that the reason for the enhanced activity is the oxidation state of gold;"

[2] "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials. There are several parameters which can be modified in a desired way, such as the type of oxide material (ionic or covalent, reducible or non-reducible, etc.), the nature of metal/oxide interface (strong or weak adhesion, lattice mismatch, position of metal Fermi level with respect to valence and conduction band of the oxide, charge transfer at the interface, etc.), or the thickness of the oxide film (from one to several ML)."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss how modifying supported metal nanoparticles can enhance catalytic activity. Key factors include:

1. Changing the oxidation state and charge of metal nanoparticles
2. Modifying the metal-oxide interface and interactions
3. Controlling nanoparticle size and shape
4. Tuning the oxide support properties (e.g. reducibility, thickness)

These modifications can create new active sites, alter electronic properties, and change metal-support interactions. While not specifically about cation doping, these principles could apply to how dopants might enhance catalytic properties by disrupting bonding and creating new active centers. The literature suggests such modifications open up possibilities for designing improved catalytic materials, though specific industrial reactions are not discussed.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂。然而,它确实讨论了如何修改负载的金属纳米粒子可以增强催化活性。关键因素包括:

1. 改变金属纳米粒子的氧化态和电荷
2. 修改金属-氧化物界面和相互作用
3. 控制纳米粒子的尺寸和形状  
4. 调节氧化物载体的性质(如可还原性、厚度)

这些修饰可以创造新的活性位点,改变电子性质,并改变金属-载体相互作用。虽然不是专门针对阳离子掺杂,但这些原理可能适用于掺杂剂如何通过破坏化学键和创造新的活性中心来增强催化性能。文献表明,这些修饰为设计改进的催化材料开辟了可能性,尽管没有讨论具体的工业反应。
