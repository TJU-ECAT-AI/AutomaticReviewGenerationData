[1] "The alumina film may be looked at as an ordered arrangement of holes, or a molecular sieve. Depending on the size of metal atoms, for example Pd vs. Au, the smaller Pd atom penetrates the two-dimensional silica network, while the bigger Au atom stays on top of the silica film, behavingindeedlike a molecular sieve."

[2] "By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

[3] "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss how modifying oxide thin films can alter the properties of supported metal catalysts. Specifically:

1. The structure of oxide thin films can act as a molecular sieve, selectively allowing certain metal atoms to penetrate while others remain on the surface. This can control the dispersion and interactions of catalytic metal particles.

2. The thickness of oxide films can be tuned to induce charge transfer to supported metal particles, changing their shape and electronic properties. This provides a way to modify the catalytic behavior of supported metals.

3. By controlling parameters like oxide material, metal-oxide interface, and film thickness, there is potential to design new catalytic materials with tailored properties. This could allow enhancement of catalytic activity and creation of new active centers, though specific reactions are not mentioned.

While not addressing cation doping directly, these findings suggest ways that modifying oxide supports can alter supported metal catalysts, which has implications for enhancing catalytic performance in industrially relevant reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的阳离子掺杂替代。但是,它确实讨论了如何通过修改氧化物薄膜来改变负载金属催化剂的性质。具体来说:

1. 氧化物薄膜的结构可以作为分子筛,选择性地允许某些金属原子渗透,而其他金属原子则留在表面。这可以控制催化金属颗粒的分散和相互作用。

2. 可以调节氧化物薄膜的厚度,诱导电荷转移到负载的金属颗粒上,改变它们的形状和电子性质。这提供了一种修改负载金属催化行为的方法。

3. 通过控制氧化物材料、金属-氧化物界面和薄膜厚度等参数,有可能设计出具有量身定制性质的新型催化材料。这可能允许增强催化活性并创造新的活性中心,尽管没有提到具体的反应。

虽然没有直接讨论阳离子掺杂,但这些发现表明,修改氧化物载体可以改变负载金属催化剂,这对提高工业相关反应的催化性能有影响。
