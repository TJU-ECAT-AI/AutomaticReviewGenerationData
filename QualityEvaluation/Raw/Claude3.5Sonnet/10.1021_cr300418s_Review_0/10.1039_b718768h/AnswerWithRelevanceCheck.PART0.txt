          "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials."

"By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

"Oxide ultra-thin films on metals offer new opportunities for the design of supported nanoclusters with potential use in catalysis."

"The alumina film may be looked at as an ordered arrangement of holes, or a molecular sieve. Depending on the size of metal atoms, for example Pd vs. Au, the smaller Pd atom penetrates the two-dimensional silica network, while the bigger Au atom stays on top of the silica film, behavingindeedlike a molecular sieve."

"Examples in this direction have been reported for several systems, and in particular for TiO2, an oxide which contains a relatively large amount of surface oxygen vacancies."

"The best proof of a change in the electronic structure of the metal cluster, and of the occurrence of a negative charging, is CO vibrational spectroscopy."

"the reasons for the enhanced activity are not yet fully clarified. Some authors believe that this is due to the relatively large number of low-coordinated sites at the surface of a nanoparticle; some experiments point to a special role of the oxide support; in other studies it has been proposed that the reason for the enhanced activity is the oxidation state of gold;"

"There are several parameters which can be modified in a desired way, such as the type of oxide material (ionic or covalent, reducible or non-reducible, etc.), the nature of metal/oxide interface (strong or weak adhesion, lattice mismatch, position of metal Fermi level with respect to valence and conduction band of the oxide, charge transfer at the interface, etc.), or the thickness of the oxide film (from one to several ML)."

"Such systems have been extensively studied with respect to chemical reactions on them and a very close correspondence to powder catalysts was revealed."

"The challenge is to control both shape and distribution. Thin films offer an opportunity to achieve this goal."

"Netzer and co-workers have published a series of spectacular studies on vanadium-oxide thin films as a function of coverage and thickness, literally exploring the entire phase diagram."

"First attempts in this direction have been undertaken by preparing well ordered silicates on metal surfaces with the goal to eventually exchange part of the silicon atoms by aluminium atoms."

          While the literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts, it discusses related concepts of modifying oxide thin films and supported metal nanoparticles to enhance catalytic properties. Key points include:

1. Modifying oxide film thickness can induce charge transfer to supported metal particles, altering their shape and electronic properties.

2. Oxide films can act as molecular sieves, controlling the dispersion and interactions of catalytic metal particles.

3. Defects like oxygen vacancies in reducible oxides (e.g., TiO2) can modify the electronic structure of supported metal clusters.

4. CO vibrational spectroscopy can provide evidence for changes in the electronic structure and charge state of supported metal clusters.

5. Several parameters can be modified to design new catalytic materials, including oxide material type, metal-oxide interface properties, and oxide film thickness.

6. Thin oxide films can be used to model and study powder catalysts, showing close correspondence in reactivity.

7. Studies have explored how varying the coverage and thickness of oxide films (e.g., vanadium oxide) affects their phase diagram and properties.

8. There have been attempts to prepare ordered silicate films on metal surfaces and exchange some silicon atoms with aluminum, which is a form of substitutional doping.

These modifications can create new active sites, alter electronic properties, and change metal-support interactions. While not specifically about cation doping, these principles could apply to how dopants might enhance catalytic properties by disrupting bonding and creating new active centers. The literature suggests such modifications open up possibilities for designing improved catalytic materials, though specific industrial reactions are not discussed.

          虽然文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂，但它讨论了修改氧化物薄膜和负载金属纳米粒子以增强催化性能的相关概念。主要要点包括：

1. 修改氧化物薄膜厚度可以诱导电荷转移到负载的金属颗粒上，改变它们的形状和电子性质。

2. 氧化物薄膜可以作为分子筛，控制催化金属颗粒的分散和相互作用。

3. 可还原氧化物（如TiO2）中的氧空位等缺陷可以修改负载金属团簇的电子结构。

4. CO振动光谱可以为负载金属团簇电子结构和电荷状态的变化提供证据。

5. 可以修改多个参数来设计新的催化材料，包括氧化物材料类型、金属-氧化物界面性质和氧化物薄膜厚度。

6. 氧化物薄膜可用于模拟和研究粉末催化剂，显示出反应性的密切对应关系。

7. 研究探索了改变氧化物薄膜（如钒氧化物）的覆盖率和厚度如何影响其相图和性质。

8. 有人尝试在金属表面制备有序的硅酸盐薄膜，并将部分硅原子替换为铝原子，这是一种替代掺杂的形式。

这些修饰可以创造新的活性位点，改变电子性质，并改变金属-载体相互作用。虽然不是专门针对阳离子掺杂，但这些原理可能适用于掺杂剂如何通过破坏化学键和创造新的活性中心来增强催化性能。文献表明，这些修饰为设计改进的催化材料开辟了可能性，尽管没有讨论具体的工业反应。
