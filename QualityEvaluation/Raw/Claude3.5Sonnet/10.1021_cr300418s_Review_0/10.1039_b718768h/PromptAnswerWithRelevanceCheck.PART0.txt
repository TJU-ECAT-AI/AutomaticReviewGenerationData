[1] "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials."

[2] "By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

[3] "Oxide ultra-thin films on metals offer new opportunities for the design of supported nanoclusters with potential use in catalysis."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it discusses how ultrathin oxide films on metal supports can be used to modify the properties of supported metal nanoparticles, which has implications for catalyst design. By controlling the oxide film thickness, it is possible to induce charge transfer to supported metal particles, altering their shape and electronic structure. This opens up new possibilities for tuning catalytic activity and designing novel catalytic materials. While not exactly the same as cation doping, this approach provides a way to modify surface chemistry and electronic properties of supported catalysts, potentially enhancing their activity or creating new types of active sites.

[1] "The alumina film may be looked at as an ordered arrangement of holes, or a molecular sieve. Depending on the size of metal atoms, for example Pd vs. Au, the smaller Pd atom penetrates the two-dimensional silica network, while the bigger Au atom stays on top of the silica film, behavingindeedlike a molecular sieve."

[2] "By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

[3] "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss how modifying oxide thin films can alter the properties of supported metal catalysts. Specifically:

1. The structure of oxide thin films can act as a molecular sieve, selectively allowing certain metal atoms to penetrate while others remain on the surface. This can control the dispersion and interactions of catalytic metal particles.

2. The thickness of oxide films can be tuned to induce charge transfer to supported metal particles, changing their shape and electronic properties. This provides a way to modify the catalytic behavior of supported metals.

3. By controlling parameters like oxide material, metal-oxide interface, and film thickness, there is potential to design new catalytic materials with tailored properties. This could allow enhancement of catalytic activity and creation of new active centers, though specific reactions are not mentioned.

While not addressing cation doping directly, these findings suggest ways that modifying oxide supports can alter supported metal catalysts, which has implications for enhancing catalytic performance in industrially relevant reactions.

[2] "By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

[3] "Examples in this direction have been reported for several systems, and in particular for TiO2, an oxide which contains a relatively large amount of surface oxygen vacancies."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss related concepts of modifying supported metal nanoparticles through oxide film thickness and defects. 

Changing the thickness of oxide support films can induce spontaneous charge transfer to supported metal particles, altering their shape and electronic properties. This opens up possibilities for designing new catalytic materials with tunable properties.

Defects like oxygen vacancies in reducible oxides like TiO2 can also modify the electronic structure of supported metal clusters. This can lead to electron-rich metal clusters with enhanced chemical activity.

CO vibrational spectroscopy provides evidence for changes in the electronic structure and charge state of supported metal clusters. Shifts in CO vibrational frequencies indicate changes in the metal's oxidation state or degree of electron richness.

While not discussing substitutional doping specifically, these examples demonstrate how modifying oxide supports can alter the electronic properties of catalysts and potentially enhance their activity. Further research would be needed to determine the specific effects of cation doping on surface chemistry, bonding, and catalytic properties.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。但是,它确实讨论了通过氧化物薄膜厚度和缺陷来修饰负载金属纳米粒子的相关概念。

改变氧化物支撑薄膜的厚度可以诱导自发的电荷转移到负载的金属颗粒上,改变它们的形状和电子性质。这为设计具有可调性能的新型催化材料开辟了可能性。

像TiO2这样的可还原氧化物中的氧空位等缺陷也可以修改负载金属团簇的电子结构。这可以导致电子丰富的金属团簇,增强其化学活性。

CO振动光谱为负载金属团簇电子结构和电荷状态的变化提供了证据。CO振动频率的移动表明金属的氧化态或电子丰富程度发生了变化。

虽然没有具体讨论替代掺杂,但这些例子表明,修改氧化物支撑物可以改变催化剂的电子性质,并可能增强其活性。还需要进一步的研究来确定阳离子掺杂对表面化学、化学键和催化性质的具体影响。

[1] "the reasons for the enhanced activity are not yet fully clarified. Some authors believe that this is due to the relatively large number of low-coordinated sites at the surface of a nanoparticle; some experiments point to a special role of the oxide support; in other studies it has been proposed that the reason for the enhanced activity is the oxidation state of gold;"

[2] "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials. There are several parameters which can be modified in a desired way, such as the type of oxide material (ionic or covalent, reducible or non-reducible, etc.), the nature of metal/oxide interface (strong or weak adhesion, lattice mismatch, position of metal Fermi level with respect to valence and conduction band of the oxide, charge transfer at the interface, etc.), or the thickness of the oxide film (from one to several ML)."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss how modifying supported metal nanoparticles can enhance catalytic activity. Key factors include:

1. Changing the oxidation state and charge of metal nanoparticles
2. Modifying the metal-oxide interface and interactions
3. Controlling nanoparticle size and shape
4. Tuning the oxide support properties (e.g. reducibility, thickness)

These modifications can create new active sites, alter electronic properties, and change metal-support interactions. While not specifically about cation doping, these principles could apply to how dopants might enhance catalytic properties by disrupting bonding and creating new active centers. The literature suggests such modifications open up possibilities for designing improved catalytic materials, though specific industrial reactions are not discussed.

[1] "Such systems have been extensively studied with respect to chemical reactions on them and a very close correspondence to powder catalysts was revealed."

[2] "The challenge is to control both shape and distribution. Thin films offer an opportunity to achieve this goal."

[3] "Netzer and co-workers have published a series of spectacular studies on vanadium-oxide thin films as a function of coverage and thickness, literally exploring the entire phase diagram."

[4] "First attempts in this direction have been undertaken by preparing well ordered silicates on metal surfaces with the goal to eventually exchange part of the silicon atoms by aluminium atoms."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it discusses related concepts of modifying oxide thin films to control their properties:

1. Thin oxide films can be used to model and study powder catalysts, showing close correspondence in reactivity.

2. The thickness and composition of oxide films can be controlled to tune their properties.

3. Studies have explored how varying the coverage and thickness of vanadium oxide films affects their phase diagram and properties. 

4. There have been attempts to prepare ordered silicate films on metal surfaces and exchange some silicon atoms with aluminum, which is a form of substitutional doping.

While not directly answering the question, these points suggest that controlled modification of oxide films, including substitutional doping, can be used to alter surface chemistry and catalytic properties in model catalyst systems. However, the specific effects on chemical bonding, active centers, and industrial reactions are not addressed in the given literature.
