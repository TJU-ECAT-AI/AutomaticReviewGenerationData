The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it discusses how ultrathin oxide films on metal supports can be used to modify the properties of supported metal nanoparticles, which has implications for catalyst design. By controlling the oxide film thickness, it is possible to induce charge transfer to supported metal particles, altering their shape and electronic structure. This opens up new possibilities for tuning catalytic activity and designing novel catalytic materials. While not exactly the same as cation doping, this approach provides a way to modify surface chemistry and electronic properties of supported catalysts, potentially enhancing their activity or creating new types of active sites.

文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的阳离子取代掺杂。然而,它讨论了如何利用金属支撑体上的超薄氧化物薄膜来改变负载金属纳米颗粒的性质,这对催化剂设计有重要意义。通过控制氧化物薄膜厚度,可以诱导电荷转移到负载的金属颗粒上,从而改变它们的形状和电子结构。这为调节催化活性和设计新型催化材料开辟了新的可能性。虽然这种方法与阳离子掺杂不完全相同,但它提供了一种修改负载催化剂表面化学和电子性质的方法,potentially提高其活性或创造新型活性位点。
