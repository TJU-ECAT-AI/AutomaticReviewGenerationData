[1] "The possibility to modify the charge state and the shape of a supported nanoparticle opens fascinating perspectives for the design of new catalytic materials."

[2] "By tuning the thickness of the oxide film, one can stimulate a spontaneous charge transfer to a supported metal particle with consequent change in shape and electronic properties."

[3] "Examples in this direction have been reported for several systems, and in particular for TiO2, an oxide which contains a relatively large amount of surface oxygen vacancies."

[4] "The best proof of a change in the electronic structure of the metal cluster, and of the occurrence of a negative charging, is CO vibrational spectroscopy."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss related concepts of modifying supported metal nanoparticles through oxide film thickness and defects. 

Changing the thickness of oxide support films can induce spontaneous charge transfer to supported metal particles, altering their shape and electronic properties. This opens up possibilities for designing new catalytic materials with tunable properties.

Defects like oxygen vacancies in reducible oxides like TiO2 can also modify the electronic structure of supported metal clusters. This can lead to electron-rich metal clusters with enhanced chemical activity.

CO vibrational spectroscopy provides evidence for changes in the electronic structure and charge state of supported metal clusters. Shifts in CO vibrational frequencies indicate changes in the metal's oxidation state or degree of electron richness.

While not discussing substitutional doping specifically, these examples demonstrate how modifying oxide supports can alter the electronic properties of catalysts and potentially enhance their activity. Further research would be needed to determine the specific effects of cation doping on surface chemistry, bonding, and catalytic properties.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。但是,它确实讨论了通过氧化物薄膜厚度和缺陷来修饰负载金属纳米粒子的相关概念。

改变氧化物支撑薄膜的厚度可以诱导自发的电荷转移到负载的金属颗粒上,改变它们的形状和电子性质。这为设计具有可调性能的新型催化材料开辟了可能性。

像TiO2这样的可还原氧化物中的氧空位等缺陷也可以修改负载金属团簇的电子结构。这可以导致电子丰富的金属团簇,增强其化学活性。

CO振动光谱为负载金属团簇电子结构和电荷状态的变化提供了证据。CO振动频率的移动表明金属的氧化态或电子丰富程度发生了变化。

虽然没有具体讨论替代掺杂,但这些例子表明,修改氧化物支撑物可以改变催化剂的电子性质,并可能增强其活性。还需要进一步的研究来确定阳离子掺杂对表面化学、化学键和催化性质的具体影响。
