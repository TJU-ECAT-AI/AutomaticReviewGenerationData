The provided literature does not contain information directly relevant to substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts or its effects on surface chemistry, chemical bonding, catalytic activity, active centers, or industrial reactions. The text focuses on bromine-mediated methane conversion using mercuric oxide supported on Zn-MCM-41, which is a different catalytic system. Without relevant information in the given text, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the question about substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts.

所提供的文献中没有直接涉及金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂或其对表面化学、化学键合、催化活性、活性中心或工业反应的影响的信息。该文本主要关注使用负载在Zn-MCM-41上的氧化汞进行溴介导的甲烷转化，这是一个不同的催化体系。由于给定文本中没有相关信息，我无法对金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂问题提供准确的回答。

[1] "Zn-MCM-41 was prepared as the following method. 1.2 g Zn(OH)2 was dissolved in 9.5 g 25 wt.% ammonia and then the mixture was added into 120 ml aqueous solution of 2.4 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide."

[2] "The involvement of ZnO multiplies the chance of scavenging the bromine from HBr and CBr functionality to yield the oxidized products. The moderate bromine metathesis rate of ZnBr2/ZnO pairs is an important mechanism for holding bromine in the catalyst column and the promoting effects of ZnBr2 upon CH bond bromination may also reduce the leaching of unreacted bromine."

The literature does not directly address how substitutional cation doping modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into how zinc incorporation affects catalytic activity in a bromine-mediated methane conversion process:

1. Zinc is incorporated into the MCM-41 mesoporous silica support, likely modifying its surface properties.

2. The presence of ZnO in the catalyst helps scavenge bromine species and promote CH bond bromination.

3. ZnBr2/ZnO pairs play a role in retaining bromine in the catalyst and enhancing its reactivity.

These effects suggest that zinc incorporation modifies the catalyst surface chemistry and influences the nature of active sites, though the specific impacts on chemical bonding are not detailed. The implications for catalytic activity include improved bromine utilization and enhanced methane activation. However, the document does not provide enough information to draw broad conclusions about substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts for other industrially relevant reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论取代性阳离子掺杂如何改变金属氧化物催化剂的表面化学性质和破坏化学键合。然而，它确实提供了一些关于锌的引入如何影响溴介导的甲烷转化过程中的催化活性的见解：

1. 锌被引入到MCM-41介孔硅支撑体中，可能改变了其表面性质。

2. 催化剂中ZnO的存在有助于捕获溴物种并促进CH键的溴化。

3. ZnBr2/ZnO对在保持催化剂中的溴和增强其反应性方面发挥作用。

这些效果表明，锌的引入改变了催化剂的表面化学性质并影响了活性位点的性质，尽管对化学键合的具体影响并未详细说明。对催化活性的影响包括改善溴的利用和增强甲烷的活化。然而，该文档没有提供足够的信息来对其他工业相关反应中金属氧化物催化剂的取代性阳离子掺杂得出广泛的结论。

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. The document focuses on bromine-mediated methane conversion using zinc-doped MCM-41 supported mercuric oxide catalysts. It does not discuss the effects of substitutional cation doping on surface chemistry, chemical bonding, or catalytic activity enhancement in metal oxide catalysts more broadly. The paper is primarily concerned with investigating the role of bromine in the catalytic cycle for methane conversion to C1 oxygenates, rather than the impacts of cation doping on catalyst properties and performance.
