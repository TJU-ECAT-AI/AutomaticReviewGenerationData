[1] "The addition of certain surface oxide species to oxide supports can dramatically retard the thermal sintering of oxide supports. Interestingly, the effective surface oxide additives tend to be those oxides that possess very high Tammann temperatures and surface oxide additives that exhibit low Tammann temperatures tend to accelerate the sintering of the oxide support"

[2] "These fundamental findings suggest that (1) the sintering process initiates at oxide surfaces, (2) less mobile surface oxide additives retard the sintering process by titrating the surface sites responsible for initiating sintering, and (3) more mobile surface oxide additives enhance the sintering process by accelerating the condensation of surface hydroxyls and/or reactions of oxide defects."

[3] "The dramatic variation in the TOF for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermodynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant."

[4] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can alter the thermal stability of the oxide support by affecting sintering behavior. Less mobile dopants with high Tammann temperatures tend to retard sintering by occupying surface sites, while more mobile dopants accelerate sintering.

2. It changes the electron density distribution, particularly at bridging bonds between the active metal and support. Lower electronegativity dopants increase electron density at these bonds.

3. It modifies reaction kinetics, primarily by changing the rate constant of the rate-determining step rather than adsorption equilibrium constants. 

These modifications have important implications:

- They can enhance catalytic activity by optimizing electron density at active sites to facilitate redox cycles.

- They affect the nature and location of active centers by modifying surface chemistry and stabilizing certain surface structures.

- For industrially relevant reactions like methanol oxidation, careful dopant selection could improve activity and selectivity by tuning the electronic properties of active sites.

- Thermal stability and catalyst lifetime could be improved by using appropriate dopants to retard sintering.

Overall, substitutional doping provides a powerful tool to engineer the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of metal oxide materials at the molecular level. Proper selection of dopants allows optimization of activity, selectivity, and stability for specific reactions and operating conditions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代型阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著修改表面化学性质和化学键合:

1. 它可以通过影响烧结行为来改变氧化物支撑体的热稳定性。具有高塔曼温度的低迁移性掺杂剂倾向于通过占据表面位点来延缓烧结，而更高迁移性的掺杂剂则加速烧结。

2. 它改变了电子密度分布，特别是在活性金属和支撑体之间的桥接键处。电负性较低的掺杂剂会增加这些键处的电子密度。

3. 它修改了反应动力学，主要是通过改变速率决定步骤的速率常数而不是吸附平衡常数。

这些修改有重要的影响:

- 它们可以通过优化活性位点处的电子密度来促进氧化还原循环，从而增强催化活性。

- 它们通过修改表面化学性质和稳定某些表面结构来影响活性中心的性质和位置。

- 对于工业相关反应如甲醇氧化，仔细选择掺杂剂可以通过调节活性位点的电子性质来提高活性和选择性。

- 通过使用适当的掺杂剂来延缓烧结，可以提高热稳定性和催化剂寿命。

总的来说，取代型掺杂提供了一个强大的工具，可以在分子水平上设计金属氧化物材料的表面化学性质和催化性能。适当选择掺杂剂可以针对特定反应和操作条件优化活性、选择性和稳定性。
