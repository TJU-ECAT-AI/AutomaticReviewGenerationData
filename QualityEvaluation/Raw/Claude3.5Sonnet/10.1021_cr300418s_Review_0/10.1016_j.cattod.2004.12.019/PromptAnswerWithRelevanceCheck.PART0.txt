[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxides (supported metal oxides, molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxides) has undergone dramatic paradigm changes over the past 25 years as new characterization techniques became available"

[2] "Application of these spectroscopic techniques to the investigation of mixed metal oxide catalysts have provided new fundamental insights into the electronic and molecular structures of mixed metal oxide catalytic active sites and how they control the catalytic activity and selectivity characteristics."

[3] "The most significant discovery has been that amorphous metal oxide phases are always present and are the catalytic active sites for many applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts."

[4] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[5] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

[1] "The catalytic TOF value for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermodynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant."

[2] "It was found that the thermodynamic equilibrium adsorption constant, Kads, was relatively invariant as the oxide support electronegativity was changed. The kinetic rate constant, krds, however, varied significantly as the oxide support electronegativity was changed."

[3] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[4] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It alters the electronegativity of the support cation, which affects the electron density on bridging bonds between the active metal and support. Lower support cation electronegativity leads to higher electron density on these bonds, enhancing redox cycling rates.

2. It changes the kinetic rate constant (krds) of catalytic reactions, while leaving the thermodynamic adsorption constant (Kads) relatively unchanged. This suggests doping primarily affects reaction kinetics rather than adsorption thermodynamics.

3. Changing support particle size through doping can slightly decrease catalytic turnover frequencies, possibly due to quantum size effects altering electronic properties.

These modifications have important implications:

1. They provide a means to enhance catalytic activity by tuning support electronegativity.

2. They suggest the nature of active centers involves both the metal oxide and support, with bridging bonds playing a key role.

3. They indicate that optimizing particle size and electronic properties, rather than just maximizing surface area, is important for improving catalytic performance.

4. For industrially relevant reactions like selective oxidation, these insights could guide development of more efficient catalysts by focusing on support choice and doping to optimize electronic properties and reaction kinetics.

3. 通过掺杂改变支撑物粒子尺寸可能会略微降低催化转化频率,这可能是由于量子尺寸效应改变了电子性质。

这些修饰有重要意义:

1. 它们提供了一种通过调整支撑物电负性来增强催化活性的方法。

2. 它们表明活性中心的性质涉及金属氧化物和支撑物,其中桥接键起着关键作用。

3. 它们表明优化粒子尺寸和电子性质,而不仅仅是最大化表面积,对于提高催化性能很重要。

[2] "Consequently, fundamental knowledge about the catalytic events at exposed catalytic active sites, on solid surfaces in contact with either gas or liquid phases, is critical to understanding catalytic events."

[3] "The catalytic TOF value for the surface vanadia species is not affected by the presence of the acidic surface WOx species"

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can create amorphous metal oxide phases at the surface, which often serve as the catalytic active sites.

2. It alters the electronic properties of surface species. For example, less electronegative support cations increase electron density on bridging bonds, enhancing redox activity.

3. It can stabilize or destabilize oxygen species. Basic additives like KOx make oxygen less reducible when interacting with surface species.

4. It can introduce new functionalities without necessarily changing the activity of existing sites. For instance, adding acidic WOx does not affect vanadia redox activity but provides new acid sites.

The implications are:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity through tuning of electronic properties and oxygen lability. 

2. New types of active centers can be created while preserving existing ones.

3. The nature and location of active sites shifts from bulk to surface amorphous phases.

4. Potential for improving industrially relevant reactions by rationally designing surface compositions and properties.

5. The need to focus on characterizing and understanding surface species rather than just bulk properties when developing catalysts.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can alter the electron density on bridging metal-oxygen-support bonds, affecting the redox properties of active sites. Lower electronegativity dopants tend to increase electron density and enhance redox activity.

2. Doping can change the size and structure of metal oxide particles, which can impact catalytic activity. Smaller particle sizes were found to slightly decrease activity in some cases.

3. The addition of secondary metal oxides as dopants does not necessarily change the intrinsic redox chemistry of the primary active sites. However, they can act as promoters for certain reactions by providing additional functionalities (e.g. acidity) needed for specific reaction mechanisms.

4. Doping allows tuning of the electronic and molecular structures of the active sites, providing a way to control catalytic activity and selectivity.

The implications for catalysis include:

- Ability to enhance activity by rational selection of dopants to optimize electron density at active sites
- Potential to improve selectivity by incorporating promoters that facilitate desired reaction pathways  
- New active centers may be created at the interface between doped species
- Industrial reactions could be improved through careful engineering of doped catalysts with optimized compositions

However, the effects are complex and highly dependent on the specific catalyst system and reaction. Detailed characterization is needed to elucidate the nature and location of active sites in doped catalysts.

[1] "The addition of certain surface oxide species to oxide supports can dramatically retard the thermal sintering of oxide supports. Interestingly, the effective surface oxide additives tend to be those oxides that possess very high Tammann temperatures and surface oxide additives that exhibit low Tammann temperatures tend to accelerate the sintering of the oxide support"

[2] "These fundamental findings suggest that (1) the sintering process initiates at oxide surfaces, (2) less mobile surface oxide additives retard the sintering process by titrating the surface sites responsible for initiating sintering, and (3) more mobile surface oxide additives enhance the sintering process by accelerating the condensation of surface hydroxyls and/or reactions of oxide defects."

[3] "The dramatic variation in the TOF for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermodynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant."

[4] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

</quotes>

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can alter the thermal stability of the oxide support by affecting sintering behavior. Less mobile dopants with high Tammann temperatures tend to retard sintering by occupying surface sites, while more mobile dopants accelerate sintering.

2. It changes the electron density distribution, particularly at bridging bonds between the active metal and support. Lower electronegativity dopants increase electron density at these bonds.

3. It modifies reaction kinetics, primarily by changing the rate constant of the rate-determining step rather than adsorption equilibrium constants. 

These modifications have important implications:

- They can enhance catalytic activity by optimizing electron density at active sites to facilitate redox cycles.

- They affect the nature and location of active centers by modifying surface chemistry and stabilizing certain surface structures.

- For industrially relevant reactions like methanol oxidation, careful dopant selection could improve activity and selectivity by tuning the electronic properties of active sites.

- Thermal stability and catalyst lifetime could be improved by using appropriate dopants to retard sintering.

Overall, substitutional doping provides a powerful tool to engineer the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of metal oxide materials at the molecular level. Proper selection of dopants allows optimization of activity, selectivity, and stability for specific reactions and operating conditions.
