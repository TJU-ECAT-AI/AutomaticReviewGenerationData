[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxides (supported metal oxides, molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxides) has undergone dramatic paradigm changes over the past 25 years as new characterization techniques became available"

[2] "Application of these spectroscopic techniques to the investigation of mixed metal oxide catalysts have provided new fundamental insights into the electronic and molecular structures of mixed metal oxide catalytic active sites and how they control the catalytic activity and selectivity characteristics."

[3] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[4] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

[5] "These fundamental studies revealed that (1) the surface VO4 species supported on TiO2 possess the same redox surface chemistry in the presence and absence of secondary acidic surface metal oxide promoters, and (2) the secondary surface metal oxide additive only becomes a promoter depending on the special chemical requirements of a given catalytic reaction."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can alter the electron density on bridging metal-oxygen-support bonds, affecting the redox properties of active sites. Lower electronegativity dopants tend to increase electron density and enhance redox activity.

2. Doping can change the size and structure of metal oxide particles, which can impact catalytic activity. Smaller particle sizes were found to slightly decrease activity in some cases.

3. The addition of secondary metal oxides as dopants does not necessarily change the intrinsic redox chemistry of the primary active sites. However, they can act as promoters for certain reactions by providing additional functionalities (e.g. acidity) needed for specific reaction mechanisms.

4. Doping allows tuning of the electronic and molecular structures of the active sites, providing a way to control catalytic activity and selectivity.

The implications for catalysis include:

- Ability to enhance activity by rational selection of dopants to optimize electron density at active sites
- Potential to improve selectivity by incorporating promoters that facilitate desired reaction pathways  
- New active centers may be created at the interface between doped species
- Industrial reactions could be improved through careful engineering of doped catalysts with optimized compositions

However, the effects are complex and highly dependent on the specific catalyst system and reaction. Detailed characterization is needed to elucidate the nature and location of active sites in doped catalysts.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式修改表面化学性质并影响化学键合：

1. 它可以改变金属-氧-支持物桥键上的电子密度，影响活性位点的氧化还原性质。电负性较低的掺杂剂往往会增加电子密度并增强氧化还原活性。

2. 掺杂可以改变金属氧化物颗粒的大小和结构，这可能会影响催化活性。在某些情况下，较小的颗粒尺寸会略微降低活性。

3. 作为掺杂剂添加的次要金属氧化物不一定会改变主要活性位点的固有氧化还原化学性质。但是，它们可以通过提供特定反应机制所需的额外功能（如酸性）来充当某些反应的促进剂。

4. 掺杂允许调节活性位点的电子和分子结构，提供了一种控制催化活性和选择性的方法。

对催化作用的影响包括：

- 通过合理选择掺杂剂来优化活性位点的电子密度，从而提高活性的能力
- 通过引入促进所需反应途径的促进剂来提高选择性的潜力
- 可能在掺杂物种之间的界面处创建新的活性中心
- 通过仔细设计具有优化组成的掺杂催化剂，可以改进工业反应

然而，这些效果是复杂的，高度依赖于特定的催化剂系统和反应。需要详细的表征来阐明掺杂催化剂中活性位点的性质和位置。
