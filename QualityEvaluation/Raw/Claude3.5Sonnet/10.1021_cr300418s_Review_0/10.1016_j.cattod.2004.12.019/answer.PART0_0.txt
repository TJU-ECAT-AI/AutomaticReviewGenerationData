[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxides (supported metal oxides, molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxides) has undergone dramatic paradigm changes over the past 25 years as new characterization techniques became available"

[2] "Application of these spectroscopic techniques to the investigation of mixed metal oxide catalysts have provided new fundamental insights into the electronic and molecular structures of mixed metal oxide catalytic active sites and how they control the catalytic activity and selectivity characteristics."

[3] "The most significant discovery has been that amorphous metal oxide phases are always present and are the catalytic active sites for many applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts."

[4] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[5] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can alter the electron density and electronegativity of metal-oxygen bonds at the surface, impacting redox properties and reaction rates. 

2. Dopant cations can create new types of surface sites with different coordination environments and catalytic properties.

3. Doping can introduce structural defects and oxygen vacancies that may serve as active centers.

4. It can modify the acid-base properties of the surface.

The implications for catalytic activity enhancement include:

1. Potential for tuning redox properties and reaction rates by selecting appropriate dopants.

2. Creation of new active sites with unique catalytic functions.

3. Possible stabilization of reactive surface species.

4. Modification of selectivity by altering surface acidity/basicity.

The nature and location of active centers can be affected by:

1. Formation of isolated dopant sites or clusters at the surface.

2. Changes in metal oxidation states and coordination.

3. Generation of oxygen vacancies or other defect sites.

4. Alterations to surface terminations and exposed crystal facets.

Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions may include:

1. Enhanced rates for oxidation/reduction reactions.

2. Improved selectivity in partial oxidation processes.

3. Increased stability and lifetime of catalysts.

4. New catalytic functions enabled by unique dopant-host interactions.

However, the effects are highly dependent on the specific dopant-host system and reaction conditions. Careful characterization and testing is required to elucidate the impacts in each case.
