[1] "The catalytic TOF value for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermodynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant."

[2] "It was found that the thermodynamic equilibrium adsorption constant, Kads, was relatively invariant as the oxide support electronegativity was changed. The kinetic rate constant, krds, however, varied significantly as the oxide support electronegativity was changed."

[3] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

[4] "The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It alters the electronegativity of the support cation, which affects the electron density on bridging bonds between the active metal and support. Lower support cation electronegativity leads to higher electron density on these bonds, enhancing redox cycling rates.

2. It changes the kinetic rate constant (krds) of catalytic reactions, while leaving the thermodynamic adsorption constant (Kads) relatively unchanged. This suggests doping primarily affects reaction kinetics rather than adsorption thermodynamics.

3. Changing support particle size through doping can slightly decrease catalytic turnover frequencies, possibly due to quantum size effects altering electronic properties.

These modifications have important implications:

1. They provide a means to enhance catalytic activity by tuning support electronegativity.

2. They suggest the nature of active centers involves both the metal oxide and support, with bridging bonds playing a key role.

3. They indicate that optimizing particle size and electronic properties, rather than just maximizing surface area, is important for improving catalytic performance.

4. For industrially relevant reactions like selective oxidation, these insights could guide development of more efficient catalysts by focusing on support choice and doping to optimize electronic properties and reaction kinetics.

金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式修改表面化学性质和破坏化学键合:

1. 它改变了支撑阳离子的电负性,这影响了活性金属和支撑物之间桥接键的电子密度。支撑阳离子电负性较低会导致这些键上的电子密度更高,从而增强氧化还原循环速率。

2. 它改变了催化反应的动力学速率常数(krds),同时保持热力学吸附常数(Kads)相对不变。这表明掺杂主要影响反应动力学而非吸附热力学。

3. 通过掺杂改变支撑物粒子尺寸可能会略微降低催化转化频率,这可能是由于量子尺寸效应改变了电子性质。

这些修饰有重要意义:

1. 它们提供了一种通过调整支撑物电负性来增强催化活性的方法。

2. 它们表明活性中心的性质涉及金属氧化物和支撑物,其中桥接键起着关键作用。

3. 它们表明优化粒子尺寸和电子性质,而不仅仅是最大化表面积,对于提高催化性能很重要。

4. 对于工业相关反应如选择性氧化,这些见解可以通过关注支撑物选择和掺杂来优化电子性质和反应动力学,从而指导开发更高效的催化剂。
