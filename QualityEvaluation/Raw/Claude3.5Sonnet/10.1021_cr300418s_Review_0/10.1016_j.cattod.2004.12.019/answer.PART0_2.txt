[1] "The most significant discovery has been that amorphous metal oxide phases are always present and are the catalytic active sites for many applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts."

[2] "Consequently, fundamental knowledge about the catalytic events at exposed catalytic active sites, on solid surfaces in contact with either gas or liquid phases, is critical to understanding catalytic events."

[3] "The catalytic TOF value for the surface vanadia species is not affected by the presence of the acidic surface WOx species"

[4] "The direct interaction of the basic surface KOx species with the surface VO4 species results in more stable and less reducible oxygen species"

[5] "This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site"

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can create amorphous metal oxide phases at the surface, which often serve as the catalytic active sites.

2. It alters the electronic properties of surface species. For example, less electronegative support cations increase electron density on bridging bonds, enhancing redox activity.

3. It can stabilize or destabilize oxygen species. Basic additives like KOx make oxygen less reducible when interacting with surface species.

4. It can introduce new functionalities without necessarily changing the activity of existing sites. For instance, adding acidic WOx does not affect vanadia redox activity but provides new acid sites.

The implications are:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity through tuning of electronic properties and oxygen lability. 

2. New types of active centers can be created while preserving existing ones.

3. The nature and location of active sites shifts from bulk to surface amorphous phases.

4. Potential for improving industrially relevant reactions by rationally designing surface compositions and properties.

5. The need to focus on characterizing and understanding surface species rather than just bulk properties when developing catalysts.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式修改表面化学性质并破坏化学键合:

1. 它可以在表面创建非晶态金属氧化物相,这些相通常作为催化活性位点。

2. 它改变了表面物种的电子性质。例如,电负性较低的支撑阳离子会增加桥键上的电子密度,从而增强氧化还原活性。

3. 它可以稳定或不稳定氧物种。像KOx这样的碱性添加剂在与表面物种相互作用时会使氧更难被还原。

4. 它可以引入新的功能而不一定改变现有位点的活性。例如,添加酸性WOx不会影响钒的氧化还原活性,但会提供新的酸性位点。

这些影响包括:

1. 通过调节电子性质和氧的活动性来增强催化活性。

2. 可以创建新类型的活性中心,同时保留现有的活性中心。

3. 活性位点的性质和位置从体相转移到表面非晶相。

4. 通过合理设计表面组成和性质,有可能改进工业相关反应。

5. 在开发催化剂时,需要关注表面物种的表征和理解,而不仅仅是体相性质。
