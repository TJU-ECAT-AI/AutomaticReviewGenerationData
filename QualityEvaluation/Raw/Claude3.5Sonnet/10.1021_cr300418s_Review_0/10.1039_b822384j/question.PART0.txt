The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde on well-ordered thin V2O5(001) films
supported on Au(111) was studied. Temperature-programmed desorption shows that
bulk-terminated surfaces are not reactive, whereas reduced surfaces produce formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde desorption occurs between 400 K and 550 K, without evidence for reaction
products other than formaldehyde and water. Scanning tunnelling microscopy shows that
methanol forms methoxy groups on vanadyl oxygen vacancies. If methanol is adsorbed at low
temperature, the available adsorption sites are only partly covered with methoxy groups after
warming up to room temperature, whereas prolonged methanol dosing at room temperature leads
to full coverage. In order to explain these findings we present a model that essentially comprises
recombination of methoxy and hydrogen to methanol in competition with the reaction of two
surface hydroxyl groups to form water.
1.
Introduction
The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is regarded as
a prototype reaction for the oxidative dehydrogenation of organic
molecules. Vanadium oxides, often supported on other oxides,
form an important class of catalysts for partial oxidation
reactions.1,2 The activity of vanadia oxidation catalysts is strongly
dependent on the metal oxide support.1,3 Since supported oxides
are complex systems, detailed understanding of the reaction
processes and atomistic mechanisms on these systems is hard to
achieve. Studies of simpler systems, such as vanadium oxide single
crystals or well-ordered thin films can help to elucidate some of
these aspects. Previous studies in this direction include methanol
adsorption on sub-monolayer to multilayer vanadia layers on
TiO2(110)4,5 and CeO2(111).6,7 For vanadia on TiO2(110) it was
shown that (sub)-monolayers of vanadia are active, whereas
multilayers of vanadia are inactive.5 This was attributed to the
involvement of MOV bonds (where M denotes the metal
atom of the supporting metal oxide) in the partial oxidation
reaction. Theoretical studies for the conversion of methanol to
formaldehyde are presented in ref. 8 and 9.
A frequently found intermediate is methoxy, which is
produced via fission of the OH bond of the methanol mole-
cules resulting in methoxy groups and hydrogen atoms.3,5 The
final step for the formation of formaldehyde is hydrogen
abstraction from the surface methoxy groups which occurs
at elevated temperature. Thus, two hydrogen atoms are
abstracted from the methanol molecule in the course of the
formaldehyde production. These may react to form water,
which leads to a net reaction CH3OH + O - CH2O + H2O.
Since this reaction consumes oxygen, the oxidic substrate will
be reduced if oxygen is not replenished from the gas phase.
Recently, we have shown that well-ordered V2O5(001) films
can be grown on Au(111).10,11 In this paper we present results of
an investigation of the reactivity of nearly defect free and slightly
oxygen-deficient V2O5(001) surfaces towards methanol oxida-
tion. Reduced surfaces were prepared by electron irradiation,
which mainly removes vanadyl oxygen atoms and results in
preferential reduction of the surface. Reduction by thermal
annealing was not used in the current case since defects tend to
agglomerate upon annealing and a quantitatively well defined
degree of reduction is harder to achieve. Furthermore, annealing
leads to migration of oxygen to the surface, such that the bulk
will become more reduced than the surface.11,12 The effect of
reduction by annealing is described in ref. 13 for a V2O5(001)
single crystal surface and in ref. 11 for V2O5(001) on Au(111).
The

temperature-programmed desorption (TPD).
This paper is organised as follows: after a description of the
experimental and theoretical details in section 2, the results are
presented and discussed in section 3. Based on a combination of
results from the different techniques that were employed, an
adsorption model is developed which is presented and compared
with experimental results and theory in sections 3.5 and 3.6.
Conclusions follow in section 4.

with a base pressure below 1  1010 mbar. This system
incorporates a commercially available STM14,15 in which
etched tungsten tips were used. TPD experiments were carried
out with a differentially pumped quadrupole mass spectro-
meter (QMS)16 equipped with a Feulner cup,17 in order to
reduce the influence of the background pressure on the
spectra. For all spectra, a heating rate of 0.5 K s1 was used.
Methanol (CH3OH, pro analysis, Merck) was cleaned by
numerous freezepumpthaw cycles and dosed onto the
surface with a gas doser that preferentially exposes the sample
surface to gases, thereby maintaining a low background
pressure in the UHV system. High-resolution XPS spectra
were measured with a Scienta R4000 electron energy analyser
in a UHV chamber connected to the UE52-PGM beam line of
the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY (Berlin, Germany).

films was realised by electron bombardment with a hot
filament facing the sample surface. The electron energy was
set to 50 eV by applying a bias voltage to the sample.
Calculations are based on spin DFT and employ a plane wave
basis set (400 eV cutoff) as implemented in the VASP code with
the PBE functional.18 The defective (3  1) V2O5(001) surface
was modelled using a two-layer slab and a (2  2  1) k-mesh.

Results and discussion
3.1
Temperature-programmed desorption
Fig. 1 shows a TPD spectrum of methanol on an as-prepared,
nearly defect-free bulk-terminated V2O5 film. Only molecular
methanol was found in the desorbing products. The most
intense peaks in the cracking pattern of methanol are masses
29 and 31, which have an intensity ratio of about 2 to 1. The
absence of desorbing gases other than methanol indicates that
the defect-free surface is not active for reactions of methanol.
Reactive surfaces can be obtained by removing vanadyl
oxygen with the aid of electron irradiation. On films reduced
in this way formaldehyde is produced, as indicated by the
presence of a desorption signal in the mass 29 spectrum (29 is
the most abundant mass in the mass cracking pattern of
formaldehyde19) without corresponding intensity at mass 31.
Fig. 2 compares TPD spectra (mass 29) obtained after dosing
5 L of CH3OH at 100 K (1 L = 1.33  106 mbar s) onto
surfaces reduced with different electron doses. For low
electron doses, formaldehyde desorption takes place at about
510 K, whereas for an electron dose of 3 mC an additional
broad desorption peak centred around 450 K arises, which
dominates for doses of 5 mC and more. According to
STM results (not shown here) the vanadyl double rows
(as present on regular V2O5(001)) can hardly be recognised
any more for this electron dose. For all TPD spectra the
masses corresponding to H2, H2O, CO, CO2 and CH4 were
also recorded, but no evidence for the desorption of species
other than methanol, formaldehyde and water was found. In
addition, STM images recorded after TPD did not show any
structures indicative of the presence of species remaining on
the surface. The absence of detectable CO and CO2 amounts
indicates that formate formation did not take place since CO

and CO2 are common formate combustion products. The
temperature window for formaldehyde desorption is similar
to that found for well-ordered V2O3(0001) films on Au(111)20
and supported vanadium oxide layers and clusters,47,21 which
may be related to similar mechanisms for hydrogen abstraction.
Our finding that non-reduced, vanadyl-terminated films are
not reactive for methanol oxidation is in line with previous
results for non-reduced V2O3 films that are also terminated
with vanadyl groups.11 Furthermore, also non-reduced multi-
layers of vanadium oxide on TiO2(110) were found to be not
reactive.5
3.2
STM statistics
Fig. 3(a) shows a STM image of a V2O5(001) film, which was
reduced by exposure to an electron dose of 3 mC. Missing
vanadyl oxygen atoms are imaged as depressions (dark colour)
as discussed in ref. 11. These defects, created by electron
bombardment, act as adsorption sites for methoxy groups,
visible as bright blobs after exposure to methanol (b). The
STM images show that not all defects are covered. A flash to
560 K removes the methoxy groups and image (c) is observed.
The density of surface defects is reduced to about 0.6 times the
defect density after reduction (a) and a large fraction of the
remaining defects have coalesced. These effects are probably
mainly caused by migration of oxygen from deeper layers to
the surface at elevated temperature11,12 and defect migration in
the surface plane. Because of this, it is not possible to
investigate whether the formaldehyde production leaves addi-
tional defects in the V2O5 layer due to oxygen consumption. In
Fig. 4, we summarise an analysis of the number of defects after
reduction and the number of methoxy groups and remaining
defects after subsequent methanol exposure, as obtained from
STM data. For each stage, at least 3 STM images of different
areas on the sample were analysed and the number of defects
and adsorbates is expressed as percentage of the number of
vanadyl sites on a non-reduced surface. Different types of
defects were distinguished (labelled with characters AE,
see Fig. 4), namely single (isolated) vanadyl oxygen vacancies
(A), vanadyl pair vacancies (two oxygen atoms of a vanadyl
pair perpendicular to a vanadyl double row both removed, B)
and multiple vacancies along a row (CE). Fig. 4 shows that
the density of all types of defects except type B decreases upon
methanol adsorption. The decrease is easily understood in
view of the formation of surface methoxy groups but for the
increase of the number of type B defects another mechanism
must be responsible, which will be discussed at a later point.
The STM analysis also shows that for a methanol dose of 10 L
the reactive vacancies are only partially covered.
The data displayed in Fig. 4 have been obtained from
moderately reduced surfaces where the vanadyl double rows
are still easily recognisable. Fig. 2 shows that the formaldehyde
production drops rapidly if the electron dose is increased
further so that the maximum amount of formaldehyde formed
on V2O5(001) films is smaller by about an order of magnitude
than the amount formed on V2O3(0001) films.20 We can only
speculate what the reasons for this result could be. The STM
results suggest that B type defects cannot chemisorb methoxy.
Since larger electron doses produce more B type defects, this
can partly explain the decrease in reactivity. As has been
shown for V2O5(001) single crystals13 and thin films,11
reduction may lead to V6O13(001) type structures. We did
not yet investigate the reactivity of V6O13(001) towards

methanol oxidation but it may well be the case that this type of
surface in inactive.
3.3
Synchrotron XPS
One could imagine two reasons for the partial coverage of the
reactive oxygen vacancies. First, it might be that two types of
isolated defects exist that are indistinguishable in STM but of
which only one can chemisorb methoxy. A second explanation
is that a part of the methoxy groups can recombine with
hydroxyl groups below room temperature, forming molecular
methanol that leaves the surface. This will also result in a
partial coverage of the defects at room temperature as
observed in the STM experiments. The TPD spectra of
methanol on reduced V2O5 indeed show a methanol peak in
the temperature range 230 K to 300 K (see Fig. 5, black lines,
label LT), which could result from such a recombination
process. XPS was utilised to show that the methanol
desorption peak can in fact be attributed to a recombination
reaction and not to desorption of molecularly adsorbed
methanol. Fig. 6 shows a set of C 1s spectra recorded at
100 K sample temperature under highly surface sensitive
conditions: the photoelectron take offangle was set to 701
with respect to the surface normal and the photon energy was
set to 380 eV. The latter value gives a kinetic energy of the C 1s
electrons of about 100 eV, which is an energy where the
inelastic mean free path length is small. The as-prepared film
shows a C 1s peak at 283.8 eV, which is related to a carbon
contamination of the film. This contamination is due to
carbon incorporation into the film occurring during the
evaporation of metallic vanadium onto the substrate which
is the first step of the oxide film preparation. The metallic
vanadium may dissociate CO molecules from the residual gas
atmosphere, which would contaminate the thickening film
with carbon.
After reduction and methanol adsorption, the sample was
flashed to 230 K in order to desorb the molecularly adsorbed
methanol. In the corresponding C 1s spectrum a large peak at
286.2 eV binding energy is found, which is attributed to
methoxy
groups.
A
smaller
contribution
of
molecular
methanol at 288.0 eV is also found which we assign at least
partly to be due to adsorption of methanol from the residual
gas
atmosphere
(for
methanol
on
V2O3(0001)20
and
CeO2(111)26 binding energies also near to 288 eV were found).
In the XPS chamber a less effective dosing system was used,
therefore
a
slight
contamination
of
the
residual
gas
atmosphere with methanol could not be avoided.
The binding energies found for methoxy and methanol
compare well to other reports in the literature2226 with the
remark that the reported binding energies vary somewhat
depending on the substrate (see ref. 26 and references therein).
Flashing to 350 K clearly results in a loss of methoxy, whereas
the amount of molecular methanol remains approximately
constant. After flashing to 525 K most of the methoxy has
left the surface to produce formaldehyde. Thus, the XPS
results clearly show that the methanol desorption peak
between 230 K to 300 K in Fig. 5 is due to a recombination
of methoxy and hydroxyl groups to methanol followed by
desorption. This process frees part of the defects covered with
methoxy groups and leads to the observed partial coverage at
room temperature. Based on these results we exclude that two
types of single defects exist, of which only one type is reactive.
Of course, this discussion currently leaves open the question
why only a part and not all of the methoxy groups transform
into methanol via recombination with hydrogen from the
hydroxyl groups. This issue will be discussed in the following.

Methanol adsorption at room temperature
Nearly full methoxy coverage of the reactive oxygen vacancies
can be achieved by dosing a relatively large amount of

methanol at room temperature (RT). The right column in
Fig. 4 shows that for a methanol dose of 200 L at RT
practically all reactive defects are covered, whereas this is
not the case for a dose of 10 L. The larger methoxy coverage
obtained by a large dose at RT also results in the production
of more formaldehyde, as shown in Fig. 7(a). For the TPD
spectrum of 5 L methanol dosed at 100 K, the surface was
reduced at RT and cooled to 100 K, followed by methanol
dosing. Subsequently the TPD experiment was started. For the
spectra with a 200 L dose at RT, the surface was also reduced
at RT, followed by the exposure to 200 L methanol.
Subsequently the sample was cooled to 100 K and an
additional exposure to 5 L methanol was performed. This
procedure guarantees that the TPD spectra have similar back-
grounds (resulting from the desorption of the methanol
multilayer) such that the data can easily be compared.
Fig. 7(a) shows clearly that a dose of 200 L methanol at RT,
leading to a nearly full coverage of the reactive defects
according to STM, results in a 2 to 3 times larger formaldehyde
yield than a dose of 5 L at 100 K. This factor favourably
compares to the XPS data of Fig. 6, which show that the
methoxy coverage after flashing to 230 K is B2 times larger
than the methoxy coverage after flashing to 350 K. This
indicates that up to 230 K the available adsorption sites are
nearly fully covered with methoxy groups.
Fig. 7(b) (square solid markers) shows the formaldehyde
production as a function of the methanol dose at room
temperature for a surface reduced with an electron dose of
1 mC. The methanol dose was varied by means of the exposure
time, with a fixed dosing rate of 0.38 L s1. The dependence
shows that the limited coverage for lower doses cannot simply
be the result of a sticking coefficient below unity, but results
from a more complex adsorption process: already for low
doses a significant coverage is reached, whereas a further
increase in the coverage only proceeds very slowly with
increasing dose. The solid (red) line in the plot represents the
best fit of the formaldehyde yield versus dose that could be
obtained for the case of a sticking coefficient proportional to
the number of free adsorption sites. It is obvious that the
experimental behaviour cannot be explained when only a
coverage-dependent sticking coefficient is taken into account.
3.5
Model for methanol adsorption on V2O5(001)
We explain the observed adsorption behaviour at RT in terms
of the suggested methoxy-hydroxyl recombination. When a
methanol molecule adsorbs on a defect, it forms a methoxy
and a hydroxyl group, similar to the situation on V2O3(0001).8
V + VO + CH3OH - CH3OV + VOH
(1)
where V denotes a defect site, VO a vanadyl group, VOH a
hydroxyl group and CH3OV a methoxy group. Parts of the
methoxy and hydroxyl groups recombine, forming molecular
methanol, which can desorb from the surface and leave
uncovered defects. This is in agreement with results of
Burcham and Wachs27 who reported that the dissociative
chemisorption of methanol on supported V2O5 is reversible.
However, it is obvious that the adsorption process in the
current case is not fully reversible since a part of the methoxy
groups stays on the surface even at room temperature and
forms formaldehyde upon further heating to B500 K. The
question to be discussed now is which factor determines the
number of methoxy groups staying on the surface and
the number, which forms methanol with hydrogen from the
hydroxyl groups. This factor is probably the number of
hydroxyl groups on the surface. These can react with methoxy
groups to form methanol but they can also react with other
hydroxyl groups to form water. If the latter process occurs, the
number of hydroxyl groups on the surface will become smaller
than the number of methoxy groups. As a result, not all
methoxy groups can react with hydrogen to form methanol
and a part stays on the surface, finally being transformed into
formaldehyde at elevated temperature. In the following, we
will put together arguments substantiating this assumption.

surface reduction is given in mC followed by methanol dose and

dose at room temperature (solid squares) and formaldehyde peak area

the best fit to the RT data assuming a sticking coefficient that is
proportional to the number of free adsorption sites and ignoring
methanolhydroxyl recombination. The open circles (connected with
a dashed line to guide the eye) indicate the modelled methoxy coverage
using a model that includes simultaneous recombination of methoxy
and OH towards methanol and combination of OH to form water.

It has already been discussed that low temperature adsorp-
tion of methanol leads to a partial coverage of the available
adsorption sites after annealing up to room temperature. This
agrees well with the model presented above if we assume that
the water is formed during warming up at some temperature
below room temperature via a combination reaction of a part
of the hydroxyl groups. Another part of the hydroxyl groups
reacts
with
methoxy
groups,
forming
methanol.
Both
processes produce uncovered adsorption sites according to:
VOH + VOH - VO + V + H2O (water formation) (2)
VOH + CH3OV - VO + V + CH3OH
(methanol formation)
(3)
Assuming that molecularly adsorbed methanol is not available
to react with free adsorption sites at the temperature where
these reactions occur, uncovered adsorption sites as well as
methoxy groups are to be expected at RT, which is in agree-
ment with the STM observations. The TDS data presented in
Fig. 5 show that methanol formation occurs between 230 K
and 300 K, which is supported by the XPS data shown in
Fig. 6. There is no equally clear evidence for the formation of
water. TPD spectra of water on reduced V2O5 (not shown
here) suggest that a part of the hydroxyl groups formed by
water dissociation on defects combines to form water below
room temperature, whereas another part stays on the surface
up to 425 K. The latter observation is supported by room
temperature STM experiments, since the hydroxyl groups that
are stable up to RT could be imaged. Studies of water
adsorption on reduced V2O3(0001) give a similar result in that
water formation via reaction of hydroxyl groups was observed
below room temperature but also desorption states above
room temperature were found.28 In the case of methanol
adsorbed on reduced V2O3(0001) at low temperature, the
reaction of hydroxyl groups to form water could clearly be
detected at B250 K.20 No evidence for the presence of
hydroxyl groups on methoxy covered V2O5(001) surfaces
was found with STM, which supports our suggestion that all
or most hydroxyl groups combine below room temperature.
However, we note that hydroxyl cannot easily be identified
because of the small height contrast of a hydroxyl group
(typically 0.2 A
 ) relative to a methoxy group (typically
1.5 A
 ). Also in the XPS experiments the hydroxyls could not
be observed. This is probably related to the low coverage, in
combination with the relatively small difference in binding
energy between oxygen in hydroxyl (531.3 eV, according to28
and oxygen in V2O5 (529.9 eV). A weak signature of water
formation below room temperature is found in the TPD
spectrum of 5 L methanol on mildly reduced V2O5 (black
lines, label LT in Fig. 5) which shows a tiny peak in the mass
18 signal in the temperature range between 230 K and RT. We
note, however, that this observation is not an irrefutable proof
of water formation on the surface, since in this temperature
range also methanol desorption occurs. TPD spectra of
molecular methanol always show a mass 18 signal when
methanol (mass 29 and 31) is detected, which is presumably
due to an exchange reaction at the walls of the mass
spectrometer housing.
The TPD and STM experiments show that the number of
unoccupied defect sites decreases with increasing methanol
exposure time at room temperature. This effect is due to the
reaction of hydroxyl groups to form water and the recombina-
tion of methoxy and hydroxyl to form methanol while the
surface is dosed with methanol. Thus, unoccupied defects
produced by the water and methanol formation reactions
can react again with methanol to form methoxy and hydroxyl.
Since water desorbs but is not supplied from the gas phase this
process leads to a decrease of the density of hydroxyl groups
such that the hydroxyl coverage ultimately approaches zero
for a large exposure time. As a result, the recombination
reaction terminates and a full coverage of the reactive defects
is achieved.
When 200 L methanol is dosed on the reduced surface at
RT, followed by 5 L at 100 K, the methanol desorption signal
between 230 K and RT almost completely vanishes, as shown
by the red lines (label RT + LT) in Fig. 5. This fits to our
adsorption model: the large dose at RT covers practically all
available adsorption sites with methoxy. Consequently, only
the methanol peaks from molecularly adsorbed methanol are
observed in the temperature range from 120 to 200 K, whereas
the desorption signals of methanol (and possibly water)
between 230 K and RT have almost completely vanished.
The reaction of hydroxyl groups to form water produces
additional surface defects. This is probably the reason for the
increase of the density of type B defects (vanadyl oxygen
vacancy pairs perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows) after
methanol dosing, as observed in the STM statistics results
(Fig. 4). We assume that the reaction of two hydroxyl groups
is facilitated near a single vacancy, such that a vanadyl pair
vacancy remains after hydroxyl combination. Of course, this
remains speculation without additional evidence.
3.6
Energy barriers for (re)combination reactions
We will now assess whether the model with simultaneous
methoxyhydroxyl
recombination
and
hydroxylhydroxyl
combination can explain the dependence of the formaldehyde
production on the methanol dose at room temperature
(Fig. 7(b)). The adsorption process can be described by a set
of two differential equations for the change in methoxy
coverage yM and OH coverage yOH with time t:

and time, n the attempt frequency (1013 s1), E1 and E2 the
energy barriers for methoxyOH recombination and OH
combination, respectively, k Boltzmanns constant and T the
adsorption temperature (RT = 298 K). This model assumes
that both reactions follow a unique reaction path and the
effect of surface diffusion is neglected. In view of the low defect

density, diffusion surely plays a role but if this is much faster
than the water and methanol formation reactions its influence
will be negligible. We assume a coverage-dependent sticking
coefficient of the form:
Sy  N0  NM
Ntot
;
6
with N0 the number of possible adsorption sites per unit
area and NM the number of methoxy groups per unit area
(NM = yMNtot). This equation assumes that methanol mole-
cules that hit the surface at an unoccupied defect site do stick,
whereas molecules that hit a non-reduced or occupied surface
site do not react. However, the accurate expression for the
sticking coefficient is not a critical ingredient for our experi-
mental conditions, since the rate at which methanol molecules
hit the surface is three orders of magnitude higher than the
calculated desorption rate of water and methanol formation.
In this case, the reactive defects are always nearly fully covered
while methanol is dosed.
As the set of differential equations is non-linear, an
analytical solution probably does not exist. Therefore, we
numerically solved the equations using the Mathematica
program package.29 The calculation was broken up into two
steps; the first one modelled the processes on the surface
during the time while methanol was dosed and the second
one modelled the reactions on the surface after the methanol
supply from the gas phase was switched off. In the first step we
calculated the methoxy and OH coverage versus time starting
from zero coverage at t = 0. The value of N0 was taken to be
7.5% of Ntot, according to the density of single (type A) defects
on a surface reduced with an electron dose of 1 mC (see Fig. 4).
Since also defect types C, D and E can adsorb methoxy, this
value of N0 is not fully correct. However, close inspection of
the STM results shows that for a mild reduction with an
electron dose of 1 mC about 90% of the methoxy coverage can
be
attributed
to
adsorption
on
single
defects.
If
the
calculations are performed with a higher density of defects
in order to include row defects, the influence on the calculated
adsorption behaviour is only in the order of 1%, a small
error in view of the spread in the experimental data points.
Furthermore it is not known if the energetics of the
(re)combination reactions is equal for methoxy groups on
single and multiple defects, such that the simplification is
justified. The methanol flux from the gas phase FM was set
to 1.35  1018 molecules m2 s1 (dosing rate 0.38 L s1). The
calculation was stopped when t reached the end of the dosing
period. With the coverages obtained at the end of step 1 and
FM set to zero the second step was started. The calculation was
stopped when the hydroxyl coverage yOH was near to zero. At
this point the recombination reaction terminates and the stable
methoxy coverage yM,end is found. This methoxy coverage
corresponds to the methoxy groups that produce formaldehyde
upon
heating
and
can
be
compared
to
the
measured
formaldehyde signal for various methanol doses at RT. Such
a comparison is presented in Fig. 7(b), where the open circles
connected by the dashed line represent the modelled methoxy
coverage yM,end, for E1 and E2 equal to 0.85 eV per molecule.
The agreement between the experimental data and the model is
virtually perfect.
In our model, we only regard defects induced by the electron
beam reduction as possible adsorption sites for methoxy
groups. This approach ignores that the reaction of two
hydroxyl groups to form water produces additional surface
defects. For methanol adsorption on V2O3(0001) it was
unambiguously shown that the defects formed by water
formation
also
adsorb
methoxy
groups,
such
that
the
maximum methoxy coverage that can be obtained equals twice
the initial defect density.20 The right column in Fig. 4 shows
that this effect is not observed for V2O5(001), since the number
of methoxy groups that could be adsorbed with a dose of
200 L at room temperature is approximately equal to the
number of defects created by e-beam reduction while not too
many
unoccupied
isolated
defects
remain
visible
after
methanol dosage. However, all three panels in Fig. 4 show
that the number of unoccupied type B defects increases after
exposure to methanol. We assume that single defects catalyse
water formation, which would lead to double defects after
water desorption. This process would not just render inactive
the defects produced by water desorption but also those
defects which catalysed water formation. On the other hand,
we do not know whether the formation of isolated defects by
water desorption can really be excluded. If this process does
occur, the isolated defects produced this way could partly or
fully counterbalance the loss of active defects due to formation
of type B double defects.
Dosing
10
L
methanol
at
temperatures
below
the
temperature range where methoxyOH recombination and
hydroxylhydroxyl combination take place, results in a
considerably lower formaldehyde yield compared to 10 L at
room temperature (see triangle marker in Fig. 7). This
indicates that dosing at low temperature followed by warming
up leads to more methanol formation via methoxyhydroxyl
recombination and thus a smaller final methoxy coverage and
a smaller formaldehyde yield than dosing at room tempera-
ture. A likely origin for this difference is the influence of
diffusion. The room temperature STM images do not show
any evidence that the methoxy species are mobile, so that it is
safe to assume that at RT and below the surface methoxy
groups do not diffuse. On the other hand, hydroxyl groups
probably do diffuse on the surface since otherwise the
formation of water via reaction of hydroxyl groups would
not be explainable in view of the limited density of adsorption
sites on the surface. The diffusing hydroxyl groups can either
react with a methoxy group to form methanol or react with
another hydroxyl group to form water. In the case of water
formation both reaction partners diffuse on the surface, such
that this reaction profits more from a faster surface diffusion
at higher temperature than the formation of methanol. This is
in agreement with the experimental findings: the larger
mobility of hydroxyl groups at higher temperature results in
a higher water formation rate, such that the hydroxyl coverage
decreases more rapidly and a larger final methoxy coverage is
achieved. There are other ingredients in this discussion,
like the possible small separation of methoxy and hydroxyl
after their formation from methanol. This could favour
methoxyOH combination at low temperature when hydroxyl
diffusion is slow as well as different attempt frequencies for the
water and methanol formation reactions.

In order to assess whether the calculated values of the
energy barriers are correct, we have calculated water and
methanol desorption spectra (for the reaction of hydroxyl
groups to form water and the reaction of methoxy with
hydroxyl groups to form methanol). In this way the energy
barriers of these reaction can be extracted from the methanol
desorption temperature (B275 K) found in the TPD spectra of
Fig. 5. Since the methoxyOH recombination, leading to
methanol desorption and OH combination, leading to water
desorption have to be taken into account simultaneously, the
standard analysis of Redhead30 cannot be directly used. To
describe the current case we formulate differential equations
for the change in methoxy and OH coverage with temperature
T for a linear heating rate b:

We assume that for temperatures safely below the desorption
temperature all defect sites are covered with methoxy groups,
therefore we set yM(100 K) = yOH(100 K) = 0.075. The
methoxy and OH coverages are calculated as function of
temperature by numerically solving the differential eqn (7)
and (8). A good agreement with the experimentally observed
desorption temperature is obtained for E1 = E2 = 0.75 eV per
molecule.
Fig. 8(a) shows the calculated methoxy and hydroxyl
coverage as a function of temperature, whereas panel (b)
displays the calculated TPD signals for methanol and water.
After complete OH loss, the methoxy coverage stabilises at
approximately half of the initial coverage, which is in reason-
able agreement with the experimental results: according to
XPS (see Fig. 6) the methoxy coverage at 230 K is about
2-times as high as at 350 K. We note that in our model the
peak temperatures of the calculated methanol and water peak
are approximately equal. This implies that for the measured
spectrum in Fig. 5 the mass 18 peak resulting from water
formed by the combination reaction of hydroxyl groups over-
laps with the mass 18 peak originating from the exchange
reaction of desorbing methanol in the mass spectrometer
housing. The weak water desorption signal between 230 K
and 300 K thus probably also contains a contribution of water
formed via reaction of hydroxyl groups.
The energy barriers for methoxyOH recombination and
OHOH group combination are 0.1 eV lower for LT adsorp-
tion (obtained via modelling the temperature of recombinative
methanol desorption of a low temperature methanol adsorbate)
than for RT adsorption (obtained via modelling of the data
presented in Fig. 7(b)). In view of the assumptions and
simplifications of the used models, we feel that the agreement
is quite reasonable. Apart from simplifications like neglecting
the influence of diffusion and the use of a fixed attempt
frequency of 1013 s1, possible coverage-dependences of the
energy barriers and the attempt frequencies were both not
included. Another possible error source is the presence of
different types of surface defects (single, double, triple, etc),
which may exhibit different reactivies and thus would need to
be considered independently in eqn (4) and (5). However, in
view of the limited number of data points and the noise of the
data we feel that this probably would not give reliable results
and constrained the calculations to a single activation
energy/attempt frequency pair, which would approximately
model the most abundant and active type of defect.

DFT results on methanol adsorption
The experiments show that unreduced V2O5(001) interacts
only weakly with methanol. DFT calculations with the PBE
functional using a 3  1 surface unit cell, yield an adsorption
energy of 0.16 eV which supports the experimental result. The
energy for the formation of a surface vanadyl oxygen vacancy
on V2O5(001) is reduced by a strong lattice relaxation effect.
For a single defect on a 3  1 surface we obtain 1.84 eV, in
good agreement with previous work31,32 (see also Hermann
et al.33 who previously discussed the case of oxygen vacancy
formation
and
water
as
well
as
OH
desorption
from
V2O5(001)). This particularly low defect formation energy is
due to the formation of a VOV bond to the vanadyl oxygen
of the second crystal layer. Hereby, two VIV ions are created,
which is preferable to one VIII and one VV. The surface
vanadium atom retains a fivefold coordination due to the
formation of the bond. This also has the consequence that

the energy gain upon adsorption is relatively low. DFT yields
an adsorption energy of 0.64 eV for molecular methanol
bound in the geometry shown in Fig. 9A. A hydrogen bond
to the adjacent vanadyl oxygen in the row stabilises the
structure. A structure with a hydrogen bond to the vanadyl
oxygen at the other side of the double row (i.e. across the
surface VOV bridge) is only 0.01 eV less stable. The energy
for dissociative adsorption with the methoxy bound to the
vanadium atom at the defect site and the hydrogen atom to a
surface oxygen atom depends on the binding site of the
hydrogen atom. For the structures shown in Fig. 9B and 9C
DFT yields energies of 0.41 and 0.57 eV, respectively. For
hydrogen bound to a neighbouring vanadyl oxygen atom in
the same row (not shown here) the energy is 0.34 eV.
Dissociative adsorption is disfavoured for these structures
since the energies are all smaller than the one for molecular
adsorption
(0.64
eV).
However,
a
structure
where
the
hydrogen atom is located below the surface and binds to a
bridging oxygen atom (Fig. 9D) is energetically more stable
than a molecular adsorbate. DFT yields an energy of 0.67 eV
which is 0.03 eV larger than the energy of molecularly
adsorbed methanol.
In the case of water adsorption on a single vanadyl oxygen
vacancy
molecular
adsorption
is
clearly
favoured
over
dissociative adsorption. The most stable adsorption geometries
of molecular water on a single defect and the hydroxyl groups
resulting
from
dissociation
of
this
water
molecule
are
illustrated in Fig. 10A and 10B. The binding energies are
0.64 eV (molecular) and 0.44 eV (dissociated) which means
that hydroxyl groups on the surface will react to form water as
soon as the temperature is high enough to overcome the
energy barriers associated with water formation. The structure
shown in Fig. 10B is stabilised by hydrogen bonds between
the hydroxyl groups and the vanadyl groups in the opposite
rows. A structure where two hydroxyl groups bend towards
the same vanadyl group is shown in Fig. 10C. Starting from
this structure water could be formed by transfer of hydrogen.
With a binding energy of 0.36 eV this structure is energetically
slightly disfavoured over the structure shown in Fig. 10B.
With the aim of acquiring information regarding the
formation of type B double defects the adsorption of mole-
cular and dissociated water near to a vanadyl oxygen vacancy
was also studied. Fig. 11A illustrates the structure of water
adsorbed on one of the two defects of a type B double defect.
The binding energy of this structure is 0.74 eV which is slightly
larger than the binding energy of water on a single defect
(0.64 eV). After dissociation of the water molecule and transfer
of the hydrogen atoms to the neighbouring vanadyl atoms in
the same vanadyl row the structure displayed in Fig. 11B
results. The energy of the configuration is 0.38 eV. These
results do not directly give a clue for the mechanism of the
formation of type B defects since the fact that the binding
energies are different does not mean that water desorption
from a site with a neighbouring defect is preferred over
desorption from other sites. However, the results clearly, and
not unexpectedly, show that the presence of a defect modifies
the adsorption energetics. This will not just apply to binding
energies but also to reaction barriers. We assume that the
reason for the formation of type B defects is a modified
reaction barrier. The hydroxyl groups resulting from methanol
dissociation cannot desorb directly; they must react to form
water before they can desorb. We assume that the presence of
a defect lowers the reaction barrier for water formation such
that this reaction is promoted in the vicinity of a defect. After
water formation the molecules may desorb, leaving behind a
new oxygen vacancy in the geometry of a type B defect. Thus,

Summary
The partial oxidation of methanol on V2O5(001) films
supported on Au(111) was investigated. On non-reduced
surfaces
methanol
adsorbs
only
in
molecular
form,
consequently no formaldehyde production takes place. On
reduced surfaces methanol forms methoxy groups, which react
to produce formaldehyde in the temperature range from 400 K
to 550 K. Other reaction products were not observed.
Methoxy groups can be stabilised at room temperature only
when the surface is free of hydroxyl groups since otherwise
methoxy and hydroxyl groups may react to form methanol,
which desorbs between 230 and 300 K. Hydroxyl groups can
also react with other hydroxyl groups to form water, which
probably desorbs in the same temperature regime. If large
amounts of methanol are dosed at room temperature, water
formation removes all hydroxyl groups from the surface,
which finally stabilises a layer of methoxy.
STM images show that the density of surface defects
decreases due to methoxy formation, except for pair defects
perpendicular to the vanadyl double rows whose density
increases upon methanol dosage. We attribute this to the
promotion of water formation from hydroxyl groups near to
a single defect via a reduction of the energy barrier. Water
desorption produces another oxygen vacancy so that a
vacancy pair results.
Numerical simulations were performed using a kinetic
model that includes both the reaction of methoxy and hydroxyl
groups to form methanol and the simultaneous combination
of OH groups to form water. The results are in good agree-
ment with experimental data for the formaldehyde yield as a
function of the methanol dose at 300 K using activation
energies of 0.85 eV for methanol and water formation and
attempt frequencies of 1013 s1. From a simulation of TPD
data, activation energies of 0.75 eV were obtained. These
values are considered to be in reasonable agreement in view
of the simplifications that were used in the model.
DFT essentially supports the experimental findings. Mole-
cular methanol is only weakly bound to a non-defective
vanadyl-terminated V2O5(001) surface (EB = 0.16 eV). The
bond to a vanadyl oxygen vacancy is stronger (0.64 eV).
Dissociation into surface-bound methoxy and hydrogen is
only slightly preferred (0.67 eV, with the hydrogen atom
bound to a bridging oxygen atom). Molecular water on a
defect has the same binding energy as molecular methanol
(0.64) but dissociated water is less strongly bound (0.44 eV).
Molecular adsorption on a double defect of type B geometry
gives a slightly stronger bond for molecular water (0.74 eV)
whereas the energy of the dissociated state is reduced
(0.38 eV). We assume that the presence of the defect not only
modifies the binding energies but also the reaction barrier for
water formation which might be reason for the increase of the
density
of
the
type
B
double
defects
upon
methanol
adsorption. However, further theoretical effort would be
required to substantiate this hypothesis.
