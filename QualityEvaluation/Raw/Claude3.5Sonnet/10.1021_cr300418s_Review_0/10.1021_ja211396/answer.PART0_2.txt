[1] "Whereas Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the gold, Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal."

[2] "The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants are derived from different growth morphologies with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion."

[3] "Our work demonstrates how oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts."

[4] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge. This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy. As a result, the Mo dopant becomes oxidized while the Au atom takes a negative charge."

[5] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion. In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Charge transfer: Dopants like Mo can act as electron donors, providing excess charges that can be transferred to adsorbed metal particles (e.g., Au). This results in anionic metal species with altered electronic properties.

2. Creation of electron traps: Some dopants like Li can create electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow and affecting the electronic structure of the surface.

3. Modification of growth morphology: The charge state of adsorbed metal particles, influenced by dopants, can alter their growth behavior. For example, anionic gold favors 2D island formation due to enhanced interface adhesion.

4. Alteration of chemical bonding: Dopants can change the oxidation states of both themselves and adsorbed species. For instance, Mo dopants become oxidized while transferring electrons to Au atoms.

5. Enhanced metal-oxide interactions: Charged metal species (e.g., anionic gold) can develop strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the oxide surface, leading to substantial metal-oxide adhesion.

These modifications have several implications for catalytic activity enhancement:

1. Tailoring of active site geometry: By controlling the growth morphology of metal particles, doping can optimize the shape and distribution of catalytically active sites.

2. Tuning electronic properties: The altered charge states of metal particles can influence their ability to adsorb and activate reactant molecules.

3. Increased metal-support interactions: Enhanced adhesion between metal particles and the oxide support can stabilize catalytic sites and potentially modify their reactivity.

4. Creation of new active centers: The dopants themselves or their interaction with adsorbed species may create new types of catalytic sites.

5. Improved control over particle size and dispersion: The ability to influence growth behavior through doping can lead to better control over catalyst particle size and distribution.

These effects could potentially lead to improvements in industrially relevant reactions by allowing for more precise control over catalyst properties, optimizing active site geometry and electronic structure, and enhancing catalyst stability. However, the specific impacts would depend on the particular reaction and catalyst system in question.

金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过几种方式显著改变表面化学性质和破坏化学键合：

1. 电荷转移：像Mo这样的掺杂剂可以作为电子供体，提供可以转移到吸附金属颗粒（如Au）的过量电荷。这导致了具有改变电子性质的阴离子金属物种。

2. 创建电子陷阱：像Li这样的一些掺杂剂可以在氧化物晶格中创建电子陷阱，中断电荷流动并影响表面的电子结构。

3. 改变生长形态：受掺杂剂影响的吸附金属颗粒的电荷状态可以改变其生长行为。例如，阴离子金由于增强的界面粘附而倾向于形成2D岛状结构。

4. 改变化学键合：掺杂剂可以改变自身和吸附物种的氧化态。例如，Mo掺杂剂在向Au原子转移电子时会被氧化。

5. 增强金属-氧化物相互作用：带电金属物种（如阴离子金）可以与氧化物表面产生强烈的库仑和极化子相互作用，导致显著的金属-氧化物粘附。

这些修饰对催化活性增强有几个影响：

1. 调整活性位点几何形状：通过控制金属颗粒的生长形态，掺杂可以优化催化活性位点的形状和分布。

2. 调节电子性质：金属颗粒改变的电荷状态可以影响其吸附和活化反应分子的能力。

3. 增加金属-支撑体相互作用：金属颗粒与氧化物支撑体之间增强的粘附可以稳定催化位点并可能改变其反应活性。

4. 创造新的活性中心：掺杂剂本身或其与吸附物种的相互作用可能创造新型催化位点。

5. 改善对粒子尺寸和分散性的控制：通过掺杂影响生长行为的能力可以更好地控制催化剂粒子尺寸和分布。

这些效果可能通过允许更精确地控制催化剂性质、优化活性位点几何形状和电子结构以及增强催化剂稳定性，从而导致工业相关反应的改进。然而，具体影响将取决于特定的反应和催化剂系统。
