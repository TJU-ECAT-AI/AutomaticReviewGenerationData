[1] "Whereas Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the gold, Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal."

[2] "The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants are derived from different growth morphologies with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion."

[3] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge. This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."

[4] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion. In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts like CaO can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Electron donation/trapping: Dopants like Mo can act as electron donors, providing excess charges that can be transferred to adsorbed metal particles like Au. In contrast, dopants like Li can create electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow.

2. Charge state modification: The presence of dopants can lead to different charge states of adsorbed metal particles. For example, Mo doping can result in anionic gold particles.

3. Adhesion enhancement: Anionic metal particles (e.g. Au) can have enhanced adhesion to the oxide surface due to strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions.

4. Morphology changes: The modified charge states and enhanced adhesion can lead to changes in growth morphology of metal particles. For instance, anionic gold tends to form 2D islands rather than 3D particles to maximize charge-mediated coupling with the surface.

These modifications have several implications for catalytic activity:

1. Active center creation: The charge transfer between dopants and adsorbed metals can create new active centers with unique electronic properties.

2. Improved dispersion: Enhanced adhesion and 2D growth can lead to better dispersion of metal particles, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

3. Electronic structure tuning: The ability to control charge states of adsorbed metals through doping allows for fine-tuning of their electronic structure, which can be crucial for catalytic activity.

4. Reaction selectivity: Changes in metal particle morphology and electronic structure can affect reaction selectivity.

While the study doesn't directly discuss specific industrial reactions, these findings suggest potential for improving catalysts in various applications where metal/oxide interfaces play a crucial role, such as in CO oxidation, hydrogenation reactions, or fuel cell catalysts.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并影响化学键合:

1. 电子捐赠/捕获：像Mo这样的掺杂剂可以作为电子供体，提供多余的电荷转移到吸附的金属颗粒(如Au)上。相反，像Li这样的掺杂剂可以在氧化物晶格中创造电子陷阱，中断电荷流动。

2. 电荷状态修改：掺杂剂的存在可以导致吸附金属颗粒的不同电荷状态。例如，Mo掺杂可以导致金颗粒带负电。

3. 增强粘附：带负电的金属颗粒(如Au)由于强的库仑力和极化子相互作用，可以与氧化物表面有更强的粘附力。

4. 形态变化：修改后的电荷状态和增强的粘附力可以导致金属颗粒生长形态的变化。例如，带负电的金倾向于形成2D岛状结构而不是3D颗粒，以最大化与表面的电荷介导耦合。

这些修改对催化活性有几个影响：

1. 活性中心的创造：掺杂剂和吸附金属之间的电荷转移可以创造具有独特电子性质的新活性中心。

2. 改善分散性：增强的粘附力和2D生长可以导致金属颗粒更好的分散，可能增加活性位点的数量。

3. 电子结构调节：通过掺杂控制吸附金属的电荷状态的能力允许对其电子结构进行精细调节，这对催化活性至关重要。

4. 反应选择性：金属颗粒形态和电子结构的变化可能影响反应选择性。

虽然这项研究没有直接讨论具体的工业反应，但这些发现表明在金属/氧化物界面起关键作用的各种应用中，如CO氧化、氢化反应或燃料电池催化剂，都有潜力改进催化剂。
