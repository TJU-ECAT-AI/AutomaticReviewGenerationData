          [1] "Whereas Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the gold, Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal."

[2] "The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants are derived from different growth morphologies with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion."

[3] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge. This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."

[4] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion. In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."

[5] "Adding small amounts of Li to the Mo-doped CaO reinstalls the initial 3D growth regime. We assign this morphology crossover to charge transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."

[6] "Our work demonstrates how oxide doping can be exploited to tailor the equilibrium geometry of ad-particles on supported metal catalysts."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts like CaO modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding through several mechanisms:

1. Charge transfer: Dopants like Mo act as electron donors, providing excess charges that transfer to adsorbed metals (e.g., Au), altering their charge state.

2. Electron trapping: Dopants like Li create electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow to metal particles.

3. Adhesion modification: The charge state of metal particles influences their adhesion to the oxide surface. Anionic gold shows enhanced adhesion and tends to form 2D islands.

4. Morphology control: By controlling dopants, metal particle growth can be tailored between 2D and 3D forms.

5. Electronic structure alteration: Dopants can modify the band structure of the oxide, affecting its ability to exchange charges with adsorbates.

These modifications have several implications for catalytic activity:

1. Enhanced activity: Control over particle morphology and charge state can lead to more active catalysts, as certain shapes (e.g., 2D islands) may be more catalytically active for specific reactions.

2. New active centers: Charge transfer between dopants and metal particles creates new types of active sites with different electronic properties.

3. Improved metal-support interactions: Enhanced adhesion between metal particles and the oxide support could lead to more stable catalysts and influence reactivity at the metal-oxide interface.

4. Tailored catalysts: Fine-tuning particle shape and electronic properties through doping allows for the development of catalysts optimized for specific reactions.

5. Increased dispersion: Enhanced adhesion and 2D growth can lead to better dispersion of metal particles, potentially increasing the number of active sites.

These effects could potentially improve industrially relevant reactions by allowing more precise control over catalyst properties, optimizing active site geometry and electronic structure, and enhancing catalyst stability. The ability to tailor particle shape and charge state through selective doping represents a promising strategy for rationally designing improved heterogeneous catalysts.

          金属氧化物催化剂（如CaO）中的替代性阳离子掺杂通过几种机制改变表面化学性质并影响化学键合：

1. 电荷转移：像Mo这样的掺杂剂充当电子供体，提供可以转移到吸附金属（如Au）的过量电荷，改变其电荷状态。

2. 电子陷阱：像Li这样的掺杂剂在氧化物晶格中创造电子陷阱，中断向金属粒子的电荷流动。

3. 粘附性修改：金属粒子的电荷状态影响其与氧化物表面的粘附。阴离子金表现出增强的粘附性，倾向于形成2D岛状结构。

4. 形貌控制：通过控制掺杂剂，可以在2D和3D形式之间调节金属粒子的生长形貌。

5. 电子结构改变：掺杂剂可以改变氧化物的能带结构，影响其与吸附物交换电荷的能力。

这些修改对催化活性有几个影响：

1. 活性增强：控制粒子形貌和电荷状态可能导致更活跃的催化剂，因为某些形状（如2D岛状结构）可能对特定反应具有更高的催化活性。

2. 新的活性中心：掺杂剂和金属粒子之间的电荷转移创造了具有不同电子性质的新型活性位点。

3. 改善金属-支撑体相互作用：金属粒子与氧化物支撑体之间增强的粘附性可能导致更稳定的催化剂，并影响金属-氧化物界面的反应性。

4. 定制催化剂：通过掺杂精细调节粒子形状和电子性质，可以开发针对特定反应优化的催化剂。

5. 提高分散性：增强的粘附力和2D生长可以导致金属颗粒更好的分散，可能增加活性位点的数量。

这些效果可能通过允许更精确地控制催化剂性质、优化活性位点几何形状和电子结构以及增强催化剂稳定性，从而改进工业相关反应。通过选择性掺杂来调整粒子形状和电荷状态的能力代表了一种有前景的理性设计改进型多相催化剂的策略。
