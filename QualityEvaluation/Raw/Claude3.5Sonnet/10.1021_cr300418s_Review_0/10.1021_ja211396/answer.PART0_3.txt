[1] "Whereas Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the gold, Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal."

[2] "The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants are derived from different growth morphologies with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion."

[3] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge. This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."

[4] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion. In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Charge transfer: Dopants like Mo act as electron donors, providing excess charges that can be transferred to adsorbed metals like gold. This changes the charge state of the metal particles.

2. Electron trapping: Dopants like Li can create electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow to metal particles.

3. Adhesion modification: The charge state of metal particles influences their adhesion to the oxide surface. Negatively charged (anionic) gold shows enhanced adhesion and tends to form 2D islands rather than 3D particles.

4. Morphology control: By controlling the dopants, the growth morphology of metal particles can be tailored between 2D and 3D forms.

These modifications have several implications for catalysis:

1. Activity enhancement: The ability to control particle morphology and charge state could lead to more active catalysts, as certain shapes (e.g., 2D islands) may be more catalytically active for specific reactions.

2. Active center modification: The charge transfer between dopants and metal particles creates new types of active sites with different electronic properties.

3. Improved metal-support interactions: Enhanced adhesion between metal particles and the oxide support could lead to more stable catalysts and influence reactivity at the metal-oxide interface.

4. Tailored catalysts: The ability to fine-tune particle shape and electronic properties through doping could allow for the development of catalysts optimized for specific industrial reactions.

While the study focused on Au/CaO systems, these principles could potentially be applied to other metal/oxide combinations to improve catalytic performance in various industrially relevant reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂中的替代性阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并影响化学键合：

1. 电荷转移：像Mo这样的掺杂剂充当电子供体，提供可以转移到吸附金属（如金）的过量电荷。这改变了金属粒子的电荷状态。

2. 电子陷阱：像Li这样的掺杂剂可以在氧化物晶格中创造电子陷阱，中断向金属粒子的电荷流动。

3. 粘附性修改：金属粒子的电荷状态影响其与氧化物表面的粘附。带负电（阴离子）的金表现出增强的粘附性，倾向于形成2D岛状结构而不是3D颗粒。

4. 形貌控制：通过控制掺杂剂，可以在2D和3D形式之间调节金属粒子的生长形貌。

这些修改对催化作用有几个影响：

1. 活性增强：控制粒子形貌和电荷状态的能力可能导致更活跃的催化剂，因为某些形状（如2D岛状结构）可能对特定反应具有更高的催化活性。

2. 活性中心修饰：掺杂剂和金属粒子之间的电荷转移创造了具有不同电子性质的新型活性位点。

3. 改善金属-支撑体相互作用：金属粒子与氧化物支撑体之间增强的粘附性可能导致更稳定的催化剂，并影响金属-氧化物界面的反应性。

4. 定制催化剂：通过掺杂调节粒子形状和电子性质的能力可能允许开发针对特定工业反应优化的催化剂。

虽然该研究集中在Au/CaO系统上，但这些原理可能适用于其他金属/氧化物组合，以提高各种工业相关反应中的催化性能。
