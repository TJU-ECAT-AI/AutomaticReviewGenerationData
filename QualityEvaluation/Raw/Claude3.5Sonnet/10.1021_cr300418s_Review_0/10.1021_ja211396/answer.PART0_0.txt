[1] "Whereas Mo acts as an electron donor and provides excess charges to be transferred into the gold, Li creates electron traps in the oxide lattice that interrupt the charge flow toward the metal."

[2] "The different Au charge states in the presence of the dopants are derived from different growth morphologies with anionic gold favoring a 2D mode due to an enhanced interface adhesion."

[3] "Recent DFT calculations have shown that Mo impurities in a CaO host adopt a +2 charge state, though one of the four Mo 4d electrons occupies an energetically unfavorable t2g state close to the CB edge. This electron is prone to transfer to the Au 6s affinity level being at lower energy."

[4] "The anionic gold features strong Coulomb and polaronic interactions with the CaO surface, resulting in a substantial metaloxide adhesion. In an attempt to maximize this charge-mediated coupling, the gold increases its contact area with the oxide surface and spreads into monolayer islands."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Electron transfer: Dopants like Mo can act as electron donors, providing excess charges that can be transferred to adsorbed metal particles like Au. This changes the charge state of the metal and affects its binding to the oxide surface.

2. Creation of electron traps: Dopants like Li can create electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow and altering electronic properties.

3. Modification of metal-oxide interactions: The charge transfer enabled by dopants can enhance metal-oxide adhesion, leading to changes in growth morphology (e.g. 2D vs 3D islands) of deposited metal particles.

4. Alteration of electronic structure: Dopants can occupy specific electronic states and modify the band structure of the oxide, affecting its ability to exchange charges with adsorbates.

These modifications have several implications for catalysis:

1. Enhanced catalytic activity: The altered charge states and morphologies of metal particles can lead to increased reactivity for certain reactions.

2. New active centers: The dopants themselves or the metal-dopant interfaces may serve as new catalytically active sites.

3. Tailored particle shapes: By controlling dopant types and concentrations, the shape of metal deposits can be tailored, potentially optimizing catalytic performance.

4. Improved stability: Enhanced metal-oxide adhesion may lead to more stable catalysts under reaction conditions.

5. Tunable selectivity: The modified electronic properties could alter reaction pathways, potentially improving selectivity for desired products.

These effects could potentially be exploited to improve industrially relevant reactions, particularly those involving supported metal catalysts on oxide supports. However, further research is needed to fully understand and control these complex dopant-induced effects in practical catalytic systems.

金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并扰乱化学键合：

1. 电子转移：像Mo这样的掺杂剂可以作为电子供体，提供多余的电荷转移到吸附的金属颗粒（如Au）上。这改变了金属的电荷状态，影响其与氧化物表面的结合。

2. 创造电子陷阱：像Li这样的掺杂剂可以在氧化物晶格中创造电子陷阱，中断电荷流动并改变电子性质。

3. 改变金属-氧化物相互作用：掺杂剂促进的电荷转移可以增强金属-氧化物的粘附，导致沉积金属颗粒的生长形态发生变化（例如2D vs 3D岛状结构）。

4. 改变电子结构：掺杂剂可以占据特定的电子态，改变氧化物的能带结构，影响其与吸附物交换电荷的能力。

这些修改对催化作用有几个重要影响：

1. 增强催化活性：金属颗粒改变的电荷状态和形态可能导致某些反应活性增加。

2. 新的活性中心：掺杂剂本身或金属-掺杂剂界面可能成为新的催化活性位点。

3. 定制颗粒形状：通过控制掺杂剂类型和浓度，可以定制金属沉积物的形状，潜在地优化催化性能。

4. 提高稳定性：增强的金属-氧化物粘附可能导致催化剂在反应条件下更加稳定。

5. 可调选择性：改变的电子性质可能改变反应途径，潜在地提高对目标产物的选择性。

这些效果可能被用于改善工业相关反应，特别是那些涉及氧化物支撑的金属催化剂的反应。然而，还需要进一步的研究来充分理解和控制这些复杂的掺杂诱导效应在实际催化系统中的作用。
