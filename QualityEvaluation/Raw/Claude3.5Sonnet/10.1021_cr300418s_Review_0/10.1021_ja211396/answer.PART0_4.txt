Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding through charge transfer processes. Mo doping acts as an electron donor, providing excess charges that can transfer to adsorbed metal particles like gold. This leads to anionic gold species with enhanced adhesion to the oxide surface, favoring 2D island growth. In contrast, Li doping creates electron traps in the oxide lattice, interrupting charge flow to adsorbed metals and reinstating 3D particle growth.

These charge transfer effects have important implications for catalytic activity enhancement. The ability to tailor the equilibrium geometry of supported metal particles through oxide doping provides a means to optimize catalyst morphology. 2D metal islands with larger surface area and more edge sites could potentially increase the number of active centers. The nature and location of active sites may also be modified by the charge state of the metal particles.

While the study focused on a model CaO system, the principles demonstrated could potentially be applied to industrially relevant catalysts and reactions. Controlling particle shape and charge state through selective doping of oxide supports represents a promising strategy for rationally designing improved heterogeneous catalysts. However, further research would be needed to extend these findings to practical catalyst systems and specific reactions of interest.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过电荷转移过程显著改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键合。Mo掺杂作为电子供体，提供可以转移到吸附金属颗粒(如金)的过量电荷。这导致了与氧化物表面具有增强粘附力的阴离子金物种，有利于2D岛状生长。相比之下，Li掺杂在氧化物晶格中创造电子陷阱，中断了向吸附金属的电荷流动，恢复了3D颗粒生长。

这些电荷转移效应对提高催化活性具有重要影响。通过氧化物掺杂调整支撑金属颗粒的平衡几何形状的能力为优化催化剂形态提供了一种方法。具有更大表面积和更多边缘位点的2D金属岛可能会增加活性中心的数量。金属颗粒的电荷状态也可能改变活性位点的性质和位置。

虽然该研究集中在CaO模型系统上，但所展示的原理可能适用于工业相关的催化剂和反应。通过选择性掺杂氧化物载体来控制颗粒形状和电荷状态，代表了一种有前景的理性设计改进型多相催化剂的策略。然而，还需要进一步的研究来将这些发现扩展到实际的催化剂系统和特定的感兴趣反应中。
