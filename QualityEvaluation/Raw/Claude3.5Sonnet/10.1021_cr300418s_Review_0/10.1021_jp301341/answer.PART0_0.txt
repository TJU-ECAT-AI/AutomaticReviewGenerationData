[1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."

[2] "Oxides are useful catalysts, and the chemisorption of molecules on oxide surfaces has been the subject of numerous density functional calculations. In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs."

[3] "There is much work, both experimental and computational, that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."

[4] "We point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."

[5] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can change the Lewis acid-base properties of the oxide surface. Doping with low-valence cations (LVDs) turns the surface into a Lewis acid.

2. This acidic character lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which is important for many catalytic reactions.

3. It increases the binding energy of Lewis bases (like H, CH3, CO) to the doped oxide surface.

4. It makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic, facilitating C-H bond activation.

5. These changes create new active centers on the catalyst surface, often centered around the dopant sites.

The implications for catalytic activity enhancement are significant:

1. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy can improve the oxide's ability to participate in Mars-van Krevelen oxidation mechanisms.

2. Stronger binding of reaction intermediates can stabilize transition states and lower activation barriers.

3. Easier C-H bond activation can improve activity for hydrocarbon conversion reactions.

4. The creation of new active sites increases the number of catalytic centers.

These modifications have potential to improve industrially relevant reactions such as partial oxidations, dehydrogenations, and alkane activations. The ability to tune catalyst properties through doping provides a powerful tool for rational catalyst design, potentially enabling more efficient and selective processes in chemical manufacturing, energy conversion, and environmental applications.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键合:

1. 它可以改变氧化物表面的路易斯酸碱性质。用低价阳离子(LVDs)掺杂会使表面变成路易斯酸。

2. 这种酸性特征降低了氧空位形成所需的能量，这对许多催化反应很重要。

3. 它增加了路易斯碱(如H、CH3、CO)与掺杂氧化物表面的结合能。

4. 它使烷烃的解离吸附变得更加放热，有利于C-H键的活化。

5. 这些变化在催化剂表面创造了新的活性中心，通常集中在掺杂剂位点周围。

对催化活性增强的影响是显著的:

1. 较低的氧空位形成能可以改善氧化物参与Mars-van Krevelen氧化机理的能力。

2. 反应中间体的结合更强，可以稳定过渡态并降低活化能垒。

3. 更容易的C-H键活化可以提高烃类转化反应的活性。

4. 新活性位点的创造增加了催化中心的数量。

这些修饰有可能改进工业相关反应，如部分氧化、脱氢和烷烃活化。通过掺杂调整催化剂性质的能力为合理设计催化剂提供了强大的工具，有可能在化学制造、能量转换和环境应用中实现更高效和选择性的过程。
