[1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."

[2] "Oxides are useful catalysts, and the chemisorption of molecules on oxide surfaces has been the subject of numerous density functional calculations. In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs."

[3] "There is much work, both experimental and computational, that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."

[4] "We point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."

[5] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. It can change the Lewis acid-base properties of the oxide surface. Doping with low-valence cations (LVDs) turns the surface into a Lewis acid.

2. This acidic character lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, which is important for many catalytic reactions.

3. It increases the binding energy of Lewis bases (like H, CH3, CO) to the doped oxide surface.

4. It makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic, facilitating C-H bond activation.

5. These changes create new active centers on the catalyst surface, often centered around the dopant sites.

The implications for catalytic activity enhancement are significant:

1. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy can improve the oxide's ability to participate in Mars-van Krevelen oxidation mechanisms.

2. Stronger binding of reaction intermediates can stabilize transition states and lower activation barriers.

3. Easier C-H bond activation can improve activity for hydrocarbon conversion reactions.

4. The creation of new active sites increases the number of catalytic centers.

These modifications have potential to improve industrially relevant reactions such as partial oxidations, dehydrogenations, and alkane activations. The ability to tune catalyst properties through doping provides a powerful tool for rational catalyst design, potentially enabling more efficient and selective processes in chemical manufacturing, energy conversion, and environmental applications.

[3] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[4] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."

[5] "The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base. This modification can be achieved by preadsorbing on the surface electron donors. Conversely, the binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants."

- C-H bond activation for alkane conversion can be promoted on acidic surfaces
- Selective adsorption of reactants can be achieved by tuning surface acidity/basicity

The ability to predictably modify surface chemistry through doping provides a powerful tool for enhancing catalytic performance in various industrially relevant reactions.

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Low-valence dopants (replacing host cations with lower valence cations) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This increases the Lewis acidity of the surface, which has several effects:

2. High-valence dopants (replacing host cations with higher valence cations) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis base. This allows the surface to:

- Strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogens
- Potentially activate these adsorbed species for further reactions if not fully neutralized

These modifications have important implications for catalytic activity:

- They can create new active sites on the surface with different chemical properties
- They can change the binding strength and reactivity of adsorbed species
- They can alter reaction pathways and energetics

For industrially relevant reactions, this offers potential for:

- Lowering activation barriers for rate-limiting steps

- Enhancing catalyst stability by modifying surface properties

Overall, cation doping provides a powerful method to tune the acid-base properties of oxide surfaces, allowing rational design of catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for specific reactions. The ability to modify surface chemistry through doping opens up new possibilities for improving catalytic performance in various industrial processes.

[5] "Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This increases the binding energy of Lewis bases to the surface and lowers the energy required to form oxygen vacancies.

2. Doping can enhance catalytic activity by making the oxide a better oxidant. However, there is a "moderation principle" - the dopant should make oxygen removal easier, but not too easy, to maintain good catalytic performance.

3. Doping creates new active centers on the oxide surface. The dopant atoms and surrounding lattice sites often become preferential binding and reaction sites.

4. The Lewis acid-base properties introduced by doping can be used to predict and manipulate surface chemistry and reactivity. This provides a framework for rational catalyst design.

5. Doping can improve industrially relevant reactions like oxidation of CO or CH4 by modifying oxygen binding strength and vacancy formation energies. However, optimal doping levels must be determined to balance these effects.

6. The specific effects depend on the identity and concentration of the dopant as well as the host oxide. Computational screening can help identify promising dopant-oxide combinations for particular reactions.

Overall, substitutional doping offers a powerful way to tune the chemical properties of oxide surfaces and enhance catalytic performance, guided by Lewis acid-base principles. However, careful optimization is required to achieve the desired reactivity.
