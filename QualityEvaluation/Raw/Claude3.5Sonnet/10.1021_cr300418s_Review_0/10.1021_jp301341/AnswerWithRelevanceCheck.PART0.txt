          [1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."

[2] "Oxides are useful catalysts, and the chemisorption of molecules on oxide surfaces has been the subject of numerous density functional calculations. In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs."

[3] "There is much work, both experimental and computational, that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."

[4] "We point out that one can turn an oxide surface into a Lewis acid if one substitutes the cation of the host oxide with a lower-valence cation (which we call a low-valence dopant (LVD))."

[5] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

[6] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[7] "Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

          Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid, which:
   - Lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation
   - Increases the binding energy of Lewis bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface
   - Makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic

2. High-valence dopants turn the surface into a Lewis base, which:
   - Strongly adsorbs Lewis acids like O2 or halogens
   - Can activate these adsorbed species for further reactions if not fully neutralized

3. Doping creates new active centers on the oxide surface, often near the dopant sites.

4. It changes the nature and location of active sites by modifying local acid-base properties.

5. The "moderation principle" suggests optimal doping levels should balance ease of oxygen removal without making it too facile.

Implications for catalytic activity enhancement:

1. Lowering activation barriers for rate-limiting steps
2. Improving selectivity by favoring certain reaction pathways
3. Enhancing catalyst stability by modifying surface properties
4. Facilitating C-H bond activation in alkane conversion reactions
5. Improving oxidation catalysts by tuning oxygen binding and vacancy formation

Potential improvements in industrially relevant reactions:

1. Oxidation of CO or CH4
2. Alkane activation and conversion
3. Partial oxidations
4. Dehydrogenations

Overall, substitutional cation doping provides a powerful method to tune the acid-base properties of oxide surfaces, allowing for rational design of catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for specific reactions.

          金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂以几种方式改变表面化学性质并破坏化学键合：

1. 低价掺杂剂（LVDs）使氧化物表面变成Lewis酸，这将：
   - 降低氧空位形成的能量
   - 增加Lewis碱（如H、CH3、CO）与表面的结合能
   - 使烷烃的解离吸附变得更加放热

2. 高价掺杂剂使表面变成Lewis碱，这将：
   - 强烈吸附O2或卤素等Lewis酸
   - 如果没有完全中和，可能激活这些吸附物种进行进一步反应

3. 掺杂在氧化物表面创造新的活性中心，通常靠近掺杂位点。

4. 通过修改局部酸碱性质，改变了活性位点的性质和位置。

5. "适度原则"建议最佳掺杂水平应平衡氧去除的容易程度，不使其过于容易。

对催化活性增强的影响：

1. 降低速率限制步骤的活化能障
2. 通过favoring某些反应途径来提高选择性
3. 通过修改表面性质来增强催化剂稳定性
4. 促进烷烃转化反应中的C-H键活化
5. 通过调节氧结合和空位形成来改善氧化催化剂

在工业相关反应中的潜在改进：

1. CO或CH4的氧化
2. 烷烃活化和转化
3. 部分氧化
4. 脱氢反应

总的来说，取代阳离子掺杂提供了一种强大的方法来调节氧化物表面的酸碱性质，允许针对特定反应合理设计具有增强活性和选择性的催化剂。
