[4] "There is much work, both experimental and computational, that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."

[5] "Doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4). If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts can significantly modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Low-valence dopants (LVDs) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This increases the binding energy of Lewis bases to the surface and lowers the energy required to form oxygen vacancies.

2. Doping can enhance catalytic activity by making the oxide a better oxidant. However, there is a "moderation principle" - the dopant should make oxygen removal easier, but not too easy, to maintain good catalytic performance.

3. Doping creates new active centers on the oxide surface. The dopant atoms and surrounding lattice sites often become preferential binding and reaction sites.

4. The Lewis acid-base properties introduced by doping can be used to predict and manipulate surface chemistry and reactivity. This provides a framework for rational catalyst design.

5. Doping can improve industrially relevant reactions like oxidation of CO or CH4 by modifying oxygen binding strength and vacancy formation energies. However, optimal doping levels must be determined to balance these effects.

6. The specific effects depend on the identity and concentration of the dopant as well as the host oxide. Computational screening can help identify promising dopant-oxide combinations for particular reactions.

Overall, substitutional doping offers a powerful way to tune the chemical properties of oxide surfaces and enhance catalytic performance, guided by Lewis acid-base principles. However, careful optimization is required to achieve the desired reactivity.

金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂可以通过以下几种方式显著改变表面化学性质并扰乱化学键合:

1. 低价掺杂剂(LVDs)使氧化物表面变成Lewis酸。这增加了Lewis碱与表面的结合能,并降低了形成氧空位所需的能量。

2. 掺杂可以通过使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂来增强催化活性。然而,存在一个"适度原则" - 掺杂剂应该使氧的去除更容易,但不能太容易,以保持良好的催化性能。

3. 掺杂在氧化物表面创造新的活性中心。掺杂原子和周围的晶格位点通常成为优先结合和反应位点。

4. 掺杂引入的Lewis酸碱性质可用于预测和操纵表面化学和反应性。这为理性催化剂设计提供了框架。

5. 掺杂可以通过改变氧结合强度和空位形成能来改善CO或CH4氧化等工业相关反应。然而,必须确定最佳掺杂水平以平衡这些效应。

6. 具体效果取决于掺杂剂的身份和浓度以及宿主氧化物。计算筛选可以帮助识别特定反应的有前景的掺杂剂-氧化物组合。

总的来说,取代掺杂提供了一种强大的方法来调节氧化物表面的化学性质并增强催化性能,并以Lewis酸碱原理为指导。然而,需要仔细优化以达到所需的反应性。
