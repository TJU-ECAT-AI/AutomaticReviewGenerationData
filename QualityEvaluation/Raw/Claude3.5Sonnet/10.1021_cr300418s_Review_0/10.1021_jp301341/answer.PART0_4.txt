[1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."

[2] "Oxides are useful catalysts, and the chemisorption of molecules on oxide surfaces has been the subject of numerous density functional calculations. In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs."

[3] "Low-valence dopants turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid"

[4] "If doping an oxide with a LVD turns it into a Lewis acid, then doping should increase substantially the binding energy of any Lewis base, not just the formation of an oxygen vacancy. Calculations show that this is indeed the case."

[5] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

Substitutional cation doping with low-valence dopants (LVDs) in metal oxide catalysts modifies surface chemistry by turning the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This has several implications for catalytic activity:

1. It increases the binding energy of Lewis bases to the surface, enhancing interactions with reactant molecules.

2. It lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, which can create more active sites on the surface.

3. It makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic, potentially lowering activation barriers for C-H bond breaking.

4. It changes the nature of active centers by creating acidic sites on the surface.

5. It can potentially improve industrially relevant reactions like alkane activation and oxidation by facilitating reactant adsorption and bond breaking.

The location of active centers is modified to be near the dopant sites, as the LVDs create local regions of increased Lewis acidity. This disrupts the chemical bonding of nearby surface oxygen atoms, activating them for reactions.

Overall, LVD doping provides a way to tune the acid-base properties of oxide surfaces, allowing for targeted enhancement of catalytic activity for specific reactions by modifying reactant binding strengths and activation energies.

在金属氧化物催化剂中进行低价阳离子掺杂会通过将氧化物表面转变为Lewis酸来改变表面化学性质。这对催化活性有几个影响：

1. 它增加了Lewis碱与表面的结合能，增强了与反应物分子的相互作用。

2. 它降低了氧空位形成的能量，可以在表面创造更多的活性位点。

3. 它使烷烃的解离吸附更加放热，可能降低C-H键断裂的活化能垒。

4. 它通过在表面创造酸性位点改变了活性中心的性质。

5. 它可能通过促进反应物吸附和键断裂来改善工业相关反应，如烷烃活化和氧化。

活性中心的位置被修改为靠近掺杂位点，因为低价掺杂剂在局部区域创造了增加的Lewis酸性。这扰乱了附近表面氧原子的化学键合，使它们活化以进行反应。

总的来说，低价掺杂提供了一种调节氧化物表面酸碱性质的方法，通过修改反应物结合强度和活化能，可以针对特定反应有针对性地增强催化活性。
