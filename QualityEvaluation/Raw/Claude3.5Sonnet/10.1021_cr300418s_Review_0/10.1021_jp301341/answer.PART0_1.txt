[1] "We examine a large number of DFT calculations regarding the chemistry of oxide surfaces and show that their qualitative conclusions can be predicted by using a few rules derived from the Lewis acidbase properties of the species involved."

[2] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic"

[3] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

[4] "If a surface is modified to be a Lewis acid, to confer on it certain properties, these properties can be substantially suppressed by adsorbing on the surface a Lewis base. The system behaves as if the base neutralizes the acid."

[5] "The binding energy of a Lewis acid to an oxide surface can be increased substantially if the surface is modified to become a Lewis base. This modification can be achieved by preadsorbing on the surface electron donors. Conversely, the binding energy of a Lewis base can be increased by modifying the surface to become a Lewis acid, which can be achieved by doping with low-valence dopants."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts significantly modifies surface chemistry and chemical bonding through changes in Lewis acid-base properties:

1. Low-valence dopants make the oxide surface more acidic, which:
- Lowers the energy required to form oxygen vacancies
- Increases binding of basic species like H, CH3, CO
- Enhances dissociative adsorption of alkanes

2. High-valence dopants make the surface more basic, leading to:
- Strong adsorption of acidic species like O2 or halogens
- Potential activation of these adsorbed species for further reactions

3. The acid-base properties can be tuned to enhance specific catalytic activities:
- Acidic surfaces bind basic reactants more strongly
- Basic surfaces bind acidic reactants more strongly
- Careful balancing can optimize binding for catalysis

4. Doping creates new types of active sites:
- Low-valence dopants activate nearby oxygen atoms
- High-valence dopants can form reactive complexes with adsorbed species

5. These principles allow rational design of doped oxide catalysts for industrial reactions:
- Oxidation catalysts can be improved by enhancing oxygen activation
- C-H bond activation for alkane conversion can be promoted on acidic surfaces
- Selective adsorption of reactants can be achieved by tuning surface acidity/basicity

The ability to predictably modify surface chemistry through doping provides a powerful tool for enhancing catalytic performance in various industrially relevant reactions.
