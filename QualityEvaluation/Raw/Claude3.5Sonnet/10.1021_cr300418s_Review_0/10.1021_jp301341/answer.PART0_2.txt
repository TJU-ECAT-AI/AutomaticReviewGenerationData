[1] "Oxides are useful catalysts, and the chemisorption of molecules on oxide surfaces has been the subject of numerous density functional calculations. In this article, we show that the results of many such calculations can be derived from a few rules involving Lewis acidbase pairs."

[2] "There is much work, both experimental and computational, that explores the possibility that the catalytic activity of an oxide can be improved by substitutional doping (a small fraction of the cations of the oxide are replaced with different cations)."

[3] "Low-valence dopants turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid"

[4] "Oxides doped with low-valence dopants are Lewis acids. Because of this, they lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, increase the binding energy of various bases (e.g., H, CH3, CO) to the surface of the doped oxide, and make the dissociative adsorption an alkane RH more exothermic (because the fragments R and H produced by dissociation are Lewis bases and the surface is a Lewis acid)."

[5] "High-valence dopants are Lewis bases, and they adsorb strongly Lewis acids such as O2 or X2 (X is a halogen). If the basicity of the dopant is not excessive, the acidity of the adsorbed oxygen or Br2 is not completely neutralized, and they are able to react with Lewis bases."

Substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts significantly modifies surface chemistry and disrupts chemical bonding in several ways:

1. Low-valence dopants (replacing host cations with lower valence cations) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis acid. This increases the Lewis acidity of the surface, which has several effects:

- It lowers the energy required to form oxygen vacancies
- It increases the binding energy of Lewis bases (like H, CH3, CO) to the surface
- It makes dissociative adsorption of alkanes more exothermic

2. High-valence dopants (replacing host cations with higher valence cations) turn the oxide surface into a Lewis base. This allows the surface to:

- Strongly adsorb Lewis acids like O2 or halogens
- Potentially activate these adsorbed species for further reactions if not fully neutralized

These modifications have important implications for catalytic activity:

- They can create new active sites on the surface with different chemical properties
- They can change the binding strength and reactivity of adsorbed species
- They can alter reaction pathways and energetics

For industrially relevant reactions, this offers potential for:

- Lowering activation barriers for rate-limiting steps
- Improving selectivity by favoring certain reaction pathways
- Enhancing catalyst stability by modifying surface properties

Overall, cation doping provides a powerful method to tune the acid-base properties of oxide surfaces, allowing rational design of catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for specific reactions. The ability to modify surface chemistry through doping opens up new possibilities for improving catalytic performance in various industrial processes.

金属氧化物催化剂中的阳离子替代掺杂以几种方式显著改变了表面化学性质并破坏了化学键合：

1. 低价掺杂剂（用较低价态的阳离子替换主体阳离子）使氧化物表面变成路易斯酸。这增加了表面的路易斯酸性，产生了几个效果：

- 降低了形成氧空位所需的能量
- 增加了路易斯碱（如H、CH3、CO）与表面的结合能
- 使烷烃的解离吸附变得更加放热

2. 高价掺杂剂（用较高价态的阳离子替换主体阳离子）使氧化物表面变成路易斯碱。这使表面能够：

- 强烈吸附路易斯酸，如O2或卤素
- 如果没有完全中和，可能激活这些吸附物种进行进一步反应

这些修改对催化活性有重要影响：

- 它们可以在表面上创造具有不同化学性质的新活性位点
- 它们可以改变吸附物种的结合强度和反应活性
- 它们可以改变反应途径和能量学

对于工业相关反应，这提供了以下潜力：

- 降低速率限制步骤的活化能障
- 通过favoring某些反应途径来提高选择性
- 通过修改表面性质来增强催化剂稳定性

总的来说，阳离子掺杂提供了一种强大的方法来调节氧化物表面的酸碱性质，允许针对特定反应合理设计具有增强活性和选择性的催化剂。通过掺杂修改表面化学性质的能力为提高各种工业过程中的催化性能开辟了新的可能性。
