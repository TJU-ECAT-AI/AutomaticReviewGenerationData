[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[2] "It is evident from the tables that the effect of the presence of CCl4 on the conversion and selectivity is most strikingly reflected with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2. A dramatic increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is observed with these three catalysts."

[3] "The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CCl4 [5,10,19], that C2H6 is the primary C2 product and C2H4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6."

[4] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CCl4, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CCl4 and form Cl atoms or radicals."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss how adding a small amount of tetrachloromethane (CCl4) to the feed stream can significantly modify the catalytic activity of supported metal oxide catalysts for methane oxidative coupling.

The addition of CCl4 dramatically increases the yield of C2 hydrocarbons, especially for Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2 catalysts. This suggests that CCl4 is modifying the oxide surface and altering its catalytic properties.

The enhancement mechanism likely involves changes to surface acidity/basicity, incorporation of chlorine into the oxide, formation of metal-chlorine bonds, and generation of chlorine radicals from CCl4 decomposition on the surface. These modifications appear to create new active sites or alter existing ones to promote C-C coupling.

The CCl4 addition also affects product selectivity, increasing the ratio of ethylene to ethane. This implies it enhances the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, possibly through chlorine radicals.

While not substitutional doping, this study demonstrates how introducing a chlorine-containing additive can substantially modify oxide catalyst surfaces to enhance activity and selectivity for industrially relevant reactions like methane coupling. Further research into the exact surface modifications could provide insights for rationally designing improved catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。然而,它确实讨论了如何通过向进料流中添加少量四氯甲烷(CCl4)来显著改变负载型金属氧化物催化剂对甲烷氧化偶联的催化活性。

添加CCl4可大幅增加C2烃类的产率,尤其是对Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2催化剂。这表明CCl4正在修饰氧化物表面并改变其催化性能。

增强机制可能涉及表面酸度/碱度的变化、氯掺入氧化物、金属-氯键的形成,以及CCl4在表面分解生成氯自由基。这些修饰似乎创造了新的活性位点或改变了现有位点,从而促进C-C偶联。

CCl4的添加还影响产物选择性,增加了乙烯与乙烷的比例。这意味着它增强了乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢,可能是通过氯自由基实现的。

虽然这不是替代掺杂,但这项研究表明,引入含氯添加剂可以显著改变氧化物催化剂表面,从而提高工业相关反应(如甲烷偶联)的活性和选择性。对确切表面修饰的进一步研究可能为合理设计改进的催化剂提供见解。
