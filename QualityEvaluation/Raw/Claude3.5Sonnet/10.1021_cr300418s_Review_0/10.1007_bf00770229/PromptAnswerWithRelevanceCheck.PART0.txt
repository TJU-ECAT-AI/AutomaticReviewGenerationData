[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[2] "It is evident from the tables that the effect of the presence of CCl4 on the conversion and selectivity is most strikingly reflected with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2. A dramatic increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is observed with these three catalysts."

[3] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CCl4 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."

[4] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CCl4, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CCl4 and form Cl atoms or radicals."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the effects of adding tetrachloromethane (CCl4) to the feed stream for various metal oxide catalysts supported on silica. This addition of CCl4 can be seen as a form of surface modification that affects catalytic activity.

The presence of CCl4 dramatically enhances the formation of C2 hydrocarbons, particularly for Ba, Cs, and Mn oxides supported on silica. This suggests that the chlorine-containing species modifies the catalyst surface, potentially altering its acidity/basicity, incorporating chlorine into the oxide structure, or forming metal-chlorine bonds.

These modifications likely create new active sites or alter existing ones, leading to improved catalytic performance in the oxidative coupling of methane. The exact nature and location of these active centers are not specified, but they appear to promote C-C bond formation and C-H bond activation.

The study implies that such surface modifications could be applied to improve industrially relevant reactions, particularly in the conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons. However, the effects vary significantly depending on the specific metal oxide used, indicating that the interaction between the chlorine species and the oxide surface is complex and catalyst-dependent.

While this approach differs from traditional substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how surface modifications can significantly enhance catalytic activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的阳离子掺杂替代。然而，它确实讨论了向各种以二氧化硅为载体的金属氧化物催化剂的进料流中添加四氯化碳（CCl4）的效果。这种CCl4的添加可以被视为一种影响催化活性的表面修饰形式。

CCl4的存在显著增强了C2烃的形成，特别是对于以二氧化硅为载体的Ba、Cs和Mn氧化物。这表明含氯物种改变了催化剂表面，可能改变了其酸度/碱度，将氯掺入氧化物结构中，或形成金属-氯键。

这些修饰可能创造了新的活性位点或改变了现有的活性位点，从而提高了甲烷氧化偶联反应的催化性能。虽然未指明这些活性中心的确切性质和位置，但它们似乎促进了C-C键的形成和C-H键的活化。

该研究暗示这种表面修饰可以应用于改善工业相关反应，特别是在将甲烷转化为更高碳氢化合物的过程中。然而，效果因所使用的特定金属氧化物而异，这表明氯物种与氧化物表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且依赖于催化剂。

虽然这种方法与传统的阳离子掺杂替代不同，但它展示了表面修饰如何能显著提高非均相催化中的催化活性和选择性。

[3] "The fact that an increase in oxygen concentration increases the ratio of C2H4 to C2H6 appears to indicate as suggested by others in the absence of CCl4 [5,10,19], that C2H6 is the primary C2 product and C2H4 is produced by the subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6."

[4] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CCl4, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CCl4 and form Cl atoms or radicals."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss how adding a small amount of tetrachloromethane (CCl4) to the feed stream can significantly modify the catalytic activity of supported metal oxide catalysts for methane oxidative coupling.

The addition of CCl4 dramatically increases the yield of C2 hydrocarbons, especially for Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2 catalysts. This suggests that CCl4 is modifying the oxide surface and altering its catalytic properties.

The enhancement mechanism likely involves changes to surface acidity/basicity, incorporation of chlorine into the oxide, formation of metal-chlorine bonds, and generation of chlorine radicals from CCl4 decomposition on the surface. These modifications appear to create new active sites or alter existing ones to promote C-C coupling.

The CCl4 addition also affects product selectivity, increasing the ratio of ethylene to ethane. This implies it enhances the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, possibly through chlorine radicals.

While not substitutional doping, this study demonstrates how introducing a chlorine-containing additive can substantially modify oxide catalyst surfaces to enhance activity and selectivity for industrially relevant reactions like methane coupling. Further research into the exact surface modifications could provide insights for rationally designing improved catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的替代阳离子掺杂。然而,它确实讨论了如何通过向进料流中添加少量四氯甲烷(CCl4)来显著改变负载型金属氧化物催化剂对甲烷氧化偶联的催化活性。

添加CCl4可大幅增加C2烃类的产率,尤其是对Ba/SiO2、Cs/SiO2和Mn/SiO2催化剂。这表明CCl4正在修饰氧化物表面并改变其催化性能。

增强机制可能涉及表面酸度/碱度的变化、氯掺入氧化物、金属-氯键的形成,以及CCl4在表面分解生成氯自由基。这些修饰似乎创造了新的活性位点或改变了现有位点,从而促进C-C偶联。

CCl4的添加还影响产物选择性,增加了乙烯与乙烷的比例。这意味着它增强了乙烷到乙烯的氧化脱氢,可能是通过氯自由基实现的。

虽然这不是替代掺杂,但这项研究表明,引入含氯添加剂可以显著改变氧化物催化剂表面,从而提高工业相关反应(如甲烷偶联)的活性和选择性。对确切表面修饰的进一步研究可能为合理设计改进的催化剂提供见解。

[1] "Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes."

[2] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[3] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."

[4] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form C1 atoms or radicals."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the effects of adding chloromethanes like CCl4 to the feed stream in methane conversion processes. The addition of these compounds can significantly influence catalytic activity and selectivity, depending on the nature of the oxide catalyst used. 

The effects may involve alterations to surface acidity/basicity, incorporation of chlorine into the oxide, formation of metal-chlorine bonds, or decomposition of CCl4 to form chlorine atoms/radicals on the catalyst surface. These mechanisms could potentially modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in ways that enhance catalytic activity or create new active centers.

While not explicitly about cation doping, these findings suggest that introducing chlorine-containing species can substantially modify oxide catalyst surfaces and catalytic properties. This may have implications for improving industrially relevant reactions like methane conversion, though more research would be needed to fully understand the mechanisms and optimize performance.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂。然而，它确实讨论了在甲烷转化过程中向进料中添加四氯化碳等氯甲烷的影响。这些化合物的添加可以显著影响催化活性和选择性，具体取决于所使用的氧化物催化剂的性质。

这些效果可能涉及表面酸度/碱度的改变、氯的掺入氧化物、金属-氯键的形成，或CCl4在催化剂表面分解形成氯原子/自由基。这些机制可能会以增强催化活性或创造新的活性中心的方式修改表面化学性质并干扰化学键合。

虽然没有明确涉及阳离子掺杂，但这些发现表明，引入含氯物质可以显著改变氧化物催化剂表面和催化性能。这可能对改进甲烷转化等工业相关反应有启示，尽管还需要更多研究来充分理解其机理并优化性能。
