[1] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[2] "It is evident from the tables that the effect of the presence of CCl4 on the conversion and selectivity is most strikingly reflected with Ba/SiO2, Cs/SiO2 and Mn/SiO2. A dramatic increase in the yield of C2 hydrocarbons is observed with these three catalysts."

[3] "The results presented show that among the catalysts examined the addition of CCl4 to the oxides of Ba, Cs and Mn supported on silica strikingly enhanced the formation of C2 hydrocarbons by oxidative dehydrogenation of methane."

[4] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CCl4, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CCl4 and form Cl atoms or radicals."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the effects of adding tetrachloromethane (CCl4) to the feed stream for various metal oxide catalysts supported on silica. This addition of CCl4 can be seen as a form of surface modification that affects catalytic activity.

The presence of CCl4 dramatically enhances the formation of C2 hydrocarbons, particularly for Ba, Cs, and Mn oxides supported on silica. This suggests that the chlorine-containing species modifies the catalyst surface, potentially altering its acidity/basicity, incorporating chlorine into the oxide structure, or forming metal-chlorine bonds.

These modifications likely create new active sites or alter existing ones, leading to improved catalytic performance in the oxidative coupling of methane. The exact nature and location of these active centers are not specified, but they appear to promote C-C bond formation and C-H bond activation.

The study implies that such surface modifications could be applied to improve industrially relevant reactions, particularly in the conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons. However, the effects vary significantly depending on the specific metal oxide used, indicating that the interaction between the chlorine species and the oxide surface is complex and catalyst-dependent.

While this approach differs from traditional substitutional cation doping, it demonstrates how surface modifications can significantly enhance catalytic activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的阳离子掺杂替代。然而，它确实讨论了向各种以二氧化硅为载体的金属氧化物催化剂的进料流中添加四氯化碳（CCl4）的效果。这种CCl4的添加可以被视为一种影响催化活性的表面修饰形式。

CCl4的存在显著增强了C2烃的形成，特别是对于以二氧化硅为载体的Ba、Cs和Mn氧化物。这表明含氯物种改变了催化剂表面，可能改变了其酸度/碱度，将氯掺入氧化物结构中，或形成金属-氯键。

这些修饰可能创造了新的活性位点或改变了现有的活性位点，从而提高了甲烷氧化偶联反应的催化性能。虽然未指明这些活性中心的确切性质和位置，但它们似乎促进了C-C键的形成和C-H键的活化。

该研究暗示这种表面修饰可以应用于改善工业相关反应，特别是在将甲烷转化为更高碳氢化合物的过程中。然而，效果因所使用的特定金属氧化物而异，这表明氯物种与氧化物表面之间的相互作用是复杂的，并且依赖于催化剂。

虽然这种方法与传统的阳离子掺杂替代不同，但它展示了表面修饰如何能显著提高非均相催化中的催化活性和选择性。
