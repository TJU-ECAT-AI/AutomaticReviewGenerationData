[1] "Although the addition of chlorine or chloromethanes to the feed stream is well documented to have a positive influence on many catalytic processes particularly on the selective oxidation of ethylene [12] and in hydrocarbon reforming processes [13], very little is known on the effects of these additives in methane conversion processes."

[2] "In our recent studies [16-18] on the conversion of methane by nitrous oxide on silica supported heteropoly oxometalates, it was shown that the addition of a small quantity of dichloro- or tetrachloromethane to the feed stream has a profound influence on the conversion of methane and selectivities to different products."

[3] "It is evident that the manner in which the oxidation process is affected by the presence of CC14 depends very much on the nature of the oxide used."

[4] "The observed effects may, among others, depend upon the manner in which the acidity and/or basicity of the oxide surface is altered by CC14, whether chlorine is incorporated into or retained by oxide, the strength of the metal-chlorine bond if it is formed at all and the ability of the oxide surface to decompose CC14 and form C1 atoms or radicals."

The literature does not directly address substitutional cation doping in metal oxide catalysts. However, it does discuss the effects of adding chloromethanes like CCl4 to the feed stream in methane conversion processes. The addition of these compounds can significantly influence catalytic activity and selectivity, depending on the nature of the oxide catalyst used. 

The effects may involve alterations to surface acidity/basicity, incorporation of chlorine into the oxide, formation of metal-chlorine bonds, or decomposition of CCl4 to form chlorine atoms/radicals on the catalyst surface. These mechanisms could potentially modify surface chemistry and disrupt chemical bonding in ways that enhance catalytic activity or create new active centers.

While not explicitly about cation doping, these findings suggest that introducing chlorine-containing species can substantially modify oxide catalyst surfaces and catalytic properties. This may have implications for improving industrially relevant reactions like methane conversion, though more research would be needed to fully understand the mechanisms and optimize performance.

该文献并未直接讨论金属氧化物催化剂中的取代阳离子掺杂。然而，它确实讨论了在甲烷转化过程中向进料中添加四氯化碳等氯甲烷的影响。这些化合物的添加可以显著影响催化活性和选择性，具体取决于所使用的氧化物催化剂的性质。

这些效果可能涉及表面酸度/碱度的改变、氯的掺入氧化物、金属-氯键的形成，或CCl4在催化剂表面分解形成氯原子/自由基。这些机制可能会以增强催化活性或创造新的活性中心的方式修改表面化学性质并干扰化学键合。

虽然没有明确涉及阳离子掺杂，但这些发现表明，引入含氯物质可以显著改变氧化物催化剂表面和催化性能。这可能对改进甲烷转化等工业相关反应有启示，尽管还需要更多研究来充分理解其机理并优化性能。
