Metal supported oxide nanostructures are discussed within the framework of the inverse model catalyst concept. We show that
oxide nanostructures on metal surfaces may be regarded as artificial oxide materials, which display novel properties as compared to
bulk oxide compounds and are stabilised by interfacial interactions and two-dimensional confinement effects. This is illustrated for
prototypical examples of vanadium oxide overlayers on Rh(111) and Pd(111) surfaces. Structure and morphological changes of the
oxide phase on V-oxide/Rh and V-oxide/Pd inverse catalyst surfaces are discussed, and the mass transport problem in catalyst systems
during oxidation-reduction cycles is addressed. We demonstrate that the diffusion of oxide cluster over the metal surface provides a
effective means of mass transport. The role of metal-oxide interface in determining the oxide nanolayer structure on particular
substrate surfaces is investigated, and interfacial chemistry and interfacial strain effects are identified as important parameters.

1. Introduction
The role of the oxide phase of oxide-supported metal
catalysts in the course of catalytic reactions has been
associated with a number of different effects, amongst
them are: providing a high-area support for the stabili-
sation of the metal phase in the form of small particles;
influencing the metal phase via electronic interactions;
or providing special reaction sites at the metal-oxide
phase boundary [1]. A particularly drastic interaction
phenomenon between the oxide and the metal phase has
been reported in the form of the so-called strong metal
support interaction (SMSI) effect [2,3], in which cata-
lysts containing transition metal oxide supports display
radically altered chemisorption and reaction behaviour
after high temperature reduction treatments. A key
feature of SMSI is the reversibility of the effectthe
catalyst in the SMSI state can be converted back to its
normal state by an oxidising treatment. The origin of the
SMSI effects has been the subject of much debate over a
number of years [4], but consensus of opinion is now in
favour of the so-called encapsulation model, where the
metal particles are covered with a thin layer of oxide in a
reduced oxidation state [5]. The encapsulation of metal
particles by a migrating reduced oxide phase of the
carrier is associated with an interesting materials trans-
port problem across the catalyst surface, which has been
addressed in a recent publication [6], where the wetting
and spreading of a reduced oxide phase across a metal
surface and the subsequent dewetting of the reoxidised
phase has been observed at the atomic level. In all the
cases mentioned above the metal-oxide interface plays a
crucial role in the process, as it also does in the general
reactivity behaviour of oxide-supported metal catalysts.
An interesting approach in the study of the metal-
oxide interface is the concept of the inverse or
inverted catalyst. While real catalysts consist of metal
particles supported by an oxide carrier phase, the
inverse catalyst is a metal surface, preferably a single
crystal surface, which is decorated by oxide nanostruc-
tures. Of course, the inverse catalyst is a model system
which does not occur in practical industrial catalysis,
but it is well suited to address a number of interesting
aspects of the metal-oxide interface at the atomic level.
For example, the promoting character of transition
metal oxide minority phases in the CO and CO2
hydrogenation reaction catalysed by group VIII metals
has been demonstrated on such oxide decorated inverse
catalyst surfaces by the Somorjai group [7,8], and
bonding sites at the oxide-metal interface related to the
Lewis acidity character of the systems have been sug-
gested as the promoting agents. More recently, Hayek
et al. [9] have related the catalytic activity for the CO
hydrogenation reaction with structural and composi-
tional parameters of vanadium oxide and cerium oxi-
deRh inverse catalysts, and Sock et al. [10] have
investigated the adsorption and oxidation of CO on
vanadium oxidePd(111) inverse catalysts to probe
the influence of the metal-oxide phase boundary on
neighbouring metal adsorption sites. The inverse cat-
alyst model system has a number of technical advan-
tages as compared to the real catalyst systems, amongst
them the ability to apply surface science techniques with
atomic precision for their characterisation [10,11].
In this paper we will concentrate on the structural
and electronic characterisation of metal supported oxide

nanostructures as inverse catalyst model systems and on
the related properties of the metal-oxide interface. Spe-
cifically, we will discuss the geometric structure of
vanadium oxide decorated Rh(111) and Pd(111) sur-
faces as probed by scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) and present the local electronic structure of dif-
ferent oxide phases as measured by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy (STS). There is a fundamental interest to
explore the local electronic structure of nanostructured
materials and STS provides the possibility to study the
electronic signature of ultrathin oxide layers and the
metal-oxide interface. For example, the local electronic
information on oxides is important for identifying and
elucidating the role of defect sites on oxide surfaces,
which are the active reaction centres in many oxide
catalysts. We will demonstrate, as a proof of concept,
that the local structural building blocks in complex
oxide phases can be identified by their electronic signa-
ture. In selected cases the spectral structures in STS can
be recognised in the local density of state diagram, but a
number of experimental and theoretical side effects
introduce complications for the direct comparison.
The vanadium oxide phases discussed in this paper
are two-dimensional structures that bear very little
relation to vanadium oxides in the known bulk phases.
They exhibit novel structural properties with particular
vanadium-oxygen coordination spheres and may there-
fore be regarded as artificial oxide materials in low
dimensions that are stabilised by a combination of
electronic and elastic interactions at the oxide-metal
interface.
The following topics will be addressed in this paper.
After a brief mention of experimental and theoretical
techniques and of methods of surface and catalyst
preparation in section 2, the geometry and electronic
structure of selected vanadium oxide-Rh(111) inverse
catalyst surfaces will be presented in section 3.1. In
section 3.2 the reduction of vanadium oxide phases on
Pd(111) and Rh(111) surfaces will be discussed. In this
section the mass transport problem of oxide migration
across a catalyst surface will be addressed. In Section 3.3
the influence of the metal substrate on the structural
properties of the oxide overlayer phases, that is the role
of the metal-oxide interface, in determining the geome-
try of the vanadium oxide phases observed, will be
examined. A brief summary in section 4 will conclude
the paper.
2. Experiment and theory
The
results presented in this paper have been
obtained by a combination of state-of-the-art experi-
mental and theoretical techniques. The STM experi-
ments have been performed in Graz with an Oxford
Instruments variable-temperature STM (VT-STM) sys-
tem as described previously [12]. The STM images have
been recorded at room temperature and at elevated
temperature up to 700 K. High-resolution electron
energy loss spectra (HREELS) have been measured in
Graz with a custom-designed ErEELS 31 system [13].
The HREELS spectroscopy has been employed to probe
the phonon structure of oxide overlayers, which has
been shown to be of particular diagnostic value in
identifying oxide overlayer structures [14]. High-resolu-
tion X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments have
been carried out at beamline I311 at the Swedish syn-
chrotron radiation facility MAX-Lab in Lund, Sweden
[15].
The STS experiments have been performed at the
University of Manchester with a low-temperature STM
system (Omicron) using two different spectroscopy
modes: the constant height mode and the constant cur-
rent mode. In the former the voltage range measured
was 2 V < U < +2 V with a tip setpoint U = 1.5 V,
I = 0.2 nA, whereas in the latter the voltage range was
+1 V < U < +8 V, with current setpoint I = 0.5 nA.
The sample was held at 77 K during the STS measure-
ments.
The DFT calculations were performed using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [16] as
described elsewhere [17]. As shown previously this
method describes the novel surface oxides well.
The
vanadium
oxide
nanostructures
have
been
deposited on to clean Rh(111) and Pd(111) surfaces by
reactive evaporation of submonolayer coverages of V
metal in oxygen atmosphere, typically 2 · 10)7 mbar,
with the substrates held between 520670 K. After
deposition the sample was kept at these conditions for
several minutes and it was subsequently cooled down to
<400 K in oxygen atmosphere to prevent the thermal
reduction of the oxide. The V-oxide overlayers were
subjected to reducing conditions by annealing in vac-
uum or by exposure to a background pressure of H2 at
elevated temperature [17].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry and electronic structure of vanadium
oxideRh(111) inverse catalysts
Vanadium oxide overlayers on Rh(111) are charac-
terised by pronounced polymorphism and the surface
phase diagram of V-oxide on Rh(111) displays a number
of complex oxide phases as a function of temperature
and coverage, in particular at low coverages up to 23
monolayers (ML) [17,18]. For the purpose of illustration
we discuss here a few selected examples of oxide struc-
tures from the submonolayer coverage regime.
Figure 1 illustrates an inverse catalyst surface, on
which the Rh(111) surface has been decorated with
islands of a (7 · 7)R19 vanadium oxide structure.
This surface has been prepared by reactive evaporation

of 0.3 ML V at 520 K. Figure 1(a) shows a large scale
constant current topographic STM image where the
V-oxide islands are randomly distributed, separated by
areas of the bare Rh metal surface which are covered
with a (2 · 1) chemisorbed oxygen layer (as observed as
stripes on the darker contrast areas of the image); the
latter is the result of the oxygen atmosphere during the
oxide preparation procedure. Figure 1(b) shows a high-
resolution STM image of the 7 phase, on which a
regular mesh of atomic-scale maxima and minima is
recognised; the (7 · 7)R19 unit cell is indicated.
However, despite the atomic resolution in the STM
image it is by no means trivial to derive a detailed
atomic picture of this phase, since the chemical nature of
the protrusions in the STM image is not known. The
combination
of
all
the
experimental
evidence
as
obtained from STM, HR-XPS, and HREELS, plus a
substantial effort of DFT calculations was necessary to
derive the structure model of this phase, which is dis-
played in figure 1(c). This structure consists of tetrago-
nal pyramidal O4V = O building blocks, which contain
a V atom in the center, four bridging oxygen atoms in
the basal plane and a double bonded oxygen atom at the
apex (the so-called vanadyl V = O group). The pyra-
mids are connected via their basal oxygen atoms as
shown in figure 1(c), lower left corner, forming a
(7 · 7)R19 unit cell as indicated in the model. The
overall stoichiometry is V3O9 per 7 unit cell (or for-
mally VO3), i.e. it is a highly oxidised vanadium oxide
phase. Note that this stoichiometry is not in conflict
with the highest possible oxidation state of +5 of V
atoms, since the four basal oxygen atoms are connected
to the Rh substrate, which acts as an electron donor
providing charge transfer to the oxide overlayer. DFT
simulated STM images of this structure (not shown, see
Ref. 18) reveal that the vanadyl groups are responsible
for maxima in the STM images.
The STS spectra of the (7 · 7)R19 structure in dI/
dU versus U form are displayed in figure 1(d). The
graph contains the two spectra obtained in constant tip
height mode (left curve) and in constant current mode
(right curve); the latter extends to higher positive volt-
ages which cannot be reached in the constant height
mode because of the exponential increase of the tun-
neling current. The spectra show peaks at around
+1 eV and +2.8 eV in the empty states above the

Fermi energy (U = 0 V), which are characteristic of the
VO5 pyramidal building blocks. The feature with
increasing intensity towards +5 V marks the onset of
the first field emission resonance [19].
Annealing the (7 · 7)R19 vanadium oxide over-
layer at 650750 K in vacuum leads to the formation of
a new oxide structure with a rectangular (5 · 33) unit
cell. This structure is presented in figure 2. The large-
scale STM image of figure 2(a) shows well-ordered oxide
islands with rectangular shapes, elongated along the
principal h110i azimuthal directions of the Rh(111)
substrate. The high-resolution image of figure 2(b)
illustrates the rectangular unit cell, where dark holes and
bright maxima develop a complex contrast pattern. The
synergy of the various experimental and theoretical
methods has allowed us to derive the structure model of
the (5 · 33)-rect phase [17] that is reproduced in fig-
ure 2(c). Accordingly, the structure consists of two types
of building units, the O4V = O tetragonal pyramid and
a planar V6O12 hexagon (see the circle on the figure),
which are linked together as shown in the model to give
the observed rectangular structure. The stoichiometry
per unit cell is V13O21, or formally VO1.6, this oxide
structure is thus more reduced than the 7 phase in
accord with the more reducing preparation conditions.
The local electronic structure of the (5 · 33)-rect
structure in the form of STS spectra is shown in fig-
ure 2(d). Here, the STS spectra in the constant height
mode have been recorded at two different locations, on
top of the VO5 pyramid (lower left curve) and above the
8-fold corner hole of the unit cell (upper left curve). The
STS in constant current mode (right curve in figure 2d)
is less specific to the atomic location, because the tip
retracts from the surface during the ramping of the bias
voltage and the tunneling current thus becomes more
spatially averaged. The spectrum of the vanadyl con-
taining VO5 group shows again the feature at around
+1 V as from the 7 structure (figure 1d), albeit weaker
and more in form of a shoulder, but the planar corner
hole, which is surrounded by three-fold coordinated V
atoms and bridging oxygen atoms, has a spectral feature
at about +0.3 V (see upper spectrum). The constant
current spectrum shows spectral structure at +2.6 V,
similar as on the 7 surface, and two sharp peaks at

higher bias voltage, which are due to the field emission
resonances [19] and of less diagnostic value for struc-
tural details.
Further annealing the (5 · 33)-rect structure to
750800 K leads to the transformation into a (9 · 9)
vanadium oxide phase, which is illustrated in figure 3.
Figure 3(a) shows 500700 A
wide terraces of the Rh
surface decorated with a compact branched oxide phase
with rounded boundary shapes. The high-resolution
STM image of figure 3(b) displays the complex contrast
pattern of this phase, with the (9 · 9) unit cell indicated.
The DFT derived model of the (9 · 9) structure in fig-
ure 3(c) indicates that this structure involves only one
type of building unit, the planar hexagonal ring struc-
ture as marked by the circles on the figure. These
hexagons are connected in a complex way, with 8-fold
and 5-fold ring structures in between, to give the
observed (9 · 9) periodicity. The (9 · 9) unit cell content
is V36O54, which is a V2O3 stoichiometry: the structure
thus contains only V atoms in a formal +3 oxidation
state. The local electronic structure of the (9 · 9) vana-
dium oxide overlayer is displayed in figure 3(d) in form
of the STS spectra of this phase, taken in constant height
(left) and in constant current modes (right). In constant
height mode the spectra have been recorded at two
different locations, above the 8-fold hollow structure
(upper curve) and above a local (2 · 2) arrangement
(lower curve), the latter is indicated on the model by the
dashed lines. The constant height spectrum taken from
above the 8-fold hole has a peak at +0.3 V, in close
agreement to the spectrum from the same structural unit
of the (5 · 33)-rect structure (figure 2d, upper curve).
The spectrum from the (2 · 2) region (lower curve of
figure 3d) is different and does not contain this feature,
confirming the local building block character of the local
density of states. The constant current spectrum has a
broad structure centred at +2 V and two field emission
resonances at +5.4 V and +7 V.
The building block principle of the various vanadium
oxide monolayer structures on Rh(111) and its mani-
festation in the local electronic structure has been out-
lined above. In this context a particularly interesting
observation is the formation of planar vanadium oxide
cluster units which self-assemble under particular kinetic
conditions on the Rh(111) surface [20]. As discussed
further below, these V-oxide clusters play an important
role in the mass transport process across the surface
during reductive transformation of V-oxide overlayers.

surface after deposition of small amounts of V atoms

(<0.1 ML) in 1 · 10)7 mbar oxygen at room tempera-
ture and flashed subsequently to 570 K. The surface is
covered with small objects which upon closer inspection
can be identified as star-like hexagonal units (see insert
of figure 4a). The high-resolution STM image of fig-
ure 4(b) shows the detailed structure of one of these
star-like clusters, which displays six lobes with a three-
fold symmetric contrast modulation and a somewhat
darker contrast in the center. The DFT calculations
have modelled the structure of these clusters in terms of
planar V6O12 oxide molecules, which have well-defined
orientations (as shown in figure 4c) with respect to the
Rh(111) surface. It is notable that planar VxOy clusters
with · >3 are unstable in the gas phase [21] and that the
here observed cluster units are stabilised by the cluster-
Rh interface. The interaction of the V6O12 cluster with
the substrate also mediates the three-fold contrast
symmetry observed in the STM image of figure 4(b).
The electronic structure of the V6O12 clusters has
been probed by STS as shown in figure 4(d). We
emphasise that STS is the only experimental technique
that allows one to measure the electronic states of these
surface supported nano-objects. The STS spectrum has
peaks at +0.6 V, +1.6 V, and +2.7 V, along with field
emission resonance states beyond +5 V. Figure 4(d)
also includes the DFT calculated atom projected density
of states: the green line is for the vanadium atom, the red
line for the oxygen atoms. There is a close correspon-
dence between vanadium and oxygen derived state
densities, which is the result of the strong hybridisation
between V and O atoms in these molecular oxide clus-
ters. The experimental STS structures all coincide
approximately with peaks in the local density of states,
with the V-derived empty states dominant. This may not
seem too surprising, however, it is noted that a similar
comparison between STS and atom-projected DOS is
much less favourable for the other structures discussed
above. The main reason is that, apart from experimental
tip influence, DFT inherent problems, and k-averaging
effects, the maxima in the tunneling current do not
necessarily coincide with peaks in the atom-projected
DOS. The good agreement between STS spectra and
atom-projected DOS peaks for the V6O12 clusters is thus
a particularly favourable case, caused by the strong
mixing of V and O states. The fingerprinting capability
of features in the STS spectra to identify local building
blocks in oxide structures is however well documented in
Figures 1(d)4(d).

3.2. Reduction processes at inverse catalyst surfaces
Oxidation-reduction cycles of catalysts are common
industrial practise to activate or regenerate supported
metal catalysts. In this section we discuss the reduction
of the oxide phase of vanadium oxide-Pd(111) and
vanadium oxideRh(111) inverse catalysts and the
associated morphology changes of the catalyst surfaces
and we will address the mass transport problem that is
connected with these morphology changes.
The STM images of figure 5 illustrate the reduction
of a vanadium oxide-Pd(111) inverse catalyst surface
from a (4 · 4) V5O14 vanadium oxide overlayer (fig-
ure 5a) to a (2 · 2) V2O3 surface oxide (figure 5c) upon
exposure to hydrogen at room temperature [22]. The
(4 · 4) V5O14 oxide (figure 5(a) and (b)) is formed by
reactive evaporation of V in O2 on to the clean Pd(111)
surface. V5O14 is a highly oxidised phase with the V
atoms in a formal oxidation state close to +5, which has
a peculiar open network structure where tetrahedral
VO coordination units surround 6 uncovered Pd atoms
with a corral of vanadium-oxygen atoms (see fig-
ure 10(b) for the DFT derived model of the (4 · 4)
Figure 5. (a) Large-scale ((1000 · 1000 A

vanadium oxide structure). Exposure of the V5O14
Pd(111) surface to H2 at room temperature (300 K)
leads to reduction and to the formation of a (2 · 2)
vanadium oxide phase with a fractal-type network
morphology (figure 5c and d). As seen in figure 5(d) the
oxide overlayer is a porous network with irregular
branch structure as a result of the chemical reduction
process, but the branches of the network are internally
ordered into a (2 · 2) mesh; the boundary lines are
however very rough at the atomic scale. This porous
(2 · 2) oxide network can be healed out upon annealing
to 600 K into a compact, well-ordered (2 · 2) oxide
phasesee figure 5(e). The atomically resolved STM
image as shown in figure 5(f) forms the basis for the
DFT-derived model of this structure, which is repro-
duced in figure 10(d): the structure consists of a hon-
eycomb arrangement of V atoms, which are located in
the three-fold hollow sites of the Pd(11) surface and
which are connected by bridging oxygen atoms, the
latter pointing away from the surface (see figure 10d).
The exact geometry of this so-called surface-V2O3
phase [12] has been quantified in previous work by
X-ray photoelectron diffraction and LEED I(V) analysis
[23,24]. Here we will concentrate on the (4 · 4) fi(2 · 2)
reduction. In figure 6 this reduction process has been
followed by XPS and HREELS. In figure 6(a) and (b) O
1s and V 2p3/2 XPS core level spectra, respectively, of
the pristine (4 · 4) V-oxide-Pd(111) surface and after
exposure to 3 L H2 at 300 K are shown. The O 1s core
level peak intensity drops by about 40% after H2
exposure (figure 6a), in accord with the decrease of the
oxygen content in the reduction from VO2.8 (=V5O14)
to VO1.5 (=V2O3). The V 2p3/2 core level peak shifts by
more than 1 eV to lower binding energy (figure 6b),
again a clear indication of the reduction from V+5 to
V+3. The HREELS phonon spectra in figure 6(c) allow
us to follow the evolution from the (4 · 4) V5O14 struc-
ture via the porous (2 · 2) phase into the compact (2 · 2)
surface-V2O3 oxide. The (4 · 4) V-oxide has a complex
phonon signature with peak structures at around
6572 meV, 105 meV, and 115 meV (spectrum A), but
the well-ordered compact (2 · 2) phase is characterised
by a single sharp phonon peak at 68 meV (top spectrum
C of figure 6c). As calculated by DFT this latter phonon

loss peak at 68 meV is due to the dipole allowed
vibration perpendiculat to the surface of the oxygen
sublattice versus the vanadium sublattice [25]. Interest-
ingly, the random network structure of the porous
(2 · 2) phase as obtained directly after reduction (fig-
ure 5c,d) is clearly manifested in the phonon spectrum B
of figure 6(c). The single phonon structure is now
broader and shifted to 62 meV as compared to the one
from the compact (2 · 2) phase. This phonon red-shift is
most naturally interpreted in terms of the large number
of low-coordinated oxygen atoms at the boundaries,
which are in a less stiff inhomogeneous surounding at
the phase boundary of the (2 · 2) network branches. The
latter sites may be more reactive for catalytic oxidation
processes as suggested previously [10].
As a second example of the reduction of inverse
catalysts we present the case of the (7 · 7)R19
vanadium oxide-Rh(111) surface. The reduction of the
(7 · 7)R19 vanadium oxide overlayer has been fol-
lowed during exposure to 1 · 10)9 mbar H2 at 700 K by
VT-STM. Figure 7 gives a sequence of selected STM
images recorded at the same position of the surface after
the indicated reduction times. After 4530 s of H2 expo-
sure the 7 phase is replaced by a (5 · 5) phase (fig-
ure 7b), which is transformed into the (5 · 33)-rect
structure after 6250 s of reduction (figure 7c). After
17350 s the whole oxide overlayer is reduced to the
(9 · 9) vanadium oxide structure. As apparent from
figure 7 the area densities of the various oxide phases are
different and the morphologies change accordingly. It is
thus clear that considerable mass transport across the
surface must take place during this reduction sequence.
Before considering the question of the mass transport
let us briefly comment on the chemical aspect of this
reduction sequence. Figure 8 collects HREELS spectra
of the (7 · 7)R19, the (5 · 33)-rect, and the (9 · 9)
phases, whose structures have been discussed in section
3.1. Accordingly, the 7 phase contains tetragonal
O4V = O pyramidal building blocks, the (5 · 33)-rect
the same tetragonal pyramids plus planar hexagonal
VO rings, whereas the (9 · 9) structure contains the
hexagonal VO rings only. In simplified terms, the 7
structure may be regarded as a V5+ oxide, the (5 · 33)-
rect as a mixed V5+ and V3+ oxide, and the (9 · 9) phase
as a V3+ oxide. The (5 · 5) phase of figure 7(b), which
has not been treated explicitely here, is also a mixed
V5+  V3+ vanadium oxide [17]. The phonon spectrum
of the 7 structure displays two phonon losses at
130 meV and 65 meV, which in a simple picture may be
associated with the stretching vibrations of the vanadyl
V = O group (130 meV) and with vibrations involving
the bridging O atoms (65 meV). Upon reduction to the
(5 · 33)-rect phase the vanadyl species are still present
albeit with lower concentration, and this is borne out by
the corresponding phonon peak intensity at 130 meV of
the (5 · 33)-rect spectrum (figure 8, middle curve). The
(9 · 9) structure contains no vanadyl groups and the
phonon spectrum is clear of this peak and displays only
features associated with vibrations of the bridging oxy-
gen groups. One principal aspect of the reduction of the
7 vanadium oxide is thus the gradual removal of van-
adyl V = O groups. A second aspect is of course the
formation and rearrangement of the planar, hexagonal
VO ring like structures.
Closer inspection of the STM images of figure 7(b)
and (c) reveals that the metal areas in between the oxide
phase appear to display a lot of fuzziness and noise, if
one compares it with the images 7(a) or (d). This noise is
not due to tip instabilities as apparent from the rela-
tively well-resolved structures on the oxide islands, but it
is due to rapidly moving particles that form at the sur-
face during the reduction process. The STM images
shown in figure 7(e) and (f) correspond to the situation
in images 7(b) and (c), but they have been recorded after
cooling the respective surfaces down to room tempera-
ture. Here, the particles that move at elevated temper-
ature can be identified as the star-like V6O12 clusters:
they develop by evaporation during the reduction of the
(5 · 5) phase and recondense into the (5 · 33)-rect
structuresee images 7(e) and (f). The physical origin of
this evaporation-condensation process of V6O12 clusters
can be understood quantitatively with the help of a DFT
derived vanadium oxideRh(111) phase stability dia-
gram, where the (5 · 5), the V6O12, and the (5 · 33)-rect
phases occupy a region of coexistence at the appropriate
chemical potential of oxygen [26]. To put in more simple
terms, the (5 · 5) structure corresponds to a VO2.09, the
V6O12 to VO2, and the (5 · 33)-rect to a VO1.6 stoi-
chiometry. The gradient in the chemical potential of
oxygen during reduction thus provides the driving force
for a reaction pathway from VO2.09 to VO1.6, leading to
the evaporation of the VO2  V6O12 stars from the
VO2.09(5 · 5) islands, and to the re-condensation of the
VO2 stars into the VO1.6(5 · 33)-rect island structure.
The V6O12 clusters become mobile at T>370 K and
diffuse rapidly over the surface as entire cluster units as
shown previously in a detailed diffusion study [20]. This
cluster diffusion provides a convenient means of mass
transport across the metal surface for the oxide material.
We thus propose that the mass transport on metal-oxide
catalysts, which can lead to massive morphology chan-
ges during oxidation-reduction cycles, may be caused by
the
diffusion
of
oxide
nanoclusters
that
form
intermediary under the red-ox conditions.
We conclude this section by discussing another aspect
of the morphology changes that we have observed
during red-ox cycling of vanadium oxideRh(111)
inverse catalysts. The 0.25 ML V-oxideRh(111) sur-
face shown in figure 9(a), prepared by reactive evapo-
ration of V in 2 · 10)7 mbar O2 at 520 K, consists of
irregularly shaped islands of the (7 · 7)R19 phase. In
order to quantify the shape of the oxide islands we have
introduced a shape form factor S, which is the ratio
S = {4p · area/(boundary
line)2}
[27].

circular islands S = 1. The 7 V-oxide phase in fig-
ure 9(a) has a form factor S = 0.24, and thus contains
long boundary lines with many undercoordinated atoms
at the metal-oxide phase boundary. To mimic the red-ox
cycling of catalysts, the surface of figure 9(a) has been
subjected to 2 · 10)7 mbar H2 at 520 K for 5 min, fol-
lowed by 2 · 10)7 O2 at 520 K for 5 min. After cooling
down to 300 K in O2 , the STM images 9(b) and (c) have
been measured after one and two red-ox cycles, respec-
tively. After the first cycle the oxide islands grow in size
as reflected by S = 0.48, and after the second cycle a
more compact morphology has developed with S =
0.56. Thus, consecutive red-ox treatments of the inverse
catalyst lead to the growth of oxide islands with mor-
phologies characterised by high form factors, that is
with island shapes that have lower surface to boundary
ratios than freshly prepared surfaces. Inverse catalysts
with oxide islands displaying small form factors are
more active in oxidation reactions, e.g. in promoting the
oxidation

oxide-metal surfaces with high form factors [27]: the red-
ox cycling leads therefore to the passivation of the
inverse catalyst in this case.
The examples discussed in this section cannot and
should not be taken as representative of all kinds of
catalysts, but they do give insight into the morphology
phenomena and atomic processes during mass transport
that may also occur on real catalysts under more real-
istic conditions than employed in this model study.
3.3. The metal-oxide interface
The vanadium oxide nanostructures prepared by
reactive evaporation on to Rh(111) and Pd(111) under
relatively high chemical potentials of oxygen are char-
acterised on both nobel metal surfaces by V atoms in a
high oxidation state, i.e. of or close to +5. However, the
resulting geometric structures of the phases are very
different: a (7 · 7)R19 structure on Rh(111) and a
(4 · 4) structure on Pd(111), with different VO coordi-
nation units and somewhat different stoichiometries.
The question we wish to address here is why do these
different structures form on the two metals one would
expect to behave similarly. A quantitative analysis
involving detailed DFT model calculations is beyond the
scope of this paper, but some insight may be gained by a
qualitative discussion considering the elastic effects and
the chemistry at the interface. The 7 and (4 · 4) phases
have rather open network structures as shown by the
direct comparison of the models in figure 10(a) and (b),
and the difference in the surface lattice constants
between Rh(111) and Pd(111) is not very large (aPd =
2.75 A
 , aRh = 2.69 A
 , difference 2.2% ). This would
argue against elastic strain effects being responsible for
the differences between Rh and Pd for these oxide
structures, leaving the interfacial chemistry for further
consideration. We notice that the (4 · 4) V-oxide on
Pd(111) contains somewhat less oxygen than the 7
phase on Rh(111) (VO2.8 versus VO3, respectively), but
closer inspection of the structures also reveals that the
(4 · 4) phase has less metal-oxygen bonding at the
interface. The (4 · 4) network is made up by tetrahedral
VO building blocks, which interact with the Pd(111)
surface alternatingly with one and two oxygen atoms: at
the corners of the hexagon displayed in figure 10(b) one
oxygen atom is at the interface (not seen), whereas for
the tetrahedra at the sides of the hexagon two oxygen
atoms are bonded to Pd surface atoms. The 7 structure
is assembled by O4V = O tetragonal pyramids which
are bonded to the Rh surface atoms via their four basal
oxygen atoms, as indicated in figure 10(a). It is known
that Rh has a higher affinity to oxygen than Pd [28]. We

therefore suggest that the higher affinity of Rh towards
oxygen is at the root of the structural differences of the
highly oxidised vanadium oxide nanostructures between
Rh(111) and Pd(111) substrate surfaces.
Another interesting example of different oxide struc-
tures formed on Rh(111) and Pd(111) substrates con-
cerns the more reduced V2O3type phases. We recall
that on the Pd(111) surface a (2 · 2) surface-V2O3 phase
has been observed after reduction of the (4 · 4) V-oxide
(see figure 5), whereas on Rh(111) a (9 · 9) V-oxide
overlayer, also of V2O3 overall stoichiometry, has been
obtained by reduction of the 7 phase (figure 7). The
DFT models of these two V2O3 phases are compared
directly in figure 10(c) and (d). The V2O3 structure of
figure 10(d) forms a honeycomb lattice of VO hexa-
gons with favourable VO bonding distances [12] that fit
exactly onto a (2 · 2) lattice on Pd(111). The (9 · 9)
structure on Rh(111) also has VO hexagons as building
blocks (encircled on figure 10c). However, as a result of
the smaller Rh lattice constant, these hexagons do not fit
onto a (2 · 2) lattice, unless considerable lattice strain is
build up. The (9 · 9) structure contains smaller regions
of local (2 · 2) symmetry (figure 3c), but these are con-
nected in a complicated way via the larger 8-fold ring
structures in order to release the interfacial strain. We
propose therefore that the complex (9 · 9) V2O3type
phase on Rh(111) is the result of interfacial strain
effects. Support for this conjecture has been obtained
very recently by growth experiments of V-oxide on vic-
inal Rh(111) surfaces, where the (9 · 9) structure has
been found on wide Rh(111) terraces, but a (2 · 2)
structure was observed on small terraces, where the step
edges may provide the strain relief [29].
4. Conclusions
In this article the use of metal supported oxide
nanostructures as model systems for advanced catalysis
has been illustrated. Nobel metal single crystal surfaces,
specifically Rh(111) and Pd(111), have been decorated
by submonolayer quantities of vanadium oxides and the
resulting surfaces have been discussed within the con-
cept of the inverse catalyst model system. It is shown
that oxide overlayers in the ultrathin film limit (socalled
oxide nanolayers) constitute novel materials which
have different properties as compared to their respective
bulk counterparts. In a way, oxide nanolayers may be

regarded as artificial materials that are stabilised by the
interactions at the interface to the metal support and by
their two-dimensional character. Prototypical examples
of oxide nanolayers have been selected from the
Rh(111)-vanadium oxide surface phase diagram and it is
shown that both geometry and local electronic structure
can be analysed within a building block approach of
VO coordination units. The VO building blocks
encountered in the vanadium oxide nanolayers, how-
ever, are different from the ones which are present in the
well-known vanadium oxide bulk phases.

the interfacial chemistry together with lattice mismatch
strain effects at the interface have been identified as
important parameters.
