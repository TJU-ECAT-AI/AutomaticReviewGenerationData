          "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride using a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

          "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is commercialized by using a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst"

          "There is evidence suggesting that improved activity and selectivity for various metal-catalyzed oxidation processes can be achieved by coupling redox-active metal centers with redox-active POMs."

          "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

          "Figure 6 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

          The literature provides some relevant information about heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, particularly focusing on the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is commercialized using specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts. The catalytic system involves a circulating fluidized bed reactor where the catalyst contacts butane in a riser reactor and is then reoxidized in a separate regeneration reactor. This approach achieves a 10-15% improvement in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to conventional fixed bed reactors using air, by operating in an anaerobic environment.

          The document suggests that the activity and selectivity of metal-catalyzed oxidation processes can be improved by coupling redox-active metal centers with redox-active polyoxometalates (POMs). For supported metal oxide catalysts, it has been observed that increasing the basicity of the support decreases the decline in olefin selectivity as alkane conversion increases.

          The phosphorus to vanadium ratio in supported vanadium phosphate catalysts affects the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation from butane oxidation. This demonstrates how catalyst composition can be tuned to improve selectivity in alkane oxidation reactions.

          However, the literature does not provide specific details about the mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, nor does it explicitly discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction processes as requested in the question. While the document touches on some aspects of heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, it lacks the detailed mechanistic discussion needed to fully address the question as posed.

          文献提供了一些关于烷烃氧化多相催化的相关信息，特别关注了丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。这个过程在商业上使用特制的钒焦磷酸盐催化剂。催化系统涉及循环流化床反应器，其中催化剂在提升管反应器中与丁烷接触，然后在单独的再生反应器中重新氧化。与使用空气的常规固定床反应器相比，这种方法在无氧环境下操作，使顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性提高了10-15%。

          文献表明，通过将氧化还原活性金属中心与氧化还原活性多金属氧酸盐（POMs）结合，可以提高金属催化氧化过程的活性和选择性。对于负载型金属氧化物催化剂，观察到随着载体碱性的增加，烯烃选择性随烷烃转化率增加而下降的趋势减弱。

          在负载型钒磷酸盐催化剂中，磷与钒的比例影响丁烷氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性。这个例子展示了如何通过调整催化剂组成来提高烷烃氧化反应的选择性。

          然而，文献没有提供关于氧化物材料上孤立金属中心活化C-H键的具体机理细节，也没有明确讨论问题中要求的Mars van Krevelen机制或H-抽提过程。虽然文献涉及了烷烃氧化多相催化的一些方面，但缺乏详细的机理讨论，无法完全回答所提出的问题。
