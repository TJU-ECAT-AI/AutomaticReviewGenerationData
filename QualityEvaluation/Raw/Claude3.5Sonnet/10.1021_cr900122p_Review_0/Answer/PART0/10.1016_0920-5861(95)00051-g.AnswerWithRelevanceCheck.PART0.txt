          [1] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]."

[2] "Mg3(VO4): (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[3] "The active sites are assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions improve the selectivity."

          Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Redox cycling: As seen in vanadium oxide-based systems, the metal center undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle.

2. Selective activation: Isolated VO4 units in Mg3(VO4)2 catalysts spread over MgO are highly active and selective for n-butane oxydehydrogenation. These isolated units prevent over-oxidation by not inserting oxygen into activated hydrocarbons, thus avoiding the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that lead to COx.

3. Synergistic effects: In mixed metal oxide catalysts like V/Nb/O, vanadium ions in small clusters act as active sites, while neighboring surface Nb ions improve selectivity.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is implied through the redox cycle description, and H-abstraction is likely involved in C-H activation, these are not explicitly discussed in the given text.

The principles of isolated active sites and redox mechanisms are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. However, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not addressed in the provided information.

The key in catalyst design is to balance isolated active sites for selective C-H bond activation while preventing over-oxidation. The oxide support and promoters play crucial roles in tuning this selectivity.

          氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 氧化还原循环：如钒氧化物基系统所示，金属中心在催化循环过程中经历还原和再氧化。

2. 选择性活化：分散在MgO上的Mg3(VO4)2催化剂中的孤立VO4单元对正丁烷氧化脱氢具有高活性和选择性。这些孤立单元通过不向活化的碳氢化合物插入氧来防止过度氧化，从而避免形成导致COx的含氧碳氢化合物。

3. 协同效应：在V/Nb/O等混合金属氧化物催化剂中，小簇形式的钒离子作为活性位点，而相邻的表面Nb离子提高选择性。

虽然Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧化还原循环描述暗示，且H-抽取可能涉及C-H活化，但这些在给定文本中并未明确讨论。

孤立活性位点和氧化还原机制的原理应用于烷烃的工业选择性氧化。然而，所提供的信息中并未涉及丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。

催化剂设计的关键在于平衡孤立活性位点以实现选择性C-H键活化，同时防止过度氧化。氧化物载体和助剂在调节这种选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。
