          [1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "It is probable that CH bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates."

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."

          Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Formation of organometallic intermediates: Isolated metal centers can interact with alkanes and aromatics to form organometallic species, which are key intermediates in the C-H activation process.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bonds can be activated through heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites, such as GaO-S in gallium oxide.

3. H-abstraction: This mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen by reactive oxygen sites on the oxide surface, resulting in the formation of adsorbed alkyl radical intermediates.

The main mechanisms involved in these processes are:

1. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide, followed by the reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen. It is commonly observed in selective oxidation reactions.

2. H-abstraction: Surface oxygen species abstract hydrogen from the alkane, forming radical intermediates that undergo further transformations.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to achieve high selectivity and efficiency. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example:

1. The process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst, which provides isolated metal centers for C-H activation.

2. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.

3. The most accepted mechanism involves a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by V(IV)O species, converting butane into 2-butenes.

4. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

5. The process achieves high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion) and is commercially viable.

This example demonstrates how understanding and applying C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers can lead to the development of efficient and selective industrial processes for the conversion of alkanes to valuable products.

          氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 形成有机金属中间体：孤立的金属中心可以与烷烃和芳烃相互作用，形成关键的有机金属中间体，这些中间体在C-H活化过程中起重要作用。

2. 异裂：C-H键可以在高度活性的金属-氧位点上通过异裂方式被活化，例如氧化镓中的GaO-S。

3. 氢抽提：这种机制涉及氧化物表面上的活性氧位点对氢的抽提，导致吸附的烷基自由基中间体的形成。

这些过程中涉及的主要机制有：

1. Mars van Krevelen机制：这涉及金属氧化物对烷烃的氧化，随后分子氧对固体的再氧化。这在选择性氧化反应中常见。

2. 氢抽提：表面氧物种从烷烃中抽提氢，形成自由基中间体，进而发生进一步转化。

在工业烷烃选择性氧化中，这些原理被应用于实现高选择性和高效率。丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐是一个典型的例子：

1. 该过程使用钒磷酸盐（VPO）作为催化剂，提供C-H活化的孤立金属中心。

2. 反应的速率决定步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化。

3. 最广为接受的机制涉及V(IV)O物种对两个氢原子的协同抽提，将丁烷转化为2-丁烯。

4. 随后是分子氧对活性相的再氧化，符合Mars van Krevelen机制。

5. 该过程实现了高选择性（在65%转化率下可达97%）并具有商业可行性。

这个例子展示了如何理解和应用孤立金属中心上的C-H活化机制，从而开发出高效、选择性的工业过程，将烷烃转化为有价值的产品。
