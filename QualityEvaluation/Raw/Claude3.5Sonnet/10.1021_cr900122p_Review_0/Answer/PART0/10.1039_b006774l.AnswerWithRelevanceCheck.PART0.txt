          "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

"The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

"All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

"For the aluminiumalkyl pathway, eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."

          The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum, on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum (Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4) inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (e.g., propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process differs from previously assumed mechanisms involving hydron transfer or carbocation intermediates.

The mechanism consists of the following steps:
1. Propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites.
2. Aluminum inserts into a C-H bond (primary C-H bonds are more reactive than secondary ones).
3. Hydrogen migrates from aluminum to an oxygen atom.
4. The chemisorption products further react to form hydrogen and an alkene (propene), which remain complexed with the aluminum cluster.

This study challenges previous assumptions that such reactions were solely due to acid-base catalysis, showing that metal ion catalysis by aluminum can play an important role in C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes (including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride), the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers could potentially be applied to improve understanding and design of catalysts for such processes.

          文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，如何在多相催化中促进C-H键的活化。该机制涉及金属离子催化，其中配位不饱和的铝（Al(O)n位点，其中n = 3和4）插入烷烃（如丙烷）的C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程与之前假设的涉及质子转移或碳正离子中间体的机制不同。

该机制包括以下步骤：
1. 丙烷加到配位不饱和的铝位点上。
2. 铝插入C-H键中（伯C-H键比仲C-H键更具反应性）。
3. 氢从铝迁移到氧原子上。
4. 化学吸附产物进一步反应形成氢气和烯烃（丙烯），它们与铝簇保持络合状态。

这项研究挑战了先前认为此类反应仅由酸碱催化引起的假设，表明铝的金属离子催化在氧化物表面的C-H键活化中可以发挥重要作用。

虽然文献没有具体讨论Mars van Krevelen机制、H-抽提或烷烃的工业选择性氧化（包括丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程），但对孤立金属中心上C-H活化机制的见解可能有助于改进对此类过程的催化剂理解和设计。
