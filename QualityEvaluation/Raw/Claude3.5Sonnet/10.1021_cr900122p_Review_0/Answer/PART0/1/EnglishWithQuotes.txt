A partial degree of reduction and a cubic crystalline structure are essential for superior catalyst performance.\n4. Both bulk oxygen ions (limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species are involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane.\n5. The reaction likely begins with C-H activation on the catalyst surface, followed by further reactions that may involve both surface and gas-phase steps.\n\nThis approach allows for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride while minimizing complete combustion to CO2. The catalyst's ability to provide oxygen for insertion into the hydrocarbon while maintaining selectivity is key to the reaction's success.", "Doi": "10.1016/s0920-5861(99)00041-3"},
