"It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

"In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer."

"Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

"For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane."

"Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

"The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis."

[1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "It is probable that CH bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates."

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."

"Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

"The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

"All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

"For the aluminiumalkyl pathway, eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."

[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[3] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[4] "A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported in Table 2."

[5] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

[6] "A peculiarity of the catalyst is that no support has been used. The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters, (2) embedding the precursor with Zr and Ti pyrophosphate in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."

[7] "How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"

[8] "What is the mechanism of activation of the paraffin, abstraction of w, of H-, of H, or H+' donation?"

[9] "Is the selectivity also related to the mechanism of activation?"

[10] "None of these intermediates is observed among the reaction products under usual reaction conditions. This raises a doubt about the validity of the proposed mechanism; however, the absence of intermediate products can be justified simply by kinetic reasons."

[1] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]."

[2] "Mg3(VO4): (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[3] "The active sites are assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions improve the selectivity."

"The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride using a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

          "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is commercialized by using a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst"

          "There is evidence suggesting that improved activity and selectivity for various metal-catalyzed oxidation processes can be achieved by coupling redox-active metal centers with redox-active POMs."

          "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

          "Figure 6 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

"The manner in which hydrogen is activated by alumina and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood. By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."

"Since methane is readily deuterated over alumina, it may be supposed that the molecule is cleaved as it is chemisorbed. If it reacted with the dual acid-base surface sites in a manner analogous to NH3 and H2O, then Al-CH3 and adjacent OH groups would be formed."

"These equations indicate ways in which hydrocarbons may dissociate and adsorb, but they offer no insight into the mechanism of hydrogen exchange with catalyst deuteroxyl groups."

"It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."

"Evidently, on silica-alumina, the sites are not the same as on alumina; they appear to be weaker. Consequently, much higher temperatures are required to activate the methane molecule."

"With alumina, the methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion with concomitant formation of a hydroxyl group"

"The catalyst was thermostated to ±0.5° by an automatically controlled electric furnace above 100° and by liquid baths below this temperature."

"As the surface hydroxyl groups are mobile at this temperature, all of the catalyst hydrogen was available for exchange."

"It was found that the reaction was catalyzed by a small number (~5 X 1012/cm.2) of active sites and involved exchange with only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups."

"Over alumina, mixing took place at a readily measurable rate at room temperature with an activation energy of 5.7 kcal./mole."

"A model was derived to describe our results. Assuming that only one hydrogen (deuterium) atom is exchanged per interaction with the catalyst, and that the available OD is large compared with methane, the following reactions may be written"

[1] "A theoretical approach to the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides has been performed by means of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations."

          [2] "Transition-state structures correspond to a four-center interaction with an energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol. This high activation barrier supports the heterolytic mechanism proposed for this reaction."

          [3] "The products are methyl-metal compounds, CH3-Me (Me = Al, La), with the carbon atom negatively charged."

          [4] "Transition states and products for the heterolytic chemisorption of CH4 on Al(OH)3 and La(OH)3 molecules have been determined at the RHF-SCF level of theory."

"the mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity)"

"The oxidation of n-butane and n-pentane over vanadyl pyrophosphate [...] In general, the fundamental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 as the active phase is recognized but it is generally believed that oxidized V5+ sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride."

"Since these compounds lack bulk-O-insertion properties, they are not used when the reaction is aimed at the production of oxygenates."

"In the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, the two essential requirements for catalysts of superior performance are: (i) a partial degree of reduction, and (ii) a cubic crystalline structure."
