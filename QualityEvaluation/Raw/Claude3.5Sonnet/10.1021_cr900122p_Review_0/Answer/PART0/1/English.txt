Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms, primarily the Mars van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism involves cooperation between acid-base and redox sites on the catalyst surface and consists of the following key steps:

1. Activation of the substrate on a metal cation acting as a Lewis acid site
2. Insertion of oxygen from the lattice 
3. A redox process at the metal site involving electron transfer

The metal centers can facilitate oxidation reactions in three general ways:
1. Single electron abstraction from an electron-rich molecule
2. Acting as part of a catalytic center that includes Lewis acid, Lewis base, and redox-active metal sites
3. Forming acid-base adducts with the substrate or oxidizing agent to enhance reactivity

In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface O= or OH- species act as basic sites, while metallic cations serve as Lewis acid sites. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer during this process.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which occurs on vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts. This reaction is believed to take place specifically on the (1,0,0) crystal face, where the spatial arrangement of atoms facilitates interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane.

Other industrial applications using similar principles include:
- Oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates
- Propane dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism allows for selective oxidation by controlling the reaction through the catalyst's surface properties and structure. This enables the transformation of alkanes into more valuable oxidized products under controlled conditions.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Formation of organometallic intermediates: Isolated metal centers can interact with alkanes and aromatics to form organometallic species, which are key intermediates in the C-H activation process.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bonds can be activated through heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites, such as GaO-S in gallium oxide.

3. H-abstraction: This mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen by reactive oxygen sites on the oxide surface, resulting in the formation of adsorbed alkyl radical intermediates.

The main mechanisms involved in these processes are:

1. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide, followed by the reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen. It is commonly observed in selective oxidation reactions.

2. H-abstraction: Surface oxygen species abstract hydrogen from the alkane, forming radical intermediates that undergo further transformations.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to achieve high selectivity and efficiency. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example:

1. The process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst, which provides isolated metal centers for C-H activation.

2. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.

3. The most accepted mechanism involves a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by V(IV)O species, converting butane into 2-butenes.

4. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

5. The process achieves high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion) and is commercially viable.

This example demonstrates how understanding and applying C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers can lead to the development of efficient and selective industrial processes for the conversion of alkanes to valuable products.

The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum, on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum (Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4) inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (e.g., propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process differs from previously assumed mechanisms involving hydron transfer or carbocation intermediates.

The mechanism consists of the following steps:
1. Propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites.
2. Aluminum inserts into a C-H bond (primary C-H bonds are more reactive than secondary ones).
3. Hydrogen migrates from aluminum to an oxygen atom.
4. The chemisorption products further react to form hydrogen and an alkene (propene), which remain complexed with the aluminum cluster.

This study challenges previous assumptions that such reactions were solely due to acid-base catalysis, showing that metal ion catalysis by aluminum can play an important role in C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes (including the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride), the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers could potentially be applied to improve understanding and design of catalysts for such processes.

The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a key industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst in fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors.

The mechanism likely involves both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, though the exact details are not fully elucidated in the given text. The reaction is believed to proceed through several intermediates, but these are not typically observed due to kinetic factors. The initial C-H bond activation of butane is the rate-determining step.

Key factors influencing catalyst performance include the preparation method, phosphorus to vanadium (P/V) ratio, presence of additives, and activation/conditioning procedures. These parameters affect the catalyst structure and surface properties, which in turn impact its ability to selectively activate C-H bonds.

The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst demonstrates remarkable selectivity in converting butane directly to maleic anhydride without producing significant amounts of intermediate products. This highlights the catalyst's ability to efficiently perform multiple oxidation steps once the initial C-H activation occurs.

A unique feature of this catalyst is that it's unsupported, with mechanical strength developed through special treatments, addition of promoters, or encapsulation techniques.

While the exact mechanism of paraffin activation (whether it involves abstraction of H-, H, or H+ donation) and its relation to selectivity remain open questions, the industrial success of this process demonstrates how isolated metal centers on oxide supports can be leveraged for selective alkane oxidation through careful catalyst design and reaction engineering.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Redox cycling: As seen in vanadium oxide-based systems, the metal center undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle.

2. Selective activation: Isolated VO4 units in Mg3(VO4)2 catalysts spread over MgO are highly active and selective for n-butane oxydehydrogenation. These isolated units prevent over-oxidation by not inserting oxygen into activated hydrocarbons, thus avoiding the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that lead to COx.

3. Synergistic effects: In mixed metal oxide catalysts like V/Nb/O, vanadium ions in small clusters act as active sites, while neighboring surface Nb ions improve selectivity.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is implied through the redox cycle description, and H-abstraction is likely involved in C-H activation, these are not explicitly discussed in the given text.

The principles of isolated active sites and redox mechanisms are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. However, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not addressed in the provided information.

The key in catalyst design is to balance isolated active sites for selective C-H bond activation while preventing over-oxidation. The oxide support and promoters play crucial roles in tuning this selectivity.

The literature provides some relevant information about heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, particularly focusing on the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This process is commercialized using specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts. The catalytic system involves a circulating fluidized bed reactor where the catalyst contacts butane in a riser reactor and is then reoxidized in a separate regeneration reactor. This approach achieves a 10-15% improvement in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to conventional fixed bed reactors using air, by operating in an anaerobic environment.

          The document suggests that the activity and selectivity of metal-catalyzed oxidation processes can be improved by coupling redox-active metal centers with redox-active polyoxometalates (POMs). For supported metal oxide catalysts, it has been observed that increasing the basicity of the support decreases the decline in olefin selectivity as alkane conversion increases.

          The phosphorus to vanadium ratio in supported vanadium phosphate catalysts affects the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation from butane oxidation. This demonstrates how catalyst composition can be tuned to improve selectivity in alkane oxidation reactions.

          However, the literature does not provide specific details about the mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, nor does it explicitly discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction processes as requested in the question. While the document touches on some aspects of heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, it lacks the detailed mechanistic discussion needed to fully address the question as posed.

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or the industrial application to selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some insights into C-H bond activation on alumina and silica-alumina catalysts:

1. On alumina, C-H bond activation appears to occur at specific active sites, likely involving exposed aluminum ions. The methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion while a hydroxyl group forms.

2. Silica-alumina catalysts have weaker sites than alumina and require higher temperatures to activate methane molecules.

3. The catalytic reaction involves a small number of active sites (~5 x 10^12/cm^2) on the catalyst surface, with only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups participating in the exchange reaction.

4. For alumina, the activation energy for the mixing reaction was found to be 5.7 kcal/mole.

5. The proposed mechanism involves the exchange of one hydrogen (deuterium) atom per interaction with the catalyst.

6. Hydrogen diffusion from distant locations to active sites plays a role in the catalytic process on alumina.

The study focuses more on fundamental aspects of methane exchange reactions rather than selective oxidation processes or specific industrial applications. While these findings provide insights into C-H bond activation on oxide catalysts, they do not specifically address the mechanisms or industrial applications mentioned in the question.

The provided literature does not fully address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials in heterogeneous catalysis, nor does it discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or the industrial application of butane conversion to maleic anhydride. However, it offers some insights into methane activation on Al and La oxide surfaces:

          1. The study uses ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to examine the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides.
          2. The research focuses on heterolytic chemisorption of CH4 on Al(OH)3 and La(OH)3 molecules, which can be considered as simplified models of oxide surfaces.
          3. The transition state involves a four-center interaction with a high energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol, supporting a heterolytic mechanism for the reaction.
          4. The products of this reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La) with a negatively charged carbon atom, suggesting that the metal centers play a role in activating the C-H bond by accepting electrons.
          5. The researchers modeled catalytic surfaces using point charges and ab initio model potentials to account for lattice effects.

          While these findings contribute to understanding C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces, they do not directly address the specific mechanisms or industrial applications mentioned in the question.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: The density and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface is crucial. Isolated metal centers provide specific adsorption sites for reactants and control the selectivity of the reaction, favoring selective oxidation over combustion.

2. Redox properties: The oxidation state of transition metal ions in the catalyst is dynamic and interacts with the gas phase. This allows for controlled oxidation and reduction cycles. The reducibility and re-oxidizability of the active sites, as well as the metal-oxygen bond strength, play key roles in C-H activation.

3. Oxygen species: Both adsorbed oxygen species and lattice oxygen (bulk oxygen ions) on the isolated metal centers play crucial roles in C-H bond activation and subsequent oxidation steps.

4. Heterogeneous mechanism: The reaction typically involves the formation of intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species on the catalyst surface, occurring preferentially at lower temperatures.

5. Structural effects: Defects in the catalyst structure can favor the mobility of ionic species in the bulk, potentially aiding C-H activation.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are involved in these processes:

1. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the oxide participates in the reaction, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst. This is particularly important for reactions aimed at producing oxygenates.

2. H-abstraction: Metal centers can abstract hydrogen from alkanes to form alkyl radicals.

In the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are applied using vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) catalysts:

1. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous radical processes play important roles.
2. Oxidized V5+ sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases or domains on (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in maleic anhydride formation.
3. A partial degree of reduction and a cubic crystalline structure are essential for superior catalyst performance.
4. Both bulk oxygen ions (limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species are involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane.
5. The reaction likely begins with C-H activation on the catalyst surface, followed by further reactions that may involve both surface and gas-phase steps.

This approach allows for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride while minimizing complete combustion to CO2. The catalyst's ability to provide oxygen for insertion into the hydrocarbon while maintaining selectivity is key to the reaction's success.

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about C-H bond activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers, Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, or the industrial application to butane oxidation. However, it does touch on some related concepts:

          1. The existence of a review article on C-H bond activation and organometallic intermediates on isolated metal centers on oxide surfaces is mentioned, which could be relevant to the question.
          
          2. Isolated surface hydrides and their formation, structure, and reactivity are mentioned, which could be related to C-H activation processes.
          
          3. The effect of hydrogen on Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts is discussed, noting that it enhances selectivity to paraffins at the expense of aromatics and olefins. This suggests that hydrogen can influence reaction pathways on these catalysts.
          
          4. Dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ga2O3 is mentioned, which could be a step in C-H activation processes on gallium-based catalysts.
          
          5. Catalysis for selective oxidation reactions is mentioned as a topic, which relates to the industrial application part of the question.

          Overall, while these points touch on aspects related to C-H activation and catalysis involving metal centers on oxide surfaces, they do not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific mechanisms of C-H activation, Mars van Krevelen processes, or the industrial application to butane oxidation as asked in the question. A more detailed review of the referenced articles and additional sources would be necessary to fully address the question.

The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum hydroxide clusters, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis:

1. Initial formation of weak van der Waals complexes between the alkane (e.g., propane) and the metal center.

2. Insertion of the aluminum atom into a C-H bond, rather than Brønsted acid-type hydron transfer.

3. Migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, forming a chemisorbed intermediate.

4. Subsequent elimination to form alkenes and H2.

This process is described as metal ion catalysis, applicable to both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites, with tetra-coordinated sites likely being more important catalytically. The mechanism has lower energy barriers for hydrogen exchange compared to elimination reactions.

The study does not specifically address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or industrial applications like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on metal oxide surfaces are relevant to understanding selective oxidation catalysis more broadly.

These findings suggest that traditional views of zeolites and alumina catalysts as solid superacids may need revision, as the activation appears to occur through metal ion insertion rather than proton transfer or hydride abstraction.

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis for selective oxidation of alkanes, or the specific Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms. It also does not discuss the industrial application of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it provides some relevant insights into C-H bond activation on alumina catalysts:

1. Exposed Al3+ surface ions act as active sites for various exchange reactions, including H2-D2 equilibration, D2 exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution. These sites have a concentration of about 8 x 10^12 per cm2.

2. The D2 exchange reactions likely involve a stepwise dissociative mechanism, with C-H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. This indicates that the Al3+ sites can activate C-H bonds.

3. The redistribution reaction may involve two molecules π-bonded to the same or adjacent Al3+ ions, suggesting a potential mechanism for C-H bond activation involving interaction between the π system of aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbons and the metal centers.

While the study focuses on alumina rather than other oxide materials or industrial processes, it provides insight into how metal centers on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms described here could potentially be applicable to other systems involving C-H activation on oxide catalysts.

The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum hydroxide clusters, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis:

1. Initial formation of weak van der Waals complexes between the alkane (e.g., propane) and the metal center.

2. Insertion of the aluminum atom into a C-H bond, rather than Brønsted acid-type hydron transfer.

3. Migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, forming a chemisorbed intermediate.

4. Subsequent elimination to form alkenes and H2.

This process is described as metal ion catalysis, applicable to both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites, with tetra-coordinated sites likely being more important catalytically. The mechanism has lower energy barriers for hydrogen exchange compared to elimination reactions.

The study does not specifically address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or industrial applications like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on metal oxide surfaces are relevant to understanding selective oxidation catalysis more broadly.

These findings suggest that traditional views of zeolites and alumina catalysts as solid superacids may need revision, as the activation appears to occur through metal ion insertion rather than proton transfer or hydride abstraction.

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis for selective oxidation of alkanes, or the specific Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms. It also does not discuss the industrial application of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it provides some relevant insights into C-H bond activation on alumina catalysts:

1. Exposed Al3+ surface ions act as active sites for various exchange reactions, including H2-D2 equilibration, D2 exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution. These sites have a concentration of about 8 x 10^12 per cm2.

2. The D2 exchange reactions likely involve a stepwise dissociative mechanism, with C-H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. This indicates that the Al3+ sites can activate C-H bonds.

3. The redistribution reaction may involve two molecules π-bonded to the same or adjacent Al3+ ions, suggesting a potential mechanism for C-H bond activation involving interaction between the π system of aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbons and the metal centers.

While the study focuses on alumina rather than other oxide materials or industrial processes, it provides insight into how metal centers on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms described here could potentially be applicable to other systems involving C-H activation on oxide catalysts.
