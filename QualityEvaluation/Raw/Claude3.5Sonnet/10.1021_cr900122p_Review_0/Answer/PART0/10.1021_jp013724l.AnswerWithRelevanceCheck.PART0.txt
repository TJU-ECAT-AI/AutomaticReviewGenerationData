          "DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were conducted on the reaction of the propane molecule with the aluminum hydroxide clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0,1). Weak, physisorbed (van der Waals) complexes were identified. Chemisorption does not involve the Brnsted acidity of the catalyst, as no hydron transfer occurs. Instead, the reaction involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a CH bond, followed by the migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, to form the chemisorbed intermediate"

"Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis."

"The insertion of the metal ion into the CH bonds, predicted by the calculations, liberates the mechanistic model from such improbable acidbase reactions."

"Dehydrogenation on tricoordinated and especially tetracoordinated aluminum centers by the mechanism uncovered here represents an alternative alkane activation mechanism."

"The calculations show that the hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a much lower potential energy barrier than the elimination, for all clusters and for all types of CH bonds."

"The elimination of hydrogen from Cβ and oxygen gives then H2 and propene, which forms a strong π complex with the aluminum cluster for x = 0."

          The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum hydroxide clusters, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis:

1. Initial formation of weak van der Waals complexes between the alkane (e.g., propane) and the metal center.

2. Insertion of the aluminum atom into a C-H bond, rather than Brønsted acid-type hydron transfer.

3. Migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, forming a chemisorbed intermediate.

4. Subsequent elimination to form alkenes and H2.

This process is described as metal ion catalysis, applicable to both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites, with tetra-coordinated sites likely being more important catalytically. The mechanism has lower energy barriers for hydrogen exchange compared to elimination reactions.

The study does not specifically address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or industrial applications like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on metal oxide surfaces are relevant to understanding selective oxidation catalysis more broadly.

These findings suggest that traditional views of zeolites and alumina catalysts as solid superacids may need revision, as the activation appears to occur through metal ion insertion rather than proton transfer or hydride abstraction.

          该文献描述了孤立金属中心，特别是氢氧化铝簇，如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 烷烃（如丙烷）与金属中心之间初始形成弱范德华复合物。

2. 铝原子插入C-H键，而不是布朗斯特酸型的氢转移。

3. 氢原子从铝迁移到氧，形成化学吸附的中间体。

4. 随后的消除反应形成烯烃和H2。

这个过程被描述为金属离子催化，适用于三配位和四配位铝位点，其中四配位位点可能在催化方面更重要。与消除反应相比，该机制对氢交换的能量势垒较低。

该研究没有具体讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或工业应用，如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐。然而，对金属氧化物表面C-H活化机制的见解与理解选择性氧化催化更广泛相关。

这些发现表明，传统上将沸石和氧化铝催化剂视为固体超强酸的观点可能需要修正，因为活化似乎是通过金属离子插入而不是质子转移或氢化物提取发生的。
