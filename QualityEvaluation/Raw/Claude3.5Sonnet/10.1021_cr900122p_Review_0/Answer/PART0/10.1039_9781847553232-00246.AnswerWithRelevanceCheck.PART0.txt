          [1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[3] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[4] "A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported in Table 2."

[5] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

[6] "A peculiarity of the catalyst is that no support has been used. The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters, (2) embedding the precursor with Zr and Ti pyrophosphate in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."

[7] "How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"

[8] "What is the mechanism of activation of the paraffin, abstraction of w, of H-, of H, or H+' donation?"

[9] "Is the selectivity also related to the mechanism of activation?"

[10] "None of these intermediates is observed among the reaction products under usual reaction conditions. This raises a doubt about the validity of the proposed mechanism; however, the absence of intermediate products can be justified simply by kinetic reasons."

          The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a key industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst in fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors.

The mechanism likely involves both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, though the exact details are not fully elucidated in the given text. The reaction is believed to proceed through several intermediates, but these are not typically observed due to kinetic factors. The initial C-H bond activation of butane is the rate-determining step.

Key factors influencing catalyst performance include the preparation method, phosphorus to vanadium (P/V) ratio, presence of additives, and activation/conditioning procedures. These parameters affect the catalyst structure and surface properties, which in turn impact its ability to selectively activate C-H bonds.

The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst demonstrates remarkable selectivity in converting butane directly to maleic anhydride without producing significant amounts of intermediate products. This highlights the catalyst's ability to efficiently perform multiple oxidation steps once the initial C-H activation occurs.

A unique feature of this catalyst is that it's unsupported, with mechanical strength developed through special treatments, addition of promoters, or encapsulation techniques.

While the exact mechanism of paraffin activation (whether it involves abstraction of H-, H, or H+ donation) and its relation to selectivity remain open questions, the industrial success of this process demonstrates how isolated metal centers on oxide supports can be leveraged for selective alkane oxidation through careful catalyst design and reaction engineering.

          正丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行烷烃选择性氧化的重要工业实例。这个过程使用钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂，应用于固定床、移动床和流化床反应器中。

反应机理可能涉及Mars van Krevelen和氢抽提过程，尽管给定文本中没有详细说明具体细节。反应被认为通过几个中间体进行，但由于动力学因素，这些中间体通常不被观察到。正丁烷的初始C-H键活化是速率决定步骤。

影响催化剂性能的关键因素包括制备方法、磷与钒(P/V)比例、添加剂的存在以及活化/调节程序。这些参数影响催化剂的结构和表面性质，进而影响其选择性活化C-H键的能力。

钒焦磷酸盐催化剂在将正丁烷直接转化为马来酸酐时表现出显著的选择性，而不产生大量中间产物。这突出了催化剂在初始C-H活化发生后能够有效进行多个氧化步骤的能力。

这种催化剂的一个独特特征是它是无载体的，通过特殊处理、添加促进剂或封装技术来发展机械强度。

虽然烷烃活化的确切机制（是否涉及H-、H或H+的抽取）及其与选择性的关系仍然是开放性问题，但这一工艺在工业上的成功表明，通过仔细的催化剂设计和反应工程，可以利用氧化物支撑物上的孤立金属中心进行选择性烷烃氧化。
