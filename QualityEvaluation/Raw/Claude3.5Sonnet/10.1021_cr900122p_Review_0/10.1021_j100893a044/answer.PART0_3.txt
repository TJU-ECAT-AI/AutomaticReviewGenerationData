[1] "It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."

[2] "Evidently, on silica-alumina, the sites are not the same as on alumina; they appear to be weaker. Consequently, much higher temperatures are required to activate the methane molecule."

[3] "With alumina, the methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion with concomitant formation of a hydroxyl group"

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers on oxide materials or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does discuss some aspects of C-H bond activation on alumina and silica-alumina catalysts:

1. On alumina, C-H bond activation appears to occur at specific active sites, likely involving exposed aluminum ions. The methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion while a hydroxyl group forms.

2. Silica-alumina catalysts have weaker sites than alumina and require higher temperatures to activate methane molecules. 

3. Hydrogen diffusion from distant locations to active sites plays a role in the catalytic process on alumina.

4. The literature does not discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms specifically.

5. No information is provided about industrial applications or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

While the document offers some insights into C-H bond activation on oxide catalysts, it does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about isolated metal centers, specific mechanisms, or industrial applications.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心或烷烃工业选择性氧化(如丁烷到马来酸酐的转化)。但是,它确实讨论了在氧化铝和硅铝催化剂上C-H键活化的一些方面:

1. 在氧化铝上,C-H键活化似乎发生在特定的活性位点,可能涉及暴露的铝离子。甲基被认为是由铝离子持有,同时形成羟基。

2. 硅铝催化剂的活性位点比氧化铝弱,需要更高的温度来活化甲烷分子。

3. 氢从远处扩散到活性位点在氧化铝上的催化过程中起作用。

4. 文献并未具体讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。

5. 没有提供关于工业应用或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的信息。

虽然该文献对氧化物催化剂上的C-H键活化提供了一些见解,但它没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于孤立金属中心、具体机理或工业应用的问题。
