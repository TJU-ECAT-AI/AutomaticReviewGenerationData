How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to the question about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The text primarily discusses methane exchange reactions over alumina and silica-alumina catalysts, focusing on isotope effects and surface chemistry. It does not address the specific topics mentioned in the question.

[1] "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by alumina and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood. By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."

[2] "Since methane is readily deuterated over alumina, it may be supposed that the molecule is cleaved as it is chemisorbed. If it reacted with the dual acid-base surface sites in a manner analogous to NH3 and H2O, then Al-CH3 and adjacent OH groups would be formed."

[3] "These equations indicate ways in which hydrocarbons may dissociate and adsorb, but they offer no insight into the mechanism of hydrogen exchange with catalyst deuteroxyl groups."

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers on oxide materials or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. However, it does provide some insight into C-H bond activation mechanisms on alumina and silica-alumina surfaces:

For alumina, the literature suggests that methane is cleaved upon chemisorption, likely forming Al-CH3 and adjacent OH groups at dual acid-base surface sites. This implies a heterolytic C-H bond activation mechanism.

For silica-alumina, the mechanism is less clear. The literature mentions possible formation of carbonium ions from paraffins via hydride abstraction at defect sites, but notes this may not apply to methane.

The document does not discuss Mars van Krevelen mechanisms or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Overall, it emphasizes that the activation of hydrogen and hydrocarbons on these surfaces is not well understood, and more research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心或烷烃的工业选择性氧化。然而，它确实为氧化铝和硅铝表面上的C-H键活化机理提供了一些见解：

对于氧化铝，文献表明甲烷在化学吸附时会被裂解，可能在双酸碱表面位点形成Al-CH3和相邻的OH基团。这意味着存在异裂C-H键活化机制。

对于硅铝，机制不太清楚。文献提到在缺陷位点可能通过氢化物抽提从链烷形成碳正离子，但指出这可能不适用于甲烷。

该文档没有讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。总的来说，它强调在这些表面上氢和碳氢化合物的活化机制尚不清楚，需要更多研究来阐明所涉及的确切机制。

[1] "It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."

[2] "Evidently, on silica-alumina, the sites are not the same as on alumina; they appear to be weaker. Consequently, much higher temperatures are required to activate the methane molecule."

[3] "With alumina, the methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion with concomitant formation of a hydroxyl group"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers on oxide materials or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does discuss some aspects of C-H bond activation on alumina and silica-alumina catalysts:

1. On alumina, C-H bond activation appears to occur at specific active sites, likely involving exposed aluminum ions. The methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion while a hydroxyl group forms.

2. Silica-alumina catalysts have weaker sites than alumina and require higher temperatures to activate methane molecules. 

3. Hydrogen diffusion from distant locations to active sites plays a role in the catalytic process on alumina.

4. The literature does not discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms specifically.

5. No information is provided about industrial applications or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

While the document offers some insights into C-H bond activation on oxide catalysts, it does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about isolated metal centers, specific mechanisms, or industrial applications.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心或烷烃工业选择性氧化(如丁烷到马来酸酐的转化)。但是,它确实讨论了在氧化铝和硅铝催化剂上C-H键活化的一些方面:

1. 在氧化铝上,C-H键活化似乎发生在特定的活性位点,可能涉及暴露的铝离子。甲基被认为是由铝离子持有,同时形成羟基。

2. 硅铝催化剂的活性位点比氧化铝弱,需要更高的温度来活化甲烷分子。

3. 氢从远处扩散到活性位点在氧化铝上的催化过程中起作用。

4. 文献并未具体讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。

5. 没有提供关于工业应用或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的信息。

虽然该文献对氧化物催化剂上的C-H键活化提供了一些见解,但它没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于孤立金属中心、具体机理或工业应用的问题。

[1] "The catalyst was thermostated to ±0.5° by an automatically controlled electric furnace above 100° and by liquid baths below this temperature."

[2] "As the surface hydroxyl groups are mobile at this temperature, all of the catalyst hydrogen was available for exchange."

[3] "It was found that the reaction was catalyzed by a small number (~5 X 1012/cm.2) of active sites and involved exchange with only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups."

[4] "Over alumina, mixing took place at a readily measurable rate at room temperature with an activation energy of 5.7 kcal./mole."

[5] "A model was derived to describe our results. Assuming that only one hydrogen (deuterium) atom is exchanged per interaction with the catalyst, and that the available OD is large compared with methane, the following reactions may be written"

The provided literature does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or the industrial application to selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride.

However, the literature does discuss some relevant aspects of heterogeneous catalysis involving C-H bond activation:

1. The study focuses on the exchange of hydroxyl groups on alumina and silica-alumina catalysts with deuterated methane.

2. The catalytic reaction involves a small number of active sites (~5 x 10^12/cm^2) on the catalyst surface.

3. Only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups participate in the exchange reaction.

4. The activation energy for the mixing reaction on alumina was found to be 5.7 kcal/mole.

5. The proposed mechanism involves the exchange of one hydrogen (deuterium) atom per interaction with the catalyst.

While these findings provide insights into C-H bond activation on oxide catalysts, they do not specifically address the mechanisms or industrial applications mentioned in the question. The study focuses more on fundamental aspects of methane exchange reactions rather than selective oxidation processes or specific industrial applications.

所提供的文献并未直接涉及氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen和H-抽取等机制，或者这些原理在工业烷烃选择性氧化中的应用，如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。

然而，该文献确实讨论了涉及C-H键活化的多相催化的一些相关方面：

1. 这项研究主要关注氧化铝和硅铝催化剂上羟基与氘代甲烷的交换反应。

2. 催化反应涉及催化剂表面上少量的活性位点（约5 x 10^12/cm^2）。

3. 只有约1%的催化剂羟基参与交换反应。

4. 在氧化铝上进行的混合反应的活化能被发现为5.7千卡/摩尔。

5. 提出的机制涉及每次与催化剂相互作用时交换一个氢（氘）原子。

虽然这些发现为氧化物催化剂上的C-H键活化提供了一些见解，但它们并未特别涉及问题中提到的机制或工业应用。这项研究更多地关注甲烷交换反应的基本方面，而非选择性氧化过程或特定的工业应用。
