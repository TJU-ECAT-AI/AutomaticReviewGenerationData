          "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by alumina and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood. By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."

"Since methane is readily deuterated over alumina, it may be supposed that the molecule is cleaved as it is chemisorbed. If it reacted with the dual acid-base surface sites in a manner analogous to NH3 and H2O, then Al-CH3 and adjacent OH groups would be formed."

"These equations indicate ways in which hydrocarbons may dissociate and adsorb, but they offer no insight into the mechanism of hydrogen exchange with catalyst deuteroxyl groups."

"It seems reasonable to ascribe this slower process to the diffusion of hydrogen from distant locations, to positions adjacent to the active sites."

"Evidently, on silica-alumina, the sites are not the same as on alumina; they appear to be weaker. Consequently, much higher temperatures are required to activate the methane molecule."

"With alumina, the methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion with concomitant formation of a hydroxyl group"

"The catalyst was thermostated to ±0.5° by an automatically controlled electric furnace above 100° and by liquid baths below this temperature."

"As the surface hydroxyl groups are mobile at this temperature, all of the catalyst hydrogen was available for exchange."

"It was found that the reaction was catalyzed by a small number (~5 X 1012/cm.2) of active sites and involved exchange with only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups."

"Over alumina, mixing took place at a readily measurable rate at room temperature with an activation energy of 5.7 kcal./mole."

"A model was derived to describe our results. Assuming that only one hydrogen (deuterium) atom is exchanged per interaction with the catalyst, and that the available OD is large compared with methane, the following reactions may be written"

          The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or the industrial application to selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some insights into C-H bond activation on alumina and silica-alumina catalysts:

1. On alumina, C-H bond activation appears to occur at specific active sites, likely involving exposed aluminum ions. The methyl group is thought to be held by the aluminum ion while a hydroxyl group forms.

2. Silica-alumina catalysts have weaker sites than alumina and require higher temperatures to activate methane molecules.

3. The catalytic reaction involves a small number of active sites (~5 x 10^12/cm^2) on the catalyst surface, with only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups participating in the exchange reaction.

4. For alumina, the activation energy for the mixing reaction was found to be 5.7 kcal/mole.

5. The proposed mechanism involves the exchange of one hydrogen (deuterium) atom per interaction with the catalyst.

6. Hydrogen diffusion from distant locations to active sites plays a role in the catalytic process on alumina.

The study focuses more on fundamental aspects of methane exchange reactions rather than selective oxidation processes or specific industrial applications. While these findings provide insights into C-H bond activation on oxide catalysts, they do not specifically address the mechanisms or industrial applications mentioned in the question.

          该文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen和H-抽取等机制，或者这些原理在工业烷烃选择性氧化中的应用，如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。然而，它确实为氧化铝和硅铝催化剂上的C-H键活化提供了一些见解：

1. 在氧化铝上，C-H键活化似乎发生在特定的活性位点，可能涉及暴露的铝离子。甲基被认为是由铝离子持有，同时形成羟基。

2. 硅铝催化剂的活性位点比氧化铝弱，需要更高的温度来活化甲烷分子。

3. 催化反应涉及催化剂表面上少量的活性位点（约5 x 10^12/cm^2），只有约1%的催化剂羟基参与交换反应。

4. 对于氧化铝，混合反应的活化能被发现为5.7千卡/摩尔。

5. 提出的机制涉及每次与催化剂相互作用时交换一个氢（氘）原子。

6. 氢从远处扩散到活性位点在氧化铝上的催化过程中起作用。

这项研究更多地关注甲烷交换反应的基本方面，而非选择性氧化过程或特定的工业应用。虽然这些发现为氧化物催化剂上的C-H键活化提供了一些见解，但它们并未特别涉及问题中提到的机制或工业应用。
