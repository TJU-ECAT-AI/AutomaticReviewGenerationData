[1] "The manner in which hydrogen is activated by alumina and silica-alumina surfaces is not at all understood. By analogy with the present methane results, hydrogen may be cleaved on the alumina surface to form an Al-H and an adjacent OH."

[2] "Since methane is readily deuterated over alumina, it may be supposed that the molecule is cleaved as it is chemisorbed. If it reacted with the dual acid-base surface sites in a manner analogous to NH3 and H2O, then Al-CH3 and adjacent OH groups would be formed."

[3] "These equations indicate ways in which hydrocarbons may dissociate and adsorb, but they offer no insight into the mechanism of hydrogen exchange with catalyst deuteroxyl groups."

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers on oxide materials or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. However, it does provide some insight into C-H bond activation mechanisms on alumina and silica-alumina surfaces:

For alumina, the literature suggests that methane is cleaved upon chemisorption, likely forming Al-CH3 and adjacent OH groups at dual acid-base surface sites. This implies a heterolytic C-H bond activation mechanism.

For silica-alumina, the mechanism is less clear. The literature mentions possible formation of carbonium ions from paraffins via hydride abstraction at defect sites, but notes this may not apply to methane.

The document does not discuss Mars van Krevelen mechanisms or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. Overall, it emphasizes that the activation of hydrogen and hydrocarbons on these surfaces is not well understood, and more research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心或烷烃的工业选择性氧化。然而，它确实为氧化铝和硅铝表面上的C-H键活化机理提供了一些见解：

对于氧化铝，文献表明甲烷在化学吸附时会被裂解，可能在双酸碱表面位点形成Al-CH3和相邻的OH基团。这意味着存在异裂C-H键活化机制。

对于硅铝，机制不太清楚。文献提到在缺陷位点可能通过氢化物抽提从链烷形成碳正离子，但指出这可能不适用于甲烷。

该文档没有讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。总的来说，它强调在这些表面上氢和碳氢化合物的活化机制尚不清楚，需要更多研究来阐明所涉及的确切机制。
