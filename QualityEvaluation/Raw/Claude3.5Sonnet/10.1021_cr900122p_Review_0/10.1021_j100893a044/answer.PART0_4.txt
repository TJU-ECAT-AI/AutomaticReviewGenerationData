[1] "The catalyst was thermostated to ±0.5° by an automatically controlled electric furnace above 100° and by liquid baths below this temperature."

[2] "As the surface hydroxyl groups are mobile at this temperature, all of the catalyst hydrogen was available for exchange."

[3] "It was found that the reaction was catalyzed by a small number (~5 X 1012/cm.2) of active sites and involved exchange with only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups."

[4] "Over alumina, mixing took place at a readily measurable rate at room temperature with an activation energy of 5.7 kcal./mole."

[5] "A model was derived to describe our results. Assuming that only one hydrogen (deuterium) atom is exchanged per interaction with the catalyst, and that the available OD is large compared with methane, the following reactions may be written"

The provided literature does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or the industrial application to selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride.

However, the literature does discuss some relevant aspects of heterogeneous catalysis involving C-H bond activation:

1. The study focuses on the exchange of hydroxyl groups on alumina and silica-alumina catalysts with deuterated methane.

2. The catalytic reaction involves a small number of active sites (~5 x 10^12/cm^2) on the catalyst surface.

3. Only about 1% of the catalyst hydroxyl groups participate in the exchange reaction.

4. The activation energy for the mixing reaction on alumina was found to be 5.7 kcal/mole.

5. The proposed mechanism involves the exchange of one hydrogen (deuterium) atom per interaction with the catalyst.

While these findings provide insights into C-H bond activation on oxide catalysts, they do not specifically address the mechanisms or industrial applications mentioned in the question. The study focuses more on fundamental aspects of methane exchange reactions rather than selective oxidation processes or specific industrial applications.

所提供的文献并未直接涉及氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen和H-抽取等机制，或者这些原理在工业烷烃选择性氧化中的应用，如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。

然而，该文献确实讨论了涉及C-H键活化的多相催化的一些相关方面：

1. 这项研究主要关注氧化铝和硅铝催化剂上羟基与氘代甲烷的交换反应。

2. 催化反应涉及催化剂表面上少量的活性位点（约5 x 10^12/cm^2）。

3. 只有约1%的催化剂羟基参与交换反应。

4. 在氧化铝上进行的混合反应的活化能被发现为5.7千卡/摩尔。

5. 提出的机制涉及每次与催化剂相互作用时交换一个氢（氘）原子。

虽然这些发现为氧化物催化剂上的C-H键活化提供了一些见解，但它们并未特别涉及问题中提到的机制或工业应用。这项研究更多地关注甲烷交换反应的基本方面，而非选择性氧化过程或特定的工业应用。
