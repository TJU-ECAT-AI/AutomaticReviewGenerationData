Isolated metal centers on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are likely involved in these processes, though the specific mechanisms are not detailed in the given literature. The principles of C-H activation by isolated metal centers are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, but the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is not specifically mentioned as an example in the provided text. More detailed information about the mechanisms and industrial applications would require additional sources beyond what is provided in this literature excerpt.

氧化物表面上的孤立金属中心可以促进多相催化中的C-H键活化。Mars-van Krevelen机理和H-抽提可能参与这些过程,尽管给定文献中没有详细说明具体机制。孤立金属中心C-H活化的原理应用于烷烃的工业选择性氧化,但文中没有特别提到丁烷转化为马来酸酐的例子。关于机制和工业应用的更详细信息需要超出本文献摘录所提供的额外资料。
