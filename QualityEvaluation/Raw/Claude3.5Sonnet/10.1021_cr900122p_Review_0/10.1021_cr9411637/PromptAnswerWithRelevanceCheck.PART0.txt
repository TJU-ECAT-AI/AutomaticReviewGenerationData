<questions>

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "Isolated surface hydrides: Formation, Structure, and Reactivity"

[2] "The existence of gaseous hydrogen has no effect on the conversion of n-butane and on product selectivities over H-ZSM-5, whereas in the case of Ga-ZSM-5, the selectivity to paraffins was enhanced at the expense of aromatics and C2C4 olefins."

[3] "Dissociative adsorption of H2 over Ga2O3 is confirmed by IR results."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis or the specific mechanisms involved. It also does not discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction in detail. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is not mentioned.

However, the literature does touch on some related concepts:

1. It mentions isolated surface hydrides and their formation, structure, and reactivity, which could be relevant to C-H activation processes.

2. The document discusses the effect of hydrogen on Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts, noting that it enhances selectivity to paraffins at the expense of aromatics and olefins. This suggests that hydrogen can influence reaction pathways on these catalysts.

3. Dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ga2O3 is mentioned, which could be a step in C-H activation processes on gallium-based catalysts.

Overall, while the document touches on some aspects related to C-H activation and catalysis involving gallium-based materials, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about mechanisms of C-H activation on isolated metal centers or the industrial application to butane oxidation.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

文献没有提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化或所涉及的具体机制的详细信息。它也没有详细讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H-抽提。文中没有提到丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。

然而，文献确实涉及了一些相关概念：

1. 它提到了孤立表面氢化物及其形成、结构和反应性，这可能与C-H活化过程有关。

2. 文档讨论了氢对Ga-ZSM-5催化剂的影响，指出氢增强了对石蜡的选择性，但降低了芳烃和烯烃的选择性。这表明氢可以影响这些催化剂上的反应途径。

3. 提到了H2在Ga2O3上的解离吸附，这可能是镓基催化剂上C-H活化过程的一个步骤。

总的来说，虽然该文档涉及了一些与C-H活化和镓基材料催化相关的方面，但它并没有对孤立金属中心上C-H活化机制或丁烷氧化的工业应用这一问题提供全面的回答。

The literature does not provide specific details to fully answer the question about C-H bond activation mechanisms, Mars van Krevelen processes, or industrial applications like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The document only contains a reference to a review article on C-H bond activation on isolated metal centers on oxide surfaces, but does not discuss the content of that article. To properly address this question would require examining that referenced review article or other sources not provided in the given literature.

Isolated metal centers on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are likely involved in these processes, though the specific mechanisms are not detailed in the given literature. The principles of C-H activation by isolated metal centers are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, but the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is not specifically mentioned as an example in the provided text. More detailed information about the mechanisms and industrial applications would require additional sources beyond what is provided in this literature excerpt.
