          "These findings lead us to suggest that the Hz-D equilibration, Dz exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution reactions all occur on the same exposed A13+ surface ions whose concentration is the order of 8 X 101%/cm2."

"The D2 exchange reactions are likely stepwise involving a dissociative mechanism whose slow step is CH cleavage."

"Perhaps two molecules ?r bonded to the same or adjacent A13+ ions could undergo the redistribution reaction."

"The sites may be the same ones on which NO is weakly adsorbed13 and with which COZ interacts to give an ir band at 1780 cm-l.18"

          The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis for selective oxidation of alkanes, or the specific Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms. It also does not discuss the industrial application of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it provides some relevant insights into C-H bond activation on alumina catalysts:

1. Exposed Al3+ surface ions act as active sites for various exchange reactions, including H2-D2 equilibration, D2 exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution. These sites have a concentration of about 8 x 10^12 per cm2.

2. The D2 exchange reactions likely involve a stepwise dissociative mechanism, with C-H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. This indicates that the Al3+ sites can activate C-H bonds.

3. The redistribution reaction may involve two molecules π-bonded to the same or adjacent Al3+ ions, suggesting a potential mechanism for C-H bond activation involving interaction between the π system of aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbons and the metal centers.

While the study focuses on alumina rather than other oxide materials or industrial processes, it provides insight into how metal centers on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms described here could potentially be applicable to other systems involving C-H activation on oxide catalysts.

          这篇文献并未直接讨论孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化以选择性氧化烷烃，也没有具体讨论Mars van Krevelen和H-抽取机制。它也没有涉及丁烷转化为马来酸酐的工业应用。然而，它提供了一些关于氧化铝催化剂上C-H键活化的相关见解：

1. 暴露的Al3+表面离子作为活性位点，可以催化各种交换反应，包括H2-D2平衡、D2交换和分子间HD重分布。这些位点的浓度约为8 x 10^12 每平方厘米。

2. D2交换反应可能涉及逐步解离机制，其中C-H键断裂是速率限制步骤。这表明Al3+位点可以活化C-H键。

3. 重分布反应可能涉及两个分子π键合到相同或相邻的Al3+离子上。这表明了C-H键活化的潜在机制，涉及芳香族或不饱和烃的π系统与金属中心之间的相互作用。

虽然该研究主要关注氧化铝而非其他氧化物材料或工业过程，但它提供了关于氧化物表面金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化的见解。这里描述的机制可能适用于其他涉及氧化物催化剂上C-H活化的系统。
