How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

[1] "Perhaps two molecules π bonded to the same or adjacent Al3+ ions could undergo the redistribution reaction."

[2] "These findings lead us to suggest that the H2-D equilibration, D2 exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution reactions all occur on the same exposed Al3+ surface ions whose concentration is the order of 8 × 1012/cm2."

[3] "The D2 exchange reactions are likely stepwise involving a dissociative mechanism whose slow step is CH cleavage."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms, or the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some insights into C-H bond activation on alumina catalysts:

The study suggests that exposed Al3+ surface ions act as active sites for various exchange reactions, including D2 exchange with benzene. These sites have a concentration of about 8 × 1012/cm2. The exchange reactions likely involve a stepwise, dissociative mechanism where C-H bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step. 

The π-bonding of molecules to Al3+ ions is proposed as a possible mechanism for redistribution reactions. This interaction with the π system may explain the higher reactivity of vinyl and aromatic C-H bonds compared to paraffinic C-H bonds.

While this information provides some insight into C-H activation on oxide surfaces, it does not directly address the specific industrial application or mechanisms mentioned in the question.

这篇文献并未直接讨论独立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提机理，或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐的工业应用。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化铝催化剂上C-H键活化的见解：

研究表明，暴露的Al3+表面离子作为活性位点参与各种交换反应，包括苯与D2的交换。这些位点的浓度约为8 × 1012/cm2。交换反应可能涉及逐步的解离机理，其中C-H键断裂是速率限制步骤。

研究提出分子与Al3+离子的π键合可能是重排反应的机理。这种与π体系的相互作用可能解释了乙烯基和芳香族C-H键比烷基C-H键具有更高的反应活性。

虽然这些信息为氧化物表面上的C-H活化提供了一些见解，但它并未直接涉及问题中提到的特定工业应用或机理。

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing isolated metal centers on oxide materials, C-H bond activation mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The text focuses on deuterium exchange reactions with benzene over alumina catalysts, which is a different topic than what is asked in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered using the information provided in the document.

The literature does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. However, it does provide some relevant information about C-H bond activation on alumina catalysts:

The study suggests that exposed Al3+ surface ions act as active sites for H2-D2 equilibration, D2 exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution reactions. These sites have a concentration of about 8 x 10^12 per cm2. 

The D2 exchange reactions likely involve a stepwise dissociative mechanism, with CH cleavage as the rate-limiting step. This indicates that the Al3+ sites can activate C-H bonds.

The redistribution reaction may involve two molecules π-bonded to the same or adjacent Al3+ ions. This suggests a potential mechanism for C-H bond activation involving interaction between the π system of aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbons and the metal centers.

While the study focuses on alumina rather than other oxide materials or industrial processes like butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, it provides insight into how metal centers on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanisms described here could potentially be applicable to other systems involving C-H activation on oxide catalysts.

该文献并未直接回答关于孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen机制或烷烃工业选择性氧化的具体问题。但它确实提供了一些关于氧化铝催化剂上C-H键活化的相关信息：

研究表明，暴露的Al3+表面离子作为活性位点，可以催化H2-D2平衡、D2交换和分子间HD重分布反应。这些位点的浓度约为8 x 10^12 每平方厘米。

D2交换反应可能涉及逐步解离机制，其中CH键断裂是速率限制步骤。这表明Al3+位点可以活化C-H键。

重分布反应可能涉及两个分子π键合到相同或相邻的Al3+离子上。这表明了C-H键活化的潜在机制，涉及芳香族或不饱和烃的π系统与金属中心之间的相互作用。

虽然该研究主要关注氧化铝而非其他氧化物材料或工业过程（如丁烷氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐），但它提供了关于氧化物表面金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化的见解。这里描述的机制可能适用于其他涉及氧化物催化剂上C-H活化的系统。
