[1] "These findings lead us to suggest that the Hz-D equilibration, Dz exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution reactions all occur on the same exposed A13+ surface ions whose concentration is the order of 8 X 101%/cm2."

[2] "The D2 exchange reactions are likely stepwise involving a dissociative mechanism whose slow step is CH cleavage."

[3] "Perhaps two molecules ?r bonded to the same or adjacent A13+ ions could undergo the redistribution reaction."

The literature does not directly address isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis for selective oxidation of alkanes. It focuses on deuterium exchange reactions over alumina catalysts. The text does mention exposed Al3+ surface ions as active sites for H-D exchange and redistribution reactions, involving a dissociative mechanism with C-H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. However, it does not discuss Mars van Krevelen mechanisms, H-abstraction, or industrial applications like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The principles described are limited to deuterium exchange reactions rather than selective oxidation processes.

这篇文献并未直接讨论孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化以选择性氧化烷烃。它主要关注氧化铝催化剂上的氘交换反应。文中确实提到了暴露的Al3+表面离子作为H-D交换和重分布反应的活性位点,涉及一个解离机制,其中C-H键断裂是速率限制步骤。然而,它并未讨论Mars van Krevelen机制、H-抽取或工业应用,如丁烷转化为马来酸酐。所描述的原理仅限于氘交换反应,而非选择性氧化过程。
