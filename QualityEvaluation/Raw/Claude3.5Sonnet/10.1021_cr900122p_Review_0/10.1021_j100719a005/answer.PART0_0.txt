[1] "Perhaps two molecules π bonded to the same or adjacent Al3+ ions could undergo the redistribution reaction."

[2] "These findings lead us to suggest that the H2-D equilibration, D2 exchange, and intermolecular HD redistribution reactions all occur on the same exposed Al3+ surface ions whose concentration is the order of 8 × 1012/cm2."

[3] "The D2 exchange reactions are likely stepwise involving a dissociative mechanism whose slow step is CH cleavage."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction mechanisms, or the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some insights into C-H bond activation on alumina catalysts:

The study suggests that exposed Al3+ surface ions act as active sites for various exchange reactions, including D2 exchange with benzene. These sites have a concentration of about 8 × 1012/cm2. The exchange reactions likely involve a stepwise, dissociative mechanism where C-H bond cleavage is the rate-limiting step. 

The π-bonding of molecules to Al3+ ions is proposed as a possible mechanism for redistribution reactions. This interaction with the π system may explain the higher reactivity of vinyl and aromatic C-H bonds compared to paraffinic C-H bonds.

While this information provides some insight into C-H activation on oxide surfaces, it does not directly address the specific industrial application or mechanisms mentioned in the question.

这篇文献并未直接讨论独立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提机理，或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐的工业应用。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化铝催化剂上C-H键活化的见解：

研究表明，暴露的Al3+表面离子作为活性位点参与各种交换反应，包括苯与D2的交换。这些位点的浓度约为8 × 1012/cm2。交换反应可能涉及逐步的解离机理，其中C-H键断裂是速率限制步骤。

研究提出分子与Al3+离子的π键合可能是重排反应的机理。这种与π体系的相互作用可能解释了乙烯基和芳香族C-H键比烷基C-H键具有更高的反应活性。

虽然这些信息为氧化物表面上的C-H活化提供了一些见解，但它并未直接涉及问题中提到的特定工业应用或机理。
