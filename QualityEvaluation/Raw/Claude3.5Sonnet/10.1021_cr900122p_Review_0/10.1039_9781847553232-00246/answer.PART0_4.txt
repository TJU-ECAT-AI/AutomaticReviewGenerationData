[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[3] "The main difference observed in several precursors is the morphology of the (VO) HP04.0.5H20 crystallites."

[4] "A peculiarity of the catalyst is that no support has been used. The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters,8 (2) embedding the precursor with Zr and Ti pyrophosphate' in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."

[5] "How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"

[6] "What is the mechanism of activation of the paraffin, abstraction of w, of H-, of H, or H+' donation?"

[7] "Is the selectivity also related to the mechanism of activation?"

[8] "A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported in Table 2."

[9] "None of these intermediates is observed among the reaction products under usual reaction conditions. This raises a doubt about the validity of the proposed mechanism; however, the absence of intermediate products can be justified simply by kinetic reasons."

[10] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

The literature does not provide detailed information on how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does discuss the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example.

For the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride:

1. The catalyst used is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7, which is unsupported and has special treatments to develop mechanical strength.

2. The mechanism involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and oxygen insertion reactions. However, intermediates are not observed under usual reaction conditions due to kinetic reasons.

3. The rate-determining step is the initial activation of butane. Subsequent steps occur much faster, leading to quick transformation of intermediates to maleic anhydride.

4. The literature raises questions about the mechanism of paraffin activation, including whether it involves abstraction of H-, H, or H+ donation, but does not provide definitive answers.

5. The selectivity of the reaction is likely related to the mechanism of activation, but this relationship is not explicitly explained in the given text.

6. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not specifically mentioned in the provided literature for this reaction.

While the document provides some insights into the industrial process and reaction mechanism, it does not directly address how isolated metal centers facilitate C-H bond activation or the specific mechanisms involved in these processes.

该文献没有提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化的详细信息。但是,它确实讨论了丁烷选择性氧化制顺丁烯二酸酐作为一个具体的工业应用例子。

对于丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐:

1. 使用的催化剂是无载体的焦磷酸钒(VO)2P2O7,通过特殊处理和添加少量促进剂来增强机械强度。

2. 反应机理包括几个步骤,包括氧化脱氢、烯丙位氧化和氧插入反应。然而,在通常的反应条件下由于动力学原因不会观察到中间体。

3. 决速步骤是丁烷的初始活化。后续步骤发生得更快,导致中间体快速转化为顺丁烯二酐。

4. 文献提出了关于烷烃活化机理的问题,包括是否涉及H-、H或H+的抽取,但没有给出明确的答案。

5. 反应的选择性可能与活化机理有关,但文中并未明确解释这种关系。

6. 所提供的文献中没有具体提到这个反应的Mars-van Krevelen机理。

虽然该文档提供了一些关于工业过程和反应机理的见解,但它并没有直接解释孤立金属中心如何促进C-H键活化或这些过程中涉及的具体机制。
