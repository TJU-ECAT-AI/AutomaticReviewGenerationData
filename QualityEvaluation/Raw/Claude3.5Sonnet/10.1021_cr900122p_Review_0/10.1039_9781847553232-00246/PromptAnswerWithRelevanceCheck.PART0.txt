[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. Knowledge of the type of active sites and the features of the activation mechanism that allow high selectivity to be obtained can be useful in improving selectivity and activity in the oxidation of other paraffins."

[3] "Fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P2O7, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "A peculiarity of the catalyst is that no support has been used. The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters, (2) embedding the precursor with Zr and Ti pyrophosphate in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."

[5] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 20-25 to 60 times higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst, which has been extensively studied.

The activation of the C-H bond in butane is believed to be the rate-determining step in this reaction. While the exact mechanism is not fully detailed in the given text, it likely involves Mars-van Krevelen or hydrogen abstraction processes typical of metal oxide catalysts. 

The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst is unique in its ability to selectively activate the paraffin (butane) while also facilitating the subsequent oxidation steps to maleic anhydride. The catalyst's structure, with isolated vanadium centers in a phosphate matrix, appears key to its selectivity and activity.

Importantly, once the initial C-H activation occurs, the subsequent oxidation steps proceed much more rapidly. This leads to quick transformation of intermediates to the final maleic anhydride product before they can desorb from the catalyst surface.

The industrial implementation of this catalyst system involves fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed reactors. Special treatments are used to give the catalyst sufficient mechanical strength without requiring a support material, which may help maintain the isolation of active sites.

While this example focuses on butane oxidation, the principles of using isolated metal centers for selective C-H activation could potentially be applied to improve the oxidation of other alkanes as well.

正丁烷氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行烷烃选择性氧化的一个重要工业实例。这个过程使用钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂，该催化剂已经被广泛研究。

在这个反应中，正丁烷中C-H键的活化被认为是反应的决速步骤。虽然给定文本中没有详细描述确切的机制，但它可能涉及金属氧化物催化剂典型的Mars-van Krevelen过程或氢抽提过程。

钒焦磷酸盐催化剂在选择性活化烷烃(正丁烷)的同时还能促进后续氧化步骤生成顺丁烯二酸酐，这一特性是独特的。催化剂的结构，即磷酸盐基质中的孤立钒中心，似乎是其选择性和活性的关键。

重要的是，一旦初始C-H活化发生，后续的氧化步骤会进行得更快。这导致中间体快速转化为最终的顺丁烯二酸酐产品，而不会从催化剂表面脱附。

这种催化剂系统的工业实施涉及固定床、移动床或流化床反应器。使用特殊处理来赋予催化剂足够的机械强度，而无需支撑材料，这可能有助于维持活性位点的隔离。

虽然这个例子集中在正丁烷氧化上，但使用孤立金属中心进行选择性C-H活化的原理可能也适用于改进其他烷烃的氧化。

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a key industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst, which has a specific crystal structure with exposed (001) planes that are crucial for its catalytic activity.

The mechanism involves several steps, with the initial C-H bond activation of butane being the rate-determining step. This is followed by sequential oxidation steps to form intermediates like butenes, butadiene, and furan before finally producing maleic anhydride. 

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, it does mention that the catalyst's ability to activate the paraffin with high selectivity is a key property. This suggests that the catalyst's surface oxygen species play a crucial role in the initial C-H bond activation, which is consistent with a Mars van Krevelen type mechanism.

The catalyst's preparation and activation procedures are critical for achieving the desired crystal structure and surface properties. Factors such as the P/V ratio, synthesis conditions, and activation procedures all influence the catalyst's performance by affecting the exposure of active sites and the oxidation state of vanadium.

This example demonstrates how the principles of C-H activation by isolated metal centers are applied in industrial catalysis, showing the importance of catalyst structure, composition, and preparation in achieving selective oxidation of alkanes.

丁烷到马来酸酐的转化是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行烷烃选择性氧化的一个重要工业示例。这个过程使用钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂，它具有特定的晶体结构，暴露的(001)平面对其催化活性至关重要。

该机制涉及几个步骤，其中丁烷的初始C-H键活化是速率决定步骤。随后是连续的氧化步骤，形成中间体如丁烯、丁二烯和呋喃，最终产生马来酸酐。

虽然文档没有明确讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽取机制，但它确实提到催化剂高选择性活化烷烃的能力是一个关键特性。这表明催化剂表面的氧物种在初始C-H键活化中起着关键作用，这与Mars van Krevelen类型的机制一致。

催化剂的制备和活化程序对于获得所需的晶体结构和表面性质至关重要。P/V比率、合成条件和活化程序等因素都通过影响活性位点的暴露和钒的氧化态来影响催化剂的性能。

这个例子展示了孤立金属中心C-H活化原理如何应用于工业催化，显示了催化剂结构、组成和制备在实现烷烃选择性氧化中的重要性。

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a key industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. The process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst, which is the only successfully commercialized catalyst for this reaction.

The mechanism likely involves both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, though the exact details are not fully elucidated. The reaction is believed to proceed through several intermediates including butenes, butadiene, and furan, though these are not typically observed due to kinetic factors. The initial C-H bond activation of butane is the rate-determining step.

Key factors influencing catalyst performance include the preparation method, phosphorus to vanadium (P/V) ratio, presence of additives, and activation/conditioning procedures. These parameters affect the catalyst structure and surface properties, which in turn impact its ability to selectively activate C-H bonds.

The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst demonstrates remarkable selectivity in converting butane directly to maleic anhydride without producing significant amounts of intermediate products. This highlights the catalyst's ability to efficiently perform multiple oxidation steps once the initial C-H activation occurs.

While the exact mechanism remains debated, the industrial success of this process demonstrates how isolated metal centers on oxide supports can be leveraged for selective alkane oxidation through careful catalyst design and reaction engineering.

丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行选择性氧化烷烃的一个重要工业实例。该过程使用钒酰焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂,这是唯一成功商业化用于该反应的催化剂。

该机理可能涉及Mars van Krevelen和氢抽提过程,尽管确切细节尚未完全阐明。反应被认为通过几个中间体进行,包括丁烯、丁二烯和呋喃,但由于动力学因素,这些中间体通常不被观察到。丁烷的初始C-H键活化是决速步骤。

影响催化剂性能的关键因素包括制备方法、磷与钒(P/V)比例、添加剂的存在以及活化/调节程序。这些参数影响催化剂的结构和表面性质,进而影响其选择性活化C-H键的能力。

钒酰焦磷酸盐催化剂在将丁烷直接转化为顺丁烯二酸酐时表现出显著的选择性,而不产生大量中间产物。这突出了催化剂在初始C-H活化发生后能够有效进行多个氧化步骤的能力。

虽然确切的机理仍有争议,但这一工艺在工业上的成功表明,通过仔细的催化剂设计和反应工程,可以利用氧化物支撑物上的孤立金属中心进行选择性烷烃氧化。

The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a key example of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. The catalyst used in this process is vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), which contains isolated vanadium centers.

The mechanism likely involves both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, though the exact details are not fully specified in the given text. The reaction proceeds through several intermediates, with the initial C-H bond activation of n-butane being the rate-determining step. This is evidenced by the much faster oxidation rate of 1-butene compared to n-butane.

The catalytic behavior depends on several factors, including the preparation method, P/V ratio, additives, and activation/conditioning procedures. These factors influence the structure and properties of the catalyst, which in turn affect its ability to selectively activate C-H bonds.

The industrial process uses fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed reactors, all employing the same (VO)2P2O7 catalyst. This demonstrates the unique effectiveness of this catalyst in facilitating the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.

While the text does not provide explicit details on the C-H activation mechanism, it is clear that the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst plays a crucial role in enabling this selective oxidation process at an industrial scale.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does discuss the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example.

For the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride:

1. The catalyst used is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7, which is unsupported and has special treatments to develop mechanical strength.

2. The mechanism involves several steps, including oxidative dehydrogenation, allylic oxidation, and oxygen insertion reactions. However, intermediates are not observed under usual reaction conditions due to kinetic reasons.

3. The rate-determining step is the initial activation of butane. Subsequent steps occur much faster, leading to quick transformation of intermediates to maleic anhydride.

4. The literature raises questions about the mechanism of paraffin activation, including whether it involves abstraction of H-, H, or H+ donation, but does not provide definitive answers.

5. The selectivity of the reaction is likely related to the mechanism of activation, but this relationship is not explicitly explained in the given text.

6. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not specifically mentioned in the provided literature for this reaction.

While the document provides some insights into the industrial process and reaction mechanism, it does not directly address how isolated metal centers facilitate C-H bond activation or the specific mechanisms involved in these processes.
