[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[3] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[4] "A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported in Table 2."

[5] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is a key example of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. The catalyst used in this process is vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), which contains isolated vanadium centers.

The mechanism likely involves both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, though the exact details are not fully specified in the given text. The reaction proceeds through several intermediates, with the initial C-H bond activation of n-butane being the rate-determining step. This is evidenced by the much faster oxidation rate of 1-butene compared to n-butane.

The catalytic behavior depends on several factors, including the preparation method, P/V ratio, additives, and activation/conditioning procedures. These factors influence the structure and properties of the catalyst, which in turn affect its ability to selectively activate C-H bonds.

The industrial process uses fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed reactors, all employing the same (VO)2P2O7 catalyst. This demonstrates the unique effectiveness of this catalyst in facilitating the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.

While the text does not provide explicit details on the C-H activation mechanism, it is clear that the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst plays a crucial role in enabling this selective oxidation process at an industrial scale.

正丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行烷烃选择性氧化的工业应用的一个重要例子。这个过程中使用的催化剂是钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)，其中含有孤立的钒中心。

反应机理可能涉及Mars van Krevelen和氢抽提过程，尽管给定的文本中没有详细说明具体细节。反应通过几个中间体进行，其中正丁烷的初始C-H键活化是速率决定步骤。这一点从1-丁烯的氧化速率远快于正丁烷可以得到证实。

催化行为取决于几个因素，包括制备方法、P/V比例、添加剂以及活化/调节程序。这些因素影响催化剂的结构和性质，进而影响其选择性活化C-H键的能力。

工业过程使用固定床、移动床或流化床反应器，所有反应器都采用相同的(VO)2P2O7催化剂。这表明该催化剂在促进正丁烷选择性氧化为马来酸酐方面具有独特的效果。

虽然文本没有提供C-H活化机理的明确细节，但很明显，钒焦磷酸盐催化剂在实现这一选择性氧化过程的工业规模应用中起着至关重要的作用。
