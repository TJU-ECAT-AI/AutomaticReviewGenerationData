[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. Knowledge of the type of active sites and the features of the activation mechanism that allow high selectivity to be obtained can be useful in improving selectivity and activity in the oxidation of other paraffins."

[3] "Fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P2O7, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "A peculiarity of the catalyst is that no support has been used. The necessary mechanical strength has been developed by (1) special treatment of the catalyst and addition of a small amount of promoters, (2) embedding the precursor with Zr and Ti pyrophosphate in fluid-bed technologies, or (3) encapsulating the precursor in a shell of silica in moving-bed technology."

[5] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 20-25 to 60 times higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

The oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride is an important industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst, which has been extensively studied.

The activation of the C-H bond in butane is believed to be the rate-determining step in this reaction. While the exact mechanism is not fully detailed in the given text, it likely involves Mars-van Krevelen or hydrogen abstraction processes typical of metal oxide catalysts. 

The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst is unique in its ability to selectively activate the paraffin (butane) while also facilitating the subsequent oxidation steps to maleic anhydride. The catalyst's structure, with isolated vanadium centers in a phosphate matrix, appears key to its selectivity and activity.

Importantly, once the initial C-H activation occurs, the subsequent oxidation steps proceed much more rapidly. This leads to quick transformation of intermediates to the final maleic anhydride product before they can desorb from the catalyst surface.

The industrial implementation of this catalyst system involves fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed reactors. Special treatments are used to give the catalyst sufficient mechanical strength without requiring a support material, which may help maintain the isolation of active sites.

While this example focuses on butane oxidation, the principles of using isolated metal centers for selective C-H activation could potentially be applied to improve the oxidation of other alkanes as well.

正丁烷氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行烷烃选择性氧化的一个重要工业实例。这个过程使用钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂，该催化剂已经被广泛研究。

在这个反应中，正丁烷中C-H键的活化被认为是反应的决速步骤。虽然给定文本中没有详细描述确切的机制，但它可能涉及金属氧化物催化剂典型的Mars-van Krevelen过程或氢抽提过程。

钒焦磷酸盐催化剂在选择性活化烷烃(正丁烷)的同时还能促进后续氧化步骤生成顺丁烯二酸酐，这一特性是独特的。催化剂的结构，即磷酸盐基质中的孤立钒中心，似乎是其选择性和活性的关键。

重要的是，一旦初始C-H活化发生，后续的氧化步骤会进行得更快。这导致中间体快速转化为最终的顺丁烯二酸酐产品，而不会从催化剂表面脱附。

这种催化剂系统的工业实施涉及固定床、移动床或流化床反应器。使用特殊处理来赋予催化剂足够的机械强度，而无需支撑材料，这可能有助于维持活性位点的隔离。

虽然这个例子集中在正丁烷氧化上，但使用孤立金属中心进行选择性C-H活化的原理可能也适用于改进其他烷烃的氧化。
