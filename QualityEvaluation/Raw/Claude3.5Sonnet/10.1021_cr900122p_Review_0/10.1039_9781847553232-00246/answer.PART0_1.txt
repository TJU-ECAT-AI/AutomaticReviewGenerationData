The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a key industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. This process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst, which has a specific crystal structure with exposed (001) planes that are crucial for its catalytic activity.

The mechanism involves several steps, with the initial C-H bond activation of butane being the rate-determining step. This is followed by sequential oxidation steps to form intermediates like butenes, butadiene, and furan before finally producing maleic anhydride. 

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, it does mention that the catalyst's ability to activate the paraffin with high selectivity is a key property. This suggests that the catalyst's surface oxygen species play a crucial role in the initial C-H bond activation, which is consistent with a Mars van Krevelen type mechanism.

The catalyst's preparation and activation procedures are critical for achieving the desired crystal structure and surface properties. Factors such as the P/V ratio, synthesis conditions, and activation procedures all influence the catalyst's performance by affecting the exposure of active sites and the oxidation state of vanadium.

This example demonstrates how the principles of C-H activation by isolated metal centers are applied in industrial catalysis, showing the importance of catalyst structure, composition, and preparation in achieving selective oxidation of alkanes.

丁烷到马来酸酐的转化是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行烷烃选择性氧化的一个重要工业示例。这个过程使用钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂，它具有特定的晶体结构，暴露的(001)平面对其催化活性至关重要。

该机制涉及几个步骤，其中丁烷的初始C-H键活化是速率决定步骤。随后是连续的氧化步骤，形成中间体如丁烯、丁二烯和呋喃，最终产生马来酸酐。

虽然文档没有明确讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽取机制，但它确实提到催化剂高选择性活化烷烃的能力是一个关键特性。这表明催化剂表面的氧物种在初始C-H键活化中起着关键作用，这与Mars van Krevelen类型的机制一致。

催化剂的制备和活化程序对于获得所需的晶体结构和表面性质至关重要。P/V比率、合成条件和活化程序等因素都通过影响活性位点的暴露和钒的氧化态来影响催化剂的性能。

这个例子展示了孤立金属中心C-H活化原理如何应用于工业催化，显示了催化剂结构、组成和制备在实现烷烃选择性氧化中的重要性。
