[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production"

[3] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[5] "A generally accepted reaction pattern is reported in Table 2."

[6] "None of these intermediates is observed among the reaction products under usual reaction conditions. This raises a doubt about the validity of the proposed mechanism; however, the absence of intermediate products can be justified simply by kinetic reasons."

[7] "The rate-determining step is the first one. Indeed, the initial rate of oxidation of 1-butene is from 2045 to 60 times2 higher than that of n-butane. This may result in the quick transformation of the intermediates to maleic anhydride before any desorption of the former may occur."

The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a key industrial example of selective oxidation of alkanes using isolated metal centers on oxide materials. The process uses vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) as the catalyst, which is the only successfully commercialized catalyst for this reaction.

The mechanism likely involves both Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes, though the exact details are not fully elucidated. The reaction is believed to proceed through several intermediates including butenes, butadiene, and furan, though these are not typically observed due to kinetic factors. The initial C-H bond activation of butane is the rate-determining step.

Key factors influencing catalyst performance include the preparation method, phosphorus to vanadium (P/V) ratio, presence of additives, and activation/conditioning procedures. These parameters affect the catalyst structure and surface properties, which in turn impact its ability to selectively activate C-H bonds.

The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst demonstrates remarkable selectivity in converting butane directly to maleic anhydride without producing significant amounts of intermediate products. This highlights the catalyst's ability to efficiently perform multiple oxidation steps once the initial C-H activation occurs.

While the exact mechanism remains debated, the industrial success of this process demonstrates how isolated metal centers on oxide supports can be leveraged for selective alkane oxidation through careful catalyst design and reaction engineering.

丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐是使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行选择性氧化烷烃的一个重要工业实例。该过程使用钒酰焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)作为催化剂,这是唯一成功商业化用于该反应的催化剂。

该机理可能涉及Mars van Krevelen和氢抽提过程,尽管确切细节尚未完全阐明。反应被认为通过几个中间体进行,包括丁烯、丁二烯和呋喃,但由于动力学因素,这些中间体通常不被观察到。丁烷的初始C-H键活化是决速步骤。

影响催化剂性能的关键因素包括制备方法、磷与钒(P/V)比例、添加剂的存在以及活化/调节程序。这些参数影响催化剂的结构和表面性质,进而影响其选择性活化C-H键的能力。

钒酰焦磷酸盐催化剂在将丁烷直接转化为顺丁烯二酸酐时表现出显著的选择性,而不产生大量中间产物。这突出了催化剂在初始C-H活化发生后能够有效进行多个氧化步骤的能力。

虽然确切的机理仍有争议,但这一工艺在工业上的成功表明,通过仔细的催化剂设计和反应工程,可以利用氧化物支撑物上的孤立金属中心进行选择性烷烃氧化。
