The exchange behaviour of a series of alkanes, including cycloalkanes, with deuterium over y- 
alumina has been investigated. Different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule are 
found to exchange 
at different 
rates and in some cases a quantitative 
estimate of the relative activities 
has been made. These results and a comparison of reaction rates of different 
molecules indicate that 
the reaction 
intermediates 
are carbanionic 
in character. A linear relation between hydrogen 
exchange 
activity and hydrocarbon acidity has been obtained and is shown to be an example of the Brsnsted 
catalysis law. 
All the exchange reactions took place in a stepwise 
manner and, for the cycloalkanes, exchange 
could be followed at lower temperatures without complication from isomerization and addition. 
Recent results suggest that the intermediates in the exchange of butanes over 
y-alumina possess carbanionic character. The present work which involves the 
examination 
of the exchange 
reactions of a series of acyclic and cyclic alkanes seeks to 
relate rates of reaction to the stabilities of the carbanions formed from the respective 
molecules. 
Larson and Hall investigated the exchange reactions of methane over alumina. 
The reactions were catalyzed by a small number of active sites and involved exchange 
with only 1 % of the catalyst hydroxyl groups. Ethane is reported to exchange on 
alumina via a stepwise me~hanism.~ 
Lewis acidity was found to be the property of 
the alumina catalyst which best correlated with its activity for the exchange of pro- 
pane.4 In addition, reducing centres on the surface played an essential role in the 
reaction. 
?-Alumina is reported to be an excellent catalyst for the exchange of cyclopro- 
pane. 
Isomerization and hydrogenation reactions are not extensive and the catalyst 
has been used to prepare [2H6]cyclopropane 
of high isotopic purity. 
In this work the exchange 
reactions of five acyclic and four cyclic alkanes 
have been 
studied. Information concerning reaction intermediates has been obtained not only 
from relative rates of exchange of the various reactants, but also from the reactivities 
of 
different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule. 
In previous work only one hydrocarbon has been investigated in any one experi- 
ment. An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass 
spectro- 
metry (g.c.-m.s.) 6 v  
has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a 
series of reactants simultaneously. It has, therefore, been possible to obtain relative 
rates of exchange for different alkanes over the same catalyst sample, thereby elimin- 
ating possible problems of reproducibility of catalytic performance. In addition the 
exchange 
of cycloalkanes 
with deuterium may readily be studied even if other reactions 
take place. Using g.c.-m.s. the processes of addition, exchange and isomerization 
may be followed simultaneously.

ALKANE EXCHANGE O N  ALUMINA 
EXPERIMENTAL 
A P P A R A T U S  AND PROCEDURE 
Exchange reactions involving a single reactant were followed in a conventional manner 
using a direct capillary leak from the reaction vessel to an A.E.I. MSlO mass spectrometer. 
Mass spectral 
analyses of the hydrocarbon products were carried out for the parent ions using 
an electron beam of energy 10eV. With the exception of experiments involving cyclo- 
propane and methylcyclopropane when 0.1 g samples of catalyst were used the usual pro- 
cedure was to treat 1 
.O g y-alumina in oxygen at 723 K prior to evacuation at this temperature 
for at least 15 h. The reaction mixture usually consisted of 0.96 kN m-2 hydrocarbon and 
9.5 kN m-' deuterium 
in a silica reaction vessel, giving ca. 3 x 1019 
molecules of hydrocarbon 
in the reaction vessel. Exceptions to these proportions are indicated in the Results section. 
In experiments involving more than one reactant hydrocarbon or in those in which a 
single reactant could exhibit different reactions, the standard mass spectrometric method 
proved inadequate. In such cases the combined g.c.-m.s. apparatus linked to an " 
on-line " 
computer 6 v  
was employed. Separation of acyclic alkanes was achieved using an 8 m 
column of bis-2-methoxyethyl adipate (13.5 %) and di-2ethylhexyl sebacate (6.5 %) on 
60/80 mesh Chromosorb P, operating at 273 K for C1 
to C3 
alkanes and at room temperature 
for higher alkanes. Cycloalkanes 
and their isornerization products were separated on a 
4 m 
column of propylene carbonate on 60/80 mesh Chromosorb P operating at 273 K. This 
column was also used to separate the components of the cyclobutane and n-butane mixture. 
For experiments followed by g.c.-ms., the reaction mixtures were chosen to give approxi- 
mately the same number (3 x 1019) 
of hydrocarbon molecules and the same total pressure in 
the reaction system as for those experiments followed by mass spectrometry alone. The 
catalyst received the same pretreatment. 
The method of data acquisition was identical to that described previously ' 
except that 
the use of reference 
masses 18,28 and 32 proved inadequate for the accurate analysis of mass 
spectra of C3 
and C4 alkanes. It was found necessary to employ reference masses such that 
the mass range of interest was included, thereby permitting mass numbers to be assigned by 
an interpolation method. Two techniques were available for the production of suitable 
reference masses. First, liquid phase bleed from the chromatographic column sometimes 
gave rise to a suitable reference spectrum. Second, when this was not the case, a reference 
spectrum was obtained by insertion into the mass spectrometer of a hydrocarbon with a 
known fragmentation pattern, e.g. o-xylene. This procedure was carried out before the 
start of an experiment and all traces of the hydrocarbon allowed to evacuate from the system 
before collecting further spectra. 
MATERIALS 
The y-alumina was prepared by heating a high purity boehmite (Laporte Industries Ltd.) 
at 900 K in air for 16 h. The specific surface area, determined by nitrogen adsorption at 
77 K, was 120 
m2 
g-'. 
All hydrocarbons and deuterium were of high purity. The hydrocarbons were distilled 
from traps held in liquid nitrogen before use while the deuterium was purified by diffusion 
through a heated palladium-silver alloy thimble. The cyclobutane sample was a mixture of 
approximately 
equal amounts of cyclobutane and n-butane and was without prior separation 
of the individual components. 
TREATMENT OF RESULTS 
Mass spectra were corrected 
for the presence of background peaks, for naturally occurring 
deuterium and " 
heavy " 
carbon and for fragmentation in the mass spectrometer sowce. 
When the exchange reaction was not followed past the initial stages, the fragmentation was 
assumed to involve statistical 
loss of hydrogen and deuterium from the molecule. However, 
if extensive exchange was involved the method of Dowie et aL9 was used. A further modi- 
fication in the usual fragmentation correction procedure was required for analysis of highly

deuterated isobutane. In the mass spectrometer the most likely hydrogen atom to be lost 
after initial ionization of the molecule is that of the methine group, which as results indicate 
had little chance of being a deuterium atom. Thus it was assumed that the fragment pro- 
duced by loss of one hydrogen atom was always one mass unit less than its parent ion. 
Fragmentation by loss of hydrogen (or deuterium) from other positions in the molecule was 
considered in the usual manner. 
In the exchange reactions where all the hydrogen atoms of the reactant exchanged at the 
same rate standard 
methods lo 
were used to determine 
the initial rate for deuterium entry (k4) 
and loss of the [2Ho]-isomer 
(ko). Values of the parameter M(= k&/k,) 
were calculated to 
determine the multiplicity of the exchange process. 
However, for some hydrocarbons 
different 
types o
f
 
hydrogen 
atoms exchanged at different 
rates. To analyse the data in these cases a method 
involving approximations 
in the stand- 
ard treatment was required. The exchange in different groups of hydrogen atoms was 
considered separately and equations analogous to those devised by Kemball lo were derived. 
This method is known to be satisfactory if the ratio of rate constants for exchange in the 
different groups is greater than 5 : 
1. 
Initial rates for isomerization, k~ were calculated where appropriate assuming first order 
loss of reactant. 
RESULTS 
EXCHANGE OF ACYCLIC ALKANES 
Some general points emerged for all the experiments involving the individual 
exchange of a reactant. All reactions followed the usual equations for exchange 
processes lo 
and all gave A
4
 values near unity, indicating the stepwise nature of the 
exchange. All rates quoted subsequently are k4 values and the derived Arrhenius 
parameters are given in table 1. Since certain reactants exhibited exchange of differ- 
ent groups of hydrogen atoms at different rates (see below) the data in table 1 refer to 
the most active hydrogen atoms. The uncertainty in values of the activation energy 
E is estimated as +4 
kJ mol-1 ; that in the log A values is k0.6.

The most interesting aspect of the exchange of n-butane was that six of the hydro- 
gen atoms in the molecule were exchanged more readily than the other four, the 
distribution of isotopic species as a function of time showing a marked discontinuity 
between the appearance of the [2H6]- 
and [2H7]-isomers. Exchange in the second 
group of hydrogen atoms was studied in greater detail by using a higher deuterium : 
hydrocarbon ratio of 25 : 1. Analysis of the results indicated that the methyl 
hydrogen atoms in n-butane (type A) exchanged about sixty times faster than those in

culate theoretical isotopic distributions at various times for molecules in which 
different groups of atoms exchanged at different rates. By specifying that type A 
hydrogen atoms exchanged sixty times faster than type B (i.e. kA/kB 
= 60) a set of 
distributions was generated for n-butane such that for similar extents of exchange 
experimental and calculated distributions could be compared (table 2). Also shown 
in table 2 is the binomial distribution Calculated for ten equally reactive hydrogen 
atoms.

2 % of the [2Hlo]-species 
should be present in the product mixture. This quantity 
would certainly have been detectable in the mass spectrometer and thus for isobutane 
we estimate that kA/kB 
> 100. 
Results for the simultaneous exchange of the alkanes are summarised in table 4. 
A mixture of methane, ethane and propane was reacted with deuterium at 308 K and 
a mixture of propane, n-butane and isobutane was reacted at 290K. The rates 
derived from the results of these experiments are listed together with those obtained 
in the individual exchange experiments. 
EXCHANGE OF CYCLIC ALKANES 
All the cycloalkanes studied underwent exchange by a stepwise mechanism. 
Cyclopropane and methylcyclopropane were the most reactive molecules and kinetic 
data are given in table 1. Also included in the table is an 
indication of the temperature 
required to give an isomerization rate in excess of 1013 
molecule s-l m-2. 
The exchange of cyclopropane was followed in the temperature range 250-290 K 
when all the hydrogen atoms were found to exchange 
readily and at the same rate. A 
temperature of 358 K was required before the production of propylene was observed 
and at this temperature the rate of exchange 
was more than 1000 times that of isomer- 
ization. 
Interesting results were obtained in the exchange of methylcyclopropane. The 
eight hydrogen atoms could be classified into three groups A, B and C according to 
their different rates of exchange. The four hydrogens at the C(2) and C(3) positions 
(type A) were the most reactive, followed by the single ring hydrogen at the substi- 
tuted C(l) position (type B). The least active were those atoms in the methyl group 
(type C). The ratio of rate constants kA 
: 
kB 
was ca. 10 : 
1 at room temperature. 
The type C hydrogen atoms did not appear to exchange 
even at temperatures in excess 
of 350 K. The rate of exchange of the type A hydrogen atoms at 287 K (1.3 x 1015 
molecule s-l m-2) was very similar to that of the hydrogen atoms in cyclopropane 
itself (1.4 x 1015 
molecule s-1 m-2) measured at the same temperature. A temper- 
ature of 355 K was required in order to achieve isomerization 
at a measurable rate, the 
initial product being trans-but-2-ene. At this temperature, the rate of isomerization 
was ca. 100 times slower than that of the exchange of type B hydrogens. 
The exchange of cyclobutane was studied using a reaction mixture consisting of 
cyclobutane and n-butane in approximately equal amounts. All the hydrogen 
atoms in cyclobutane 
exchanged at the same rate in the temperature range 273-355 K. 
Even at the high temperatures in this range only a trace of butene could be detected 
and the rate of isomerization was at least 150 times slower than that of exchange. 
In the exchange of cyclopentane 
all the hydrogens reacted at an equal rate and in a 
stepwise manner. 
DISCUSSION 
The rate of exchange 
of methane with deuterium on our alumina catalyst 
(4.0 x 1313 
molecule s-l m-2 at 301 K) is somewhat slower than that found by Larson and 
Hall 2* 26 (3.6 
x 1014 
molecule s-l m-2 at 301 K) but a higher pretreatment temper- 
ature was employed in their work. For the exchange of propane at 293 K, Flock- 
hart et aL4 found a rate of 1.1 x lo1 molecule s-l m-2 for an alumina catalyst pre- 
treated at the temperature used in the present work (723 K). Using the pressure 
dependencies quoted we would expect their catalyst to show a rate of 2.7 x 1013 
molecule s-' 
in our system and this compares favourably with the observed rate 
of 1.6 x 1013 
molecule s-l m-2. Our observation of the relative rates of exchange

ALKANE EXCHANGE ON 
ALUMINA 
of the different hydrogen atoms in propane does however disagree with the suggestion 
of Flockhart et aL4 that the secondary hydrogen atoms are more rapidly replaced. 
It has been shown ' 
that in the exchange of methane with deuterium over alumina, 
the rate determining step involves fission of a C-H 
bond and it seems very probable 
that dissociative 
adsorption is involved for all the alkanes studied in the present work. 
It has been 
established lo, 13* l4 that the adsorption of saturated hydrocarbons to form surface 
alkyl species plays an important part in the exchange process on metal catalysts. Fig. 
1 shows that for the exchange of alkanes on tungsten there exists a rough correlation 
between the ease of exchange and the dissociation energy of the alkyl-hydrogen bond 
which must necessarily be broken to produce the adsorbed alkyl groups. In particu- 
lar, the high bond dissociation energy of the C-H bond of methane results in a rate of 
exchange 
which is about 1000 
times slower than that of the other alkanes. In contrast, 
on y-alumina, methane exchanges as readily as the other alkanes and no such distinc- 
distinction in behaviour is observed. In addition, the most weakly bound hydrogen 
atoms in isobutane (the methine hydrogen) and in n-butane (the secondary hydrogen 
atoms) are the least active for exchange. For the cycloalkanes the observed rate of 
reaction decreases in the sequence : 
cyclopropane % cyclobutane > cyclopentane 
and this order is the reverse of that expected for radical intermediates since the bond 
dissociation energies l 6  are 431, 414 and 397 kJ mol-1 for cyclopropane, cyclobutane 
and cyclo 
pen 
t 
ane respectively 
. 
It seems unlikely that the alkanes exchange via radical intermediates.

Exchange via carbonium ion or partially positively charged intermediates may 
also be ruled out. Exchange of saturated hydrocarbons on silica-alumina 
is generally 
regarded as involving carbonium ion intermediates. On silica-alumina isobutane 
will exchange at 393 K l7 but n-butane requires a temperature in excess of 550 K. 
In contrast, on y-alumina at room temperature the two butane molecules undergo 
exchange at similar rates. A much higher rate would be expected for isobutane if 
formation of tertiary carbonium ion were important for exchange. 
The general behaviour of the alkanes on alumina suggests that the intermediate 
species are adsorbed alkyl groups which possess carbanionic character. Many of the 
differences in reactivities can be qualitatively explained by consideration of the

effects of alkyl substituents on the stabilities of carbanions. Alkyl group replacement 
of hydrogen in methane leads to a decrease in the stability of the carbanion as a result 
of the electron releasing nature of the substituent e.g. the ethyl carbanions CH,CH, 
would be less stable than the methyl anion CH,, and indeed the exchange rate for 
ethane is lower than that observed for methane. Increasing the length of the alkyl 
chain tends to decrease the degree of destabilization [see for example ref. (18)] such 
that the anion CH3CH2CHi 
is more stable than CH,CH;. 
This is in accord with 
the observation that propane exchanges at a greater rate than ethane. 
The operation of such inductive effects can also assist in explaining the different 
reactivities found for various groups of hydrogen atoms in the same molecule. For 
both propane and n-butane, the methylene hydrogen atoms exchanged much more 
slowly than the primary hydrogen atoms, the effect being more marked in the case of 
propane. The (CH,),CH- carbanion has two methyl groups adjacent to the central 
carbon atom on which the negative charge is visualized and thus there is a pronounced 
destabilizing influence. The magnitude of the effect is reduced in the carbanion 
(CH3)(C2H5)CH- formed from n-butane since, in this case, one of the substituent 
groups is larger and therefore less destabilizing. By similar reasoning it can be seen 
why the methine hydrogen in isobutane is very inactive for exchange; the inductive 
effect of three substituent methyl groups causes the (CH3)3C- ion to be particularly 
unstable. 
It would be useful to attempt a more quantitative correlation between alkane 
exchange activity and carbanion stability. If this is the major factor in determining 
the reactivity of the alkanes the rate determining step which occurs on the surface 
may be written

where DRH 
is the bond dissociation energy of the alkyl-hydrogen bond which is broken 
in the adsorption process, E R  is the electron affinity of the alkyl radical and ZH is the 
ionization potential of the hydrogen atom. For a series of alkanes, provided that the 
respective carbanionic species are equally strongly adsorbed the ease of occurrence of 
reaction (1) will be determined by the value of ( D R H - E R ) .  
Unfortunately precise 
values of ER 
for the radicals under discussion are not known at 
present, reported values 
often having an uncertainty exceeding several tenths of an electron-~olt.~~ 
Such a 
degree of uncertainty precludes the assessment of relative carbanion stabilities based 
on thermochemical data. Indeed catalytic studies similar to those reported here may 
have some value in assessing relative values of electron affinities for hydrocarbon and 
other radicals. 
It is more fruitful to consider the reactivities of the alkanes as a function of hydro- 
carbon acidity. As with electron affinity data, the assignments of pKa values for such 
weak acids is not without question. The pK, values used in this work have been 
derived from equilibrium studies by Dessy et aL20 and Cram.21 Dessy et aL20 have 
argued that in establishing a rank of carbanion stabilities the use of kinetic acidity 
values is not to be recommended. 
Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the exchange activity of alkanes and their pKa 
values where these are known. The rate constants used in the figure are taken from 
the data of table 1 except for the secondary hydrogen atoms in propane and n-butane.

where kA denotes the rate constant observed for the catalyzed reaction, K is the 
dissociation constant of the acid, G A  is a constant and CI is a parameter taking values 
between zero and unity and indicates the sensitivity of the catalysis to the acid 
strength.23 As Bell 22 has indicated, the Brarnsted relationship, although normally 
applied to the catalysis of a given reaction by a series of acid catalysts, is also expected 
to hold for the case where one catalyst is used with a series of acid reactants. Thus a, 
the sensitivity factor of the Brarnsted equation (8) is analogous to the parameter a 
in 
eqn (5). For the acyclic molecules a = 0.63, but for the cycloalkanes the dependence 
of exchange rate on pK, is less marked with a = 0.38. Thus it is clear that an addi- 
tional factor influences the activity of the cycloalkanes and causes an enhancement in 
the rate of exchange, particularly for cyclobutane and cyclopentane. The origin of the 
increased rate of exchange is difficult to explain. Burwell et aZ.24 
have attributed the 
enhanced rate of exchange of cyclopropane on chromia to the operation of a hyper- 
conjugative effect. It is unlikely that such an effect is present in exchange on alumina 
since cyclopropane is only marginally faster in exchange than predicted on the basis of 
the rate-acidity relationship for acyclic molecules (fig. 2). This close agreement also 
precludes the attribution of high exchange rates in cycloalkanes to enhanced chemi- 
sorption via n-bonding interaction with the catalyst surface. The absence of n- 
bonding influences is also confirmed by the fact that the relative exchange activity of 
ethylene is satisfactorily explained by acidity alone. We must therefore conclude 
that an effect operates which enables the hydrogen atoms in cyclobutane and cyclo- 
pentane to be more accessible. The origin of this effect may possibly lie in the orient- 
ation of the adsorbed reactant at the surface but a deeper understanding must await 
the results of further experimentation. 
The linear free energy relationship depicted in fig. 2 demonstrates that alkanes 
exchange on alumina via the formation of adsorbed alkyl groups with carbanionic 
character and that exchange activity is largely controlled by hydrocarbon acidity. 
The extension of this idea to include ethylene is in accord with the dissociative mech- 
anism for ethylene exchange proposed by Hightower and Hall.25 The work demon- 
strates the importance of the electronic charge of reactive intermediates on catalytic 
processes occurring on alumina.' 
In addition we may use the relationship to provide pK, values for the methyl 
hydrogen atoms in the butane molecules, since these are not included in the data from 
ref. (20) and (21). Both n-butane and isobutane exhibit similar rates of exchange 
(tables 1 and 4) and we calculate the pK, value for the primary hydrogens in both 
molecules as approximately 39. 
The results of the experiments in which more than one alkane underwent simul- 
taneous exchange over the same catalyst indicate that the reaction rates were little 
affected by the presence of other alkanes. Results were also free from effects due to 
dilution of the deuterium pool which might have occurred, for example, if a large 
hydrocarbon underwent rapid exchange in competition with smaller and less reactive 
molecules. The applicability of g.c.-m.s. to competitive studies of catalytic reactions 
is thus demonstrated.
