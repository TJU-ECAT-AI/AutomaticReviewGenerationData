This contribution is an in-depth review of chemical and technological aspects of the
alkylation of isobutanewith light alkenes,focused on the mechanisms operative with both liquid

discussed in terms of the physical–chemical properties of speciﬁc catalysts. The impact of
important process parameters on alkylation performance is deduced from the mechanism. The
established industrial processes based on the application of liquid acids and recent process

I. Introduction
Alkylation of isobutane with C3–C5 alkenes in the presence of strong acids leads
to the formation of complex mixtures of branched alkanes, called alkylate, which
are excellent blending components for gasoline. Alkylate has a high octane

230
number and a low Reid vapor pressure, and is free of aromatics, alkenes, and
sulfur. The worldwide production capacity as of the end of 2001 was approxi-
mately 74 million tons/year (1). Because of increasing strictness of the clean air
regulations in the EU and the USA and restrictions of the contents of alkenes,
sulfur, and aromatics (particularly benzene) in gasoline, the production of
alkylate is expected to increase. Furthermore, the planned phase-out of methyl-
tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), a high-octane-number oxygenate, will boost the
demand for alkylate to meet the requirements for reformulated gasoline (2).
Alcohols such as ethanol, that could conceivably replace the ethers, suffer from a
very high blending vapor pressure when mixed into gasoline, thus limiting their
usefulness. Therefore, it is expected that the demand for alkylation catalysts will
increase by 5% per year up to the year 2003, with an estimated total catalyst value
for 2003 of $340 million (3).
The alkylation unit in a petroleum reﬁnery is situated downstream of the ﬂuid
catalytic cracking (FCC) units. The C4 cut from the FCC unit contains linear
butenes, isobutylene, n-butane, and isobutane. In some reﬁneries, isobutylene is
converted with methanol into MTBE. A typical modern reﬁnery ﬂow scheme
showing the position of the alkylation together with an acid regeneration unit is
displayed in Fig. 1.
In the 1930s, Ipatieff’s group at Universal Oil Products discovered that
isoalkanes react with alkenes in the presence of strong acids to give saturated
hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions. The acids initially tested
were AlCl3/HCl and BF3/HF (4). Soon, the ﬁrst processes were commercia-
lized (5). The early alkylation plants utilized sulfuric acid, but the need for
high-octane-number aviation gasoline spurred by World War II led to the
construction of plants based on HF as catalyst, which are more ﬂexible
regarding the feed alkenes. The ﬁrst HF alkylation process units were built in
1942 by Phillips as wartime emergency units (6). The importance of alkylate
increased steeply, and the daily production of alkylate then reached 5 million
gallons; during the Korean War in 1952 the production rate was already 14
million gallons/day, and in the beginning of the 1980s, with the phase out of
leaded gasoline in the USA, it increased to an estimated 50 million gallons/
day (7). From the 1960s to about 1986, the relative importance of plants
using HF increased relative to those using H2SO4 (8). Now, nearly equal
amounts of alkylate are produced on a worldwide basis by each of the two
processes (1).
Both H2SO4 and HF catalysts suffer from substantial drawbacks. Anhydrous
HF is a corrosive and highly toxic liquid with a boiling point close to room
temperature. Tests in the Nevada desert showed that, if released into the
atmosphere, HF forms stable aerosols, which drift downwind at ground level
for several kilometers. In 1987, the accidental release of gaseous HF in Texas
City resulted in emergency treatment for several hundred people (9). Therefore,

reﬁneries with HF alkylation plants are under pressure to install expensive
mitigation systems minimizing the dangers of HF leaks. Moreover, authorities
in many industrialized countries have ceased to license new HF alkylation
plants.
Sulfuric acid is also a corrosive liquid, but not volatile, making its handling
easier. Its major disadvantage is the high acid consumption in the alkylation
process, which can be as much as 70–100 kg of acid/ton of alkylate. The spent
acid contains water and heavy hydrocarbons and has to be regenerated, usually by
burning. The cost of such a regenerated acid is about 2–3 times the market price
for sulfuric acid (10). About one-third of the total operating costs of alkylation
units using H2SO4 can be attributed to acid consumption (11). The sulfuric acid-
catalyzed process is more sensitive than the other towards the feed alkenes; C3
and C5 alkenes generally lead to higher acid consumption and lower octane
numbers of the alkylate (12). Equipment corrosion, transport, and handling
hazards and environmental liability associated with the disposal of spent acid are
disadvantages of both the processes.
For more than 30 years, these issues have provided the driving force for
research in industry and academia to ﬁnd suitable replacements for the existing
liquid acid catalysts. Zeolites, being non-corrosive, non-toxic, and rather
inexpensive, seemed to be promising candidates, especially after they were
successfully installed as cracking catalysts. In the late 1960s, two groups, those of
Garwood and Venuto of Mobil Oil (13) and Kirsch, Potts, and Barmby of Sun
Oil (14), did pioneering work on rare earth exchanged faujasitic zeolites. Later,
other zeolites were also examined. In general, all large-pore zeolites are active
alkylation catalysts, giving product distributions similar to those characteristic of
the liquid acids, but their unacceptably rapid deactivation was and still is the
obstacle to commercialization.
Other materials that have been investigated include sulfated zirconia,
Brønsted and Lewis acids promoted on various supports, heteropolyacids, and
organic resins, both supported and unsupported. On the whole, these materials
also deactivate rapidly, and some of them also exhibit environmental and
health hazards.
The technology and chemistry of isoalkane–alkene alkylation have been
thoroughly reviewed for both liquid and solid acid catalysts (15) and for solid
acid catalysts alone (16). The intention of this review is to provide an up-to-
date overview of the alkylation reaction with both liquid and solid acids as
catalysts. The focus is on the similarities and differences between the liquid
acid catalysts on one hand and solid acid catalysts, especially zeolites, on the
other. Thus, the reaction mechanism, the physical properties of the individual
catalysts, and their consequences for successful operation are reviewed. The
ﬁnal section is an overview of existing processes and new process developments
utilizing solid acids.

II. Alkylation Mechanism
Since the discovery of alkylation, the elucidation of its mechanism has attracted
great interest. The early ﬁndings are associated with Schmerling (17–19), who
successfully applied a carbenium ion mechanism with a set of consecutive and
simultaneous reaction steps to describe the observed reaction kinetics. Later,
most of the mechanistic information about sulfuric acid-catalyzed processes was
provided by Albright. Much less information is available about hydroﬂuoric acid
as catalyst. In the following, a consolidated view of the alkylation mechanism
is presented. Similarities and dissimilarities between zeolites as representatives
of solid acid alkylation catalysts and HF and H2SO4 as liquid catalysts are high-
lighted. Experimental results are compared with quantum-chemical calculations
of the individual reaction steps in various media.
II.A. Overall Product Distribution
Table I gives the compositions of alkylates produced with various acidic catalysts.
The product distribution is similar for a variety of acidic catalysts, both solid and
liquid, and over a wide range of process conditions. Typically, alkylate is a
mixture of methyl-branched alkanes with a high content of isooctanes. Almost all
the compounds have tertiary carbon atoms; only very few have quaternary carbon
atoms or are non-branched. Alkylate contains not only the primary products,
trimethylpentanes, but also dimethylhexanes, sometimes methylheptanes, and a
considerable amount of isopentane, isohexanes, isoheptanes and hydrocarbons
with nine or more carbon atoms. The complexity of the product illustrates that no
simple and straightforward single-step mechanism is operative; rather, the
reaction involves a set of parallel and consecutive reaction steps, with the
importance of the individual steps differing markedly from one catalyst to
another. To arrive at this complex product distribution from two simple molecules
such as isobutane and butene, reaction steps such as isomerization, oligomeriza-
tion, b-scission, and hydride transfer have to be involved.
The distributions of products within a certain carbon number fraction are
far from equilibrium. In the C8-fraction, for example, the dimethylhexanes would
be thermodynamically favored over the trimethylpentanes, but the latter are
predominant. The distribution within the trimethylpentanes is also not
equilibrated. 2,2,4-TMP would prevail at equilibrium over the other TMPs,
constituting 60–70% of the product, depending on the temperature. Furthermore,
2,2,3-TMP as the primary product is found in less than equilibrium amounts.
Qualitatively, the same statement is valid for the other carbon number
distributions. Products with a tertiary carbon atom in the 2-position dominate
over other isomers in all fractions.

The overall reaction is highly exothermic. Depending on the product
composition, 82–93 kJ/mol of reacted isobutane are liberated (23).
II.B. Initiation Steps
The alkylation reaction is initiated by the activation of the alkene. With liquid
acids, the alkene forms the corresponding ester. This reaction follows
Markovnikov’s rule, so that the acid is added to the most highly substituted
carbon atom. With H2SO4, mono- and di-alkyl sulfates are produced, and with
HF alkyl ﬂuorides are produced. Triﬂic acid (CF3SO2OH) behaves in the same
way and forms alkyl triﬂates (24). These esters are stable at low temperatures and
low acid/hydrocarbon ratios. With a large excess of acid, the esters may also be
stabilized in the form of free carbenium ions and anions (Reaction (1)).
ð1Þ
The esters differ from each other in stability. To decompose the isopropyl
ester, higher temperatures and higher acid strengths are needed than for
decomposition of the s-butyl ester. It is claimed that the resulting carbenium ions
are stabilized by solvation through the acid (25–27). Branched alkenes do not
form esters. It is believed that they are easily protonated and polymerized (28).
In zeolites, the adsorption of an alkene will lead to a surface alkoxide and not
to an adsorbed carbenium ion. The alkene is “solvated” by the basic surface
oxygen atoms of the zeolite, and the solvation is similar to that by water in
aqueous solutions. Depending on the basicity of the surface oxygen atoms,
proton transfer to adsorbed alkenes results in the formation of more or less
covalent surface alkoxides rather than carbenium ions (29,30). Ab initio
quantum-chemical calculations representing a cluster modeling the zeolitic acid
site (29,31) showed that the alkene ﬁrst forms a p-complex with the acidic site.
This transforms via a carbenium ion-like transition state into the alkoxide. The
transition state has a much higher positive charge than the alkoxide, and it forms
a cyclic species with both oxygen atoms and an aluminum atom of the zeolite.
The ﬁnal alkoxide will not bind to the oxygen to which the hydrogen was
bonded but instead to one neighboring it. The involvement of both oxygen
atoms and the “switching” between them is characteristic of hydrocarbon
transformations on zeolitic acid sites (32). An illustrative energy diagram is
depicted for the isobutylene protonation in Fig. 2.
More recent calculations representing propene chemisorption, however,
showed the sensitivity of the system to the surrounding zeolite structure. The
calculated energies were found to depend strongly on the relaxation of the zeolite

237
unit cell size and its shape (33). Experimentally, monomeric alkoxides are
difﬁcult to investigate. Because of their high reactivities, alkenes tend to
oligomerize, so that mainly dimerized species were detected upon adsorption of
isobutylene and of n-butenes on zeolites (34,35).
In their experiments with perdeuterioisobutane on various zeolites, Engel-
hardt and Hall (36) found the carbenium ions to be metastable reaction
intermediates. The lifetime of an intermediate was concluded to depend on the
acid strength.
The direct protonation of isobutane, via a pentacoordinated carbonium ion, is
not likely under typical alkylation conditions. This reaction would give either a
tertiary butyl cation (trimethylcarbenium ion) and hydrogen, or a secondary
propyl cation (dimethylcarbenium ion) and methane (37–39). With zeolites, this
reaction starts to be signiﬁcant only at temperatures higher than 473 K. At lower
temperatures, the reaction has to be initiated by an alkene (40). In general, all
hydrocarbon transformations at low temperatures start with the adsorption of the
much more reactive alkenes, and alkanes enter the reaction cycles exclusively
through hydride transfer (see Section II.D).
When n-butenes are used, the initiation produces a secondary carbenium
ion/butoxide. This species may isomerize via a methyl shift (Reaction (2)) or
accept a hydride from isobutane to form the tertiary butyl cation (Reaction (3)).
Isobutylene forms the tertiary cation directly.

ð3Þ
The skeletal rearrangement needed in reaction (2) has to go through a transition
state, which resembles a primary carbenium ion, for which an activation energy
of about 130 kJ/mol has been calculated (41). In zeolites and presumably in the
liquid acids also, this reaction does not proceed under alkylation conditions.
Another possibility is the addition of a butene molecule to the secondary butyl
cation, giving a 3,4-dimethylhexyl cation, which can be freed via hydride transfer
from isobutane and form the tertiary butyl cation in this way. This route seems to
play only a minor role, as no signiﬁcantly higher dimethylhexane selectivities
during the initial reaction phase have been reported. At the same time, n-butane is
formed in substantial amounts at this stage, conﬁrming the importance of this
initiating step.
In the reaction with sulfuric acid and n-butenes or propene, only minor
amounts of n-butane or propane are observed. Only little isobutane is consumed
in the initial phase, whereas the alkenes react immediately (42). In this case, the
alkenes ﬁrst oligomerize to form conjunct polymers. These polymers are also
called acid-soluble oil (ASO) or red oil, because they are found in the acid
phase and exhibit a dark red color. This oil is a complex mixture of highly
branched hydrocarbons with single and conjugated double bonds and rings
containing ﬁve and six carbon atoms. The individual compounds have
molecular weights in the range of 265–360 (43). They can abstract a hydride
from isobutane, forming a tertiary carbenium ion (8,44). When the reaction
is started with sulfuric acid that already contains some ASO, a better alkylate is
produced than with fresh acid (45), and the initiation period, which is
characterized by low yield and product quality, is markedly reduced (46).
The importance of the conjunct polymers is discussed below.
II.C. Alkene Addition and Isomerization
Once the tertiary cations have been formed, they can undergo electrophilic
addition to alkene molecules (Reaction (4)). The addition is exothermic and
contributes most of all the reaction steps to the overall heat of reaction. It has
been proposed (24) that instead of the alkenes, the corresponding esters are added
to the carbenium ions, restoring the acid in this way (Reaction (5)). The products
of both potential steps are the same.

ð5Þ
In the case of the butene isomers, the addition will lead to different isooctyl
cations, depending on the isomer and the type of carbenium ion. The reactions
involving s-butyl ions are likely to be negligible for liquid acid catalysts and of
minor importance for zeolites.
2-Butene as the feed alkene would thus—after hydride transfer—give 2,2,3-
TMP as the primary product. However, with nearly all the examined acids,
this isomer has been observed only in very small amounts. Usually the main
components of the TMP-fraction are 2,3,3-, 2,3,4-, and 2,2,4-TMP, with the
selectivity depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions. Consequently, a
fast isomerization of the primary TMP-cation has to occur. Isomerization through
hydride- and methyl-shifts is a facile reaction. Although the equilibrium
composition is not reached, long residence times favor these rearrangements
(47). The isomerization pathways for the TMP isomers are shown schematically
in Fig. 3.
Using 1-butene as the feed alkene in most cases does not lead to
dimethylhexanes as expected, but also to a mixture of TMPs. These are formed
in a rapid isomerization of the linear butenes, almost to equilibrium com-
positions, in which the 2-butenes are strongly favored. On the other hand, some
of the DMH-isomers produced in 2-butene alkylation also stem from a rapid
isomerization of the feed.
Not all acids are equally active isomerization catalysts. With zeolite H-BEA,
nearly identical selectivities are achieved when the feed is 1-butene instead of
2-butene (48). In general, even mildly acidic zeolites are excellent catalysts for
double-bond shift isomerization. Sulfuric acid also produces nearly identical
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
240
alkylates with 1- and 2-butene (45,49). Hydroﬂuoric acid, on the other hand, is
known to produce substantial amounts of DMHs from 1-butene (21,50).
Aluminum chloride also shows low rates of butene isomerization (18,51). It
seems unlikely that under mild alkylation conditions skeletal rearrangements,
which could isomerize TMP-cations into DMH-cations (and methylheptyl
cations), occur to a large extent. This type of isomerization has a much higher
true activation energy than hydride and methyl shifts.
Theoretically, even the direct alkylation of carbenium ions with isobutane is
feasible. The reaction of isobutane with a t-butyl cation would lead to 2,2,3,3-
tetramethylbutane as the primary product. With liquid superacids under
controlled conditions, this has been observed (52), but under typical alkylation
conditions 2,2,3,3-TMB is not produced. Kazansky et al. (26,27) proposed the
direct alkylation of isopentane with propene in a two-step alkylation process. In
this process, the alkene ﬁrst forms the ester, which in the second step reacts
with the isoalkane. Isopentane was found to add directly to the isopropyl ester
via intermediate formation of (non-classical) carbonium ions. In this way, the
carbenium ions are freed as the corresponding alkanes without hydride transfer
(see Section II.D). This conclusion was inferred from the virtual absence of
propane in the product mixture. Whether this reaction path is of signiﬁcance in
conventional alkylation processes is unclear at present. HF produces substantial
amounts of propane in isobutane/propene alkylation. The lack of 2,2,4-TMP in
the product, which is formed in almost all alkylates regardless of the feed (53),
implies that the mechanism in the two-step alkylation process is different from
that of conventional alkylation.

II.D. Hydride Transfer
Intermolecular hydride transfer (Reaction (6)), typically from isobutane to an
alkyl-carbenium ion, transforms the ions into the corresponding alkanes and
regenerates the t-butyl cation to continue the chain sequence in both liquid acids
and zeolites.
ð6Þ
Hydride transfer is the crucial step in the reaction sequence. It ensures the
perpetuation of the catalytic cycle and leads to the exclusive formation of
saturated compounds. In general, the hydride transfer between alkanes and alkyl
cations is the elementary step responsible for chain propagation of acid-catalyzed
transformations of hydrocarbons (54). Hydride transfer between tertiary carbon
atoms is much faster than that between secondary carbon atoms. Although
hydride transfers involving secondary alkyl cations take place in aluminum
halide systems (55), they are too slow to be observed in sulfuric acid (56). In
general, hydride transfer is accelerated by neighboring groups, which encourage
the stabilization of the resulting ion (57).
Investigations of hydride transfer in the gas phase (58–61) showed that the
reaction proceeds without a substantial activation energy. Its reaction rate was
found to exhibit two regimes, i.e., fast kinetics at low temperatures and slow
kinetics at high temperatures. This behavior was explained by a consecutive
mechanism proceeding through two reaction steps. It involved the formation of a
loose complex between the ion and the neutral alkane, which reacts to form a
tight complex having a bridging hydride between the two fragments. The rates of
different hydride transfer reactions between different carbenium ions and
different alkanes were found to depend on the reaction enthalpy and steric
factors involving van der Waals interactions between the approaching ion and
hydrogen and methyl groups on the adjacent carbon atom next to the tertiary
carbon atom. Steric hindrance in tertiary–tertiary hydride transfer reactions was
also established in the liquid phase employing superacidic catalysts (62). These
steric restrictions are presumably responsible for the low selectivity to the
primary product 2,2,3-TMP observed with all acids. Hydride- or methyl-shifts are
much more likely than hydride transfer to a difﬁcult-to-access carbon atom
bearing the positive charge. Note that the precursor carbenium ions of the most
abundant TMPs have their charge centers next to the chain end at a tertiary
carbon atom (Fig. 3).
There are substantial differences between gas-phase and liquid-phase hydride
transfer reactions. In the latter, the hydride transfer occurs with a low activation
energy of 13–17 kJ/mol, and no carbonium ions have been detected as
intermediates when secondary or tertiary carbenium ions were present (25).
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
242
These differences were explained by solvation effects in the liquid phase. The
carbenium ions are more efﬁciently stabilized by solvation than carbonium ions,
because the former have unsaturated trivalent carbon atoms. In this way, the
energy barrier between the (solvated) carbenium ion and the carbonium ion
transition state increases.
In zeolites, this barrier is even higher. As discussed in Section II.B, the lower
acid strength and the interaction between the zeolitic oxygen atoms and the
hydrocarbon fragments lead to the formation of alkoxides rather than carbenium
ions. Thus, extra energy is needed to transform these esters into carbonium ion-
like transition states. Quantum-chemical calculations of hydride transfer between
C2–C4 adsorbed alkenes and free alkanes on clusters representing zeolitic acid
sites led to activation energies of approximately 200 kJ/mol for isobutane/tert-
butoxide (29), 230–305 kJ/mol for propane/sec-propoxide, and 240 kJ/mol for
isobutane/tert-butoxide (32), 130–150 kJ/mol for ethane/ethene (63), 95–
105 kJ/mol for propane/propene, 88–109 kJ/mol for isobutane/isobutylene, and
110–118 kJ/mol for propane/isobutylene (64). In the last two references, the
carbonium ions were not found to be transition states but instead to be
energetically high-lying reaction intermediates. The authors claimed that these
carbonium ions exist as intermediates when the charge is delocalized and not
accessible to framework oxygen. The carbonium ions decompose directly into
the alkene and alkane, without forming alkoxides. Thus, the activation energies
are about a 100 kJ/mol lower than those calculated in the other mentioned
references, because covalent bonds do not have to be broken to reach the
transition state. Note that the activation energy is lowest in tertiary–tertiary
hydride transfer. In a study by Nowak et al. (65) activation energies for hydride
transfer between isobutane and tertiary and secondary acceptor cations were
compared with activation energies of isomerization steps between tertiary
carbenium ion species. The energy for tertiary–tertiary hydride transfer was
comparable to the energy of the isomerization, whereas the energy for tertiary–
secondary hydride transfer was almost twice as high.
Another study of ethane/ethene hydride transfer was performed to investigate
the inﬂuence of the Si/Al ratio and different levels of coverage of the acid sites
(66). The zeolite was modeled to represent the chabazite structure. It was found
that the electrostatic effects increase with decreasing Si/Al ratio, but they are
important only when the interaction between the zeolite and the adsorbed species
is clearly ionic. High coverage led to a destabilizing effect on the carbonium ions
due to repulsion between neighboring ions. The authors inferred that the
electrostatic forces are just one of many effects being of importance in zeolite-
catalyzed hydrocarbon reactions. Figure 4 summarizes the different calculated
potential energy proﬁles for the hydride transfer reaction in different media.
Experimental results characterizing hydride transfer in zeolites are scarce, as it
is a secondary reaction, which cannot be observed directly. Data from kinetics
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
243
measurements of cracking reactions of 2,2,4-TMP on USY zeolite gave values
for the apparent energies of activation of 47 kJ/mol lumped for all the hydride
transfer reactions that were occurring (67). A more detailed investigation of
isobutane cracking gave values of 64 kJ/mol for isobutane/propyl, 76 kJ/mol for
isobutane/n-butyl, and 62 kJ/mol for isobutane/isopentyl hydride transfer (40).
An earlier investigation by the same group led to higher values, namely, 81 kJ/
mol for isobutane/propyl, 67 kJ/mol for isobutane/n-butyl, and 125 kJ/mol for
isobutane/isopentyl hydride transfer (68). Even when average heats of adsorption
(ca. 40 kJ/mol) are added to the measured apparent energies to estimate the true
activation energies, these values are lower than the calculated values. Clearly, the
theoretical calculations overestimate the energy barrier. The overestimation is
speculated to be a consequence of incorrect modeling of the acid strength
(deprotonation energy, basicity of the lattice oxygen atoms) in the zeolitic cluster
used for the calculation.
It has been proposed that hydride transfer in zeolites requires the presence of
two adjacent Brønsted acid sites (69). In light of the above-mentioned theoretical
examinations and also adsorption isotherms of 1-butene and n-butane on USY
zeolites with various aluminum content (70), this proposition seems unlikely.
The reaction enthalpy of the hydride transfer step usually has a low absolute
value. Whether hydride transfer is exo- or endothermic depends on the stability
(evidenced by the heat of formation) of the involved carbenium ions. Branched
carbenium ions are more stable than linear ones. Longer carbenium ions are
more stable than shorter ones. Replacement of a long-chain carbenium ion by
Fig. 4. Potential energy proﬁles for the isobutane/t-butyl cation hydride transfer reaction in various

244
a short-chain alkane to give a short-chain ion is endothermic, as exempliﬁed by
the transfer of a hydride from isobutane to C8 carbenium ions.
With both liquid acid catalysts, but presumably to a higher degree with sulfuric
acid, hydrides are not transferred exclusively to the carbenium ions from
isobutane, but also from the conjunct polymers (44,46,71). Sulfuric acid
containing 4–6 wt% of conjunct polymers produces a much higher quality
alkylate than acids without ASOs (45). Cyclic and unsaturated compounds,
which are both present in conjunct polymers, are known to be hydride donors
(72). As was mentioned in Section II.B, these species can abstract a hydride from
isobutane to form the t-butyl cation, and they can give a hydride to a carbenium
ion, producing the corresponding alkane, for example the TMPs, as shown in
reactions (7) and (8).
ð7Þ
ð8Þ
In this way, the conjunct polymers serve as a reservoir of hydride ions. Under
some conditions, the polymers are a source of hydride ions, but they accept these
ions under other conditions. Substantial amounts of the saturated products are
supposedly formed via this route with sulfuric acid. In zeolites, species similar to
conjunct polymers also form. The heavy hydrocarbon molecules, which
deactivate the catalyst by pore blocking or by site blocking, are generally
termed “soft coke” or “low-temperature coke”, because of the absence of
aromatic species.
Only scant information is available about the inﬂuence of coke formation on
the alkylation mechanism. It has been proposed that, similar to the conjunct
polymers in liquid acids, heavy unsaturated molecules participate in hydride
transfer reactions. However, no direct evidence was given for this proposition
(69). In another study, the hydride transfer from unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons
was deduced from an initiation period in the activity of NaHY zeolites; complete
conversion of butene was achieved only after sufﬁcient formation of such
compounds (73).
In a series of investigations of the cracking of alkanes and alkenes on Y
zeolites (74,75), the effect of coke formation on the conversion was examined.
The coke that formed was found to exhibit considerable hydride transfer activity.
For some time, this activity can compensate for the deactivating effect of the
coke. On the basis of dimerization and cracking experiments with labeled 1-
butene on zeolite Y (76), it is known that substantial amounts of alkanes are
formed, which are saturated by hydride transfer from surface polymers. In both
liquid and solid acid catalysts, hydride transfer from isoalkanes larger than

245
isobutane may occur, especially from isopentane, which sometimes is used as
feedstock. However, no data are available providing information about the
signiﬁcance of hydride transfer reactions with higher hydrocarbons.
Hydride transfer from alkenes was also proposed to occur during sulfuric
acid-catalyzed alkylation modiﬁed with anthracene (77). Then the butene loses a
hydride and forms a cyclic carbocation intermediate, yielding—on reaction with
isobutene—trimethylpentyl cations. This conclusion was drawn from the obser-
vation of a sharp decrease in 2,2,3-TMP selectivity upon addition of anthracene
to the acid.
Fast hydride transfer reduces the lifetime of the isooctyl cations. The molecules
have less time to isomerize and, consequently, the observed product spectrum
should be closer to the primary products and further from equilibrium. This has
indeed been observed when adamantane, an efﬁcient hydride donor, was mixed
with zeolite H-BEA as the catalyst (78). When 2-butene/isobutane was used as
the feed, the increased hydride transfer activity led to considerably higher 2,2,3-
TMP and lower 2,2,4-TMP selectivities, as shown in Fig. 5.

BEA catalyst at 30 min TOS (P=O ¼ 10; OSV ¼ 0:2 h21, T ¼ 348 K) (78).

II.E. Oligomerization and Cracking
The overall product distribution is governed by the relative rates of alkene
addition and hydride transfer. With all acids, alkene addition is a much more
facile reaction than hydride transfer. With sulfuric acid, n-butene oligomerization
was found to be four times faster than hydride transfer (79). With zeolites, de
Jong et al. (80) reported oligomerization to be two orders of magnitude faster
than hydride transfer, whereas Simpson et al. (81) reported it to be three orders of
magnitude faster. With too low internal alkane/alkene ratios the alkenes will
oligomerize before they can be removed via hydride transfer. This is the key
problem in solid acid-catalyzed alkylation. A polymer will build up, which will
ﬁnally block the acid sites. With liquid acids, the conjunct polymers help in
maintaining a high hydride transfer activity. However, when the concentration
reaches a critical level, the acid strength will be too low for producing high-
quality alkylate. For this reason, in a continuous process, a stream of used acid
has to be constantly replaced by fresh acid to maintain the optimum level of acid
strength. The route to oligomerization products (sometimes also called multiple
alkylate) is depicted in Fig. 6. The rate constant kA deﬁnes the rate of alkene
addition, kB the hydride transfer rate, and kC the rate of deprotonation. The rate
ratio rB=ðrA þ rCÞ is the critical parameter that determines whether the catalyst
will effectively catalyze alkylation or deactivate quickly through multiple
alkylation/oligomerization reactions. High ratios can be achieved with low
alkene concentrations (as would be achieved in a backmixed reactor) and
maximized hydride transfer rates (a property of the catalyst).
Hydrocarbons with up to 16 carbon atoms are detected in a typical alkylate
(82). With the liquid acids, it was found that the oligomerization rate is higher for
isoalkenes than for linear alkenes (49). The same is true for solid acids (14,83).
Because of their tertiary carbon atoms, isobutylene and isopentene obviously
react more easily with carbenium ions. This point can be inferred from the reverse
reaction, b-scission (see below), which is fastest for reactions of tertiary cations
to give tertiary cations. In oligomerization experiments, the following pattern of
Fig. 6. Pathway to oligomerization products with the corresponding rate constants. Adapted from
Ref. (81).
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
247
reactivity of alkenes was found: isobutylene q n-butenes . propene . ethene.
This order can be readily explained by the relative stabilities of the carbenium
ions involved (84).
Not only are products with carbon numbers that are multiples of four are
formed, but so also are C5–C7 and C9, C10, and higher hydrocarbons. Cracking is
invariably associated with oligomerization. The heavy cations formed by
oligomerization have a tendency to fragment, forming C4–C16 cations and
alkenes, according to the b-scission rule, as depicted schematically in Reaction
(9) for a dodecyl cation cracking to give an isopentene and a heptyl cation.
ð9Þ
The isopentene produced will either be protonated or be added to another
carbenium ion. With a butyl cation, this would lead to a nonyl cation. The
resultant carbenium ion fragment can accept a hydride and form a product
heptane, or it can possibly add a butene to form a C11 cation. With hydride
transfer, another alkane with an odd number of carbon atoms is produced. Just
this example is sufﬁcient to show the huge variety of possible reactions. By
means of gas chromatographic analysis, Albright and Wood (82) found about
100–200 peaks in the C9–C16 region, regardless of the alkene and acid
employed. A similar number of products can be observed for solid acid-catalyzed
alkylation.
In general, oligomerization and cracking products exhibit lower octane
numbers than the TMPs. Average research octane number (RON) values of 92–
93 for C5–C7 and of 80–85 for C9–C16 have been reported (8). Parts of the
octane fraction also stem from oligomerization/cracking reactions. It is believed
that substantial amounts of the dimethylhexanes are produced via this route (79),
especially when isobutylene is the feed alkene (71). Isobutylene tends to
oligomerize quickly. Hence, it produces higher amounts of light and heavy ends
and cannot isomerize to 1-butene to produce DMHs in this way. Some of the
TMPs also will be produced through oligomerization/cracking pathways (20).
Concentrations of more than 20 wt% of TMPs in the C6þ fraction have been
observed in isopentane/2-pentene alkylation (53). The TMPs cannot be produced
via simple alkylation or self-alkylation with this feed. It has been proposed that
oligomerization/cracking constitutes the main route to alkylation products (16),
but this proposition fails to explain the usually high selectivity to the TMPs. To
form trimethylpentanes, some speciﬁc precursors would have to build up in high
concentrations, which is rather unlikely.
Hydrocracking experiments under ideal conditions provided kinetics informa-
tion characterizing the b-scission step. On the basis of this work, a classiﬁcation
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
248
of various types of b-scission has been introduced (85). Fragmentations starting
from a tertiary carbenium ion and giving a tertiary cation (type A) are very rapid.
Fragmentations involving secondary and tertiary ions (type B) are slower than
tertiary–tertiary b-scissions, but faster than secondary–secondary b-scissions
(type C). The slowest mode is the cracking of a secondary ion to give a primary
ion (type D). From the typical low reaction temperatures and the product
composition of a typical alkylate, which consists almost exclusively of branched
hydrocarbons, it can be concluded that only type A b-scissions occur at
signiﬁcant rates. Furthermore, protolytic cracking of alkanes via a carbonium ion
mechanism is highly unlikely under typical alkylation conditions. Hydrogen or
methane, which are characteristic products of such cracking, are not found in the
alkylate. At low temperatures, the cracking of alkanes is initiated by traces of
alkenes in the feed (also see Section II.B).
In general, oligomerization is an exothermic reaction (and therefore the
reverse, b-scission, is an endothermic reaction). Quantum-chemical calculations
of the b-scission step on a zeolite represented by a cluster model were performed
to estimate activation energies. For tertiary–secondary fragmentations, values
in the range of 234–284 kJ/mol and for secondary–secondary values in the range
of 288–314 kJ/mol (32) and 217–275 kJ/mol (86) were calculated. Here, the
activation energy of the reverse reaction was reported to be 71 kJ/mol less than
that of the forward reaction. Evaluation of alkane conversion experiments with
USY zeolite as catalyst, in general, provided much lower values than these (40,
67); average apparent activation energies for secondary–tertiary and secondary–
secondary b-scission steps were estimated to be approximately 115 kJ/mol. The
values for tertiary–tertiary b-scission given in the two references differed
between 66 and 102 kJ/mol. In an older study by the same authors (68), values for
b-scission and oligomerization were given; tertiary–tertiary b-scission was
characterized by an activation energy of 184 kJ/mol and the reverse reaction by a
value of 105 kJ/mol. Tertiary–secondary b-scission was found to be character-
ized by an activation energy of 84 kJ/mol and the reverse reaction by a value of
71 kJ/mol. The corresponding values for secondary–secondary b-scission were
found to be 130 and 33 kJ/mol. As for hydride transfer, the calculated values are
signiﬁcantly greater than the measured values (plus the heat of adsorption),
presumably as a consequence of an underestimation of the acid strength.
II.F. Self-Alkylation
With hydroﬂuoric acid (23,50), and to a lesser degree also with zeolites (14,81,
87–89), a signiﬁcant fraction of the product stems from self-alkylation, which is
sometimes also termed hydrogen transfer. The importance of this mechanism
depends on the acid, the alkene, and the reaction temperature. Self-alkylation
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
249
reactivity increases with molecular weight and the degree of branching of the
feed alkene (90). Generally, sulfuric acid is less active for self-alkylation than
hydroﬂuoric acid. Only when pentenes or higher alkenes are used is self-
alkylation signiﬁcant with sulfuric acid (49,91). In Fig. 7, the mechanism is
displayed for an exemplary isobutane/2-butene feed.
The crucial step in self-alkylation is decomposition of the butoxy group into a
free Brønsted acid site and isobutylene (proton transfer from the t-butyl cation to
the zeolite). Isobutylene will react with another t-butyl cation to form an isooctyl
cation. At the same time, a feed alkene repeats the initiation step to form a
secondary alkyl cation, which after accepting a hydride gives the t-butyl cation
and an n-alkane. The overall reaction with a linear alkene CnH2n as the feed is
summarized in reaction (10):
2i-C4H10 þ CnH2n ! i-C8H18 þ CnH2nþ2
ð10Þ
With propene, n-butene, and n-pentene, the alkanes formed are propane,
n-butane, and n-pentane (plus isopentane), respectively. The production of
considerable amounts of light n-alkanes is a disadvantage of this reaction route.
Furthermore, the yield of the desired alkylate is reduced relative to isobutane
and alkene consumption (8). For example, propene alkylation with HF can give
more than 15 vol% yield of propane (21). Aluminum chloride–ether complexes
also catalyze self-alkylation. However, when acidity is moderated with metal
chlorides, the self-alkylation activity is drastically reduced. Intuitively, the
formation of isobutylene via proton transfer from an isobutyl cation should be
more pronounced at a weaker acidity, but the opposite has been found (92). Other
properties besides acidity may contribute to the self-alkylation activity. Earlier
publications concerned with zeolites claimed this mechanism to be a source of
hydrogen for saturating cracking products or dimerization products (69,93).
However, as shown in reaction (10), only the feed alkene will be saturated, and
dehydrogenation does not take place.

II.G. Product and Acid Degradation
It has been found that C7–C9 isoalkanes react with strong acids to produce a
low-quality alkylate and conjunct polymers (94). In the presence of conjunct
polymers, highly branched isoalkanes might re-enter the reaction cycle by the
reverse of reaction (8). Oligomerization/cracking will then lead to inferior
products. This problem affects alkylation by both HF and H2SO4. It is unclear
whether this side reaction is of importance with zeolites under alkylation
conditions. On the zeolite H-FAU at temperatures as low as 373 K, 2,2,4-TMP
undergoes cracking into isobutane and isobutylene, with signiﬁcant coke
formation (95).
A problem that is characteristic of sulfuric acid-catalyzed alkylation is its
capability to oxidize hydrocarbons. H2SO4 decomposes in the presence of
isoalkanes to form water, SO2, and alkenes. This is a slow process, and so it
occurs predominantly when the acid is in contact with hydrocarbons for a longer
period. Higher temperatures favor the formation of SO2 (10). Some irreversible
reactions between acid and hydrocarbons also take place during alkylation.
Sulfone, sulfonic acid, and hydroxy groups have been detected in conjunct
polymers produced with H2SO4 as the catalyst (8,96). Kramer (97) reported that
2,3,4-TMP, after an induction period, is converted into a mixture of lower alkanes
(with a high fraction of isobutane) and isomerized octanes. The reaction was
initiated by the reduction of sulfuric acid to SO2 with the formation of carbenium
ions. In a subsequent paper by Kramer (98), more information about the reaction
of selected branched alkanes with sulfuric acid led to the conclusion that SO2 is
produced only during the initiation reaction. All subsequent reactions are
conventional carbenium ion type reactions. Alkanes with a higher degree of
branching show higher rates of degradation. Pure isobutane was found to react
with sulfuric acid at 298 K. The acid was slowly reduced to SO2, with isobutane
forming carbenium ions undergoing subsequent reactions. With traces of alkenes
in the feed, however, acid reduction was not observed (99).
II.H. Pathways to Allylic and Cyclic Compounds
The conjunct polymers formed during liquid-phase alkylation contain single and
conjugated double bonds and ﬁve- and six-rings. The residue on zeolitic catalysts
is highly branched, containing double bonds and conjugated double bonds and
possibly also ﬁve- and six-rings (73,88,100,101). The H/C ratio is about 1.8
(102), similar to that of conjunct polymers. In general, it is believed that at
temperatures below 473 K, coking of acidic catalysts mainly involves conden-
sation and rearrangement steps. Aromatic compounds are usually not formed
under such mild conditions (95). Extending these results to typical alkylation
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
251
reaction conditions, we expect that several alkene molecules will oligomerize and
crack or deprotonate to form a large and branched alkene. This alkene might
transfer a hydride to another carbenium ion and thus form an alkenyl carbenium
ion, which can desorb via proton transfer as a diene (Reaction (11)). Further
hydride transfer leads to a dienylic cation, which easily rearranges into an alkyl-
substituted ring (Reaction (12)) via a 1,5-cyclization and subsequent hydride and
methyl shifts.
ð11Þ
ð12Þ
The resultant cycloalkenyl carbenium ions, especially the cyclopentenyl
cations, are very stable (103,104) and can even be observed as free cations
in zeolites (105,106). These ions can oligomerize further and, within zeolites,
irreversibly block the acidic hydroxyl groups. With liquid acids, the oligomers
will dilute the acid and thus lower its acid strength.
II.I. Summary
Figure 8 summarizes the main reactions occurring during alkylation. Dimeriza-
tion and oligomerization reactions are more important with zeolitic catalysts on
acidic sites with lower acid strengths (Section III.B.2) or with severely diluted
liquid acids (Section III.A). Hydride transfer from conjunct polymers is more
important with sulfuric acid, and self-alkylation activity is more signiﬁcant with
hydroﬂuoric acid. Repeatedly going through the alkylation cycle without hydride
transfer (multiple alkylation) and through the dimerization cycle without proton
transfer (oligomerization) leads to the formation of heavy compounds, which will
react further via cracking, hydride or proton transfer, and cyclization. As long as
the catalyst shows sufﬁcient hydride transfer activity, all alkenes will react, and
only saturated products will leave the reaction cycles.
III. Physical–Chemical Phenomena Inﬂuencing the Reaction
As was pointed out, the chemistry of the alkylation reaction can be explained by a
set of mechanistic steps that are similar and in some cases the same for all
the different acids examined. However, the importance of each step varies with

252
the catalyst and reaction conditions. The understanding of these parameters is
thus of utmost importance. This is especially true for the solid acid catalysts.
They can be synthesized and modiﬁed in a nearly inﬁnite number of ways to
inﬂuence in a complex and subtle manner the alkylation performance. In Section
III.A, the chemical and physical properties of the individual alkylation catalysts
and how they affect the mechanism are reviewed, and concomitantly the
inﬂuence of process parameters, such as temperature, alkane/alkene ratio, and
residence time on the reaction is assessed.
III.A. Properties of Liquid Acid Alkylation Catalysts
In the liquid acid-catalyzed processes, the hydrocarbon phase and the acid phase
are only slightly soluble in each other; in the two-phase stirred reactor, the
hydrocarbon phase is dispersed as droplets in the continuous acid phase. The
reaction takes place at or close to the interface between the hydrocarbon and
the acid phase. The overall reaction rate depends on the area of the interface.
Larger interfacial areas promote more rapid alkylation reactions and generally
result in higher quality products. The alkene is transported through the
hydrocarbon phase to the interface, and, upon contact with the acid, forms an
acid-soluble ester, which slowly decomposes in the acid phase to give a solvated

carbenium ion or the alkene. Isobutane can react at the interface or be transported
into the acid phase and react there. The most important parameters determining
the ease of formation of a large reaction zone are the viscosity and the solubility
of hydrocarbons in the acid. These properties differ substantially for sulfuric and
hydroﬂuoric acid.
Under typical alkylation conditions, the viscosity of sulfuric acid is two orders
of magnitude higher than that of hydroﬂuoric acid, and the solubility of isobutane
is approximately 30 times lower. The relatively high solubility of isobutane in
HF, together with a high interfacial area, ensures high isobutane/alkene ratios
in the acid and, thus, high hydride transfer rates and relatively low selectivity
for the formation of undesired products from oligomerization/cracking and
isomerization and for the formation of conjunct polymers. Consequently, sulfuric
acid/hydrocarbon phases have to be mixed much more vigorously than hydro-
ﬂuoric acid/hydrocarbon phases to obtain a high-quality alkylate. For the same
reason, hydroﬂuoric acid-catalyzed processes can operate at lower residence
times and higher temperatures than sulfuric acid-catalyzed processes. Using
sulfuric acid with isobutane/2-butene in a laboratory reactor, Li et al. (107) found
that increasing the agitator speed from 1000 to 3000 rpm increased the product
RON from 86 to 94. Albright (11) discerned a minimum of four types of droplets
in acid/hydrocarbon dispersions. The droplets differ in size and in the concen-
trations of reactants and products. The formation (and the separation) of acid/
hydrocarbon emulsions depends on the temperature, the composition of the acid,
and the acid/hydrocarbon ratio (108).
Sulfuric acid is a somewhat stronger acid than hydroﬂuoric acid. The values of
the Hammett acidity function H0 for the water-free acids are 214.1 for H2SO4
and 212.1 for HF. It is, however, interesting to note that the maximum alkylate
quality obtained with sulfuric acid is not achieved with the highest acidity, but
with acid containing 1–1.5 wt% water and 4–5 wt% ASOs (96). Water reduces
the acidity to a greater extent than hydrocarbon diluents. Besides their hydride
transfer capabilities, the ASOs act as surfactants, increasing the interfacial area.
When the concentration of diluents exceeds a certain level, the acid strength
is too low to produce a high-quality alkylate. Sulfuric acid of 60–80 wt%
concentration catalyzes only alkene oligomerization. The acid strength is too low
for catalysis of the more demanding reactions hydride transfer and b-scission
(27). A relatively sharp transition between oligomerization and alkylation
activity has been measured with sulfuric acid at H0 values between 28.0 and
28.5 (109). If such low-acidity values occur in an alkylation reactor, oligomer-
ization reactions become so predominant that the acid strength cannot be
maintained and the plant is said to be in an acid runaway condition.
The same principles regarding the acidity can be applied to hydroﬂuoric acid-
catalyzed alkylation, which is more sensitive towards water, so that the feed must
be thoroughly dried before entering the reactor. Furthermore, the acid dilution by
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
254
hydrocarbons is greater as a consequence of their higher solubility in HF (15).
Employing triﬂic acid modiﬁed with water or triﬂuoroacetic acid, Olah et al.
(110) found the best alkylation conditions at an acid strength of about H0 ¼
210:7 for both systems. Pure triﬂic acid (with H0 ¼ 214:1) produced mainly
cracked compounds. Diluted triﬂic acid with H0 . 210:7 favored oligomeriza-
tion. The same research group tested different liquid acids diluted with liquid
carbon dioxide. Although very strong acids such as triﬂic acid produce higher
quality alkylate upon dilution with CO2, sulfuric acid (being less strongly acidic
than triﬂic acid) performed better without CO2 (111). The different H0 values
observed for the transition from alkylation to oligomerization with sulfuric and
triﬂic acid suggest that the acid strength is not the only factor determining the
reactivity of the carbenium ions.
III.B. Properties of Zeolitic Alkylation Catalysts
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used as solid acid catalysts or catalyst
components in areas ranging from petroleum reﬁning to the synthesis of
intermediates and ﬁne chemicals (112,113). An important reason for their
widespread use is the ﬂexibility they offer regarding the tailoring of the
concentration and nature of catalytically active sites and their immediate
environments. We note that discrimination between chemical and structural
aspects works well at a conceptual level, but one faces quite severe limitations as
soon as one tries to separate the contributions of the two effects. The complexity
arises because the chemical properties of a particular molecular sieve are
connected with its framework density.
III.B.1. Adsorption and Diffusion of Hydrocarbons
One of the major characteristics of acidic zeolites that sets them apart from
the liquid acids is their selective and strong chemisorption of unsaturated
compounds. Because of the high polarity of the zeolitic surface, especially in
aluminum-rich zeolites, polar molecules will be preferentially adsorbed. This
property is clearly demonstrated by the high water uptake capacity of zeolite X,
which exceeds 25 wt%. Furthermore, the electrostatic ﬁeld in the zeolite pores
enhances the adsorption of polarizable molecules (114). Thus, although the
concentration of alkenes in the liquid phase might be low, they will preferentially
adsorb in the zeolite pores, so that in the pore system the alkene concentration
will be considerably higher resulting in much higher relative rates of oligo-
merization vs. hydride transfer, as was discussed in Section II.E. This selective
adsorption is the major reason why zeolites deactivate rapidly if no special
measures are taken to minimize the alkene concentration close to the acidic sites.
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
255
Nevertheless, the adsorption of alkenes can differ substantially from one zeolite
to another, even for one type of zeolite, depending on the concentration of
framework aluminum and the modiﬁcation procedure (70).
Also typical for molecular sieves is the increasing heat of adsorption of
hydrocarbons with increasing chain length (115). Each carbon atom contributes
equally to the total heat of adsorption. This value depends on the zeolite pore size
and shape, so that different adsorption enthalpies are measured for different
zeolites. Increasing framework density (number of T-atoms per unit volume,
where T refers to Si or Al) leads to increased heats of adsorption (116,117).
Protons add another constant value (which depends on the chemical composition)
to the overall heat of adsorption, as represented in Fig. 9A and B. This
phenomenon is responsible for different apparent activation energies for a given
reaction type found with hydrocarbons of different chain lengths. The actual
intrinsic activation energies (as well as the corresponding pre-exponential
factors) are nearly independent of chain length (118). Assuming the relationship
between chain length and adsorption enthalpy to be linear over a wide range,
relative desorption rates for various hydrocarbons can be calculated for a given
temperature. Thus, using the data for H-FAU and a temperature of 348 K,
the desorption of a C12 molecule is four orders of magnitude slower than that of
an C8 molecule, and that of a C16 is eight orders of magnitude slower and that of
a C20 12 orders of magnitude slower (Fig. 9C). These huge differences give one
a sense of the difﬁculties of removing heavy products from the zeolite surface
using purely adsorption/desorption arguments. Once such a heavy molecule has
formed, it is unlikely to desorb.
III.B.2. Brønsted Acid Sites
Zeolites exhibit a considerably lower proton (acid site) concentration than liquid
acids. For example, 1 g of H2SO4 contains 20 £ 1023 moles of protons, whereas
1 g of zeolite HY, with a Si/Al atomic ratio of ﬁve, contain no more than 3 £ 1023
moles of protons. (Note that this is a crude approximation of the acidic sites
available for catalysis, because it assumes that with both materials all protons are
available and catalytically active.) Moreover, 1 g of H2SO4 occupies far less
volume (i.e., 0.5 cm3) than the equivalent mass of zeolite (4–6 cm3).
In contrast to liquid acids, zeolites encompass different populations of sites that
differ substantially in their nature and strength. Liquid acids with a given
composition have a well-deﬁned acid strength. This is not the case for zeolites.
Depending on the type of zeolite, its aluminum content, and the exchange
procedure used in its preparation, Brønsted and Lewis acid sites with a wide
range of strengths and concentrations are present. To summarize the effects of all
parameters inﬂuencing the acidity of zeolites is beyond the scope of this review.

The different reaction steps in alkylation require different minimum acid
strengths to be effectively catalyzed. Double bond isomerization is catalyzed
even by weak acid sites. Even a fully deactivated zeolite retains some activity for
isomerization of butenes (119,120). Dimerization/oligomerization also does not
require strong acidity, as was concluded from a study of a series of USY zeolites
with different unit cell sizes. Correlations between the acidity and the alkylation
performance revealed that the acid strength required for performing the different
reactions occurring during alkylation decreases in the order cracking .
alkylation (addition of butene to a tertiary butyl) . dimerization (addition of a
butene to a secondary butyl) (121). A comparison between the iso-structural H-
SAPO-37 and H-FAU as alkylation catalysts showed that the H-FAU has a much
higher relative concentration of strong acid sites than the H-SAPO-37. Therefore,
the H-SAPO-37 mainly catalyzed dimerization, with a small amount of 3,4-DMH
as the most abundant saturated compound, whereas the H-FAU produced mainly
TMPs (122).
The lifetime of a zeolitic alkylation catalyst depends on the concentration of
Brønsted acid sites. This has been shown by Nivarthy et al. (78), who used a
series of zeolites H-BEA with varied concentrations of back-exchanged sodium
ions. The sodium decreased the concentration of Brønsted acid centers, which led
to a concomitant decrease in the measured catalyst lifetime during alkylation.
However, there are contrasting opinions about the acid strength required for
optimum alkylation performance with zeolites. Hydride transfer is the step that
determines the product quality and the catalyst lifetime. Thus, it is crucial to
know which conditions favor a high hydride transfer rate. From the above-
presented investigations, it can be concluded that stronger sites are necessary to
effectively catalyze hydride transfer. Sto
¨cker et al. (123) synthesized and tested
EMT and FAU samples with enhanced Si/Al ratios of 3.5 (made by use of crown
ethers as templates). They explained the better performance of H-EMT relative to
that of H-FAU by its higher ratio of strong-to-weak Brønsted acid sites.
Dealumination of the H-FAU led to better results because of additional small
numbers of very strong acid sites. No direct demonstration was given to support
this opinion (124). La-exchange of H-EMT led to a slightly better performance
than that of H-EMT. This improvement was also attributed to a higher ratio of
strong-to-weak Brønsted acid sites (125). A similar conclusion was derived by
Corma et al. (126), who compared USY, MOR, BEA, ZSM-5, and MCM-22. The
relative decrease of activity for the formation of TMPs with time on stream was
observed to depend on the concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites in the fresh
zeolite. Diaz-Mendoza et al. (127) studied commercial REY, USY, and BEA
samples. In contrast to the aforementioned groups, they found Brønsted acid sites
with intermediate strengths to be the appropriate sites for maintaining good
alkylation performance.
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
258
It is well established that with time on stream the sites strong enough for
catalyzing hydride transfer deactivate ﬁrst. In the ﬁrst phase of operation and
deactivation, the catalyst produces a mixture of saturated isoalkanes, usually with
(nearly) complete butene conversion, and in the second phase, alkenes, mainly
octenes, are produced at a substantially lower butene conversion. The product in
this second phase resembles the product observed with the weakly acidic H-
SAPO-37. The mixture of butene isomers found in the product stream in the
second phase is close to the equilibrium composition. A typical example is
depicted in Fig. 10. Several investigations of zeolite- and other solid acid-
catalyzed alkylation obviously have been performed in the oligomerization
regime (129–134). As a consequence of insufﬁcient acidity or an inappropriate
choice of reaction conditions, the catalysts examined in these investigations
produced mainly oligomerization products and only small amounts of true
alkylate. Unequivocal conclusions can be drawn neither about the alkylation
mechanism nor on the true alkylation activity of the tested materials under these
circumstances.
The characterization method employed in nearly all the above-mentioned
investigations for measuring the strength of acid sites was pyridine adsorption/
desorption monitored by IR spectroscopy. Pyridine forms the pyridinium ion
on Brønsted acid sites and binds to Lewis acid sites by forming coordination
complexes. Heating the sample with the adsorbed pyridine gives characteristic
desorption curves for pyridine bound to Brønsted or Lewis acid centers. From
such data, Brønsted acid/Lewis acid site ratios at a given temperature and
“strong” to “weak” acid site ratios can be calculated and correlated with
Fig. 10. Typical time on stream behavior of a CeY zeolite alkylated in a ﬁxed-bed reactor (128).

259
the catalytic performance. Strong and weak acid sites here are deﬁned by the
amount of pyridine that remains adsorbed at a certain temperature—the higher
the temperature, the stronger the bonding and the stronger the acid site. These
temperatures are chosen in a rather arbitrary manner, the upper limit of which is
typically restricted by the IR cell and the zeolite itself (673–823 K). The strong
acid sites are not of uniform strength, likely exhibiting a broad distribution, up to
a minute amount of “very strong” acid sites, which are difﬁcult to detect because
of their low concentrations. Whether such very strong acid sites are responsible
for an enhanced alkylation activity is not yet determined.
III.B.3. Lewis Acid Sites and Extra-Framework Aluminum
Lewis acid sites in zeolites originate from a partial destruction of the framework.
During the modiﬁcation procedure, which is necessary to transform the parent
material into its acidic form, part of the aluminum present in the framework is
removed from its positions in the crystalline framework (usually during
calcination in a water-containing atmosphere, i.e., high-temperature hydrolysis
of Si–O–Al bonds) to give extra-framework aluminum species (EFAL). Some of
the species formed in this way exhibit Lewis acidity. Another source of Lewis
acid sites is metal ions in cation-exchange positions. However, most of these
metals exhibit weaker Lewis acidity than aluminum species. Lewis acid sites do
not catalyze the alkylation reaction, but their presence undoubtedly inﬂuences the
performance of zeolitic catalysts in alkylation. It has been claimed that the
presence of strong Lewis acid sites promotes the formation of unsaturated
compounds (127). The favored production of unsaturated carbenium ions with
increased Lewis acidity was also evidenced by Flego et al. (100) investigating the
deactivation of a La–H-FAU zeolite in isobutane/1-butene alkylation. Increasing
the catalyst activation temperature led to higher Lewis acid site concentrations,
which increased the formation of mono- and di-enylic carbenium ions. Besides
the ability to increase the rate of formation of unsaturated compounds, Lewis acid
sites have been claimed to increase the alkane/alkene ratio close to the Brønsted
acid sites, through the adsorption/desorption equilibrium of the alkenes on the
Lewis acid sites. The increased alkene concentration accelerates oligomerization
and leads to premature catalyst deactivation (78). EFAL species also inﬂuence
the acidity of neighboring Brønsted acid sites. Corma et al. (135) examined
zeolite H-BEA, which they had exposed to several post-synthesis treatments to
change the framework and extra-framework composition. On the basis of the
combined reaction and characterization data, the authors concluded that some
cationic EFAL species compensate the framework charge, and other condensed
EFAL species block a fraction of the Brønsted acid sites, thus lowering their
concentration. On the other hand, these authors suggested a synergistic effect of
dispersed cationic EFAL species and framework hydroxyls to form Brønsted acid
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
260
sites of enhanced strength. A further study by the same group (136) showed that
in samples with a high framework aluminum concentration, the removal of EFAL
was detrimental to the catalytic performance, whereas in the samples with low
framework aluminum content the catalytic activity increased as a result of the
removal of EFAL. The fact that mild steaming enhances the strength of Brønsted
acid sites is known from other hydrocarbon reactions, such as cracking and
isomerization of alkanes and disproportionation of toluene. Selective poisoning
of Brønsted acid sites with cesium has shown that only a minute amount of very
strong sites is present in mildly steamed samples. However, these sites are
responsible for a drastic increase in activity (118). Residual sodium also exhibits
a poisoning effect on very strong Brønsted acid sites. Small amounts of sodium
were found to eliminate highly acidic centers created by the interaction of EFAL
with protonic sites (137).
III.B.4. Silicon/Aluminum Ratio
The inﬂuence of the Si/Al ratio on the catalytic performance is discussed
primarily in terms of effects of changes in the concentration and acid strength of
the protonic sites. The electrostatic forces induced by the presence of framework
aluminum are often neglected. With increasing aluminum concentration in the
framework (i.e., with lower Si/Al ratio), the total concentration of protonic acid
sites increases. On the other hand, it is believed that the strengths of the acid sites
decrease with increasing aluminum concentration. At high aluminum concen-
trations the thermal stability of the zeolites in their protonic forms is also reduced,
facilitating the formation of extra-framework species (138). Examining a series
of ultrastable Y zeolites, Corma et al. (121) found the catalyst with the lowest Si/
Al ratio to be best in time-on-stream behavior and TMP selectivity. With a
decreasing Si/Al ratio, the ratio of stronger to weaker acid sites increased and was
correlated with the alkylation/oligomerization selectivity ratio measured with the
samples. The same trend was found by de Jong et al. (80), who also tested a series
of ultrastable Y zeolites in a semi-batch reactor. These authors also tested a
zeolite BEA with a Si/Al ratio of 15 that performed better than the Y zeolites.
They postulated that a decrease of the Si/Al ratio in BEA also should lead to a
superior catalyst associated with a higher Brønsted acid site concentration.
Weitkamp and Traa (139) also accentuated this hypothesis.
Some investigations have focused on the inﬂuence of the Si/Al ratio in zeolite
BEA. Corma et al. (140) used various BEA samples synthesized with different
Si/Al ratios and found a higher thermal stability towards dealumination with
increasing Si/Al ratio. The most stable catalyst was also the most active one.
Weitkamp et al. (141) compared the selectivities of four H-BEA samples with
Si/Al ratios ranging from 12 to 90. The octane number selectivities ran through
a maximum at a Si/Al ratio of 19, whereas the TMP/DMH ratio decreased
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
261
continuously with the Si/Al ratio. Loenders et al. (142) tested BEA samples
with framework Si/Al ratios ranging from 13 to 77, reporting that the individual
acid sites perform an identical number of catalytic turnovers before
deactivation, independent of the acid site density. They claimed that the only
way to enhance the activity and stability of zeolite BEA for isobutane alkylation
is to increase the aluminum content of BEA nanoparticles. The only reported
investigation of zeolite BEA with a Si/Al ratio lower than nine was performed
by Yoo and Smirniotis (143), utilizing H-BEA synthesized with Si/Al ratios
between 6 and 30. In contrast to what was postulated earlier, the zeolites
exhibited a maximum in the catalytic lifetime when the Si/Al ratio was between
8.5 and 15. The hydrogen transfer activities measured separately with n-hexane
as the reactant were comparable for all the samples up to a Si/Al ratio of 15.
The authors concluded that the BEA with the highest aluminum content
performed worse than the other samples with the same hydride transfer activity
as a consequence of the lower crystallinity and micropore volume, which were
inherent to the synthesis procedure for aluminum-rich zeolite BEA. In a patent
assigned to Mobil Oil (144), three BEA samples, with Si/Al ratios of 7.3, 16.0,
and 18.5, were compared. The only detail given about the alkylation perfor-
mance was the TMP/(C8-TMP) ratio, which was observed to increase with
decreasing Si/Al ratio, which is suggestive of the superiority of the material
with the low Si/Al ratio.
Notwithstanding some obviously contradictory results in the literature, the data
summarized above can be summarized as follows: the general trend is that high
aluminum contents are beneﬁcial for the alkylation performance. This inference
is supported by results from cracking experiments with zeolites having various
Si/Al ratios. The bimolecular hydride transfer step is favored in materials with
low Si/Al ratios (54,145,146). Thus, zeolites with low Si/Al ratios should exhibit
better time-on-stream behavior than those with high Si/Al ratios.
Zeolite X is the large-pore zeolite with the highest aluminum content
possible. The ﬁrst investigations of zeolite-catalyzed alkylation were done on
this material (13,147). Weitkamp, comparing highly cerium-exchanged Y and
X zeolites, found the CeX zeolite to exhibit twice the lifetime of CeY zeolite as
a consequence of the higher concentration of acid sites (148). In light of these
ﬁndings, it is surprising that only a small number of investigations have been
devoted to this material. As the purely protonic form of zeolite X is unstable,
polyvalent metal ions have to be introduced to induce acidity (Section III.B.5).
A variety of di- and tri-valent metals have been examined, with and without
additional ammonium exchange (149–151). Rare earth elements, especially
lanthanum, obviously are best suited to the goal, producing highly acidic and
thermally stable catalysts. LaCaX zeolite has also been proposed as an
excellent isobutane/ethene alkylation catalyst (152,153). Falsely, the authors
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
262
attributed the excellent performance to superacidic centers with a narrow
acidity distribution.
III.B.5. Metal Ions in Ion-Exchange Positions
Rare earth exchanged faujasites (REHY and REUSY) are widely used in the
FCC process (138). Aqueous ion exchange with rare earth salts in faujasites
leads to removal of ions in the supercage only, because a bulky hydration
sphere around the ions is larger than the six-membered ring of the sodalite cage,
so that the ions do not enter these cages. Calcination removes the waters of
hydration, and the naked cation is able to move into the sodalite cage, forming
cationic polynuclear hydroxy complexes (154–156). These species impart
thermal and hydrothermal stability to the material. Rare earth exchanged
zeolites exhibit considerable Brønsted acidity resulting from hydrolysis of the
hydrated rare earth ions (157,158). This principle works with most polyvalent
metals, and the rare earth elements induce the highest acidity and best stability
(159–161).
Besides zeolite X (discussed in Section III.B.4), zeolite Y is the one that has
been the subject of most investigations of cation exchange. Researchers at Sun
Oil Company extensively explored rare earth exchanged Y zeolites (14). On the
basis of their work described in patents (151,162–166), it can be concluded that
partially rare earth exchanged faujasites are more active catalysts than the purely
protonic forms. The importance of quantitative removal of sodium from zeolite
was demonstrated. Chu and Chester (119,120) compared variously modiﬁed Y
zeolites; REHY zeolite (RE is rare earth) gave the highest yield and the best
product quality. Dealumination of REHY zeolite did not improve its
performance. USY and REUSY zeolites were both characterized by low
conversion and yield, and there were not signiﬁcant differences between the two.
In their work on EMT and FAU zeolites, the SINTEF group (125,167) compared
H- and La-exchanged samples and showed that a partially La-exchanged catalyst
is superior to both fully La-exchanged and pure H-form samples. H-EMT
contains the highest total number of Brønsted acid sites as measured with
pyridine adsorbed at 423 K. The partially La-exchanged sample (51%
exchanged) has twice as high a concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites (as
measured by the pyridine retained at 823 K) as the pure H-EMT and also a lower
concentration of Lewis acid sites. The increase in acid strength has been
rationalized by a withdrawal of electrons from the Lewis-base framework oxygen
atoms through polyvalent lanthanum cations in the sodalite cages. This electron
withdrawal effect is supposed to be similar to the action of EFAL species
in steamed zeolites. The abstraction of electrons weakens the O–H bond and
thus increases the proton-donor strength of the OH group (156). In a patent
assigned to Mobil Oil (168), rare earths exchanged into zeolite ZSM-20
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
263
(intergrowth between FAU and EMT) are claimed to improve conversion and
selectivities to TMPs. REZSM-20 was also claimed to perform better than
REHY. In another Mobil patent (169), REY and REUSY zeolites were compared;
the REY zeolite exhibited a slightly higher alkylate quality, whereas the REUSY
zeolite gave a slightly higher conversion. The subtle differences in the reports are,
however, difﬁcult to evaluate as detailed characterizations of the materials are
lacking most of the time. In light of the strong inﬂuence of the concentration of
Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, a judgment about which of the materials has the
best properties is not possible.
III.B.6. Structure Types of Zeolites
Only large-pore zeolites exhibit sufﬁcient activity and selectivity for the
alkylation reaction. Chu and Chester (119) found ZSM-5, a typical medium-pore
zeolite, to be inactive under typical alkylation conditions. This observation was
explained by diffusion limitations in the pores. Corma et al. (126) tested HZSM-5
and HMCM-22 samples at 323 K, ﬁnding that the ZSM-5 exhibited a very low
activity with a rapid and complete deactivation and produced mainly dimethyl-
hexanes and dimethylhexenes. The authors claimed that alkylation takes place
mainly at the external surface of the zeolite, whereas dimerization, which is less
sterically demanding, proceeds within the pore system. Weitkamp and Jacobs
(170) found ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 to be active at temperatures above 423 K. The
product distribution was very different from that of a typical alkylate; it contained
much more cracked products; trimethylpentanes were absent; and considerable
amounts of monomethyl isomers, n-alkanes, and cyclic hydrocarbons were
present. This behavior was explained by steric restrictions that prevented the
formation of highly branched carbenium ions. Reactions with the less branched
or non-branched carbenium ions require higher activation energies, so that higher
temperatures are necessary.
MCM-22, with a larger pore volume than ZSM-5, revealed behavior inter-
mediate between what was observed for large- and medium-pore zeolites (126).
Unverricht et al. (141) also examined MCM-22; at 353 and 393 K, it was found to
produce mainly cracked products and dimethylhexanes and to deactivate rapidly.
MCM-36 gained considerable interest that is evidenced by the patent literature
(171–174). MCM-36 is a pillared zeolite based on the structure of MCM-22.
Ideally, it should contain mesopores between layers of MCM-22 crystallites. This
structure was found to be much more active and stable than MCM-22 (175).
Alkane cracking experiments with zeolites having various pore dimensions
evidenced the preference of monomolecular over sterically more demanding
bimolecular pathways, such as hydride transfer, in small- and medium-pore
zeolites (146).

In contrast to the product distributions observed for medium-pore zeolites, the
product distributions observed for large-pore zeolites resemble those of typical
alkylates. However, within the distribution, signiﬁcant differences are observed.
It is difﬁcult to separate the inﬂuence on the alkylation reaction of the structure
from the inﬂuences of other properties, mainly the acid site strength and
concentration. Undisputable results may be achieved only if all but one
parameters are held constant. Yoo et al. (176) compared USY, BEA, MOR, LTL,
and ZSM-12 zeolites with Si/Al ratios between 20 and 34 (achieved either by
direct synthesis or by various leaching techniques) and acid site densities
between 0.4 and 0.7 mmol/g. These structure types were chosen because they
represent three-, two-, and one-dimensional zeolites. The authors claimed that the
inﬂuence of most properties inﬂuencing the performance—besides the
structure—was minimized. Zeolite BEA exhibited the best time-on-stream
behavior with respect to lifetime and TMP selectivity. ZSM-12 also showed a
long lifetime, but it catalyzed oligomerization instead of alkylation. USY, MOR,
and LTL were found to deactivate quickly, with LTL retaining a surprisingly
stable TMP selectivity at low conversions. No heavy coke molecules were found
in zeolites BEA and ZSM-12. The authors concluded that zeolites without
periodic expansions (i.e., without larger voids that connect channels) do not allow
extensive coke formation and hence deactivate relatively slowly. Unfortunately,
no details about the concentrations and strengths of the acid sites in the samples
were given. The ﬁnding that zeolite BEA does not produce signiﬁcant amounts of
coke is at variance with results of other research groups. For example, Nivarthy
et al. (48) calculated values of about 14 wt% of deposit formed on H-BEA
zeolites. In the aforementioned investigation by Corma et al. (126), USY, BEA,
and MOR were compared with ZSM-5 and MCM-22. The three large-pore
zeolites exhibited similar C8-selectivities but different behavior with time on
stream. The differences were attributed to differences in the acidities of the
samples. In a comparative investigation of the acidity of zeolites with low Si/Al
ratios (zeolites BEA, ZSM-20, Y, and dealuminated USY), the acid strength
was found to decrease in the following order: H-BEA . H-USY . H-ZSM-20 .
H-Y (177).
In another article by Corma et al. (178), ITQ-7, a three-dimensional large-pore
zeolite, was tested as an alkylation catalyst and compared with a BEA sample
of comparable Si/Al ratio and crystal size. The ratio of the selectivities to 2,2,4-
TMP and 2,2,3-TMP, which have the largest kinetic diameter of the TMPs, and
2,3,3-TMP and 2,3,4-TMP, which have the lowest kinetic diameter, was used as a
measure of the inﬂuence of the pore structure. Lower (2,2,4-TMP þ 2,2,3-TMP)/
(2,3,3-TMP þ 2,3,4-TMP) ratios in ITQ-7 were attributed to its smaller pore
diameter. The bulky isomers have more spacious transition states, so that their
formation in narrow pores is hindered; moreover, their diffusion is slower. The
hydride transfer activity, estimated by the dimethylhexane/dimethylhexene ratio,
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
265
was found to be lower in ITQ-7 than in H-BEA. This observation was also
explained by the smaller pore diameter, because the acidities of the two different
zeolites were found to be similar. Nivarthy et al. (179) compared the three large-
pore zeolites H-BEA, H-FAU, and H-EMT; the lifetimes of the zeolites were
found to depend on the Brønsted acid site concentration. H-BEA, with the lowest
Brønsted acid site concentration, was characterized by the shortest lifetime and
H-EMT, with the highest concentration, the longest lifetime. Signiﬁcant
differences were observed in the TMP distribution. H-BEA exhibited a very
high 2,2,4-TMP selectivity, which was attributed to a lower rate of hydride
transfer vs. isomerization of the precursor carbenium ions. An exceptionally high
2,2,4-TMP selectivity is characteristic of zeolite BEA. Although with most other
zeolites the selectivities vary depending on the conditions employed, BEA
always produces high yields of 2,2,4-TMP.
The research group at SINTEF (123,124,180) dedicated a series of papers
to the examination of FAU and EMT zeolites, comparing them in their H-
and La-exchanged form with and without dealumination. EMT was always
superior to FAU. The alkylate yield, expressed as mass of alkylate produced
divided by the catalyst mass, was higher for the EMT samples. EMT also
produced a greater amount of trimethylpentanes than the FAU samples. The
differences between the two materials were discussed in terms of the slightly
larger supercage in EMT, which is claimed to reduce the steric constraints on
the bulky transition states for hydride transfer, and in terms of acidity, with
EMT samples exhibiting a higher concentration of Brønsted acid sites
retaining pyridine at high temperatures. A comparison of La-EMT, La-FAU,
and La-BEA revealed that the La-BEA performed worse than the two other
materials, both in terms of alkylate yield and selectivity (167), but the lack of
information about the acidity of the samples prevents a detailed evaluation of
this report.
Recently, mesoporous aluminosilicates with
strong acidity and high
hydrothermal stability have been synthesized via self-assembly of alumino-
silicate nanoclusters with templating micelles. The materials were found to
contain both micro- and mesopores, and the pore walls consist of primary
and secondary building units, which might be responsible for the acidity and
stability (181). These materials were tested in isobutane/n-butene alkylation
at 298 K, showing a similar time-on-stream behavior to that of zeolite BEA.
No details of the product distribution were given.
The patent literature discloses alkylation performances of several additional
structure types. A Mobil patent (182) describes the use of VTM-A, a pillared
titanosilicate of the MCM-27 family. The catalyst produced about 80 wt% of
octanes under relatively mild conditions (OSV ¼ 0:05 h21, P=O ratio ¼ 20).
A number of patents describe the use of MCM-36. MCM-49, which is closely
related to MCM-22, has also been tested as an alkylation catalyst. In general,
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
266
these materials require a relatively high reaction temperature to be sufﬁciently
active, which inevitably leads to high cracking and high DMH selectivities (172,
183–187).
III.C. Other Solid Acids
III.C.1. Sulfated Zirconia and Related Materials
A variety of solid acids besides zeolites have been tested as alkylation catalysts.
Sulfated zirconia and related materials have drawn considerable attention
because of what was initially thought to be their superacidic nature and their well-
demonstrated ability to isomerize short linear alkanes at temperatures below
423 K. Corma et al. (188) compared sulfated zirconia and zeolite BEA at reaction
temperatures of 273 and 323 K in isobutane/2-butene alkylation. While BEA
catalyzed mainly dimerization at 273 K, the sulfated zirconia exhibited a high
selectivity to TMPs. At 323 K, on the other hand, zeolite BEA produced more
TMPs than sulfated zirconia, which under these conditions produced mainly
cracked products with 65 wt% selectivity. The TMP/DMH ratio was always
higher for the sulfated zirconia sample. These distinctive differences in the
product distribution were attributed to the much stronger acid sites in sulfated
zirconia than in zeolite BEA, but today one would question this suggestion
because of evidence that the sulfated zirconia catalyst is not strongly acidic, being
active for alkane isomerization because of a combination of acidic character and
redox properties that help initiate hydrocarbon conversions (189). The time-on-
stream behavior was more favorable for BEA, which deactivated at a lower rate
than sulfated zirconia. Whether differences in the adsorption of the feed and
product molecules inﬂuenced the performance was not discussed.
In a subsequent publication (22), two sulfated zirconia samples with different
sulfate loadings were reported as alkylation catalysts with isobutane/2-butene
feed at temperatures between 263 and 323 K. The sample with the higher sulfur
loading was slightly more active in the initial reaction phase, and the rates of
deactivation were similar for the two catalysts. The alkylation/cracking ratio
increased with decreasing reaction temperature. 2,2,4-TMP was the dominant
octane isomer under all conditions and less dimethylhexanes and octenes were
produced than with the zeolitic catalysts. In another investigation by the same
authors, sulfate-doped ZrO2, TiO2, and SnO2 were prepared by various sulfation
and activation procedures. The acidity decreased in the order SO4
22/
ZrO2 . SO4
22/TiO2 . SO4
22/SnO2, which was reﬂected in the cracking activities
of the samples. All the oxides showed considerable sensitivity towards the modi-
ﬁcation procedure, each with a different optimum. All the samples deactivated
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
267
rapidly and additionally lost signiﬁcant fractions of the sulfur that was originally
present (190).
Satoh et al. (191) also compared several sulfated metal oxide catalysts, which
were tested with gas-phase reactants at 273 K. This is an inappropriate procedure,
however, because most of the products are liquid under these conditions and
remain in the catalyst pores. The authors of an investigation with pulsed gas-
phase reactants for alkylation with sulfated zirconia catalyst also concluded that
at temperatures below 323 K the TMPs could not desorb from the pores. Raising
the temperature to just 373 K led to dehydrogenation of isobutane (192,193).
Other investigations of alkylation of gas-phase reactants with sulfated zirconia
were reported by Das and Chakrabarty (194) and Guo et al. (195,196). Working
with liquid-phase reactants and employing relatively mild conditions, Xiao et al.
(197) were able to extend the lifetime of a sulfated zirconia catalyst to more than
70 h. In the initial phase, the catalyst produced 80 wt% cracked products, but the
value fell to less than 20 wt% after 30 h TOS with an increase in TMP selectivity
to more than 60 wt%. Within the TMPs, 2,2,4-TMP selectivities became higher
than 60 wt%. Platinum-promoted sulfated zirconia and tungstated zirconia were
found to be much less active alkylation catalysts.
An interesting variation on sulfated metal oxide type catalysts was presented
by Sun et al. (198), who impregnated a dealuminated zeolite BEA with titanium
and iron salts and subsequently sulfated the material. The samples exhibited a
better time-on-stream behavior in the isobutane/1-butene alkylation (the reaction
temperature was not given) than H-BEA and a mixture of sulfated zirconia and
H-BEA. The product distribution was also better for the sulfated metal oxide-
impregnated BEA samples. These results were explained by the higher
concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites of the composite materials than in
H-BEA.
III.C.2. Heteropolyacids
Heteropolyacids are strongly acidic non-porous solids. Salts of these acids
containing large cations, such as Csþ, Kþ, Rbþ, and NH4
þ, exhibit surface areas in
the order of 150 m2/g. Supporting heteropolyacids on highly porous carriers
provide a method to increase the surface area. This was done by Blasco et al.
(199), who used 12-tungstophosphoric acid on silica, on a high-surface-area
amorphous aluminosilicate, and on all-silica mesoporous MCM-41. These
materials were tested for isobutane/2-butene alkylation at 306 K. The acid
supported on silica performed best, with high initial activity and selectivity to
trimethylpentanes. Heteropolyacids supported on the aluminosilicate interacted
strongly with the support, which decreased the acidity, thus leading to lower
activity and selectivity. Heteropolyacids on MCM-41 were observed to partially
block the pores of the support, so that a fraction of the acid was inaccessible
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
268
to the reactants. This effect of pore blocking could be decreased by the use of a
MCM-41 with a larger pore diameter. All the materials deactivated rapidly.
Gayraud et al. (200) tested potassium salts of 12-tungstophosphoric acid with
various potassium loadings to modify acidity and porosity. The samples were
tested at sub- and super-critical conditions. Samples with high potassium content
exhibited better time-on-stream behavior and selectivities than others. The
authors claimed that high acid site density was detrimental for the alkylation
reaction, leading to increased oligomerization activity. This conclusion contra-
dicts the generally accepted notion that high acid site densities enhance the
alkylation activity. The results can be better explained by the decrease in surface
area with decreasing potassium content, which was found to vary from 156 to
50 m2/g.
Cesium salts of 12-tungstophosphoric acid have been compared to the pure
acid and to a sulfated zirconia sample for isobutane/1-butene alkylation at room
temperature. The salt was found to be much more active than either the acid or
sulfated zirconia (201). Heteropolyacids have also been supported on sulfated
zirconia catalysts. The combination was found to be superior to heteropolyacid
supported on pure zirconia and on zirconia and other supports that had been
treated with a variety of mineral acids (202). Solutions of heteropolyacids
(containing phosphorus or silicon) in acetic acid were tested as alkylation
catalysts at 323 K by Zhao et al. (203). The system was sensitive to the hetero-
polyacid/acetic acid ratio and the amount of crystalline water. As observed in
the alkylation with conventional liquid acids, a polymer was formed, which
enhanced the catalytic activity.
III.C.3. Acidic Organic Polymers
Naﬁon-H, a perﬂuorinated sulfonic acid resin, is another strongly acidic solid
that has been explored as alkylation catalyst. Rørvik et al. (204) examined
unsupported Naﬁon-H with a nominal surface area of 0.2 m2/g (surface area of
a swellable polymer is difﬁcult to deﬁne) in isobutane/2-butene alkylation at
353 K and compared it with a CeY zeolite. The zeolite gave a better alkylate and
higher conversion than Naﬁon-H, which produced signiﬁcant amounts of octenes
and heavy-end products. The low surface area of the resin and questions about
the accessibility of the sulfonic acid groups probably make the comparison
inadequate.
To increase the surface area, the resin can be supported on porous carriers, or it
can be directly incorporated into silica by a sol–gel preparation technique. Both
methods have been used by Botella et al. (205), who compared several composite
Naﬁon/silica samples with varying surface areas and Naﬁon loadings for
isobutane/2-butene alkylation at 353 K. Furthermore, supported and unsupported
Naﬁon samples were used. As expected, the unsupported resin with its low
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
269
surface area performed only poorly. The composite materials showed an
optimum performance at intermediate surface areas, which was explained by an
interaction between the sulfonic groups of the resin and the silanol groups of the
silica, decreasing the acid strength of the resin. The supported resin showed
activity and selectivity similar to that of the composite material of the same
Naﬁon content. Changes in the temperature from 305 to 353 K showed that the
material produces oligomers at low temperatures and saturated products at higher
temperatures. This led the authors to claim the catalyst to have an acid strength in
the range characteristic of zeolite BEA and lower than that of sulfated zirconia.
Such a ranking, however, seems obsolete because sulfated zirconia has been
shown to exhibit only a moderate acid strength (Section III.C.1).
III.C.4. Supported Metal Halides
Supported metal halides gained considerable attention as candidate alkylation
catalysts, and at least three companies tested them in pilot plants (206).
Chlorinated alumina, obtained by reacting alumina with hydrogen chloride,
is a highly Brønsted-acidic porous solid. This material is related to the Friedel-
Crafts catalyst aluminum chloride, which was one of the ﬁrst catalysts tested
in alkylation. Similar catalysts are used in commercial alkane isomerization
plants. A series of chlorinated alumina samples modiﬁed with Liþ and Naþ ions
was prepared and tested by Clet et al. (207) for isobutane/2-butene alkylation
at 273 K. The purpose of the cation addition was to moderate the acidity of
the material. It was shown that the cations prevent excessive cracking, and
the time-on-stream behavior is superior to that of the unmodiﬁed sample.
The improvement was attributed to a selective annihilation of very strong
acid sites by the cations. The degradation of 2,2,4-TMP on these catalysts at
273 K was also investigated. 2,2,4-TMP was found to be surprisingly reactive
under these conditions and gave a product resembling an alkylate—but with
more dimethylhexanes and light- and heavy-end products. Emphasis was placed
on the explanation of the rearrangement steps for producing dimethylhexanes
and cracked products, but the initiation of the 2,2,4-TMP degradation was
not discussed. These catalysts are also described in a patent application (208).
A similar type of catalyst including a supported noble metal for regeneration
was described extensively in a series of patents assigned to UOP (209–214).
The catalysts were prepared by the sublimation of metal halides, especially
aluminum chloride and boron triﬂuoride, onto an alumina carrier modiﬁed with
alkali or rare earth-alkali metal ions. The noble metal was preferably deposited
in an eggshell concentration proﬁle. An earlier patent assigned to Texaco (215)
describes the use of chlorinated alumina in the isobutane alkylation with higher
alkenes, especially hexenes. TMPs were supposed to form via self-alkylation.
Fluorinated alumina and silica samples were also tested in isobutane alkylation,
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
270
but were found to produce mainly heavy-end products under the conditions
employed (216).
Patents assigned to Mobil (217) describe the use of boron triﬂuoride supported
on several porous carriers. BF3 supported on silica was found to exhibit a slightly
higher performance with added water in the alkylation of a mixed alkene feed
at 273 K. It was also shown that self-alkylation activity was considerably lower
than that with HF as catalyst. Another patent (218) describes the use of a pillared
layered silicate, MCM-25, promoted with BF3 to give a high-quality alkylate at
temperatures of about 273 K. BF3 was also supported on zeolite BEA, with
adsorbed water still present (219). This composite catalyst exhibited low butene
isomerization activity, which was evident from the inferior results obtained with
1-butene. At low reaction temperatures, the product quality was superior to that
of HF alkylate.
Triﬂic acid has also been supported on a porous silica carrier (220). The
authors emphasized the importance of a strong interaction between the acid and
the support to prevent leaching of the acid. In pulsed liquid-phase isobutane/
1-butene alkylation experiments at 298 K, the catalysts produced a very high-
quality alkylate, made up almost exclusively of isooctanes. With silanol groups
on the silica surface or with added water, triﬂic acid was found to form a
monohydrate that was ﬁrmly grafted to the silica surface.
III.D. The Inﬂuence of Process Conditions
The choice of appropriate reaction conditions is crucial for optimized
performance in alkylation. The most important parameters are the reaction
temperature, the feed alkane/alkene ratio, the alkene space velocity, the alkene
feed composition, and the reactor design. Changing these parameters will induce
similar effects for any alkylation catalyst, but the sensitivity to changes varies
from catalyst to catalyst. Table II is a summary of the most important parameters
employed in industrial operations for different acids. The values given for
zeolites represent best estimates of data available from laboratory and pilot-scale
experiments.
Two points are emphasized: (i) zeolites can be successfully operated at the
same or higher severities (with respect to P/O (feed alkane/alkene) ratio and OSV
(alkene space velocity)) than the liquid acids; (ii) the productivities of zeolite
catalysts (i.e., the total amount of alkylate produced per mass of catalyst) are
roughly the same as of that of sulfuric acid. If the intrinsic activities of zeolites
(which have 0.5–3 mmol of acid sites per gram) are compared with that of
sulfuric acid (which has 20 mmol of acid sites per gram), zeolites outperform
sulfuric acid. Nevertheless, the price of a zeolite catalyst and the high costs of
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
271
effective regeneration set high hurdles for a competition with sulfuric acid-
catalyzed processes.
III.D.1. Reaction Temperature
The reaction temperature affects both the chemistry of alkylation through the
activation energies of the individual reaction steps and the solubility/adsorption
and diffusion of products and reactants. With sulfuric acid, the viscosity is also
strongly inﬂuenced by the temperature. Dispersion effects, such as too low
interfacial areas between acid and hydrocarbons, thus set the lower temperature
limit with sulfuric acid. Temperatures below 277 K inhibit the separation of acid
from the hydrocarbon phase and lead to acid carryover from the acid settler
downstream of the reactor. At temperatures exceeding 291 K, polymerization
reactions dominate, leading to increased acid consumption and low octane
numbers (12). The higher solubility of isobutane in HF and its lower viscosity
allow higher isobutane consumption rates to be applied with HF. Therefore, HF
can be operated at higher temperatures, resulting in higher reaction rates. This
operation also reduces the refrigeration costs. Instead of a true refrigeration
system, cooling water can be used. Nevertheless, the product quality is higher
when the operation is at the lower temperature limit. With increasing
temperature, the rates of side reactions increase. Oligomerization/cracking is
of greater importance at higher temperatures, reducing the selectivity to
trimethylpentanes.

laboratory and pilot scale data obtained in a slurry reactor.

272
Zeolites, in principle, operate at signiﬁcantly higher reaction temperatures than
the liquid acids. The need for higher temperatures is attributed to the lower acid
strengths of zeolites or the lack of solvation, resulting in higher activation
energies for the individual reaction steps. Efﬁcient mobility in the zeolite
micropores also requires higher temperatures. The optimum temperature is in the
range 323–373 K, with the exact value likely depending on the individual
sample. The problem of the optimum reaction temperature is often overlooked in
test for comparison of various catalysts. Testing catalysts at sub-optimum
temperatures leads to false conclusions about the true alkylation performance.
Nivarthy et al. (48) found an optimum for zeolite H-BEA at 348 K, at which
temperature the highest octane selectivity and the highest TMP/DMH ratio were
achieved. At lower temperatures, oligomerization dominated, and at higher
temperatures, cracking reactions dominated. Kirsch et al. (14) tested various rare
earth exchanged Y zeolites at temperatures 298–373 K. A sample with 0.2 wt%
residual sodium had a optimum temperature around 313 K, and a sample with
1.0 wt% sodium performed best at 353 K.
Taylor and Sherwood (222) examined the inﬂuence of several process
parameters on the performance of a USY zeolite. The catalyst was tested at 311,
339, and 367 K. The TMP selectivity decreased steadily with increasing
temperature, and the longest lifetime was achieved at 339 K. Pronounced effects
on the product selectivities were also observed by Corma et al. (140), who used
a H-BEA catalyst at 323 and 353 K. At the higher temperature, the activity was
higher, as indicated by the increased conversion. The selectivity to cracked
products increased drastically, and the C9þ selectivity also increased with
temperature. Within the TMP fraction, 2,2,4-TMP increased signiﬁcantly
with temperature. Feller et al. (89) performed a detailed investigation of the
inﬂuence of the reaction temperature in the range of 313–403 K on the per-
formance of a LaX zeolite. The catalyst lifetime was found to depend strongly
on the reaction temperature, with an optimum at 348 K. The product quality
was highest at low temperatures; with increasing temperatures, increasingly
more cracked and heavy compounds were produced. The TMP/DMH ratio
declined with temperature. The selectivity phenomena can be explained by the
relative rates of the individual reaction steps. b-Scission (and presumably also
alkene addition) are characterized by higher activation energies than hydride
transfer. Increases in temperature consequently lead to higher relative rates of
secondary products from multiple alkylation and cracking. Cracked products
are favored over multiple alkylation products, because the activation energy
is higher for b-scission than for alkene addition, which is the (exothermic)
reverse reaction.
The bad performance of zeolites at low reaction temperatures is most likely a
consequence of the hindered diffusion of bulky molecules under such conditions.
The catalyst will be prematurely deactivated by pore blocking. These diffusion
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
273
problems are the reason why several research groups tried to overcome a buildup
of heavy molecules in the catalyst pores by employing supercritical conditions. A
supercritical reaction medium should combine liquid-like density with high
oligomer solubilities and gas-like transport properties. Under such conditions, the
bulky molecules that otherwise would deactivate the catalyst are supposedly
more efﬁciently removed from the catalyst pores. The feed itself can be employed
as a supercritical medium, but the critical point of isobutane is 408 K and
36.5 bar. Performing the alkylation reaction under these conditions leads to
excessive cracking. The catalyst stays active for longer times than in the con-
ventional operation, but it produces cracked products and especially substantial
amounts of alkeneic products (130,131). To overcome the problems associated
with the high critical temperature of isobutane, carbon dioxide has been used as a
diluent to reduce the critical temperature. The results presented by Clark and
Subramaniam (223) show that a stable conversion can indeed be maintained
with a 10-fold excess of carbon dioxide at 323 K and 155 bar. However, the
conversion was very low (,20 wt%), and the product contained only minor
amounts of trimethylpentanes. Similar results were reported by Santana and
Akgerman (224). Ginosar et al. (225), testing a variety of supercritical solvents
and a variety of solid acids, came to the conclusion that working under super-
critical conditions generally does not improve the alkylation performance.
A temperature-programmed-oxidation analysis of samples coked under super-
critical conditions revealed that the carbonaceous deposits are very similar in
concentration and oxidizability to coke produced under liquid-phase reaction
conditions. The slight changes were related to a smaller amount of coke on the
outer surface of the zeolite (226).
III.D.2. Alkane/Alkene Ratio and Alkene Space Velocity
Rates of reaction are inﬂuenced by reactant concentrations, determined by the
feed composition, and temperature. The crucial parameter that determines a high
alkylate quality and a low acid consumption is the ratio of rates of hydride
transfer and oligomerization. This ratio should be as high as possible. Increasing
the isobutane concentration minimizes undesired reactions and acid consumption
by increasing the probability that the carbenium ion will react with an isobutane
molecule to form the desired product via hydride transfer rather than undergoing
oligomerization with other alkenes. The ratio of rates of hydride transfer to
oligomerization is primarily inﬂuenced by two process parameters: the feed
alkane/alkene (P/O) ratio and the alkene space velocity (OSV, which is appro-
ximately proportional to the reciprocal of the average residence time). The P/O
ratio determines the concentration of isobutane in the reactor and thereby the rate
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
274
of hydride transfer. The P/O ratio also sets the product concentration, which
affects the rates of the product degradation reactions.
Another point might be of importance, although no quantitative data are
available to assess it. Ideally, feed entering the reactor should be instan-
taneously mixed with the acid. The conversion of the alkene in the reactor is
usually complete, so that the internal P/O ratio might be 1000:1 or even higher.
In the case of incomplete mixing, the alkene concentration will be higher at
some positions in the reactor and consequently lead to higher rates of
oligomerization and acid consumption than would occur if mixing were perfect.
With high feed P/O ratios, the detriment of incomplete mixing will be
minimized. Thus, increasing the P/O ratio increases alkylate quality and yield
and decreases acid consumption. On the other hand, at high P/O ratios, more
isobutane has to be recycled, which leads to increased separation costs. A
balance has to be found to optimize the economic performance of the unit. The
OSV determines the production rate of alkylate, so that high OSV would be
economically favored, but this is limited by high acid consumption, low octane
number, and high rates of formation of heavy-end products at high values of
OSV. When the catalyst is sulfuric acid, more esters are introduced into the
products than when the catalyst is hydroﬂuoric acid, and these products corrode
down-stream equipment (221). As a ﬁrst approximation for sulfuric acid-
catalyzed n-butene alkylation, an increase in OSV of 0.1 vol/(vol £ h) leads to a
decrease in RON of about 1, and an increase in the P/O from 8 to 9 leads to an
increase in RON of 0.15 (12). The above-mentioned higher solubility of
isobutane in HF allows higher space velocities in HF plants, although they are
usually operated at higher P/O ratios.
In principle, the same rules hold true when zeolitic alkylation catalysts are
used. A detailed study of the inﬂuence of PO and OSV on the performance of
zeolite H-BEA in a backmix reactor was reported by de Jong et al. (80). The
authors developed a simple model of the kinetics, which predicted catalyst
lifetimes as a function of P/O and OSV. Catalyst lifetime (which is equivalent to
the catalyst productivity, the reciprocal of acid consumption) increased with
increasing P/O ratio and decreasing OSV. Furthermore, the authors persuasively
demonstrated the superiority of a backmix reactor over a plug ﬂow reactor.
Qualitatively similar results were obtained by Taylor and Sherwood (222)
employing a USY zeolite catalyst in a backmix reactor. The authors stressed the
detrimental effect of unreacted alkene on the catalyst lifetime and product
quality. Feller et al. (89) tested LaX zeolites in a backmix reactor and found the
catalyst productivity to be nearly independent of the OSV within the examined
OSV range. At higher values of OSV, the catalyst life was shorter, but in this
shorter time the same total amount of product was produced. The P/O ratio had
only a moderate inﬂuence on the catalyst performance.

III.D.3. Alkene Feed Composition
Propene, 1-butene, 2-butene, isobutylene, and normal- and isopentenes can be
used as feedstocks in alkylation. Depending on the catalyst, they give different
alkylate qualities and yields with differing acid consumptions. Only linear
butenes give a fairly low acid consumption in sulfuric acid-catalyzed processes.
All the other alkenes lead up to three times higher acid consumption (12).
Hydroﬂuoric acid consumption is nearly independent of the feed alkene (227).
The low double bond isomerization activity of HF leads to higher production of
dimethylhexanes when 1-butene is the feed alkene. The high self-alkylation
activity of HF is responsible for a high fraction of TMPs in the alkylate when
alkenes other than butenes are used.
Table III provides a comparison of alkylate compositions for both the liquid
acid-catalyzed reactions with various feed alkenes. The data show that H2SO4
produces a better alkylate with 1-butene, whereas HF gives better results with
propene or isobutylene. The products from 2-butene and also from pentenes (not
shown in Table III) are nearly the same with either acid.
Zeolites have also been tested with feed alkenes other than butenes. Daage and
Fajula (229) reported an investigation of isobutane/propene alkylation with a
CeY zeolite with 13C-labeled feed molecules. The products could be grouped into
those formed by three classes of reactions: dimerization leading to C6 products,
alkylation leading to C7 products, and self-alkylation leading to C8 and also to C7
products. Investigations by Guisnet et al. (69,93) comparing 2-butene and
propene as feed alkenes with a USY zeolite catalyst gave similar results. Self-
alkylation was slower by a factor of two than the alkylation of isobutane with
propene and faster by a factor of two than the dimerization of propene. The
conversion in isobutane/propene alkylation was considerably lower than in
isobutane/2-butene alkylation. A comparative study of zeolite H-BEA-catalyzed
alkylation of isobutane with 2-butene, propene, and ethene was published by
Nivarthy et al. (230). The reactivity of the alkenes decreased in the order 2-
butene . propene . ethene. Here, the products could also be grouped into those
formed by dimerization, alkylation, and self-alkylation. Dimerization is
especially important with ethene, forming n-butenes, which react in the normal
way to give octanes. The distribution within the C8 fraction was almost the same
when ethene was used instead of 2-butene. Ethene exhibits a low reactivity
because it can form only primary carbenium ions, which requires high activation
energies. Ethene is reactive with AlCl3/HCl, but not with sulfuric acid or
hydroﬂuoric acid.
Early investigations of zeolite REHX as a catalyst were done with ethene as
the feed alkene (13). At 300 K, the product was mainly hexanes, whereas at
temperatures as high as 422 K, isopentane dominated, with hexanes and octanes
being the other main products. KTI developed a process which utilizes ethene
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
276
from FCC off-gases to produce alkylate with a zeolite catalyst having a
“dimerization function” (231). The catalyst disclosed consists of a RECaX
zeolite impregnated with palladium as the “dimerization function” (152).
Operated at temperatures in the range of 323–343 K, the catalyst produces a
high yield of octanes and almost no hexanes (153,232,233). Chlorided alumina
was also tested as a catalyst for isobutane/ethene alkylation at temperatures
between 273 and 373 K. Catalyst stability was better at low temperatures than at
high temperatures. Hexanes constituted the main product fraction, especially
at high P/O ratios (234). Thermodynamically, hexanes are strongly favored over
octanes and higher molecular weight products (235).

IV. Industrial Processes and Process Developments
This section is a review of alkylation process technology. The processes in which
liquid acids are used are all mature technologies and described brieﬂy here.
Information about process developments with solid acid catalysts is also
presented.
IV.A. Liquid Acid-Catalyzed Processes
All the processes require intensive mixing of acid and hydrocarbon phases
to form emulsions. The droplets have to be small enough to give a sufﬁciently
large phase boundary area, but they also have to ensure a quick separation
in the settler downstream of the reactor to prevent degradation reactions.
Because of the high viscosity of sulfuric acid, mixing is more of a problem
with sulfuric acid than with hydroﬂuoric acid. In all sulfuric acid-catalyzed
processes impellers have to be employed. In hydroﬂuoric acid processes the
hydrocarbons are typically injected through nozzles, which are sufﬁcient for
effective dispersion.
Because the alkylation reaction is exothermic, a considerable amount of
process heat has to be removed. As HF-catalyzed processes operate at
temperatures between 289 and 313 K, the reactors can be cooled with water.
H2SO4-catalyzed processes operate at temperatures between 277 and 291 K
(Table II) and therefore require more complex cooling systems, which typically
utilize the processed hydrocarbon stream itself.
The feed hydrocarbons, which come from the FCC or from the etheriﬁcation
unit of a petroleum reﬁnery, usually have to be treated before entering the
alkylation unit. They contain water, butadienes, and sulfur- and nitrogen-
containing compounds and—when coming from an etheriﬁcation unit—traces of
oxygenates.
The general treatment of the hydrocarbon stream leaving the alkylation reactor is
similar in all processes. First, the acid and hydrocarbon phases have to be separated
in a settler. The hydrocarbon stream is fractionated in one or more columns to
separate the alkylate from recycle isobutane as well as from propane, n-butane, and
(sometimes) isopentane. Because HF processes operate at higher isobutane/alkene
ratios than H2SO4 processes, they require larger separation units. All hydrocarbon
streams have to be treated to remove impurity acids and esters.
IV.A.1. Sulfuric Acid-Catalyzed Processes
Two licensors now offer sulfuric acid alkylation units. The one with the higher
market share is Stratco, with its Efﬂuent Refrigerated Sulfuric Acid Alkylation
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
278
Process (12). The reactor is a horizontal pressure vessel called Contactore and
containing an inner circulation tube, a heat exchanger tube bundle to remove the
heat of reaction, and a mixing impeller in one end. The hydrocarbon feed and
recycle acid enter on the suction side of the impeller inside the circulation tube.
This design ensures the formation of a ﬁne acid-continuous emulsion. The high
circulation rate prevents signiﬁcant temperature differences within the reactor.
The reactor is shown schematically in Fig. 11.
A portion of the emulsion ﬂows to the settler, where the hydrocarbon phase is
separated from the acid phase. The hydrocarbon phase is expanded and partially
evaporated. The cold two-phase hydrocarbon efﬂuent is passed through the
cooling coils of the contactor reactor and takes up the heat of reaction as it
undergoes evaporation. To increase the efﬁciency of the cooling system, propane
is co-fed to the reactor. The gaseous hydrocarbons are sent to a refrigerant
compressor and separated from excess propane in a depropanizer column. The
acid leaving the settler is recycled into the reactor, with a small stream of fresh
acid continuously replacing the equivalent stream of spent acid. To increase
product quality and reduce acid consumption, the reactor can be staged with
respect to the acid ﬂow; the acid can be passed through up to four contactor
reactors with each reactor being fed with fresh hydrocarbons.
The spent acid strength is maintained at about 90 wt% H2SO4. The molar
isobutane/alkene feed ratio ranges from 7:1 to 10:1. Typical operating alkene
space velocities (LHSV) range from 0.2 to 0.6 h21 (corresponding to WHSVs
from 0.06 to 0.19 h21). The optimum reaction temperatures range from 279 to
283 K, but some units are operated at temperatures up to 291 K.

The second licensor of sulfuric acid-catalyzed alkylation processes is
ExxonMobil, with the stirred auto-refrigerated process (221), a technology
formerly licensed by Kellogg. In this process, the reactor consists of a large
horizontal vessel divided into a series of reaction zones, each equipped with a
stirrer (Fig. 12). The alkene feed is premixed with recycle isobutane and fed in
parallel to all mixing zones, and the acid and additional isobutane enter only the
ﬁrst zone and cascade internally to the other zones. The heat of the reaction is
removed by evaporating isobutane plus added propane from the reaction zones.
Thus, no cooling coils are necessary in this type of process. To minimize
any increase in temperature along the reaction zones, the vessel is divided
into two pressure stages, with the second stage operating at a lower pressure to
decrease the boiling point of the hydrocarbon mixture. The vapors are sent to
the refrigeration section, where they are compressed, condensed, and returned
to the reactor as recycle refrigerant. To prevent a buildup of propane in the
refrigeration section, a slipstream is withdrawn and separated in a depropanizer.
The liquid stream is separated in a settler, from which the acid phase is recycled
into the reactor.
Because of its large reactor volume, the auto-refrigerated process can operate
at very low alkene space velocities of about 0.1 h21 LHSV (WHSV ca. 0.03 h21).
This design helps in increasing the octane number of the product and lowering
acid consumption. The reaction temperature is maintained at about 278 K to
minimize side reactions. Spent acid is withdrawn as 90–92 wt% acid. The
isobutane concentration in the hydrocarbon phase is kept between 50 and
70 vol%.

Stratco offers a process called Alkysafee, proposing the conversion of an
existing HF alkylation unit to use H2SO4 for approximately the same cost as
installing an effective HF mitigation system. The process reuses the reaction and
distillation sections from the existing unit. Refrigeration is carried out with a
closed-loop packaged propane refrigeration section. Emulsion pumps and static
mixers have to be installed to provide the required mixing. Stratco claims the
production of similar or even increased quality alkylate as compared to that of the
former HF plant.
The process ﬂow of the converted unit is similar to that of the time tank units
built between 1938 and 1958 (15,227). In this process, the hydrocarbons are
brought in contact with the acid in a large non-cooled pipe close to the entrance
of a centrifugal pump, which provides mixing and emulsiﬁcation. The heat of
reaction is removed in a chiller (utilizing propane as a refrigerant) situated
downstream of the pump. The emulsion then ﬂows into the time tank, which is a
large vertical vessel containing bafﬂes. Although these units produced a high-
octane alkylate, they were successively shut down or changed over to different
types because of high costs of operation.
IV.A.2. Hydroﬂuoric Acid-Catalyzed Processes
ConocoPhillips offers a process using a non-cooled riser-type reactor (Fig. 13).
The hydrocarbon mixture is introduced through nozzles at the bottom and along
the length of the riser (236). The acid is injected at the bottom. The reactor
contains perforated trays, which help to maintain a high dispersion of the
hydrocarbons in the acid phase. The reaction mixture enters the settler, from
which the acid is withdrawn at the bottom and then cooled in a heat exchanger
with cooling water to remove the heat of the reaction. The cold acid is then fed
back into the reactor. The acid ﬂow is driven by gravity. The hydrocarbons in the
settler are routed to the fractionation section, with an overhead stream of propane
and HF, a side stream of isobutane, another side stream of n-butane, and a
bottoms stream of alkylate leaving the section. The HF is separated from propane
in an HF stripper. The acid is regenerated by distillation to remove ASO and
water. Typical process parameters are temperatures of about 297 K, molar
isobutane/alkene ratios of about 14–15, and acid concentrations of 86–92 wt%.
At the heart of the UOP HF alkylation unit is a vertical reactor-heat exchanger,
shown in Fig. 14. The isobutane–alkene mixture enters the shell of the reactor
through several nozzles, and HF enters at the bottom of the reactor. The reaction
heat is removed by cooling water, which ﬂows through cooling coils inside the
reactor. After phase separation in the settler, the acid is recycled to the reactor.
The hydrocarbon phase together with a slipstream of used acid and makeup
isobutane is sent to the “isostripper”, where the alkylate product, n-butane, and
isobutane are separated. The isobutane is recycled to the reactor. During normal
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
281
operation, the acid is distilled with the product, so that no external regeneration is
necessary. An additional acid regeneration column is still needed, however, for
startup, or when feed contamination occurs.
As a reaction to the pressure imposed on reﬁners operating HF processes,
licensors developed safety systems to reduce the inherent risks. Among the
mitigation systems are high-volume water sprays to “knock down” an acid cloud,
a low acid inventory, and a rapid acid de-inventory system. HF modiﬁers, which
reduce the volatility and the aerosol-forming tendency of HF, are also offered.
ConocoPhillips together with Mobil developed an HF modiﬁer technology
named ReVape to reduce the volatility of the acid. It is claimed that a 60–90%
reduction in airborne acid release relative to that of the unmodiﬁed acid is
Fig. 13. ConocoPhillips HF alkylation reactor (236).
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
282
achieved. The modiﬁer does not undergo a chemical reaction with the acid.
The additive is separated from the alkylate by extraction and recycled within the
alkylation unit. Furthermore, the ASO has to be separated from the additive. The
additive most likely is based upon sulfones. ConocoPhillips claims that when
using the additive the acid concentration can be lowered to 60 wt%.
UOP in a joint venture with ChevronTexaco developed an additive technology
named Alkade. The additive is based on HF salts of amines, which form liquid
“onium” polyhydrogen ﬂuoride complexes with HF, reducing the vapor pressure
of the catalyst; 65% to more than 80% aerosol reduction is claimed with this
additive. As in the ReVape technology, additional separation columns have
to be installed. Both additives are claimed to increase the product octane
number, especially when propene, isobutylene, and pentenes are employed in
the feedstock.
IV.B. Solid Acid-Catalyzed Processes
Processes based on solid acids are not operated on an industrial scale. However,
several companies are developing processes or already offering technology for
licensing. The overall process scheme is similar to that of a liquid acid-based
process, except for the regeneration section, which is necessary with all solid acid
Fig. 14. UOP HF alkylation reactor.
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
283
catalysts. In principle, three regeneration methods have been examined closely:
(1) As in FCC, the hydrocarbons can be burned off the catalyst surface. This
requires a catalyst with extreme temperature stability, which only ultrastable
zeolites achieve. Moreover, as the alkylation process is exothermic and
conducted at low to moderate temperatures, large amounts of process heat
have to be removed.
(2) The catalyst can be treated with a solvent to extract hydrocarbon deposits.
The most straightforward solvent to use is isobutane, which has been shown
to restore catalytic activity only partially. Supercritical solvents have been
tested, but they also lead to only partial restoration of the activity. Super-
critical alkylation to remove the deposits in situ has been shown in Section
III.D.1 to be less effective. It is unlikely that this method of operation will
lead to a competitive process.
(3) The most promising regeneration method and the one that is used in all true
solid acid-catalyzed process developments is a hydrogen treatment at both
reaction and elevated temperature. This typically requires the incorporation
of a hydrogenation function, for example a noble metal, in the catalyst. The
regeneration mechanism depends on the temperature: at low temperatures
(,373 K), highly unsaturated species, which block the acid sites but not the
pores, are hydrogenated. At higher temperatures, hydrocracking of long-
chain alkanes and other hydrocarbons that are too bulky to leave the pores is
the predominant reaction. The fragments formed in this process easily desorb
and leave the pore system.
Although substantial research was devoted to plug-ﬂow reactors, they are not
a good choice for large-scale operation. To achieve a high internal isobutane/
alkene ratio (.200), an enormous amount of isobutane has to be recycled.
Nevertheless, a plug-ﬂow reactor remains attractive because of the simplicity of
its design and operation. When the alkene feed is introduced over the whole
length of the reactor, very low isobutane/alkene ratios can be avoided. However,
in a true ﬁxed-bed reactor the inlet zones would nevertheless suffer from the
higher alkene concentration and deactivate prematurely.
A more appropriate type of reactor would be a backmixed slurry reactor, with
the catalyst suspended in the liquid. Such a system, however, also has obvious
disadvantages, such as the more complex design necessary for suspending the
solid in the liquid and for solid/liquid separation. These disadvantages may be
compensated by intrinsically higher isobutane/alkene ratios (a consequence of the
backmixing), which lower catalyst consumption. Another advantage of a slurry
reactor is the possibility to withdraw spent catalyst for regeneration. In ﬁxed-bed
reactors, the bed can only be regenerated as a whole, so that multiple swing
reactors are necessary for uninterrupted production. Moreover, the attainment of
isothermal operation in slurry reactors is better than in ﬁxed-bed reactors.

284
IV.B.1. UOP Alkylenee Process
UOP offers the Alkylenee process (237) utilizing a vertical riser reactor. A
process scheme is shown in Fig. 15. The pretreated alkene feed is mixed with
recycle isobutane and injected into the riser together with freshly reactivated
catalyst. Both ﬂow concurrently upward in the riser, where the reaction occurs. At
the top of the riser the catalyst particles are disengaged and sink down into the
reactivation zone. The hydrocarbons ﬂow out through the top of the reactor vessel
to the fractionation section, where they are separated into alkylate, n-butane,
isobutane, and light ends including hydrogen. The recycle isobutane is cooled
before re-entering the riser. The reactivation zone is a packed bed with the
catalyst slowly moving downward in a low-temperature stream of isobutane
saturated with hydrogen. Unsaturated molecules on the catalyst are claimed to be
hydrogenated and desorbed from the catalyst surface. The reactivation zone leads
to the bottom of the riser, where the cycle starts again. The catalyst reactivation is
not complete, and so a small slipstream of catalyst is withdrawn and directed to a
reactivation vessel, where the catalyst is regenerated in a semi-batch or batch
mode at elevated temperature in a circulating hydrogen stream. The composition
of the catalyst, which UOP refers to as HAL-100e, has not been disclosed. In
several patents the use of an alumina-supported AlCl3 catalyst modiﬁed with
alkali metal ions and a Ni, Pd, or Pt hydrogenation function is mentioned (see, for
example, Ref. (214)). Obviously, traces of halogen compounds are leached out
Fig. 15. UOP Alkylenee solid acid-catalyzed alkylation process (237).
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
285
of the catalyst, because a product treatment section is necessary. This would
additionally imply that a makeup halogen source is required. The alkene feed has
to be extensively treated to remove di-alkenes, sulfur-, oxygen-, and nitrogen-
containing compounds. The process operates at temperatures of 283–313 K and
at a molar isobutane/alkene ratio of 6–15. No information is available concerning
the alkene space velocity. It is interesting that typical alkene conversions are
between 93–100%, which most likely is a consequence of very short contact
times in the riser reactor. The alkylate RON is claimed to be as high as what is
attained with the existing technology.
IV.B.2. Akzo Nobel/ABB Lummus AlkyCleane Process
Akzo Nobel and ABB Lummus recently started a solid acid-catalyzed
alkylation demonstration plant at a Fortum reﬁnery in Finland (238). The
reactor type used in the so-called AlkyCleane process has not been disclosed.
However, the process utilizes serial reaction stages with distributed alkene feed
injection for high internal isobutane/alkene ratios. The reactor type is claimed
to achieve a high degree of mixing to reduce alkene concentration gradients
throughout the reactor. Multiple reactors are used, which swing between
reaction and regeneration. As in the Alkylenee process, two regeneration
phases with different severities are employed. A mild regeneration at reaction
temperature and pressure with hydrogen dissolved in isobutane is performed
frequently (far before the end of the theoretical catalyst lifetime). When
necessary, the catalyst is fully regenerated at 523 K in a stream of gas-phase
hydrogen. Presumably, each reactor is in (mild) regeneration mode far longer
than in reaction mode.
The catalyst is reported to be a “true solid acid” without halogen ion addition.
In the patent describing the process (239), a Pt/USY zeolite with an alumina
binder is employed. It was claimed that the catalyst is rather insensitive to feed
impurities and feedstock composition, so that feed pretreatment can be less
stringent than in conventional liquid acid-catalyzed processes. The process is
operated at temperatures of 323–363 K, so that the cooling requirements are less
than those of lower temperature processes. The molar isobutane/alkene feed ratio
is kept between 8 and 10. Alkene space velocities are not reported. Akzo claims
that the alkylate quality is identical to or higher than that attained with the liquid
acid-catalyzed processes.
IV.B.3. LURGI EUROFUELw Process
LURGI and Su
¨d-Chemie AG are developing a solid acid-catalyzed alkylation
process termed LURGI EUROFUELw. The reactor is derived from tray
distillation towers. Isobutane and suspended catalyst enter at the top of the
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
286
tower, and the alkene with premixed isobutane is introduced in stages (Fig. 16).
The evolved heat of reaction is most likely dissipated by the evaporation of the
reaction mixture. Thus, the temperature is controlled by the overall pressure and
the composition of the liquid. The catalyst–reactant mixture is agitated by the
boiling mixture of alkylate and isobutane. At the bottom of the column, the
catalyst is separated, and the majority of the alkylate/isobutane mixture is fed into
the separation section. Isobutane is recycled and mixed with the catalyst, which is
fed into the top of the reaction column. Intermittently, the catalyst is exposed to
hydrogen-rich operating conditions to minimize accumulation of unsaturated
compounds on its surface. Infrequent regeneration occurs in a proprietary section
at elevated temperatures.
The catalyst is faujasite derived, with a high concentration of sufﬁciently
strong Brønsted acid sites and a minimized concentration of Lewis acid sites. It
also contains a hydrogenation function. The process operates at temperatures of
about 323–373 K with a molar isobutane/alkene ratio between 6 and 12 and a
higher alkene space velocity than in the liquid acid-catalyzed processes.
Preliminary details of the process concept have been described (240).
IV.B.4. Haldor Topsøe FBAe Process
Haldor Topsøe’s ﬁxed-bed alkylation (FBAe) technology is a compromise
between liquid and solid acid-based processes. It applies a supported liquid-phase
catalyst in which liquid triﬂic (triﬂuoromethanesulfonic) acid is supported on a
porous material (206,241). The acid in the bed is concentrated in a well-deﬁned
catalyst zone, in which all the alkylation chemistry takes place: at the upstream
Fig. 16. LURGI EUROFUELw solid acid-catalyzed alkylation process (240).
A. Feller and J. A. Lercher / Adv. Catal. 48 (2004) 229–295
287
end of the catalyst zone, ester intermediates are formed, which are soluble in the
hydrocarbons and are transported into the acid zone. Here, they react to form the
products and free acid. Thus, the active zone slowly migrates through the bed in
the direction of the hydrocarbon ﬂow, as shown in Fig. 17. The spent acid can be
withdrawn from the reactor without interrupting the production. The acid is
regenerated in a proprietary acid recovery unit, which produces some oil as a by-
product. The products have to be treated to remove trace amounts of acid.
Reaction temperatures are in the range of 273–293 K. The reactor is operated
adiabatically, and the reaction heat is removed by a cooled reactor efﬂuent
recycle (Fig. 18). The process is claimed to be robust against feed impurities.
Feed drying, however, is recommended.

V. Conclusions
The foregoing review of the alkylation mechanism and the inﬂuence of the catalyst
type and reaction conditions show that, in essence, the chemistry is identical with
all the examined acid catalysts, liquid and solid. Differences in the importance of
individual reaction steps originate from the variety of possible structures and
distributions of acid sites of solid catalysts. Changing process parameters induces
similar effects with each of the catalysts; however, the sensitivity to a particular
parameter depends strongly on the catalyst. All the acids deactivate by the
formation of unsaturated polymers, which are strongly bound to the acid.
Liquid acid-catalyzed processes are mature technologies, which are not
expected to undergo dramatic changes in the near future. Solid acid-catalyzed
alkylation now has been developed to a point where the technology can compete
with the existing processes. Catalyst regeneration by hydrogen treatment is the
method of choice in all the process developments. Some of the process
developments eliminate most if not all the drawbacks of the liquid acid processes.
The verdict about whether solid acid-catalyzed processes will be applied in the
near future will be determined primarily by economic issues.
