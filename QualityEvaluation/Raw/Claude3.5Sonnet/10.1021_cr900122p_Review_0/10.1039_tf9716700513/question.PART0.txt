Oxide Catalysts

The exchange reaction of propane with deuterium has been studied over a number of oxide 
surfaces. Exchange 
activity 
in aluminas is virtually 
confined to catalysts activated 
in the temperature 
range 400-8OO0C, 
with a sharp maximum in activity around 530-560C. 
Since these temperatures 
are well in excess of those leading to maximum surface area and to maximum propane adsorption 
(-35OoC), some specific property of the surface must be involved in the exchange reaction. The 
property of the pure alumina catalysts which correlates best with the hydrogen-deuterium exchange 
activity is the Lewis acidity. Blocking 
experiments 
with electron-acceptor 
molecules 
show, however, 
that the reducing centres on the surface play an essential role. In each case the weaker sites are 
important. The hydroxyl groups in alumina are not apparently involved as vehicles for the 
deuterium, and exchange of hydrogen between the alumina hydroxyl groups and the hydrocarbon 
is not an intermediate step in the exchange reaction. 
Silica-alumina catalysts containing less than -80 % A1203 
show no detectable exchange activity 
for the propane-deuterium reaction at room temperature under any conditions of activation and 
only moderate rates of exchange at higher temperatures. On all the oxides studied the exchange of 
propane with deuterium 
is a stepwise 
process involving replacement of one hydrogen atom at a time. 
Catalytic aluminas possess acid-base properties which are responsible for their 
activity in reactions such as the dehydration of a1cohols.l In addition to these 
acid-base properties, catalytic aluminas possess well-marked oxidizing-reducing 
(redox) properties 2-4 which can promote electron-transfer reactions at the alumina 
surface. The investigation now described is part of a programme designed to 
establish whether or not a correlation exists between the redox properties of a series 
of alumina and silica-alumina catalysts and their catalytic power. 
Exchange 
reactions of the hydrogen 
in hydrocarbons with deuterium 
on evaporated 
metal films have been widely investigated and in some cases the basic processes are 
well undertood.. In the exchange reactions in acid solution, proton transfer 
has often been inoked, 
although the postulation of the 
transition state as 
aprotonated 
molecule may, in many cases, be too simple.8 On the other hand, few studies have 
been reported on the exchange reaction on oxide catalysts. Larson and Hall 
have shown 
that the isotopic exchange between CD4 and CH4 
over aluminas 
proceeds 
through surface hydroxyl ions although only a small fraction of these are involved 
in the reaction. According to Trokhimets and Markevich,lo the exchange of ethane 
with deuterium over alumina proceeds by a simple stepwise mechanism involving 
the replacement of one hydrogen atom at each step. A number of workers have 
shown that alumina catalysts are more active in hydrogen-deuterium exchange 
than are alumina catalysts containing silica.g*

ELECTRON-TKANSPEK A N D  CA'I'ALY TIC ACTIVITY 
The object of the present study was to see whether a correlation exists between 
catalytic activity for the exchange of the hydrogen in n-propane with deuterium and 
electron-transfer activity of the oxide surface. Parallel measurements of surface 
acidity, surface area and propane adsorption are also reported. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
MATERIALS 
The aluminiuni trihydroxide (97 % gibbsite, 3 "/o bayerite), subsequently referred to as 
gi 
bbsite, has been described previously.2 The commercial sample of silica-alumina was 
supplied by the Agricultural Division of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. It contained 
-13 % A1203 and had a surface area, measured by nitrogen adsorption using the B.E.T. 
method, of 450 m2 
g-l after calcination at 525C 
; 
the principal transition-metal impurities 
were Fe (0.04 %), V (0.004 %) and Ni (0.001 %). 
The sample was washed in hot distilled 
water and dried at 120C before being activated. 
A series of alumina catalysts containing various percentages of silica was prepared by 
standard procedures using aluminium isopropoxide (laboratory chemical grade reagent 
from British Drug Houses Ltd) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (laboratory chemical grade 
reagent further purified by distillation at 70C under reduced pressure). In some cases 
the solution containing aluminium isopropoxide and tetraethyl orthosilicate was kept in 
a water-filled ultrasonic tank operated at 22 kHz for about 1 1
1
 after mixing the reagents. 
The alumina, silica and sodium content, and the surface area determined by nitrogen adsorp- 
tion using the B.E.T. method, of representative silica-alumina samples prepared in this 
manner are shown in table 1.

temperature, 570C 
Activation of all catalyst samples involved pretreatment in flowing oxygen in an electric 
muffle furnace for 1 h at temperatures between 100 and 11OO"C, followed by cooling at 
mmHg over phosphoric oxide for 30 min. The catalyst was then transferred to the 
reaction vessel used for the exchange experiments, or to the side-arm of the reaction tube 
used for the e.s.r. measurements, where it was further heated for 1 h with continuous pumping 
at the same temperatwe as that used in the pretreatment, followed by two 1.5 h heating 
periods in 10 an 
of oxygen with a 30 min interval for evacuation between the oxygen treat- 
ments. The sample was subsequently outgassed at the same temperature for 11 h at a 
pressure of loF5 
mmHg or better. 
Deuterated alumina was prepared by two methods. A small sample (-0.3 g) of gibbsite 
was heated at 540C for 2 h in oxygen and subsequently for 6 h at a pressure of lo-' mmHg 
(with continuous pumping). The sample was then treated at the same temperature with 
10 cm of deuterium for 2 h, outgassed, heated with oxygen for 1 
h, and finally outgassed 
for 6 h at a pressure of loe5 mmHg or better. In the other method of preparation, a 0.3 g 
gibbsite sample 
was also heated at 540C 
for 2 h in oxygen and pumped for 6 h at 
mmHg, 
but the sample was then allowed to cool to room temperature and 5 ml of deuterium oxide

evacuate-thaw cycles, introduced. After 12 
h the water was removed by pumping and the 
catalyst reactivated by heating for 16 h at 540C 
and at a pressure of lods 
mmHg or better. 
n-Propane supplied by Matheson Co. 
was further purified by distillation 
from cold traps, 
only the middle fraction being taken during the final distillation. Perdeuteropropane from 
Merck Sharp and Dohme was further purified by the same method. Matheson deuterium 
had a specified purity of 99.5 % and was subjected to diffusion through a heated palladium 
thimble and passage through a liquid-nitrogen trap before use. 
A P P A R A T U S  A N D  PROCEDURE 
MASS-SPECTROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS 
The catalytic exchange of propane with deuterium was conducted in a static reaction 
system from which the reaction mixture was bled continuously through a capillary leak into 
a Metropolitan-Vickers MS2 mass spectrometer with the loss of some 2 %/h. The quartz 
reaction vessel had a total volume of about 170ml and incorporated a ground-quartz 
joint which carried a bent side-arm that terminated in a bulb of -5 ml capacity. In the 
blocking experiments, a solution of adsorbate held in the small bulb could be transferred to 
the main body of the reaction vessel by rotation of the side-arm. A known weight of catalyst 
( 
-0.1 g alumina or - 
1.2 g silica-alumina) 
was activated in the reaction vessel by the method 
already described. A standard reaction mixture of 10 mm propane and 60 mm deuterium 
was used (the hydrocarbon always being admitted to the mixing bulb before the deuterium), 
and this was passed through a trap at 0C to reduce the amount of mercury vapowr entering 
the reaction vessel. Under these conditions the number of propane molecules in the vessel 
at the start of an experiment was 3 . 6   
10l9. 
In experiments where it was desired to block the alumina surface with an organic 
adsorbate, the procedure for activating the catalyst differed from that already described 
in that the outgassing of the sample was reduced from 11 to 8 h. The reaction vessel was 
cooled to room temperature and the side-arm, containing a 4 ml solution of the adsorbate 
in hexane, was substituted for the ground-quartz stopper. A flow of dry nitrogen was 
maintained over the catalyst sample while the side-arm was being attached. The solution 
was deaerated by 4 or 5 cycles of freezing, pumping and thawing, and stored by freezing 
in a bath of solid carbon dioxide in ethanol. The reaction vessel was opened to the vacuum 
line and the temperature of the catalyst raised to that at which the sample had been activated. 
This procedure was adopted to prevent the water that was evolved during the initial heating 
of the catalyst from entering the side-arm. The catalyst sample was again heated in 10 
cm 
of oxygen and outgassed for a further 3 h, thus making the total period of activation -16 h 
as in the other experiments. The organic solution was allowed to melt, decanted on to the 
catalyst and after a period of 2 h the solvent was carefully removed by pumping. 
Mass-spectrometric analyses were carried out with an electron beam of 18 eV nominal 
energy. An account of the method of analysis has been given previously.12 The agreement 
between propane equilibrium distributions calculated by classical theory and those deter- 
mined experimentally (see, e.g., table 2) is evidence that the method was satisfactory.

RESULTS 
EXCHANGE OF PROPANE W I T H  DEUTERIUM ON ALUMINA 
The course of a typical reaction between propane and deuterium on an alumina 
surface is shown in fig. 1. The various isotopic propanes appeared consecutively, 
the initial product of exchange being C3H7D. Fig. 1 also shows the linear rate 
plots for this exchange reaction obtained by using eqn (1) and (2) ; 
the rate of entry 
of deuterium atoms into propane molecules expressed as a percentage and the dis- 
appearance of light propane can thus be accurately described by the first-order rate 
constants k4 and kx. A series of experiments showed that the initial rates of reaction 
were proportional to the weight of catalyst within an error of about 6 "/o.

The effect of variation in the temperature of dehydration upon the catalytic 
activity of gibbsite for the propane-deuterium reaction at 20C is shown in fig. 2. 
Significant activity for this isotopic exchange reaction at 20C developed only at 
dehydration temperatures above 400C. When dehydrated at 3OO0C, gibbsite was 
inactive for the exchange even at a reaction temperature of 290C. Samples 
dehydrated above 900C were also virtually inactive. Maximum exchange activity 
was observed on gibbsite dehydrated at -550C; these samples gave a value for 
k, of 8 . 2   
% s-l g-l, corresponding to 4 . 7   
% s-l m-2, at a reaction 
temperature of 20C, and a value of 4.2 x 10-1 % s-l g-l at 55C. For gibbsite 
dehydrated in the range 475-900C the activation energy of the exchange reaction, 
calculated from the Arrhenius plot, had a value of 8.750.6 kcal mol-l. 
This 
would suggest that the exchange proceeds by the same mechanism over all active 
samples of alumina. In all experiments with these samples the value of M, the 
ratio of k4 and kx, 
was close to unity (0.93-1.05). A simple exchange mechanism 
must therefore be operating with stepwise replacement of the hydrogen atoms in 
the hydrocarbon by deuterium. Isotopic species containing two or more deuterium 
atoms are formed only by successive reactions. This is supported by the fact that 
the initial product of exchange was C3H7D. 
Athough the propane molecule possesses two kinds of hydrogen atom-the 
six in the methyl groups and the two in the methylene group-it 
was not possible

with the calculated distribution. N.m.r. measurements proved more helpful on 
this point. The 100MHz proton spectrum for C3H8 in deuterochloroform was 
compared with the corresponding spectrum for C3Hs+C3H7D 
(ratio 7 : 
1) in the 
same solvent. The intensity of the signal corresponding to the methylene protons 
relative to that for the methyl protons was lower for the latter spectrum. Moreover, 
in this spectrum the peaks of the methylene quartet were broader than those recorded 
for deuterochloroform containing C3Hs only; the peaks of the methyl triplet were 
equally sharp in both spectra. These observations suggest that the exchange of the 
secondary hydrogens in propane is slightly more rapid than exchange of the primary 
hydrogens. 
To obtain some idea of the true kinetics of the exchange reaction l 3  several 
experiments were carried out using different pressures of propane and deuterium 
over gibbsite samples dehydrated at 600C. The rate of disappearance of light 
propane obeyed the relationship 
This kinetic dependence is similar to that observed for propane on rhodium l4 and 
shows that deuterium is much more strongly adsorbed than propane on alumina. 
EXCHANGE OF PROPANE WITH DEUTERIUM O N  SILICA-ALUMINA 
In comparison with alumina, silica-aluminas are catalytically much less active 
for the propane-deuterium exchange reaction, although the optimum temperature 
of activation is about the same (fig. 3). With a laboratory-prepared silica-alumina

containing N 13 
A1203, 
no exchange 
activity was observed at reaction temperatures 
much below 400C. The most active samples of this catalyst, obtained by dehydrating 
at about 530"C, reduced the concentration of light propane by less than 3 % in 
50 min at 400C. Fig. 3 shows the effect of variation in the temperature of dehydra- 
tion upon the exchange activity of this 13 % Al,03 catalyst at 475C. The activa- 
tion energy for the exchange was 16.0k0.8 kcal mol-1 and M varied between 0.93 
and 1.10. Possibly an important, though not a decisive, factor governing the rate 
of exchange over this catalyst is the low surface concentration of propane at elevated 
reaction temperatures. No adsorption of propane could be detected at 400C on 
a sample of silica-alumina (13 % AI20,) dehydrated at 505"C, whereas a similarly 
activated sample of the same catalyst adsorbed 6.74ml (s.t.p.) of propane per g 
at 20C whenplp, = 0.3.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of adsorption of perylene on the exchange activity of 
alumina. For gibbsite dehydrated at 540C 
the number of oxidizing sites determined 
by e.s.r. measurements using perylene as adsorbate was 8.5 x lo1 g-l, corresponding 
to 1.41 
x 
mol perylene per g catalyst. When ten times this quantity of perylene 
was added per g catalyst, k, was reduced from 1.1 x 10-1 % s-l g-1 (this alumina 
sample had been treated with hexane, which was later removed by pumping as 
in the experiments 
involving solutions of perylene in hexane) to 4.2 x 
% s-l 8-l 
at 24C. Poisoning of all the sites that are active for perylene oxidation produced 
no significant reduction in exchange activity (fig. 5). The presence of 0.5 ml (s.t.p.) 
oxygen in the reaction vessel had only a marginal effect on the catalytic activity 
(fig. 5) 
and the violet colour due to the radical species on the alumina surface persisted. 
Because TCNE sublimed at 45C i
n
 vacuo the removal of hexane was accomplished 
by pumping the system for 4 h at room temperature. The adsorption of TCNE on 
the alumina surface had a drastic effect on the exchange activity, as shown in fig. 5. 
Thus, the blocking of 60 % of the sites active for the reduction of TCNE rendered 
the catalyst practically inactive 
for the propane + 
deuterium 
reaction (k, = 3 
x 
% 
s-l g-1 at 24C). 
Blocking of the alumina surface with TNB had a similar, though less marked, 
effect on the exchange 
activity (fig. 5). Adsorption of m-dinitrobenzene (not recorded 
in this fig.) also reduced the activity but to a smaller extent than TNB. Thus, kx 
for a catalyst sample containing 1.48 
x 
mol m-dinitrobenzene per g was 
4.7 x

the corresponding figure for TNB was 1.6 x

The isotopic exchange reaction was investigated after the adsorptioii of 1.75 x

p-dimethylaminoazobenzene would block 2.5 and 5 % respectively of the acidic 
sites of strength equivalent to 3 x

KEDOX ACTIVITY A N D  SURFACE ACIDITY OF ALUMINA 
To get comparative data for the exchange activity and electron-transfer activity, 
the gibbsite was dehydrated under identical conditions to that used for the exchange 
studies and perylene, TCNE and TNB were used separately as adsorbates. The 
results are presented in fig. 6. Neither the oxidizing nor reducing ability of alumina 
correlates closely with the catalytic activity of the catalyst for the propane + 
deuterium 
reaction when these properties are plotted as a function of activation temperature. 
The dehydration temperature leading to maximum exchange activity (550C) is 
considerably lower than that required for maximum oxidizing power (740C) and 
for maximum reducing ability (TCNE ; 
high temperature maximum, 600C ; 
TNB, 
7OO0C), i.e., alumina becomes a less active exchange catalyst in the temperature

The effect of activation temperature on the surface acidity of gibbsite dehydrated

using four Hammett (Ho) 
indicators and two indicators of the arylmethanol (HR) 
class. Diphenylmethanol and triphenylmethanol gave no surface colouration with 
any alumina sample dehydrated between 400 and 1000C. Consequently, alumina 
has no HR acidity stronger than 50 % sulphuric acid. All four Ho acidity-activation 
temperature curves showed a pronounced maximum at about 590C 
; 
only the curve 
obtained when p-dimethylaminoazobenzene was used as indicator is shown in fig. 6 
At this activation temperature the number of acidic centres was as follows : 1.8 x

2.3 x lozo

SURFACE AREA OF ALUMINA A N D  PROPANE ADSORPTION O N  ALUMINA 
Under certain conditions of activation catalytic 
aluminas 
possess very large surface 
areas. It is therefore conceivable that the data already presented could, in part, be 
explained by a corresponding variation of surface area with dehydration temperature. 
To test this hypothesis the sutface area of a number of alumina samples was deter- 
mined by the B.E.T. method using nitrogen as adsorbate, and the results are shown 
in fig. 2. The area is a maximum for samples heated at -350C and it decreases 
rapidly for samples activated at higher temperatures, which is the temperature range 
where exchange activity, radical-forming 
ability and acidity all show a rapid increase. 
The uptake of propane by alumina samples dehydrated at different temperatures 
was also studied. The plot so obtained (not shown) was similar in shape to the 
surface area-activation temperature curve and it too was characterized by a maximum 
at -350C. 
DISCUSSION 
Hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity in aluminas is virtually confined to 
catalysts activated in the temperature range 40O-80O0C, with a sharp maximum in 
activity around 530-560C. Since these temperatures are well in excess of those 
leading to maximum surface area (fig. 2) and to maximum propane adsorption, 
some specific property of the surface must be involved in the exchange reaction. 
Catalysts activated at 350"C, e.g., having maximum surface area and propane adsorp- 
tion, were almost inactive for the propane + 
deuterium exchange reaction. 
In contrast to the active pure aluminas, 
which brought about rapid D-H 
exchange 
at room temperature, silica-alumina catalysts containing less than - 
80 % A1203 
showed no detectable exchange activity at room temperature under any conditions 
of activation and only moderate rates of exchange at higher temperatures. This 
striking difference between the pure aluminas and the catalysts containing silica is 
clearly of fundamental interest in relation both to the exchange reaction and to 
the nature of the catalytic surfaces. The almost negligible activity found in 
the silica-alumina catalysts indicates clearly that Bronsted acid centres, which are 
freely available on the silica-alumina surface,l are not important in the catalytic 
exchange reaction. Also, a mechanism for the exchange involving the C3H$

carbonium ion can be excluded. The possibility that the exchange reaction on the 
alumina surface may occur on passive Bronsted sites l7 can equally be excluded. 
Since the hydrogen in propane exchanges 
readily with deuterium at room tempera- 
ture over alumina, it is significant that the rate of exchange of the deuterium in 
perdeuteropropane with the hydrogen of alumina is negligible under these conditions, 
as is the exchange of the hydrogen in propane with deuterated alumina. In the 
latter cases, exchange is only observed at much higher temperatures. These results 
indicate that the hydroxyl groups in alumina are not involved as vehicles for the 
deuterium and that the exchange of hydrogen between the alumina hydroxyl groups 
and the hydrocarbon is not an intermediate step in the exchange reaction. 
Hydrogen-deuterium exchange activity is present in alumina which exhibits 
both electron-donor and electron-acceptor properties (redox properties) and is 
virtually absent in the typical cracking catalysts of low alumina content (<25 "/o 
AZ,O3) which are powerful electron-acceptors but have only feeble reducing activity. 
Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that high reducing activity is alone decisive for 
the exchange process. Both partially dehydrated calcium and magnesium oxides 
possess well-marked electron-donor proper tie, yet neither oxide is active for the 
propane + 
deuterium exchange reaction at room temperature, although above 300C 
some exchange activity is observed (see table 4). 
The property of the pure alumina catalysts which correlates best with the hydrogen- 
deuterium exchange activity is the Lewis acidity (fig. 6). It is notable that the tempera- 
ture of activation leading to maximum oxidizing power in the aluminas is considerably 
higher than that which produces maximum Lewis acidity, since it is reasonable to 
conclude that closely-related 
surface sites are involved. This must mean that electron- 
deficient centres sufficiently powerful to bring about electron transfer are still being 
produced at temperatures at which the total number of electron-deficient centres is 
decreasing. 
Present results indicate that these weaker electron-deficient sites, which are 
capable of Lewis acid-Lewis base reactions but which are insufficiently strong to 
bring about cation-radical formation, are involved in the exchange reaction with 
propane. There is other evidence that in hydrogen-deuterium exchange the electron 
affinity of the catalytic sites may be critical. Ichikawa et aZ.18 have shown that 
although H-D 
exchange activity is found in a wide range of electron donor-acceptor 
complexes, maximum activity is confined to a small range of complexes in which the 
electron affinity of the acceptor molecules lies at intermediate values. Complexes 
involving either stronger or weaker acceptor molecules are much less effective. If 
the electron donor in the complex is replaced, however, acceptor molecules occupying 
another narrow range of electron affinities give rise to optimum H-D 
exchange 
activity. 
These broad conclusions receive strong support from the results of the blocking 
experiments with electron donor and acceptor molecules. Whereas total poisoning 
of the oxidizing centres with perylene has no more than a marginal effect on the 
exchange activity, blocking of even 20 % of the reducing centres with TCNE or of 
40 % of the reducing sites with TNB has a marked effect on exchange (fig. 5). Even 
more striking is the poisoning effect of the Hammett indicators which block the Lewis 
acid centres (table 5). These findings support the view that for the exchange reaction 
between propane and deuterium to occur readily both electron-donor and electron- 
acceptor sites are required. In each case, however, it is the weaker sites that are 
important. As shown in table 5, the stronger the Hammett base the more virulent 
is its behaviour. TCNE with a higher electron affinity than TNB is amore 
important 
poison (fig. 5).
