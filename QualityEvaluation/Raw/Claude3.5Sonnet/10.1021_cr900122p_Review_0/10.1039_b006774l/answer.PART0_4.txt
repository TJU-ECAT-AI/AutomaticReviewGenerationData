[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

[2] "The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

[3] "All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

The literature describes how isolated aluminum centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (in this case, propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process was previously known for heavy metals and noble metals, but is now shown to occur with aluminum sites as well.

The study does not specifically discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction. It also does not mention the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the research provides insights into the fundamental steps of C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces, which could be relevant to understanding and improving industrial catalytic processes.

The mechanism described involves the following steps:
1. Propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites.
2. Aluminum inserts into a C-H bond.
3. Hydrogen migrates from aluminum to an oxygen atom.
4. The chemisorption products further react to form hydrogen and propene.

This mechanism demonstrates how isolated metal centers can activate C-H bonds in alkanes, which is a crucial step in many catalytic processes. While the study focuses on propane and aluminum hydroxide clusters, the principles could potentially be applied to other alkanes and metal oxide catalysts in industrial processes.

文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立铝中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化。该机制涉及金属离子催化，其中配位不饱和的铝插入烷烃（在本例中为丙烷）的C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程之前已知适用于重金属和贵金属，但现在证明也适用于铝位点。

研究没有具体讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H-抽提。它也没有提到烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。然而，这项研究提供了对氧化物表面C-H键活化基本步骤的洞察，这可能与理解和改进工业催化过程有关。

所描述的机制包括以下步骤：
1. 丙烷加到配位不饱和的铝位点上。
2. 铝插入C-H键中。
3. 氢从铝迁移到氧原子上。
4. 化学吸附产物进一步反应形成氢气和丙烯。

这个机制展示了孤立金属中心如何活化烷烃中的C-H键，这是许多催化过程中的关键步骤。虽然该研究集中在丙烷和氢氧化铝簇上，但这些原理可能适用于工业过程中的其他烷烃和金属氧化物催化剂。
