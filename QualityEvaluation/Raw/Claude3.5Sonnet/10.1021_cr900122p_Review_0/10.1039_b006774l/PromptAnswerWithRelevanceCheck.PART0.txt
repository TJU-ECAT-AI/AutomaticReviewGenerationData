[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

[2] "The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

[3] "All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

[4] "Thus, the reaction mechanism consists of the insertion of aluminium into the CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration from Al to O, just as for hydrogen chemisorption."

The literature discusses how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum, on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involved is metal ion catalysis, rather than the Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms.

According to the calculations, the process occurs through:
1. Insertion of the aluminum into the C-H bond
2. Migration of the hydrogen from aluminum to an oxygen atom

This mechanism is different from what was previously thought for aluminum, which was expected to behave more like a Brønsted acid site. The study shows that coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites (with 3 or 4 oxygen neighbors) can activate C-H bonds through metal ion catalysis, similar to how noble metals behave.

The literature does not specifically discuss the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the insights about C-H activation by aluminum could potentially be applied to understand or improve such processes, as C-H activation is often a key step in selective oxidation reactions.

这篇文献讨论了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，如何促进非均相催化中的C-H键活化。涉及的机理是金属离子催化，而不是Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。

根据计算，该过程通过以下步骤进行：
1. 铝插入C-H键
2. 氢从铝迁移到氧原子

这种机理与之前对铝的认知不同，之前认为铝会更像布朗斯特酸位点。研究表明，配位不饱和的铝位点（具有3或4个氧邻居）可以通过金属离子催化活化C-H键，类似于贵金属的行为。

这篇文献并没有具体讨论烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。然而，关于铝活化C-H键的见解可能会被应用于理解或改进此类过程，因为C-H键活化通常是选择性氧化反应的关键步骤。

The literature describes how isolated aluminum centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (e.g. propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is different from traditional mechanisms like Mars-van Krevelen or H-abstraction.

The study shows that both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites (Al(O)n with n=3,4) can catalyze this reaction. After the initial C-H activation, the chemisorbed products further react to form hydrogen and alkenes (e.g. propene).

While the literature does not specifically discuss the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, the principles of C-H activation by isolated metal centers could potentially be applied to such processes. However, the study focuses on aluminum rather than the transition metals typically used in selective oxidation catalysts.

The research challenges previous assumptions that such reactions were solely due to acid-base catalysis, showing that metal ion catalysis by aluminum can play an important role in C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces.

文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立铝中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化。该机制涉及金属离子催化，其中配位不饱和的铝插入烷烃(如丙烷)的C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程与传统的Mars-van Krevelen或H-抽取等机制不同。

研究表明，三配位和四配位的铝位点(Al(O)n，n=3,4)都可以催化这种反应。在初始C-H活化之后，化学吸附的产物进一步反应生成氢气和烯烃(如丙烯)。

虽然文献没有具体讨论丁烷到马来酸酐的工业选择性氧化，但孤立金属中心C-H活化的原理可能适用于此类过程。然而，该研究主要关注铝，而不是选择性氧化催化剂中通常使用的过渡金属。

这项研究挑战了先前认为此类反应仅由酸碱催化引起的假设，表明铝的金属离子催化在氧化物表面的C-H键活化中可以发挥重要作用。

The literature discusses C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically focusing on aluminum hydroxide clusters. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is different from traditional acid-base catalysis mechanisms previously assumed for such reactions.

The study does not directly discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction. It also does not mention the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The paper focuses on propane reactions with aluminum hydroxide clusters as model systems for understanding C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces.

The research shows that both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum centers can catalyze chemisorption and dehydrogenation of alkanes. This insight could be relevant to understanding catalysis in broken lattices of zeolites or for extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites, where such coordinatively unsaturated sites might be present.

While the study provides valuable insights into C-H bond activation mechanisms on oxide-supported metal centers, it does not directly address industrial applications or specific oxidation reactions like butane to maleic anhydride conversion.

这篇文献讨论了氧化物材料上孤立金属中心的C-H键活化,特别关注氢氧化铝簇。其机理涉及金属离子催化,其中配位不饱和的铝插入C-H键,随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程不同于之前假设的此类反应的传统酸碱催化机理。

研究没有直接讨论Mars van Krevelen机理或H-抽象。它也没有提到烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。这篇论文主要关注丙烷与氢氧化铝簇的反应,作为理解氧化物表面C-H键活化的模型系统。

研究表明,三配位和四配位的铝中心都可以催化烷烃的化学吸附和脱氢。这一见解可能与理解沸石破碎晶格或蒸汽处理沸石中的骨架外铝物种的催化有关,因为在这些地方可能存在这种配位不饱和的位点。

虽然该研究为氧化物负载金属中心上的C-H键活化机理提供了有价值的见解,但并未直接涉及工业应用或特定的氧化反应,如丁烷到顺丁烯二酸酐的转化。

The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum, on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (in this case, propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is different from the previously assumed mechanisms involving hydron transfer or carbocation intermediates.

The study shows that both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites (Al(O)n with n = 3 and 4) are active in this metal ion catalysis. The aluminum-alkyl pathway is energetically favored over the oxygen-alkyl pathway. Primary C-H bonds are found to be more reactive than secondary C-H bonds in this process.

After the initial C-H activation, the chemisorption products further react to form hydrogen and an alkene (propene in this case), which remain complexed with the aluminum cluster. This suggests a dehydrogenation mechanism.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction, it presents a different mechanism for C-H activation that involves direct interaction with the metal center.

The document does not provide information on the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers could potentially be applied to improve understanding and design of catalysts for such processes.

文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，如何在多相催化中促进C-H键的活化。该机制涉及金属离子催化，其中配位不饱和的铝插入烷烃（在本例中为丙烷）的C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程与之前假设的涉及质子转移或碳正离子中间体的机制不同。

研究表明，三配位和四配位的铝位点（Al(O)n，其中n = 3和4）在这种金属离子催化中都是活性的。铝-烷基路径在能量上比氧-烷基路径更有利。在这个过程中，发现伯C-H键比仲C-H键更具反应性。

在初始C-H活化之后，化学吸附产物进一步反应形成氢气和烯烃（在本例中为丙烯），它们与铝簇保持络合状态。这表明存在一个脱氢机制。

虽然文献没有特别讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H-抽提，但它提出了一种不同的C-H活化机制，涉及与金属中心的直接相互作用。

该文档没有提供关于烷烃工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子的信息。然而，对孤立金属中心上C-H活化机制的见解可能有助于改进对此类过程的催化剂理解和设计。

The literature describes how isolated aluminum centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (in this case, propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process was previously known for heavy metals and noble metals, but is now shown to occur with aluminum sites as well.

The study does not specifically discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction. It also does not mention the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the research provides insights into the fundamental steps of C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces, which could be relevant to understanding and improving industrial catalytic processes.

The mechanism described involves the following steps:
1. Propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites.
2. Aluminum inserts into a C-H bond.
3. Hydrogen migrates from aluminum to an oxygen atom.
4. The chemisorption products further react to form hydrogen and propene.

This mechanism demonstrates how isolated metal centers can activate C-H bonds in alkanes, which is a crucial step in many catalytic processes. While the study focuses on propane and aluminum hydroxide clusters, the principles could potentially be applied to other alkanes and metal oxide catalysts in industrial processes.

研究没有具体讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H-抽提。它也没有提到烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。然而，这项研究提供了对氧化物表面C-H键活化基本步骤的洞察，这可能与理解和改进工业催化过程有关。

1. 丙烷加到配位不饱和的铝位点上。
2. 铝插入C-H键中。
3. 氢从铝迁移到氧原子上。
4. 化学吸附产物进一步反应形成氢气和丙烯。

这个机制展示了孤立金属中心如何活化烷烃中的C-H键，这是许多催化过程中的关键步骤。虽然该研究集中在丙烷和氢氧化铝簇上，但这些原理可能适用于工业过程中的其他烷烃和金属氧化物催化剂。
