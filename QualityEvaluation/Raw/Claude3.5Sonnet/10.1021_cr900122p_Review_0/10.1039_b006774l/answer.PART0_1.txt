[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

[2] "We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

[3] "The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium."

[4] "All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

The literature describes how isolated aluminum centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (e.g. propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is different from traditional mechanisms like Mars-van Krevelen or H-abstraction.

The study shows that both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites (Al(O)n with n=3,4) can catalyze this reaction. After the initial C-H activation, the chemisorbed products further react to form hydrogen and alkenes (e.g. propene).

While the literature does not specifically discuss the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, the principles of C-H activation by isolated metal centers could potentially be applied to such processes. However, the study focuses on aluminum rather than the transition metals typically used in selective oxidation catalysts.

The research challenges previous assumptions that such reactions were solely due to acid-base catalysis, showing that metal ion catalysis by aluminum can play an important role in C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces.

文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立铝中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化。该机制涉及金属离子催化，其中配位不饱和的铝插入烷烃(如丙烷)的C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程与传统的Mars-van Krevelen或H-抽取等机制不同。

研究表明，三配位和四配位的铝位点(Al(O)n，n=3,4)都可以催化这种反应。在初始C-H活化之后，化学吸附的产物进一步反应生成氢气和烯烃(如丙烯)。

虽然文献没有具体讨论丁烷到马来酸酐的工业选择性氧化，但孤立金属中心C-H活化的原理可能适用于此类过程。然而，该研究主要关注铝，而不是选择性氧化催化剂中通常使用的过渡金属。

这项研究挑战了先前认为此类反应仅由酸碱催化引起的假设，表明铝的金属离子催化在氧化物表面的C-H键活化中可以发挥重要作用。
