[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

[2] "The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

[3] "All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

The literature discusses C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically focusing on aluminum hydroxide clusters. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is different from traditional acid-base catalysis mechanisms previously assumed for such reactions.

The study does not directly discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction. It also does not mention the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The paper focuses on propane reactions with aluminum hydroxide clusters as model systems for understanding C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces.

The research shows that both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum centers can catalyze chemisorption and dehydrogenation of alkanes. This insight could be relevant to understanding catalysis in broken lattices of zeolites or for extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites, where such coordinatively unsaturated sites might be present.

While the study provides valuable insights into C-H bond activation mechanisms on oxide-supported metal centers, it does not directly address industrial applications or specific oxidation reactions like butane to maleic anhydride conversion.

这篇文献讨论了氧化物材料上孤立金属中心的C-H键活化,特别关注氢氧化铝簇。其机理涉及金属离子催化,其中配位不饱和的铝插入C-H键,随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程不同于之前假设的此类反应的传统酸碱催化机理。

研究没有直接讨论Mars van Krevelen机理或H-抽象。它也没有提到烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。这篇论文主要关注丙烷与氢氧化铝簇的反应,作为理解氧化物表面C-H键活化的模型系统。

研究表明,三配位和四配位的铝中心都可以催化烷烃的化学吸附和脱氢。这一见解可能与理解沸石破碎晶格或蒸汽处理沸石中的骨架外铝物种的催化有关,因为在这些地方可能存在这种配位不饱和的位点。

虽然该研究为氧化物负载金属中心上的C-H键活化机理提供了有价值的见解,但并未直接涉及工业应用或特定的氧化反应,如丁烷到顺丁烯二酸酐的转化。
