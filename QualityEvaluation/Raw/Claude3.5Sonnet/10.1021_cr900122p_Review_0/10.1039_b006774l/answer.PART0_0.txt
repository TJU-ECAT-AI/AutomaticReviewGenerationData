[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

[2] "The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

[3] "All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

[4] "Thus, the reaction mechanism consists of the insertion of aluminium into the CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration from Al to O, just as for hydrogen chemisorption."

The literature discusses how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum, on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involved is metal ion catalysis, rather than the Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms.

According to the calculations, the process occurs through:
1. Insertion of the aluminum into the C-H bond
2. Migration of the hydrogen from aluminum to an oxygen atom

This mechanism is different from what was previously thought for aluminum, which was expected to behave more like a Brønsted acid site. The study shows that coordinatively unsaturated aluminum sites (with 3 or 4 oxygen neighbors) can activate C-H bonds through metal ion catalysis, similar to how noble metals behave.

The literature does not specifically discuss the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, the insights about C-H activation by aluminum could potentially be applied to understand or improve such processes, as C-H activation is often a key step in selective oxidation reactions.

这篇文献讨论了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，如何促进非均相催化中的C-H键活化。涉及的机理是金属离子催化，而不是Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。

根据计算，该过程通过以下步骤进行：
1. 铝插入C-H键
2. 氢从铝迁移到氧原子

这种机理与之前对铝的认知不同，之前认为铝会更像布朗斯特酸位点。研究表明，配位不饱和的铝位点（具有3或4个氧邻居）可以通过金属离子催化活化C-H键，类似于贵金属的行为。

这篇文献并没有具体讨论烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。然而，关于铝活化C-H键的见解可能会被应用于理解或改进此类过程，因为C-H键活化通常是选择性氧化反应的关键步骤。
