[1] "Electron-correlated DFT calculations with a large basis set show that propane adds to coordinatively unsaturated aluminium, as in the clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0, 1), by aluminium insertion into a CH bond, followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom"

[2] "The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis), known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, was not considered for aluminium. We show now that Al(O)n sites with n = 3 and 4, are active in metal ion catalysis."

[3] "All chemisorption products react further to form hydrogen and propene, complexed with the aluminium cluster."

[4] "For the aluminiumalkyl pathway, eqn. (1), a primary CH bond (a) is more reactive than a secondary CH bond (b)."

The literature describes how isolated metal centers, specifically aluminum, on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis, where the coordinatively unsaturated aluminum inserts into a C-H bond of the alkane (in this case, propane), followed by hydrogen migration to an oxygen atom. This process is different from the previously assumed mechanisms involving hydron transfer or carbocation intermediates.

The study shows that both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites (Al(O)n with n = 3 and 4) are active in this metal ion catalysis. The aluminum-alkyl pathway is energetically favored over the oxygen-alkyl pathway. Primary C-H bonds are found to be more reactive than secondary C-H bonds in this process.

After the initial C-H activation, the chemisorption products further react to form hydrogen and an alkene (propene in this case), which remain complexed with the aluminum cluster. This suggests a dehydrogenation mechanism.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction, it presents a different mechanism for C-H activation that involves direct interaction with the metal center.

The document does not provide information on the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers could potentially be applied to improve understanding and design of catalysts for such processes.

文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是铝，如何在多相催化中促进C-H键的活化。该机制涉及金属离子催化，其中配位不饱和的铝插入烷烃（在本例中为丙烷）的C-H键中，随后氢迁移到氧原子上。这个过程与之前假设的涉及质子转移或碳正离子中间体的机制不同。

研究表明，三配位和四配位的铝位点（Al(O)n，其中n = 3和4）在这种金属离子催化中都是活性的。铝-烷基路径在能量上比氧-烷基路径更有利。在这个过程中，发现伯C-H键比仲C-H键更具反应性。

在初始C-H活化之后，化学吸附产物进一步反应形成氢气和烯烃（在本例中为丙烯），它们与铝簇保持络合状态。这表明存在一个脱氢机制。

虽然文献没有特别讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H-抽提，但它提出了一种不同的C-H活化机制，涉及与金属中心的直接相互作用。

该文档没有提供关于烷烃工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子的信息。然而，对孤立金属中心上C-H活化机制的见解可能有助于改进对此类过程的催化剂理解和设计。
