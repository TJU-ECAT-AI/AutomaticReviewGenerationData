[1] "Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

[2] "This type of catalytic mechanism follows what is known as a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis. It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

[3] "Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

[4] "For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Single electron abstraction: The Lewis acid metal center can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule, initiating oxidation.

2. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves cooperation between Lewis acid, Lewis base, and redox sites. The key steps are:
   - Substrate activation on a metallic cation
   - Insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens 
   - Redox process at the metallic site with electron transfer

3. Acid-base adduct formation: The Lewis acid forms adducts with either the substrate or oxidizing agent, enhancing reactivity.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This specific reaction occurs on the (1,0,0) face of vanadyl pyrophosphate crystals. The spatial arrangement of atoms on this crystal face facilitates interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane.

Other examples utilizing similar mechanisms include oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide.

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen insertion and metal redox cycling, is particularly important for many metal oxide catalysts in alkane oxidations. By controlling the acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface, selective oxidation of C-H bonds can be achieved industrially.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 单电子抽取：Lewis酸金属中心可以从富电子分子中抽取单个电子，从而启动氧化过程。

2. Mars van Krevelen机理：这涉及Lewis酸、Lewis碱和氧化还原位点之间的协同作用。关键步骤包括：
   - 在金属阳离子上活化底物
   - 从晶格氧插入氧原子
   - 在金属位点进行氧化还原过程，伴随电子转移

3. 酸碱加合物形成：Lewis酸与底物或氧化剂形成加合物，增强反应活性。

这些原理应用于烷烃的工业选择性氧化，例如丁烷转化为马来酸酐。这个特定反应发生在钒酰焦磷酸盐晶体的(1,0,0)面上。这个晶面上原子的空间排列有利于与丁烷的C-C和C-H键相互作用。

其他利用类似机制的例子包括在羟基磷酸盐上进行异丁酸的氧化脱氢生成甲基丙烯酸，以及在氧化镁负载的钒氧化物上进行丙烷脱氢生成丙烯。

Mars van Krevelen机理，涉及晶格氧插入和金属氧化还原循环，对许多金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化中特别重要。通过控制氧化物表面的酸碱性和氧化还原性质，可以在工业上实现C-H键的选择性氧化。
