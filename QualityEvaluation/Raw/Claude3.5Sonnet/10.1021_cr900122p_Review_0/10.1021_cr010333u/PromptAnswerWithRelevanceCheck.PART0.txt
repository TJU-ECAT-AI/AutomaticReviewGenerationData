[1] "It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

[2] "In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer."

[3] "Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

[4] "For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves a series of steps:
- Substrate activation on a metallic cation acting as a Lewis acid site
- Oxygen insertion from lattice oxygens 
- A redox process at the metallic site with electron transfer

2. Hydrogen abstraction occurs at basic surface O= or OH- species

3. The overall process involves substrate activation, hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer.

These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation of alkanes. A key example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride:

- This occurs on vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts
- The reaction takes place specifically on the (1,0,0) crystal face 
- The spatial arrangement of atoms on this face allows optimal interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane

Other industrial applications using similar principles include:
- Oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid
- Propane dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide

The use of isolated metal sites as Lewis acids, combined with basic oxygen species and redox-active metals, allows controlled activation and oxidation of alkane C-H bonds in these catalytic processes.

[1] "In these type of oxidations, the catalytic center is in reality an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle. This type of catalytic mechanism follows what is known as a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through a combination of Lewis acid, Lewis base, and redox sites. This follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, which involves several key steps:

1. Substrate activation on a metallic cation acting as a Lewis acid site
2. Oxygen insertion from lattice oxygens 
3. Redox process and electron transfer at the metallic site

The mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from the substrate, typically by surface O= or OH- species acting as Lewis bases. This is followed by oxygen insertion and electron transfer.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. In this process, the catalyst likely contains isolated metal centers that activate the C-H bonds in butane through the Mars van Krevelen mechanism. The metal centers cycle through different oxidation states as they abstract hydrogen from butane, insert lattice oxygen, and then are regenerated by gas phase oxygen.

Other examples that likely follow similar principles include the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide. In each case, the isolated metal centers and their surrounding oxygen environment work together to selectively oxidize the alkane substrate.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Lewis酸、Lewis碱和氧化还原位点的组合来促进多相催化中的C-H键活化。这遵循Mars van Krevelen机制，涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 在作为Lewis酸位点的金属阳离子上活化底物
2. 从晶格氧插入氧
3. 在金属位点进行氧化还原过程和电子转移

该机制涉及从底物中提取氢，通常由作为Lewis碱的表面O=或OH-物种完成。随后是氧的插入和电子转移。

这些原理应用于烷烃的工业选择性氧化。一个具体的例子是丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐。在这个过程中，催化剂可能含有孤立的金属中心，通过Mars van Krevelen机制活化丁烷中的C-H键。金属中心在从丁烷中抽取氢、插入晶格氧，然后被气相氧再生的过程中循环经过不同的氧化态。

其他可能遵循类似原理的例子包括在羟基磷酸盐上异丁酸氧化脱氢生成甲基丙烯酸，以及在氧化镁负载的钒氧化物上丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。在每种情况下，孤立的金属中心及其周围的氧环境共同作用，选择性地氧化烷烃底物。

[1] "Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

[2] "This type of catalytic mechanism follows what is known as a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Single electron abstraction: The Lewis acid metal center can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule, initiating oxidation.

2. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves cooperation between Lewis acid, Lewis base, and redox sites. The key steps are:
   - Substrate activation on a metallic cation
   - Insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens 
   - Redox process at the metallic site with electron transfer

3. Acid-base adduct formation: The Lewis acid forms adducts with either the substrate or oxidizing agent, enhancing reactivity.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, such as the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This specific reaction occurs on the (1,0,0) face of vanadyl pyrophosphate crystals. The spatial arrangement of atoms on this crystal face facilitates interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane.

Other examples utilizing similar mechanisms include oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide.

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism, involving lattice oxygen insertion and metal redox cycling, is particularly important for many metal oxide catalysts in alkane oxidations. By controlling the acid-base and redox properties of the oxide surface, selective oxidation of C-H bonds can be achieved industrially.

This process is thought to occur specifically on the (1,0,0) crystal face of the catalyst, where the spatial arrangement of atoms facilitates interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane. The metal centers activate the alkane, lattice oxygen is inserted, and the metal undergoes redox cycling to complete the catalytic process.

These principles allow for selective oxidation by controlling the reactivity through specific crystal faces and metal-oxygen arrangements in the catalyst structure. The combination of activation, oxygen insertion, and controlled electron transfer enables the transformation of butane to the more complex maleic anhydride molecule.
