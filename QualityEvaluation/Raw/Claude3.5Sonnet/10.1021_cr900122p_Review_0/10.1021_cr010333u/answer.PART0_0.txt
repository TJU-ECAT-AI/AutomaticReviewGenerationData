[1] "It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

[2] "In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer."

[3] "Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

[4] "For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. The Mars van Krevelen mechanism involves a series of steps:
- Substrate activation on a metallic cation acting as a Lewis acid site
- Oxygen insertion from lattice oxygens 
- A redox process at the metallic site with electron transfer

2. Hydrogen abstraction occurs at basic surface O= or OH- species

3. The overall process involves substrate activation, hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer.

These principles are applied industrially in selective oxidation of alkanes. A key example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride:

- This occurs on vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts
- The reaction takes place specifically on the (1,0,0) crystal face 
- The spatial arrangement of atoms on this face allows optimal interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane

Other industrial applications using similar principles include:
- Oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid
- Propane dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide

The use of isolated metal sites as Lewis acids, combined with basic oxygen species and redox-active metals, allows controlled activation and oxidation of alkane C-H bonds in these catalytic processes.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. Mars van Krevelen机理涉及一系列步骤：
- 在作为Lewis酸位点的金属阳离子上活化底物
- 从晶格氧中插入氧
- 在金属位点进行氧化还原过程并伴随电子转移

2. 氢抽提发生在碱性表面O=或OH-物种上

3. 整个过程涉及底物活化、氢抽提、氧插入和电子转移。

这些原理被应用于烷烃选择性氧化的工业生产中。一个关键例子是丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐：

- 这发生在钒焦磷酸盐催化剂上
- 反应特别发生在(1,0,0)晶面上
- 这个面上原子的空间排列允许与丁烷的C-C和C-H键进行最佳相互作用

使用类似原理的其他工业应用包括：
- 异丁酸氧化脱氢生成甲基丙烯酸
- 在氧化镁负载的钒氧化物上进行丙烷脱氢生成丙烯

在这些催化过程中，将孤立金属位点作为Lewis酸与碱性氧物种和氧化还原活性金属相结合，实现了对烷烃C-H键的可控活化和氧化。
