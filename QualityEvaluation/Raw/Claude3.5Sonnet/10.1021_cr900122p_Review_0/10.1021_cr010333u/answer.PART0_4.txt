[1] "Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

[2] "This type of catalytic mechanism follows what is known as a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism. 27-34"

[3] "It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

[4] "In the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Single electron abstraction: The Lewis acid metal center can abstract a single electron from electron-rich molecules, initiating oxidation.

2. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves an assembly of Lewis acid, Lewis base, and redox-active metal sites. The key steps are:
   - Substrate activation on the metal cation
   - Insertion of lattice oxygen 
   - Redox process at the metal site with electron transfer

3. Formation of acid-base adducts: The Lewis acid can form adducts with either the substrate or oxidizing agent, enhancing reactivity.

For industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, like butane to maleic anhydride, the Mars van Krevelen mechanism is commonly applied. This process is thought to occur specifically on the (1,0,0) crystal face of the catalyst, where the spatial arrangement of atoms facilitates interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane. The metal centers activate the alkane, lattice oxygen is inserted, and the metal undergoes redox cycling to complete the catalytic process.

These principles allow for selective oxidation by controlling the reactivity through specific crystal faces and metal-oxygen arrangements in the catalyst structure. The combination of activation, oxygen insertion, and controlled electron transfer enables the transformation of butane to the more complex maleic anhydride molecule.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 单电子抽取：Lewis酸性金属中心可以从富电子分子中抽取单个电子，从而启动氧化过程。

2. Mars van Krevelen机理：这涉及Lewis酸、Lewis碱和可进行氧化还原的金属位点的组合。关键步骤包括：
   - 底物在金属阳离子上的活化
   - 晶格氧的插入
   - 金属位点上的氧化还原过程和电子转移

3. 形成酸碱加合物：Lewis酸可以与底物或氧化剂形成加合物，增强反应活性。

对于工业上的烷烃选择性氧化，如丁烷到马来酸酐的转化，通常应用Mars van Krevelen机理。这个过程被认为主要发生在催化剂的(1,0,0)晶面上，其中原子的空间排列有利于与丁烷的C-C和C-H键相互作用。金属中心活化烷烃，晶格氧被插入，金属经历氧化还原循环以完成催化过程。

这些原理通过控制催化剂结构中特定晶面和金属-氧排列来实现选择性氧化。活化、氧插入和受控电子转移的结合使得丁烷能够转化为更复杂的马来酸酐分子。
