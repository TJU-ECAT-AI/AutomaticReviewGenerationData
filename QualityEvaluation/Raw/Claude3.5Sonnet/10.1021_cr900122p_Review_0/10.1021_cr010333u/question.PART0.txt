I. Introduction and Scope
This review is focused on the use of solid Lewis acids to promote catalytic oxidations. While the concept of using Lewis acids to promote the reaction of organic substrates with oxidizing reagents is widely accepted in homogeneous catalysis, this concept has not become evident and generally used in heterogeneous catalysis until recent days. Certainly the development of new Lewis acid solids active and selective for catalytic oxidations is an urgent need and a challenging scientific target for some substrates especially using environmentally friendly oxidants. Since the replacement of current stoichiometric oxidations for the production of fine chemicals by environmentally benign catalytic oxidations is one of the major tasks in green chemistry, solid Lewis acids are called to play a crucial role to accomplish this goal.
In the review, we will see the still important role that stoichiometric oxidations play in our daily life, and how they are being substituted by catalytic oxidations. At this point, three general mechanisms in which Lewis acids are involved will be described, and the material has been organized starting from homogeneous and ending with solid catalysts for heterogeneous oxidations. A bridge between the two will be established by presenting catalytic systems that can fill the gap between the two systems helping to rationalize the nature of the catalytic active sites in solid systems.
This review is obviously focused on solid oxidation catalysts, and the core of the review is organized to show the evolution from the simplest strategy for heterogeneizing homogeneous catalysts, i.e., supporting the active species on large surface area solids, to the more elaborate ones in which the active sites are part of the solid structure. Given the importance of metallosilicates, and more specifically titanosilicates, as catalysts in commercial processes, special attention has been paid to these types of materials.
Although sufficient references are provided to early seminal work, special emphasis has been given to most recent contributions to this area, particularly of the last 10 years. Patent literature has also been extensively covered in this review. Examples to illustrate the concepts have been selected among recent publications, and an effort has been made to present a series of commercial and near commercial processes based on catalytic oxidations. Finally, twoshort sections have been devoted to present how catalytic oxidations can be used to eliminate a series of pollutants, and how catalytic oxidations are present in our domestic life.
II. Oxidation Strategies
Since the beginning of the petrochemical industry, oxygen was the only possible oxidant that could be used in the production of bulk chemicals due to the huge production volumes and the economics of the processes. The higher added value of specialty chemicals allows the choice among other oxygen atom donors such as H2O2, alkyl hydroperoxides, and sodium hypochlorite.
Fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals are characterized by a much lower production volume and much higher added value. In addition, from the chemical point of view they encompass a wide diversity of chemical structures, often relatively complex and having concurrently different functional groups. This complicates enormously the transfer of a chemical process from the synthesis of a given fine chemical to a different one. In practice, the synthesis of each individual chemical is considered independently and surely requires a specific research and development to be implemented. Also, their high molecular weight and the presence of functional groups generally precludes performing oxidations in the gas phase and the processes for the production of fine chemicals have to be necessarily developed in the liquid phase, very frequently in a multipurpose batch reactor.
In the synthesis of fine chemicals, the chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of the oxidation reaction is the crucial issue. The wide diversity in structures, combined with the relatively low production volume and the need of selectivity, explains why innovation in these industrial oxidations did not become a priority.
Noncatalytic, stoichiometric oxidation using conventional oxidants are still in use for numerous processes involving the oxidative CC double bond cleavage, the transformation of primary and secondary alcohols into acid derivatives, aldehydes and ketones, heteroatom oxidation, oxidation at allylic and benzylic positions, etc. Stoichiometric oxidants are used in the production of a very wide number of pharmaceuticals, fragrances, agrochemicals, etc.; traditional oxidation methods involve the use of stoichiometric quantities of high oxidation state Cr, Mn, or Os reagents, among others. 1
Despite the important role still played by stoichiometric oxidations, the general trend is the development of catalytic processes to replace traditional stoichiometric oxidants such as dichromate, chromate, permanganate, manganese dioxide, osmium tetroxide, lead tetraacetate, etc. The need to develop alternative environmentally friendly catalytic oxidations derives not only from the nature and potential toxicity of the metal present in the stoichiometric oxidant, but also from the general principle of green chemistry to reduce the volume of byproducts formed in the overall synthetic route. In catalytic oxidations, the stoichiometric oxidants are molecular oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxide, persulfate, percarbonate, perborate, hypochlorite, etc., that do not release any metal ion as a byproduct in the process.
Two related examples in which an obsolete way to produce a chemical using a stoichiometric oxidant has been replaced by a catalytic oxidation are the preparation of hydroquinone from benzene and the production of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione) that is an intermediate for vitamin K. In the first case (Scheme 1), not only the number of steps has been reduced and the stoichiometric oxidant replaced, but also the ratio between the weight of byproducts to the final product in the overall synthesis was decreased from over 10 to less than one. 2,3
Scheme 1
In the production of menadione (Scheme 2), the conventional route using chromium trioxide in sulfuric acid formed 18 kg of inorganic salts. This process was substituted by catalytic oxidation using 60% aqueous hydrogen peroxide over palladium(II) exchanged polystyrenesulfonic acid resin. 4
Scheme 2
The fact that Lewis acid sites can catalyze oxidation reactions is not sufficiently recognized and exploited in heterogeneous catalysis. Very frequently, solids containing transition metals are termed as redox catalysts, but they act in reality as solid Lewis acids. It is well established that soluble Lewis acids can act as promoters of oxidation reactions, and sufficient examples of this will be provided in the corresponding section.
Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation.
The review has been organized by addressing each of these Lewis acid-catalyzed oxidation mechanisms in separate sections showing in each case the transition from homogeneous to heterogeneous catalysis.

III. Lewis Acids as Oxidation Catalysts
A. Oxidations by Single Electron Abstraction
Single electron transfer is in essence the most elementary oxidation in which oxidation is defined as a process in which a substrate losses electrons. Although electron abstraction by conventional Lewis acids is well documented, the location of the electron accepted by the Lewis acid cannot be frequently determined. The resulting organic radical cation is a highly reactive, short-lived reaction intermediate that can be subsequently trapped by water or any other nucleophile present in the medium or by oxygen, 5-7 and at the end oxygenated products are formed (Scheme 4). We will summarize briefly this type of process below.
Scheme 4
Benzene associates with strong Lewis acids such as antimmony pentafluoride or boron trifluoride in sulfur dioxide as a solvent. 8 The oxidation potential of benzene is lowered by this interaction, and the stronger the association with the Lewis acid the largest is the reduction of the potential. Values of 1.6 and 1.1 V have been determined for BF3 and SbF6, respectively.8 This decrease in the oxidation potential is responsible for benzene polymerization to form poly(p-phenylene) polymer.
AlCl3-doping can also serve to generate organic radical cations through electron abstraction from electron-rich substrates. Electron-rich aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds such as anthracene and thianthrene are readily converted into their corresponding radical cations by adding anhydrous AlCl3 in a polar, inert solvent such as liquid SO2.7 Analogously, quasi-monodimensional p-type semiconductors can be obtained by adding small amounts of AlCl3 into the hydrocarbon chain matrix of discotic liquid crystals such as those derived from hexahexyloxytriphenylene. 9,10
Lewis acid sites have been proposed to be responsible for the aerobic oxidation of polycyclic aromatic compounds adsorbed on silica and zeolites. For instance, tetracene gives rise to 5,12-tetracenequinone as the major product together with lesser amounts of 5,12-dihydroxytetracene and 5,12-dihydro-5,12-dihydroxytetracene following a first-order rate constant of 1 × 10-5 s-1. 11 Apparently, the reaction intermediates involved in this process are the corresponding radical cations of the electron rich aromatic generated through electron transfer from the arene to the Lewis acid sites.
Given the simplicity of the electron transfer generation of aromatic radical cations and their ability to react with molecular oxygen to form oxygenated products with high selectivity, it is surprising that these reactions have not yet been exploited in large-scale industrial processes. They will require only to have sufficiently high oxidation potential Lewis acid sites to generate the radical cation intermediate.
A practical scale for measuring the ability of the acid sites of a solid for the generation of radical cations versus truly acid behavior has been proposed based on the combination of reactant test molecules and quantification of the radical cation population by means of EPR spectroscopy. 12 1,4,5,8-Tetramethylnaphthalene undergoes a facile acid (either Brnsted or Lewis) rearrangement to 1,3,5,8-tetramethylnaphthalene and then to other tetramethylnaphthalene isomers. In contrast, the corresponding radical cation of 1,4,5,8-tetramethylnaphthalene is stable and does not undergo any rearrangement.12 By measuring the extent of methyl rearrangement and radical cation population, a scale of the capability of acid sites toward electron-transfer abstraction can be obtained for a series of oxidant-solvent combinations. This test reaction appears to be very useful to quantify acidity versus oxidation ability of Lewis acids and their applicability deserves to be demonstrated in other systems.
Lewis acids of zeolites are also known to generate organic radical cations. By combining an EPR study of the generated radical cations with MAS 27Al NMR spectra of dealuminated mordenite, a relationship between the presence of Lewis acid sites and the oxidizing ability of mordenite has been proposed. 13 Thus, the radical cation of 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene is characterized by EPR after adsorption of 2,5-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene or 2,5-dimethyl-3-hexene on dealuminated mordenite. The intensity of the signal correlates with the presence of extraframework Al. When extraframework Al is removed by mineral acid leaching or chelation with oxalic acid, only a very weak EPR signal was detected. Thus, it was proposed that although Brnsted acid sites may be responsible for the major catalytic activity of mordenite, its ability to abstract one electron to generate persistent radical cations relies on extraframework Al.13 Analogously, incorporation of α-pinene, trans-isolimonene, and α-terpinene in H-mordenite allows one to record the same EPR spectrum that was assigned to α-terpinene radical cation. 14 From the lack of deuterium labeling when α-pinene was adsorbed on deuterated mordenite, it was concluded that the rearrangement to α-terpinene is not catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, but most likely by Lewis acids which would be responsible for the single electron oxidation of the three terpenes.14
Vanadium(IV) and oxovanadium(IV) Schiff base complexes have been prepared and were found to exhibit catalytic activity toward the aerobic oxidation of p-phenylendiamine to the corresponding semi-oxidized radical cation form (Scheme 5). 15
Scheme 5
On the other hand, oxovanadium complex catalyzed oxygenation of disulfides is likewise facilitated by Lewis acids. It has been found that the activation of Lewis acids for the electron transfer to quinones and oxygenation with oxovanadium have in common a decrease in the oxidation potential of the diaryl disulfides, thus, facilitating their single electron oxidation. 16 It was found that catalytic amounts of Lewis acid (substrate/Lewis acid ratio 200) promotes polymerization of diaryl disulfides through a mechanism that involves the electron transfer from the diaryl disulfide to an equivalent amount of an oxidizing reagent such as p-benzoquinone.16 Compared to Brnsted acids such as trifluoracetic acid, SbCl5 and FeCl3 are over 200-fold more active to facilitate the electron transfer between diphenyl disulfide and p-benzoquinone in which linear poly(thio-1,4-phenylene) is formed.
Transition metal oxidative polymerization followed by concomitant doping of the resulting conjugated oligomer or polymer is sufficiently documented in the literature. 17,18 Doping of conjugated polymers increases enormously their electrical conductivity and is necessary in many of the potential applications of these materials. A procedure to obtain oligofurans with a high degree of conjugation and with an ordered aromatic structure consists of treating furan with FeCl3 as the oxidizing reagent in polar aprotic solvents, such as propionitrile. 19 The resulting oligomer is soluble in organic solvents and when blended with poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) a film with good mechanical resistance can be cast. The electrical conductivity of these films containing well-polymerized polyfuran after I2 doping is several orders of magnitude higher than that reported earlier for intractable polyfurans.19
Poly(2,5-furandiylvinylene) can be prepared by aldolic condensation of 5-methylfuran-2-carbaldehyde in a single step (Scheme 6). 20 This polyfurandiylvinylene can be doped with Lewis acids such as AsF5 and FeCl3 or iodine. The electric conductivity varies from 10-8 S cm-1 for the polyfuran to 10-2 S cm-1 for the AsF5 doped material.20
Scheme 6
Transition metals have been used to effect the chemical 21,22 or electrochemical polymerization 23 of pyrrole in water. FeCl3 is a general reagent to effect the polymerization of conducting polymers from five-member ring heterocycle monomers. 24 Polyaniline exhibiting a low polydispersity and high solubility in organic solvents can be obtained by oxidative polymerization with H2O2 using transition metal as catalysts. 25
Lewis acids such as metal chlorides oxidize the π electrons of conjugated polyene sequences formed in the dehydrochlorination of PVCs. 26 As result of this electron transfer, polarons of the incipient conjugated polymer are formed, which accelerate the chain mechanism of the dehydrochlorination. In contrast, organotin chlorides intercept the alkyl chains and produce the retardation of PVC dehydrochlorination.26 These processes are related to the degradation of PVC and the way in which it can be protected, and they have a considerable economic impact given the ample use of PVC.
The previous examples demonstrate that, in contrast to the general belief, Lewis acids can truly act as oxidation catalysts when the organic substrate has a sufficiently low oxidation potential and the corresponding radical cation is generated. In other cases, however, the reaction mechanism is more complex and the Lewis acid sites alone do not promote oxidation but they cooperate with other sites present in the catalyst. A classical example of this is the Mars and van Krevelen oxidation mechanism discussed in the next section.
B. Oxidations by an Assembly of Lewis Acid, Lewis Basic, and Redox Centers
In these type of oxidations, the catalytic center is in reality an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle. This type of catalytic mechanism follows what is known as a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism. 27-34
The structure at the atomic level of active sites of metallic oxides that catalyze oxidation reactions via Mars and van Krevelen mechanism has been recently reviewed.32 The structure, size, and relative strength of each of these individual sites, that conform the catalytic centers, are termed as inorganic oxide molecular clusters and define the overall activity and specifity of the bulk solid catalyst. The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis.31 It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons. In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer. Thus, the active sites require a spatial organization at atomic level and the cooperation of distinctive atoms.31 Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide. In the latter case, it is known that the overall activity of the catalysts depends on the basicity of the support and on the presence of isolated VOx sites. Water has been found to be necessary in some cases to provide hydroxylated surface sites allowing the reaction mechanism to operate.31
Several transition metal oxides and ions are active catalysts for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, and the catalytic activity can also be explained based on their acidbase properties. In this way, higher valent incompletely coordinated metal ions or anionic vacancies on oxide surfaces can act as acidic sites, and oxygen ions, O2-, as basic sites. The influence of the acidbase properties on the selectivity for hydrocarbon oxidations has been largely reported in the literature. 35-38
1. Vanadium-Based Systems
Vanadium is among the most active transition metals capable to effect alkane oxydehydrogenation, oxygenations, and alkylaromatic oxidations. In this regard, vanadium phosphates and aluminophosphates, as well as supported vanadium oxides, are widely used for this purpose. In the next two sections, we will comment on the catalytic activities of these vanadium-containing solids and the established relationship with Lewis acid sites.
a.Influence of the Acidity on the Catalytic Activity of Vanadium Phosphate. In agreement with the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, surface characterization techniques have provided some evidence in support of the presence of Lewis acid and basic sites during the operation of vanadyl phosphates as oxidation catalysts. Thus, high-resolution and in situ electron microscopy of vanadyl pyrophosphate after being reacted with n-butane or other reducing molecules has shown that the surface structure undergoes a significant modification during the catalytic process. 39 Two sets of symmetry related defects are created during the catalytic reaction. It is suggested that these defects are oxygen vacancies at sites linking corner-sharing phosphorus tetrahedra and vanadyl octahedra in the active plane.39 These vacancies create Lewis acid centers. It is proposed that these defect sites play a key role in the activation of the alkane, particularly for selective dehydrogenation reactions.39 Accordingly, this interpretation would indicate that oxygen atoms of the catalyst are consumed during the reaction.
For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane. 40
Vanadium phosphate catalysts have been modified by developing the (2.2.0) plane of VOHPO4·0.5H2O and introducing bismuth in its composition. The change in the surface characteristics by varying the P/V ratio results in an increase in the number of Lewis acid sites and the ionic strength of such sites, leading to an enhanced catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and an increased yield of ethylene. 41 Also ferric phosphate with and without Pd impregnation is active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid. During this reaction, amorphous FePO4 undergoes reduction to Fe2P2O7 at 300 C. The presence of palladium metal facilitates this reduction. 42
In some cases, acidity may play a negative role, as is the case for the selective catalytic oxidation of para-substituted toluenes to the corresponding benzaldehydes over vanadyl pyrophosphate. 43 Benzaldehyde adsorption on the catalyst surface largely facilitates deeper oxidation to aromatic carboxylic acids. Coadsorption of pyridine suppresses the strong aldehyde adsorption and improves benzaldehyde selectivity. Electron donating para-substituents favor the aldehyde adsorption on the catalyst and cause their total oxidation.43
Vanadium phosphate supported on TiO2 has been tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures between 300 and 400 C, showing satisfactory performances (80% selectivity to propene at 2% propane conversion at 300 C, and 56% propene selectivity at 9% propane conversion at 400 C). Addition of water or pyridine to the feed decreases propane conversion but increases propene selectivity. 44
Vanadium phosphate and other vanadia-supported solids are also catalysts for the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. It is under discussion whether this reaction requires the presence of one or more vanadium sites. By means of in situ Raman spectroscopy, it has been proposed that the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is more efficient at sites with more than one vanadium atom. 45 A recent mechanistic investigation of n-butane oxidation using 13C-labeled butane has been interpreted, however, assuming that the two methyl groups bind to a single vanadium atom through a cyclic organometallic intermediate. 46 An industrial process for the butane oxidation to maleic anhydride (Alusuisse Italia-Lummus Crest maleic anhydride or ALMA) based on the use of unsupported (VO)2P2O7 in a fluidized bed reactor has been reported. 47
In situ Raman spectroscopy as well as low-temperature CO adsorption monitored by IR suggests that the reversible oxidation and reduction between vanadyl pyrophosphate and a phase of vanadyl phosphate operates on the surface during the selective oxidation of n-butane exhibiting a relatively high selectivity toward maleic anhydride. 48
In general, the influence of metal dopants and promoters on vanadium phosphates are discussed in terms of the Lewis acidity that they introduce in the solid. Thus, the influence of a series of promoters (Nb, Si, Ti, V, Zr, Cr) for the n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride over bulk vanadium phosphorus oxide has been compared with that occurring on supported vanadia. 49-51 It was concluded that in both cases the catalysts requires the simultaneous presence of surface redox and acid sites and that the acidity also plays a role controlling further kinetic steps of n-butane oxidation. In this way, a correlation between maleic anhydride selectivity and the Lewis acidity of the promoter cations and oxide support in the case of supported vanadia has been found.50
It has been found that niobium phosphate acts as promoter for the vanadyl pyrophosphate oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. 52 Apparently, (NbO)PO4 is isostructural to α-(VO)PO4 both having a tetragonal structure, while the resulting mixed phosphate maintains the oxidizing capability of (VO)2P2O7 together with a strong Lewis acidity introduced by Nb.52
Characterization of the surface acidity of vanadiumphosphorus oxide catalysts with XRD pattern of vanadyl pyrophosphate has been undertaken using ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile as basic probes monitoring by IR spectroscopy. 53 The stronger bases detected the presence of both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites, whose ratio increased with the temperature indicating that Brnsted centers are stronger than the Lewis sites. A study of the use of these mixed oxides as catalysts for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride revealed that the yield of anhydride and the proportion of the strongest Lewis acid sites increases with time on stream, thus suggesting a relationship between both.53
In another study, the adsorption of ammonia on the surface of vanadyl pyrophosphate 54 used as catalyst for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile has been monitored by IR spectroscopy. Ammonia is adsorbed on Brnsted and Lewis acids sites. At room temperature, ammonia forms mainly ammonium, but increasing the temperature up to 400 C results in a progressive increase in the proportion of ammonia coordinated to surface Lewis sites.54 The presence of gaseous oxygen lowers the amount of coordinated ammonia, probably due to the formation of amido NH2 species. Propylene is adsorbed as a π-complex to the vanadium Lewis acid sites and in the absence of oxygen is transformed into acrylonitrile through the intermediacy of propylamine. On the other hand, propane does not form detectable adsorbates in the absence of oxygen, but in its presence the formation of acrylate is observed.54 This observation has led to the conclusion that two alternative pathways of acrylonitrile formation from propane operate in vanadyl pyrophosphate. The first in anaerobic conditions goes through propylamine, and the second, when oxygen is present, involves the reaction of acrylate and chemisorbed ammonia species, the latter pathway being much more rapid than the first.
b.Influence of the Acidity on the Catalytic Activity of Supported Vanadium Oxides. Supported vanadium oxides are among the most important heterogeneous catalysts for the vapor-phase oxidation of alkylaromatics, alcohols, and alkenes. 55-58 It is well-known in this type of catalysts that the nature of the metal oxide support plays an important role modulating the nature of V species and the catalytic behavior for oxidation reactions. Vanadium dispersion (related to the loading and the nature of the support) and acidity of the catalyst are the main factors to be considered. 59-61 A correlation between the isoelectric point (acidbase character) of the support and the photoluminescence of VO groups has been recently found. 62 Acidity also plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of the supported vanadium oxide. 63
Kinetics and mechanistic studies of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a series of vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides supported on zirconia have led to the suggestion that the rate determining step is the CH bond activation using lattice O atoms (basic sites). 64 The activation energy of this step depends on the identity of the cation and increases in the order VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies are higher than those for propene combustion, but the relative rates of these reactions most probably also depends on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane. The latter parameter is mainly influenced by the Lewis acidity of the cations through π bonding with the CC double bond. This explains the observed difference in activation energy between propane oxidative dehydrogenation and propene combustion, that increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).64
Potassium doping has a beneficial influence on the selectivity of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the oxydehydrogenation of butanes. 65 Apparently, addition of potassium results in a higher dispersion of vanadium species on the alumina support. This together with the presence of small amounts of K2O clusters leads to a decrease in the amount of exposed Al3+ Lewis acid sites and a lower redox ability of vanadium species.65
For all the supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadium loading is a parameter of paramount importance in the catalytic activity of the solid. As the vanadium loading increases, aggregation occurs, thus, varying the nature of the vanadium species and their catalytic properties. For instance, for the catalytic behavior of δ-alumina-supported vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane, it has been observed that the activity for dehydrogenation increases as the vanadium loading, while the selectivity toward alkene formation reaches a maximum at 34 wt %. 66 Apparently, the highest propene yields require of a solid containing redox sites of adequate potential combined with strong Lewis acid sites and mild basic sites.66 These findings seem to be in agreement with the operation of a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism, that requires the combination of these three type of sites.
Likewise, the selectivity of a series of catalysts based on vanadia supported on metal oxides toward the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride as a function of the loading shows that while the overall turnover number for butane oxidation is independent of the surface coverage of vanadium oxide, the selectivity toward maleic anhydride increases by a factor of 23 as the vanadium oxide coverage increases approaching monolayer coverage. 67 These observations were interpreted as indicating that n-butane oxidation only requires a single site, while formation of maleic anhydride requires the cooperation of a pair of vanadium sites. On the other hand, the metal oxide support influences both n-butane oxidation and maleic selectivity in a different way. It was found a correlation between the Lewis acid strength of the oxide support and the maleic anhydride selectivity.67
Divanadium pentoxide has been dispersed on a series of oxide supports including SiO2, TiO2, SnO2, TiO2/SiO2, MoO3/SiO2, and SnO2/SiO2 and the activity of the resulting solids as catalysts studied for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. 68 The activity of these catalysts was also a function of the surface coverage. At very low conversions, formaldehyde selectivity increases linearly with the surface coverage, indicating that isolated V(V) species are responsible for the catalytic effect. In the case of V2O5 supported on SiO2, the selectivity reaches a maximum at 1%, and the decrease in the selectivity at higher coverages was explained as derived from an increase in the Lewis acid strength of the solid.40
The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide can be promoted by Lewis acid assistance of the support as, for instance, in alkane oxidation. Thus, studies of the structure and reactivity of group V metal oxides have been carried out by means of methanol adsorption and oxidation. 69 It has been found that the active sites present in pure V2O5 are primarily redox sites and the active sites in pure Nb2O5 are essentially acidic in nature. Furthermore, the surface redox sites present in pure V2O5 are orders of magnitude more active than the surface acid sites in pure Nb2O5 and consequently the catalytic activity of V2O5/Nb2O5 mixed oxides is largely dominated by the vanadia component.69 However, niobia presence enhances significantly the activity of vanadia for those catalytic reactions that require a dual nature of redox and acid sites. This is the case of butane oxidation to maleic anhydride and the selective oxidation of ammonia by NOx.
In some cases such as magnesium meta-, ortho-, and pyrovanadates, the relative low activity toward alkane oxydehydrogenation as compared to other vanadia-supported selective oxidation catalysts such as V2O5/TiO2 and (VO)2P2O7 has been attributed to the basic environment generated by the MgO support, which causes a parallel decrease of the Lewis acidity influencing the oxidizing power of the active V ions. 70
On the contrary, the activity of Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox supported on δ-alumina, titania, silica, niobia, and zirconia for the direct conversion of propane to acrolein has been found to increase as the amount of Lewis acid sites surrounding the redox active VOx species present on the solid increases. 71
Although vanadium ions present on vanadium oxide act generally as redox sites, when supported on zirconia and titania they act as well as Lewis acid sites strong enough to form π complexes with toluene and m-xylene as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. 72 The methyl group of these π complexes becomes activated and undergoes hydrogen abstraction by the VO group leading to benzylic species and benzaldehyde.72 On the other hand, phenol is adsorbed through the oxygen atom and the phenyl ring is oriented perpendicular to the solid surface. Benzene is adsorbed forming mono and dimeric species.72
Lateral chain oxidation of alkylaromatics is an industrial process of paramount importance that can be also catalyzed by vanadium oxides. 73 Acidity also seems to play a role in this process, facilitating the oxidation. V2O7/TiO2 doped with K, Ba, Bi, W, and Sn oxides or carbonates exhibits catalytic activity in the oxidation of ortho-xylene to phthalic anhydride. At reaction temperatures higher than 370 C, good correlation between the strength of the acid sites and phthalic anhydride yield (K < Ba < Bi < unpromoted < W  Sn) was observed. 74 A restructuring of the catalyst, resulting in higher V/Ti surface ratios, occurs during the use of V2O7/TiO2 in o-xylene oxidation without any change in the crystallinity, the crystal size, or the +5 oxidation state of the V ions.74
In the heterocyclic version of the alkylaromatic oxidation, picoline can be directly oxidized with excellent yields (98%) by O2 in the gas-phase to nicotinic acid in the presence of V2O5-impregnated TiO2 (Scheme 7). 75 The latter catalyst contains Brnsted acid sites in addition to redox centers.
Scheme 7
Propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile can be catalyzed by vanadiumantimony mixed oxides. 76 The use of these solids in propane ammoxidation causes the surface +V oxidation state to approach +IV and diminishes the vanadium surface enrichment. This is due to the aggregation of V species and the decrease in the surface density of V oxide. 77
Mixed NiCrV, MgCrV, and NiAlV oxides have been prepared by thermal decomposition of layered precursors of hydrotalcite structure at temperatures between 300 or 500 C. 78 Surface acidity of the resulting solids was studied by means of the FT-IR monitoring of pyridine adsorption and correlated with the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol to acetone at 300 C. It was found that this oxidation occurs more extensively on Cr-containing mixed oxides due to the lack of Brnsted acidity and the exclusive presence of Lewis acid sites.78 The results have been correlated again with the operation of the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism.
In general, it can be summarized from the above two sections that vanadium phosphates and supported vanadium oxide are the solids of choice for alkane oxydehydrogenation and oxygenation in the gas phase. However, for oxidations in the liquid phase there is a considerable leaching of vanadium species from the solid to the solution. These dissolved vanadium species are responsible for most of the catalytic activity observed in solution. Attention has to be paid when trying to detect the leached vanadium species, since after cooling the reaction mixture, they can redeposit on the solid that will act as a reservoir for soluble catalytically active species.
This lack of catalyst stability of vanadium-containing solid will be also commented on in the next sections and is the reason that despite the inherent activity of vanadium for catalytic oxidations, the use vanadium-containing solids has not been expanded to liquid-phase reactions. Although vanadium is by far the most important transition metal for hydrocarbon oxygenations, many other metal oxides have also been used as oxidation catalysts, and this will be discussed in the next section.
2. Metal Oxides Other than Vanadium
Compared to zirconia, sulfated zirconia exhibits also oxidizing properties giving rise to the formation of phenol and trimethylphosphane oxide by adsorption of benzene and trimethylphosphane, respectively. 79-81 These two oxidative processes are something that is not observed for sulfate-free zirconia.81 The reaction mechanism has been firmly correlated to the intermediacy of radical cations generated through electron transfer from the organic compound to sulfated zirconia. EPR spectroscopy provides some evidence suggesting the formation of SO3•- radical anion during the oxidation of trimethylphosphane oxide.80,81
Analogously to sulfate, it has been found that the addition of just a small amount of chromium oxide (1 wt % Cr) to zirconia increases remarkably both the number and strength of the acid sites. 82 Characterization indicates the presence of both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites on the surface of CrOx/ZrO2 and that the oxidation state of Cr can change reversibly between Cr(VI) and Cr(III).82
Supported metal catalysts are widely used for the partial oxidation of alkanes or alcohols. The catalytic effects are not only due to changes in the metal dispersity but also to the interaction of the metal with the Lewis acid sites of the support. Experimental evidence indicates that the support and modifiers or promoters play a pronounced influence on the oxidation state of the metal atoms, ions, or partly charged clusters. Some additives exert an electron seeking effect on the metal surface state, stabilizing ionic states and increasing the effective charge of the metal ions, favoring their fast reduction during the catalytic cycle. For instance, while platinum deposited on alumina forms a platinum compound on the solid surface, the weaker electron acceptor properties of charcoal compared to alumina determines that the species present on charcoal surface is predominantly metallic platinum. 83
The active oxidation states of supported metal catalysts, such as Cu, Ag, and Au can be discussed by IR spectroscopy, UVVis spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, EXAFS, and electron microscopy. Comparison of the catalytic and the spectroscopic data reveals that metal cations are the active sites of the metal catalyst surface in alcohol oxidation. 84
High temperature methanol chemisorption and in-situ IR spectroscopy have been used to determine quantitatively the number of active sites available for methanol oxidation in bulk mixed metal molybdates. 85,86 It was found that Mo atoms are the sites in which methanol are bound and that the activity of the mixed metal molybdates decreases with the increase in the accompanying cation electronegativity due to electronic variations on the metalOMo bonds. The same effect is observed for supported metal oxides.85,86
Diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy has been used to investigate the influence of the solid composition and treatment on the population and relative proportion of Brnsted/Lewis acid sites of silicaalumina supported Mo oxide catalysts. 87 It was found that the ratio Brnsted-to-Lewis acid population increases with the SiO2 content of the support reaching a maximum for silicaalumina 75:25 or for alumina-rich supports this ratio also increases with the MoO3 loading.87 Analogously, EPR spectroscopy supports that Ce(IV) ions not fully coordinated are responsible for the Lewis acidity of ceria and CeO2 supported on silica. 88 The matrix influences the cerium distribution and the electron-acceptor redox properties of coordinatively unsaturated Ce(IV) ions.88
IR titration using pyridine as base has shown that silica-, alumina-, and zirconia-supported tantalum oxide are considerably more Lewis acidic than analogous vanadia-supported oxides.63 Spectroscopic characterization reveals that there may be two different tantalum species present on the surface. Distorted tetrahedral TaO4, having a TaO tripodally bound to the solid surface through three single TaO bonds and octahedral TaO6. The former predominates at low coverages. The activity of supported tantalum oxide has been studied as catalyst for methanol oxidation and their performance compared to vanadia.63
The activity and stability of solid catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming depend on the formation of carbon deposits due to methane decomposition into C and H2. 89 This carbon deposited on a metal site can be reoxidized to CO by oxygen coming from the dissociation of adsorbed CO2. For noble metals, this oxidation of deposited carbon is fast, leading to low carbon accumulation on the metal particles.89 What is remarkable is that the rate of carbon formation from methane was proportional to the concentration of Lewis acids. Thus, the combination of Pt with a support with a low Lewis acidity such as ZrO2 was found more suitable for long stability of the catalysts. For nonnoble metals such as Ni, the rate of methane dissociation exceeds the rate of carbon reoxidation to CO, and carbon deposits develop rapidly in the form of filaments. The rate of carbon filament formation was proportional to the Ni particle size and may be interesting for the production of carbon nanotubes. 90,91 Thus, in order for these solids to act as efficient catalysts, it is necessary to reduce the particle size below a critical particle size value (d < 2 nm). Well dispersed Ni supported on ZrO2 is a viable alternative to noble metal-based catalysts for methane-CO2 reforming.89
Partial oxidation of propane to syngas has been carried out in a flow reactor using as catalyst nickel oxide supported on alumina, magnesia, and silica. 92 Alumina-supported NiO was found the most suitable catalyst. Modification of these catalysts by alkali metal oxides or rare-earth oxide reduces the strength of the Lewis acid sites, and by decreasing the carbon deposition increases the stability and lifetime of the catalyst during propane partial oxidation.92
In the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons under mild conditions, the solid oxide catalysts can be viewed as a reagent that is regenerated after each redox cycle.40 New reactor design like transported bed and membrane reactors have been developed based explicitly on this principle.40
In this context, it has been reported that alkali metal doping of transition metal oxides endowed the oxides with the ability to convert CH4 to ethane and ethene. Thus, nickel oxide doped with lithium was an active catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane. On the basis of XRD analysis, it has been proposed that LiNiO2 is the actual solid catalyst. According to eq 1, methane would react to form C-2 products and water with the lattice oxygens of LiNiO2. These structural oxygens would be in turn regenerated by molecular oxygen (eq 1). 93
The influence of the nature of a metal oxide among Ca, Sm, and Yb in mixed oxides with zirconia in equimolar amounts has been studied for the oxidative coupling of methane. The activity of the catalysts is proportional to the specific surface area of the mixed oxide, while the selectivity toward C2 hydrocarbons increases in the series CaO < Sm2O3 < Yb2O3. 94 Characterization has revealed that the solids do not have Brnsted acid sites, but there are three different types of Lewis acid sites. The total concentration of these Lewis sites however follows the reverse order found for the selectivity of these mixed oxides toward the oxidative methane coupling to C2.94
The applicability of surface science techniques to obtain insights on the mechanism of heterogeneous reactions catalyzed by metal oxides has been exemplified in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene catalyzed by iron oxide. 95 The information provided by surface science techniques in ultrahigh vacuum has been combined with batch reactor measurements at high pressure.95 Ethylbenzene and styrene adsorb on regular terrace sites with their phenyl rings oriented parallel to the surface. The π electron cloud of the aromatic rings interact with the Lewis acidic atoms on the surface. Atomic defects are identified as catalytically active sites. A complete mechanistic description of the process at the atomic level is proposed in which the upward tilted ethyl group of flat adsorbed ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated at Brnsted basic oxygens located at defects.
The conversion of methane into methyl formate with high molar yields (>12%) has been attained by a two reactor system. In the first one, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde is accomplished at 600700 C on SiO2. Subsequently, formaldehyde is dimerized to methyl formate through a Cannizzaro disproportionation at 130170 C on various metal oxides, including titania, silica, zirconia, and sulfated zirconia. 96
Partial oxidation by oxygen of methanol to formaldehyde has been studied over SiO2- or MoO3-supported ferric oxide in supercritical CO2 at 90 bar. 97 Formaldehyde selectivity was found to depend on the percentage of iron on the support, the nature of the support, and the reaction temperature. Compared to silica, molybdenum oxide as support favors the formation of formaldehyde. This higher selectivity is related to the formation of iron molybdate as the active catalytic phase. FT-IR data indicate that the first step in all reaction processes is the generation of adsorbed iron-methoxy species.97 Molybdena supported on titania prepared from aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate and titania or by mechanical mixing of both oxides is also very active for the partial oxidation of methanol. 98
Fine-tuning of the Lewis acid/base properties of the surface pairs has been proposed as the important factor to control the activity and selectivity for the oxidative coupling of methane using solid solutions of rare earth and bismuth oxides. 99 From the catalytic tests in fixed-bed flow reactors, it has been found that the activity toward C2 products increases with catalyst basicity, while an increase in the Lewis acidity of the Bi cation leads to an enhancement of the ethene selectivity.99
Solgel chemistry using metallic complexes as precursors has been used to prepare FeAl mixed oxide exhibiting activity as catalyst for the liquid-phase cumene oxidation. It has been proposed that the mixed oxide acts as a bifunctional catalyst containing Lewis acid sites and terminal O centers. 100 As mentioned for the case of supported vanadium oxides as catalysts for liquid-phase reactions, the possibility of metal leaching and subsequent homogeneous phase catalysis by the leached metal should be addressed in this type of catalyst.
Likewise, heterogeneization of cobalt atoms by simple coprecipitation in the formation of silica gels using Co(OAc)2 has been reported to be effective for the side chain oxidation of alkylaromatic using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant. Diffuse reflectance UVVis and IR spectra of the solid seem to support the presence of tetrahedral Co(II) (detached from acetate anions) in the silica framework. 101
Ozone and several of its 18O-labeled isotopomers have been adsorbed on metal oxides such as silica, titania, zirconia, magnesia, and ceria at liquid N2 temperature. 102 Ozone behaves as a weak basic molecule and interacts with surface hydroxyl groups. With weak Lewis acid sites, ozone molecules form coordination adducts via a terminal oxygen atom, with stronger Lewis acid sites (such as titania, alumina, and zinc oxide) no evidence of a Lewis adduct is obtained. Apparently, ozone dissociates on these sites generating highly reactive oxygen atoms. These oxygen atoms can participate in the catalytic oxidation of CO on oxide surfaces. 103
An IR study of adsorbed CO, NH3, C3H6, C3D6, and C3H6-O2 on oxidized and reduced samples of mixed titaniumantimony oxide showed that both oxidized and reduced solids contain basic sites, but lack of strong Lewis acid centers. 104 Interaction of propene occurs through the CH bond of the methyl group with the basic sites.104
Chromium(III) oxide is able to catalyze the disproportionation of chlorodifluoromethane. This reaction can be useful to prepare commercially important fluorinated methanes and apparently takes place on coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. 105
Several solids have been developed for the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions exhibiting the typical advantages with respect to homogeneous catalysts, like easy handling and workup and recycling. A review discussing the use of amorphous metallic oxides and zeolites, particularly Beta and silicalite as catalysts for the MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction has recently appeared. 106 Amorphous metallic oxides and zeolites that exhibit surface basicity or Lewis acidity are generally the solids used as catalysts for this type of disproportionation.
Layered clays have been extensively used as acid catalysts and as supports for oxidants (clayfen and claycop) and Lewis acids (clayzic). 107-110 Hydrogen cyanide has been proposed as a probe of the Brnsted and Lewis nature of the acid sites in metal-oxide pillared clays. 111 Upon exposure of metal oxide-pillared clay to saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, a decrease in the density of sites that interact with HCN is observed by IR spectroscopy.111 The outcome of this study based on the HCN probe is that while the metal oxide pillars are responsible for the Lewis acidity, the Brnsted acid sites are located on the clay sheets. A third type of site appears in the pillar fixation process. These distinctive sites associated to the pillaring process are most affected by the nature of the pillar and may exhibit selectivity to interact with a hydrocarbon. For example, zirconium oxide pillared hectorite interacts most effectively with benzene or toluene than n-hexane or cyclohexane.111
A natural bentonite pillared with aluminum, aluminumiron, and aluminumruthenium polyoxocations has been further ion exchanged with iron. 112 All these solids were active materials for the catalytic transformation of propene into acetone at temperatures between 150 and 350 C.112 The reaction proceed via acid-catalyzed propene hydration followed by dehydrogenation of 2-propanol to acetone. Accordingly, the activity of the solids correlates with the nature and population of the redox and acid sites.112
K10-montmorillonite and 4A molecular sieves catalyze the oxidation of secondary benzylic alcohols by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in good yield and selectivity, except when an electron-donating group is present in the 4-position of the phenyl ring. 113 The reaction mechanism was assumed to involve an Oppenauer-type oxidation. Using zeolite 13X as catalyst, a very enhanced activity was observed and interpreted as reflecting the fact that the reactants can be accommodated inside the zeolite cavities. However, besides the fast formation of carbonylic compounds, other competitive side reactions take place lowering the resulting selectivity.113
C. Oxidations via Lewis AcidBase Adducts
The third general way in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions is by forming an acidbase adduct either with the substrate or with the oxidizing reagent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation (see chapter II and Scheme 8). A typical example is the olefin epoxidation by titanium-containing zeolites that will be discussed latter. In this type of mechanism, the metal atom does not undergo variation in its oxidation state and the catalysis occurs because tetracoordinated titanium atoms bind to the hydroperoxide and enhance the electrophilicity of this oxidant. Thus, while TS-1 was initially described as a redox catalyst, it is now being increasingly recognized simply as a Lewis acid solid. 114
Scheme 8
Comparison of the oxidation rates using as substrate a sulfide and the corresponding sulfoxide can be used to distinguish the electrophilic or nucleophilic nature of the catalytically relevant active species (Scheme 9). Thianthrene oxide has been proposed as a probe molecule for this purpose (Scheme 10). 115,116 This type of study allows one to gain insight into the oxygen atom insertion process (either electrophilic or nucleophilic) and on the role and optimum structure of the catalyst. Thus, for instance, similar reaction rates have been measured for the oxidation of methyl p-tolyl sulfide and the corresponding sulfoxide by cumyl peroxide using titanium(IV)-(R,R,R)-tris(2-phenylethoxy)amine as catalyst. 117 Such behavior stands in contrast with the remarkably high selectivity exhibited by d0 transition metal peroxo complexes. This has led to the conclusion that the alkylperoxo complex formed by the attack of the cumyl hydroperoxide to the titanium catalyst is the actual catalytic species. This alkylperoxo displays a biphilic nature, behaving as electrophilic oxidant toward the sulfide and nucleophilic oxidant when it reacts with the sulfoxide. Theoretical calculations (RHF/3-21G*) and kinetic evidence indicate that the Lewis acidity of the Ti(IV) metal center activates the hydroperoxide and the sulfoxide in a template intramolecular process.117
Scheme 9
Scheme 10
All Lewis acid catalysts active in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons contain transition metal cation of d0 or d10 configuration. The interaction of weakly basic unsaturated hydrocarbons with transition metal ions has been considered as weak base (hydrocarbon)strong acid (d0 cations), or weak base (hydrocarbon)weak acid (d10 cations) interactions. 118-120 Taking this into account, the selectivity of the oxidation will depend on the activity of the transition metal and decreases in the order indicated in Scheme 11.118
Scheme 11
It appears then that the adsorption and activation of hydrocarbons in oxidation processes can be regarded as acidbase interactions. 121 In this sense, a too strong adsorption of hydrocarbon on the oxidation acid sites will result in a too long contact time on the surface with the corresponding loss of selectivity. The hallmark of these Lewis acid catalyzed oxidations is that the oxidation state of the metallic ion does not change during the catalytic cycle. This occurs typically in catalytic oxidations that follow a mechanism in which the oxygen transfer occurs via peroxometallic intermediates: 122,123 Transition metals that react through peroxometalic species are Ti, Zr, Mo, and W.
With respect to the oxidating agents, the production of bulk products involves the use of air or oxygen. However, when the added value of the product increases, then other oxidants with a higher cost can be used. In Table 1 different oxidants are presented together with the active oxygen content and the corresponding byproduct formed.

In this following section, we will show the logical evolution from homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts, supporting them on solid supports and finally developing an efficient isotropic solid Lewis acid catalyst containg framework transition metals.
1. Oxidations in Homogeneous Phase
There are plenty of examples in which Lewis acids catalyze oxidation reactions by coordinating either with the substrate (increasing its electron deficiency) or with the oxidizing reagent (enhancing its electrophilicity). The catalysis occurs truly through an acid/base mechanism. However, since the outcome of the reaction is the oxidation of a substrate, some misleading rationalization can describe these Lewis acids as redox catalysts. This misconception has been particularly frequent when the catalyst is a solid Lewis acid. The following examples in homogeneous phase have been selected to illustrate that Lewis acid assistance of oxidation reactions is very well established in solution.
a.Use of Conventional Lewis Acids. A Japanese patent describes the preparation of 2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone, an intermediate in the synthesis of vitamin E, 124 by catalytic oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate or sulfuric acid using methyl ethyl ketone as solvent (Scheme 12).124
Scheme 12
It has been found that the presence of just a few equivalents of Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride or aluminum trichloride accelerates considerably the room-temperature oxidation of alkanes with chromate or permanganate. 125 In this context, cyclohexane can be oxidized at room temperature by barium ferrate, 126 permanganate,125 chromate125 in a mixture of acetic acid and dichloromethane giving a product distribution containing cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, and cyclohexyl chloride. The reaction requires the presence of a Lewis acid. Among the series of Lewis acids tested, the oxidation rate follows the order AlCl3 > FeCl3 >MgCl2 > LiCl > ZnCl2. This system is also able to oxidize ethane and propane to give mixtures of chloroalkanes and carbonylic compounds. It was proposed that in the case of ferrate the active intermediate is the Lewis acid adduct formed by coordination of an oxo ligand of the ferrate to the Lewis metal center. This adduct initiates the oxidation by abstracting one hydrogen atom from the alkane and generating a carbon-centered radical. Also barium ruthenate in acetic acid-dichloromethane oxidizes alkanes at room temperature with appreciable rates and yields, the reaction being remarkably accelerated by the presence of a few equivalents of Lewis acids. 127
The BaeyerVilliger oxidation transforms aldehydes into carboxylic acids or ketones into esters by reaction with carboxylic peracids. Despite the availability of carbonylic compounds, the potential of the BaeyerVilliger reaction in organic synthesis remains underdeveloped due to the lack of chemoselectivity when other functional groups, particularly CC double bonds, are also present in the molecule. The development of catalytic versions of the BaeyerVilliger can help to overcome the limitation of poor selectivity. An example of asymmetric BaeyerVilliger reaction for the formation of β-substituted γ-butyrolactones based on the concept of chiral auxiliary has been reported. 128 The process consists of using an enantiomerically pure acetal as the starting material for the BaeyerVilliger oxidation. The acetal is prepared from the achiral 3-substituted cyclobutanone and enantiomerically pure 2,5-pentanediol. Oxidation is carried out at low temperatures (78 C) using m-chloroperbenzoic acid assisted with SnCl4 as catalyst (Scheme 13).128
Scheme 13
The oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides by permanganate in anhydrous acetone solutions has been shown to be catalyzed by Lewis acid such as FeCl3, ZnCl2, and HgCl2. 129 The kinetics unequivocally confirm that the function of the Lewis acid is to activate the oxidant by forming a permanganate/Lewis acid adduct analogous to the protonation of MnO4- by Brnsted acids. A Hammett analysis of the reaction rate constant in a series of substituted thioanisoles gives a negative ρ value, indicating an electron deficient transition state. All the kinetic data including secondary kinetic isotopic effect and sulfide/sulfoxide competitive oxidation are consistent with a mechanism in which the oxidant and the reductant react via initial ligation.129
Sodium and silver bromates (NaBrO3 and AgBrO3) are stoichiometric oxidizing reagents in organic solvents for a variety of organic functional groups provided that the oxidation is assisted by Lewis acid catalysts. Among the compounds that can be oxidized are alcohols, acyloins, hydroquinones, and aldehydes. Primary benzylic CH are oxidized to aromatic carboxylic acids, while secondary CH are oxidized to ketones. 130 A heterogeneous version of this process uses Amberlite IRA-400 supported bromate, and the system has the advantage of being regenerated. 131
An analogous bromate reagent is benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromate, prepared by ion metathesis from benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride with sodium bromate. 132 The quaternary phosphonium counteranion renders bromate more soluble in organic solvents. This oxidizing reagent is thermally stable and in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts can be utilized to oxidize efficiently in organic aprotic solvents. This bromate salt converts benzylic alcohols, cycloalcanols, and hydroxyketones into the corresponding carbonyl compounds in good yields and thiols to disulfides in moderate yields.132
Benzyltriphenylphosphonium periodate has been prepared in the same way as the corresponding bromate and exhibits a parallel behavior. Its use as oxidant reagent also requires the assistance of a Lewis acid. 133 Thus, for instance, aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride etherate are active catalysts for the oxidation by tetrabutylammonium periodate of a series of organic compounds such as alcohols to carbonyl compounds, α-hydroxyketones to diketones, and α-hydroxycarboxylic acids to carbonyl compounds after decarboxylation, thiols to disulfide, and thioethers to sulfoxides. 134
Primary and secondary benzylic and saturated trimethylsilyl ethers are efficiently converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with silver bromate assisted by AlCl3. 135p-Hydroquinone trimethylsilyl ether is also converted to p-benzoquinone with either AgBrO3/AlCl3 or with NaBrO3/AlCl3. AgBrO3/AlCl3 is able to oxidize primary trimethylsilyl ethers to their carboxylic acids. Primary and secondary benzylic trimethylsilyl ethers are also converted to their carbonyl compounds with NaBrO3/AlCl3. AgBrO3 is more efficient and selective than NaBrO3.130
Thiophenes treated with m-chloroperbenzoic and boron trifluoride etherate form S-monoxide intermediates that undergo in situ cycloaddition with dienophiles to give the corresponding cycloadducts. 136 The presence of the Lewis acid enhances considerably the yield of the oxidative cycloaddition. Moreover, a larger number of dienophiles react with thiophene S-oxide giving cycloaddition when the Lewis acid is present.136
FeCl3-promoted oxidative coupling of methoxyarenes to form the corresponding biaryls is significantly enhanced in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of AlCl3, whereby yields between 28 and 85% with excellent selectivity are obtained (Scheme 14). 137
Scheme 14
Primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols and aromatic lateral chains can be air oxidized using N-hydroxyphthalimide and Lewis acids such as BF3 as cocatalysts. 138 The role of the Lewis acids is to weaken the OH bond of the hydroxylimide through hydrogen bond formation, favoring the homolytic OH bond breaking. The oxidation occurs through a chain reaction mechanism initiated by the nitroxyl radical derived from the hydroxyphthalimide.138
From the previous examples, it can be concluded that the phenomenon of the assistance of oxidation reactions by conventional Lewis acids (AlCl3, BF3, etc.) is quite general and well established in liquid phase. We will follow showing that transition metals behaving as Lewis acids are also homogeneous oxidation catalysts.
b. Use of Soluble Transition Metals and Transition Metal Complexes. Transition metal ions are also Lewis acids that can bind to oxidizing reagents and in this way catalyze oxidation reactions.
Hydroperoxides are widely used as environmentally acceptable oxidizing reagents. In the presence of an aqueous carbonate solution as buffer, simple manganese(II) salts, such as MnSO4, catalyze alkene epoxidations. 139 The epoxidations are carried out at room temperature by dissolving the alkene and manganese salt in dimethylformamide or tert-butyl alcohol and slowly adding 30% H2O2 and 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate buffer. Among the obvious advantages of this homogeneous epoxidation process, besides the use of hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing reagent, the major one is the use of an inexpensive and off-the-shelf available catalyst that does not contain or require sophisticated organic ligands. Since bicarbonate is a necessary additive, it is proposed that the reaction mechanism involves the intermediacy of hydrogen percarbonate as the active oxidant.139 Obviously, despite its simplicity the drawback of this homogeneous process is the impossibility to recycle the catalyst and the production of manganese byproducts in the oxidation, although in substoichiometric amounts.
Electron-rich aromatic compounds can be brominated with KBr and H2O2 using V2O5, Mo7(NH4)6O24, or NH4VO3 as catalysts. 140 Reexamination of this reaction has shown that the process consumes stoichiometric amounts of an acid such as sulfuric acid. The system NaBr or KBr, diluted mineral acid (HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, or H3PO4) and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of divanadium pentoxide has been proposed as an alternative to other bromination reagents. 141
Lower alkanes such as methane can be catalytically oxidized into esters in the liquid phase using a media that combines very strong acidity and oxidation activity such as sulfuric acid using stable Pt-2,2-bipyrimidine complexes as catalysts and tellerium or antimony salts as cocatalysts. 142
Aqueous solutions of transition metals can catalyze aerial oxidation of substrates in a different phase. Thus, isomerized kerosenegas oil fraction at 170 C under pressure in the presence of an aqueous solution of transition metal carboxylates, particularly cobalt(II), undergoes oxidation to high-purity succinic acid that crystallizes from the aqueous solution. 143
Lateral chain oxidation of alkylaromatics to aromatic carboxylic acids is an industrial oxidation of huge economic importance that can be effected by transition metal catalyzed oxidation using oxygen as oxidant. Thus, a process for the manufacture of benzoic acid and its salts in which a quaternary ammonium bromide facilitates the oxidation of toluene has been reported. 144 In this process, the quaternary ammonium ion acts as phase transfer catalyst and the oxidation occurs at about 150 C and high pressure of oxygen (1215 atm) in the presence of catalytic amounts of a transition metal salt such as CoCl2 dissolved in water.144 Terephthalic acid can also be obtained through liquid-phase oxidation of p-phenylene compounds catalyzed by transition metal compounds. 145
2,6-Diisopropyl- and related 2,6-dialkylnaphthalenes can be oxidized by air oxygen under pressure in a batchwise manner using a mixture of Cu(OAc)2, Mn(OAc)2, and KBr as catalyst and acetic acid as solvent to form 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid with high yields. 146 Likewise, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid was also prepared by oxidation of 1,4-dialkylnaphthalenes with oxygen using as catalyst a solution of transition metal in acetic acid. 147 1,4-Naphthalenedicarboxylic acid is an important starting material for the production of polyesters.
The target in the vast majority of oxidations using organic hydroperoxides is to obtain a valuable oxidized product, hydroperoxides being considered as reagent. An exception to this is the case of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide formed in large scale quantities in the oxidation of cyclohexane with oxygen. To process cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, it has been proposed the use of cyclohexene soluble transition metal compounds to catalyze the epoxidation of cyclohexene. Subsequently, the resulting cyclohexene oxide is reduced to cyclohexanol or transformed to other valuable cyclohexane derived product. 148
A process to obtain highly pure 1,1-dialkyl-4,4-bipyridinium salts from 1-alkylpyridinium ions consists of the coupling of the latter in the presence of alkali cyanide 149 in aqueous methanol, followed by removing the cyanide ion as a divalent transition metal cyanide. Colloidal or supported Cu(II) and Fe(III) hydroxides catalyze at room temperature in aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions the oxidation of catechol to muconic acid and benzene to phenol. 150
In the classical MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction, a carbonylic compound becomes reduced using 2-propanol as solvent and reducing agent in the presence of aluminum isopropoxide as catalyst (Scheme 15). 151 Alkali metal alkoxides are inefficient to promote this formal hydride transfer. The same reaction, but now considered as the selective oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, is known as the Oppenauer oxidation. Quantitative information about the equilibrium of a given MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reaction can be obtained from thermodynamic data.
Scheme 15
The reaction mechanism of the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions has been reviewed. 152 Mechanistically, the MeerweinPonndorf VerleyOppenauer reaction is an example of an oxidation or reduction equilibrium that is catalyzed by a Lewis acid. These processes are related to the Cannizzaro disporportionation since the key step is a hydride transfer from a donor to an acceptor. In the case of the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer, the reaction generally proceeds through a six-membered transition state in which both reductant and oxidant are coordinated to the metal center of a metal alkoxide catalyst. In aluminum-catalyzed reactions, ligand exchange is always the rate determining step, and it can be so slow that it precludes the use of aluminum alkoxides in catalytic amounts.
More promising as homogeneous MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer catalysts are lanthanide, zirconium, or hafnium complexes, which combine strong Lewis acid character and good ligand exchangeability. In lanthanide-catalyzed reactions, the ligand exchange is much faster and the reaction rate is dominated either by ligand exchange or by the hydride transfer step.
The catalytic activity of lanthanide isopropoxides increases in the order La < Nd < Gd  Er  Yb, which follows the sequence of metal ion size, indicating that the Lewis acidity of the lanthanide catalysts is the major factor in the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions. 153 Metal alkoxide catalysts can be prepared from the metal halides by alcoholysis.152 High enantioselective MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reduction in which the catalyst was a chiral lanthanide(III) alkoxide has been reported.152
The Oppenauer oxidation is a useful method to transform secondary alcohols into ketones. However, it is in general difficult to apply this reaction to convert primary alcohols into aldehydes. It has been found that bis(pentafluorophenyl)borinic acid at a catalyst/substrate ratio between 1 and 2 mol % is a suitable catalyst to oxidize secondary as well as primary allylic and benzylic alcohols to the corresponding ketones or aldehydes (Scheme 16). 154 Pivalaldehyde was used as hydride acceptor and magnesium sulfate was present as drying agent. The reaction was performed at room temperature. Apparently, the stronger Lewis acidity of perfluorinated diarylborinic acid compared to analogous pentafluorophenylboronic is the most important factor responsible for the catalytic activity of the former compounds.154
Scheme 16
A water-soluble [Ir(COD)Cl]2 catalyst (COD: cycloctadiene) in combination with 2,2-biquinoline-4,4-dicarboxylate has been found highly efficient for the selective Oppenauer oxidation of secondary benzylic and aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding ketones at a catalyst/substrate ratios ranging between 0.4 and 2.5%. 155
Methyl trioxorhenium has been found a robust catalyst to effect epoxidations and alcohol oxidations using hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing reagents. 156-159 Because of its Brnsted acidity, the addition of pyridine and its derivatives can have a positive effect, trapping hydronium ions that may be produced in the reaction with MeReO3. It has been observed that the binding constant of pyridines and methyltrioxothenium is governed by electronic and steric effects. For instance, the binding constant of parent pyridine is 200 L mol-1, whereas that of a better electron donor 4-picoline is 730 L mol-1 and that of sterically encumbered 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine is lower than 1 L mol-1. 160 Pyridine stabilizes the MeReO3/H2O2 system by decreasing the steady-state concentration of free MeReO3. The presence of these nitrogen heterocycles considerably reduces the rate of epoxide ring opening having a beneficial influence in the selectivity of the alkene epoxidation catalyzed by MeReO3.160 Thus, pyridine accelerates the rate of epoxidation of α-methylstyrene, while avoiding the problems derived from the acidity of MeReO3.
Methyltrioxorhenium at 1 mol % is able to catalyze the selective oxidation of electron-rich aromatic compounds to the corresponding quinones using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and a mixture of acetic acid and anhydride as solvent.159 Apparently, the anhydride acts as dehydrating agent during the reaction avoiding the interference of the water that is formed as product. As an example, 2-methylnaphthalene is oxidized at 60 C to give 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone with 87% conversion and 92% selectivity (Scheme 17).159
Scheme 17
Alkenes can be oxidized into the corresponding carboxylic acids via bond cleavage by H2O2 using methyltrioxorhenium and HBF4 as cocatalyst.158
Cyclopentadienyl trioxorhenium is able to effect the stoichiometric oxidative rearrangement of the ring in a series of alkyl substituted cyclopropenes. 161 The reaction mechanism has been rationalized in terms of an initial alkenemetal interaction, followed by formation and fragmentation of a metallaoxetane. In contrast, phenyl substituted cyclopropenes rearrange in the presence of cyclopentadienyl trioxorhenium to indenes, a process that is catalytic from the point of view of the rhenium and based on the behavior of other Lewis acids is explained in terms of a Lewis acid-catalyzed reaction.161 Obviously, the problem inherent to the use of soluble rhenium compounds as oxidation catalysts is that despite their remarkable activity they cannot be reused.
The study of the effect of bidentate ligands on the olefin epoxidation using molybdenum oxobisperoxo complexes L-LMoO(O2)2 has served to establish the relationship between the Lewis acidity and the catalytic activity for epoxidation. This relationship supports an epoxidation mechanism in which the peroxo complex activates the oxidizing agent, either H2O2 or ROOH, rather than directly transferring an oxygen atom from the peroxo ligand to the olefin. 162 Proton transfer is one of critical points in the catalytic activity of such complexes in olefin epoxidation. NMR studies of proton transfer from strong Brnsted and Lewis acid to L-LMoO(O2)2 proves that protons are transferred preferentially to the 2-peroxo and not to the oxo ligand. 163
Cerium ammonium nitrate is an strong oxidizing reagent that can effect the stoichiometric oxidation of alkylaromatics to benzylic alcohols and nitrates and primary alcohols to aldehydes. 164,165 Cerium ammonium nitrate can even oxidize methanol. The stoichiometry of the process indicates the concurrent formation of protons during the methanol oxidation. It is believed that these protons are responsible of the cerium ammonium nitrate-catalyzed methanolysis of allylic and benzylic alcohols. 166 This reaction can also be catalyzed equally well by other Lewis acids, thus, reinforcing the assumption that cerium ions intervene as Lewis acids in this alcoholysis.166
Benzyl esters are formed catalytically at moderate temperatures from alkyl benzenes using sodium bromate as oxidant and cerium ammonium nitrate as catalyst in a carboxylic acid as solvent. 167 Thus, toluene gives benzyl acetate in acetic acid. Ethylbenzene, cumene, 4-tert-butyltoluene, and 4-bromotoluene behave similarly. Xylenes undergoes a selective monoacetoxylation. The cerium salts not only promote the oxidation, but they also act as a Lewis acids that catalyze the conversion of benzyl bromides into the benzyl esters.
Metallic complexes with achiral or chiral ligands are widely used as homogeneous oxidation catalysts. Remarkable examples in terms of selectivity have been reported, the problem being always the impossibility of catalyst recovering and reuse in homogeneous phase. In the following, we will comment on some examples of complexes in the homogeneous phase in which acidity has been found to play a role in catalytic oxidations.
Fluorination of 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1-binaphthyl increases the electrophilic character of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or cumyl hydroperoxide coordinated titanium center in the sulfide oxidation to sulfoxide. 168 Surprisingly, under identical conditions, the titanium-catalyzed sulfide oxidation using 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1-binaphthyl or its 5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8-octafluoro derivative of the same absolute configuration leads to opposite sense of chiral induction.168
Binuclear Fe(III) complexes derived from N,N,N,N-tetrasubstituted 1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol having N-(2-pyridylmethyl) or N-2-benzimidazolylmethyl substituents exhibit a high reactivity as catalysts for the reaction of phenol and 2-deoxyribose with hydrogen peroxide. The active oxidizing species possesses an electrophilic character. It was proposed that the Lewis acidity of Fe(III), and the steric hindrance imposed by the ligand play a role in the reaction mechanism. 169
Aimed at the search of a reaction for the efficient fixation of CO2, a new catalytic system using chromium(III) bis(salicylaldimine) as catalyst and 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine as cocatalyst has been reported. 170 The process gives high yields of cyclic carbonates from the coupling of epoxides and CO2 at 50 psig pressure (Scheme 18). A variety of terminal epoxides including aliphatic and aromatic and epichlorhydrin affords the corresponding carbonates in near quantitative yield and complete selectivity. The catalyst is air stable, maintains its activity over a long reaction time, and does not require any solvent.170
Scheme 18
Soluble titanium alkoxides can act as homogeneous epoxidation catalysts in various solvents. 171-173 For instance, homogeneous phase catalytic epoxidation of cyclooctene to form cyclooctene oxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide has been reported in supercritical CO2 using supercritical CO2-soluble Ti(OCHMe2)4 as catalyst. 174 Following the work of Sharpless and Katsuki on the enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols using chiral titanium complexes of diethyl tartrate, 175-178 Jacobsen and Katsuki reported a series of chiral Mn (III) complexes with Schiff bases as enantioselective epoxidation catalysts for alkenes. 179-181
In this enantioselective catalytic epoxidation of olefins by alkyl hydroperoxides or other related oxidizing agents, optically active oxo(salen)manganese(V) complexes are the key reaction intermediate in the oxygen atom insertion step. At temperatures below 78 C, the oxygen atom insertion ability of this oxo(salen)manganese species is suppressed and, under these conditions, they act exclusively as chiral Lewis acid catalysts for the Diels Alder cycloaddition of cyclopentene with α-bromoacrolein, giving the corresponding cycloadduct in 68% enantiomeric excess and with high exo selectivity (Scheme 19). 182
Scheme 19
A case of highly chemoselective oxidation of allylic alcohols to enones has been reported as a function of the (salen)Cr(III) counteranion using iodosobenzene as oxidant. 183 When Cl- is the (salen)Cr+ counteranion the chemoselectivity to enones is excellent, while for triflate and hexafluorophosphate nearly equal amounts of enone and the epoxy alcohol are obtained. This influence of the counteranion on the oxidation of allylic alcohols mediated by (salen)Cr+ complexes has been rationalized in terms of Lewis acid catalysis by the complex when Cl- is the counterion and redox catalysis in the case of CF3SO3- and PF6-.183
A review has recently appeared in which the ability of biomimetic metal complexes of Co(II), Fe(II), and Mn(II) derived from open chain N2O22- and macrocyclic N42- Schiff base ligands to bind and activate dioxygen has been discussed. 184 Oxygen binding has been correlated with the activity of these complexes to catalyze the oxidation of hydroquinone by O2. In general, catalytic activity is only observed for those complexes that are able to bind oxygen at the central metal atom in the +II oxidation state, although the observed differences in activity could not be rationalized by differences in the oxidation potentials and/or Lewis acidity of the central metal ions. Iron and manganese complexes with some special peripheral substituents reduce dioxygen completely to oxide giving oxygenated oxo derivatives.184
By means of sterically encumbered tris(pyrazolyl)borate as ligand, the way in which cobalt complexes activates dioxygen has been found. Initially, a peroxo dimer is formed that gives rise to the oxocobalt complex. Other oxidants such as N2O forms the hydroxycobalt active species. 185
Metalated porphyrins have been used as catalysts for the degradation of lignin in wood or pulp, hydroxylation of (cyclo)alkanes, and epoxidation of alkenes by TBHP 186 or iodosobenzene. 187 The use of perchlorinated porphyrins increases the stability of these compounds as catalysts. 188,189
The oxo transfer ability from the nitro ligand to alkenes using (nitro)(pyridyl)cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin has been investigated as a function of the apical pyridine ligand either 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine or 3,5-dichloropyridine. 190 Very modest differences were observed for hexacoordinated complexes, while oxo transfer occurs rapidly through the pentacoordinated species (nitro)cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin generated by dissociation of the pyridine ligand in the hexacoordinate complex. Pentacoordinated (nitro)cobalt(III) tetraphenylporphyrin can oxidize allyl bromide in minutes. This pentacoordinated (nitro)cobalt(III) with enhanced activity is more easily generated using weaker Lewis base pyridines such as 3,5-dichloropyridine. Mechanistic studies indicate that the oxo transfer process involves both radical and nonradical pathways.190
A supramolecular structure in which a manganese porphyrin having two peripheral pyridine rings spontaneously assembles inside a large cavity formed by four zinc porphyrins tied together by chlorotricarbonylrhenium has been reported to act as epoxidation catalyst. 191,192 The system behaves like an artificial enzyme since a catalytically active metalloporphyrin is encapsulated inside a cavity that protects the active center and defines the size and shape of the accessible reagents. The manganese porphyrin increases its lifetime under reaction conditions from 10 min for the same bare complex to more than 3 h upon encapsulation. Pure manganese porphyrin loses its activity after 50 cycles, but the supramolecular structure reaches turnover numbers as high as 21000. The selectivity of the catalyst can be tuned by adding up to two ligands which change the size of the cavity, allowing significant differentiation between substrates.191 These results nicely illustrate how the stability and selectivity of metallo complexes can be increased by incorporation into a well-defined supramolecular structure.
The same authors had previously reported that several manganese(III) porphyrins show significantly increased turnover numbers for the catalytic epoxidation of styrene upon addition of zinc and magnesium tetraphenylporphyrins. 193-195 For manganese porphyrin bearing two pyridyl substituents, 24-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity was measured. As in the case commented on earlier for the superstructure of manganese porphyrin encapsulated in the cavity defined by zinc porphyrins, this increase in the catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of a coordination trimer (metal ion other than manganese coordinated to the two peripheral pyridyl groups). This trimer would provide steric protection to the active oxomanganate intermediate avoiding bimolecular decomposition. In agreement with this hypothesis, in the absence of coordinating pyridyl moieties on the manganese porphyrin, less significant enhancement is observed.193
The redox potentials for reversible oxidation to the corresponding oxovanadium(V) cations (0.35 V vs SCE in dichloromethane) and irreversible reduction waves (in the range of 1.9 to 2.1 V vs SCE) have been measured by means of cyclic voltammetry for the oxovanadium(IV) complex of substituted dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene ligands. 196 From a preparative point of view, the oxovanadium(V) complex can also be obtained by oxidation of the oxovanadium(IV) complex with ferricenium hexafluoroantimonate, while unstable anionic oxovanadium(IV) complex was obtained by reducing the complex with sodium/potassium metal alloys.196
Zirconium complexes of chiral aminodithiolate ligands act as catalyst for the enantioselective oxidation of geraniol with TBHP with 46% ee. 197 The same complex exhibits also Lewis acidity in the nitroaldol reaction with modest 30% enantioselectivity.197
The above examples show that transition metal salts and their complexes are Lewis acids that can act as highly active and selective oxidation catalysts through formation of acidbase adducts.
2. Oxidations in Biphasic Fluorous Systems
In the direction of development of catalytic oxidations in which the catalyst can be recovered and reused, one strategy is to use two immiscible liquid phases. An example of this approach is the biphasic fluorous system.
In the biphasic fluorous system, there is a perfluorinated organic solvent such as perfluoroalkanes that is not miscible at ambient temperature with most frequent organic solvents such as alkanes, ethers, or alcohols. 198-205 Upon heating of the sample at the reaction temperature, the system becomes homogeneous since miscibility of the two liquids increases considerably. Once the reaction has taken place, upon cooling the two liquid phases separate again, the catalyst remaining dissolved in the fluorous phase and the nonfluorinated solvent containing the reaction mixture. Scheme 20 summarizes the successive steps in a catalytic reaction based on fluorous system.
Scheme 20
Besides the temperature-dependent miscibility of the two solvents, the key point of this strategy resides in the fact that the catalyst has to be very soluble in the perfluorinated solvent while the products are not. Since perfluorinated liquids are bad solvents (particularly compared with the polychlorinated analogues), the reaction products are generally not soluble in the perfluorinated liquid, but the first condition (exclusive solubility of the catalyst in the fluorous phase) normally requires the adequate functionalization of the catalyst. In this functionalization, a perfluorinated skeleton or perfluorinated tag is introduced in the molecule. This is normally accomplished through extensive and dedicated synthesis of the catalyst. This synthetic work and the limited number of catalysts that are suitable to be modified by introducing fluorinated pony tails constitute the main drawbacks of the biphasic fluorous strategy. In addition, the fluorinated solvents are very expensive and their availability at industrial scale is limited.
Biphasic fluorous systems have been widely used to effect oxidation reactions. Molecular oxygen is the oxidant of choice in most of the reported examples, although ozone can be used equally well. 206,207 This is mainly due to the high solubility of molecular oxygen in perfluorohydrocarbons. This makes oxidation processes in fluorinated solvents very attractive in terms of the use of oxygen as terminal oxidant and the possibility of catalyst recycle. 208 Several oxidation types including epoxidations, alcohol oxidation, and BaeyerVilliger reactions have been carried out in fluorous solvents.
Readily available n-butyl 2,4-di(n-perfluorooctyl)phenyl selenide catalyzes the epoxidation of various olefins with H2O2 in a fluorous biphasic system. 209 The catalyst is selectively soluble in perfluorinated solvents, and can easily be separated, recovered, and reused several times without noticeable decrease in the final yield.209 Alkenes can also be transformed into the corresponding ketones using TBHP in the presence of Pd(II) having perfluorinated ligands using benzene and bromoperfluorooctane as biphasic system. 210 Chiral (salen)manganese(III) complexes have been employed for the asymmetric epoxidation of indene with enantiomeric excesses up to 90%. 211 Compared to the use of oxygen as oxidant on biphasic fluorous systems, it seems that H2O2 or alkyl hydroperoxides are less advantageous.
Pd(OAc)2 catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes and ketones in the presence of catalytic amounts of novel perfluoralkylated pyridine as ligand in a biphasic fluorous system composed of toluene and perfluorodecalin. 212 The fluorous phase containing the active Pd species is easily separated and can be reused several times without loss of activity. This catalytic system is applicable to benzylic and aliphatic alcohols.212 A catalytic system containing 4,4-bis(perfluorooctyl)-2,2-bipyridine (2 mol %), CuBr2-(CH3)2S (2 mol %) and TEMPO (3.5 mol %) has been also reported to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes and ketones in a biphasic fluorous system of chlorobenzene and perfluorooctane directly with O2. 213 The catalytic mixture can be reused four consecutive runs without observable loss in activity.
Cobalt(II) complexes of perfluorinated porphyrins and phthalocyanines have been used as catalysts for the oxidation of alkyl aryl sulfides with pivaldehyde/O2 in biphasic fluorous systems (Scheme 21). 214 Sulfoxide is preferentially formed, together with variable quantities of sulfone. Cobalt perfluorophthalocyanines were found less efficient in terms of substrate conversion, but afford sulfoxides selectively.214 The recycling of the catalyst was partly ineffectual owing to their partial degradation, particularly in the case of phthalocyanine complexes.
Scheme 21
It is obvious that biphasic fluorous systems are interesting since they allow recycling and reuse of the catalyst. However, the major drawback is the need of dedicated synthetic efforts to make the catalysts soluble in perfluorinated solvents. The use of these expensive fluorinated solvents is also a limitation, particularly for large scale applications.
3. Heteropolyacids as Oxidation Catalysts
Polyoxometalates and heteropolyacids are obtained by the condensation of two or more different types of oxoanions (eq 2). In these compounds, the anion contains a central atom, typically Si or P, tetrahedrically coordinated to oxygens and surrounded by 218 oxygen-linked hexavalent peripheral transition metals. 215-220 These are usually Mo or W, but it can also be others, such as Nb, Ta, U, either single or in combination. The most common structure in catalysis is the Keggin type heteropolyacid (XM12O40)n-, one specific example being the 12-tungstophosphoric acid.
Heteropolyacids are mainly Brnsted acids. Given the large size of the polyanion having a low charge density delocalized through the surface, the interaction between the polyoxometalate anion and the compensating proton is weak and consequently they are strongly acidic. However, the interconversion between two oxidation states of the transition metal atoms or Lewis acid interaction renders these molecules or corresponding anions also oxidation catalysts.
Product distribution (propene or acetone) upon 2-propanol adsorption and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine has been proposed as a test reaction to titrate the Brnsted and Lewis acid sites of commercial phosphomolybdic acid (Brnsted plus Lewis sites) or n-hexylammonium phosphomolybdate (exclusively Lewis sites) supported on silica. 221 Preferential propene formation over acetone, i.e., larger dehydration selectivity versus dehydrogenation, indicates a stronger surface acidity.
Polyoxometalates and phosphotungstates have been reported to act as catalysts for the direct formation of N-alkylacetamides and alkyl halides from adamantane, cyclohexane, and cyclooctane by reactiving them in acetonitrile or in halogenated solvents, respectively (Scheme 22). 222 It has also been found active to effect the catalytic conversion of highly toxic mustard gas bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide into the nontoxic sulfoxides using TBHP in the presence of polyoxovanadate as catalyst. 223
Scheme 22
The oxidation of isobutane to methacrolein and methacrylic acid has been carried out over potassium/ammonium salts of phosphomolybdic acid of the Keggin-type with an overall selectivity to the desired products higher than 50%. 224 The presence of iron in the heteropolyacid composition led to a substantial enhancement of the catalytic activity with an increase of the desired products, even though the selectivity decreased.224 Also pyridine treatment at 420 C under N2 flow promotes an enhanced catalytic activity for isobutane and propane oxidation with molecular oxygen to methacrylic and acrylic acids, respectively. 225 The deeper the pyridine treatment is, the higher the oxidation activity and selectivity to partial oxidation products. FTIR reveals that pyridinium ions remain adsorbed in the lattice of heat-treated H3PMo12O40/pyridine, while on the surface Lewis acid sites are created due to oxygen vacancy defects in the Keggin structure.225 On the basis of the above findings, it is proposed that the mechanism of alkane oxidation over H3PMo12O40 involves acidity and electrons to activate O2.
In an attempt to render the catalytic oxidations with polyoxometalates heterogeneous, these compounds have been supported on large surface area inorganic oxides.
Oxidation of propene to acetone has been studied over silica and alumina supported molybdophosphoric acid catalysts at 190 C in the presence of water. 226 This overall process can be taken as the coupling of propene hydration and the oxydehydrogenation of 2-propanol, and, thus, the active catalysts must combine both acid and redox sites.226 FT-Raman characterization of the catalysts shows that molybdophosphoric acid adsorbed on SiO2 retains its Keggin structure while when supported on alumina it decomposes to MoO3. H3PMo12O40/SiO2 showed almost no activity, while MoO3/Al2O3 exhibits fairly good activity despite the stronger acid sites of the former. From this study, it was concluded that the rate-limiting step should be hydrogen abstraction on isopropoxy groups adsorbed on the catalyst surface.226
Heteropolytungstates have been immobilized by anion exchange with quaternary ammonium modified silica 227 and polysiloxane 228 or Amberlite IRA-900 resins.229 Unfortunately, leaching of metal occurs, diminishing the interest of these electrostatically immobilized polyoxometales as heterogeneous oxidation catalysts.
Heteropolyacids having a defect structure incorporating a transition metal can catalyze the oxidation of alkylaromatics with molecular oxygen to aromatic carboxylic acids in acid media.230 Analogously, oxidation of alkylarenes to the corresponding carboxylic acids or aromatic aldehydes by oxygen can be performed using a mixture of heteropolyacid and a transition metal complex dissolved in water.231 Thus, a mixture of ruthenium acetylacetonate and phosphotungstic acid is effective for the oxidation of p-xylene with oxygen (60 kg m2) at 200 C in an autoclave.231
The decomposition of cumene peroxide into phenol and acetone, a process of paramount industrial importance, has been reported to proceed at temperatures between 30 and 60 C in a batchwise procedure over supported heteropolyacid catalysts. The support for this process is a montmorillonite previously activated by H2SO4 treatment or metal ion (Zn, Fe, La, and Ce) impregnation.232 Dodecatungstophosphoric acid exhibits 100% conversion within 5 min at 30 C with complete selectivity. Correlation of the catalytic activity with acidity has revealed that both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites promote efficiently the decomposition.
As it will also be commented on later in the section devoted to permanganate, the pulp and paper industry is one of the industrial processes that consumes higher amounts of oxidants. A method to effect the oxidative degradation of soluble lignin and polysaccharide fragments dissolved during polyoxometalate delignification of pulps and fibers with oxygen has been reported. 233-235 This procedure to degrade oxidatively soluble lignin to volatile organic compounds can be catalyzed by a series of polyoxometalates of different compositions and stoichiometry, an example being H5(PV2Mo10O40).234 It has been found that during the process the polyoxometalate undergoes a one-electron reduction by the electron-rich phenolic residues of lignin, which degrade through a consecutive series of sequential single-electron oxidations, first to cyclohexadienyl radicals and subsequently to cyclohexadienyl cations. The latter cationic intermediates would degrade by lateral chain cleavage. 236 The catalytic cycle is closed upon reoxidation of the reduced polyoxometalate form by oxygen.
Laser excitation of solid catalysts in the near-IR region can stimulate methane partial oxidation. 237 On the solid surface of PW12O403- heteropolyanions, there exist Lewis basic sites located at WO and WOW oxygens as well as Lewis acid sites at W6+ cations. Methane is adsorbed by interacting with the Lewis basic sites, preferentially with WO groups. Laser excitation at 980 cm-1 of the WO groups stimulates the oxidation of methane to methanol at temperatures higher than 100 C. Other byproducts such as formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbons are secondary products derived from primary methanol.237
As we have seen in the case of polyoxometalates, a widely used methodology to recover the catalyst is support the soluble Lewis acids onto an insoluble solid. In the next section, we will comment in detail on examples of this simple approach in the way towards isotropic (same composition and properties along the whole particle) solid catalysts.
4. Heterogeneized Homogeneous Lewis Acids as Oxidation Catalysts
a.Transition Metals Exchanged or Supported on Solids as Oxidation Catalysts. In many oxidation processes in liquid phase, homogeneous catalysts in the form of oxometallic soluble complexes are used. However, these catalysts may present some limitations derived from the tendency of oxometallic species to oligomerize forming μ-oxo complexes catalytically inactive, and also from the oxidative destruction of the ligands of the complex.
It appears that from the catalyst recovering point of view as well as for increasing the catalyst stability, it would be convenient to isolate and stabilize the metallic species by incorporating them into inorganic matrices and producing heterogeneous solid catalysts for liquid phase oxidations. This can be done by impregnating the active species on inorganic carriers, by anchoring one of the ligands of a transition metal complex on inorganic or organic carrier, by including ship in a bottle the metal complex within the cavities of a micro or mesoporous molecular sieve, by exchanging the Lewis acid in zeolites, and finally by synthesizing molecular sieves with framework Lewis acids able to carry out oxidation reactions.
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates whose lattice consists of a network of SiO44- and AlO45- tetrahedra with Si or Al atoms at the centers and oxygen atoms in each corner. 238-242 The tetrahedra share the corners or edges; thus, the number of oxygens is twice that of Si plus Al atoms. In contrast to amorphous silica or silicaalumina, which lack long-range ordering, zeolites are crystalline; their tetrahedra are spatially arranged in strictly regular fashion.
A network of SiO44- tetrahedra is neutral; each AlO45- tetrahedron introduces one negative charge in the lattice. The negative charges are balanced by an appropriate number of cations, usually mono- or dipositive, inorganic or organic. Typical cations include alkali metal and quaternary ammonium ions. Since the chemical bonds between the crystalline framework and the cations are ionic, it is possible to exchange the cations partially or completely for different ones without modification of the rigid lattice. 243 The cations occupy empty space within the zeolites, in close proximity to the negative charges.
Concerning the chemical composition of the framework, the most important parameter is the Si/Al ratio. It may vary from Si/Al = 1 (faujasite X) to Si/Al =  (silicalite). The Al or any other TIII atom content of the silicate determines the number of cations in the framework, as well as other properties such as the thermal and chemical stability or the polarity of the internal surfaces. Typically, zeolites with a high Al content (X zeolite) are thermally and chemically less stable. In such cases, dehydration at high temperature may cause partial dealumination by the water being desorbed with a decrease of crystallinity (self-steaming). 244 The chemical composition of synthetic zeolites can be controlled at two different stages: during the synthesis by varying the composition of the gels, or by postsynthetic modifications of as-synthesized samples.
Concerning the crystal structure of zeolites, the long-range ordering of the primary tetrahedra defines nondeformable channels and cavities of strictly uniform dimensions on the molecular scale (nanometer dimensions). 245,246 This porosity explains why the surface area per unit weight of zeolites is among the highest for any solid. The total surface area of zeolites is the sum of the external and internal surfaces.
Brnsted acid sites in zeolites are due to hydroxyl groups bridging a Si and Al atom. 247-249 The H+ forms of zeolites can be prepared from alkali ion containing forms by ion exchange with concentrated hydrochloric acid at elevated temperatures. This procedure usually results in partial dealumination, causing damage to the crystalline structure. A milder dealumination method implies the exchange of alkali ions by NH4+, and subsequent thermal decomposition eliminates NH3, leaving H+ in the framework. Likewise, calcination of as-synthesized zeolites containing quaternary ammonium ions generates a proton in the lattice. The protons of acidic zeolites are not free, but covalently bonded to the oxygen closest to a negatively charged aluminum, forming oxonium species. The bridging Si(OH)-Al hydroxy groups can be monitored by IR spectroscopy.
Zeolites may contain Lewis sites in addition to Brnsted sites.247 These sites can be attributed to tricoordinated or partially dislodged Al centers. However, this type of Al has resisted detection by 27Al MAS NMR. On the other hand, samples exhibiting Lewis acidity have octahedrally coordinated Al extraframework species, and these extraframework Al species (EFAL) show Lewis acidity. EFAL centers are generated during steaming or calcination of hydrated zeolites, especially of the NH4+ or H+ forms. EFAL not only generates Lewis sites, but also reduces the population of Brnsted centers. Two types of EFALs can be distinguished. Mild steaming conditions favor low-weight oligomers of cationic polyoxoaluminate EFAL species, which can be removed by treatment with oxalic acid or (NH4)2SiF6,240 whereas more drastic steaming conditions lead to highly condensed (polymeric) EFAL, that cannot be dissolved by (NH4)2SiF6.
Finally, the interaction with EFAL Lewis sites is expected to enhance the strength of Brnsted sites also present. 250,251 The enhancement of Brnsted acidity by Lewis sites has also been invoked in other cases to explain the superacidity of sulfated zirconia and related transition metal superacidic oxides.250,251
In the case of zeolites, transition metal elements can be introduced in different structures, different oxidation states, and coordinations, either as extraframework exchanged cations, supported metal clusters, supported metal oxides, complexes or as lattice cations. These transition metals present in the composition of the zeolite will be responsible for the activity of the zeolite as catalysts in oxidation reactions.
For instance, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ ion exchanged X zeolite is able to oxidize n-hexane with O2 in liquid phase to yield 70 to 80% selectivity to acetic acid. The fact that the rate of formation of acetic acid is the same for the metal exchanged zeolites than for the homogeneous reaction with those metals, may indicate not only that the metals leach out of the zeolite but also that the leached metals play a determinant role in the observed activity.
Methane is an abundant hydrocarbon, and new processes to effect its partial oxidation are desirable. In this context, it has been found that water has a detrimental influence on the activity of In/HZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst for the selective oxidation of methane by nitric oxide. Apparently, water interacts with the Lewis acid sites of the zeolite and retards the transformation of NO into NO2 an elementary step in the oxidation of methane by NO. 252 The co-incorporation of Pt, Rh, or Ir to the In/HZSM-5 zeolite renders the catalyst more tolerant to the presence of water vapor.
Chromium oxide supported on mesoporous MCM-41 as well as Zr- or La-doped silica has been found to be an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane at temperatures between 350 and 550 C. The partial substitution of Cr(III) ions by Al(III) increases the Brnsted and Lewis acidity and favors the selectivity to propene. 253 On the other hand, substitution of Cr(III) by Ga increases the number of Lewis acid sites and the oxidizing power of the solid.253
Ethylene and propylene have been oxidized using transition metals on zeolites. For instance, ethylene is selectively oxidized to ethylene oxide on Ag+ impregnated on zeolites, but selectivity is low on Ag+ exchanged zeolites. 254 Propylene dissolved in benzene was oxidized with O2 at 150 C and 45 bar on molybdenum impregnated X zeolite with high selectivities to the epoxide. However, for conversions above 5% further oxidation of the epoxide occurs with formation of methanol, formic and acetic acid as well as esters of the epoxide and the above acids. 255 Propylene can be oxidized to acetone by Mo or Pd/Cu exchanged Y zeolites. 256-260 With the Pd/Cu catalyst the active component for olefin oxidation is Pd2+, and Cu2+ is used as a promoter for the reoxidation of Pd0.
Dealuminated Y zeolites were used to encapsulate Mo(CO)6. 261 Subsequent decarbonylation renders a solid that can act as catalyst in ammonia decomposition. The oxidation state of molybdenum and the overall acidity of the material correlates with its catalytic activity toward ammonia decomposition.261
Transition metals such as copper and iron can be introduced in MCM-41 by ion exchange. Even all-silica MCM-41 that has no charge-balancing cations can admit substantial amounts of iron ions from a methanolic solution. These mesoporous MCM-41 containing Cu2+ or Fe3+ can act as redox catalysts and can convert N2O into NO at room temperature. 262
Fe3+- and Cu2+- exchanged Al/MCM-41 have been found convenient catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol by oxygen or air to form 1,1-binaphthyl (Scheme 23). 263 High conversion and good selectivities have been achieved using Fe-Al/MCM-41.263 This coupling can also be performed using FeCl3/SiO2, FeCl3/Al2O3, Fe3+-exchanged montmorillonite, and Fe3+ and Cu2+ exchanged Y zeolite. 264 In the latter case, a large fraction of the product formed inside the zeolite cavities cannot diffuse out and remains trapped due to the large molecular size of binaphthyl compared to the windows of Y zeolite (0.74 nm).
Scheme 23
Highly dispersed transition metal oxides were obtained by ion-exchanging commercial NaY zeolite with the corresponding salts of transition metal and treating them with NaOH. The resulting zeolites containing encapsulated transition metal oxides, particularly the cobalt oxide@Y, were found to be active to effect the complete oxidation of air-diluted toluene. 265
b.Encapsulated Transition Metals as Oxidation Catalysts. One of the simplest strategy to convert an homogeneous into heterogeneous catalyst is by supporting it by impregnation on a solid. 266 This leads to catalysts that very easily leach the active species in solution, and therefore this method has limited interest unless it is demonstrated beyond any doubt that no migration of the active sites to the liquid phase occurs during extensive use of the catalyst. A procedure for avoiding leaching or, at least, for strongly reducing the process, will be to encapsulate the active bulky species within the cavities of zeolites.
A step forward in the application of Lewis acids for oxidation process, involves the encapsulation of methyltrioxorhenium or tungstates and heteropolytungstates using H2O2 as oxidant. Both types of catalysts have shown to be effective for epoxidation with H2O2 in homogeneous phase.156,267,268 Thus, methyltrioxorhenium has been adsorbed within the supercages of zeolite NaY and used as heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of silanes to silanols and epoxidation of olefins using hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 24). 269 Both reaction types proceed with high conversions and selectivities using the encapsulated organometallic compound. In particular, the formation of disiloxanes in one case or the vic-diols in the other, being two processes normally occurring using the homogeneous MeReO3 catalyst, are not observed using encapsulated MeReO3@NaY. These two undesired processes occur from the adventitious Lewis acid-catalyzed condensation of two silanols or from the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring aperture. The high selectivity of the oxidation of MeReO3@NaY was interpreted as due to the spatial restrictions imposed by the zeolite lattice to the occurrence of bimolecular reactions.
Scheme 24
One problem encountered in the oxidation of hydrocarbons with hydrogen peroxide is the inmiscibility of both type of liquids and the difficulty of having an appreciable concentration of substrate and oxidant at the catalytic center. To overcome this problem, an elegant strategy has been to attach covalently poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) chains to the surface of the silica particles containing methyltrioxorhenium. 270 The presence of these polymeric chains greatly increases the miscibility of the two liquid phases on the catalyst surface. The resulting solid efficiently catalyzes the epoxidation of alkenes with hydrogen peroxide.
The influence of encapsulation inside the pores of zeolite on the activity and selectivity of incorporated guest can be exemplified by the case of mixed ironmolybdenum oxides encapsulated in boralite (FeMo/ Bor). For the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde, the activity and selectivity of FeMo/Bor have been compared with that of two other conventional catalysts for this process such as vanadium oxide supported on titania and bulk Fe2(MoO4)3. 271 V/TiO2 exhibits a pronounced decrease in the selectivity toward benzaldehyde at increasing toluene conversions compared to FeMo/Bor. This effect was attributed to the presence of stronger Lewis acid sites in V/TiO2 which activate the CO group facilitating its further oxidation to benzoate derivatives. On the other hand, FeMo/Bor shows higher selectivity than Fe2(MoO4)3 at low toluene conversions due to the spatial constraints to the catalytic activity of the mixed FeMo by the zeolite channels, but lower selectivity at high conversions. In the latter case, the longer residence time due to diffusion limitations inside the zeolite channels facilitates the occurrence of secondary reactions in which the aromatic ring undergoes further oxidation to form maleic anhydride and carbon oxides.271
In an extensive series of articles, Barton and co-workers have developed and optimized different catalytic systems, commonly termed as Gif systems, to perform the oxidation of alkanes with hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxides in solution. 272-280 One of the most convenient systems uses the complex of Fe3+ and picolinic acid working in a mixture of acetonitrilepyridine as solvent and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant.276,277 A heterogeneous version of this reaction has been reported in which the Fe3+-picolinate complex has been assembled inside the pores of Fe3+-exchanged zeolites by subsequent addition of picolinic acid. 281 The complex remains immobilized inside the zeolite cavities and channels. This encapsulated complex can catalyze the oxidation of cyclohexane with 93% hydrogen peroxide selectivity toward oxidation at 49% cyclohexane conversion and >90% cyclohexanone selectivity.281
Cu2+-phthalocyanine and Co2+-perfluorophthalocyanine have been prepared inside the pores of MCM-41 by heating a mixture of o-dicyanobenzene and Cu2+ or Co2+-exchanged MCM-41 at 200 C under reduced pressure for 24 h (Scheme 25). 282 The resulting solids supporting metal phthalocyanines have been tested as catalyst for cyclohexane oxidation with hydrogen peroxide or TBHP. The latter was found a more convenient oxidizing reagent. Co2+perfluorophthalocyanine supported on MCM-41 was found more active than the same unsupported complex or when encapsulated in zeolite Y. However, the selectivity of the oxidant toward oxidation of cyclohexane was only moderate.282
Scheme 25
One remarkable example of an encapsulated transition metal complex is the case of chiral Mn(III) salen complex entrapped within the cages of zeolites Y and EMT. 283,284 The complex was prepared by performing the ship-in-a-bottle synthesis of the salen ligand derived from 1,2-diaminocyclohexane around resident Mn(II) ions (Scheme 26). These solids were active for the asymmetric epoxidation of aryl olefins with iodosylbenzene. The highest enantiomeric excesses achieved with the encapsulated complex (60%) were, however, significantly lower than those achieved for the same complex in homogeneous phase (>90% ee).179
Scheme 26
c.Transition Metal Lewis Acids Grafted on Solids. In general, it has to be remarked that metals either exchanged or impregnated in zeolites can leach when operated in liquid phase processes, especially if polar reactants or products are involved. This will also apply to supported metal oxides on other carriers. However, special mention should be made to the Shell catalyst 285 that consists of titanium covalently grafted on silica (Ti/SiO2). This is a real heterogeneous oxidation catalyst that works in liquid phase, but which is only active with organic peroxides. The catalyst containing between 1 and 2.5 wt % of TiO2 on silica is prepared by impregnating silica (high surface fume silica) with a Ti(IV) precursor that affords after activation TiO- grafted on the surface silanols of the support. TiCl4 and Ti(O-i-Pr)4 are good precursors that leave Ti(IV) attached to the surface by at least three silanol groups. 286-288 It has been shown that a SiTi (O-i-Pr) catalyst treated with tartaric acid was active for epoxidations with 30% H2O2 at 80 C with reactive olefins such as cyclooctene or cyclohexene. The last cycloalkene gives mixtures of epoxide, cyclohexane-1,2-diol, and allylic oxidation products. Ti(IV)/SiO2 Shell type catalyst offers an alternative to ARCO's technology (oxirane process) for the production of epoxides and more specifically propylene epoxide using an alkyl hydroperoxide. ARCO's process uses a homogeneous catalyst based on Mo. The reaction proceeds via a peroxometal pathway, and the active catalyst contains the metal in its highest oxidation state. Metals with low oxidation potential and high Lewis acidity in their highest oxidation states are superior catalysts and show the order of reactivity Mo(VI) > W(VI) > V(V) > Ti(IV). 289 The activity of these homogeneous catalysts is strongly diminished by the presence of polar molecules such as H2O, alcohols, and especially glycols that can strongly coordinate with the metal. The epoxidation is stereospecific, i.e., cis olefins give only cis epoxides, and the rate increases with increasing the electron density at the CC double bond, i.e., with increasing the substitution of the double bond by electron donating alkyl groups. This effect is consistent with a nonradical mechanism involving an electrophilic oxidant. 290
The development by Shell of the heterogeneous silica-supported titania catalyst described before was an important step toward an environmentally benign catalyst. Commercially, it is applied to the epoxidation of propylene with ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. The alcohol coproduct is dehydrated in a separate stage to styrene. The higher catalytic activity of Ti(IV)/SiO2 with respect to soluble Ti(IV) was attributed to the site isolation and fixation of Ti(IV) on the surface that prevents oligomerization to unreactive μ-oxo species. Formation of these μ-oxo species readily occurs with soluble Ti(IV) catalyst. 291 It also appears that the Lewis acidity of Ti(IV) is increased when on silica due to electron withdrawing by silanoxy ligands. Unfortunately, the Ti/SiO2 catalyst is deactivated by the presence of H2O,289 and consequently this catalyst is not efficient using H2O2 as oxidant. A similar problem arises from the amorphous titaniasilica mixed oxides prepared by the solution solgel procedure. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and polycondensation of Ti- and Si-alkoxides gives amorphous mixed oxides with Ti contents much higher than the 2.5 wt % achieved in the Ti(IV) grafted silica. These materials prepared by the solgel procedure, when dried by extraction with supercritical CO2, yields a mesoporous material with a very high surface area and isolated Ti(IV). 292 As described earlier for Shell catalysts, these materials are sensitive to water and are not suitable for working with H2O2, even when its hydrophobicity is increased. 293,294
Mixed Ti/Si oxides have been analyzed by EXAFS. This study has revealed that, while octahedral Ti coordination predominates at high Ti percentages, the amount of tetrahedral Ti increases as the Ti content decreases reaching a maximum between 10 and 20 mol % of Ti. 295 Lewis acid measurements and catalytic activity for 1-octene epoxidation with TBHP indicate that these two features are due to tetrahedral Ti. It is proposed that the coordinative unsaturated tetrahedral Ti can expand its coordination sphere by interaction with a Lewis base or with the hydroperoxide.295
Comparison of the performance of unmodified and dimethylaminopropyl-modified TiO2/SiO2 aerogels for α-isophorone epoxidation with TBHP establishes that the amine group diminishes the epoxidation activity of TiO2/SiO2, but it also eliminates the activity in acid-catalyzed side reactions, such as epoxide ring aperture and peroxide decomposition. 296 It was found that addition of methanol to an unmodified TiO2/SiO2 has a similar effect. These observations suggest that the electron donation by the alkylamino groups or methanol to the Ti active site (Lewis acid) suppresses its acidity and, thus, inhibiting acid-catalyzed reactions. On the other hand, the surface SiOH groups of TiO2/SiO2 have low activity for epoxide decomposition.296
5. Soluble Compounds as Models for the Active Sites in Solid Lewis Acid Oxidation Catalysts
In the way to the development of solid catalysts and understanding of the nature of their active sites, a line of research consists of the preparation of soluble molecules or metal complexes with well-defined molecular structure that could serve as models for the sites present in the solid. Normally, a solid catalyst contains a distribution of different catalytic sites varying in the coordination sphere or in the location of the site in the solid. It is believed that the intrinsic catalytic activity of a given metal atom can be different from others depending on the actual structure. Therefore, the optimum solid catalyst should contain the maximum density of the most active metal atoms while being devoid of others with lower activity and selectivity.
An example of the previous strategy is the preparation of titanosilsesquioxanes with different structures to test their catalytic activity in the epoxidation of olefins. 297-299 As it will be commented, solid titanosilicates are widely used as solid catalysts for the epoxidation of alkenes, hydroxylation of aromatics, oxidation of alcohols and amines, etc. The question is which types of titanium atoms are the most active. One approach to address the specific activity of sites with different coordination around the titanium atoms consists of crossing the structural information from characterization techniques such as EXAFS and XANES obtained for a series of solids with the catalytic tests of the series. However, due to the current low resolution of solid characterization techniques, the degree of uncertainty of this approach is always higher than the use of molecular titanosilsesquioxanes having a structure analogous to that of a cluster of titanosilicate.
In the way to solid epoxidation catalysts titanosilsesquioxanes, that are excellent homogeneous catalysts for epoxidation of olefins using TBHP, have been heterogeneized by adsorbing them in the pores of MCM-41. Previously, the MCM-41 was modified by silylation with Ph2SiCl2 to passivate the external surface. 300 The supported titanosilsesquioxane is claimed to be a reusable catalyst for epoxidation with tert-butylhydroperoxide.
Likewise, the influence of the coordination sphere of each active titanium site in titanogermanosilicate solids has been addressed by preparing soluble titanogermanosilsesquioxane and determining separately the activity of each compound and the influence of the presence of germanium. 301
Studying the specific reactivity of soluble complexes with different structures allows one to assess the intrinsic activity of each site. An additional refinement of this strategy is to prepare even the catalytically active oxo intermediate, such as the oxo complex. This allows the determination in homogeneous phase of the rate of elementary steps such as hydrogen abstraction or the transfer of an oxo group. An example of this approach has been the synthesis of a limited number of transition metal hydroxycarbonyls. 302-304 These metallic complexes are the reaction intermediates in various transition metal catalyzed reactions of CO and H2O including the oxidation of CO, the homogeneous water-gas shift, and the formation of metal hydrides. Although, as expected, β-elimination to give a metal hydride and CO2 is the usual mode of decomposition, it was demonstrated that the ease of this process is metal- and ligand-dependent. For trans-Pt(CO2H)(C6H6)(PEt3)2, an alternative route was identified in which CO and H2O are lost and a dinuclear complex having a bridging CO2 is formed (Scheme 27). 305
Scheme 27
Giving the potential of this methodology to understand the activity of solid catalysts, it can be anticipated that more effort would be dedicated to the synthesis of soluble mimics of solid active centers. This methodology relies on the fact that the reaction intermediates in solution are analogous to those present in the solids. However, immobilization of the active site may alter the reaction mechanism. Thus, the mechanism of the solution-phase homogeneous oxidation of pyrocatechol using cobalt or vanadium oxides was found to be different to that of the vapor-phase heterogeneous process. 306
6. Transition Metal Lewis Acids in the Walls of Mesoporous Molecular Sieves
Mesoporous molecular sieves and more specifically Ti-MCM-41 were first synthesized in 1994. 307,308 This material with surface areas  800 m2 g-1 showed the Ti to be tetrahedrally coordinated and isolated in the silica matrix. 309 The larger pore size of this mesoporous solid makes it more active as catalysts for reactions in which large substrates and reagents participate, even though its intrinsic activity measured for small reagents has been determined to be considerably lower than for TS-1 or Ti/Beta titanosilicates. Ti-MCM-41 was active and selective for carrying out the epoxidation of olefins with both TBHP and with H2O2, but the results were much better with TBHP. After this, other Ti-containing mesoporous molecular sieves such as HMS, MCM-48, MSU, UTD-1, and JDF-L1 have been synthesized.308,310-314 These are hydrophilic materials that adsorb H2O and due to the Lewis acidity of the Ti atoms opens the epoxides giving thiols. These diols become strongly adsorbed on the Ti sites leading not only to a decrease of epoxide selectivity but also to a decrease in catalyst activity. A thorough study of catalyst synthesis together with postsynthesis treatments was carried out by Corma et al. 315,316 They showed that by optimizing the synthesis of Ti-MCM-41 in the absence of TMAOH, and by the proper silylation of the surface of the resulting material very active and extremely selective epoxidation catalysts could be produced when using either TBHP or cumene hydroperoxide as oxidizing agents, with feeds that contain even 2 wt % of H2O (Figure 1). These catalysts offer great promise for epoxidation of propylene using organic peroxides, owing to their extremely high selectivity to the epoxide and the very low formation of diols, that minimize deactivation and increase the catalyst life.
Figure 1 Influence of the silylation (as degree of surface coverage) of Ti/MCM-41 on the conversion (a) and selectivity (b) for the cyclohexene epoxidation with TBHP (Reprinted with permission from ref 315. Copyright 1998 Chemical Society London).
It has been reported that Ti/MCM-41 in which Lewis acid sites are also present can act as a bifunctional catalyst in the one-step conversion of α-pinene to campholenic aldehyde, promoting the epoxidation of the CC double bond and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting pinene epoxide with ring aperture. 317
Mesoporous molecular sieves with transition metals other than Ti (Zr, V, Sn) have also been prepared. They are active for oxidation reactions with organic peroxides and H2O2, but the possibility of metal leaching should be carefully addressed in each case.123,318-325
Nb-containing MCM-41 has been modified with ammonium and copper cations and tested for several oxidation reactions including NO decomposition, selective oxidation of NH3 by NO, hydrosulfurization of methanol, and oxidation of thioethers with hydrogen peroxide to sulfoxides. 326 The same Nb/MCM-41 solid after ion exchange with ammonium and dehydroxylation exhibits Lewis acidity and is able to catalyze the reaction of methanol with hydrogen sulfide to form methanethiol.326 On the other hand, although Cu2+ ions adsorbed on Nb/MCM-41 show a higher reducibility as compared with Al/MCM-41, this does not lead to a higher activity of Nb/MCM-41 for the catalytic NO decomposition.326
Vanadium-containing MCM-41 has equally been prepared and found to exhibit catalytic activity toward the gas-phase partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. 327 The solid is stable under reaction conditions at 350 C. The main active site is proposed to be isolated tetrahedral vanadium atoms coordinated to surrounding oxygen anions, which is the predominant site at vanadium percentages below 0.41 wt %.327
Enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols using titanium complexes of diethyl tartrate175-178,328 has been a significant achievement in asymmetric catalysis, that paved the way to enantioselective epoxidation in general. Some work has been carried out trying to obtain Ti-containing solids for the heterogeneous version of allylic alcohol epoxidation. Thus, epoxidation of allylic alcohols with TBHP can be catalyzed by titanium-containing pillared montmorillonites. 329 The pillars are polymeric Ti cations formed by partial hydrolysis of TiCl4 with HCl. The interlayer distance, specific surface area, and thermal stability of the resulting pillared clay depend on the pH of the pillaring solution. For a H+/Ti ratio of 0.24, the Ti-pillared clay shows a basal spacing of 2.6 nm, a specific surface area of 316 m2 g-1 and does not collapse at temperatures below 500 C.329 This titanium-containing clay catalyzes the oxidation of (E)-2-hexen-1-ol with TBHP in the presence of diethyl tartrate with 50% yield, when it has been activated by calcining the solid in air at 500 C and the reaction is conducted at 23 C.329 This yield is comparable to that reported for the same allylic alcohol using polymer supported Ti(IV) as catalyst.329
7. Transition Metal Lewis Acids in the Framework of Microporous Molecular Sieves
a.TiSilicalite. An important breakthrough in the use of Lewis acids as heterogeneous environmentally friendly catalysts was the discovery of the activity of Ti-silicalite (TS-1) as a catalyst for a series of useful oxidation reactions using H2O2 as oxidant. 330-333 TS-1 is a zeolite with MFI structure whose topology is formed by a two-channel system with diameters 0.53 × 0.56 and 0.51 × 0.51 nm, respectively. Ti was incorporated in the framework of silicalite as isolated tetrahedral Ti(IV), and it appears that the site isolation resulting from the incorporation during the synthesis of the molecular sieves produces the most promising type of solid Lewis acids oxidation catalysts for liquid-phase operations. These Ti-containing silicalites should be, in principle, more stable toward leaching taking into account the lower accessibility of the TiO bonds. On top of this, Ti-zeolites have adsorption properties that can be tuned from the point of view of their hydrophobicityhydrophilicity, allowing a certain control on the proportions of reactants with different polarities within the pores. Thus, owing to the silica framework with little number of defects, the TS-1 is a hydrophobic catalyst that can use H2O2 as oxidant. Using this environmentally friendly oxidant, reactions such as oxidation of alcohols, epoxidation of linear olefins, hydroxylation of aromatics, ammoximation of cyclohexanone, oxidation of alkanes to alcohols and ketones, oxidation of amines, oxidation of sulfur-containing compounds, and oxidation of ethers, among others, have been carried out selectively with TS-1.114,334-340 A summary of the reactions catalyzed by TS-1 is given in Figure 2.
Figure 2 Oxidation reactions catalyzed by TS-1.
The proper design of TS-1 catalysts involves the introduction during the synthesis of Ti in framework positions. A necessary requirement for the successful synthesis of TS-1 is to carry it out in the absence of significant amounts of alkali metal ions to avoid the precipitation of alkali titanates during the synthesis.
Different synthesis routes have been proposed using various Si and Ti precursors, and several structure directing agents (SDA) and mineralizers. A summary of those is given in Figure 3.
Figure 3 Summary of the synthetic procedures to obtain TS-1.
Since the first moment, the exceptional oxidation properties of TS-1 were related to the presence of isolated tetrahedral Ti(IV) in framework positions, since silicalite was not active and TiO2 (anatase) produced the decomposition of H2O2. 341 However, it is not easy to prove unequivocally the incorporation of Ti in framework positions since the low Ti contents (12 wt %) make impossible the determination by XRD. The importance of these catalysts has triggered a large effort on characterization, and a combination of XRD, IR, UVVisible, XPS, and EXAFS/XANES spectroscopies have confirmed the presence and the amount of TI(IV) framework sites. A good review on this has been published recently. 342 More recently, electrochemical and photochemical techniques have also been used to address this issue. 343-345
On the basis of the above characterization techniques, two structures differing in the presence of titanyl groups (TiO) or tetrahedral Ti have been proposed for the isolated Ti(IV) species (Scheme 28).
Scheme 28
The presence of titanyl groups is consistent with the observation of a band at 960 cm-1 in the IR spectrum of TS-1. However, other pieces of evidence do not confirm this assignment. For instance, the UVVisible spectrum of TS-1 does not show a band between 25000 and 35000 cm-1 characteristic of the TiO group. On the other hand, the position of the 960 cm-1 IR band is not modified by D2O treatment, but it shifts to lower frequencies with the H217O exchange. 346 Furthermore, the intensity of this band is not affected by the treatment of the sample with SO2.14 Thus, even if it is now generally accepted that Ti is tetrahedrally coordinated with framework oxygens, Sinclair and Catlow do not rule out the formation of TiO groups under the reaction conditions. 347 These titanyl groups would be formed by hydrolysis of the TiOSi bond in the presence of H2O.
The geometry of the Ti centers has been successfully determined by means of UVVisible and EXAFS/XANES spectroscopies. Indeed, the dehydrated TS-1 shows a UVVisible band at 48000 cm-1, that is not present in silicalite, and which is associated to charge-transfer processes localized in isolated Ti atoms in tetrahedral coordination. 348 The presence of polymeric species of hexacoordinated Ti gives rise to an absorption band at 42000 cm-1, while anatase or rutile have absorption bands at 3000035000 cm-1. 349
The XANES spectrum of TS-1 and its comparison with other Ti compounds in which the coordination of Ti is well established has revealed the presence in dehydrated TS-1 samples of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti. 350,351
The incorporation of Ti in the MFI structure produces an expansion of the framework and an increase in the tension around the Ti center owing to the larger [TiO4] size compared to [SiO4] tetrahedra. The Ti(IV) can interact with H2O producing the hydrolysis of one or more TiOSi bonds, which results in a local relaxation of the structure at the Ti sites. It is important to point out that for acting as a catalytic site, the Ti(IV) in TS-1 has to interact with reactants. Thus, to be able to increase its coordination number during the adsorption process, Ti should move from the original framework position to another more external and relaxed in which the SiOTi bonds will be more polarized and elongated with respect to the normal values. The ability of Ti in TS-1 to increase the coordination sphere without becoming separated from the zeolite framework is a key point for the special catalytic properties of Ti in TS-1 and more generally Ti in zeolites.
Following the chemistry of the Ti(IV) complexes in liquid phase, H2O2 acts as a bidentate ligand (η2-O2) replacing other ligands to form very stable metallodioxirane or peroxo complexes (Scheme 29). The organic hydroperoxides form a peroxocomplex analogous to the hydroperoxy species shown in Scheme 29.
Scheme 29
The interaction of H2O2 with the Ti centers of Ti-zeolites generates a UVVisible band at 26000 cm-1 which has been assigned to a charge-transfer interaction between the hydroperoxide (OOH) ligand and Ti(IV). 352 Nevertheless, the [Ti(O2)F5]3- ion also shows an absorption band at 26000 cm-1 which can be associated to the O22-  Ti4+ charge transfer. Thus, it becomes difficult to distinguish between hydroperoxy and titanodioxirane based on the UVVisible spectra. Some authors have considered a tetrahedral metallodioxirane species as the reaction intermediate on TS-1 (Scheme 29). However, this species cannot explain the effect of acids, bases, and solvents on the reaction kinetics, nor the high activity of TS-1 with diluted solutions of H2O2 in protic media. 353
Nevertheless, Talsi claims 354 that with the adequate ligands, the Ti peroxo complexes (Ti(O2)(OEt)2L2) can be active in oxidation reactions and the acidbase and solvent effects could be explained as a function of its coordination to the tetrahedral titanodioxirane species. In presence of H2O2, TS-1 behaves as a Brnsted acid catalyzing the opening of the epoxides by addition of H2O or alcohol.346 This fact suggests that the active species involves a tetrahedral hydroperoxy type ligand (Scheme 29). On the other hand, the stability achieved by the pentacyclic structure (Scheme 30) makes possible the acid dissociation.
Scheme 30
The dependence of the reaction rate on the nature of the solvent seems to indicate that a molecule of solvent is involved with the active species.353 Moreover, the cyclic hydroperoxy species is similar to the intermediates proposed in oxidation reactions with organic peracids and the transition metal complexes of groups IVVI, with H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides.
b.Large Pore Ti-Zeolites. Owing to the relatively small pore diameter of the 10-member ring Ti-zeolites synthesized, i.e., TS-1, TS-2 (MELS structure) and ZSM-48, 355-357 efforts have been made to synthesize large pore 12-member ring Ti zeolites. Among them the incorporation of Ti by direct synthesis has been demonstrated for BEA (Ti-Beta), MTW (Ti-ZSM-12), ISV (Ti-ITQ-7), and MWW (Ti-MCM-22).
Ti-Beta can be prepared by several synthetic procedures. The first Ti-Beta was prepared in basic medium, in the presence of Al in the synthesis gel. 358,359 The resulting material was active and selective for the oxidation of olefins, alcohols, alkanes, and organic sulfur compounds and hydroxylation of phenol with H2O2 or organic peroxides. 360-362 By means of IR and UVVisible spectroscopy, XRD, thermal analysis, XPS, EXAFS-XANES, the state of Ti in the sample of Ti-Al-Beta was established. 363 In the calcined and dehydrated sample the coordination of Ti is four, and in this coordination state Ti is linked to four OSi groups. When the calcined zeolite was rehydrated a TiOSi bond becomes hydrolyzed, giving a tetrahedral species with a TiOH group and a silanol group. This TiOH species can be further hydrated leading to pentacoordinated Ti. When the characterization results for TiAlBeta and TS-1 and TS-2 were compared, it was shown that in the calcined and dehydrated samples a similar coordination of Ti occurs. While TiAlBeta was an active oxidation catalyst, the presence of Al(IV) generated Brnsted acid sites that have, for some reactions, a negative impact on selectivity. For instance, during the catalytic epoxidation of olefins, the resulting epoxides undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening to afford diols and/or rearrangement products. However, the Brnsted acidity could be neutralized by treatment with alkali metal acetates. 364 While in some cases the preparation of bifunctional catalysts involving a proton and a Ti site can be of interest as in the production of furanes and pyranes derived from linalool, 365 in most cases the epoxide is the desired product. Therefore, there was the need for synthesizing TiBeta free of TIII elements. Following a cogel synthetic procedure, samples of Ti-Beta with very high Si/Al ratios were synthesized and an increase in turnover number and selectivity to epoxide during epoxidation of 1-hexene and activity in the hydroxylation of benzene with H2O2 was observed when increasing the Si/Al ratio. 366,367 The following step toward the synthesis of Al-free Ti-Beta samples was given by starting with very small Al free seeds of Beta zeolite and using them to grow Al-free Ti-Beta. 368 A similar procedure but using deboronated boron Beta seeds and di(cyclohexylmethyl) dimethylammonium hydroxide as structure directing agent (SDA) was used to prepare TIII free Ti-Beta. 369 The resulting sample was active as epoxidation as well as Lewis acid catalyst for the gas-phase MeerweinPonndorfVerley reactions. 370 Finally, Al free Ti-Beta has been synthesized in basic medium using 4,4-trimethylenebis(N-benzyl-N-methylpiperidinium) dihydroxide or di-(cyclohexylmethyl)-dimethylammonium hydroxide as SDA. 371-373 The above SDA are difficult to synthesize and it would be of interest to obtain Al-free Ti-Beta using the commercially available TEA hydroxide as SDA. This has been achieved by using F- as silica mineralizing agent. 374 It has to be pointed out that while Ti-Beta synthesized in OH- media resulted in samples with many internal defects (silanol groups) and therefore with a more hydrophilic zeolite, the synthesis in F- media gave Ti-Beta samples that were highly hydrophobic that gave the best turnover and epoxide selectivity during the epoxidation of olefins (see Table 2). 375

It becomes clear that in an oxidation process that requires the simultaneous presence of nonpolar (1-hexene) and polar (H2O2 aq) reactants within the zeolite pores, the hydrophobicityhydrophilicity of the catalyst will play an important role. In the case of TS-1 the hydrophobicity of the final sample is influenced by the presence of nonframework titanium.376 Nevertheless, even for hydrophobic Ti-Beta its activity and selectivity are still lower than those for TS-1 for molecules that can diffuse in TS-1. Nevertheless, Ti-Beta gives a higher activity for bulkier reactants. This means that besides hydrophobicity other structural factors also play an important role. In this respect, one should take into account that in solidliquid-phase processes, diffusion can be in many cases a limiting step, and consequently, a catalyst factor to be considered, besides pore diameter, is the zeolite crystal size. The smaller the crystallite size, the faster will be the rate of diffusion for molecules that can diffuse through the pores. Ti content may influence the zeolite crystal size, decreasing this when increasing Ti content in TS-1.377,378 It has been found that the synthesis variable that has a stronger impact on Ti-zeolite crystal size is the nature of the mineralizing agent. This has been studied for both TS-1 and Ti-Beta, and it is shown that synthesis in F- media generally produces larger crystallites than the synthesis in OH- media. 379-381
The intrinsic acidity of the Ti Lewis sites in a particular structure and even in different T positions of a given zeolite structure can also influence the final activity of the catalyst. A theoretical study on the Lewis acidity of Ti on the different crystallographic positions in silicalite and Beta has concluded 382 that Ti will not necessarily occupy framework positions in a random distribution. Moreover, differences on the Lewis acidity of Ti are expected depending on the different crystallographic positions. It has to be pointed out that, in general, the calculated Lewis acidity of Ti in the Beta structure is higher than in TS-1. Experimentally, the acidity of Ti-zeolites has been studied by means of IR spectroscopy 383 volumetry and microcalorimetry 384,385 of adsorption of weak (CO) and stronger bases (NH3, pyridine, CD3CN). In the particular case of TS-1, the spectrum of adsorbed pyridine shows bands at 1605, 1490, 1445 cm-1 associated to adsorption on Lewis acid sites, 386 but not the band at 1545 cm-1 which corresponds to the protonated pyridine. The presence of Lewis acid sites in TS-1 and TS-2 has also been confirmed by other techniques, 387 which also include their activity for Mukaiyama and Michael additions, and MeerweinPonndorfVerley reactions that are typically catalyzed by Lewis acids.340,370,388 In the case of Ti-Beta zeolites, the IR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on two samples of Ti-Beta, one synthesized in OH- and the other synthesized in F- media have been recorded.379
The Al-free Ti-Beta synthesized in OH- media with many internal defects and which has a certain hydrophilic character shows bands at 1607, 1490, and 1447 cm-1 associated to pyridine coordinated with Lewis acids, and which are the same bands observed previously for TS-1. With the more hydrophobic samples synthesized in F- media, the same bands but with a lower intensity are observed. Since none of these IR bands were observed with the pure silica Beta zeolite, we concluded that they are associated with pyridine coordinated with Ti.
The nature of the Lewis acid sites in Ti-zeolites is still a matter of discussion. Some authors believe that the observed Lewis acidity in Ti-zeolites is due to the presence of Ti(IV) in framework positions, 386,389 while others claim that the Lewis acidity is associated to Ti4+ ions within framework defects. We can make use of these hypotheses to explain differences in the intensity of the IR bands. Thus, since Ti in defects would be more accessible to pyridine than Ti incorporated in framework positions, one may assume that Ti-Beta synthesized in OH- media should have a larger concentration of Ti in defect sites than the sample synthesized in F- media. On the other hand, taking into account that pyridine was desorbed at 150 C and 10-4 Torr before recording the IR spectra, and also that the two samples have the same Ti content, one can conclude that the Ti-Beta synthesized in OH- media has stronger Lewis sites than those for the sample prepared in F- media. The observed differences in acid strength could explain the larger extent of epoxide ring opening that occurs in absence of H2O2, with Ti-Beta synthesized in OH- media. On the other hand, when in the presence of H2O2, it can be assumed that the epoxide ring opening occurs in Ti-zeolites through the transition state shown in Scheme 31.
Scheme 31
In this case, the different Lewis acidity in the two samples can also explain the higher epoxide ring opening of Ti-Beta OH-, in methanol and H2O2. Indeed, the higher the acid strength of the Ti Lewis sites, the higher will be the inductive effect and the acidity of the proton of the hydroperoxo group coordinated to the metallic atom.
It becomes then clear that one should not discuss about Ti-Beta and any other Ti-zeolite without taking into account factors such as Ti-content, synthesis procedure, and their implications on hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and acid strength/Ti-distribution.
Even if most of the work in Ti-zeolites has been done with TS-1, TS-2, and Ti-Beta, other large pore Ti-zeolites have been prepared by direct synthesis. Among them we can mention Ti-ZSM-12, Ti-ITQ-7 and Ti-MCM-22. Ti-ZSM-12, a unidimensional zeolite, has been described using hexamethylene-bis-(diethylmethylammonium hydroxide) as SDA. 390 Ti-ITQ-7 is a tridimensional large pore zeolite in which small amounts of Ti were introduced with low efficiency. 391,392 A much more efficient synthesis that allows the introduction of higher Ti contents and with higher intrinsic activity has been described and involves the synthesis of Ti-Ge-ITQ-7 zeolite. 393-395 Very recently, Ti-MWW (Ti-MCM-22) has been prepared by direct synthesis and after acid leaching of part of the Ti, the resulting sample shows high activity and selectivity for oxidation of small molecules. 396,397 Finally, a delaminated Ti-ferrierite named as Ti-ITQ-6 has been synthesized with external surface areas  600 m2 g-1. 398 This material can carry out oxidation reactions with H2O2 and organic peroxides. Moreover, the delaminated accessible structure allows the reaction of bulky organic reactants that can hardly diffuse in the internal pores of zeolites.
Other large pore zeolites such as FAU, MAZ, LTL and delaminated ITQ-2 zeolite, 399 MOR, and MWW396 have been prepared by postsynthesis methods.
8. Mechanism of Electrophilic Oxidations Catalyzed by Ti-Zeolites
To elucidate a reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis, it helps very much to stablish analogies with homogeneous systems, for which reaction mechanisms at the molecular level are easier to study. If one applies this methodology to electrophilic oxidations, some trends appear clear and they are summarized as follows: 400
(a) Complexes that catalyze the nonradical epoxidation of simple alkenes with H2O2 or alkyl hydroperoxides are almost always Lewis acids.
Scheme 32
(b) Complexes containing a transition metal with an empty d-shell, as for instance Mo(VI), Ti(IV), Re(VII) in CH3ReO3, are effective Lewis acids.
(c) In all known peroxo complexes of the group IVVII transition metals, the peroxo moiety is bonded side-on.
(d) Besides a three-membered ring (metallodioxirane structures), oxygen can be transferred smoothly from five-membered ring structures.
(e) Metal-catalyzed epoxidation and epoxidation by peracids experience similar solvent effects: polar solvents enhance the reaction rate except for strongly coordinating or protic solvents which slow or completely inhibit the reaction.
In the case of oxidations using Ti-zeolites, any valid mechanism should also consider the effects of solvents, and the fact that the active species possesses Brnsted acidity and ion exchange properties. The reaction mechanisms for three types of important reactions occurring with Ti-zeolites are described in the following sections.
a.Olefin Epoxidation. Olefins are epoxidized in the presence of Ti-zeolites using diluted H2O2 as oxidant. The absence of products derived from radical epoxidations (allylic alcohols) and the stereospecificity of the reaction (cis-olefins produce cis-epoxides) indicate the nonradical nature of the epoxidations occurring on Ti-zeolites. The different reaction mechanisms proposed for the epoxidation of olefins with H2O2 with Ti-zeolites are indicated in Scheme 32.341,353,401
By analogy with soluble complexes of Mo(VI), W(VI), and Ti(IV) mechanisms a and b in Scheme 32 imply an electrophillic attack of titanodioxirane and hydroperoxy species to the olefin. Mechanism b in Scheme 32 can occur through two intermediates, and there is discussion about which oxygen is transferred to the olefin. Mechanism c in Scheme 32 implies the direct coordination of the double bond to the Ti center. However, it appears that in the presence of H2O, alcohols, and other oxygenated molecules it is not very probable that Ti(IV) could coordinate with an olefin that is a much weaker coordinating ligand.
In contrast to homogeneously catalyzed epoxidation in which the reaction rate is mainly governed by electronic factors, steric factors having only a minor influence, in the case of epoxidation catalyzed by Ti-zeolites, steric factors such as the bulkiness of substituents attached to the CC double bond can sometimes dominate.353,402,403
b.Alcohol Oxidations. As was said above, the interaction of Ti centers and H2O2 in the presence of a solvent of the ROH type can generate a five-member cyclic structure that can be considered the active species. Taking this into account, it may very well occur that in the presence of other alcohols similar structures are formed. These type of structures have an electrophilic character owing to the presence of a partial positive charge on the oxygen situated far away from the Ti and which is activated by the formation of the hydrogen bond. However, the oxidation of alcohols requires activation of the CH bond, and, consequently, the reaction intermediate should have a structure in where the CH bond is weakened.
In the case of alcohol oxidations by W complexes, Jacobson et al. 404 have proposed the species shown in Scheme 33 as potential intermediate.
Scheme 33
In this intermediate, the heterolytic rupture of the CH occurs concurrently with the nucleophilic attack of the hydride ion on the most distant oxygen. Taking the above structure as a model, Esposito et al. 405 have proposed a similar intermediate for the oxidation of alcohols with H2O2 with TS-1 (Scheme 34).
Scheme 34
A radical mechanism having as key intermediate the structure shown in Scheme 35 has also been proposed for the oxidation of alcohols. 406
Scheme 35
In both types of mechanisms, the alcohol coordinates to the Ti before hydride or hydrogen abstraction takes place. This can explain the observed differences in the rate of oxidation between 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol (the latter reacting 10 times more slowly) in the TS-1,406 and consequently none of the two mechanisms can be rejected. Nevertheless, the high selectivities to aldehydes favor the two-electron process. Otherwise, aldehydes would undergo a fast oxidation to carboxylic acid derivatives. It is interesting to notice that alcohol oxidation by neutral or anionic tungsten or molybdenum peroxo complexes is also widely accepted as a two-electron process. 407 The molybdenum picolinate N-oxide complex MoO(O2)2(pico)- is especially selective to aldehydes. It is not clear to what extent heterolytic alcohol oxidation by peroxo complexes should still be considered an electrophilic reaction, since it is commonly said that less electrophillic reagents are needed to effect alcohol oxidation compared to alkene epoxidation.
c.Alkanes Oxidation. TS-1 is an active zeolite for the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. 408 For this medium pore titanosilicate, the reaction takes place on the outer surface of the solid particles on Lewis acid sites. Sulfation of the catalyst increases the acidity of external Lewis acid sites and results in an increase in the catalytic activity. Addition of water also causes an increase in the selectivity of the process, probably due to the competitive adsorption on the active sites. The maximum conversion was 17% with a selectivity to propene of 74%.408
It was found independently by two groups 409,410 that TS-1 was able to oxidize alkanes to secondary alcohols and ketones. To explain such results, Huybrechts et al. proposed the radical mechanism, which is very similar to that proposed for oxidation with vanadium complexes (Scheme 36). 411
Scheme 36
A radical mechanism for this reaction was supported by the fact that the oxidation of cis-1,3-dimethylcyclopentane on TS-1 proceeds without any stereoselectivity. 412 The formed radicals, however, have a very short lifetime or their movements are highly restricted in the pores of TS-1 since their rearrangement is not observed. A radical mechanism was also consistent with the low reactivity of the terminal carbons. On the other hand, a radical mechanism for oxidation of alkanes implies the formation of Ti3+OO• radicals, that require the reduction of Ti4+, something that is improbable owing to the low redox potential of [Ti4+/Ti3+] (0.06 eV). Nevertheless, if the energy of formation of the OH of the TiOOH is high and comparable to the CH energy, the radical mechanism could take place. 413 Also at the relatively high temperature used by Huybrechts et al., 409,414 the participation of radicals and molecular oxygen in the process can be important.
It is remarkable that Clerici, 410,415 by working under milder conditions, obtained somewhat different results than Huybrechts et al. (see Table 3).
Table 3. n-Hexane Oxidation with H2O2 on TS-1

Clerici observed that the addition of radical chain inhibitor or chloroalkanes did not influence reaction rates or product distributions.410 Following this, a free-radical chain mechanism can be considered less likely, at least, under the milder conditions used by Clerici.410 Evidence for the electrophillic nature of the process was obtained from the oxidation of 1- chlorohexane and methyl heptanoate, in which oxygenation occurred preferentially on the remote secondary CH bond.409
It is not yet completely clear what the mechanism of the oxygen insertion reaction is, and whether it consists of two consecutive one electron steps or a single two electron step. It should be taken into account that reactions involving a hydrogen abstraction step followed by a fast recombination of radicals in a so-called solvent cage are known. 416 Such solvent cage reactions are also not affected by radical chain inhibitors or chloroalkanes. This solvent cage mechanism would be supported in the case of TS-1 in which a large isotope effect (KH/KD = 4.1) was observed.410
9. Other Transition Metal Containing Zeolites and Other Microporous Molecular Sieves
The very interesting catalytic results obtained with Ti-zeolites acted as a booster for the synthesis of zeolites containing other transition metals within framework positions. Similarities between vanadium and titanium in their catalytic peroxo chemistry have influenced the synthesis of vanadium silicalites. The known coordination chemistry of vanadium does not rule out their ability to occupy tetrahedral lattice positions in a silicate. However, the usual coordination geometry of vanadium (IV) is square pyramidal or distorted octahedral. Compounds containing tetrahedral vanadium (IV) are rare. Tetrahedral coordination is also rare for vanadium (III), one example being the VCl4- ion that occurs in some salts. Nevertheless, it has been claimed the synthesis of vanadium-containing MFI and MEL silicalites starting from V(III) or V(IV) salts. 417 It has been reported346 that vanadium-containing zeolites and silicalites prepared using VCl3 underwent a structural collapse leading to the formation of crystobalite after calcination at 550 C in air. This did not occur if the calcination was done in H2 atmosphere. The structure collapse can be due to the oxidation of V(III) or V(IV) species very well dispersed in the zeolite matrix. Stable materials were obtained when the synthesis was done in the absence of sodium, using vanadyl(IV) sulfate and avoiding oxidation of V(IV) during gel preparation and crystallization. 418,419
Other zeolite structures such as ZSM-48 and V-NCL-1 have been synthesized, and the resulting materials were stable after several calcinations in air. 420,421
The existence of VOSi bonds in vanadium-containing zeolites has been postulated from the presence of the IR and Raman band at 960 cm-1, as well as by a direct correlation between vanadium content and unit cell expansion. 422 Adsorption of NH3, pyridine, and acetonitrile shows the presence of Lewis and Brnsted acids in V-MFI and V-MEL that were not present in the pure silica zeolites. 423,424
ESR spectroscopy gives information about the state of the vanadium in the zeolite. Thus, ESR spectra of V(IV)-containing samples show anisotropic hyperfine splitting caused by the 51V nucleus with or without the presence of an underlying broad singlet. The singlet is thought to arise from vanadium-rich phases or oligomeric species, while the hyperfine pattern originates from isolated ions. The values of the ESR parameters fall within the range reported for square pyramidal vanadyl complexes in an oxygen environment. However, vanadyl species cannot be located at a regular tetrahedral framework site and they may exist as a framework satellite.
In situ reflectance spectroscopy has been used for studying the coordination environment of vanadium during the synthesis of VAPO-5. 42551V NMR spectroscopy is also useful for elucidating the local symmetry of V(V) species. This technique shows that in most calcined vanadium silicalites, V(V) is present in tetrahedral coordination. 426,427
It appears then that it is possible to prepare vanadium-containing zeolites in which isolated vanadium species may be connected to the framework at defect sites forming framework satellites. These vanadium atoms are accessible to molecules that can enter into the pores, and can apparently change its coordination and oxidation state reversibly.
Chromium would be an interesting Lewis acid that could carry out oxidation reactions if it were tetrahedrally incorporated in zeolites. It has been claimed isomorphous framework silicon substitutions by chromium in MFI structure. 428-430 However, no effect of chromium on unit cell parameters were found, indicating that chromium species are not really in the framework or the efficiency of chromium incorporation in the framework is very low.. 431,432 Zn, however, has been incorporated in Beta zeolite, and it occupies preferentially three-member rings. This material presents Brnsted acidity owing to charge compensation.
In the case of AlPO4 molecular sieves isomorphous substitutions with cobalt, vanadium, iron, chromium, manganese, and zinc have been well documented. Aluminophosphates molecular sieves containing Si, V, Co, and Mn have been synthesized using n-dipropylamine as a template. 433 The presence of these elements in framework positions considerably influences the physical and catalytic properties of the materials. By using the methylation of toluene and isomerization of m-xylene as test reactions, it was found that the product distribution of Si or metal substituted AlPO-11 is similar to that of zeolites.433 AlPO-11 not containing any heteroatom fails to exhibit any activity for these reactions, although it shows activity for less-demanding isobutanol dehydration. This study concludes that metal substitution on AlPO-11 introduces additional stronger acid sites by replacing framework Al3+ by divalent metal atoms. These sites are stronger than in the case of the Si-containing AlPO, but much weaker than those of zeolites.433 On the other hand, metal substituted AlPOs also exhibit activity in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and oxidation of benzylic alcohols, thus, demonstrating the redox properties imparted to the solid by the presence of framework metal sites.433
Isomorphic substitution of Al by Mn(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) in AlPO4-31 has been confirmed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. 434 In the case of MnAPO-31 UVVis and XANES spectra revealed the partial oxidation of some Mn atoms into Mn(III) in calcined samples, introducing redox centers in the solid. The presence of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites was studied by ammonia adsorption/desorption titration and the relative strength follows the order MnAPO-31 > CoAP-31 > ZnAPO-31. In contrast, Ti(IV) is not incorporated into the framework and the presence of TiO2 anatase was observed.434
Low levels of Co(II) can be incorporated into the framework of AlPOs substituting aluminum on tetrahedral positions as shown by UVVisible, near-IR, ESR, and 31P NMR techniques and EXAFS.305,435-441,442 During calcination in the presence of O2, tetrahedral cobalt (III) and strongly distorted tetrahedral cobalt (II) species are formed in CoAPOs. The oxidized species can be reduced back to tetrahedral cobalt (II) by calcination in H2.
A UVVis and FT-IR spectroscopic study combined with the use of probe adsorbates has suggested that there are two types of cobalt atoms in CoAPO-18. 443,444 Besides tetrahedrally coordinated framework Co atoms, there are coordinatively unsaturated Co(II) Lewis acid centers. Approximately one-half of the tetrahedral framework Co atoms form bridged hydroxy Co(OH)P groups that introduce Brnsted acidity to the solid and that are able to undergo oxidation to framework Co(III). 445
A well-crystalyzed sample of CoAPO-37 having faujasite structure has been prepared. 446 The incorporation of Co in the framework introduces Brnsted and Lewis acid sites as shown by pyridine titration recorded by IR spectroscopy. Catalytic tests reveal that CoAPO-37 has activity for 1-butene and m-xylene isomerization, indicating that the acid sites of CoAPO-37 are stronger than those of SAPO-37 and similar to those of Y zeolites.446
VAPO-5 has been synthesized with well-dispersed monomeric vanadyl(IV) species which were oxidized to vanadium(V) after calcination in air at 773 K. The presence of well-dispersed, immobile vanadium species was taken as evidence of the location of the metal in framework positions. 447,448 Those authors assumed, on the basis of elemental analysis, that vanadium(IV) substituted phosphorus (V). However, Rigutto et al. 449 synthesized VAPO-5 in F- media using vanadyl(IV) sulfate as the vanadium source. By means of 51V NMR spectroscopy, it has been shown that at low vanadium contents the dominant species in calcined materials is a square pyramidal or distorted octahedral vanadyl(V) species, consistent with a phosphate environment.
Chromium has also been introduced in AlPO4's in octahedral positions and/or as framework connected ions. Diffuse reflectance UVVisible spectroscopy seems to indicate that octahedral chromium(III) are present in as-synthesized CrAPO-5 which is oxidized to tetrahedral chromium(VI) upon calcination. 450,451 The incorporation of Cr3+ in AlPO4-16 framework is also uncertain, and two species are observed: clusters similar to the bulk Cr2O3 oxide and isolated Cr3+ ions in strongly distorted octahedral coordination. 435
Cr-substituted aluminophosphates (CrAPO-5 and CrAPO-11) in which chromium atoms occupy internal framework positions have been hydrothermally synthesized and found selective and reusable solids for the catalytic oxidation of benzylic and cyclic alcohols using oxygen or tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidants. 452 Evidence was provided in support that the oxidation essentially takes place within the micropores through a mechanism involving a oxochromium alkoxide. This active species undergoes a heterolytically β-hydrogen elimination followed by reoxidation of Cr(IV) to Cr(VI).452 Using tert-butyl hydroperoxide, high selectivities of the oxidizing reagent (>88%) and substrate (>89%) toward the ketone were observed. The CrAPO-5 catalyzed oxidation of alcohols with O2 gives also the corresponding ketones with 7297% selectivity at 2678% conversion when only 10 mol % of tert-butyl hydroperoxide was added.452
A study aimed at characterizing and determining the activity of framework Cr atoms incorporated into silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves has been undertaken. 453 Compared to a catalyst in which Cr has been supported on SAPO-11, XPS and diffuse reflectance UVVis spectroscopy indicates that approximately 70% of Cr atoms are in the +VI oxidation state. After hydrogen reduction at 550 C, the distribution of Cr atoms was approximately 40% as Cr(VI) and 60% as Cr(III). This reduction decreases the number of strong Brnsted and strong and medium Lewis acid sites of CrAPSO-11 by a factor of 2. These results seem to indicate that partially unsaturated Cr(VI) in the neighborhood of POH groups may act as strong Lewis sites and may generate strong Brnsted acid sites by Lewis enhancement of Brnsted acidity. In comparison, the main Cr species present in a sample of Cr-supported SAPO-11 was Cr(III) and reduction was easier. All the available data support as previously reported by Chen and Sheldon 454 that Cr atoms are incorporated into the framework of the molecular sieve.453
In general, it can be said that the thermal stability of the metal ALPOs (MeAPOs) is lower than for zeolites and upon calcination a significant portion of the metal can migrate from framework to nonframework positions. The formation of nonframework metal can be complete upon succesive cycles of calcination. The presence of nonframework metals favors the leaching of the metal when the catalytic oxidation is carried out in the liquid phase.
A titanoaluminophosphate in which the titanium atoms occupy octahedral framework positions has been obtained by adapting the hydrothermal synthesis of VPI-5 aluminophosphate in the presence of di-n-butylamine. 455
Crystalline vanadium silicates (Si/V 79161) with MEL structure may have a single vanadium species according to the 51V NMR wherein a single peak at 573 ppm having a width of 50 ppm is observed. 456 These spectroscopic parameters correspond to tetrahedrally coordinated V4+, thus, ruling out the presence of V2O5 clusters in these solids. A linear increase in the intensity of the ESR peaks with the vanadium content was also observed. The solids possess both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites as evidenced by the pyridine adsorption method. These vanadium silicates oxidizes toluene to a mixture of cresols, benzylic alcohol, and benzaldehyde.456 The internal location of the V ions inside the channel system of the MEL zeotype was demonstrated from the differences in the oxidation rates for xylene isomers.456
Tin has been claimed to be introduced in framework positions of MFI, ZSM-12, ZSM-48, and Beta zeolite. 457-463 In zeolites, Sn tends to be located in satellite positions, i.e., in defects. With a sample of Sn-Beta synthesized with enriched 119Sn, it has been found by 119Sn NMR that the metal adopts a 6-fold coordination when the solid is hydrated, and changes to a four coordination upon dehydration.463 The activation of the Sn-zeolites is critical. Overheating during calcination brings about structure stabilization and at the same time a partial ejection of framework Sn occurs. Calcination in shallow bed at temperatures not higher than 773 K allows the Sn to stay attached to the framework in tetrahedral coordination.459,464,465
10. Catalytic Activity of Microporous Molecular Sieves with Framework Transition Metals for Oxidation Reactions Using Peroxides
a.Epoxidation of Olefins. Ti-zeolites and more specifically TS-1 have been the most successful transition metal containing zeolites from a catalytic point of view. The use of H2O2 is environmentally adequate, but the process is complicated by its inmiscibility with organic solvents. The presence of accompanying water that can promote hydrolysis can also be a limitation. TS-1 and Ti-Beta catalysts have shown to be active and selective for olefin epoxidation with H2O2. Ti-Beta, with a lower intrinsic activity than TS-1, can epoxidize bulkier olefins than TS-1 owing to the large pore diameter of the former. The use of TS-1 for production of propylene oxide would allow the use of H2O2 instead of the organic hydroperoxide used in ARCO and SHELL processes. It has to be remarked, however, that while H2O2 gives a higher flexibility, the use of the organic peroxides in ARCO and SHELL processes can also be economically interesting if there is a market for the products formed. Recently, Sumitomo has presented a new technology in which the organic peroxide (cumene hydroperoxide) is produced in the plant by reoxidation of the alcohol formed when transferring the oxygen from cumene hydroperoxide to the propylene. 466-472
In the case of propylene oxidation with H2O2 at 313 K using methanol as solvent, 95% of the H2O2 is reacted with 90% selectivity to propylene oxide. The byproducts formed are mainly propylene glycol and its monomethyl ethers. These reactions are catalyzed by residual Brnsted acidity or even by the Lewis acidity of the Ti. Therefore, improvements in selectivity are obtained by partially neutralizing catalyst acidity. Obviously, the catalyst deactivates with time of use.333 This deactivation is mainly due to the strong adsorption of glycol on Ti that competes with reactants for adsorption sites. The catalyst can be regenerated by eliminating the adsorbed products by calcination or by washing with alcohols, or by refluxing the catalyst with dilute H2O2. 473 EniChem has designed a new process for the one-step epoxidation of propylene to the epoxide using TS-1 catalyst. The technology, based on a slurry process, is highly selective and generates a limited amount of byproducts. 474 Degussa has also announced a process for the epoxidation of propylene to the epoxide.
The TS-1 oxidation of larger alkenes is diffusion-limited and then there is one opportunity for Ti-Beta which has larger pores to be more active than TS-1. In this sense, Tatsumi et al. 475 showed that during oxidation of n-paraffins with H2O2 in the presence of TS-1 catalyst, the rate of oxidation decreased when increasing chain length due to diffusional limitations. In the case of n-olefins, Corma et al.361 found that when increasing the chain length of n-olefins at least up to C12, the turnover number (mol/mol Ti h) for epoxidation increased with TS-1, but selectivity to epoxide decreased. In the case of Ti-Beta, turnover number also increased, but this increase was larger than with TS-1. In other words, it seems that Ti-Beta, especially when properly synthesized and subject to a postsynthesis treatment, 476 gives higher activities and selectivities than TS-1 for olefins with 8 or more carbons. However, the preferred solvent for Ti-Beta is acetonitrile instead of methanol which in turn is more suitable for TS-1. An example of the benefit of the larger pores of Ti-Beta for the epoxidation of long chain n-olefins and bulky olefins corresponds to the epoxidation of methyl oleate and linalool for the production of chemicals and fine chemicals. 362,477
Ti-Beta zeolites within a wide range of Ti and Al contents were used for the selective oxidation with H2O2 of n-hexane to ketones, cyclohexane to adipic acid, octanol to octanoic acid, cyclopentanone to glutaric acid, and the side chain oxidation of toluene. 478n-Hexane conversions of 210% were achieved, the products formed being the 2- and 3-alcohols and ketones. A 25% yield of adipic acid with 55% selectivity was obtained for the oxidation of cyclohexane with Ti-Beta and H2O2. The oxidation of toluene gave 19% yield of side chain oxidation in a total selectivity of 76% with nearly equal amounts of benzyl alcohol, aldehyde, and acid. Ti-Beta was much superior than TS-1 for oxidation to acids. TS-1, on the other hand, was a good catalyst for conversion of allyl chloride to epichlorohydrin with diluted H2O2. The conversion of peroxide was 80% with an epoxide selectivity of 90%. 479 α-Methylstyrene is converted to acetophenone using TS-1 and TS-2. 480
Novel layered zeolites with a very large external surface area and a reduced microporosity have been obtained by delamination of layered zeolite precursors before calcination. 481 For instance, ITQ-6 has been obtained by delamination of the layered precursor of ferrierite, and it has a very large surface area that is accessible to large reactants. It has been possible to introduce directly by synthesis Ti atoms in framework positions. It was demonstrated that Ti occupies framework positions. The resulting Ti/ITQ-6 is active and selective for the 1-hexene epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide. Ti/ITQ-6 remains active after repeated reaction/calcination cycling.394,398
b.Ammoximation of Ketones. Ammoximation of cyclohexanone to cyclohexanone oxime is carried out by reacting cyclohexanone with hydroxylamine sulfate. This process generates one mole of (NH4)2SO4 per mole of the oxime formed. The cyclohexanone oxime is used to produce caprolactam. EniChem has found that TS-1 is able to catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and ammonium hydroxide to form in situ hydroxylamine that subsequently reacts with cyclohexanone to form the corresponding oxime (Scheme 37). 482
Scheme 37
Nitrogen and nitrous oxide are also formed in very low amounts. Other byproducts formed from homogeneous reactions are nitrocyclohexane, (cyclohexenyl)cyclohexanone, and cyclohexanone azine. 483 Some catalyst deactivation is observed due to the dissolution of the zeolite in the alkaline reaction media. EniChem and Sumitomo have presented a new process for the production of caprolactam that involves the use of TS-1 for producing the oxime from cyclohexanone. The reaction takes place in a continuous stirred tank reactor in tert-butyl alcohol as solvent. Kim et al. 484 reported that the activity of TS-1 for the H2O2 ammoxidation of cyclohexanone depended on crystallite size, titanium concentration, and the mode of addition of the peroxide. TS-1, Ti-ZSM-48, and Ti-Al-Beta were tested in the ammoximation of cyclohexanone and hydroxy aromatic ketones. 485 Ti-Beta shows catalytic properties similar to TS-1, only using a large excess of NH4OH and methanol as a solvent, because of its hydrophilic character. We have found that when hydrophobic Ti-Beta zeolites are produced and C3C4 alcohols are used as solvent, the catalytic behavior of Ti-Beta approaches to that of TS-1.379
Ti-ZSM-48 owing to its monodimensional channel system gives poor catalytic results. However, Ti-mordenite prepared by a secondary synthesis method from dealuminated mordenite (Si/Al = 300) gives good ammoximation results. 486
c. Oxidation of Heterocompounds. TS-1 is a good catalyst to carry out the oxidation of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine with H2O2 to the corresponding nitroxyl compounds with 96% yields. 487 Some worse results were reported by Horchler et al. 488 during the oxidation of heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazole by TS-1 and H2O2, with yields of 34% and selectivities of 46.5%.
Aniline can be oxidized with H2O2 giving a rather complex reaction mixture114 when using Ti-Beta and Ti-mesoporous materials (Scheme 38). 489,490
Scheme 38
The reaction scheme shows the formation of phenylhydroxylamine, nitrosobenzene, and nitrobenzene in a series of consecutive reactions. The condensation of unreacted aniline with nitrosobenzene results in the formation of azobenzene, while reaction of hydroxylamine with nitrosobenzene produces azoxybenzene.
Na- and/or K-doped TS-1 catalyst has been used for the selective oxidation of diethylamine to diethylhydroxylamine with diluted hydrogen peroxide. 491-493 The selectivity to diethylhydroxylamine is highest for the K-doped TS-1, with a K/Ti atomic ratio of 1.492 With the optimum catalyst, a selectivity to diethylhydroxylamine of 92% was measured with a H2O2/(CH3CH2)2NH ratio of 0.9. Since Ti catalyzes the oxidation of both diethylamine and diethylhydroxylamine, the results of the catalytic activity have been interpreted as reflecting the neutralization of the Lewis acid sites, thus disfavoring the adsorption of the weakest base.492
Tertiary amines are oxidized to the corresponding nitrogen oxides. Tosyl hydrazone undergo CN oxidative bond cleavage with H2O2 to give high yields of the corresponding carbonyl compounds. It has been postulated that for this reaction, oxaziridines would be formed as intermediate compounds that would be oxidized to carbonyl compounds. 494
Hydroperoxides and peracids are known to oxidize organic sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones. However, a more friendly process involves TS-1 and TS-2 molecular sieves which efficiently catalyze the oxidation of thioethers to the corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones using diluted H2O2 as oxidant (Scheme 39).339
Scheme 39
When bulkier sulfides are to be reacted, Ti-Beta and Ti-MCM-41 give a better performance than TS-1 using either H2O2 or organic peroxides. 495
This type of reaction has been applied to the elimination of sulfur-containing compounds in the kerosene fraction. 496,497 In this case, Ti-Beta is used in the presence of H2O2 and acetonitrile as a solvent to form sulfones from sulfides and thiophenes. The more polar sulfones are washed out with water from the kerosene fraction.
Small and medium sizes silanes can be oxidized at room temperature to the corresponding silanols by H2O2 using Ti-Beta as catalyst with high conversions and excellent selectivity (Scheme 40).402 The major advantage compared to homogeneous catalysis is the absence of disiloxane formation due to steric restrictions. In contrast, TS-1 was found inactive for this reaction due to the lack of diffusion of reagents through the medium size pores.
Scheme 40
d.Hydroxylation of Phenol. Dihydroxybenzenes are largely used today as intermediate chemicals. They are produced by decomposition of diisopropyl benzene hydroperoxides, or by hydroxylation of phenol in strong acid media (ClO4H). Hydroquinone (p-dihydroxybenzene) was also produced by the oxidation of aniline using manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid (Scheme 41). This was then followed by reduction using typically Fe/HCl.
Scheme 41
The last process gives a very poor atom economy while producing a large amount of waste. 430,498 A more convenient procedure for production of catechol (o-dihydroxybenzene) and hydroquinone p-dihydroxybenzene has been developed that makes use of TS-1 as a catalyst and H2O2 as hydroxylating agent. High conversions and selectivities are obtained (Scheme 42). 499
Scheme 42
Owing to a combination of pore dimensions and solvent used, the catechol/hydroquinone ratio can be varied between 0.5 and 1.3. In aqueous acetone, the ratio is 1.3, while hydroquinone formation prevails in methanol. At elevated phenol concentrations, even in methanol, that ratio is close to one. For observing shape selectivity based on product diffusion, there is a catalyst parameter that plays an important role, namely, zeolite crystallite size. Smaller crystal size increases diffusivity, increasing therefore the reaction rate. 500 Small crystallites have a higher external to internal surface ratio and then nonselective reactions occurring on the external surface should become more important. Following this, it was claimed that catechol was mainly produced at the external surface of TS-1 crystallite, 501 modifying the expected catechol-to-hydroquinone ratio, and producing more tars. Moreover, it was found that acetone was able to dissolve the tars formed on the external surface, while methanol was not. These results allow the explanation of the influence of the solvent on the catechol/hydroquinone (C/H) ratio by assuming that in methanol, catechol is rapidly formed on the external surface while hydroquinone formed inside the pores is formed more slowly giving high ratios C/H in the first moments. Following this, when the surface sites are poisoned by the tars formed, the catechol formed at the external surface strongly decreases producing a decrease of the C/H ratio in the products. In acetone, however, catechol was always the main component through the course of the reaction owing to the solubility of surface tars by acetone.
Another catalyst variable, especially important for phenol hydroxylation was the presence or not of amorphous material in the TS-1, and especially TiO2. The presence of TiO2 anatase and/or amorphous titanosilicates significantly decreases the yields of dihydroxybenzenes. Concentration of catalyst and reaction temperature have an important effect on yields, besides the obvious kinetic effect. When the concentration of TS-1 increases from 1 to 4 wt %, yield increases from 65 to 82% and tar production decreases. 502 Optimum temperature is in the range 80100 C for which dihydroxybenzene selectivity is still high and tar selectivity is low. 502,503
The presence or not of a solvent and its nature is also an important variable. Acetone was seen to dissolve the tars, while acetonitrile has a negative influence. 504 Water was found to be the best solvent. 505
Ti-Al-Beta and Ti-Beta zeolite prepared by direct synthesis gave equimolecular amounts of the two isomers,366 and give better results than Ti-Beta or Ti-mordenite prepared by postsynthesis methods.505 Ti-Al-mordenites prepared by hydrothermal and secondary synthesis gave also low yields for benzene hydroxylation. 506-508
It would be very interesting to produce the direct hydroxylation of benzene with H2O2. When this reaction is carried out in the presence of TS-1 as catalyst, phenol is formed as the primary product, but conversion should be kept low to avoid formation of the secondary catechol and hydroquinone products. While acetone and methanol can be used as solvents, it has been found that the hydroxylation of benzene without any organic solvent, i.e., in a triphase system, is 20 times faster than when using acetone or acetonitrile as solvents. 509 It is evident that for this reaction the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the catalyst should be of paramount importance. Thus, a more hydrophobic catalyst should favor the adsorption of organophilic reagents (benzene) toward other more polar ones (H2O2, acetone).
In the case of the hydroxylation of substituted benzenes, electron-withdrawing groups, such as chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, benzonitrile, benzaldehyde, and benzoic acid, reduce the rate of hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, indicating the electrophilicity of the oxidant species,502 and very large amounts of catalyst are needed to observe some conversion. 510 While electron-donating groups should increase the rate of hydroxylation, the size of the substituents can affect the diffusion of the reactant, and a decrease in conversion may occur in more activated molecules.410 It is with these bulkier molecules that large pore Ti-zeolites could be of more interest. Attention should be paid in Ti-mesoporous materials since a leaching of Ti in the presence of H2O2 occurs.
e.Oxidation of Alcohols. TS-1 and Ti-Beta catalyze the selective oxidation of alcohols with diluted H2O2 under mild conditions.406,511-514 Ti-Beta can also oxidize alcohols using organic peroxides as oxidants.513,514 Oxidation of secondary alcohols give high yields of the corresponding ketone, while primary alcohols produce the aldehyde. Tertiary alcohols are not oxidized but converted to alkylhydroperoxides.406 When a double bond and hydroxy group are both present in the same molecule, TS-1 is chemoselective for the epoxidation of the double bond. 515-519
11. Oxidation Activity of Microporous Molecular Sieves with Metals Other than Ti
Besides Ti-zeolites, other transition metal-substituted zeolites are also active and selective for carrying out oxidations in liquid phase using either H2O2 or organic peroxides as oxidants. For instance, V-MEL silicalite is active for alkane oxidation and phenol hydroxylation. However, selectivities and H2O2 yields are lower than for TS-1.424 V-MFI also catalyzes phenol hydroxylation and toluene oxidation with H2O2 giving a similar product distribution than V-MEL, but with lower peroxide efficiencies. V-silicalites have a higher activity than Ti-silicalites for the oxyfunctionalization of primary carbon atoms in alkanes and toluene. This indicates a more pronounced homolytic tendency of the active complex.
Vanadium mesoporous silicalites, either amorphous or ordered, have also been synthesized, showing activity for different reactions. However, they are very unstable when using H2O2 as oxidant. 520 In general, it can be said that under liquid-phase oxidation some of the vanadium is leached from the lattice, and the homogeneous reaction occurring can mask the results from the solid catalyst.319
VAPO-5 was found to catalyze selectively the epoxidation of allylic alcohols and benzylic oxidations with TBHP,449 with higher eficiency than VAPO-11. On the basis of 51V NMR studies on the interaction of vanadium species in VAPO-5 with TBHP a model was proposed for the catalytic sites of VAPO-5 (Scheme 43).
Scheme 43
In the case of Cr substituted molecular sieves, H2O2 or alkyl hydroperoxides led to breakdown of the SiOCr or AlOCr bonds in substituted zeolites or AlPOs and to the leaching of some chromium in solution. Thus, most of the catalytic results that assumed that reaction was occurring in the micropores have to be reinterpreted by taking into account that an important part of the catalysis occurs with the leached chromium in liquid phase. 521
CoAPOs have also used for liquid-phase oxidations of alkanes and alkylaromatics. Under these conditions, Co may leach if working in basic media, in the presence of organic acids or in the presence of strong polar solvents. 522,523
Sn-silicalite is active for the hydroxylation of phenol in dilute H2O2 as oxidant. A direct correlation between the activity and Sn content up to about 2.4 Sn per unit cell was observed with a ratio of catechol to hydroquinone of 1.6. Among the different solvents used water was found the most efficient. The isolated Sn(IV) centers tend to coordinate strongly with solvent molecules such as acetone and acetonitrile reducing the solvolysis of SiOSn bonds. Sn-ZSM-12 owing to its larger pores catalyzes the hydroxylation of toluene, m-cresol, and m-xylene, as well as the oxidation of methyl substituents. The product distribution and the ability of Sn-ZSM-12 to oxidize naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene suggest that the Sn4+ ions are located within the channels of the molecular sieves. 458,524 Sn-AlBeta and dealuminated Sn-AlBeta were active for the oxidation of m-cresol and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with moderate selectivities and H2O2 selectivities.461
Al-free Sn-Beta obtained by direct synthesis is able to catalyze the BaeyerVilliger oxidation of cyclic ketones with diluted H2O2 with good activities and very high selectivity to the corresponding lactone.463 When a double bond is also present in the reactant cyclic ketone, a very high chemoselectivity for the BaeyerVilliger reaction is observed with Sn-Beta catalyst (Table 4).
Table 4. Baeyer-Villiger Oxidation of Dihydrocarvone Using Different Oxidation Systemsb
aUp to 100% were opening products of the epoxide.bTaken from ref 463.
The Sn located in the framework of Beta acts as a Lewis acid coordinating the ketone on the Sn atoms. For studying the reaction mechanism on this catalyst, methylcyclohexanone labeled with 18O was reacted. The BaeyerVilliger oxidation leads the incorporation of all labeled oxygen into the lactone product as carbonyl oxygen and none is present as ring oxygen. Thus, it was concluded that the BaeyerVilliger oxidation with H2O2 on Sn-Beta proceeds via a Criegee adducts, where H2O2 adds to the ketone activated by the Sn-Beta, and the formation of dioxiranes or carbonyl oxides as intermediates can be excluded. The complete mechanistic cycle proposed is presented in Figure 4.
Figure 4 Mechanism of BaeyerVilliger oxidation of 2-methyl-cyclohexanone catalyzed by SnBeta.
Sn-Beta also carries out the selective BaeyerVilliger oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids and shows the shape selectivity behavior associated to the pore diameter and internal void space of this zeolite.476
As reported earlier, the Oppenauer oxidation of alcohols by ketones is a very selective oxidation reaction when the molecule contains other groups susceptible to be oxidized. The opposite reaction, i.e., the reduction of carbonyl compounds by alcohols, is called the MeerweinPonndorfVerley reaction. Both types of reactions proceed via a complex in which both reactants are coordinated to a Lewis acid metal ion and a hydride transfer from the alcohol to the carbonyl group occurs (Scheme 44)
Scheme 44
Usually, metal tert-butoxides Lewis acids are used in these oxidations, one of the most common being Al(OiPr)3 and more recently other highly active aluminum alkoxides. 525 Therefore, molecular sieves containing Lewis acids should be appropriate catalysts for the MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reactions. We have seen previously that Lewis acids can be generated in zeolites from the extraframework Al species (EFAL), from exchanged cations, and by framework isomorphous substitutions. It is not surprising then that A, X, and Y zeolites exchanged or impregnated with alkali or alkaline earth cations have been used as catalyst for MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reactions in gas phase. 526-528 More interesting zeolite catalysts in the liquid-phase turned to be Al-Beta and Ti-Beta zeolites. The MeerweinPonndorfVerley reduction of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone to 4-tert-butylcyclohexanol, a classical transformation for this reaction type, can be catalyzed by Al-Beta and Ti-Beta zeolites. The high selectivity toward the thermodynamically less favored cis-alcohol was explained by zeolite shape selectivity, while the active sites were the extraframework aluminum and framework Ti. 529-531 In the case of Ti-Beta, the activity of the catalyst in the gas-phase reaction was found to correlate with the reduction potential of the alcohol, i.e., secondary alcohols are more active than primary alcohols. The selectivity was dependent on the polarity of the alcohol and the zeolite. An advantage of Ti-Beta in the gas-phase MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reactions is the high resistance to water and ammonia and the excellent stability.370 Beta zeolite with a large amount of extraframework aluminum acting as strong Lewis acids was very active as a MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer catalyst, but the selectivity was somewhat lower due to the presence of residual Brnsted acidity.
Very recently, Sn-Beta has been introduced as a MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer catalyst, based on the fact that it has a stronger Lewis acidity than Ti-Beta, but has not residual Brnsted acidity as it was the case of Al-Beta. The Sn-Beta zeolite allows one to work at low ratios alcohol/ketone and it gives higher activity and selectivity than either Ti-Beta or Al-Beta.476 It is interesting to notice that the Sn-Beta catalyst has been active and selective for oxidizing vainilline alcohol to vainilline by means of the MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reaction. 532
Very recently, the enantioselective synthesis of chiral alcohols by the MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reduction of the corresponding ketone has been achieved by a ruthenium complex of N-benzyl-(1R,2R)-()-norephedrine covalently tethered to silica. The ee was as high as 90% at 95% conversion. 533 This report could trigger research aimed at developing solid catalysts for enantioselective MeerweinPonndorfVerleyOppenauer reaction.
It appears to us that both micro and mesoporous substituted molecular sieves can be promising heterogeneous catalysts for the MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reactions provided that Lewis acidity and solid polarity can be adjusted to the requirements of a particular reaction. These polarity adjustments can be quite useful to control reactant concentrations within the pores and in this way to be able to work with reactant concentrations in the reaction media more adequate for industrial applications. Furthermore, the use of chiral auxiliaries, chiral ligands, and ship-in-a-bottle chiral complexes remain a field to be explored in more detail using molecular sieves as catalysts for MeerweinPonndorfVerley and Oppenauer reactions.
12. Selective Oxidations Using N2O.
Dehydroxylated and high-silica pentasil HZSM-5 zeolites have been used as catalysts for the selective oxidation of aromatic compounds including benzene, chlorobenzene, difluorobenzenes, phenol, styrene, and alkylbenzenes into their corresponding phenols using nitrous oxide as oxidant. 534,535 Steamed H/AlZSM-5 with strong Lewis acid sites is highly active for the oxidation of benzene with N2O.75 High phenol yields (7080% in the case of hydroxylation of benzene), high selectivities and regioselectivities were observed in all cases. The active sites were shown to be strong Lewis acidbase pair sites formed upon dehydroxylation of acidic HZSM-5 zeolite.75,534
Likewise, metal-containing zeolites have also been active for the hydroxylation of benzene using N2O as oxidant. Yields up to 16% with 99% selectively can be achieved at 400 C of reaction temperature. 536,537
The catalytic performance of the zeolite can be improved by incorporating small iron amounts into zeolites such as ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-23, mordenite, Beta, EU-1. Phenol yields of 2030% with selectivities 9097% have been achieved using iron-doped zeolites. 538,539 An optimal content and distribution of extraframework iron in Fe-silicates increases phenol selectivity, while high acidity increases benzene conversion, but lowers phenol yield. It has been observed that Lewis acids caused catalyst deactivation. 540 Even at low temperatures, N2O does not adsorb as such on the catalyst but undergoes decomposition. 541 Apparently, the same sites are responsible for benzene oxidation and N2O decomposition.540 Iron ions can be incorporated into the zeolite either during the synthesis or by some postsynthesis technique. 542 Considering a general composition of the catalyst: y El2O3: x Fe2O3: SiO2 in which y = 06.5 × 10-2 and x = 1.5 × 10-5  2 × 10-2, the incorporation of elements (El) in the general composition of the 2, 3, 4, and 5 periods of the periodic system has been reported.538 Aluminum-containing zeolites are more active, while the introduction of Na+ in the zeolite decreases the catalyst activity.538 Inert gas additive has been used to prevent reactor temperature increase due to the exothermicity of the reaction. However, in all cases catalyst deactivation with time on stream is one of the main obstacles for process commercialization.
Catalyst stability can be increased by hydrothermal treatment of the zeolite. 539,543 Key parameters for steam treatment are temperature, steam partial pressure, and time of treatment. It has been reported that a hydrothermal treatment at 700 C with 50% molar H2O for 2 h increases benzene conversion and catalyst stability when using ZSM-5.539 However, the optimal conditions of hydrothermal activation can be different for different types of catalysts. A further improvement in catalyst stability for benzene hydroxylation has been achieved by acid treatment of the zeolite after hydrothermal treatment. 544 Hydrothermal treatment of the catalyst is believed to remove aluminum from the framework of the zeolite but not from the bulk of the zeolite material.
13. Selective Oxidations Using Molecular Oxygen
There are some important unresolved selective oxidations that have been attempted using molecular sieve catalysts. Among them the oxyfunctionalization of alkanes and cycloalkanes is of particular importance.
Alkane oxidation with dioxygen through a radical mechanism is generally referred to as autoxidation and suffers from the relatively harsh conditions to be initiated and very low selectivity, due to secondary reactions of the primary products.
Although there have been major advances in the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons with molecular oxygen, the development of effective and selective methods for the catalytic functionalization of hydrocarbons still remains a major challenge in oxidation chemistry.276,277,545-551 It seems that alkane activation on a solid surface requires the presence of strong acid or basic sites. 481,552 In the following section, we will present some recent progress in the application of solid Lewis acids as catalysts using oxygen as oxidizing reagent.
a.Molecular Sieves as Catalysts. Enzymes such as cytochrome P-450 and non-heme, iron-based oxidase are able to carry out selectively the oxyfunctionalization of alkanes with O2. On the other hand, inorganic catalysts such as transition metal complexes and metal substituted polyoxometalates either in homogeneous phase or supported on a solid carrier by anchoring in mesoporous materials or by encapsulation in microporous molecular sieves are effective when using oxidants such as iodosylbenzene, alkyl hydroperoxides, and hydrogen peroxide,283,284,553-558 and can, in some cases, also use molecular oxygen as oxidant. 559-562
Aldehydes are oxidized to the corresponding peracids using O2. When this is done in the presence of a reactant able to be oxidized by the peracids, a system is developed in which the aldehyde can act as a oxygen transfer agent. This process can be carried out in homogeneous phase (Mukaiyama system), 563,564 and has also been carried out using aluminophosphates containing Mn (III) and Co (III) at 323 K and 30 bar and using benzaldehyde as the oxidant transfer agent to epoxidize cyclohexene, α-pinene, limonene, styrene, and 1-hexene, 565 as well as to carry out BaeyerVilliger oxidations. 566 The limitation of this procedure is that a sacrificial reactant, in this case benzaldehyde, is used that is transformed into benzoic acid. From this point of view, it is much better to use either H2O2 or H2O2 generated in situ. Thus, in an analogous way, H2O2 could also be generated in situ in the reaction media, and then it acts as the oxidant in the presence of the adequate catalyst. Thus, Solvay describes a process for the production of H2O2 using Pd on alumina catalyzed hydrogenation in an organic solvent in the presence of an alkylanthraquinone followed by oxidation in air. They also reported that organic peracids were efficiently prepared from the corresponding acid and H2O2 through the use of a support metal oxide that has been silanized. 567,568 Thus, Clerici and Ingallina 332,569 were able to epoxidize propylene in the presence of TS-1 and in one pot starting with an alkylated anthrahydroquinone with molecular oxygen and propylene (Scheme 45).
Scheme 45
In this process, the organic carrier does not interfere in the catalytic process since it cannot penetrate into the zeolite pores. In this process, it is claimed that the solvent and anthraquinone derivative play a crucial role. Yields of propylene, based on starting alkyl anthrahydroquinone, of 78% are obtained. Anthrahydroquinone is consumed in the first process, but regenerated separately by subsequent hydrogenation.
A similar reaction cycle is claimed by ARCO to occur with tetra-alkylammonium salts of the anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid in aqueous methanol, giving good yields of propylene epoxide.570
Following the methodology of generating H2O2 in situ, the most direct way to make this would be using O2 and H2. This is done by carrying out the propylene epoxidation on a bifunctional catalyst formed by Pd and Pt on TS-1. The noble metal catalyzes the formation of H2O2 from H2 and O2, while the TS-1 will react the formed H2O2 with propylene to give the epoxide. An optimized catalyst gives propylene oxide with selectivities up to 85% at conversions between 15 and 20%.75 Two drawbacks of this process is the need to operate under conditions close to the explosion limit, and the formation of propane coming from hydrogenation of propylene.
It is interesting to point out that when a catalyst formed by gold dispersed on TS-1 is used to epoxidize propylene with H2O2 formed in situ by reacting H2 and O2 at low temperature, no propane is formed and the selectivity to epoxide is high (99%), but conversion is low (<2%).571 There is no doubt that this system deserves further work trying to find the reasons for the low conversion obtained.
Transition metal substituted molecular sieves have also been used as selective catalysts for oxidizing saturated hydrocarbons using molecular oxygen. For instance, V-containing silicalite showed activity and selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. In this sense, Zatorski et al.572 have carried out selectively the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with O2 and N2O. The success of vanadium silicalite for the above reaction is attributed to the presence of vanadium (V) as the sole site of oxygen activation together with the absence of Brnsted acidity and a limited tendency for oxygen insertion or alkene activation at allylic positions due to the presence of stable VOSi bonds containing nonelectrophilic bridging oxygen ions, and a stable coordination of vanadium.573
Transition metals such as Cr3+, CoIII, MnIII, FeIII substituted in molecular sieve AlPO type structures could, in principle, in the presence of oxygen and saturated hydrocarbons favor the production of the free radicals involved in the oxyfunctionalization process. The existence of a radical mechanism for the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons using transition metals substituted AlPOs has been demonstrated by observing not only the reaction induction period and the diminishing of this when small amounts of a free radical initiator (TBHP) are added, but also by the reaction inhibitor effect of the well-known free radical scavenger hydroquinone.574,575 Indeed, chromium substituted aluminophosphate-5 (CrAPO-5) was active for the liquid-phase autoxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone with O2, in the presence of small amounts of alkyl hydroperoxide initiator. Tetralin, indone, and ethylbenzene have also been converted to the corresponding ketones.452,454,574
Unfortunately, the system is not fully heterogeneous due to some leaching of Cr3+ occurring during the reaction. Similarly, the use of acetic acid solvent during the aerobic oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid using CoAPO-5 results in leaching of cobalt, being the leached cobalt responsible for the catalytic activity.576 There is an interesting study on CoAPO-5 showing that in the presence of a strong apolar solvent, only an extremely low amount of Co is leached at conversion levels below 10% that cannot explain the autoxidation activity.523 When conversion level increases the acids formed in consecutive reactions enhances considerably Co leaching.
The interest of cyclohexane oxidation to produce cyclohexanone (for production of ε-caprolactam) and adipic acid (for producing polyamide fibers and polyurethane resins) strongly justify further efforts in looking for a selective heterogeneous catalyst for cyclohexane autoxidation. Recently, MnAPO-18 and MnAPO-36 have been reported to be stable catalysts for the autoxidation of cyclohexane when using the substrate as solvent.577,578 In this case, the influence of the level of conversion on leaching should also be carefully addressed.
A novel concept and very promising system to effect the oxidation of alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons consists of taking advantage of the electrostatic fields experienced inside the zeolite supercages, particularly those ion-exchanged with alkaline-earth cations, to stablize the collisional charge-transfer complexes between molecular oxygen and alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. 579-585 The hydrocarbon oxygen complexes undergoes a considerable stabilization (up to 8 kcal/mol). This stabilization can be experimentally demonstrated by measuring in the UVVis spectrum the λmax of the corresponding CT complexes and observing a gradual shift toward longer wavelengths as the Coulombic fields inside the zeolite cages increase. By selective excitation of these CT complexes with visible red light, the corresponding hydroperoxides are formed with almost complete selectivity. The course of the irradiation can be followed and the reaction intermediates characterized by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy of zeolite wafers in which the hydrocarbon and oxygen have been coadsorbed from the vapor phase. In this way, cyclohexane can be oxidized by oxygen to cyclohexane hydroperoxide with an almost complete selectivity at very high cyclohexane conversion. The proposed reaction mechanism is indicated in Scheme 46 and is thought to involve and initial electron transfer within the alkaneoxygen complex followed by hydrogen abstraction with the formation in a cage of a geminate carbon centered radical and a hydroperoxyl radical. This radical pair readily recombines to the alkylhydroperoxide. In this hydrocarbon selective oxidation, the zeolite plays a passive role merely defining a highly polar reaction cavity in which the CT complex becomes stabilized. Clearly, it would be worth exploring the promising opportunities of this remarkable stabilization of the contact charge transfer complex in continuous flow operation. Also, the development of the thermal version of this originally photochemical reaction will be of large interest due to the problem of reactor design using light as reagent and the economy of the process. 586
Scheme 46
Following with catalytic photochemical irradiation to oxidize alkanes, it has been established that the IR photolysis of alkanes on the surface of a solid can also promote their oxidation. Thus, laser stimulated isobutane selective oxidation to methacrylic acid over mixed lithium, lead phosphate has been reported. 587 For samples containing 5% Li3PO4, surface characterization indicates that the main crystal phase exposed to isobutane is Pb3(PO4)2 in which Li3PO4 is dispersed like in molecular state. Lewis basic sites are oxygens of the PO and POP groups, and Lewis acid sites are Pb2+ and Li+. The two terminal methyl groups are supposed to be chemisorbed on the terminal oxygen of neighboring Lewis basic sites. Laser photons at 1048 cm-1 in the IR region excited the PO bonds and after 1000 laser pulses the conversion of isobutane is about 8.2%. The product distribution is isobutene, methacrylic alcohol, and methacrylic acid, the selectivity to the latter exceeding 66%.587
Analogously, methanol undergoes IR laser-stimulated oxidative coupling to ethylene glycol on solid Li3PO4, FePO4, and Li3PO4 (5%)/FePO4. 588,589 Spectroscopic and desorption techniques support that there are two kinds of methanol adsorption on the surface of these phosphates. Adsorption through the interaction of CH on PO groups of the catalyst and dissociative adsorption of •CH2OH radicals on Lewis acid sites located on metal ions. Then, selective excitation of the solid surface PO bonds using a IR 1077 cm-1 laser pulse causes the vibrational activation of the surface lattice oxygen which on reaction with adsorbed CH3OH leads to hydrogen atom abstraction forming •CH2OH and enhancing of the oxidative coupling to ethylene glycol.588,589 The increase in the reaction temperature promotes product desorption, but also thermal reactions with formation of byproducts such as dimethyl ether, formaldehyde, and ethylene. Given the higher penetration power of IR radiation on solids, it would be of much interest to expand and explore the possibility to apply IR irradiation to promote alkane oxidation and other types of catalytic reactions.
A heterogeneous cobalt catalyst based on an immobilized trimeric cobalt complex on MCM-41 has been claimed for the conversion of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in an aerobic system using the substrate as solvent. The turnover numbers are modest (2 mol/site/h). Again leaching may be an issue when adipic acid will be formed at higher conversion levels.
An active epoxidation catalyst based on silica and MCM-supported metal complexes with the triazacyclononane ligand system has been prepared. 590 One of the N atoms is covalently linked to the silica wall through a glycidyl or chloropropyl linker. The other two N atoms were reacted with propylene oxide. Using the epoxidation of styrene as a test reaction, it was found the selectivities and turnover numbers are higher for MCM-derived materials than for silica.590
Liquid-phase partial oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds by air at atmospheric pressure has been conducted in the presence of chemically modified mesoporous silica containing chromium ions strongly coordinated to a carboxylate group covalently attached to the silica surface. 591 The preparation procedure is indicated in Scheme 47. This solid catalyst can effect the oxidation of neat ethylbenzene in air at reflux temperature with an isolated acetophenone yield of 50%. The catalyst was reused twice without any regeneration or conditioning treatment, by simply decanting the liquid from the reactor and adding fresh substrate. No leaching of the chromium was observed. The same catalyst also performs successfully for p-chlorotoluene and p-xylene.591 It was claimed that the activity of this mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst is significantly higher than the commercially supported chromium catalyst.
Scheme 47
In the case of n-alkane oxyfunctionalization, oxidation at low temperatures and at the terminal carbon is highly preferred. A recent work has showed that Co and MnAlPO-18 is a regioselective oxidation catalyst for n-alkanes. Because of the end-on approach of the n-paraffin in ALPO-18, owing to the pore dimensions and topology of this molecular sieve, only the C1 and C2 positions are preferentially oxidized. When other structures with larger pore dimensions (AlPO-36 and AlPO-5) are used, oxyfunctionalization is predominant at the C3 and C4 positions.301
b.Catalyst for Epoxidation of Propylene. The oxidation of olefins by molecular oxygen was applied commercially to ethylene, but oxygen epoxidation for larger olefins has been mostly unsuccessful using transition metal substituted molecular sieves as catalysts. The failure to directly epoxidize allylic olefins to their corresponding epoxides, and more specifically the case of propylene, can be related to the fact that the bond dissociation energy of the allylic CH bond in propylene is 77 kcal mol-1 much smaller than the corresponding dissociation energy of the vinylic CH bond in ethylene that is 112 kcal mol-1. 592 Then, abstraction of the allylic CH bond by O2 in propylene is considerably favored compared to the case of ethylene and consequently the selectivity to the epoxide is lower.
A large effort has been done for the development of soluble metal and metal complexes able to oxidize long chain olefins in liquid phase using O2 as a direct oxidant. In general it can be said that the most important limitations for the use of liquid-phase olefin epoxidation using solid catalysts are the low rates and low turnover frequencies, together with the too low selectivity to the desired epoxide owing to the presence of less desired free radical chain reactions. 593
Molten salt mixtures of LiNO3, NaNO3 have been used for epoxidation of propylene with O2 in vapor phase. However, it is not proven that molten salts apart from being the solvent act as catalysts. It is believed that the reaction is mainly thermal while some of the propylene oxide can also be produced from the co-oxidation of C3H6 by the peracids formed as subproducts in the thermal process.
We have discussed above about the indirect way of using O2 as an oxidant to generate in situ H2O2 and using Ti-containing molecular sieves, as catalysts. Besides these interesting results, it has been recently described a non-molecular sieve oxidation catalysts formed by gold supported on TiO2. 594,595 This catalyst is able to generate in situ H2O2 and then to oxidize propylene to epoxide when a reactant mixture of propylene, O2, and H2 is used. An important catalyst characteristic is that Au particles must have a hemispherically shape with sizes between 2.0 and 4.0 nm in diameter. The formation of small Au particles on the surface of TiO2 is achieved by depositionprecipitation of Au(OH)3, starting from a basic solution of chloriauric acid at pH = 710. After washing the sample, the catalyst is calcined at 400 C to form the gold particles.
The catalyst active sites are believed to be TiAu bridged sites that would form the activated molecular oxygen species. Reaction with H2 forms the hydroperoxo species that will be responsible for the epoxidation of propylene.332 This mechanism implies that the active sites for the reaction must exist at the interfacial edge of the hemispherical Au particles and the TiO2 support. This, indeed, would be consistent with the observation that the activity of an Au-supported TiO2 catalyst is higher than that of Au/TS-1 at the same Au weight loadings and crystallite size.571
Despite the high selectivities to propylene oxide obtained with the Au/TiO2 system, conversions are low, and turnover frequencies with this system for propylene epoxidation are on the order of 20200 times lower than for the epoxidation of ethylene with silver catalysts. An additional drawback of the Au/TiO2 catalyst is deactivation. Nevertheless, a considerable effort is currently being devoted to improve catalyst life and activity by means of modifying the Ti-containing support and catalyst preparation procedures. 596-599
Direct epoxidation of propylene with O2 has been carried out using silver catalysts. If the silver ethylene oxidation catalyst is used directly for the epoxidation of propylene very poor results are obtained. However, activity and selectivity improve when silver powder is slurred with group IIA metal halides, or when silver is combined with K+ and CaCO3. 600-603
Promising catalytic systems based on the above ideas have been described by Gaffney et al. 604-608 These systems use silver catalyst modified by K, Cl, Mo, Re, W as promoters and CaCO3, together with the introduction in the reactor of chlorine (in the form of ethyl chloride, up to 500 ppm) and up to 500 ppm of NO. With this catalytic system, 3.2% conversion levels with 59% selectivity to propylene oxide are achieved, the yield being not high enough for commercial application. The activity of the above catalyst has been explained by the authors assuming selective sites at the interface of Ag and CaCO3. If this is so, then the introduction of high levels of K and Cl that are responsible for increasing catalyst selectivity may be due to the selective poisoning of the less selective Ag sites at the surface of the silver surface in benefit of the desirable, more selective Ag sites at the interface of silver and CaCO3. If this hypothesis is true, increasing the surface contact between silver and CaCO3 should result in an increase of the active and selective sites and therefore in an increase in propylene yield.
Silver on alumina modified with Cs or Tl is a selective catalyst for the epoxidation of higher olefins that do not contain reactive allylic hydrogen atoms. 609-616 This catalyst was specially useful in the epoxidation of 1,4-butadiene (Scheme 48). The epoxidation of butadiene results in a selectivity to 1,2-epoxybutene of 95% with conversions close to 13%.
Scheme 48
The process uses a lower hydrocarbon as an inert co-feed that lowers the reaction temperature from 220 to 200 C. This process is commercially used today.
Besides butadiene, Monnier610 has reported the selective epoxidation of other higher nonallylic olefins as the ones summarized in Table 5 using Csl, CsCl, and RbCl promoted Ag/Al2O3 silver on alumina catalysts.

This catalytic system offers great potential and deserves further studies to determine which are the active sites and then to introduce rational catalyst modifications trying to increase their turnover number, activity, and selectivity.
c.Oxidation of Ethane and Ethylene. A catalytic process for the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid started commercially in 1997. 617-619 In this context, a metal catalyst with the composition TiPd0.01K0.03POx has been claimed to convert a mixture of ethylene and air at 205 C and 180 psi to acetic acid in 72.8% and ethylene glycol. Analogously, propylene was oxidized to acetone and propylene glycol using the same catalyst. 620,621
Ethane can also be directly oxidized to acetic acid using Re0.117VO0.254Nb0.067Sb0.03K0.05, Mo56Re6V26Nb7Sb3Ca2, a titania modified VPO catalyst, or a metal modified VPO catalysts. 622-625 A recent process gives high conversions and yields of acetic acid with a feed composed by 2% ethylene98% ethane in a fluidized bed of Mo0.37Re0.25V0.26Nb0.7Sb0.03Ca0.02Ox using a gas recycle to obtain at 500 C and 400 psi, high selectivities at ethane/ethylene conversion of 97% (Table 6).

It is interesting to point out that despite the extensive and excellent work carried out by BP on the production of acetic acid using solid catalysts, it was announced that they are commercially introducing an Ir carbonylation catalyst called CATIVA.
Catalytic oxidation of paraffins and olefins to products such as maleic anhydride, methacrylic acid, acrolein and acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile is a very active area of research and it has been discussed in part when commenting on the vanadium-containing catalysts.
IV. Application of Lewis Acid Catalyzed Oxidations in Various Fields
A. Examples of Catalytic Oxidations with Lewis Acids in Biochemistry
Lewis acid catalyzed oxidations have also a wide occurrence in biochemistry. Cellular oxidative stress has recently attracted considerable interest since it has been blamed, among other effects, as one of the main factors responsible for aging. The biomolecules involved in the oxidative stress, the transformations that they undergo, and the natural protecting mechanisms are the main aspects recently investigated related to catalytic oxidation. Also relevant to this review are those enzymatic systems that catalyze biochemical oxidations. Given the extension of these topics, only some pertinent contributions will be covered.
Transition metals in trace amounts have been found to be responsible for the oxidation of some biomolecules. Biomolecules can be damaged by oxidation and lose their function. A water-soluble salen Mn(III) or Ni(II) complex can act as efficient catalyst for the oxidative cleavage of DNA by magnesium monoperoxyphthalate at concentrations as low as 1 μM. 626 In contrast, other metal complexes do not induce any significant DNA damage at micromolar concentrations.626
It can be a metal ion interaction in the oxidative stress process. Thus, Zn2+ ions acts as inhibitors of the Cu2+ and Fe2+-initiated lipid oxidation, but do not prevent other oxidation processes that are promoted by other initiators such as azo compounds, UV irradiation, superoxide, or peroxinitrite. 627 The presence of Zn2+ does not change the physical properties of bilipidic membranes, but its mechanism of oxidation inhibition is related to its binding to the negative sites of the bilipidic membranes preventing Cu2+ and Fe2+ in occupying these negative positions on the membrane.627
The previous examples demonstrate that appropriate analytical techniques are necessary to quantify metal ions at low concentrations. In the context of assessing the presence of trace metal concentrations with, however, catalytic activity, it has been proposed that the lack of occurrence of ascorbate (vitamin C) autoxidation in aerated aqueous solutions at neutral pH is a test reaction to assess the total absence of transition metal ions in aqueous buffer solutions for biomedical applications. Vitamin C is an important water-soluble natural antioxidant. It was found that in metal-free, air-saturated aqueous solutions, the first-order rate constant of ascorbate disappearance at pH 7 has to be lower than 6 × 10-7 s-1. 628 Acceleration of ascorbate oxidation indicates the presence of transition metals even in trace amounts. 629
In a parallel way to ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol (vitamin E) is the most important lipid soluble antioxidant in human plasma. However, α-tocopherol has been found to promote oxidation of lipoproteins as it was demonstrated by the transformation of cholesteryl esters into their hydroperoxides. 630 In vitro and in vivo α-tocopherol-depleted lipoproteins and plasma lipids were highly resistant to hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals peroxidation at mild radical flux. Wherever tested (in vivo or in vitro), the oxidability of low-density lipoproteins increases with α-tocopherol content. However, under high fluxes of ROO• and •OH, the influence α-tocopherol changes from pro- to antioxidant, with the switching point for •OH being lower than for ROO•.630
Highly reactive radicals (such as •OH) promote oxidative stress in biomolecules under aerobic conditions. The oxidative stress is initiated by hydrogen abstraction or even electron transfer from an electron-rich moiety of the biomolecule to the aggressive radical. Hydroxyl radicals can be formed in solutions containing oxygen or hydrogen peroxide when trace transition metals are present. From there, it derives the importance to determine the presence of peroxides in biochemical fluids. A procedure developed for the detection of hydrogen peroxide in biological fluids involves contacting the solution with a redox indicator and an iron metal complex of creatinine or guanidine. 631
Amino acids of peptides and proteins can undergo irreversible modification, activity loss, and increased susceptibility to proteolysis and fragmentation initiated by hydroxyl radicals generated from hydrogen peroxide in the presence of metals. For instance, it has been reported that histidine amino acid undergoes very easily a chemical degradation by hydroxyl radicals. 632
Related with the understanding of amyloid β deposits that appear in Alzheimer and mad cow diseases, it was reported that these amyloids were able to generate free radicals detectable by conventional ESR spectroscopy. It was even proposed that these radicals produce the neurotoxicity manifested in these diseases. Subsequent studies, however, have shown that these radicals are indeed formed by traces of transition metals present as impurities in the commercial di-N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone reagent used as the ESR detectable radical source. 633
There is one type of liquid chromatography to separate biomolecules based on metal affinity. In this chromatography, the stationary phase contains an immobilized transition metal complex that interacts with the biomolecule. Using lactate dehydrogenase as a probe enzyme, it was demonstrated that liquid chromatography based on a metal affinity column using immobilized Cu2+-iminodiacetic acid may produce the partial or total inactivation of a enzyme when oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or reducing agents such as ascorbate are present in the eluate. In the absence of redox reagents, no decrease in the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase was observed. The results show that one has to be aware of the possibility that this type of liquid chromatography alters a biomolecule during the purification process. 634
Magnesium can act as Lewis acid and through binding with a carbonyl group can control the stereochemistry of the oxidation of NADH analogues by p-benzoquinones. 635 The axis of the carbonyl group bound to the dihydropyridine heterocycle forms a dihedral angle of 55. Without Mg2+ ion, the anti hydrogen with respect to the carbonyl group is 3 to 30 times much more reactive than the corresponding syn hydrogen. In contrast, when Mg2+ binds to the carbonyl group the selectivity is shifted toward syn preference.635 This is a good example of Lewis acid assisted oxidation in which the product stereoselectivity is controlled by the Lewis acid interaction with a remote group.
Frequently, enzymes have an active center surrounded by a proteinic backbone that modulates the activity of the center and defines the reaction cavity in which the transformation is going to occur. In many aspects, this situation is similar to that occurring in some porous solid catalysts, in which the active site is embedded in the interior of a rigid matrix. In some way, enzymes have inspired some advances in heterogeneous catalysis. 636-639
Manganese is an essential bioelement that is present in the active site of a large number of enzymes, such as citochromes. In this case, the enzyme contains a manganese complex with a porphyrin ligand. It is widely accepted that manganese plays two functional roles. 640 Mn2+ acts as Lewis acid like other divalent ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ like in arginase, glutamine synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate synthase, and pyruvate carboxylase. On the other hand, at higher oxidation states (Mn3+ or MnIV), manganese acts as oxidation site, like copper, iron, or cobalt. The most well-known enzymes of this type are manganese superoxide dismutase, manganese peroxidase, and manganese catalase. The last enzyme is responsible for one of the most important reactions occurring in green plants, namely, the light driven oxidation of water to oxygen and protons.640
A study on the role of non-heme iron cluster present on the flavoprotein 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA deshydratase has shown that this enzyme contains a flavin FAD unit that undergoes reversible reduction/reoxidation during the catalytic cycle, but there was not equilibration with the non-heme [4Fe-4S] cluster, iron being difficult to reduce as assessed by EPR spectroscopy. 641 Apparently, the iron cluster serves as a Lewis acid site facilitating the oxidation process by interaction with the substrate.641
B. Contribution of Permanganate to Green Chemistry
Permanganate has been the most popular oxidant whose reactions are studied in general organic chemistry textbooks,151 and its chemistry has a long and extensive story. Permanganate is frequently proposed as the prototypical stoichiometric oxidant giving metal ion or oxide products for which green chemistry is searching replacement using catalytic oxidations. The main problem of the use of permanganate arises from the need of stoichiometric amounts and the production of large amounts of metal byproducts, rather than from its toxicity. Indeed, recycling of manganese dioxide, by reducing the product in basic media can help to circumvent the problem of wastes making the use of permanganate more environmentally attractive for industrial applications. 642 In this way, there is a process in which after the use of KMnO4, the reduced Mn2+ and other manganese species are separated by adsorption on diatomite, decalite, or fuller's earth. 643 Subsequent treatment of the material retained in the filter with 1.52.5 M nitric acid solution solubilizes the K2O and transforms the Mn species into γ-MnO2 which is adequate to be used in dry cell batteries643 or can be recycled. Alternatively, dissolved manganese from industrial water can be recovered using oxidizing agent such as ClO2 or NaClO or even KMnO4 to convert Mn ions into MnO2 followed by microfiltration or ultrafiltration of the treated water. 644
One aspect of green chemistry is pollution abatement. Permanganate can contribute to the development of green chemistry by helping to degrade pollutants. 645 In this context, potassium permanganate has been widely used in drinkable water treatment plants, although its use seems to decline. According to the American Water Works Association 646 up to 40% of the water plants used KMnO4 for predisinfection/oxidation and organic removal, since it is effective to deal in potable waters with problems of iron, manganese, hydrogen sulfide, reservoir algae, and zebra mussels, while at the same time it improves the organoleptic properties of water in terms of color, odor, and taste.646 In addition, KMnO4 also produces the inactivation of bacteriophage and Legionella pneumophila. In a totally different aspect of water treatment, chemical oxygen demand is an important parameter to assess the organic content of a wastewater. Standard methods to determine such values are based on the KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 oxidizability of wastewaters. 647
Permanganate is a strong oxidant that has been used for the degradation of industrial pollutants and metal ions in effluents. 648-650 Thus, it is particularly suitable to oxidize phenols that are organic pollutants refractory to biological water remediation with bacteriae. Phenols are found in high concentration in industrial wastewaters from the petrochemical industry and paint stripping. Also, permanganate has been reported as a chemical oxidant for laboratory scale degradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene organic compounds present in contaminated soils and groundwater.645 Dimethyl and diethyl sulfides in industrial wastewaters can be removed for deodorization by extraction with toluene and oxidation of the extracted sulfides with an aqueous solution of KMnO4. 651 The organic solvent is separated from the aqueous solution in which oxidation has occurred and recycled.651
On a larger scale, potassium permanganate solutions have been injected into low-permeability, contaminated soils for in situ chemical oxidation of trichloroethene at a former industrial site. 652 After the treatment, the concentration of trichloroethene was below detection limit. However, the procedure suffers from an inhomogeneous distribution of KMnO4 in the soil to achieve overall treatment performance.652
One of the industrial processes in which large quantities of oxidants are consumed is in the pulp and paper industry to remove lignin. Permanganate has been considered as a bleaching reagent for chlorine-free bleaching of kraft pulps. 653 Permanganate oxidizes lignin and is converted to MnO2, which remains in the treated pulp fibers because of its insolubility in water.653 Addition of oxalic acid as a reducing agent transforms MnO2 into manganese ion after the pulp bleaching.653 Using lignin models such as veratraldehyde, it was found that the pH of the bleaching liquor has to be kept over 2 to effectively degrade nonphenolic lignin.
A procedure to evaluate the quality of bitumens, petroleum resids, and asphaltics is based on the consumption of permanganate that is proportionally related to the content of structural elements. 654
The wide interest of permanganate has promoted a series of studies to find effective ways of insolubilizing the oxidant allowing separation and reuse. In this way, it has been found that the activity and selectivity of permanganate can be modulated by adsorption on various solid supports. 655 In contrast to the products obtained when an inert support such as bentonite is used, permanganate adsorbed on moist alumina cleaves CC bonds with the formation of aldehydes in good yields (7095%) under mild conditions (Scheme 49). Apparently, the Lewis acidity of alumina participates in the proton-transfer steps that accompanies the oxidation reactions. Systematic studies on the specific reactivity of supported permanganate have, however, not been undertaken. Supported permanganate may be an interesting oxidant, provided that a recycling/reoxidation procedure is devised making possible its reuse.
Scheme 49
Highly toxic, volatile dimethylselenide can be completely transformed into nonpurgable dimethylselenoxide by reaction with δ-MnO2 which is converted into Mn2+ ions. 656 Permanganate and chromate were found less efficient for this process. It is proposed that dimethylselenide acts as Lewis base and donates a lone electron pair to unoccupied orbitals of surface manganese atoms of MnO2 that would act as Lewis acid site.656
Oxidative degradation of pyridine on the surface of hydrated manganese dioxide occurs through a two-step process. Fast adsorption of pyridine on the solid Lewis acid sites is followed by slower oxidation. 657 Autoclaving at about 150 C for 2 days of a layered structure of Mn oxide obtained by reaction of MnO4- and Mn2+ in strong basic medium gives a thermally stable (500 C) molecular sieve corresponding to natural todorokite, having 6.9 Å of pore diameter. 658 The solid exhibits Lewis and Brnsted acidity and has been proposed to have application as oxidation catalyst and as a sensor.658 However, the porous structure of the Mn oxide collapses at 600 C. Other porous manganese oxides having activity to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes or ketones have been recently reported. 659
Selective oxidation of NH3 by NOx operating at temperatures below 200 C in the presence of water at NOx conversions higher than 80% at space velocities of 3000050000 h-1 have been reported with a MnO2 catalyst prepared by egg-shell precipitation around NaY zeolite particles. 660
C. Catalytic Oxidations for Degradation of Pollutants
As we have been commenting on in the previous section, one important field in environmental science and technology is that devoted to pollution abatement and remediation of waste efluents. This field certainly will attrack more interest in the forthcoming years. A general methodology to treat wastes containing organic compounds is to perform a chemical oxidation of these effluents at the deepest possible degree of oxidation. Many of these processes are catalyzed by transition metals.
Although these catalytic oxidations are generally devised to degrade chemicals, transition metals may play a negative, unforeseen role in atmospheric pollution. In relation to acid rain and cloud acidity, it has been found that SO2 oxidation by oxygen is catalyzed by aqueous Co, Cu, Mn, and Fe ions, this oxidation enhancing the damage of the acid rain. 661 The presence of simple carboxylic acid such as acetic, formic and oxalic acids inhibits this oxidation, an effect that was explained as reflecting the formation of Fe(III)-oxalate complex that leads to a depletion of catalytically active free Fe(III) cation. 662
In this context, a hypothesis has been proposed in which the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels produces humic-like compounds that will form part of air particulates, conferring them the capacity to complex first-row transition metals. These complexes present in the air would participate in the production of free organic radicals by cycling these transition metals through two valence states. 663 Therefore, the concentration of transition metals and oxidizing power of air pollution particulates would increase with the content of humic-like substances associated to the pollution. This theory was supported by using filters to collect air-borne particulate and subsequently extracting the humic-like substances with alkali. There was a correlation between the concentration of metal in the particulate and the amount of humic-like present in the particulate. These analyses may explain the way in which substances derived from incomplete fuel combustion enhance the free radical ability of air particulate.663
On a more positive side of catalytic oxidations, aqueous solutions of transition metals have been used as catalysts in the remediation of polluted waters by promoting the oxidative degradation of the organic contaminants. Generally, the process requires the addition of a strong oxidizing reagent to produce a substantial degree of decomposition. Examples are the degradative oxidation of 4-aminopyridine by ozone in the presence of catalytic amounts of sulfates of V, Fe, or Cu 664 and the degradation of 1,4-dioxan as a model organic compound in water by ozone using first-row transition metal oxides as catalysts. 665 Cyanide is also oxidized to environmentally acceptable compounds by H2O2 with a heterogeneous catalyst containing Ag, Cu, or Ni on alumina, silica, or in a zeolite. 666
A procedure in which phenol, chlorinated phenols, and hydroquinolines are removed from wastewaters using high oxygen pressure and a large excess of alkali metal carbonates (typically over 20 mol of carbonate × mol of phenol) in the presence of a transition metal phthalocyanine, porphyrin, or salicylidene complex as catalyst has been reported. 667 In the absence of oxygen, a related treatment of phenol with transition metal-catalyzed has been reported to effect the formation of polyphenylene ethers. 668
Polluting polyamine chelating agents can be removed from aqueous solutions by oxygen oxidation in the presence of equivalents amounts of transition metal ions followed by biological treatment with denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The process can be completed by optional membrane filtration. 669
Transition metals are also able to act as catalysts for the complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds. 670 LaMnO3+ perovskite has shown activity for the total catalytic degradation of chlorinated C2 hydrocarbons to COx, mainly CO2, and HCl. 671 The presence of water has a positive effect on the degree of degradation, decreasing the amount of chlorinated byproducts and enhancing carbon dioxide formation.671 Oxygen must also be present in the system to maintain the activity of the perovskite which should contain overstoichiometric amounts of oxygen.671 Likewise oxidation of CH2Cl2 with oxygen gas has been studied over δ-alumina and Al2O3SiO2 in a wide range of different compositions. 672,673 Pure SiO2 shows no activity.
Heavily polluted aqueous effluents cannot be treated realistically with oxidants other than oxygen. For these cases, the most common remediation procedure is wet air oxidation, in which wastewater and oxygen or air are heated at high temperatures (150400 C) and pressures (20 MPa). Catalytic wet air oxidation can be an interesting alternative to classical wet air oxidation. The presence of a catalyst should make it possible to conduct more efficiently the degradation under not so extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Low molecular weight carboxylic acids, which are the intermediary products formed in the course of some advanced oxidation techniques, are good model compounds to test the efficiency improvement of catalytic wet air oxidation. These simple carboxylic acids are among the most recalcitrant organic compounds to undergo further oxidative mineralization. Using transition metal ion-exchanged Y zeolites as catalysts and hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing reagent, it has been possible to effect the oxidation of acetic acid in aqueous solutions below the water boiling point. 674,675 A particularly effective catalyst for this catalytic, a wet air oxidation process was Cu2+-exchanged Y zeolite in where the Cu2+ was complexed with oxalic acid.674,675 On the other hand, wastewaters containing both organic material and heavy metal ions, such as those from the photographic industry, can be treated with a combination of chemical oxidation and electrolysis. 676
Some alkyl- or aryl-phosphonates are used as insecticides, and they may be present in surface waters in certain areas and periods. The decomposition can be carried out using air as oxidant at temperatures between 200 and 400 C. Dimethyl methylphosphonate can be oxidatively decomposed using amorphous manganese oxide or alumina-supported manganese oxide as catalysts. 677 FTIR analysis suggests that dimethyl methylphosphonate strongly binds to the Mn Lewis acid sites on the manganese oxide surface through phosphoryl oxygens.677
Studies on the mechanisms of the oxidative degradation of organic compounds are scarce due to the complexity of the problem and the need to apply fast spectroscopic techniques. A pulse radiolysis study on the one electron oxidation of 1,2-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone and its Cu(II), Ni(II), and Fe(III) complexes by hydroxyl radicals has provided evidence that in this case there are two reaction pathways involving the intermediacy of semiquinone radical cation or the OH-adduct, respectively. 678 The former path undergoes disproportionation, while the transition metal coordinated OH adduct leads to trihydroxyanthraquinone.
Photocatalytic oxidative degradation uses a semiconductor oxide such as TiO2 or ZnO in combination or not with an organic dye that upon light absorption in aqueous medium generates hydroxyl radicals (OH•) and other reactive oxygen species (superoxide, singlet oxygen, etc.) that attack the organic material present in water and initiates its oxidative degradation. 679,680 Despite the general applicability of photocatalytic techniques, the two major limitations are the high energy costs associated to the irradiation, the need for more efficient photocatalysts and the requirement of transparency of the effluents.
The mechanism of acetonitrile photooxidation on TiO2 has been investigated using IR spectroscopic. 681 At temperatures higher than 73 C, the adsorption of CH3CN on both isolated TiOH groups and Ti4+ Lewis acid sites was observed. Under UV irradiation (hν 350 nm), CH3CN is oxidized in the presence of O2 to form CO2, H2O, surface carbonate, and an intermediate isocyanate species. Photooxidation of the CH3 moiety of acetonitrile occurs more easily than that of the CN.681
The effect of doping with transition metals on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 has been studied mechanistically by means of femtosecond pumpprobe diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and also from preparative studies. 682 It was found that the second-order recombination rate constant of photogenerated electron and holes markedly increases with loading of the transition metal, even at low doping level (0.3%), and this correlates with the decrease in the rate of formation of the main products (H2, CO2, etc.) of the photocatalytic degradation.682
The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 toward the decomposition of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in aqueous solution can be largely improved by loading with WO3. 683 It was found that WO3 covers the surface of TiO2 with a monolayer. The resulting WO3/TiO2 disperse better in the aqueous solution than the pure TiO2. For the gas-phase photooxidation of benzene and 2-propanol WO3/TiO2 shows 3.65.9 times the photocatalytic activity of pure TiO2.683
In situ FT-IR studies during the gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol over TiO2 have revealed that the photoactivity correlates with the surface acidity and the concentrations of Ti3+ and carbonate surface concentration.59
Further improvements are still needed in the field of photocatalysis in terms of more efficient lamps, better match between lamp emission and photocatalyst absorption and higher quantum yields of OH• generation.
Aerated aqueous solutions of Fe2(SO4)3 have been reported to effect desulfuration of mineral raw materials, particularly coal, by oxidizing the sulfur to sulfate. A catalytic process to eliminate low-valent sulfur compounds present in water by adding hydrogen peroxide and a transition metal supported on alumina or silica has been patented. 684 Polysulfide can also be obtained by oxidation using oxygen containing gases in the presence of transition metals. 685,686
A method and an apparatus to perform the biogas purification based on the aqueous oxidation of H2S to S at acidic pH has been devised. 687 The system uses Fe3+ chelates of nitrilotriacetic and ethylendiaminotetracetic assisted by minor amounts of Cu or Ni salts and operates by reoxidizing the Fe after biogas treatment and recycling of the Fe-containing solution. Analogously, H2S and SO2 can be removed from a gas stream by oxidation using a transition metal complex solution in water an a flotation cell. 688,689
Homo- and copolymers derived of acrylamide can gelate aqueous solutions. It has been reported an interesting system in which one of such poly acrylamide hydrogels containing Fe, Ni, or Co salts is able to act as catalyst for the oxidation of Na2S with O2 in aqueous solutions at 40 C. 690
In aqueous solution, the activity of a series of transition metal oxides supported on carbon has been determined for the catalytic oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur. 691 It was found these carbon-supported transition metal oxides have comparable activities to that of Co-phthalocyanines.691
The acid rain is caused by the burning of fuels with high S content. To avoid this serious environmental problem, legislations have been implemented to limit the maximum S content in fuels. A strategy to decrease the sulfur content in fuels is to oxidize the sulfur compounds transforming them in less volatile sulfoxides or sulfones that can be more easily separated from the fuel.
A procedure for sweetening the hydrocarbon feedstock by removing sulfur has been patented in which the catalyst is prepared by impregnation on active carbon or other solid support of an alcoholic solution of the catalyst that is a chelate of bis-salicylamide. 692 In a related process for purifying liquid organosulfur-containing hydrocarbons, an aqueous sulfuric acid solution containing transition metal is submitted to electrolysis to oxidize the metal ions to their highest oxidation state and, subsequently, the electrolyzed aqueous solution emulsified with the feedstock. This treatment removes organosulfur compounds from the hydrocarbon by converting them into a gas, or water soluble or resinous products. 693 The acid aqueous solution is separated and recycled via electrolysis.693
Molybdenum oxide supported on alumina (MoO3/Al2O3 12.5 wt %) has been nitrided by temperature programmed reaction with ammonia at various temperatures and their activity toward hydrodesulfuration of dibenzothiophene studied. 694 It was concluded that metallic Mo0 and Mo2+ are the most active species for the hydrodesulfuration.694
After international treaties to destroy chemical warfare stockpiles, there has been an interest in determining a suitable procedure to degrade mustard gas, one of the most widespread warfare chemicals. 695 Bleach is a suitable decontamination procedure for treating contaminated people or material, 696 but the proposed procedure for large scale destruction of contaminated material is incineration. This poses problems from the point of view of the environment. It has been reported that mustard gas can be transformed into the nontoxic corresponding sulfide and sulfone in aqueous media by hydrogen peroxide using metal meso-tetraarylporphyrin and imidazole or ammonium acetate as cocatalyst (Scheme 50). 697 The activity of metalloporphyrin depends markedly on the nature of the metal (Fe3+ more efficient than Mn3+). With the Fe metal complex, the oxygen transfer is fairly good (up to 95%) and the substrate/catalyst concentration ratio can be high (420).697
Scheme 50
The kinetics of the aerobic oxidation of SO2 in water at different pHs in the presence of transition metal ions has been studied. 698 Highly active clay composite for the removal of SOx from flue gas streams was obtained by precipitating CaCO3 or Ca(OH)2 onto the clay from an aqueous clay slurry and incorporating a transition metal oxide as finely divided metal oxide powder, metal salt or as clay-intercalated metal cation. 699 The clay acts as a dispersing agent for the base and the transition metal decreasing particle agglomeration and increasing the SOx uptake.
D. Domestic and Technical Applications of Catalytic Oxidations
Besides the production of chemicals, Lewis acid catalyzed oxidations have also other curious applications that have impact in our daily life. In this section, we will provide some examples to give a flavor of the vast potential of catalytic oxidations.
A domestic application that takes advantage of the ability of catalytic oxidations by transition metal ions to effect the degradation of organic compounds is self-cleaning coatings for ovens. Besides water binders, hardening agents, and surfactants, the coating contains transition metal oxides deposited on activated alumina. 700,701
The ability of transition metal ions in intermediate oxidation states to react with oxygen has been used in the formulation of adsorbent compositions to remove simultaneously oxygen and water from gas mixtures. A solution of a salt of Cr, Mn, V, or Mo in their higher oxidation states is adsorbed onto SiO2 gel, alumina, or pumice stone and then reduced with H2, CO, or coal gas. 702 On the other hand, a kit to determine quantitatively the oxygen content for aquarium application has been devised based on the presence of an oxidizable transition metal and a redox indicator capable of a color change upon oxidation of the metal salt. The resulting color is visually compared with a graduated scale. 703
The combination of a bivalent transition metal or a transition metal complex of Mn. Co, Cu, Fe, and Ru with a peroxy compound or sodium perborate has been patented as a bleach-enchancer agent for cloth or dish washing, cleaning and disinfection. 704-706 After treating aqueous solutions of alkyl polyglycoside surfactants with a peroxide-decomposing transition metal, addition of hydrogen peroxide can be used to bleach the color of these solutions. 707
Catalytic oxidation at temperatures below 100 C and atmospheric pressure is the key step in a procedure for the treatment of malodorous gas. First, the gases are contacted with a scrubbing water to adsorb the malodorous components. The aqueous medium contains an alkali, alkaline-earth, or transition metal ion as catalyst and optionally a solid oxide as support. 708
Another use of transition metal-catalyzed oxidation is in shrink proofing fibers to effect the decomposition of the keratin layer on natural fibers using H2O2 as oxidizing reagent. 709
Transition metal ions can also catalyze the explosive decomposition of inorganic oxidizer salt. Thus, the major component of a detonator has been manufactured by adding significant amounts (0.210%) of transition metals (Cr, Co, Cu, and Mn) as a mixed alkali metal phosphate or as a complex to hot aqueous solutions of NH4NO3 and filtrating the precipate upon cooling the solution to ambient temperature. 710
Triazole and tetrazole in combination with an oxidizer, a transition metal oxide, and chlorates or perchlorates are the chemical components of the gas generating charges for airbag inflation. 711 Triazole or tetrazole have replaced more toxic and unstable azide-based compounds as propellant in airbag inflation devices. A transition metal oxide such as CuO is required to catalyze the explosive autoignition decomposition of the nitrogenated pentacyclic heterocycle at around 170 oC. 712,713
V. Conclusions
In this review, we have shown the evolution from homogeneous Lewis acids as catalysts to solid oxidation catalysts. The simplest strategy in which the Lewis acid is deposited on a solid surface has evolved to more elaborate ones in which the Lewis site forms part of the solid framework. Titanium silicalite is the most emblematic example of this type of solid oxidation catalysts.
Soon, it can be foreseen that the lead initiated by TS-1 will continue. New solids in which framework transition metals exhibit Lewis acidity will be synthesized and tested as oxidation catalysts. The acid strength and oxidation activity of the Lewis site will be modulated and adjusted to the reaction requirements by careful control of the chemical composition of the coordination sphere. The substrate and reagent concentration around the site will be controlled by modifying the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the solid.
The centers will be designed inspired not only on homogeneous Lewis acids, but also learning from the active centers of enzymes and biomolecules. Bioinspiration and molecular modeling will emerge as powerful strategies in catalyst design. These tools will be accompanied by new synthetic procedures in which the solids will be manipulated at the atomic level to assemble clusters that could act as active centers. For multifunctional catalysts, the sites will be located at the required distance and with the necessary strength. The combination of all these new approaches will necessarily result in more efficient, active, and environmentally friendly solid catalysts, particularly for the selective oxidation of alkanes or using oxygen as an oxidant.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
