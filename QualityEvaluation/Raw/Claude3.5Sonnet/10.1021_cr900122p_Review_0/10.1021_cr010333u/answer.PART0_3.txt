[1] "The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis."

[2] "It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

[3] "In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer."

[4] "Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through the Mars van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism involves cooperation between acid-base and redox sites on the catalyst surface. The process occurs in several steps:

1. Activation of the substrate on a metal cation acting as a Lewis acid site
2. Insertion of oxygen from the lattice 
3. A redox process at the metal site involving electron transfer

The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer during this process. Surface O= or OH- species act as basic sites.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which is believed to occur through the Mars van Krevelen mechanism. Other examples include the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide.

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism allows for selective oxidation by controlling the reaction through the catalyst's surface properties and structure. This enables the transformation of alkanes into more valuable oxidized products under controlled conditions.

在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过Mars van Krevelen机制促进C-H键活化。这种机制涉及催化剂表面酸碱位点和氧化还原位点之间的协同作用。该过程包括几个步骤：

1. 在作为Lewis酸位点的金属阳离子上活化底物
2. 从晶格中插入氧
3. 在金属位点发生涉及电子转移的氧化还原过程

在这个过程中，底物经历氢抽提、氧插入和电子转移。表面O=或OH-物种充当碱性位点。

这些原理被应用于烷烃的工业选择性氧化。一个具体的例子是丁烷转化为马来酸酐，据信是通过Mars van Krevelen机制进行的。其他例子包括在羟基磷酸盐上进行异丁酸氧化脱氢生成甲基丙烯酸，以及在氧化镁负载的钒氧化物上进行丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。

Mars van Krevelen机制通过控制催化剂的表面性质和结构来实现选择性氧化。这使得在受控条件下可以将烷烃转化为更有价值的氧化产品。
