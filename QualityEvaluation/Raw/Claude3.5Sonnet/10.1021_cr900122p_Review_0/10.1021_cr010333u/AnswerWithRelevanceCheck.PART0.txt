          "It consists of a series of elementary steps that include: (i) activation of the substrate on a metallic cation; (ii) insertion of oxygen from lattice oxygens; and (iii) a redox process at the metallic site and the transfer of one or several electrons."

"In the first step, metallic cations act as Lewis acid sites, and the basic sites are surface O= or OH- species. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer."

"Some examples of processes that are believed to occur through this mechanism include the oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, isobutyric acid oxidative dehydrogenation to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates, and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide."

"For the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride by vanadyl pyrophosphate, the process is supposed to occur specifically on the (1.0.0) face of crystal. This assumption is supported by the spatial distribution of the atoms in the catalyst exposed to the CC and CH bonds of n-butane."

"Three are the general ways in which a Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions:
(i) A Lewis acid can abstract a single electron from an electron-rich molecule.
(ii) The oxidation catalytic center is an assembly of a Lewis acid site, a Lewis basic site, and a metal atom that undergoes variation in its oxidation state through the catalytic cycle.
(iii) A Lewis acid can catalyze oxidation reactions by forming acidbase adducts either with the substrate or with the oxidizing agent, enhancing their reactivity and thereby acting as catalyst for the oxidation."

"The Mars and van Krevelen mechanism is one of the most general mechanisms for oxidation reaction in metallic oxides, being the cooperation of acidbase and redox sites the key point for catalysis."

          Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms, primarily the Mars van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism involves cooperation between acid-base and redox sites on the catalyst surface and consists of the following key steps:

1. Activation of the substrate on a metal cation acting as a Lewis acid site
2. Insertion of oxygen from the lattice 
3. A redox process at the metal site involving electron transfer

The metal centers can facilitate oxidation reactions in three general ways:
1. Single electron abstraction from an electron-rich molecule
2. Acting as part of a catalytic center that includes Lewis acid, Lewis base, and redox-active metal sites
3. Forming acid-base adducts with the substrate or oxidizing agent to enhance reactivity

In the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface O= or OH- species act as basic sites, while metallic cations serve as Lewis acid sites. The substrate undergoes hydrogen abstraction, oxygen insertion, and electron transfer during this process.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. A specific example is the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, which occurs on vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts. This reaction is believed to take place specifically on the (1,0,0) crystal face, where the spatial arrangement of atoms facilitates interaction with the C-C and C-H bonds of butane.

Other industrial applications using similar principles include:
- Oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid on hydroxy phosphates
- Propane dehydrogenation to propene on magnesia-supported vanadium oxide

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism allows for selective oxidation by controlling the reaction through the catalyst's surface properties and structure. This enables the transformation of alkanes into more valuable oxidized products under controlled conditions.

          在异相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进C-H键活化，主要是Mars van Krevelen机制。这种机制涉及催化剂表面酸碱位点和氧化还原位点之间的协同作用，包括以下关键步骤：

1. 在作为Lewis酸位点的金属阳离子上活化底物
2. 从晶格中插入氧
3. 在金属位点发生涉及电子转移的氧化还原过程

金属中心可以通过三种一般方式促进氧化反应：
1. 从富电子分子中抽取单个电子
2. 作为包括Lewis酸、Lewis碱和氧化还原活性金属位点的催化中心的一部分
3. 与底物或氧化剂形成酸碱加合物，增强反应活性

在Mars van Krevelen机制中，表面O=或OH-物种充当碱性位点，而金属阳离子作为Lewis酸位点。在这个过程中，底物经历氢抽提、氧插入和电子转移。

这些原理被应用于烷烃的工业选择性氧化。一个具体的例子是丁烷转化为马来酸酐，这发生在钒酰焦磷酸盐催化剂上。这个反应被认为特别发生在(1,0,0)晶面上，其中原子的空间排列有利于与丁烷的C-C和C-H键相互作用。

使用类似原理的其他工业应用包括：
- 在羟基磷酸盐上进行异丁酸氧化脱氢生成甲基丙烯酸
- 在氧化镁负载的钒氧化物上进行丙烷脱氢生成丙烯

Mars van Krevelen机制通过控制催化剂的表面性质和结构来实现选择性氧化。这使得在受控条件下可以将烷烃转化为更有价值的氧化产品。
