Synthetic methods chemistry has undergone intense 
development during the past 50 years. As a result, 
nearly every class of organic compound can now be 
considered as a source of starting materials for selec- 
tive conversion to members of other classes, as well 
as to a wide range of more complicated materials, such 
as polymers, biomolecules, and metal-organic com- 
pounds. 
An important class of molecules that represents an 
exception to this generalization is alkanes, or satu- 
rated hydrocarbons. Among the thousands of reagents 
in the modern arsenal of synthetic organic methodol- 
ogy, few have been developed that are capable of 
carrying out selective chemistry on alkanes. The lack 
of reactivity of alkane C-H bonds is often attributed 
to their high bond energies (typically 90-100 kcaLo1) 
and very low acidity (difficult to measure directly but 
estimated to have pKa = 45-60) and basicity. 
The robust nature of alkanes presents both a 
fundamental and a practical challenge to chemists. At 
the fundamental level, carbon-hydrogen and carbon- 
carbon bonds are the most ubiquitous chemical link- 
ages in nature. Elucidating the requirements neces- 
sary to effect their cleavage or their transformation 
Bruce A. Arndtsen was born in Minneapolis, MN, 1966. He received his B.A. 
degree in chemistry from Carleton College in 1988. In 1993, he obtained his Ph.D. 
degree from Stanford University under the direction of Prof. Lisa McElwee-White 
examining the generation of zero-vaient tungsten nitrene complexes. He is currently 
a postdoctoral associate with Robert Bergman at the University 
of California, Berkeley. 
Robert G. 
Bergman was born in 1942 in Chicago. IL. He graduated from Carleton 
College in 1963 and received his Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Wisconsin 
in 1966 under the direction of Jerome A. Berson. After a postdoctoral stay with 
Ronald Breslow at Columbia, he accepted his first academic position at the California 
Institute of Technology in 1967, where he worked in the area of organic reaction 
mechanisms. In 1978 he moved to Berkeley to accept a joint appointment as 
professor of chemistry at the University of California and principal investigator at the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His research at Berkeley has focused on C-H 
activation reactions and the chemistry of nitrosyl complexes, heterobinuclear 
complexes, and complexes with metal-heteroatom bonds.

Thomas H. Peterson was born in 1964 in Portland, OR. He did not receive his 
undergraduate degree at Carleton College. He obtained a B.A. degree in chemistry 
from Southern Oregon State College in 1987 and a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from

into other bonds lies at the heart of our understanding 
of chemical reactivity. On the more practical side, 
alkanes (especially methane) are abundant and rela- 
tively inexpensive. Methane is the primary constitu- 
ent of natural gas, and alkanes typically make up 
about 50% of petroleum. Alkanes are a primary 
source of fuel, but they also constitute a significant 
fraction of the carbon pool that is potentially accessible 
for chemical synthesis. It is ironic that such an 
abundant resource is presently so difficult to utilize. 
Methane presents a special problem because of its 
location in remote places and its high volatility. Even 
its use as a fuel is restricted by the expense and 
danger of liquefying it and transporting it from 
discovery to utilization sites. 
Despite the fact that C-H bonds are more difficult 
than other types of linkages to cleave, they are not 
completely inert. Alkanes have long been known to 
undergo a number of solution and gas-phase reactions 
that involve free radicals as intermediates, such as 
photochlorination, autoxidation, and combustion. More 
recently very powerful super acids have been devel- 
oped that are capable of adding protons to alkanes; 
this work was recognized in a Nobel prize to George 
Olah. A critical feature of nearly all of these processes, 
however, is that they are relatively unselective. Two 
types of selectivity are at issue here. The first involves 
the capacity of a potential reagent to attack one type 
of C-H bond in preference to others. For example, 
free radical reagents exhibit some preference for 
reaction of tertiary C-H bonds over primary and 
secondary, but often the degree of selection is not high. 
Reagents that exhibit the reverse preference are 
extremely rare. A second type of selectivity is defined 
as the ability to convert an alkane into a functionalized 
product without having the product undergo even 
faster reaction than the alkane. A classic example of 
this is the oxidation of methane to methanol, which 
is often difficult to carry to high conversion without 
inducing substantial conversion of the methanol to 
more highly oxidized products including COZ and 
water. 
One Holy Grail of C-H activation research, there- 
fore, is not simply to find new C-H activation reac- 
tions but to obtain an understanding of them that will 
allow the development of reagents capable of selective 
transformations of C-H bonds into more reactive 
functionalized molecules. Although a few interesting 
organic and main group reagents have been discovered 
that show intriguing potential for meeting this goal, 
much of the activity in this field has been in transition

metal chemistry. The present Account therefore 
reflects this emphasis. 
Because of space limitations we have had to sub- 
stantially circumscribe the scope of this Account. We 
have chosen to focus on the reactions of saturated 
C-H bonds with soluble synthetic metal complexes 
in homogeneous solution. We have discussed our own 
work, but we have tried to cover the contributions of 
others as well. Although they will be mentioned 
briefly in passing, we have had to largely ignore the 
extensive fields of heterogeneous C-H activation by 
metal surfaces and reactions of alkanes with ions in 
the gas phase, and we mention only briefly the large 
field of biological C-H activation. We also focus 
primarily on intermolecular processes, because they 
are the most difficult to carry out, omitting discussion 
of intramolecular reactions involving interaction of 
C-H bonds and metal centers located in the same 
molecule. The bulk of the Account summarizes what 
has been learned so far about homogeneous metal- 
mediated C-H activation reactions and the Account 
concludes with our thoughts about the "Holy Grails" 
that workers in the C-H activation field would like 
to attain in the future. 
Stoichiometric Reactions of Alkanes with 
Metal Complexes 
Oxidative Addition of C-H Bonds to Late 
Transition Metal Centers. One of the most direct 
ways of obtaining fundamental information about 
C-H activation processes is to uncover and study 
direct stoichiometric 
reactions between metal centers 
and carbon-hydrogen bonds. The first reactions of 
this type that were observed were oxidative addition 
reactions of C-H bonds to late transition metal 
centers (i.e., those lying toward the right side of the 
transition series), leading to hydrido(alky1)metal 
com- 
plexes (eq 1). 
This process, 
formally regarded as a two- 
electron oxidation of the metal, requires that the metal 
possess (1 coordinative 
unsaturation enabling access 
to the metal valence orbitals, (2) electronic unsatura- 
tion for accommodation of the electrons supplied by 
the C and H ligands in the oxidative addition product, 
and (3) an accessible (n + 2) oxidation state. 
This process was not directly observed with simple 
alkanes until 1981. However, a few intermolecular 
alkane C-H activation reactions, discovered earlier 
by workers such as Shilov and Crabtree and discussed 
later in this Account, were postulated to involve such 
oxidative 
addition steps leading 
to hydrido(alky1)metal 
complexes as transient intermediates. 
In the early 1980s, 
our research group and workers 
in the laboratories of Graham and Jones reported the 
first examples of oxidative addition of unactivated 
C-H bonds to transition metal centers that resulted 
in the direct observation of alkyl hydride products.2-6

in a hydrocarbon

or CO (complex 2) and C-H activation of the 
solvent (Scheme 1). 
However, the 16-electron

fragments (M = 
Ir, L = 
PMe3, CO; M = 
Rh, L = 
PMe3) 
believed to be responsible for hydrocarbon oxidative 
addition were not directly observable. 
Since then, a number of second- and third-row late 
transition metal complexes (e.g., 
L2Pt(R)(H), 
L40s(R)- 
(H), (arene)(CO)OsH2, CpReL3, (tris(pyrazoly1)bo- 
rate)RhL(carbodiimide), LaPdBr2) capable of under- 
going reactions that result in oxidative addition of 
alkane C-H bonds have been reported. A single first- 
row example, (DMPEhFeH2 (DMPE = bis(dimeth- 
ylphosphino)ethane), designed after seminal work in 
the C-H activation area carried out at DuPont on 
similar complexes in the iron triad in the 1970s, was 
also discovered. In each of these cases, reactive 
unsaturated fragments analogous to those illustrated 
in Scheme 1 
were presumably generated by loss of 
ligands such as an alkane (RH), H2, CO, Br2, or 
P(CH3)3.'-11 The alkyl hydride products of alkane

C-H insertion by third-row metal fragments are often 
stable at ambient temperatures and can be isolated. 
In contrast, rhodium and iron C-H activation prod- 
ucts decompose rapidly at temperatures above -20 
Unsaturated transition metal centers capable of 
activating strong C-H bonds are exceptionally reac- 
tive. Reactions of these species with alkanes appear 
to be characterized by rapid rates (low 
energy barriers) 
for C-H oxidative addition such that they often cannot 
be observed directly with conventional spectroscopic 
methods. Consequently, the fragments typically react 
with almost every C-H bond, requiring that studies 
detailing the mechanisms of these transformations be 
effected in suitable inert media. Some nonreactive 
solvents that have been employed include the noble 
gases Kr and Xe13-18 and perfluorinated  alkane. 
Mechanistic studies have shown these processes to 
exhibit primary kinetic isotope effects for C-H oxida- 
tive addition that lie in the range 1.5-2.0, indicating 
an early transition state for the r e a  t i o n .    J   l  J   
However, little is known about the roles played by 
alkane complexes (sometimes called a-complexes 
because of their analogy to n-complexes) in determin- 
ing the kinetic selectivity exhibited by a reactive metal 
fragment. These complexes, which arise from interac- 
tion of the C-H bonding electrons with an unfilled 
metal orbital (41, are analogs of dihydrogen and agostic 
complexes.20

gated in our collaborative flash kinetic study with C. 
B. Moore and his co-workers, utilizing liquid xenon 
and liquid krypton as inert solvents.13J5 This work 
provided infrared frequencies for the noble gas sol- 
vates Cp*Rh(CO)(Xe) 
and Cp*Rh(CO)(Kr) 
as well as 
for alkane complexes Cp*Rh(CO)(RH), 
where RH = 
cyclohexane, n-propane, and neopentane. These stud- 
ies also allowed direct measurement of a 4.6 kcaVmol 
activation energy for conversion of the Rh(1) 
cyclohex- 
ane complex Cp*Rh(CO)(C6H12) 
into its C-H-activated 
Rh(1II) product C*R(CO)(CGHI)(H). 
While alkane complexes with complexation energies 
estimated to be on the order of 10 
kcallmol have been 
observed spectroscopically for larger alkanes (e.g., 
cyclohexane, neopentane),13-15 
the corresponding 
meth- 
ane complexes have not been observed in s01ution.l 
This size effect 
seems not to have been examined by 
theorists. If it is real, it may be that theoretical 
methods (which typically predict significant binding 
energies for metal-methane complexes) overestimate 
the metal-alkane binding energy. Clearly, calcula- 
tions involving the formation of complexes between 
larger alkanes and unsaturated transition metal frag- 
ments would be important to help understand the 
effect of alkane size on binding energetics. 
The low kinetic barriers associated with oxidative 
addition of alkanes and arenes to reactive metal 
fragments often lead to little or no kinetic selectivity 
in intermolecular C-H activation experiments, al- 
though intermolecular activation is favored over cy- 
clometalation in most of the cited examples. Mea- 
sured selectivities are scarce in the literature, but 
reported examples generally show higher preferences 
for aryl and primary alkyl C-H bonds (i.e., PhH > 
primary alkyl > cycloalkyl).3892829 
This contrasts 
with selectivities observed for radical reactions which 
show the reverse trend. 
The stoichiometric conversion of C -H activation 
products to functionalized organic compounds is po- 
tentially one step along the road to development of 
catalytic C-H activation processes. However, such 
reactions have been reported in only a few c a  e s  ,  J   
(however, see later sections on catalytic reactions). In 
our laboratory we have found that sequential treat- 
ment of Cp*(PMe3)Ir(R)(H) 
complexes with bromoform 
followed by mercuric chloride resulted in transmeta- 
lation to an organomercury compound, which was 
subsequently converted to an alkyl bromide by treat- 
ment with bromine. Similarly, reaction of analogous 
rhodium complexes with bromoform at -60 C, fol- 
lowed by treatment with Br2 at room temperature, 
afforded bromoalkane. The reaction of (DMPEhFe- 
(pentyl)(H) with bromine yielded 1-bromopentane 
directly. 
Addition of Alkanes to M-X 
Bonds. A second 
important class of C-H activation reactions involves 
addition of C-H bonds across M-X bonds, rather than 
to the metal atom itself (eqs 2 and 3).30-35

tions lead to products in which only one of the alkyl 
or hydrogen fragments is directly attached to the 
metal after the activation process. The reactions 
shown in eqs 2 and 3 typically involve early transition, 
lanthanide, or actinide metal complexes, but a few 
similar processes have been discovered which involve 
late transition metal complexes. 
Metal-Alkyl 0-Bond 
Metathesis. Early transi- 
tion, lanthanide, and actinide metal alkyl and hydride 
complexes capable of activating C-H bonds as shown 
in eq 2 have been actively studied for the past 20 
years.30 Initial investigations were prompted by Erk- 
ers discovery of a zirconium benzyne complex capable 
of activating arene C-H bonds.36 Watson observed 
the first examples of early metal alkane activation 
processes in 1983 
(eq 4) with the scrambling of 13CH4

plexes C P  M - C H  .   ,

Significant work has been aimed at understanding 
the mechanisms of these  activation. The exchange 
processes typically occur at formally do 
metal centers, 
suggesting that oxidative addition to the metal, as 
described for late metals in the Oxidative Addition 
section above, was not a viable mechanism. Kinetic 
studies on these reactions demonstrate first-order rate 
dependence upon the concentrations of both the metal 
complex and the alkane as well as large, negative 
entropies of activation. These suggest an associative 
mechanism and significant organization in the transi- 
tion state.44 In addition, activated deuterated alkane 
substrates show rather large primary kinetic deute- 
rium isotope effects30 ( J Z H /  D  = 3-6), which can be 
interpreted as evidence for significant C-H bond 
cleavage in the transition state. These mechanistic 
data are supportive of a 2 + 2 a-bond metathesis 
mechanism30 
involving a four-center transition state,

Some systems are complicated by a first-order pathway involving 
activation of a Cp* methyl group to form a cyclometalated complex in 
the rate-determining step. The cyclometalated complex then reacts with 
the alkane in a subsequent step.

Such a-bond metathesis mechanisms have been 
suggested previously for the H/D scrambling 
of metal- 
hydride species and the hydrogenation of metal-alkyl 
bonds45,46 
and are supported by theoretical calcula- 
t i o n  .   ,    
The presence of intermediates on the path- 
way to a-bond metathesis, primarily metal-alkane 
complexes similar to those involved in late transition 
metal C-H oxidative addition reactions, has been 
discussed as a pssibility. 
Kinetic evidence in sup- 
port of such intermediates in these systems is not yet 
available. 
In contrast to the behavior of highly reactive un- 
saturated late metal fragments, these a-bond metath- 
esis processes can exhibit marked kinetic selectivities. 
Studies have shown that both electronic and steric 
considerations are important in determining the sub- 
strate reactivity. Bercaw40 
and Marks42 
have shown 
that C-H bonds with more s-orbital character react 
faster than those with more p-orbital character (sp =- 
sp2 > sp3). With -hybridized 
C-H bonds, a-bond 
metathesis reactions show selectivity toward less- 
hindered primary sites (cyclohexane is often used as 
a solvent due to its inert nature). 
In addition 
to these electron deficient 
metal systems, 
recent results in our laboratory indicate that late 
transition metal systems may also be capable of 
alkane activation by a a-bond metathesis mecha- 
n i  m .    
As seen in eq 6, the overall exchange of 
labeled methane into the iridium methyl triflate 
complex, 10, 
is formally the same as that discussed 
above. In addition to alkanes, this system can also

mediate the activation of functionalized substrates 
(Le., ethers, aldehydes, ketones, acetates). Although 
these processes are of potential synthetic utility, they 
are typically not compatible 
with the oxophilic electron 
deficient systems above. Mechanistically, 
we have not 
yet been able to distinguish between the a-bond 
metathesis mechanism and an Ir(III)/Ir(V) 
oxidative- 
additiodreductive-elimination 
mechanism.

to be capable of activating the C-H bonds of methane 
and other alkanes. In analogy to the metal-alkyl 
C-H activation systems described above, the activa- 
tion of C-H bonds by imidometal species is believed 
to occur through a four-center transition state. How- 
ever, in these systems the C-H bond adds across the 
metal-nitrogen multiple bond to generate an (alkyl)- 
(amidolmetal species. 
These reactions are presumed to proceed by mech- 
anisms similar to the ones shown for our and Wolc- 
zanski's zirconium complexes in eqs 7a and 7b. Rate- 
determining alkane elimination (the reverse of alkane 
activation) to generate the reactive imido species is

suggested to occur via a four-center transition state. 
Thus, these reactions are characterized by first-order 
kinetics and small, negative entropies of activa- 
tion.31-33,50,51 
The intermediate imido species 1 
la or 
llb then activates the C-H bond of the substrate. 
Like the systems discussed above, Wolczanski's reac- 
tions exhibit a high degree of selectivity toward 
primary alkyl-hydrogen bonds. Another similarity is 
the rather high kinetic deuterium isotope effects 
observed for the activation of arenes and methanes:

Wolczanski's recent inter- and intramolecular 
isotope effect studies do not support the existence of 
these methane adducts in his imidozirconium sys- 
tem.50 
Although there are several examples of metal alky- 
lidenes (carbon analogs of metal imides) that activate 
C-H bonds intramoleularly, 
no examples of inter- 
molecular C-H activation of alkanes by metal- 
alkylidene species are known. The reverse process, 
a-elimination of dialkyl species to form metal alky- 
lidenes and free alkanes, is well documented, how- 
e  e r . l l ,    
No early metal oxo complexes are known to 
activate alkyl hydrogen bonds. However, manganese- 
(111) and iron(I1) porphyrin species modeled after 
cytochrome P-450 are converted to Mn(V) and Fe(IV) 
metal-oxo species in the presence of oxidizing agents 
such as H202 and PhIO. These late metal oxo com- 
plexes capable of activating C-H bonds will be dis- 
cussed later in this Account. 
Alkane Activation by Metalloradicals. Al- 
though it involves metal rather than organic radicals, 
one other important reaction that should be mentioned 
in this section is the unique porphyrin-based C-H 
activation system discovered by Wayland and his 
group. These researchers have found that paramag- 
netic substituted porphyrin Rh(I1) complexes react 
with methane and certain other hydrocarbons between 
23 and 120 "C to give equimolar amounts (in the

In contrast to both the late transition 
metal oxidative addition and early metal M=X com- 
plexes, none of the porphyrin complexes investigated 
showed any reaction with benzene over a period of 
several weeks at 80 "C. This and other evidence 
suggests that these reactions take place via a linear, 
termolecular transition state in which two metal 
centers participate cooperatively, one attacking the 
methane carbon center and the other abstracting a 
methane hydrogen. To our knowledge this type of 
reaction has so far been found only in this rhodium 
porphyrin system. It would be interesting to know 
whether other paramagnetic complexes exist that will 
activate alkanes by this double-attack mechanism. 
Metal-Catalyzed 
Functionalization of Alkanes 
While the stoichiometric activation of C-H bonds 
with homogeneous metal complexes has been success- 
fully achieved in the past decade, this represents only 
the first step toward the rational development of 
catalytic methods for alkane functionalization. Two 
of the most general non-free radical schemes for 
catalytic C-H functionalization are illustrated in 
Scheme 2. The first involves (a) 
activation of alkane, 
(b) addition of functionality X, and (c) elimination of 
product. The second route requires (d) 
initial metal- 
mediated generation of a reactive functional group 
M=X, (e) addition of a C-H 
bond across the M=X 
bond, and (f, product elimination. Many of the com- 
pounds described in the previous sections that activate 
alkanes do not provide routes to these other steps; 
indeed only in rare cases can the metal mediate 
stoichiometric functinalization., 
The most widely employed alkane functionalization 
catalysts are heterogeneous metal surfaces. While a 
discussion of the chemistry of these systems is outside 
the scope of this Account, it is notable that these 
catalysts are the only ones to have made their way 
into industrial alkane functionalization processes. 
Examples include alkane cracking, methane-to-alcohol 
synthesis, and the conversion of n-butane to maleic 
anhydride.57 
Nevertheless, 
heterogeneous 
alkane func- 
tionalization reactions are typified by stringent condi- 
tions and either poor (e.g., cracking) or poorly under- 
stood (n-butane 
to maleic anhydride) selectivity,

In addition to heterogeneous C-H-activating sys- 
tems, several important homogeneous metal-mediated 
alkane functionalization processes are known. In this 
section we will summarize information that is avail- 
able about the most important of these. 
Radical-Based 
Alkane Functionalization. Bio- 
chemical 
Alkane Oxidation. Nature performs ambient 
temperature alkane functionalization 
continually, 
and 
sometimes with great selectivity, through the use of 
oxygenase enzyme.-O 
Those belonging to the mo- 
nooxygenase cytochrome P-45058259 
and methane mo- 
nooxygenase (MMO) families have received a signifi- 
cant amount of attention. These enzymes catalyze the 
incorporation of molecular oxygen into alkane C-H 
bonds with the concomitant 
loss of water and oxidation 
of NADPH or NADH. In the case of cytochrome P-450, 
the enzyme active site has been found to contain an 
iron porphyrin complex with sulfur-bound cysteine 
(121, 
which mediates the cleavage of 0 2  
to generate 
an iron-oxo complex (13) 
(Scheme 3). This oxo 
complex is considered to be the active oxidant of 
alkane C-H bonds. 
As is typical of much classical alkane chemistry, the 
generally accepted mechanism for this process in- 
volves the intermediacy of alkyl radicals. Intermedi- 
ate 1
3
 
is proposed to abstract a hydrogen atom from 
R-H, generating a caged hydroxoiron(II1) complex/ 
alkyl radical pair (
1

)
.
 
This is followed by an oxygen 
rebound step in which the carbon radical recombines 
with the hydroxide. As might be expected of processes 
that generate R, cytochrome P-450 oxidations typi- 
cally favor oxidation of the weaker tertiary C-H bonds 
over secondary or primary. 
Methane monooxygenase enzymes are active in 
bacterial oxidation of methane to methanol.61,62 
The 
structure of the oxygenating 
catalyst has recently been 
crystallographically determined to contain a diiron 
system with two bridging carboxylate groups and a 
bridging hydroxide (15).63>64

dence that the mechanistic steps by which oxygenation 
occurs are similar to that for the iron-heme P-450 
systems (Scheme 3).65-68 
The hydroxylation of meth- 
ane to methanol by MMO is quite specific, but more 
complicated substrates, such as linear alkanes, typi- 
cally give product mixtures. 
Biomimetic Alkane Oxidation. The efficiency of 
biological oxygenase systems has stimulated a signifi- 
cant body of research devoted to developing both 
structural and functional mimics designed to oxidize 
 alkane.> Groves discovered the first example of 
metalloporphyrin (iron tetraphenylporphyrin) cata- 
lyzed oxidation in 1979, in which cyclohexane was 
oxidized to cyclohexanol using iodosobenzene as a 
sacrificial oxidant.70 Subsequently oxygenation of 
alkanes has been observed with a number of metal- 
loporphyrin systems, with manganese porphyrins 
often the most effiient. 
The oxygen atom sources 
employed in these systems have included iodosoben- 
zene, peroxides, amine oxides, and, in a few cases, 
02.72,73 These processes are considered to proceed by 
a mechanism similar to the enzymatic systems in 
which the oxidant shunts 
the metal to 13. 
However, 
both yields and product distributions vary significantly 
with oxygen-transfer reagent, suggesting that a com- 
mon oxometal complex is unlikely. In general these 
systems are neither as efficient nor as selective 
toward 
alkanes as the natural systems, and more significant 
efforts have lately focused upon their use as olefin 
epoxidation  catalyst., 
In addition to these porphyrin-based monooxygena- 
ses mimics, a number of non-porphyrin systems 
perform similar alkane oxidation functions. It has 
been known since the last century that iron salts 
catalyze the oxidation of alkanes by peroxides (Fenton

 oxidation)., These processes are considered to 
involve the iron-catalyzed homolysis of hydrogen 
peroxide followed by hydrogen abstraction and radical 
recombination (eq 9). Because the metals are involved 
only in the generation of hydroxyl radicals, and the 
chemical properties and (relatively nonspecific) selec- 
tivities observed are those characteristic of this inter- 
mediate, this class of reactions is normally not con- 
sidered to be a true metal-mediated C-H activation 
process.

A significant extension of these iron-catalyzed oxi- 
dations was first observed in 1983 
by Barton and co- 
workers, who used iron powder and dioxygen in 
pyridine solvent to effect the facile oxidation of ada- 
mantane to adamantanne. 
Subsequent studies on 
several variations of this system (christened "Gif" 
oxidations by Barton for his location at Gif-sur-Yvette 
where the discovery was made) have demonstrated 
that iron salts in the presence of a reducing agent, or 
in combination with peroxides, can effect the catalytic 
oxidation of alkanes, sometimes with interesting 
selectivities. Addition of anion salts (e.g., X- = C1-, 
Br-, N3-, SCN-) to these systems has been found to 
lead to the catalytic formation of the corresponding 
alkyl-X c o m p o  n d s .       
The mechanism of these 
oxidations is still a matter of some debate.81-83 Nev- 
ertheless, there appears to be strong evidence for at 
least partial involvement of hydrogen abstraction by 
alkoxy radicals, followed by iron-mediated functional 
group transfer.81 
Metal-Based 
Alkane Functionalization. In con- 
trast to the alkane activation systems outlined above, 
many (or possibly all) of which involve the interme- 
diacy of radicals, several transition metal alkane 
transformation systems have been uncovered in which 
both C-H bond cleavage and functionalization are 
believed to occur at the metal center. Because they 
are non-radical based, these systems typically exhibit 
selectivities different from those mentioned above and 
often result in preferential activation of thermody- 
namically stronger primary C-H bonds. Such pro- 
cesses typically involve late metal systems, largely 
because the metal center not only must catalyze the 
activation of the C-H bond but also must be compat- 
ible with the functionalizing substrate. 
Alkane Oxidations. One of the oldest examples of 
metal-mediated functionalization is the oxidation of 
alkanes by platinum chloride salts. The addition of 
alkanes, including methane, to a mixture of HzPtCls 
and NazPtCll was noted by Shilov in the 1960s to lead 
to the generation of both alkyl halides and a l  o h o l s .       
It has subsequently been noted that Pt(I1) 
will perform 
Arndtsen et al. 
this oxidation by itself,s6 and in the presence of 
oxidant, a small number of catalytic turnovers have 
been noted.87 Labinger and Bercaw have extended 
this process to the hydroxylation of functionalized 
systems (e.g., 
the activation of the /?-carbon in ethanol 
to give ethylene glycols8) 
and have investigated the 
mechanism of the p r o  e s s .       
Their results suggest 
that initial reaction of Pt(IV) with the C-H bond 
generates an alkylplatinum intermediate, which then 
undergoes nucleophilic attack at carbon by either 
chloride or hydroxide. While the direct oxidation of 
alkanes with Pt salts is limited in its catalytic ability, 
the activation of alkanes with similar palladium 
systems in the presence of carbon monoxide has been 
reported to result with high turnover numbers in 
carboxylated p r o d  c t s .       
The carboxylation of methane to acetic acid was 
observed recently by Sen and co-workers to be cata- 
lyzed by RhC13 under aqueous conditions with the use 
of 0 2  
as the oxidant (eq 
It is thought that this 
reaction proceeds via a Rh-CH3 complex, analogous 
to the Pd systems above, though little direct mecha- 
nistic information is available. Unfortunately, no 
mention was made of the yield of acetic acid based on 
methane consumed (i.e., 
how much acetic acid relative 
to overoxidized products such as CO and COZ 
was 
formed), 
which would affect the potential utility of the 
reaction.

In addition to alkane carboxylation, photochemical 
conversions of alkanes to aldehydes have also been 
observed. These reactions were first catalyzed by 
ClRh(PMed2CO (16) in the presence of pentane and 
CO to yield exclusively 1-hexanal (eq 11).94,95 
Recent 
mechanistic studies by Goldman have provided evi- 
dence that the CO-dissociated species, although present, 
is not the C-H-activating intermediate. Goldman has 
suggested that the primary photoprocess in this 
system involves direct C-H oxidative addition to the 
four-coordinate Rh(1) center to generate a six-coordi- 
nate complex, which then undergoes CO insertion in 
a subsequent step.96

Selective Intermolecular C-H Bond Activation 
ACC. 
Chem. Res., Vol. 28, No. 3, 1995 161 
112 kcaUmo1 above the ground state, it has sufficient 
energy to cause homolytic cleavage of unactivated 
C-H bonds, leading to alkyl radicals and hydrogen 
atoms.lo3J04 
The alkyl radicals then dimerize, 
leading 
to coupled products. As expected for such radical 
reactions, selectivities strongly favor tertiary C-H 
bonds and exhibit high primary isotope effects. 
Crabtree has recently revived research in this area 
by carrying out experiments under preparative condi- 
tions in the presence of equilibrating vapor and liquid 
phases. Under these conditions mercury sensitization 
takes place only in the gas phase, and the alkane 
dimerization products are not converted to higher 
molecular weight oligomers because they condense to 
less volatile liquids, physically removing them from 
exposure to light in the vapor-phase 
reaction zone.105J06 
This process has been successfully employed to pre- 
pare a number of cycloalkane dimers, as well as 
dimers and cross-products involving alcohols, ethers, 
and silanes. 
Activation of primary C-H bonds, such as those of 
methane, is generally difficult with triplet mercury, 
but Crabtree has recently reported that addition of 
ammonia (N-H bond strength 107 kcaVmo1) to Hgl 
CH4 systems leads to methane activation and imine 
formation.lo7J08 
This is considered to result from a 
strong bonding interaction between amines and mer- 
cury (Hg*-NH3), which leads to efficient energy 
transfer and N-H bond homolysis. The H and NH2 
radicals can then abstract hydrogen from methane and 
through radical recombination yield imine products. 
This amine system has also been applied to the 
efficient amination of cycloalkanes. 
Very recently a new non-photochemical methane 
activation method based on mercury salts has been 
reported. Periana has found that Hg(I1) salts in CF3- 
S03H (trifluoromethanesulfonic 
or triflic 
acid) cata- 
lyze the conversion of methane to methyl triflate 
(which can be subsequently hydrolyzed to methanol) 
in high yield and selectivity under relatively mild 
conditions.log The key to this system seems to be the 
electron-withdrawing character of the triflate group, 
which stabilizes the initial product and prevents its 
overoxidation to formaldehyde, formic acid, and C02. 
It seems likely that analogous non-mercury-based 
methods will follow this initial discovery. Although 
no information is yet available as to whether selective 
catalytic oxygenation of higher hydrocarbons can be 
carried out using this method, it constitutes a novel 
approach that holds out real promise for direct indus- 
trial-scale conversion of methane to methanol. 
bond, the conversion of alkanes to olefins by metal 
complexes also represents their formal functionaliza- 
tion, in this case through the removal of H2. This 
process was first noted by Crabtree in 1979 to occur 
stoichiometrically with [IrH2(PPh3)2(aetone)2I+X-? 
Subsequent studies showed that addition of 3,3- 
dimethylbutene to this system, to act as a hydrogen 
collector and thus drive the endothermic loss of Hz, 
resulted in the catalytic 
generation of dehydrogenation 
products.98 
Alkane dehydrogenation was also observed to be 
mediated by RhCl(PMed2CO 
(16) 
photochemically, 
the 
complex described in the alkane oxidation section 
above that leads to alkane carbonylation under pho- 
tochemical conditions. This reaction, reported by both 
Tanakag9 
and Saito,loo 
leads again to the generation 
of monoalkenes with turnovers ranging up to several 
hundred. 
lol 
Mechanistically, this process is considered to pro- 
ceed by photochemical extrusion of CO, followed by 
thermal steps that involve C-H oxidative addition, 
@-hydride 
elimination, and finally dissociation of the 
product olefin. Goldman has recently taken advan- 
tage of the reversibility of the hydrogen-for-CO ligand 
substitution to develop a method for the thermal 
dehydrogenation of alkanes catalyzed by 16 and 
related systems.lo2 In this reaction dihydrogen and 
3,3-dimethylbutene 
are added to the system, 
providing 
a catalytic dehydrogenation with the sacrificial olefin 
serving to remove H2. This system is more active than 
that observed by Crabtree, and the use of [RhLzC112 
leads to turnovers of several hundredhour. As with 
other dehydrogenation systems, selectivity for various 
C-H bonds is generally lacking, and clean olefin 
synthesis requires the use of cyclic alkanes. 
Mercury and Mercuric Salts in Alkane Func- 
tionalization. A metal that has achieved increased 
prominence in C-H activation chemistry recently is 
mercury. One example is the triplet mercury-photo- 
sensitized activation of alkanes, leading to dimeriza- 
tion and direct functionalization. Although this re- 
action is not photocatalytic (i.e., the quantum yield is 
not above LO), 
the process does not consume mercury 
and so it is catalytic in metal. Crabtree has made a 
persuasive case that the simplicity of the system 
greatly enhances its utility. 
The photosensitization 
process is thought to proceed 
by photoexcitation of a Hg atom, which quickly crosses 
over to its lowest triplet state. Because the triplet lies

The Future 
As we hope has been made clear in the foregoing

many things have been learned about C-H

number of Holy Grails remain to be found. We

emphasize that these research targets include those 
that are both basic and applied. Moving from rela- 
tively fundamental to more practical goals, we cite the 
following challenges as a hopefully stimulating, but 
certainly noninclusive, list. 
The C-H activation research area needs a better 
understanding of the factors that control the rate, 
selectivity, isotope effects, and stereochemistry of C-H 
activation processes and of the nature and role of 
alkane complexes. We require better insight into why 
some metals undergo C-H activation and why some 
do not, and an improvement in the level of reliability 
associated with theoretical predictions of energy sur- 
faces for C-H activation, especially for relatively 
complex molecules. Still perplexing is the relationship 
of heterogeneous and biological catalysts to those that 
can be prepared in the laboratory, as well as the 
challenge of synthesizing soluble complexes that will 
mimic the C-H activation behavior of their solid and 
biological relatives. 
Exploratory goals include the search for new types 
of C-H activating systems. Waylands termolecular 
rhodium porphyrin reactions, our late transition metal 
Ir(II1) apparent a-bond metathesis reactions, and 
Perianas Hg(II)/CF3S03H systems are examples of 
new types of C-H activation reactions that have come 
to light relatively recently. We expect that the search 
for analogues of these reactions, as well as for com- 
pletely new classes of C-H activation processes, will 
be fruitful. We also anticipate the appearance of new 
Arndtsen et al. 
ligands that will convert nonreactive metals into 
reactive ones, allow conversion of C-H-activated 
products into functionalized organic compounds (e.g., 
oxidation-resistant ligands), and provide methods for 
carrying out enantioselective C-H activation. 
Although progress has been made on the develop- 
ment of catalytic alkane functionalization methods, 
the community still awaits the development of truly 
robust, high-yield, high-turnover catalysts for alkane 
functionalization that can be employed on a large 
scale. The triflic acid system (perhaps with some 
metal other than mercury) may ultimately result in 
an effective methane-to-methanol process, but differ- 
ent types of catalysts will probably be required to 
convert higher hydrocarbons selectively into, for ex- 
ample, primary alcohols. Within this general goal lie 
methods for selective conversion of C-H activated 
metal complexes to functional groups of choice and 
conversion of methane to longer-chain hydrocarbons 
for use as synthetic intermediates or liquid fuels. We 
have no doubt that substantial progress will be made 
on the search for these Holy Grails as this field 
continues to expand.
