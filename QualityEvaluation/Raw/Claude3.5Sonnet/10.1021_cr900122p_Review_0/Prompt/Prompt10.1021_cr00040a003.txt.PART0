1. Introduction 
In this review what is known about the chemistry 
of hydrocarbon molecules on transition metal sur- 
faces will be surveyed. A battery of new surface 
science techniques has been used to study the solid- 
gas interface, but only recently has a picture started 
to emerge for the surface chemistry of adsorbed 
organic molecules. Even though a few reviews have 
already been published on this 
a compre- 
hensive and systematic description of these systems 
is still lacking. Here we will discuss the results 
reported to date on the structure and reactivity of 
the different types of hydrocarbon moieties that form 
on transition metal surfaces. One of the goals of this 
review is to provide an organometallic guide for the 
possible interactions of hydrocarbons with transition 
metals with the idea of examining their relation to 
the corresponding surface chemistry. We will how- 
ever limit our review of the organometallic literature 
to the information relevant to the surface systems, 
and also narrow the field to cover only molecules with 
carbon and hydrogen atoms; compounds containing 
other atoms (0, 
S, N) will be excluded. 
It is our belief that there is a close relation between 
organic ligands in organometallic compounds and 
their counterparts on solid surfaces in terms of both 
structure and reactivity. Even though physicists 
originally described the behavior of metals in terms 
of a completely delocalized electronic structure, later 
studies have differentiated between the sp delocalized 
band responsible for the electrical conductivity and 
other physical properties of the metals and the d 
electrons, which were found to be reasonably local- 
ized in terms of both energy and space (Figure l).6-9 
Since the chemistry of most transition metals is 
dominated by their d orbitals, the localization of those 
orbitals around the individual atoms of a solid surface 
is then expected 
to lead to localized bonding. Several 
experimental observations have proven this true in 
many systems. For one, the vibrational normal 
modes associated with bonds between surfaces and 
adsorbates usually display well-defined frequency 
value,O- 
and there are well-defined electronic

highlights both

analogy between surface and organometallic systems. 
levels associated with those bonds as 
In 
addition, molecules chemisorbed on single crystals 
often arrange themselves in periodic patterns in 
registry with the substrate 
structure; analysis ofthe 
diffraction patterns obtained from those systems 
show that the local geometry of the adsorbed mol- 
ecules is well defined.16.17 
All this means that, to a 
first approximation, we can expect to see the same 
type of organic moieties on surfaces and in organo- 
metallic systems. This analogy has of course some 
limitations, since there are other parameters that 
need to be taken into consideration when interpreting 
the chemistry observed in both surfaces and discrete 
compounds, namely, coordination numbers (or the 
Zaera 
number of metal atoms bonded to one molecule), the 
effect of ligands on the electronic structure of the 
central atom, and steric effects. Surfaces may also 
offer additional bonding sites not available in discrete 
clusters and can even reconstruct to accommodate 
adsorbates. We will address those issues briefly in 
this review as well. 
The present review is organized in the following 
manner. First, a brief discussion of the experimental 
techniques used to characterize both organometallic 
and surface systems is presented. A discussion of the 
coordination and structure of the different types of 
organic moieties, first in organometallic compounds 
and then on metal surfaces, follows. Here the 
systems are classified according to the type of bond- 
ing between the molecules and the metals: both u- 
and n-bonded ligands are described according to their 
coordination number. Next, the different elementary 
steps that such systems can undergo are sum- 
marized: C-H and C-C bond-breaking and bond- 
forming 
reactions, isomerizations, 
and others. Again, 
the chemistry of organometallic compounds is dis- 
cussed first, and the surface chemistry is presented 
subsequently. A brief description of a few key 
nonelementary reactions is also given, including some 
catalytic processes. Lastly, a brief discussion on the 
main similarities and differences found so far be- 
tween surface and organometallic systems, and on 
possible future directions for this field, is offered.

 Experimental Methods 
Even though bonding in most chemisorption sys- 
tems is localized, the different local structures 
of the 
metal atoms present on the surface of a given solid 
make these systems intrinsically more complex than 
their organometallic analogs. The use of single 
crystals with well-characterized structures 
has there- 
fore been adopted in recent years in order to simplify 
surface studies. In addition, most chemisorption 
experiments are nowadays performed under so-called 
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) 
conditions, that is, under 
pressures in the 10-9-10-10 
T
o

range, in order to 
keep the substrates clean for reasonably long periods 
of 
This is the type of work reviewed here. 
The characterization of organometallic systems 
relies on well-developed techniques such as 
X-ray and 
neutron diffraction, NMR, 
and infrared spectroscopies. 
Unfortunately, most of those probes are not ap- 
plicable to the small single-crystal systems 
described 
above. A group of alternative surface-sensitive tech- 
niques based on the use of electrons and other 
particles has been developed in recent years for 
surface studies. These include low-energy electron 
diffraction (LEED) and surface-extended X-ray ab- 
sorption fine structure ( S E W S )  
for structural de- 
terminations, photoelectron (UPS 
and XF'S), electron 
energy-loss (EELS) 
and work function measurements 
for characterization of electronic levels, secondary ion 
mass (SIMS), 
Auger electron (AES) 
and ion scattering 
(ISS) 
spectroscopies for compositional analysis, high- 
resolution electron energy-loss (HREELS) 
and reflec- 
tion-absorption infrared (RAIRS) spectroscopies for 
vibrational studies, and temperature-programmed 
desorption (TPD) 
for reactivity determinations, to 
name a few.zo.21 
Unfortunately, none of those tech- 
Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties 
niques is yet capable of providing the information 
necessary for reaching the type of definitive conclu- 
sions regarding the structure or the reactivity of 
chemisorbed moieties that are typical in inorganic 
chemistry. This is why a good understanding of both 
the similarities and the differences between surface 
and organometallic systems is crucial in developing 
the chemical intuition needed to interpret the data 
from surface studies.

Evidence for the 
formation of alkyl moieties after this bond-scission 
step comes from a range of techniques, mostly X-ray 
photoelectron (XPS), 
static secondary ion mass 
(SSIMS), and vibrational (HREELS and RAIRS) 
spectroscopies.39-424g52-54687475 
According to data 
from infrared experiments, the alkyl chains initially 
orient themselves flat on the surface in order to 
maximize their interaction with the metal, but reori- 
ent to a perpendicular configuration at higher cover- 
ages, presumably because van der Waals interactions 
between the hydrocarbon chains dominate in that 
regime.44,51,64,76 
There is no direct information on 
either the bonding geometry or the coordination of 
the alkyl groups to the surface available to date. On 
the one hand, both the low metal-carbon stretching 
frequency observed in vibrational s t  d i e s   -    
and 
some theoretical calculations80-82 
suggest that alkyls 
may adsorb on hollow sites, but other calculations 
explain the experimental results by an on-top con- 
figuration i n  t e a d .   ,    
There have been several attempts to develop 
alternative synthetic routes for alkyl groups on metal 
surfaces. A few research groups have used chemi- 
sorbed azocompounds as alkyl precursors, but since 
the surface chemistry of those compounds is far more 
complex than initially expected, there have been no 
cases where alkyl moieties have been produced 
cleanly in this manner.85-91 A second approach 
consists of dosing alkyl radicals produced in the gas 
phase by decomposition 
of the same azocompounds.9293 
This route has proven to work quite well for generat- 
ing methyl groups, but has so far not been extended 
to other alkyl moieties. A third method involves the 
preparation of alkyl groups by using alkane molec- 
ular beams,94 
but again, only methyl moieties have 
been synthesized this way. Other attempted proce- 
dures include the soft landing of alkyl cations,95 
the 
direct deposition of organometallic complexes con- 
taining alkyl ligand,-OO 
the hydrogenation of ole- 
fins, either with gaseous hydrogen atom via an Eley- 
Rideal reaction,lol or by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
mechanism with adsorbed hydrogen,lo2 
and the bom- 
bardment of adsorbed alkanes with low-energy elec- 
t r o n  .     
All these methods are in their initial stages 
of development. 
Finally, a few words need to be said about the 
stability of alkyl fragments. As mentioned earlier, 
metal-carbon 
c
7
 bonds are not inherently weak; 
compounds with alkyl ligands are kinetically un- 
stable only because there are a number of decomposi- 
tion routes readily available to them.lo4J05 
The 
metal-carbon dissociation energy for gas-phase 
metal-CH3 fragments ranges from about 30 kcaVmo1 
(for Mn and Fe) to 60 kcaYmol (for Ni and Cu).lo6 
In 
organometallic compounds those energies vary from 
28 kcal/mol in Pt(CH2)3C12107 
to 30 kcal/mol in 
Mn(CH3)(C0)5,18 
39 kcaVmol in Pt(CH3)3(r5-CsH),lo9 
and 53 kcal/mol in Re(CH3)(C0)5.18 
On surfaces, to 
the best of our knowledge, values for metal-alkyl 
bond energies exist only for methyl and ethyl moi- 
eties, and only for surfaces of four transition metals,

1. Alkyls 
The synthesis of organometallic compounds with 
alkyl ligands via the direct oxidative addition (C-H 
bond scission) of saturated hydrocarbons to metal 
atoms is in general not practical because of the low 
reactivity of those alkanes. There are, however, 
several easier routes for the synthesis of alkyl-metal 
organometallic complexes, such as, for instance, the 
oxidative addition of alkyl halides to metal  center.- 
For years metal alkyls other than (CH&PtI could not 
be isolated, but it is now known that this was not 
due to a weak metal-carbon bond, but to the fact 
that there are a number of facile decomposition 
pathways available for these compounds (which will 
be discussed later). By coordinating deactivating 
ligands to the metal center, many alkyl metallic 
compounds have been isolated since. 
Most alkyl groups form a single c
7
 bond with one 
metal atom through a two-electron donation, and 
occupy a single coordination site. However, there are 
also cases where those groups bond to multicenter 
complexes in a bridge configuration. Bridging alkyl 
groups are common among main-group elements 
such as aluminum,26 
but have also been observed in 
a few transition metal complexes. There seems to 
be a competition between this bridging of alkyl 
groups, which has been seen mainly with first-row 
metals, and the formation of metal-metal multiple 
bonds, which is favored by 4d and 5d  element.- 
Apart from the simplest bridging configuration pos- 
sible, via a two-electron three-center bond between 
the metals and the carbon atom,27-29 
two other types 
of bridging compounds have been observed with 
transition metals, one where the carbon atom coor- 
dinates to one of the metal atoms while the C-H 
bond displays an agostic interaction with a second, 
and another where the alkyl group is in a planar 
configuration, sandwiched between the two metal.O- 
Alkyl halide insertion reactions can also be induced 
on transition metal surfaces.33 There have been a 
large number of studies reported recently on the 
chemistry of simple alkyl halides over well-defined 
surfaces for a variety of transition metals, including

At liquid nitrogen temper- 
atures alkyl halides usually adsorb molecularly, but 
in most cases they can be easily activated, either 
thermally3 
or phtolytically, 
to produce alkyl groups 
on the surface. The cleavage of C-I bonds in 
particular generally requires activation energies of

cases the metal-carbon energy is approximately 30 
kcallmol. The numbers listed above are within the 
range predicted by extrapolating the known values 
for M-N and M-0 bond strengths, and are suf- 
ficiently large to allow for the isolation of alkyl 
complexes provided that their decomposition can be 
suppressed. Also worth noticing is the fact that the 
bond energies for a given metal have similar values 
regardless of the type of system being studied, 
whether it is a gas-phase radical, a gas or a liquid 
organometallic complex, or a hydrocarbon moiety 
adsorbed on a solid surface, as long as the oxidation 
state of the metal is not changed. Finally, it is 
interesting to point out that, at least in the case of 
copper, the metal-methyl bond energy (33 
kcallmol) 
is much closer to that for the cation Cu-CH3+ (30 
kcallmol) 
than for the neutral Cu-CH3 molecule (58 
kcavmol), and since the main difference 
between the 
two gas-phase molecules is the lack of s electrons in 
the ionized metal, it could be argued that on the 
surface the alkyl-metal bond involves an s electron 
from the metal.

2. Vinyls, Acetylides, and Aryls 
In addition to alkyl groups, unsaturated hydrocar- 
bons can also a bond to one or more metal centers to 
form alkenyl (vinyl), alkynyl (acetylide), or aryl 
ligands. Homoleptic vinyl complexes (containing 
only 
one type of ligand) are common among main ele- 
ments,114J15 
but rare on transition m e t a l  .    J  '  
Other 
vinyl compounds can be prepared by oxidative addi- 
tion of vinyl halides,118-120 
by insertion of coordinated 
acetylene,121J22 
by transmetalation,122 
or by decar- 
bonylation of acrylic compounds.123 
When coordi- 
nated to one metal center, the metal-carbon bond 
has a pure a character,l17 but this type of ligand is 
more commonly seen in clusters, and in those com- 
pounds an additional interaction between the n 
orbital and a second metal atom is usually ob- 
There are, to the best of our knowledge, only four 
examples where vinyl groups have been cleanly 
isolated and well characterized on solid transition- 
metal surfaces. In one case the vinyl moieties were 
prepared by thermal dehydrogenation of ethylene on 
Ni(100) around 175 K. The formation of the surface 
vinyl species was first inferred from laser-induced 
desorption (LID) kinetic experiments with partially 
labeled 
and later confirmed using 
vibrational spectroscopy.128 
By using near-edge 
X-ray 
absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS), the C-C axis 
was determined to be at 35" 
to the surface normal, 
and the molecular plane oriented at 60" from that 
surface (Figure 2).129 Although the exact coordina- 
tion of the carbon to the surface was not determined, 
the observed geometry does suggest some n 
interac- 
tion with the metal surface. The other examples 
come from recent reports on the synthesis of vinyl 
groups by direct decomposition 
of chemisorbed vinyl 
halides on Pt(lll),130J31 
CU(OO),' 
and Ag(111P 
surfaces. Other reports claim to have isolated sur- 
face vinyl species after either electron bombard- 
ment133 
or thermal decompsitionlJ 
of adsorbed 
ethylene, on Ag(ll1) and Pt(100), respectively, but

These data were 
used to determine that vinyl moieties bond to the surface 
with their molecular plane at 60" and their C-C bond tilted 
about 35" from the normal. 
copy data presented in those cases was not ac- 
companied by any structural or vibrational charac- 
terization of the surface species. 
Acetylide compounds behave in general in a way 
similar to that of the vinyl counterparts. Acetylides 
are most often prepared either by substitution of a 
coordinated halide with an acetylenic anion (such as 
in a Grignard reagent),23 
or by the oxidative addition 
of the acetylenic 
C-H bond in coordinated alkenes.136 
The metal-carbon bond in mononuclear acetylide 
compounds 
has a single a 
character,137 
but in clusters 
these a-bonded acetylides are capable of additional 
n 
bonding with neighboring metal atoms.138 The 
stability of the mononuclear compounds depends on 
the nature of the R group in the p position, which 
follow the order aryl > hydrogen > 
These 
changes can be explained by the greater electro- 
negativity of aryl groups compared to that of either 
H or alkyls and by the reduction in negative charge 
of the triple bond in the aryl case by virtue of its 
resonant delocalization. Many acetylides tend to 
polymerize, and acetylides of the form M2C2 are 
frequently explosive, 
especially when the metal is Cu, 
Ag, or A U .    
The formation of acetylides 
on metal substrates has 
usually been seen in association with the decomposi- 
tion of chemisorbed ethylene, acetylene, or benzene 
molecules, but in most cases the evidence offered for 
the presence of this moiety on the surface has not 
been compelling. High-resolution electron energy- 
loss spectroscopic (HREELS) data has been inter- 
preted as to indicate the presence of acetylide moi- 
eties in the following cases: (1) 
after decomposition 
of ethylene on Pd(ll1) and Pd(100) at 450

and Rh(lll).148 
Although these assignments have 
been based on only a few vibrational modes, the 
proposed structures are consistent with similar clus- 
ter compounds. 
Finally, there are a substantial number of known 
a-bonded transition metal aryl  compound.- 
Transition metal aryl bonds can be made by a variety 
of synthetic methods, such as the use of aryl Grig- 
nard, lithium, or mercury r e a g e n t  , l   J    
and the 
oxidative addition of aryl h a l i d e  l   - l    
(or even aryl 
C-H bonds157) 
to metal complexes. The monometal- 
lic compounds usually display M-C distances typical 
of single bonds, but in a few cases a considerable 
shortening of this bond has been found,15s 
presum- 
ably because of the significant amount of back 
donation of the metal d electrons into the n
*
 
phenyl 
orbital. Aryl compounds are quite reactive, readily 
converting to biphenyl derivatives and other prod- 
u c t  .     
The decomposition mechanism for this is not 
well understood, but seems to involve the hydrogens 
in the ortho position, because adding ortho substit- 
uents to an aryl ligand results in a higher kinetic 
stability of the organometallic compound.23 Aryl 
compounds are also believed to be intermediates in 
the formation of y6-arene 
complexes in some cases.149 
Almost no examples are known for aryl fragments 
on surfaces. Thus far phenyl groups have been 
prepared via the decomposition of halobenzenes on 
copper, silver, and nickel  u r f a c e s ,   O -

6. Multiple Metal-Carbon 0 Bonding 
1. Carbenes 
Saturated hydrocarbon moieties can also bond to 
metal centers via multiple a bonds. For example, 
CR2 fragments can coordinate directly to one metal 
atom in organometallic complexes to form what 
nominally would be a double bond.167J68 
These 
compounds are generically called carbenes, but in 
cases where the R groups are composed exclusively 
of carbon and hydrogen atoms they are referred as 
either alkylidenes or (substituted) methylidenes. 
There are in fact two types of metal-carbene com- 
plexes, those where bonding occurs through the 
donation of the electron lone pair of the carbene free 
radical into the d orbitals of the metal (the so-called 
Fischer type),167 
and those in which the double bond 
is formed by the sharing of electrons between the 
carbon and the metal atom(s) (the Schrock type).169 
This separation is more than just a question of 
semantics, since each type displays a quite distinct 
reactivity pattern. The "true carbene" (Fischer) 
type 
is stabilized by keeping the metal in a low oxidation 
state, and is readily attacked by nucleophilic reagents 
at the carbene carbon atom. The Schrock type, on 
the other hand, exists mostly in metals in high 
oxidation states and can react either with an elec- 
trophilic reagent at the carbon atom or with a 
nucleophilic group at the metal  e n t e r .   J  O  
The 
difference can alternatively be viewed in terms of the 
nature of the interaction between the ligand and the 
metal: while the first type is formed by electrophilic 
carbene ligands which exist as singlets in their free 
radical state, the second type, the most common for 
alkylidenes, originates from nucleophilic radicals in 
their triplet, most stable gas-phase state.llg 
Single-metal carbene compounds are fairly un- 
stable and commonly require the presence of at least 
one element other than carbon (usually oxygen, 
sulfur, or nitrogen) on the carbene carbon.16s There 
are very few examples of stable monometallic alkyl- 
idene complexes,171 
even though a theoretical study 
does suggest that the carbene-metal bond energy 
should be of the order of 50 kcallmol, higher than that 
in coordinated ethylene, acetylene, N2, or C0.172J73 
Some Schrock carbene complexes with less than 18 
electrons are further stabilized by having the proton 
on the carbene atom bend backward toward the 
metal, so the C-H bond becomes longer and interacts 
strongly with the metal center while the metal- 
carbon double bond becomes  h 0 r t e r . l    
A more stable form of carbenes exists in metal 
clusters with the carbon atom bonded in a bridge 
configuration between two metal atoms.175 
Bridged 
methylenic structures can be prepared by the addi- 
tion of a variety of reactants to metal complexes, 
including dihalo a l k a n e  , l   J    
diazo compounds,178 
and even ketenes,179 
although the use of this last 
reagent is not advisable because of its lack of 
selectivity. A few additional indirect synthetic meth- 
ods, such as the addition of olefins and acetylenes 
and the use of organolithium and dimethyl magne- 
sium reagents, have been reported in the literature 
as well.175 The bridging carbene structures are 
usually symmetric, with an internal M-C-M angle 
of about 80" and an external R-C-R 
angle around 
105". Molecular orbital calculations have revealed 
an electronic structure for these systems best de- 
scribed by a CR2 unit formally added to a metal- 
metal double bond: apart from a 0 
donation from the 
methylene group into the metal orbitals, there is also 
an electron transfer from the M-M a bond to a 
carbon orbital with n 
symmetry which reduces the 
formal metal-metal bond from double to single 
character.lgO This interpretation is supported by 
results from photoelectron spectroscopy experi- 
ments.ls1 
There have only been a handful of examples 
reported for the isolation and characterization of 
alkylidene groups on solid surfaces. Vibrational 
spectroscopic data from studies on the decomposition 
of diazo methane on Ru(0001) 
were initially assigned 
to the formation of methylene on the surface,182 
but 
later reinterpreted as possibly resulting from dimer- 
ization to ethylene. Additional vibrational results 
have been reported for methylene formation from 
ketene on Fe(l10),lg3 
R U ( O O O  ) ,     
and Pt(lll),185 
and 
from diiodo methane on Rh(111)lS6 
and M o (   O ) . '

In most cases the decomposition of the precursor 
takes place at low temperatures: methylene forma- 
tion from either ketene or diazo methane on Ru- 
(OOOl), or from diazo methane on Pt(lll), occurs 
immediately upon adsorption around 100 K, and 
C-C bond scission in ketene takes place below 150 
K on Pt(ll1). The decomposition of CHzIz is pre- 
sumed to be equally facile; it probably occurs below 
200 K. Only in the case of ketene on Fe(ll0) has 
methylene formation 
been proposed to occur at 
higher 
temperatures (still below 390 K). Ethylidene moi- 
eties have also been isolated and characterized by 
infrared spectroscopy a h r  
thermal activation of 1,l- 
diiodoethane on Pt(lll).lg4 
2. Cahynes 
Similar to C& moieties, it is also possible to attach 
CR groups directly to metal atoms. The resulting 
complexes are called carbynes in general, and alkyl- 
idynes when R is a carbon-containing fragment. As 
in the case of carbenes, it is also possible to dif- 
ferentiate 
between 
two types of coordination, namely, 
one in which the carbyne donates its two free 
electrons in the sp orbital to the metal center@) 
and 
shares the third p electron with three other in two 
of the d orbitals of the metal, and another in which 
it forms what would be nominally considered LL tnple 
bond by sharing its three electrons (one in each of 
the one sp and two p orbitals) w

There have been reports of stable alkylidyne com- 
pounds in complexes with one170Js5 
and tw0138J96 
metal centers, but by far the most stable type is one 
where the alkylidyne is located at the center of the 
triangle formed by three metal  atom.'-' These 
compounds can be prepared by using the correspond- 
ing l,l,l-trihaloalkanes, by decomposition of acety- 
lenic or alkylidene complexes, or by substitution of 
R groups in existing alkylidyne compounds.1s8 Their 
electronic configuration is still a matter of some 
debate, but it is by and large believed that the carbon 
atom attached to the metal is sp hybridized and 
bonds to all three metal atoms via delocalized mo- 
lecular orbitals.2020'

also quite common in chemi- 
sorption systems. CH groups may form via the

The three vibrational modes characteristic 
of ethylidyne moieties are clearly seen here, namely, the 
C-C stretching at 1118 em-', the symmetric methyl 
deformation (umbrella mode) at 1339 em-', and the sym- 
metric C-H stretching at 2883

C-C bond parallel to the surface normal, (2) 
the C-C 
bond distances are on the order of 1.50 A, 
close to 
those of single bonds in organic compounds; (3) the 
most intense and characteristic vibration seen in all 
cases is the symmetric methyl deformation (um- 
brella) mode at about 1335-1360 cm-', the same as 
in discrete organometallic complexes; (4) 
the bonding 
to the surface is most likely through a simultaneous 
donation of electrons from a carbon p orbital perpen- 
dicular to the metal d band (a1 
symmetry) 
and a back- 
donation of metal d electrons to an empty carbon p 
orbital parallel to the surface (e symmetry). A recent 
microcalorimetric study of ethylidyne on (1 
x2)-Pt- 
(110) estimates the overall binding energy of the 
metal-carbon interaction to be about 160 kcaVmo1.222 
The formation of larger alkylidynes (n-propylidyne, 
n-butylidyne, isobutylidyne, and n-pentylidyne) by 
thermal conversion of the corresponding olefins was 
initially inferred from TPD and LEED r e s  l t s *   -   
and later corroborated by vibrational spectros- 
copy.146226-229 
Studies on long-chain alkylidyne have 
so far been carried out only on Pt(lll), 
Rh(lll), 
and 
Ru(0001) 
surfaces. 
3. Viny/idenes 
and Meta//acyc/es 
Metal complexes containing unsaturated carbenes 
such as vinylidenes are quite reactive, but can 
nevertheless be isolated. They are usually prepared 
either by conversion of terminal alkynes, or by 
protonation or alkylation of metal acetylides.210 
Many 
mononuclear vinylidene complexes are now known, 
but the metal cluster version is generally more stable, 
Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties 
to the point that conversion of the former to the latter 
can sometimes be driven by just heating the initial 
 omp pound., The M-C-C 
bond angle in mono- 
nuclear compounds is usually linear, even though 
bent configurations 
with angles as acute as 167 
have 
been r e p  r t e d ,    ,     
but in clusters with three or more 
metal atoms the coordination is essentially bridged. 
Bonding in vinylidene complexes is similar to that 
in other carbenes, namely, via a simultaneous a 
donation from the ligand to the metal and back- 
donation from the metal d orbitals to the x
*
 orbital 
of the C-C double bond. The interaction with the n 
system fures the molecular plane of the vinylidene 
moiety at a tilted configuration with respect to the 
metal plane of the complex,235-238 
and creates an 
activation barrier for its rotation of the order of 5 
kcaVmo1.239,240 
On metal surfaces vinylidenes are likely intermedi- 
ates in the decomposition 
of chemisorbed alkenes or 
alkynes. The most convincing 
report of the isolation 
of vinylidene moieties on surfaces is that on Pd- 
(111),204,241 
in which vibrational and X-ray absorption 
data were interpreted as indicative of a di-a bonded 
species with additional x 
interaction to a third metal 
atom. This structure is consistent with that observed 
in organometallic clusters: the vibrational data was 
successfully compared to that of the model com- 
pounds H2Osz(p-C=CHz)(CO)g and Ru2(C2H&(p- 
C=CH2)(C0)3.124,126,138 
In another example, infrared 
data showed that the decomposition of vinyl iodide 
on Pt(ll1) 
yields a mixture of vinylidene and acety- 
lene on the surface around 140 
K.I3l Vinylidene was 
also postulated to be one of a group of compounds 
present on an unreconstructed Pt(100) surface after 
annealing adsorbed ethylene at 300 K, but the data 
analysis in that case was complicated by the overlap 
of vibrational bands from other species in the spec- 
tra.209 
On supported platinum catalysts, NMR mea- 
surements have been interpreted as to reflect the 
conversion of acetylene to vinylidene.242 
Vinylidene 
species may also be stabilized on surfaces by coad- 
sorption with other species: the formation of vi- 
nylidene from both ethylidyne at 350 K on oxygen- 
passivated R u ( O O O  )     
and ethylene decomposition 
on CO-covered Ni( 
have both been suggested 
in the literature. Finally, early claims on the forma- 
tion of vinylidene from ethylene on Pt(111),245,246 
Ni- 
(111),247 
and Fe(100)248 
have been reconsidered. 
Metallacycles containing three to seven atoms are 
also well known in organometallic chemistry,249 
the 
most common being those with either three or four 
carbon atoms. Although these cyclic compounds 
could be regarded as metal complexes with a chelat- 
ing alkyl group occupying two coordination positions, 
their chemistry is usually quite different than that 
of dialkyl compounds. Cyclic compounds can be made 
by a variety of synthetic routes, including the use of 
Grignard type249 
or other bifunctional alkylating 
agents (such as d i h a l i d e  ) ,     
the reduction of allyl 
or four-carbon rings,251,252 
the use of cyclometallation 
 reaction,- and the addition of either cyclopro- 
panes (for the formation of metallayclobutanes) 
or two olefins (for metallacyclopentane). 
The 
rings in most metallacycles have all carbon atoms in 
the same plane, but in many instances that plane 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 
8 2657 
does not include the metal. This often results in 
either puckered258 
or open envelope 
259 type con- 
figurations which, in the case of rings with five or 
more atoms, are usually unstable toward the forma- 
tion of either cyclic organic compounds260 
or olefins.261 
Unsaturated cyclic compounds in which the x 
elec- 
trons are delocalized around the ring are also quite 
common,262,263 
although cis-butadiene ligands may 
also bond via two single bonds and form metallacy- 
lopent-3-enes. 
A number of metallacycles with 
more than one metal atom where alkyl chains one to 
four carbon atoms long act as bridging agents be- 
tween the metal centers have also been character- 
i  e d .     
A recent elegant piece of work has shown how cis- 
3,4-dichlorocyclobutene 
can be used to prepare a C4& 
group on Pd(ll1) 
 surface., Metallacycles have 
also been prepared by thermal decomposition of 
diiodoalkanes on aluminum268 
and, more recently, on 
Ni(100)269 
surfaces. In the latter case, the formation 
of cyclic surface species with three to six carbon 
atoms was inferred from TPD experiments.269 
Many 
other reports claim to have isolated metallacycles on 
surfaces as well, but those experiments have by and 
large been based on the decomposition 
of heterocycles 
such as thiophene, and such systems are so complex 
that the many techniques used to characterize them 
have not yielded definitive proof for the formation of 
the proposed intermediate.O- 
The general belief 
is that when thiophene decomposes on surfaces such 
as Pt(lll), 
Pt(100), Pt(2101, Ni(100), 
Rh(ll1) 
or Ru- 
(OOOl), it loses the sulfur atom and forms a five- 
membered ring with a metal atom. This ring usually 
retains both its aromaticity and its planarity, and is 
tilted with respect to the surface. Bonding to the 
substrate involves 
the first and fourth carbon atoms, 
and has di-a character. The degree of dehydrogena- 
tion of the a-C atoms is not known, but it appears to 
be extensive. It is worth mentioning that this 
thiophene decomposition pathway is not universal: 
on other surfaces the first step has been suggested 
to be the removal of an a 
hydrogen with retention of 
the sulfur atom.275,276 
This latter mechanism has 
some support in the organometallic 1iteratu1-e.

1. Olefins 
Since the preparation in 1827 of Zeises salt, K[(r- 
C2Hd)PtCl&H20, a large number of complexes with 
side-bonded olefins have been isolated for virtually 
all transition metals. Given that this field has 
already been extensively reviewed,278 
only the most 
salient points relevant to the surface systems will be 
mentioned here. Some of the most important syn- 
thetic routes to alkene complexes are (1) direct 
coordination of olefins to unsaturated metal atoms, 
(2) 
ligand substitution, and (3) 
P-hydride elimination 
of alkyl complexes. The structural details of the 
products can be summarized as follows:279 
(1) 
the 
C-C bond distance in the coordinated olefin is 
significantly longer than in the free molecule; (2) 
the 
substituents around the double bond bend away from 
the metal, breaking the original planarity of the 
molecule (that is, the carbon atoms rehybridize); (3) 
2658 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 
the carbon atoms involved in the olefin double bond 
are essentially equidistant from the metal atom; (4) 
the double bond aligns in one of four geometries 
depending on the structure of the overall complex, 
namely, in the plane of trigonal planar compounds, 
perpendicular to the plane of square planar com- 
plexes, in the equatorial plane of trigonal bipyramidal 
configurations, or parallel to one of the axes of 
octahedral compounds. In all cases the bonding is 
sideways and is described by the Dewar-Chatt- 
Duncanson 
model where the filled n molecular orbital 
of the olefin donates electron density to an empty 
valence d orbital of the metal while another filled 
metal d orbital back-donates into the empty n* 
antibonding 
orbital of the double 
According 
to this model, the degree of back-donation determines 
the strength of both the metal-carbon and the 
carbon-carbon bonds, which in fact follow opposite 
trends: one weakens at 
the expense of the other. All 
kinds of complexes can be obtained this way, from 
compounds with a pure n 
interaction, to molecules 
with an essentially metallacyclopropane character. 
In metal clusters olefins usually coordinate in the 
same way as in mononuclear complexes, that is, via 
a n donatiodn back-donation to one of the metal 
atoms, but in those cases the ligand is quite fluxional, 
as it 
can both rotate and twist about its metal-ligand 
axis as well as move to other metal 
In 
addition, multimetal olefin complexes can also bind 
in a di-o configuration to two metal atoms with 
additional II 
interaction to a third metal center.z272z 
Ethylene chemisorption on transition metal sur- 
faces has been studied extensively as 
Two 
types of molecularly adsorbed species have been 
identified, in analogy to the two bonding extremes 
mentioned above: di-o metallacyclic, and n-bonded 
olefinic. The degree of double-bond character re- 
tained upon adsorption varies smoothly from one end 
to the other with the nature of the metal systems; 
by using a criteria based on the relative values of the 
frequencies for the C-C stretching and CHz defor- 
mation vibrational modes,Z85,286 
systems have been 
found for the whole range of rehybridization. The 
reported cases to date go from essentially C-C single- 
bonded species, as on Pt(lll),287

Pd(lll),295 
Pd(l10),296 
Fe(110),297 
and Ni(100).12s As it can be seen from this list, 
ethylene adsorption normally leads to significant 
rehybridization toward a single-bond character, and 
retention of the double-bond character occurs mainly 
in late transition metals, but this trend can be 
modified by coadsorption of species such as oxygen 
or carbon 
It is also interesting to note 
that sometimes 
both types of adsorption are observed 
on the same surface: on Pt(lll), 
for instance, a 
transition from z- 
to di-u-bonded ethylene takes place 
around 50 K302 
and both species presumably coexist 
at saturation coverages around liquid nitrogen tem- 
peratures. 
Much less information is available on the adsorp- 
tion of heavier olefins. Propene, the four isomeric

On

be related to changes in adsorption geometry. It was

standing up in a perpendicular configuration on Cu(ll0).

A spz-to-sp3

puckering of the ring.m Propene chemisorbed on Rh-

Lastly, isobutene 
binds in a tilted triple-coordinated state on Ni(111).306 
There has been a reasonably large amount of work 
carried out on the structural characterization of 
chemisorbed olefins on metal surfaces. Most systems 
are believed to have the C-C double-bond plane 
parallel to the surface regardless of the electronic 
configuration for bonding.220307-312 
There are only 
two known 
exceptions to this rule reported to date. 
The first is ethylene on Ni(100) which, according to 
NEXAFS studies, binds with its C-C bond parallel 
to the surface but with its molecular plane tilted by 
50", 
suggestive of a di-oh three-atom interactin.' 
The second example refers to ethylene on copper 
(Figure 
4), where vibrational studies have shown flat 
adsorption on C  ( l l l ) 2    
and C U (  O O ) ,     
but perpen- 
dicular on Cu(110).293.313 
This last case has been 
recently contested, because results from photoelec- 
tron diffraction experiments suggest that the olefin 
may lie flat even on the Cu(ll0) 
surface,3I4 
but it is 
possible that this discrepancy is due to the recon- 
struction of the Cu(ll0) 
surface under some circum- 
stances. Whatever 
the actual situation 
may be, these 
data suggest that crystallographic orientations play 
an important role in determining adsorption geom- 
etries, perhaps because they control the spatial 
orientation of the d orbitals of the metal. 
Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties 
2. Alkynes, Dienes, and Allyls 
Alkynes bind to metals in a similar manner as 
olefins. However, because of their larger electro- 
negativity, there is more back-donation of metal d 
electrons to the empty X* antibonding orbitals in the 
alkynes, and therefore, the bonding to the metal is 
stronger. In organometallic compounds, two main 
observations support this statement: (1) 
the substit- 
uents in the C-C triple bond tend to fold away from 
the metal by up to 40", and (2) the metal-carbon 
distances shorten by as much as 0.07 A compared to 
the corresponding alkene 
Moreover, 
although alkynes coordinated to one metal-atom 
center are generally regarded as two-electron 
donors, 
the extra x bond allows for a four-electron donation, 
especially in coordinatively unsaturated com- 
plexe.l-l' 
This is even more likely in compounds 
with more than one metal atom, where acetylenic 
compounds tend to coordinate in a bridging config- 
uration. In two-center complexes, for instance, two 
types of geometries have been observed, with the 
C-C bond oriented either paralle1318,319 
or perpen- 
d i c  l a r     
to the metal-metal axis (the latter being 
the most common). In clusters with three or more 
metal atoms, the basic di-o bridging coordination is 
complemented by a x interaction to one or two 
additional atoms. In these latter compounds the 
alkyne can still be considered a four-electron donor, 
even though it is clear that both the metal-alkyne 
interaction and the C-C bond distance increase with 
increasing number of metal atoms, indicating that 
the electron-density 
transfer is larger than in the case 
of one or two metal centers.321-324 
The molecular adsorption of acetylene has been 
characterized for a number of  surface., Based 
mainly on vibrational data, two types of adsorption 
geometries have been proposed: coordination to four 
atoms (for W(110), Fe(lll), Fe(llO), Ru(0001), Ni- 
(lll), 
Ni(100), Pd(100), Cu(lll), 
Cu(lOO), and Cu- 
(110)2021284), 
in a similar way as in Os and Co 
tetrametallic c o m  l e x e s ,    -     
and di-o bridging co- 
ordination to either one or two adjacent metal centers 
with extra n 
interaction to the side atoms (on Ru- 
(OOOl), Rh(lll), 
Ni(llO), Pd(lll), 
Pd(ll0) 
and Pt- 
(111) 
surfaces), like in ( C  H  ) O S  ( C O )   .     
The first 
class is best exemplified by the adsorption of acety- 
lene on Ni(lll), 
for which structural information has 
been obtained by using both LEED and photoelectron 
 p e c t r o s c o p i e s .         
In that case the acetylene mol- 
ecule was found to sit parallel to the surface and in 
a crossed bridge site such that the two carbon atoms 
occupy nonequivalent hollow sites (Fi re 5). The 
C-C distance ranges from 1.44 
to 1.50 r 
(essentially 
a single bond), while the spacing between the mol- 
ecule and the first nickel layer has been reported to 
be either 2.0326 
or 1.4 A.327 
The second coordination 
type is illustrated by the adsorption of acetylene on 
Pt(lll), 
where a LEED structural analysis places the 
molecule lying flat on the surface but coordinated to 
a single metal atom (Figure 5),328 
with metal-carbon 
and carbon-carbon bond distances of 2.5 and 1.3 A 
respectively (in line with what would be expected for 
a carbon-carbon double bond). A more recent NEX- 
AFS determination sets the C-C bond length at 
about 1.45 
A,308 
a value both much different than that

The results from photoelectron 
diffraction experiments on Ni(ll1) 
exemplify one type of 
adsorption where the molecule sits on a bridge site with 
its carbon atoms on %fold hollow sites.312 
The molecular 
axis lies flat 1.36 
A above the surface lane, and the C-C 
bond distance, which is about 1.44 1
,
 
corresponds to a 
single 
bond. Another adsorption configuration 
is illustrated 
by the results from low-energy electron diffraction 
(LEED) 
experiments on Pt(lll), 
where the acetylene sits on top of 
a single platinum atom.328 
The C-C in that case is also 
parallel to the surface plane, but the molecule sits at a 
larger distance from the metal, at about 2.36 A, and the 
C-C bond is much shorter, 
about 1.3 
A.

measured from LEED and outside the range expected 
from what is known in the organometallic literature, 
but this may be explained by the complications in 
the X-ray absorption measurements arising from the 
weak cross section of the shape resonance associated 
with this system.329 
The flat adsorption geometry for 
acetylene on Pt(ll1) has also been confirmed by 
ARUPS data.220 
For acetylene on Pd(lll), on the 
other hand, a combination of UPS and N E W S  
measurements led to the conclusion that the C-C 
axis is tilted by more than 20,330 
with a CCH angle 
of about 117", and a C-C bond length close to 1.3 
A 
(the same as on platinum). Other UPS studies have 
shown that the hybridization of the carbon atoms in 
acetylene changes from essentially sp2 on Ni( 
11 
11, 
Pd(lll), and Pt(lll), 
which corresponds to a C-C 
bond length of the order of 1.35-1.40 A and a HCH 
angle between 120 and 130", 
to close to a sp structure 
on Ni(llO), 
which corresponds to values of about 1.3 
A and 150" for the parameters mentioned above.331 
Conjugated alkenes such as butadiene could be 
considered as four-electron 
donors, since both olefinic 
bonds can coordinate to the central metal atom, but 
the actual bonding is better regarded as the result 
of the interaction of the delocalized x system of the 
diene with the d orbitals of the metal, especially when 
the ligand is in the cis 
c  n f i g u r a t i o n .    ,     
The main 
structural features of inorganic conjugated-alkene 
complexes can be summarized as follows: (1) 
the 
bond between the inner carbon atoms of the diene is 
shorter than the average of the outer ones; (2) 
both 
inner and outer carbon atom pairs are each equidis- 
tant from the metal; (3) 
the inner carbons are closer 
to the metal center; (4) 
the four carbons are coplanar, 
with C-C-C bond angles ranging from 114 to 121"; 
and (5) 
the substituents in the C
1
 and C4 positions 
tend to be twisted out of the four-carbon plane. All 
of these observations can be rationalized by a struc-

ture somewhere 
between a bent di-a 
cis-metallacyclo- 
3-pentene with some additional n 
interaction and a 
c i s -   - d i e n e .     
Binding of butadiene in the trans 
configuration is rare, but it has been observed in a 
few circumstances, both in mononuclear com- 
p l e  e s    ,     
and in clusters.336 
Bonding in those cases 
is likely to be via a n 
interaction, and their conversion 
to the cis configuration is facile. 
Only a few studies have dealt with the determina- 
tion of the structural details of butadiene adsorbed 
on metal surfaces. Vibrational data for butadiene on 
Pt(ll1) 
was interpreted in terms of a 1,2-di-o 
species, 
which supposedly forms at 170 K and converts into 
a tetra-a coordinated moiety by 300 K.228 This 
hypothesis is supported by some theoretical calcula- 
tions done for Pt(110).337 
On Mo(100), on the other 
hand, both N E W S  
and ARUPS data suggest that 
the molecular orbitals are only minimally perturbed 
upon adsorption at low temperatures, and that the 
butadiene plane is oriented at about 40" from the 
surface plane; heating of this layer to 200 K induces 
a transformation to a moiety with an electronic 
configuration similar to that of gas-phase trans-2- 
butene.338 Finally, the adsorption of 1,3-cyclohexa- 
diene on Pt(ll1) is accompanied by a significant 
rehybridization of the carbon atoms involved. The 
adsorbate-surface interaction in that case seems to 
be better described by assuming two separate di-o 
coordinations rather than one overall n 
bond to the 
surface. 
339 
Allyl ligands usually bind to a metal center in 
either q3 
or a n 
coordination modes; in both cases the 
neutral allyl ligand acts as a three-electron do- 
nor.174,279 
Discrete compounds with allyl ligands are 
quite easy to make: they can be prepared by treating 
metal complexes with Grignard, allyl halide, or allyl 
alcohol reagents, by hydride abstraction from coor- 
dinated alkenes, or by protonation of 1,3-diene 
Structural studies have indicated that, 
as long as there is no clear asymmetry imposed on 
the molecule by other ligands, the allyl group itself 
is quite symmetric: both C-C bonds are about the 
same length, the C-C-C 
bond angle has a value 
around 120" (typical of a sp2 
hybridization), and the 
metal atom is located approximately at the centroid 
of the allylic triangle. In substituted allylic ligands 
the substituents are in general bent away from the 
C3 plane, most commonly toward the meta1.315-317 
In 
cyclic ligands such as cyclopentadienyls, 
however, the 
part of the ring that does not contribute to the allylic 
interaction usually bends away from the 
Allyl ligands are also well known to bridge two metal 
atoms, but the details of the geometrical arrangement 
in these cases depend on the overall structure of the 
c o m p  u n d .    ,     
The best examples for well-characterized allylic 
species on metal surfaces are those on Ag(llO), 
where 
allyl chloride decomposes to form an allylic moiety 
around 180 K,345 
and where isobutene reacts with 
oxygen to produce a small amount of a n-2-methyl 
allyl species.346 
The vibrational data from the first 
study was interpreted as being the result of a r3-n 
coordination with the molecular plane parallel to the 
surface. On Al(lOO), the decomposition of 3-bromo- 
1-propene around 310 K yields the same allylic 
Zaera 
species.268 
An intermediate allylic species has also 
been observed during the dehydrogenation of both 
cyclohexane and cyclohexene on Pt(

3. Arenes 
Many aromatic ligands, cyclopentadienyl ions and 
benzene rings in particular, n 
bond quite easily to 
metal complexes.320 Arene metal compounds are 
readily prepared by reacting metal complexes directly 
with the aromatic molecule, a procedure that can lead 
to the displacement of three terminal carbonyls or 
other more labile ligands.349 In metal clusters, the 
benzene ring usually coordinates in a similar geom- 
etry to that of the mononuclear complexes,350 
but 
there are some multicenter metallic compounds 
where the aromatic ligands coordinate in either a 
bridge, on-edge position within a metal triangle,351-354 
or by capping a triangular f a  e .    -     
Alternative 
(and perhaps more interesting) synthetic routes for 
arene complexes start from either dienes359 
or 
alkynes;llg we will discuss the dimerization and 
trimerization reactions involved in those processes 
in a subsequent section. 
Arenes (benzene complexes) 
usually bind to transi- 
tion metals in a r6 
six-electron n-donating configu- 
ration which depletes most of the n 
electron cloud of 
the molecule and therefore reduces its aromaticity. 
The benzene ring usually retains its planar config- 
uration, but occasionally this charge donation causes 
Kekul6 bond distortions where either the C-C bond 
distances become  n e q u a l   l -     
or the ring bends into 
boat360 
or 
geometries, and where any 
groups directly attached to the benzene ring bend 
away from their normal planar position.279 
A few 
cases have been reported where the aromatic ligand 
coordinates in either q4 361,362 or r2 
3633364 
configura- 
tions; in the former case the bonding resembles that 
of any other cis-diene. 
It is generally accepted that benzene adsorption on 
metal surfaces at low temperatures is molecular, 
that 
the aromatic ring usually orients itself flat on the 
surface, and that the adsorption process can induce 
noticeable changes in the shape of the ring.365

 expected for top-site coordination on (111) 
surfaces of fcc metals, suggesting that it may involve 
more than one metal atom (either a bridge or a hollow 
site). Structural LEED studies on Rh(ll1) and 
Pt(ll1) surfaces have not only corroborated that 
conclusion, but have also shown that not all the C-C 
bonds within the molecule have the same length 
(Figure 
6). Alternating values were seen in the case 
of Rh,382,383 
and two opposite shorter bonds were 
observed on Pt (a bridge configuration).384 
There is 
some controversy about the length of the C-C bonds 
in these systems: the LEED studies yielded average 
values ranging from 1.52 to 1.72 A (the latter being 
significantly longer than a single bond), but more 
recent N E W S  studies on Pt(ll1) resulted in a 
value of 1.40 A.367,376

examples have been reported in the literature for the 
conversion of saturated molecules to other com- 
pounds, both in organometallic complexes and on 
solid surfaces. The initial chemical interaction of an 
alkane with a metal center has been proposed to 
involve a three-center two-electron bond between a 
filled C-H bonding orbital and an unfilled metal d 
orbital. Theoretical calculations indicate that dl0- 
ML3 and d'O-MLz systems should be particularly 
effective in activating alkanes and that such a 
reaction may take place by first forming an 
interme- 
diate with a M-H-C 
angle larger than 130".404 This 
idea is supported by the large number of stable 
complexes displaying this type of intramolecular 
interaction (the so-called agostic bonding) that have 
been i s  l a t e d . '   .     
Kinetic studies on intramolecular activation reac- 
tions also suggest the formation of a reactive $(C- 
H) alkane intermediate.47.408 
Although such an 
alkane complex has not yet been isolated, evidence 
is accumulating for its formation during reductive 
elimination reactions (C-H bond-forming steps) 
and, 
as required by the principle of microscopic revers- 
ibility, during alkane oxidative 
additions (C-H bond- 
breaking steps). For instance, recent isotope-labeling 
studies have shown that the reductive elimination 
of methane from methyl tungsten hydride complexes 
is intramolecular and that hydrogen scrambling 
between the methyl and the hydride ligands is faster 
than methane elimination. This suggests that such 
scrambling requires the formation of a weakly held 
methane-tungsten c0mplex.4 
Also, intermolecular 
reactions between organometallic intermediates 
and saturated hydrocarbons are usually favored 
over activation of C-H bonds within coordinated 
l i g a n d  . 4   -  '   
A feature common to all these reactions 
seems to be the generation of a low-coordination, 
highly reactive complex with high electron density 
at 
the central metal. Such an unstable intermediate 
can in fact be photolytically generated in situ in an 
alkane solvent.41 Oxidative addition of alkanes has 
also been induced on bare metal atoms, either by 
radiating the metal in an alkane matrix,413.414 
or by 
gas-phase generation 
of metal-alkane cIsters.4'. 
Evidence is also available for the complexation of 
alkanes on surfaces. Any molecule can, of course, be 
condensed at 
low enough 
substrate 
temperatures, but 
the fact that many metal-based catalysts are good 
promoters for alkane H-D exchange and hydro- 
genolysis reactions is a clear indication that the 
alkane-metal interaction is stronger than a purely 
van der Waals attraction. Alkane activation has also 
been reported on single-crystal surfaces under 
vacuum, in some cases via the formation of a weakly 
bonded alkane-metal intermediate. On Ni(100) 
surfaces, for instance, molecular beam experiments 
have shown that while the angular distribution of the 
scattered methane has the specular shape typical of 
direct inelastic scattering, butane displays a cosine 
dependence indicative of complete energy exchange 
with the surface, and both ethane and propane 
exhibit a behavior intermediate between those two 
extremes."? 
More recent studies have extended 
these conclusions 
to other surfaces, and have helped 
in the estimation of some adsorption energies. It was

symmetry has 
been reported on Ni(l10),372 
but, in contrast with the 
LEED results, ARUPS studies of benzene on 
and Pd(110)395 
single crystals have all yielded the 
pseudo-C6, symmetry suggestive of on-top coordina- 
tion on a single metal atom; the discrepancy between 
the ARUPS and LEED results is still unresolved. In 
high-symmetry cases, however, there could still be 
some rehybridization on the carbon atoms and some 
bending of the C-H bonds upward from the molec- 
ular plane.374 Lastly, a combination of NEXAFS, 
UPS, and XPS studies 
have led to the conclusion that 
at low temperatures and high coverages benzene 
adopts a tilted configuration on both P d ( l I P 6  
and 
Pd(110),395 
with the molecular plane inclined between 
10" and 30" with respect to the metal surface. 
Much less is known about the coordination of other 
aromatic compounds to metal surfaces.37739z397-399 
On 
the basis of vibrational data it was concluded that 
toluene adsorbs molecularly on Pt(ll1) 
with the ring 
parallel to the surfae,3 
but a NEXAFS study 
suggested that the ring is tilted instead, at least at 
300 K.377 These two claims could be reconciled if it 
is assumed that the high-temperature species is in 
fact a u-bonded benzyl moiety; indirect evidence for

 Others 
Although 
no metal-alkane inorganic adducts have 
hitherto been isolated, there is ample evidence for 
the intramolecular interaction of C-H bonds with 
metallic centers 
in complexes with saturated ligands. 
Early studies on a number of compounds 
containing 
polypyrazolyl ligands resulted in the observation of 
both unusual NMR chemical shifts and low C-H 
stretching freqencies.4 
Further proof of the inter- 
action of aliphatic hydrogens with metal centers came 
from the observation of short M-HC distances in 
neutron-diffraction structural s t  d i e s , 4    
and clear 
evidence for the existence of agostic interactions in 
metal compounds with a l k  l i d e n e     
and 
ligands was presented soon after. Agostic interac- 
tions have since been observed in a large number of 
compounds and are now well acepted.4"," 
Metal 
clusters with agostic interactions have been isolated 
as well; one particularly interesting example of this 
relates to the interconversion of methyl to methylene 
reported in a triosmium c l u  t e r . 4    
ks in the case of alkanes, the structural and 
spectroscopic data for agostic systems reported thus 
far are consistent 
with the description of the metal- 
HC system in terms of a three-center, two-electron 
bond. Ab initio calculations have provided a theo- 
retical framework to support this hypothesi.4," 
The minimum requirement for agostic interactions 
is for the metal center to have an empty orbital to 
receive the two electrons of the C-H bond. It is 
presumed that this orbital has essentially d character 
and that its energy and disposition approach those 
of the C-H bonding orbital. Moreover, the metal 
atom could not have reached its maximum coordina- 
tion number; on the basis of steric considerations it 
is expected that the formation of agostic bonds is 
favored in metals having coordination numbers of six 
or less. Calculations for the agostic interaction 
between the /
3
 C-H and the metal in ethyl ligands 
indicate that the coordination geometry is optimized 
when the M-C,-Co 
angle is on the order of go", 
the 
M-H distance is short (around 
2.23 8
,
 
for Ti and 2.13 
8, for Pd), and the C HB 
distance is large (1.11- 
1.13 A, about 0.05 llonger than the other C-H 
bonds within the same ligand). Agostic distortions 
have in fact been seen experimentally in coordinated 
methyl groups. In one example, the Ta-C,-H, 
angle 
was measured to be close to 
In spite of the 
relatively strong nature of the agostic interaction, 
which has a binding energy of the order of 10 kcaY 
mo1,406 agostic hydrogens are easily displaced by 
other donor groups if there are no steric constraints. 
The existence of agostic interactions on surfaces 
has again been suggested by computer calcula- 
t i o n   .     
and supported by the appearance of soft 
modes in the C-H stretching 
region of the vibrational 
spectra. For methyl groups on Ni(11Ug4 and 
Pt(111)49,442,443 
surfaces, broad bands have been re- 
ported around 2600-2700 cm-'. On the other hand, 
a series of theoretical calculations for the CH$ 
Ni(ll1) system has suggested that there is little

(HREELS) for cyclohexane adsorbed on Pt(ll1) 
at low 
temperatures."' The broad and intense "sofbmode" seen 
around 2500 cm-' io this spectrum was initially assigned 
to an agostic interaction between some of the C-H bonds 
of the molecule and the surface atoms, but has later been 
reinterpreted as the result of a mild repulsive interaction 
between the metal and each of the three C-H bonds 
oriented directly toward the surface (the molecule is 
believed to maintain its chair configuration). 
found that the heat of molecular adsorption starts 
around 4-5 kcaYmol for methane, and increases at 
the rate of an additional 1-2 kcaYmol per methylene 
group in heavier 
Because this trend 
parallels that of the heats of vaporization of alkanes, 
it is reasonable to assume that the alkane chains 
adsorbs approximately flat on the surface. Infrared 
data support this conlusion.4 
Temperature-programmed 
desorption experiments 
have confirmed the molecular beam results men- 
tioned above. They have also shown that the prob- 
ability for alkane decomposition (relative to its 
desorption) increases with increasing molecular 
The extent of this decomposition de- 
pends on the structure of the surface: open, "cor- 
rugated" surfaces can be several orders of magnitude 
more reactive than flat, "smooth" ones.418 Further 
evidence of a chemical interaction between the mol- 
ecule and the metal atoms comes from the develop- 
ment of a new, intense and broad band in the C-H 
stretching 
region of the vibrational spectra for cyclic 
alkanes (Figure 7). These new "soft" modes, which 
have frequency values as low as 2600 cm-' (more 
than 200 em-' below those of the gas-phase mol- 
ecule), have been observed for cyclohexane on 
pt(100),427 
Cu(lll),4z8 
and Cu(100).429 
It was initially 
suggested that these modes were due to an attractive 
interaction between the C-H bond and the metal, 
but more recently they have been explained in terms 
of a geometrical match between the axial C-H bonds 
and the surface lattice.430 
It is now believed that the 
cyclohexane molecules adsorb in their chair config- 
uration, with three of the axial hydrogens directed 
straight down to the surface and that the interaction 
between each C-H bond and the surface is in fact 
mildly repulsive. Similar soft modes have also been

C-H vibrational mode softening has been observed 
for longer alkyl chains on Cu(ll1) 
surfaces as well, 
but since the strong metal-HC interaction seems to 
also involve the a carbon in that case, it could again 
be argued that it results from a charge donation 
between the metal and the adsorbate, and not from 
an agostic interation.

step.407,408 
In most cases the scission of saturated 
C-H bonds requires complexes with labile ligands, 
so they can be easily released to produce the electron- 
deficient electrophilic 
metal centers needed for three- 
center two-electron agostic interactions.323 
Alkane activation can also be induced on solid 
metal surfaces. Most alkanes physisorb on metal 
surfaces at low temperatures, but they usually desorb 
molecularly upon heating of the sample;419,420 
as 
mentioned above, alkane chemisorption requires the 
breaking of at least one C-H bond. One indication 
of the ability of metal surfaces in activating saturated 
C-H bonds is the fact that they are good catalysts 
for H-D exchange, dehydrogenation, isomerization, 
and hydrogenolysis 
of 
Vacuum studies 
on the adsorption and activation of alkanes on metal 
surfaces, by molecular beams as well as by more 
conventional 
adsorption-desorption techniques, have 
raised several issues related to the nature of the 
activation step. For one, the C-H bond scission may 
occur directly upon collision of the incoming gas 
molecule with the surface, or, alternatively, it may 
involve the formation of a weakly adsorbed interme- 
diate trapped on the surface. Many molecular beam 
studies have provided evidence for the first mecha- 
nism and have shown that the critical factor in 
determining the efficiency 
of the activation is the rate 
of energy transfer from the translational and internal 
degrees of freedom of the molecule to a particular 
C-H bond; the energy stored by the surface seems 
to be of little importance for this process.77,417,P56,457 
An early study by Stewart and Ehrlich revealed that 
vibrational modes are the most likely source of energy 
for the dissociation of methane on rhodium (which 
provide about 7 kcal/m01), 
and Rettner et al. found 
that only the normal component of the translational 
energy of methane is important for the C-H bond 
breaking on W(l10).456 
This latter conclusion has 
been later extended to the activation of both 
methane459-462 
and other  alkane,,, on a 
variety of metal surfaces (Figure 8). 
It has been suggested that direct alkane activation 
occurs via a tunneling mechanism.461,465-467 
For one, 
the sticking probability of the alkane often increases 
monotonically with increasing kinetic energy, it does 
not display the threshold expected for cases where 
the kinetics are dominated by an activation barrier 
(Figure 
In addition, the observed shifts in the 
translational energy needed to activate CH4 vs CD4, 
or C2H6 vs C2D6, are usually on the order of 5 kcaV 
mol, much larger than the differences in their zero- 
point energies.468 Kinetic arguments, on the other 
hand, have been used to propose that the energy and 
angle dependence of the sticking coefficient of meth- 
ane observed experimentally may be related to the 
strongly peaked desorption profile of methane de- 
sorption from reductive elimination of methyl with 
hydrogen (the reverse of the oxidative addition of 
methane) i n  t e a d .    ,     
In any case, most of these 
IV. Reactivity 
A. C-H Bond Activation 
1. Alkanes 
Developing methods to convert alkanes into other 
more useful compounds has proven to be a great 
challenge. Any reaction that involves alkanes must 
start with the scission of one of its C-H bonds, a 
process that requires energies of about 100 
kcaVmo1. 
It was reported some time ago that saturated hydro- 
carbons could be activated by soluble platinum salts 
at relatively high  temperature,,' but since no 
hydrido-alkyl metal complexes 
were detected in any 
of those studies, the reaction was proposed to require 
the formation of free radicals. The first reported 
example of an intermolecular addition of an alkane 
C-H bond into a metal compound was that induced 
by an intermediate produced via the photolytic 
activation of (Me&p)Ir(PMe3)(H)2.410 
This reaction 
yields a hydrido-metal complex with the increase in 
coordination number and nominal oxidation state of 
the metal center expected in oxidative addition 
reactions. A few more reports have appeared in the 
literature for this type of C-H bond a d d i t i  n ,    ,     
but such a reaction is still regarded as difficult. 
The mechanism by which organometallic com- 
plexes activate alkanes is still far from understood. 
For instance, it is not entirely clear why C-H bonds 
do not add as readily as hydrogen molecules. It is 
currently believed that the main reason for this 
difference is that M-C bonds are in general weaker 
than M-H bonds.449,450 
Indeed, oxidative addition is 
favored in systems where the resulting M-C bond 
is strong.451 
The activation of arenes by (Me5Cp)Ir- 
(PMe3)(H)2, 
for example, is about four times faster 
than the activation of cyclohexane with the same 
complex,410 
and primary carbon atoms in aliphatic 
alkanes are about three times more reactive than 
those in secondary positions (in spite of their higher 
bond energy), in this latter case perhaps because of 
the difference in steric hindrance. 
Much research points to the idea that alkane 
activation by organometallic compounds requires the 
formation of a weak intermediate complex. Although 
direct evidence for the formation of alkane-metal 
adducts is not yet available, the initial metal-HC 
interaction is believed to be agostic. For one, there 
are a large number of examples of stable complexes 
containing intramolecular agostic interactions.405 
In 
particular, the characterization of catalytic cyclic 
dehydrogenation reactions with Ir(H)z(P(p-PhF)&- 
(OOCCF3) 
has led to the isolation of an agostic alkyl

These data, obtained by using supersonic mo- 
lecular beams, displays the exponential dependence of the 
sticking coefficient on the perpendicular component of the 
translational energy of the impinging methane molecules 
that argues for a direct tunneling mechanism for methane 
activation at high energies. Other evidence, however, 
suggests the possibility of a second, precursor-mediated, 
pathway at lower energies where the actual C-H 
bond 
scission is preceded by an agostic interaction between one 
of the C-H 
bonds of a weakly adsorbed methane and a 
metal atom. 
experiments used supersonic beams with narrow 
distributions of high energies, and given that only a 
small fraction of the gas molecules in a typical 
catalytic mixture (those at the high energy tail of the 
Boltzmann distribution) have such energies, the 
probability of any collision-induced alkane activation 
process would be expected to be low. This has been 
confirmed by high-pressure experiments, which have 
yielded values for the sticking probability of methane 
Other molecular beam work has provided evidence 
for a precursor-mediated alkane activation mecha- 
nism. The trapping probability of ethane on Ir(ll0)- 
(1x2), for instance, shows only a weak dependence 
on the angle of incidence of the beam, suggesting that 
the momentum of the incoming molecules is rapidly 
transferred to the surface.464 
In some cases alkane 
dissociation is also assisted by an energy transfer 
from the surface: on both platinum and rhodium, for 
example, 
the sticking probability of methane depends 
on the temperature of the surface in an Arrhenius 
manner when the kinetic energy of the gas molecules 
is low, and displays an activation energy of between 
5 and 10 
k  a l / m o l .   l ,     
Lastly, physisorbed methane 
can be activated by collisions with other impinging 
molecules (a 
"hammering" effect),477 
and some chemi- 
sorbed heavier alkanes can be activated directly by 
heating of the s  b s t r a t e .  '  -     
Trapping-mediated surface reactions most likely 
proceed via a three-center two-electron intermediate 
similar to that proposed in organometallic sys- 
t e m  .   ,   ,    ,    ,     
The activation barrier associated 
with the decomposition 
of alkanes on metal surfaces 
is in most cases lower than 20 kcal/mo1,471-474,484 
less 
than one-fifth of the C-H bond energy in hydrocar- 
as low as 10-10-10-12 471-475 
bon molecules. This suggests that an initial elec- 
tronic interaction between the alkane and the surface 
weakens these C-H bonds prior to reaction. In 
addition, chemical trends similar to those reported 
for organometallic systems have also been observed 
on surfaces. First, alkane activation is facilitated by 
electron deficiency at the metal center. There is a 
clear correlation between the position of the metal 
in the periodic table and its reactivity: early transi- 
tion metals are particularly efficient in dissociating 
medium-size alkane chains,422 
and iridium dissociates 
both methane and ethane more efficiently than 
platinum.418 Second, 
there is a structure sensitivity 
associated with this reaction: for any given metal, 
rough surfaces are in general more active than close- 
packed ones.418,421 
Lastly, the coadsorption of addi- 
tives such as alkali metals or chalcogens can activate 
nominally inert substrates for alkane decomposi- 
t i  n .     
On the other hand, an isotope labeling study 
of alkane decomposition on Pt(llO)-(l 
x2) indicated 
that secondary and tertiary carbon atoms within 
aliphatic hydrocarbons react faster than primary 
 carbon,, an order opposite to that in organome- 
tallic complexes but in accord with the differences 
in bond energy. 
The oxidative addition of alkanes into metal sur- 
faces most likely leads to the formation of chemi- 
sorbed alkyl groups. Thus far this has been corrobo- 
rated only in one instance, for the case of methane 
on Ni(lll), 
where vibrational spectroscopy 
was used 
to identify the resulting methyl groups.488 
2. Alkyls 
By far the most common decomposition pathway 
in complexes with alkyl ligands is the loss of a 
hydrogen atom from the second carbon from the 
metal center (the /3 p o s i t i  n ) .    -   l  
This so-called 
P-hydride elimination reaction is believed to take 
place in a concerted step, via a planar four-center 
transition state which decomposes to form an (r2- 
alkene)metal-hydride complex. Normally this com- 
plex then releases a free alkene,492,493 
but in some 
cases the coordinated olefin intermediate can be 
i s  l a t e d .    ,     
/3-Hydride 
elimination reactions are usually revers- 
ible,23,496 
and in many cases part of isomerization497 
and WD s  r a m b l i n g 4        
processes. In cases where 
hydrogen scrambling is not a problem, isotopic label- 
ing experiments have successfully proven that hy- 
drogen abstraction is usually highly selective at the 
p position, and that the reaction displays a normal 
kinetic isotope effect.500 In dialkyl complexes the 
decomposition products normally consist of a 1:l 
alkane/alkene mixture, which is produced by a P-hy- 
dride elimination step followed by the reductive 
elimination of the second alkyl ligand.493,501 
Several aspects of the mechanism for the P-H 
elimination have already been elucidated. First, the 
leaving hydrogen atom has a negative ion character. 
This has been shown by studies on the effect that 
changing the substituent groups on the /
3
 carbon has 
on the r e a c t i  n :    ,     
electron-withdrawing substit- 
uents suppress the reaction, while electron-donating 
groups enhance its rate. Second, the large negative 
entropy changes associated with the transition state

are consistent with a cyclic intermediate!04 
And 
third, the stereochemistry for the reaction is also 
consistent with a syn elimination from that interme- 
diate.505 
One of the key features of the mechanism for 
j3-hydride elimination is that it leads to an increase 
in the coordination number of the metal center. The 
reaction is therefore inoperative in coordinatively 
saturated compounds: any 18-electron complex has 
to lose at least one ligand in order to open a site for 
the elimination p r o d   t s . 4           -     
In 16-electron 
complexes, on the other hand, an additional coordi- 
nation site is usually available, except in Pd(I1) and 
WII) 
compounds, which tend to avoid the 18-electron 
c0diguration.4 
8-Hydride elimination may also be 
hindered by steric effects when the alkyl groups are 
either too bulky,Sog 
or have a rigid structure not 
capable of arranging into the planar configuration 
required for the transition state!I0 
Cyclopentyl 
groups, for instance, dehydrogenate at a rate several 
orders of magnitude faster than cyclohexyl 
 ligand.', The activation energy for the &hydride 
elimination reaction ranges from 5490 
to 30 kcaV 
mol,50g 
depending on the magnitude of these elec- 
tronic and steric effects. Its selectivity may also be 
affected by these parameters, and the preferential 
formation of 1-alkenes 
(the most common product), 
trans-2-alkenes (in some Cr compounds513), 
or even 
the less stable cis isomers (in 
bulky clusters514) 
may 
all be observed depending on the specific case. 
,%Hydride elimination is also the most favorable 
alkyl decomposition reaction on surfaces. One of the 
best early examples of this was provided by temper- 
ature-programmed desorption studies on the decom- 
position of partially labeled ethyl iodides on Pt(ll1). 
It was shown that the thermal activation of ethyl 
groups on that surface leads to the exclusive release 
of a deuterium atom in the case of CDsCHzI, but of 
normal hydrogen from CH3CDzI in.tead.J*

for 8- 
over either a-

clearly demonstrated on both Cu(llO)M

additional studies highlighted the ease with which

The details of the mechanism for 8-H

 The selective desorption of CH3- 
CD=CHz from the 2,2-dideuteriopropyl 
group that forms 
in this case indicates that P-hydride elimination reactions 
are highly preferred over a-

1-hexene from 2-iodohexane on CU(OO)? 
The fact 
that on Cu(100) 8-H elimination is much faster in 
3-hexyl groups than in cyclohexyl moieties indicates 
that molecular strain also hinders the reaction, and 
suggests a cyclic transition state?24 Finally, a mo- 
lecular cluster calculation for the decomposition of

a four-center planar intermediate?12

This difference is paralleled by 
differences in the thermodynamics of the reaction, 
and therefore may be related to the affinity of the 
different surfaces for atomic hydrogen. Also, the 
elimination of a deuterium atom from an ethyl group 
is about 10 times slower than the elimination of a 
normal hydrogen on either C  ( 1 0 0 )     
or Fe(lOO)lOz 
surfaces; 
since normal primary isotope effects can at 
the most account for a factor of 5, 
the remaining 
difference must be due either to tunneling or to 
secondary effects. The reaction rate can be reduced 
further by caging effects, because a large ensemble 
of atoms is required to accommodate the resulting 
products;525 
this may be related to the increase in 
coordination number required for the reaction in 
organometallic systems. Some other signilicant 
trends 
have been observed (1) 
The desorption temperature 
of alkenes from alkyl groups on Ni(100) shifts to 
higher temperature with increasing chain length, 
perhaps because of the increase in adsorption energy 
of the pr0ducts.4 
(2) 
Branched alkyls yield more 
alkenes than linear ones (relative to the alkane 
produced by the competing reductive elimination 
reaction), and they do so at 
lower temperatures. This 
effect can be explained at least in part by steric and 
entropic arguments. (3) 
Open surfaces are normally 
2888 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No.

more active than close-packed ones: the formation 
of ethylene from ethyl peaks around 240 K in tem- 
perature-programmed desorption on Cu(lOO), but 
only about 225 Kon Cu(110).526 
This difference may 
be correlated to the requirement of low-coordination 
numbers for the j3-H elimination in organometallic 
complexes. (4) j3-H elimination is easier on earlier 
transition metals: it occurs below 200 K on nickel, 
palladium, or platinum surfaces, at 
around 230-250 
K on copper, and at about 260-310 K on gold. (5) 
Most metals are efficient at promoting j3-hydride 
elimination reactions, but a few late transition metals 
tend to favor the reductive elimination route instead. 
On silver in particular alkyl groups couple with 100% 
efficiency,@ 
perhaps because the low affinity of silver 
for hydrogen inhibits any hydride elimination steps; 
the same lack of elimination activity has been 
reported in silver complees.5 
Hydride elimination from the a position, i.e., from 
the carbon bonded to the metal, is generally much 
less favorable than from the j3 carbon, but it is 
operative in ligands with no j3 hydrogens such as 
methyl, neopentyl, and b e n  y l .   -     
The simplest 
case of an a-H elimination step is the conversion of 
methyl to methylene 
groups. In contrast to the olefin 
produced in j3-elimination reactions, though, the 
methylene moiety that results from a-H 
abstraction 
is not stable in free form, and therefore remains 
coordinated to the metal. Moreover, methylene- 
hydride complexes are 
usually unstable and therefore 
difficult to isolate. In spite of the lack of direct 
evidence for the mechanism for this reaction, some 
kinetic data suggest that a-elimination is facile in 
early transition metal complexes, even in some 
coordinated alkyl moieties with j3-hdrogens.5'3.58.529 
A few coordinatively unsaturated methyl complexes 
can also exist in equilibrium with their corresponding 
methylene hydride isomer, a process that promotes 
fast H-D exchange 
at 
the a 
poition.4'. 
The same 
methyl-methylene equilibrium can also be attained 
in clsters,5' 
but in dialkyl organometallic com- 
pounds the formation of carbene ligands is usually 
accompanied by the subsequent elimination of an 
alkane molecule in a disproportionation reaction 
which may take place either through the formation 
of a metal hydride intermediate 
or directly via a four- 
center activated complex (where the a-abstraction 
step is bypassed)?32 Intermolecular a-hydride ab- 
straction reactions are possible as we11.533.534 
On surfaces, alkyl a-hydride elimination reactions 
have so far only been observed in methyl groups. The 
conversion of methyl moieties to methylene groups 
was clearly established on Pt(ll1) 
by reflection- 
absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS).52535 
In- 
direct evidence for such a reaction in other cases 
comes from temperature-programmed desorp- 
tion36*a,47,62 
and photoelectron spectrocopf3 
experi- 
ments. The multiple H-D exchange seen for methyl 
groups on Pt(ll1) 
suggests an activation barrier of 
less than 10 
kcdmol for the dehydrogenation 
of those 
moietie.I'* 
A fast alkyl-alkylidene equilibrium 
may also be one of the key steps in the mechanism 
of H-D exchange reactions in alkanes on transition

This is perhaps the best surface science example for C-C 
bond-scission reactions. The mechanism of this reaction is 
still not well understood, but the fact that only normal 
isobutene is formed even when starting with 1,l-dideute- 
rioneopentyl iodide indicates that the bond that breaks is 
that between the a and B carbons. It is also quite likely 
that at least one dehydrogenation step precedes this C-C 
cleavage, since a normal kinetic isotope effect 
is seen for 
the overall reaction (the peak shifls by about 30 K to 
higher 
temperatures in the a-deuterated neopentyl case) 
Elimination at positions further along the carbon 
chain, whenever possible, usually yields cyclic prod- 
u c t  . '    
The selectivity for y- versus a-hydride e l i -  
nation in inorganic 
compounds depends 
on the nature 
of the metal complex. For example, neopentyl tan- 
talum compounds tend to form stable methylenic 
species via an a-hydride elimination step,17' but 
analogous platinum complexes undergo elimination 
at the y position to yield metallacyclobutane com- 
pounds instead?38 It has been suggested that y 
eliminations are favored by low-valence late transi- 
tion metals. 
No direct evidence is yet available for y-elimination 
reactions on surfaces. A recent study has identified 
the production of isobutene from decomposition of 
neopentyl moieties on Ni(100),539 
which additional 
isotope labeling experiments showed occurs by dis- 
sociation of the c-C bond closer to the surface 
(Figure 
Since the C-C bond cleavage 
presumably occurs after a number of a-H elimina- 
tions, this result suggests that a hydrogens are 
substantially more reactive than y hydrogens. 
3. Vinyls, Acefylides, and 
AMs 
Mononuclear 
transition metal vinyl complexes are 
rare, but a few vinyl containing clusters, which 
represent solid surfaces more closely, have been 
prepared. Coordinated vinyl groups dehydrogenate 
by either a- 
or j3-hydride elimination steps to yield 
 i n y l i d e n e   -     
or acetlene,S 
respectively. Un- 
fortunately, little is known 
about the factors that 
control the selectivity between those two reaction 
pathways. On surfaces the mechanism for vinyl 
dehydrogenation seems to depend on the nature of 
the transition metal: infrared experiments indicated 
that the thermal activation of vinyl moieties on 
Chemistry of Hydrocatboon Moieties 
Pt(ll1) 
leads to the formation of a mixture of vi- 
nylidene and acetylene around 140 K,131 while a 
preference for pure acetylene formation at much 
higher temperatures, about 275 K, was seen on 
Ni(100).128 
Much less is known about the dehydrogenation of 
either acetylides or aryl moieties, in part because 
they tend to decompose via alternative paths such 
as 
protonation or alkylation at 
the a 
or j
3
 carbons (to 
form either acetylene, vinyl, or arene ligands), or 
rearrangement to vinylidene complees." 
An in- 
tramolecular ortho hydride abstraction from the 
phenyl ligand of a tantalum compound yields the 
corresponding y2-benzyne cmplex," 
suggesting a 
chemistry similar to that of vinyl moieties. Little is 
understood about these reactions on surfaces too. 
Acetylides usually dehydrogenate completely to hy- 
drogen and surface carbon, but it is not yet clear how 
this reaction proceeds; in many cases the final nature 
of the remaining surface carbon is not even 
known.139J41-144J47 
Benzyne formation from benzene 
decomposition has been reported on OS(OOO) 
and 
on M O (   O ) ?    
but the mechanism for the dehydro- 
genation of chemisorbed aryl moieties is still a 
mystery. 
4. Ca&enes, and Ca&ynes 
Carbene ligands are very reactive, especially in 
monometallic complexes. Thermal decomposition of 
Fischer-type carbene complexes usually leads to the 
formation of either one or both of two possible types 
of alkenes, namely, those formed by ligand dimer- 
iation: 
andlor those produced by a 1,2 shift

schmck-type 
carbenes 
(which 
include most alkylidenes), on the other hand, nor- 
mally react via an a-hydride 
elimination step to yield 
the coordinated carbyne (alkylidyne), either sponta- 
neously, via an intramolecular 
reductive-elimination 
step,550,551 
or after induction by an external b a  e . 5    
The intramolecular a-hydride abstraction is believed 
to occur in one concerted step, starting from a 
structure with an agostic interaetion between the 
metal and at least one of the a C-H b0nds.3 
Neutron scattering studies have indicated that in 
tantalum-alkylidene complexes the precursor to this 
hydride elimination already has a highly distorted 
sp2-hybridized a carbon, a Ta-C distance shorter 
than that of a typical double bond, a Ta-H distance 
only slightly longer than that in metal hydrides, and 
a C-H distance significantly longer than those in 
typical hydrocarbons.436 Both infrared and NMR 
experiments have also highlighted the existence of 
C-H bonds with low stretching frequencies and 
W-H coupling constants. It is interesting to note, 
although, that theoretical studies have revealed that 
the complete transfer of the a hydrogen to the 
tantalum center is symmetry forbidden, which ex- 
plains why the original reactants are so stable.323

The product distribution shown in 
the righehand side highlights the fact that even though 
close to 85% of the desorbing methane is composed of the 
CH, and CH3D that results from direct reductive elimina- 
tion of normal methyl groups with coadsorbed hydrogen 
or deuterium atoms, there is an additional 8% of CD4

groups prior to methane formation. An analysis of the 
kinetic data obtained from these experiments led to the

or electrophiles, or to undergo electrocyclic reactions 
in less reactive solvents. In polynuclear clusters 
they 
also rearrange in geometrical configurations which 
facilitate dehydrogenation reactions. For example, 
according to neutron and X-ray diffraction studies, 
the strong 
interaction in a Fe4 methylidyne butterfly 
complex between the hydrogen of the methyne and 
a wing of the frame results in a very short Fe-H 
distance and a long C-H bond. This suggests a 
three-center two-electron (agostic) 
bond between that 
CH and the metal frame which facilitates the re- 
moval of methyne hydrogen by weak bases such as 
methanol. Moreover, NMR studies indicate that a 
methyne hydrogen can exchange sites 
with a second 
bridged hydrogen within the same 
Since 
larger alkylidynes do not have a 
hydrogens, they can 
only dehydrogenate at other positions further away 
in the chain, a reaction that does take place in 
molybdenum553 
and tungsten5% 
monometallic com- 
pounds, but that is more common in bridging mul- 
ticenter complexes. In one case, p-bridged ethylidyne 
diiron complexes react with acids (or bases) to 
produce the corresponding p-vinylidene com- 
pound.555-557 
A similar conversion has recently been 
suggested in a triplatinum ethylidyne cluster.558 
The dehydrogenation 
of methylene 
groups on metal 
surfaces has only been inferred indirectly. On 
Pt(lll), 
for instance, the extensive H-D exchange 
of methyl groups observed in temperature-pro- 
grammed desorption experiments has led to the 
conclusion that methylene and methylidyne moieties 
must be present in equilibrium on that surface

this reaction also produces ethylene and ethyl groups, 
and may occur via bimolecular steps.194 Little is 
known about the mechanism for carbyne decomposi- 
tion (in spite of the extensive studies reported on the 
chemistry of alkylidynes). Ethylidyne is known to 
undergo H-D exchange, at least on platinum and 
rhodium surfaces, but the participation of an initial 
B-dehydrogenation step in the mechanism of that 
reaction seems unlikely.559 Alkylidynes do dehydro- 
genate to other species on most transition metals 
above 400 K, but the mechanism for this process is 
also unknown. 
5. Olefins 
Little is known about the breaking of C-H bonds 
in IC ligands coordinated to discrete compounds. 
Olefin-metal complexes are fairly stable but, if the 
olefinic ligand within a monometallic complex reacts, 
it usually does so by interacting with either nucleo- 
philic or electrophilic agents to form new ligands such 
as aldehydes, ketones, vinyl ethers, vinyl acetates, 
amines, and olefin dimers.560 Oxidative addition 
reactions are not common in these compounds, but 
can be induced by carrying the reaction out in polar 
solvents or by substituting 
the vinylic hydrogen with 
more electronegative 
e1ements.m Vinyl bromides, for 
instance, can undergo oxidative addition at a metal 
center to form the corresponding complex. Details 
on the mechanism for the carbon-halide bond scis- 
sion have been difficult to obtain, because the rates 
of isomerization of many vinyl halide complexes are 
either too rapid for isolation of intermediates other 
than the vinyl adduct, or too slow to accurately 
measure reaction rates. The reaction between cis- 
or trans-,%bromo styrene and cobalt, platinum, or 
nickel complexes occurs with retention of configura- 
tion at the trigonal carbon,1zo561-s" 
and truns-l,2- 
dichloro ethylene also reacts with either PtL or PdL4 
(L 
= 
PhzMeP) complexes to afford the trans-2-chloro 
vinyl 
These oxidative addition reactions 
are presumably preceded by coordination of the 
reactant, since a variety of IC complexes have indeed 
been isolated and shown to undergo a unimolecular 
rearrangement to the oxidative a d d  c t .  ,    
The 
conversion of bPt(F2C=CFBr) into cis-LzPtBr- 
(CF-CF2), on the other hand, follows a first-order 
kinetics that depends linearly on the Grunwald- 
Winstein solvent parameter, suggesting a s N 1  
mech- 
anism instead!67 
Similar conflicting results have 
been obtained in studies on the activation of unsatur- 
ated C-H bonds: Jones and Feher have reported an 
example where $-arene coordination precedes the 
C-H bond-scission step in the aromatic ligand:@ but 
Stoutland and Bergman found another case in which 
the attack of the vinyl C-H bond in ethylene occurs 
before any n 
c0mplexation.5 
A few examples are also known for the oxidative 
addition of olefins to cluster compounds. The os3- 
(C0)9(SMe)(H2C=CHz) 
complex, for instance, con- 
verts to the corresponding vinyl complex.s7o Reac- 
tions of ethylene with either HzOS(CO)IO'

 The conversion of 
ethylene to vinyl can be clearly seen by the differences 
between these two spectra, 
which include the development 
of new peaks for the C-H stretching and in- and out-of- 
plane deformation modes around 2920,1405, and 760 em-',

complexes with ei- 
ther vinylidene or acetylenic ligands, most likely 
originating from the conversion of an initial vinyl 
intermediate, were isolated in all those cases. It is 
quite possible that metal clusters 
facilitate C-H bond 
activation reactions in coordinated olefins because 
they provide the framework for a multiply coordi- 
nated final vinyl product; the scission of vinylic C-H 
bonds in preference to allylic ones gives a clear 
indication of the unique chemistry generated by the 
presence of several m

atoms in a complex?" The 
contrast between this a-hydride abstraction chemis- 
try in clusters and the ovemding cyclometalation 
reaction preferred in mononuclear systems157 
may 
provide some clues for understanding the analogous 
surface processes. 
Olefin dehydrogenation reactions are apparently 
easier on transition metal surfaces than in the 
corresponding organometallic compounds. Perhaps 
one of the best examples for this type of reaction is 
the conversion of adsorbed ethylene to vinyl species 
that occurs on Ni(100) around 175 K (Figure 
12).1z7-129.584 
Kinetic studies proved that the ethyl- 
ene-vinyl conversion in that case is unimolecular, 
and that it displays strong normal primary and 
secondary isotopic effects, suggesting 
that the reac- 
tion is an elementary step. More commonly, chemi- 
sorbd ethylene converts directly to ethylidyne around 
room temperature. This 
latter reaction has so far 
been observed on single-crystal surfaces of ruthe- 
nium,212 rhodium,'44 iridium,'43 palladium,211 and 
platinum.13z07z10 
Although the mechanism for eth- 
ylidyne formation is still controversial, it most likely 
Frequsncylcm-'

involves two or more steps. Some evidence has

Alkynes, Dienes, and Arenes 
The chemistry of alkynes coordinated to metallic 
centers resembles in many ways that of olefins. 
When terminal acetylenes are x 
bonded to a transi- 
tion metal, they tend to rearrange into the tautomeric 
vinyl complex, presumably by going through a u-co- 
ordinated acetyl intermediate.587 For instance, Rh- 
(PR3)2(Cl)(HC=CPh) 
exists in equilibrium with its 
o-alkynyl(hydrid0) 
isomer, and this equilibrium shifts 
toward the latter compound upon addition of pyridine 
to the solution.588 In another example, propyne 
reacts with the highly nucleophilic Ir(C1)(PPh3)3 
complex to form a stable a-acetylenic iridium(I1) 
hydride.589 
In clusters the oxidative addition of the 
C-H acetylenic bond of terminal alkynes commonly 
yields either p2- or p3-alkynyl complexes.583 For 
instance, the reaction of phenyl acetylene with H2- 
Os3(C0)10 produces H O S  ( L L  - C W P  ) ( C O ) I O ,     
and 
the reaction of tert-butylacetylene with RUB(CO)I 
gives H R U  (   - C  C  B U ) ( C O )  .         
Even 2-butyne 
coordinates to HOS(CO)IO 
and converts to the cor- 
responding p3-l-methyl 
allenyl complex.592 
The thermal activation of acetylene on transition 
metal surfaces usually leads to its complete dehy- 
drogenation (at least under vacuum) via a series of 
ill-defined steps. The intermediate products from 
this conversion depend on both the nature and the 
crystallographic orientation of the  u r f a c e .    ,    
Sev- 
eral reports, some still contested, claim to have 
identified a single step for the transformation of 
chemisorbed acetylene into an acetylide moiety. 
Vibrational and electronic spectroscopic data have 
been used to support this mechanism on Rh(lll)148 
and Rh(100),144J45 
Ir(lll),la 
Ni(100),140593594 
Ni(l10),141 
and Pd(100).139 
A similar reaction has also been 
reported on Pd(lll), 
but the details of the chemistry 
of acetylene on that surface are still being de- 
bated.330,595 
Most of the reports mentioned above 
show that the a-hydride elimination of adsorbed 
acetylene takes place at reasonably high tempera- 
tures, above 400 K in some cases, and is often 
followed by some yet undetermined polymerization 
steps. 
Dienes in metal complexes, like other unsaturated 
x-coordinated ligands, rarely undergo hydride elimi- 
nation reactions, but rather react with either elec- 
trophilic or nucleophilic reagents.560,596,597 
The poor 
reactivity of the vinyl C-H bonds in dienes becomes 
particularly evident in ligands with allylic hydrogens, 
for which allyl formation is the only reaction ob- 
served. Examples of this can be seen in the chem- 
istry of tricarbonyl(cis-penta-l,3-diene)iron, 
which 
upon treatment with Ph&+ yields a dienyl com- 
p l e  ,   O  
of cyclopentadiene with nickel complexes, 
which produces a mixed y3,y5-complex 
after a se- 
quence of reactions that starts with the oxidative 
addition of one cyclopentadiene molecule to form a 
cyclopentadienyl hydride complex,598 
and of a cyclooc- 
tadiene-ruthenium complex, which also converts 
into the corresponding dienyl complex.599 No ex- 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2669 
amples are yet available for the elimination of 
terminal hydrogens in dienes adsorbed on surfaces. 
Oxidative additions of arene C-H bonds to metals 
have been known since 1965, 
when Chatt and David- 
son reported the reaction between naphthalene and 
a ruthenium complex to yield the corresponding aryl 
compound.600 
The more widespread occurrence and 
earlier observations of arene vs alkane C-H bond 
activation has led to the general belief that kinetic 
factors, namely, prior y2-arene coordination, are 
responsible for the different reactivity of the two 
types of bonding.601 
In particular, Jones and Feher 
have demonstrated that q2-arene coordination is 
required for the activation of a C-H bond in a 
benzene-Rh complex.568 The small kinetic isotope 
effect seen in the activation of benzene by (Me5Cp)- 
Ir(PMe3) also suggests an early transition state for 
the C-H addition, perhaps something like an initial 
agostic interaction, as in the reactions with dihydro- 
gen and alkyl 
On the other hand, since 
the difference in strength between metal-aryl and 
metal-alkyl bonds is greater than that between 
hydrogen-aryl and hydrogen-alkyl bonds, the case 
could also be made for thermodynamics been the 
dominant factor driving the arene a  t i v a t i o n .    ,  
The decomposition of benzene and of other arenes 
on transition metal surfaces has proven to be quite 
complex. The final products from these reactions, 
after the formation of a series of intermediates, are 
almost always hydrogen and surface carbon. The 
nature of those intermediates depend on the metal, 
but are mostly of the C,H type.14*J4' Surface cover- 
ages can also affect the decomposition mechanism. 
In some cases the adsorption geometry of benzene 
changes, from flat lying at low coverages to a tilted 
configuration near saturation,369,395,396,604 
inducing a 
transition from an initial zr resonant bonding to the 
y2 configuration supposedly involved in the C-H 
bond activation in organometallic complexes. Recent 
reports have in fact offered some evidence for the 
formation of a benzyne (C6H4) intermediate during 
the decomposition of benzene on OS(OOO) 
and Mo- 
(110) surfaces.365 
7. Allylic and Benzylic Bonds 
The activation of C-H bonds in olefins and sub- 
stituted aromatic ligands can occur either at the 
vinylic/aromatic or at the allylichenzylic positions. 
The selectivity between the two in principle depends 
on a number of kinetic, thermodynamic, electronic, 
and steric/geometric factors, but since the allylic/ 
benzylic C-H bond is considerably weaker than the 
vinylic/aromatic C-H bond (D(H-ally1) 
= 
89 kcal/mol 
vs D(H-vinyl) 2 108 
kcal/mol, and D(H-CH2Ph) 
= 
85 
kcal/mol vs D(H-Ph) = 110 kcal/moPo5), 
the former 
are in general more reactive. On the basis of this 
knowledge it is easy to understand why allyl ligands 
can be easily prepared from coordinated alkenes. For 
instance, the n-olefinic Ni(PPh3)CsHs 
complex equili- 
brates with its allyl hydride isomer NiH(PPh3)C3H5 
at temperatures as low as -40 0C,606 
and several 
substituted olefins react with certain palladium and 
iridium complexes to yield similar allyl p r o d  c t s .   ' ,     
The detection of zr-benzyl complexes has also been 
reported, either by itself, or in equilibrium with its 
2670 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 
+benzyl isomer,609,610 
and examples for dienes were 
mentioned before. 
To the best of our knowledge, the only clear 
example known so far for the conversion of olefins to 
allyl moieties on surfaces comes from the thermal 
activation of cyclohexene on Pt(lll), 
where the C6Hg 
intermediate isolated between 180 and 280 K was 
identified by vibrational spectroscopy as an allylic 
species,304,347,348 
but the reaction of isobutene with 
oxygen-predosed Ag( 
110) seems to produce a small 
amount of an allylic species as 
The scission 
of C-H bonds in substituted benzenes was shown to 
be regiospecific on Ni(lll), 
Ni(1001, 
Pd(lll), 
Pd(100), 
and Pt(ll1) 
surfaces.399,611-614 
The benzylic hydrogen 
is always removed first in those molecules, suggest- 
ing that the initial adsorption geometry of the ring 
is tilted, and that perhaps a x-benzyl intermediate 
forms after activation.400 
Even the decomposition of 
diphenylethane molecules on Pt(ll1) yields 1,2- 
diphenylethylene selectively.615 
B. C-H Bond Formation 
1, Alkyls 
One of the most common reactions both in orga- 
nometallic alkyl hydride complexes and on alkyl 
surface systems is the recombinatory 
reductive elimi- 
nation of the alkyl group with hydrogen to yield a 
free alkane. This reaction is in principle reversible 
(the 
reverse reaction being the oxidative 
addition step 
discussed previously), but usually goes only in one 
direction. The oxidative additiodreductive elimina- 
tion equilibrium is determined by the overall ther- 
modynamics 
of the system, and therefore depends on 
the relative stability of the product (an A-B mol- 
ecule) compared to that of the initial reactant (a 
M(A)(B) 
complex). This is why, on the one hand, 
alkyl halides add easily to metal centers but alkyl- 
halide adducts rarely eliminate back the free halide 
and, on the other, alkanes rarely oxidatively add to 
metals but alkyl-hydride complexes commonly elimi- 
nate alkanes. The reductive elimination of either an 
alkyl and a hydride or two alkyl groups is exother- 
mic: elimination of methane from Pt(PH3)2(CH3)H, 
for instance, releases an estimated 19 kcal/mol at 
room temperature.llg 
The reductive elimination of alkanes in metal 
complexes takes place with ease regardless of if the 
two ligands are bonded to the same or to two different 
metal centers. There are nevertheless some require- 
ments for this elimination reaction, which in the case 
of mononuclear compounds are rather obvious. For 
one, the two ligands to be eliminated must be 
coordinated cis to each other.616 Also, since the 
reaction is nominally accompanied by the reduction 
of the metal center, it is favored by additional positive 
charge on that meta1.617-619 
For the same reason, the 
removal of o-donor ligands usually accelerates the 
reaction,620-622 
although there are some notorious 
exceptions to this rule.623,624 
Lastly, elimination from 
three- or five-coordinate complexes is easier than 
from four- (planar) or six- (octahedral) coordinated 
c o m p o  n d s .    ,     
The formation of C-H bonds in reductive elimina- 
tion reactions is in general favored over H-H and 
Zaera 
C-C reductive couplings.627 
The preference for C-H 
over H-H bond formation can be explained entirely 
by thermodynamic arguments, but C-C coupling 
reactions, which are even more exothermic than the 
C-H counterparts, are slower because the transition 
state requires the reorientation of two highly direc- 
tional carbon-sp3 
hybrid orbitals.628 
Both the lack of 
isotopic scrambling in experiments with mixed la- 
beled compounds and the preservation of the stere- 
ochemistry of the coupling alkyl groups have also 
proven that reductive eliminations are in general 
concerted and that they occur without previous 
dissociation of the metal-carbon bond.629,630 
The 
observation of inverse kinetic isotope effects in some 
cases suggests the formation of a G adduct between 
the resulting alkane and the metal prior to dissocia- 
t i  n ,   O  
but the evidence for such an intermediate is 
not compelling. 
Examples have been reported for intramolecular 
reductive elimination reactions in gold, silver, copper, 
manganese, and cobalt c  m p l e x e s .   l -     
The elimi- 
nation of two organic ligands from a pair of metal 
atoms already joined by a bond, however, is sym- 
metry forbidden, and therefore quite rare.635 R-H 
elimination from two metal centers has been ob- 
served, but only after a P-hydride elimination step. 
For example, the decomposition of [Mo(NMe&OH2- 
CD3)12 affords the formation of a one-to-one 
mixture 
of ethylene CH2=CD2 and ethane C H Z D C D  .     
The 
same type of P-hydride elimination-reductive elimi- 
nation reaction sequence is common in dialkyl mono- 
nuclear compounds.493 
The hydrogenation of chemisorbed alkyl groups on 
transition metal surfaces has been reported on a 
number of systems. These C-H reductive elimina- 
tion reactions are common on most metals, but 
compete unfavorably with C-C coupling reactions on 
late transition metals67 
and are overtaken by dehy- 
drogenation reactions to surface carbon and hydrogen 
on early transition elements.34 The yield for the self- 
hydrogenation of methyl moieties to methane is quite 
high, between 50 and 75%, 
on Ru(OOO), 
Ni(100),39,40

and Cu(111)61 
single-crystal surfaces as 
well as on films of iron, nickel, palladium, lead, gold, 
and  o p p e r .   ,     
Ethane formation by ethyl elimina- 
tion is a less selective reaction, because ,&hydride 
elimination dominates in most cases where P hydro- 
gens are a  a i l a b l e .   ,     '   
Significant alkane desorp- 
tion does occur at about the same temperature as 
olefin formation on surfaces with high ethyl cover- 
ages, suggesting that a disproportionation reaction 
similar to that discussed above for dimolybdenum 
complexes is likely to take place on surfaces as well. 
Heavier alkyl groups generally behave in a fashion 
similar to ethyl m  i e t i e s .   ,     
The reductive elimination of alkanes can be greatly 
enhanced by coadsorbing hydrogen (or deuterium) on 
the surface: the thermal activation of methyl moi- 
eties on 
hydrogen-precovered Pt(lll)llO and 
Ni(100)l12 
surfaces leads to methane yields of nearly 
loo%, and the conversion of ethyl iodide to ethane 
increases by a factor of 5 on'Pt(ll1) 
after similar 
hydrogen treatments.lll These increases in yield 
with hydrogen coadsorption are also accompanied by

metal, or a basic c a t a l y  t .  -    
Finally, aryl- 
hydride complexes may undergo a reductive elimina- 
tion step similar to that in alkyl-hydrides to yield 
arenes:60 but since metal-aryl bonds are stronger 
than metal-alkyl bonds, the equilibrium in these 
cases favors the aryl-hydride side of the eqation." 
On surfaces, the hydrogenation of vinyl groups 
produces ethylene preferentially;130 
no cases have 
been reported to date for hydride addition to the j3 
carbon. Phenyl groups, prepared by decomposition 
of iodobenzene, can be hydrogenated to benzene on 
Ni(100)163 
and Cu(111)162 
surfaces. Given that not 
many examples exist for the clean isolation of acetyl- 
ides on metal surfaces, little is known about the 
reactivity of those moieties. 
Hydrocarbon 
groups multiple u-bonded to organo- 
metallic compounds 
can be hydrogenated as 
well. In 
the case of carbenes and carbynes this often occurs 
via a migratory insertion into a metal-H bond, and 
results in hydrogen addition at the a 
carbon. In- 
tramolecular reactions of this type appear to be fade, 
and are considered to be in many respects analogous 
to the migratory insertion of carbonyls. For one, the 
rate of reaction can be increased in both cases by 
placing a positive charge on the complex. Also, both 
conversions are often reversible, as in the case of the 
equilibrium between the methyl and methylene- 
hydride forms:30 or even between the alkyl-olefin 
and alkylidene-alkyl taut0mers,5 
of tantalum- 
based complexes. An interesting example of such 
reversible interconversions involving a late transition 
metal is that of a pentacoordinated Ir(II1) complex.M8 
Similar equilibria are 
also known in clusters: the 5- 
Os32-CHz)(CO)lo 
complex, for example, exists in 
tautomeric equilibrium with its HOS@-CH)(CO)O 
is0mer.5 
Alkylidyne-hydride complexes can exist 
in equilibrium with their corresponding carbene 
isomers the same way, especially in early transition 
metal compounds, and interchange via an agostic 
interaction between the carbene and the metal 
center?51 Alkylidyne clusters can even be hydroge- 
nated all the way to the free alkane.64s,650 
Several 
pieces of evidence suggest that in those cases the rate

This figure shows the ease with which most alkyl 
groups undergo reductive elimination reactions with coad- 
sorbed hydrogen (or deuterium): significant amounts of 
monodeuterated alkanes are produced below 200 K from 
linear alkyls such as ethyl, n-butyl, and n-hexyl, branched 
alkyls such as tea-butyl, and cyclic alkyls such as cyclo- 
hexyl. Double-coordinated metallacycles such as the met- 
allacyclopentane formed by decomposing 1,4-diidobutane 
also hydrogenates to the corresponding 1,Cdideuteriobu- 
tane. Alkyl-hydrogen reductive elimination reactions are 
common on most transition metal surfaces. 
a reduction of the energy bamer for the overall 
reaction, reflecting the fact that the rate-limiting step 
for alkane production is actually the C-H bond 
formation when hydrogen is present on the surface 
(which requires about 5-6 kcaVmol on either nickel 
or platinum), and not the processes responsible for 
supplying the required surface hydrogen, as in the 
self-hydrogenation case. Other alkyl groups can be 
eliminated as alkanes in a similar manner (Figure 
13).6"l 
2. Other a-Bonded Species 
The hydrogenation of a-bonded hydrocarbon spe- 
cies other than alkyls has not been studied in detail. 
In general, both vinyl and acetylide ligands tend to 
incorporate hydrogen atoms at the j
3
 position. For 
instance, hydride addition to the CZRUZ(CO)&- 
CH=CHz)+ 
complex predominantly yields the 
p-CHMe 
product,642 
even though some complexed ethylene is 
produced in that case as well. The formation of 
olefins (the a-addition product) in these systems is 
enhanced by the presence of bulky groups on the 
vinyl ligand, as in the case of a tetraruthenium 
p-vinyl complex with the j3 carbon of the vinyl 
attached to a diruthenium  a r b e n e .    
Analogously, 
acetylides are quite reactive toward electrophiles and 
undergo protonation at the j3 carbon: they form 
stable vinylidene complexes in the presence of ac- 
i d  ?    
The acetylide hydrogenation to vinylidene is 
common in monometallic complexes as well as in 
metal clsters.5 
This step is key in the tautomeric 
isomerization of acetylides to vinylidenes and is 
facilitated by either a formal positive charge on the 
steps increases in the sequence k(CX + 
H) < k(CHX 
+ H) < k(CH2X + H).

have shown that methane formation occurs 
around 300, 260, 230, 180, and 280 K respectively, 
indicating that methylene hydrogenation on transi- 
tion metals is facile. In fact, the formation of 
methane from chemisorbed methylene is often lim- 
ited by the decomposition steps that provide the 
required surface hydrogen; the hydrogenation steps 
themselves are much less activated. TPD experi- 
ments with diiodo methane on Ni(100), for instance, 
have shown 
that methane desorption occurs at 
lower 
temperatures and with higher yields in the presence 
of coadsorbed hydrogen."z Additional experiments 
with coadsorbed deuterium have also indicated that 
the methylene conversion to methane occurs in two 
separate steps, via the sequential reductive elimina- 
tion of methylene and methyl species with the coad-

tion of one hydrogen atom at a time.119,665 
The 
limiting step in most cases is the migratory insertion 
of the coordinated olefin into a metal-H bond (the 
reverse of the P-hydride elimination reaction dis- 
cussed before),666-668 
which is believed to require a 
four-center coplanar transition state with an agostic 
hydrogen atom simultaneously bonded to a carbon 
atom and the transition metal center. Such a mech- 
anism justifies the selective 
cis addition of the M-H 
bond to the olefin seen in most cases. The possibility 
of isolating the resulting alkyl intermediate and of 
studying its subsequent reductive elimination to the 
alkane is generally limited by the fast rate of the 
latter reaction. This is, however, not the case in 
cationic rhodium compounds, where the elimination 
controls the overall process at low temperatures.669 
An alternative mechanism has been proposed in a 
few cases, mostly for conjugated olefins, which in- 
clude the formation of an alkyl free radical,670 
but 
this pathway is not common, and since it is not 
relevant for comparisons with surface reactions, will 
not be discussed here. 
The order in which the reactants coordinate to the 
metal center during the hydrogenation reaction 
seems to depend strongly on the nature of the 
catalyst. In Wilkinson's catalyst, for example, a 
hydrogen molecule adds oxidatively to the metal 
center first to form a dihydride, and the olefin 
coordinates to this intermediate a f t e r  a r d .    .     
In 
some rhodium cationic catalysts, on the other hand, 
it is the olefin that ligates first.669 
In both cases the 
addition of the hydrogen molecule is dissociative and 
leads to the formation of a dihydride complex, but in 
other systems the formation of a monohydride com- 
plex takes place via a nonoxidative, one-step hetero- 
lytic cleavage instead.671 
Regardless of the order in 
which the ligands coordinate to the metal, however, 
the olefin usually needs to be attached to the metal 
before reacting (except in cases where a free radical 
is involved, see above), and the strength of this 
metal-olefin bond ultimately controls the selectivity 
of the catalyst. Consequently, 
terminal olefins, 
which 
are more strongly bonded to the metal, are in general 
more reactive than alkenes with internal C-C double 
bonds, and the cis isomers are usually more reactive 
than the trans  counterpart.' 
The hydrogenation of olefins (of ethylene in par- 
ticular) on single-crystal 
metal surfaces has also been 
studied in great detai1.586,672-674 
These studies in- 
clude the characterization of the thermal chemistry 
of olefins chemisorbed on both c1ean223,287,302,675 
and 
hydrogen- and/or d e u t e r i u m - p r e d o  e d    ,    -     
sur- 
faces under vacuum as well as catalytic work under 
atmospheric pressures.652,681-683 
The thermal activa- 
tion of alkenes on late transition metal surfaces 
almost always yields some alkane, even under vacuum 
conditions. This self-hydrogenation is initiated by 
the decomposition of some of the chemisorbed olefins 
on the surface and is followed by the incorporation 
of the resulting hydrogen atoms into other alkene 
molecules. In the presence of surface hydrogen, the 
initial step is bypassed, and ethane is formed at lower 
temperatures and with higher yields.676,678,679 
The 
incorporation of hydrogen into the olefin takes place 
in two consecutive steps, as indicated by the fact that 
sorbed hydrogen (deuterium), and that the latter is 
rate limiting, as in organometallic systems. On 
Pt(ll1) 
methylidyne hydrogenation is so fast that an 
equilibrium between methylidyne and methylene is 
rapidly established on the surface.536 
The estimated 
activation energy for methyl formation from meth- 
ylene in that case is less than 6 kcallmol, while that 
for methane production from methyl is about 17 kcall 
mol (Figure 11). Hydrogenation products have also 
been detected for ethylidene on Pt(lll).lg4 
Because alkylidyne groups are quite stable on 
metal surfaces, their hydrogenation is much more 
difficult to achieve. The reaction can be driven under 
atmospheric pressures of h y d r  g e n ,   l @   
but it has 
never been observed under vacuum conditions. Nev- 
ertheless, ethylidyne exchanges its hydrogens with 
surface d e  t e r i u m ,    ,     
and although the mechanism 
for that reaction has yet to be determined, it is logical 
to think that it most likely starts with a hydrogena- 
tion step (see later). 
Exposure of vinylidene complexes either to acids 
or to hydrogen gas leads to the incorporation of 
hydrogen atoms at the p position, the same as for 
vinyls and acetylides, and yields 
Hydrides can also add at the a carbon to produce 
vinyl derivatives, but only if the complex is not 
readily deprotonated by bases.657 
The formation of 
alkylidynes dominates in cluster systems, and has 
also been observed on both Pd(lll)204 
and Pt(lll).131 
In the latter case, however, the vinylidene to ethyli- 
dyne conversion 
involves the formation of an ethylene 
intermediate on the surface.

 Olefins 
The homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of olefins 
is one area within the field of organometallic chem- 
istry that has received a great deal of attention. 
Many catalysts have been developed for this purpose 
but, unfortunately, very few have shown to be of 
practical use to date.658-661 
A few special cases are 
worth mentioning here. For example, Wilkinson's 
catalyst, a RhCl(PPH& complex discovered in 1964 
by Wilkinson and Coffey, is the best known and most 
remarkable homogeneous olefin hydrogenation cata- 
lyst,659,662 
because it displays unique regioselective 
and stereoselective properties not matched by any 
known heterogeneous counterpart. A family of cat- 
ionic rhodium catalysts also yields high enantiose- 
lectivity in asymmetric hydrogenation processes,663 
and a highly stable iridium catalyst has been devel- 
oped for the fast reduction of hindered olefins under 
oxygen atmospheres.664 
A few of these homogeneous 
systems are used for specific synthetic processes, but 
heterogeneous catalysts are in general preferred 
because organometallic compounds are usually more 
sensitive to impurities, tend to promote olefin rear- 
rangements, and are quite expensive and difficult to 
recover. 
The majority of the organometallic olefin hydroge- 
nation catalysts available nowadays are coordina- 
tively unsaturated, since vacant sites are usually 
required for both the complexation of the substrate 
(the olefin) and the incorporation of the hydrogen 
atoms. Mechanistic studies indicate that hydrogena- 
tion occurs in a stepwise fashion, via the incorpora-

adsorb on the surface for the reaction to occur. In 
connection with this, recent laser-induced desorption 
kinetic studies have shown that at low enough 
temperatures the extent of the H-D exchange in 
ethylene coadsorbed with deuterium on F't(ll1) (a 
reaction believed to start by the migratory insertion 
of the olefin into the M-H bond, see below) is limited 
to a fraction of the total molecules and results in the 
incorporation of an average of only about one deute- 
rium atom per ethylene.686 This suggests that the 
mobility of hydrogen on the surface is hindered by 
the olefin and that the reaction only takes place 
within reactants adsorbed in close proximity to each 
other. Other complications have also been identified 
for the mechanism of the catalytic hydrogenation of 
ethylene under atmospheric pressures. In experi- 
ments using normal ethylene and deuterium, for 
example, ethane molecules with up to six 
deuterium 
atoms are produced (the main product being DI- 
ethane). Strongly bound carbonaceous deposits (eth- 
ylidyne moieties in the case of ethylene) also form 
on the surface within seconds of initiating the reac- 
tion; the role of those moieties in the overall mech- 
anism is still a matter of debate.S86.652.681.68z,687 
4. Alkynes, Dienes, Arenes, and Allyls 
Although not common, coordinated alkynes may 
sometimes 
undergo migratory insertion reactions into 
metal-hydrogen bonds in a similar fashion to that 
of  alkene.-" The insertion is usually syn, so the 
stereochemistry of the carbons is 
but the 
initially formed cis-vinyl complex can then isomerize 
to the tram tautomer (possibly via a q2-vinyl 
inter- 
mediate) if there is a vacant coordination site on the 
metal center.692 On the basis of both theoretical and 
experimental results, the reaction has been proposed 
to take place via a four-center transition state involv- 
ing the metal, the metal-coordinated hydrogen, and 
the two acetylenic  carbon!. 
The migratory insertion of conjugated dienes into 
metal-hydrogen bonds is much easier than that of 
simple olefins, mostly because they result in the 
formation of a stable n-allylic c o m p l e  ;   ' .     
the 
intramolecular character of this reaction is usually 
manifested in the stereoselectivity of the product. 
Arenes can also be hydrogenated with organometallic 
catalysts: some of those catalysts are capable of 
promoting hydrogenation of all but one aromatic ring 
in polycyclic c o m p o u n d  , 6   -     
while others can also 
hydrogenate benzene and other simple monocyclic 
 molecule.-' The reaction in the latter case is 
slow, usually starts after an induction period, and 
only proceeds for a few turnovers. High stereoselec- 
tivity has been reported in some cases,71-7n4 
but 
detailed studies are sparse, and the homogeneous 
nature of some of the reactions is doubtful. 
Some allyl complexes are highly electrophilic and 
can therefore be easily attacked by a variety of 
nucleophiles and electrophiles to yield the corre- 
sponding olefin. In the case of nucleophilic attacks, 
the addition always occurs at 
the noncomplexed side 
of the ligand. Olefin isomerization presumably pro- 
ceeds via an allyl complex i   t e r m e d i a t e .    .     
The hydrogenation of acetylene on single-crystal 
surfaces under vacuum has so far been reported on

The use of isotopic labeling has allowed for the identifica- 
tion of some of the mechanistic details of this reaction. The 
left panel, for instance, shows that c2D6, CzDsH, and 
C2D4H2 
are all produced from perdeuterioethylene coad- 
sorbed with normal hydrogen, indicating that ethylene 
hydrogenation is a stepwise reaction. The most likely 
mechanism for this reaction is one where the ethylene 
molecules are first inserted into metal-hydrogen bonds to 
form alkyl groups, and where those alkyl speeies then 
undergo a reductive elimination step with an additional 
hydrogen atom to 
yield ethane. The right panel shows that 
the desorption of ethane from ethyl groups takes place at 
much lower temperatures than from ethylene, which means 
that the initial alkyl formation is rate-limiting in olefin 
hydrogenation. The ethyl intermediates can also undergo 
a 8-hydride elimination step, leading to the fast ethylene- 
ethyl interconversion that explains the extensive H-D 
exchange observed in adsorbed ethylene. 
the hydrogenation of ethylene on platinum surfaces 
predosed with a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium 
yields a mixture of CZH, 
CZHD, 
and CZ&DZ 
(Figure 
14).679 
The first step in the conversion of alkenes 
to 
alkanes must be a migratory insertion of the olefin 
into a metal-hydrogen bond, which produces an 
alkyl moiety, and the second the reductive elimina- 
tion of that alkyl with an additional surface hydro- 
gen. The lack of any clear evidence for stereoselec- 
tivity in the addition of the hydrogen atoms into the 
double bond even in rigid molecules such as 
bicyclo- 
[2.2.2loctene or n o r b  r a n e     
provides convincing 
proof for the formation of the alkyl intermediate. One 
study has reported the syn addition of two deuteri- 
ums to the endo face of the double bond of norbor- 
nadiene coordinated to a dimethylplatinum moiety,= 
but that reaction is believed to occur on a solid P
t
 
surface after transfer of the ligand from the complex; 
the results were consistent with the mechanism 
proposed above where the formation 
of a surface alkyl 
moiety is followed by interchange with surface hy- 
drogen atoms. Lastly, the absence of any alkyl 
buildup on the surface during the reaction indicates 
that the first step must be rate limiting, in the same 
way as in organometallic compounds. The faster rate 
of the alkyl-hydrogen reductive elimination step 
has 
also been demonstrated by temperature-programmed 
desorption experiments (Figure 14). 
The order in which the hydrogen and the ethylene 
are adsorbed on the surface in vacuum studies also 
changes the kinetics of the hydrogenation reaction!" 
This is because there is a geometrical constraint on 
the way the olefin and the hydrogen atoms need to

and Pd(111),706,707 
and Pt(lll).708 
The unequivocal identification of a surface interme- 
diate could not be made in any of those studies, but 
self-hydrogenation to ethylene was observed in tem- 
perature-programmed desorption experiments on 
platinum and palladium. Hydrogen coadsorption 
facilitates the production of a small amount of 
ethylene on Ru(0001) around 175 K, presumably by 
first forming a vinyl intermediate around 150 
K. Also, 
only CzHzDz desorbs from deuterium-predosed 
Ru(0001) surfaces, indicating that no H-D scram- 
bling occurs in that system, but all D2-, D3-, and D4- 
ethylenes are produced on Pd(lll), supposedly by 
H-D exchange 
via a vinylidene intermediate.707 
The 
studies on palladium also highlighted the structure 
sensitivity of the hydrogenation reaction: ethylene 
formation occurs around 300 K on Pd(100), around 
320 K on Pd(lll), 
and not at all on Pd(ll0). A small 
amount of ethane is also produced from acetylene on 
Pt(ll1). 
To the best of our knowledge no hydrogenation 
reactions have been reported for either dienes or 
arenes on transition metal surfaces. One example 
is available in the literature for the insertion of allyl 
groups into M-H bonds, that of the n-allylic C6H9 
species that results from cyclohexene decomposition 
on Pt(ll1); that species incorporates a deuterium 
atom from the surface and desorbs as the olefin if 
bismuth is dosed after the first dehydrogenation 
step.304 
C. C-C Bond Activation 
Oxidative addition steps on metal centers like those 
discussed above for carbon-hydrogen bonds can in 
principle take place with carbon-carbon single bonds 
as well. Cyclopropane and a few other strained 
compounds do indeed react this way,251,256,709-712 
but 
in compounds with unstrained C-C bonds such 
cleavage is rare because the overall process is highly 
endothermic.llg Recent observations have lead to the 
suggestion that dehydrogenation steps on the coor- 
dinated hydrocarbon moiety are required to assist 
subsequent C-C oxidative additions.252 There are 
nevertheless some examples where this is not the 
case. For instance, a methyl group can be abstracted 
from a 1,l-dimethyl cyclopentadiene iridium com- 
 l e x ,  l   
and some aliphatic coordinated ligands can 
be converted to olefins via alkyl elimination at the ,
6
 
psition.'l-l 
P-Alkyl elimination steps are usually exothermic, 
but are not common because they compete unfavor- 
ably with P-hydride elimination. That obstacle can 
be overcome by blocking the /
3
 position (by using 
ligands without P hydrogens), or by choosing systems 
where olefin removal from the complex is favored (a 
condition needed to drive the equilibrium in the 
desired direction). P-Alkyl eliminations are well 
known for aluminum complexes in connection with 
Ziegler-Natta p r o c e s  e s ,    ,     
and are feasible in 
some organolanthanides as well.714,715 
Exo-Ring 
open- 
ing, a related reaction, occurs in both alkyl-scan- 
dium716 
and platinum complexes.717 
Metallacycles, on the other hand, quite often 
decompose via C-C bond breaking steps, via the 
equivalent of a P-carbene elimination step. The most 
common reaction of metallacyclobutanes 
in particular 
is their reversible fragmentation to the olefin- 
carbene isomer.720 
Metallacycles are often unstable 
and exist only as transient short-lived intermediates 
in olefin metathesis reactions,721 
but have been 
isolated in a few cases.722 Olefins can also form 
reversibly from metallayclopentanes. 
Theoretical 
calculations suggest that the transition state for 
metathesis requires the planes of the olefin and the 
carbene to be parallel to each other,724 
and some 
indirect experimental evidence is available to support 
this idea: most carbene-olefin complexes in which 
the carbene is perpendicular to the C-C bond are 
quite stable.436x725 
A few exceptions to this rule have 
been reported recently.726 
Carbon-carbon oxidative addition of double and, 
more commonly, triple bonds in unsaturated hydro- 
carbons coordinated to metal clusters are possible. 
For example, the activation of the carbon-carbon 
double bond in ethylene yields bridging methylenes 
in many bimetallic complexes.727 
Reported cases for 
the activation of triple bonds include the reaction 
between the hexanuclear OsS(C0)ls cluster and di- 
phenyl acetylene to form OSS(CO)U-CP)U-CP
the thermal conversion of the tetranuclear alkyne 
complex OSWC(H)(,M-RCCR)(CO)IO 
to the bis(a1- 
kylidyne) OSWC(H)@-CR)@-CR)(CO) 
and the addition of alkynes to other trimetallic 
c l  s t e r s .    ,     
Presumably, the alkyne needs to 
rotate during this reaction from its initial parallel 
coordination mode to a perpendicular configuration 
in order to migrate to the edge of the cluster, which 
is the initial step toward the C-C bond activation.730 
A few examples have also been reported for this 
reaction in complexes with only two metal cen- 
In heterogeneous systems carbon-carbon bond 
scission steps are the basis for well-established 
catalytic processes such as hydrocarbon hydrogenoly- 
sis, but nevertheless, little is known about the 
mechanism of this reaction. The activation of al- 
kanes and other saturated and unsaturated com- 
pounds seems to almost always be initiated by the 
breaking of C-H bonds, as only highly dehydroge- 
nated species seem prone to C-C cleavage. Perhaps 
the cleanest and most interesting example of a C-C 
bond-breaking reaction in surface science is the 
decomposition of neopentyl groups to isobutene on 
Ni(100) surfaces (Figure 
That reaction was 
shown to have an activation energy barrier on the 
order of 22 kcaymol, much higher than that for 
P-hydride elimination steps on the same surface. The 
mechanism by which the olefin is formed has not yet 
been determined, but, given that the decomposition 
of a,a-dideuterioneopentyl 
groups only yields normal 
isobutene (without any deuterium substitutions), a 
direct P-methyl elimination step can be d i  c a r d e d .    ,   
A P-methyl elimination step was also proposed for 
the formation of propylene from isobutyl moieties on 
aluminum 
but no direct proof was pro- 
vided to support that hypothesis. A third example 
of C-C bond scission reactions on surfaces is the 
conversion of a C4H4 cyclic moiety to vinylidene on 
Pd(111),266 
a reaction that takes place around 250 K, 
ters.732,733 
Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties 
most likely via an initial ring-opening step to form 
acetylene. 
Although to the best of our knowledge there are 
no other reported cases for isolated carbon-carbon 
bond-scission steps, those reactions take place in 
almost all hydrocarbodtransition metal surface sys- 
tems at high temperatures. Decomposition 
reactions 
are usually molecule or functional group specific 
below 400 K, but most hydrocarbon moieties seem 
to decompose to the same fragments above 500 K. 
Unfortunately, high-temperature activation of ad- 
sorbed carbonaceous moieties often produces a mix- 
ture of species on the surface, making the charac- 
terization of those species quite difficult. Vibrational 
and temperature-programmed desorption studies 
have narrowed down the possible candidates to CH, 
CzH, and/or partially hydrogenated polymeric carbon 
rings and chains. As a case in point, heating ethyl- 
ene, acetylene, or benzene on r  t h e n i u m , '

or platinum144 
surfaces above 500 K all produce a mixed layer of 
CH and CCH fragments. The formation of methyli- 
dyne (CH) clearly requires the breaking of at least 
one C-C bond, but the available data indicate that 
this only occurs after extensive dehydrogenation if

D. C-C Bond Formation 
1. Reductive Elimination of Alkyls 
Carbon-carbon bond-formation steps are the re- 
verse of C-C activation reactions, and usually occur 
by one of two paths, either by reductive elimination 
(or C-C coupling, the reverse of the oxidative addi- 
tion step discussed before), 
or by migratory insertion. 
Thermodynamically C-C coupling is favored over 
C-H and H-H elimination reactions, but kinetically 
the need for the reorientation of the two highly 
directional carbon-sp3 hybrid orbitals often makes 
those reactions slow.628 
A well-known example of a 
C-C coupling is the alkane formation from dialkyl 
mono-metallic 
a reaction that requires 
the two outgoing ligands to be oriented cis to each 
other.616 The elimination rate is enhanced both by 
a large positive charge at the metal center618s619 
and 
by prior coordination of another ligand.626 
Appar- 
ently this enhancement is due not only to the formal 
two-electron reduction of the metal center induced 
by the elimination, but also to geometrical effects 
related to the spatial distribution of the d orbitals in 
the metal: elimination from three- and five-coordi- 
nated complexes is much easier than from planar 
four-coordinated ones.735 
This also explains the dif- 
ferences in the way reductive elimination reactions 
take place in different metals. For example, four- 
coordinated Ni(PR&R2 compounds lose a R-R al- 
kane directly, but the equivalent Pd(I1) and Au(II1) 
complexes normally release one of the phosphine 
ligands first,616,621 
and Pt(I1) 
complexes usually react 
only after the previous oxidative addition of an alkyl 
halide.736 
C-C coupling reactions are believed to be elemen- 
tary and to take place intramolecularly, at least in 
monometallic complexes.616 
The elimination of two 
organic moieties coordinated to different metal cen- 
ters within the same compound is rare, and in the 
case of bimetallic complex is in fact symmetry forbid- 
den.635 
A great deal of indirect evidence also suggests 
that the formation of the C-C bond proceeds with 
retention of stereohemistry, 
and that the stability 
of the product often enhances the reaction rate. This 
is why both  i n y l - a l k y l     
and v i n y l -  i n y l     
elimi- 
nations, which yield coordinated olefins, are faster 
than alkyl-alkyl couplings. Octanuclear organocop- 
per clusters produce biaryls via the Ullmann coupling 
r e a  t i o n ,    ,     
while hexanuclear alkyl-aryl mixed 
complexes yield the alkyl-benzene cross-coupling 
product instead.742 The formation of a o

metal complex prior to the release of the free hydro- 
carbon molecule has also been suggested in some 
alkyl - 
alkyl elimination reactions. 
743 
Reductive eliminations often compete with dispro- 
portionation reactions. Late transition metals in 
general favor C-C coupling over ,&hydride or C-H 
reductive elimination steps. Alkyl-silver complexes 
yield dialkyl compounds almost exclusively. Iron 
compounds, on the other hand, usually produce 
alkane/alkene mixtures, and copper, gold, nickel, 
rhodium, platinum, and palladium compounds all 
produce varying mixtures of alkanes, alkenes, and 
dialkanes depending on the nature of the other 
 ligand., 
The reductive elimination of alkyl groups on sur- 
faces is known on late transition metals only (Figure 
15). For example, the thermal activation of methyl, 
ethyl, n-propyl, and isopropyl on Ag(ll1) surfaces 
yields ethane, butane, n-hexane, and 2,3-dimethyl 
butane respectively, 
all with 100% selectivity.66-68

surface 
coupling reactions compete with hydride elimination 
steps, especially at low alkyl  coverage., The rate 
of C-C coupling also seems to be directly related to 
the strength of the metal-carbon bond: the w.eaker 
the bond is, the faster the 
Methyl groups 
couple with high efficiency on Au(100) or Au(ll1) 
surfaces unless sites are blocked by other ligands,744 
but other alkyl groups disproportionate to a large 
extent, which means that the activity for C-C 
coupling on gold must be somewhere between that 
for the a- 
and /3-hydride elimination steps. The 
activation energies for both reactions are quite 
similar on copper, on the order of 20 kcaymol, 
suggesting that the selectivity toward reductive 
elimination reactions may at least in part be deter- 
mined by the ability of the metal to activate dehy- 
drogenation reactions.63 Also, coupling reactions are 
bimolecular, and therefore have kinetics that may 
depend strongly on the concentrations of the surface 
reactants. Finally, the rates for the coupling of CH2 
and CH3 moieties is faster on Cu(100) than on Cu- 
(110), indicating that the structure of the surface 
plays an important role in determining the kinetics 
of these reactions as well (Figure 15). It is conceiv- 
able that the actual C-C surface recombination step 
is fast and that the rate for alkyl dimerization is 
controlled by the diffusion of the reactants on the 
surface. 
In terms of relative rates for C-H vs C-C bond- 
forming reactions, it was found that coadsorption of 
hydrogen with phenyl groups on Cu(ll1)

interesting, because it proves that the product selec- 
tivity is controlled by the coordination number and/ 
or the geometry 
of the molecule. For example, while 
a 14-electron. three-coordinate complex undergoes 
,!%hydride 
elimination to butene, a 16-electron, four- 
coordinated compound decomposes via reductive 
elimination to cyclobutane, and an lSelectron, five- 
coordinated complex reacts by C-C bond scission to 
yield 
Multiply coordinated ligands can C-C couple as 
well. Some Fischer carbenes, for instance, can re- 
ductively eliminate to yield olefins,'95 and dialkyli- 
dyne complexes can produce acetylenes, both in 
m o n o m e t a l l i     .     
and in c l u  t e r '   - '    
compounds. 
In n 
ligands, diolefin complexes can oxidative couple 
to metallacyclopentane, most likely via the formation 
of a metallacyclopropane 
and di- 
acetylene compounds produce the corresponding un- 
saturated metallacycle (metallol) 
complex.754 In the 
homogeneous conversion of acetylenes to benzenes, 
which is commonly catalyzed 
by metal complees,1, 
blocking of the side reactions and use of bulky 
substituents allows for the isolation of CZ and C

 intermediate. 
Decomposition of metallacycles leads to the elimi- 
nation of cyclic hydrocarbons on silveF 
and nickel2" 
surfaces, but not on aluminum2" or palladium?* On 
Ag(lll), cyclopropane is produced from Cl(CH2bI 
decomposition (presumably via the formation of a 
metallacyclobutane).66 
Vinyl and phenyl groups also 
reductively eliminate on Ag(ll1) to butadiene and 
biphenyl, respectively,'" and 1,5-hexadiene 
forms by 
coupling 
of allyl groups on Ag(l10)?45 Perhaps more 
interesting, butadiene is produced with 100% ef- 
ficiency from vinyl on CU(OO),' 
even though hy- 
dride eliminations seem to dominate on other hydro- 
carbon-copper systems. Cycloalkenes from cyclo- 
propene to cyclohexene are produced on Ni(100) by 
thermal decomposition of the corresponding 1,n- 
diiodoalkane compounds.269 Methylene moieties 
couple very efficiently on silveF and c  p p e P @   
surfaces, but not at all on either nicke1112 
or plati- 
numlg3 
substrates. Finally, CH groups dimerize to 
acetylene above 250 
K on Ni(lll).79 
Perhaps the most interesting C-C coupling reac- 
tion reported so far on surfaces is the trimerization 
of acetylene on Pd(111).55''0775''5* 
A series of 
elegant isotope-labeling, structural, and reactivity 
studies 
have shown that this reaction takes place via 
an initial oxidative coupling of two acetylene mol- 
ecules to form a Pd-C4H4 metallocycle followed by 
the coupling of such an intermediate with a third 
acetylene to benzene. Several pieces of evidence 
support this 
mechanism: (1)

palladium surfaces exposed to acetylene molecular

Silver is an extreme 
case where the coupling not only occurs at lower temper- 
atures than on any other metal, but where it also takes 
place with 100% efficiency. Some ethane also forms on 
copper and gold surfaces, but only in competition with the 
produets of a-hydride and aky-hydrogen reductive elimi- 
nation reactions. This figure 
also shows how the maxima 
for ethane formation shifts from around 440 K on Cu(100) 
to 445 and 450 K on Cu(ll0) 
and Cu(lll), respectively. 
Although these temperatures depend somewhat on the 
initial methyl surface coverage, there is a clear difference 
in reaction rate on surfaces 
with different crystallographic 
orientations. This may be assoeiated with the ease with 
which alkyl groups diffise across surfaces 
inhibits biphenyl formation at 
the expense 
of benzene 
p r o d  c t i o n ; '    '    
C-H reductive eliminations steps 
are clearly favored in that case. On the other hand, 
phenyl groups act as efficient traps for alkyl radical 
intermediates: all methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and 
neopentyl groups couple with phenyl moieties below 
160 K to yield the corresponding alkyl benzene, 
indicating that alkyl-aryl coupling is favored over 
alkyl-alkyl frmation.' 
Other metals may promote 
coupling as well. For instance, the thermal activa- 
tion of methyl moieties yields ethylidyne moieties on 
Pt(111)747 
and Ru(OOO1P surfaces at high coverages. 
Although it is not yet clear what the mechanism for 
that reaction is, it 
most likely starts 
by an initial 
a-H 
elimination on methyl groups to produce methyli- 
dyne. No other alkyl coupling examples have been 
reported under vacuum to date.33

 Other Eliminations 
Reductive elimination from metallacycles usually 
yields cyclic compounds. A rhenium cyclopentane 
complex, for instance, undergoes sequential ring 
contraction and reductive elimination steps to pro- 
duce methyl cyclpropane? 
A better example is 
that of a nickel cyclopentane complex, which under- 
goes a reductive elimination step directly to yield 
cyclobutane?60 This latter system is particularly

3. Mgratoty Insertion 
The other common type of C-C bond-formation 
reaction is the migratory insertion of carbenes or 
olefins into metal-carbon bonds. Carbene insertion 
in organometallic complexes has been recognized only 
recently, and is not yet well understood. Several 
examples have been reported for what looks like an 
alkyl-carbene insertion, but in most cases the pre- 
sumed alkyl-carbene complex was generated in situ 
(usually from a dialkyl compound), and only the 
insertion product was identified.'67-7m 
This 
reaction 
can in principle repeat itself in a catalytic cycle to 
produce polymers, but this seems to be common only 
in the heterogeneous systems 
related to the Fischer- 
Tropsch proess."-' 
The insertion of coordinated 
alkenes into metal-alkyl bonds is also possible, and 
is in fact pivotal in the Heck reaction, where pal- 
ladium is complexed sequentially with an alkyl (R) 
group and an olefin (R"2C=CR'H) to produce a 
palladium hydride compound and the enlarged al- 
kene (R"2C=CR'R),?73 
in the Cramer mechanism for 
olefin dimerization,?" and in the Cossee mechanism 
for Ziegler-Natta  polymerization.?-"' All these 
reactions occur via syn additions with retention of 
onfiguration,? 
but the regiochemistry depends on 
the steric andlor electronic details of the complex, so 
that the new alkyl ligand can be formed by bonding 
of the old alkyl group to either the most (Markovni- 
kov) or the least (anti-Markovnikov) crowded carbon 
atom in the olefin .?75,779 Alkyl-olefin insertions are 
thermodynamically more favorable than hydrido- 
ole% insertions,

selectivity toward the latter  reaction.',' A

and thanks to the high stability of 
the resulting A complex, the insertion of conjugated 
dienes and other extended olefinic systems is even 
more faile.6 
Olefin insertion into metal-carbene 
bonds produces metallacyclobutane complexes; this 
reaction is not only common, but often reversible, and 
believed to be the basis for metathesis 
p r o c e  s e s . ?   .    
Also possible, although less common, is the insertion 
of alkynes into metal-carbenes or metal-p-alkyl- 
idenes; these reactions yield unsaturated cyclic com- 
p l e  e s  *   
or allylic  ligand,?. respectively. The 
latter two processes could in fact be the same, and 
the difference could just be due to a subsequent 
rearrangement of the p r o d  c t . '   *    
The only clear example of a migratory insertion 
reaction on metal surfaces is that of methylene into 
copper-alkyl bonds on copper single crystals ( F i v

.
 For instance, the thermal activation of mixtures 
of methyl and methylene groups coadsorbed on

yields significant 
amounts 
of ethylene, which 
is produced by B-hydride elimination from the ethyl 
moieties resulting from carbene insertion into the

followed by the p-hydride elimination from the resulting

substrates, for instance, ulti-

but the mecha- 
nism for that reaction is far from understood. 
E. Isomerization 
Apart f" 
hydrogenation-dehydrogenation steps, 
coordinated hydrocarbon moieties can also undergo 
isomerization reactions. One of the most common 
pathways for such tautomerism is via the shift of a 
hydrogen atom from one carbon to the next.793Jg4 
In 
particular, the interconversion of coordinated acety- 
lene into vinylidene moieties within organometallic 
complexes has received significant attention over the 
past decade.644-647795-803 
Several calculations indi- 
cate that metal-coordinated vinylidene ligands may 
be more stable than their acetylene counterparts, in 
spite of the fact that the opposite is true for the free 
gas-phase m o i e t i e  . ?   .     
The relative stability of 
these ligands is in fact controlled by several factors, 
including the d electron count in the metal center,644 
which is why their interconversion can indeed occur 
in both directions. 
The mechanism for the vinylidene-acetylene 
isomerization reaction is far from resolved. Two 
2678 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95,

routes have been extensively discussed in the litera- 
ture, the direct hydrogen slippage 
from one carbon 
to the next,797 
and the two-step conversion via an 
alkynyl intermediate.232 The latter did gain some 
support after the isolation of several alkynyl(hydrid0) 
complexes,645-647,7957g6 
but the prohibitively large 
barrier calculated for such a process makes the 
conversion of this hydrido-acetylide into vinylidene 
unlikely.801 In the end, both mechanisms may be 
operational depending on the characteristics of the 
system, since 18-electron filled-shell acetylene com- 
plexes cannot undergo the C-H oxidative addition 
step necessary to make the hydrido intermediate 
anyway. There has also been some discussion on the 
effect of the metal cluster size on the viability of the 
acetylene-vinylidene conversion. Such a transfor- 
mation was calculated to be unlikely for binuclear 
complexes,797 
but has nevertheless been observed 
experimentally in a few 
The isomer- 
ization of nonterminal alkyne complexes to allyl 
compounds has been reported as well.800 
The conversion of both alkenes into alkyli- 
denes643,804-806 
and alkenyls into alkylidynes are also 
possible.557,643806-810 
As in the case of the alkyne- 
vinylidene isomerization, the alkenyl-alkylidyne 
tautomerism is believed to often follow a two-step 
mechanism, since the reaction is in many instances 
driven by the addition of protons to the solution.806,808 
On the other hand, isotope labeling experiments 
provided strong evidence for a direct 1,2 hydrogen 
shift within the hydrocarbon moiety in a triosmium 
complex, without the direct participation of any of 
the metal atoms.810 Also, the rearrangement of 
alkylidynes to alkenyl complexes is accelerated by a 
higher degree of alkyl substitution at the p carbon 
of the hydrocarbon ligand,557 
and the kinetic product 
from the conversion of metal complexes with 1,2- 
disubstituted alkenes are the alkylidyne compounds.809 
Theoretical calculations on the latter suggest a 
transition state with a bridging hydrogen and a 
positive charge localized at the /
3
 position.811 
There have not been many reported instances of 
simple isomerization reactions on surfaces. One of 
the earliest examples of this was the intramolecular 
rearrangement of chemisorbed acetylene to vi- 
nylidene that occurs on Pd(ll1) 
between 220 and 270 
K139,204,241,595 
and on supported platinum around room 
temperature.242 
On Pt(lll), 
the thermal decomposi- 
tion of vinyl moieties yields acetylene and vinylidene 
moieties simultaneously, but there is no evidence for 
the interconversion of one species into the other.131 
The most studied case involving hydrogen tautom- 
erism in surface chemistry is by far the conversion 
of ethylene to e t h  l i d y n e ;     
this is a complex reaction 
and will be discussed in detail in the next section. 
Acetylene can also isomerize to ethylidyne if hydro- 
gen is coadsorbed on the surface,204,210,705 
in the case 
of supported platinum via the formation of vi- 
n  l i d e n e .    .     
Other types of isomerizations, such 
as C-C double- or triple-bond migration, cis-trans 
isomerization in olefins, and shifts of methyl and 
other carbon-containing fragments are all known in 
organometallic  y  t e m  ,    ,    ,     
but have, to the best 
of our knowledge, never been observed in surface 
science studies. 
Other more complex isomerization reactions have 
also been reported. Coordinated cyclic compounds, 
for instance, sometimes undergo ring-expansion or 
ring-contraction reactions. A cycloheptatrienyl-cr- 
(C0)s cation, for instance, reacts with cyclopentadi- 
enyl ions to yield the ring-contracted chromium- 
benzene neutral c o m p l e  .    ,     
Labeling experiments 
proved that the arene six-membered ligand in that 
case is formed from the tropylium ring rather than 
from the cyclopentadienyl ring.597 
Adsorbed cyclo- 
heptatriene was also shown to yield benzene on a 
carbon-passivated W(100) surface.815 In another 
example, 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclooctatetraene 
reacts 
spontaneously when coordinated to a Fe(C0)3 com- 
plex to produce the corresponding [4.2.Olbicyclic 
 omp pound,, and a similar ring contraction has 
been recently reported on Pt(ll1) surfaces.818 Fi- 
nally, the conversion of 1-methylcyclopentene 
to ben- 
zene has been observed on Ni(100).163 
F. Multiple-Step Reactions 
1. Dehydrogenation 
In addition to the studies of elementary steps 
discussed in the previous sections, some research has 
been carried out on more complex surface reactions. 
Reactions involving multiple hydrogenation-dehy- 
drogenation, hydrogen shift, and H-D exchange 
steps have received special attention in recent years. 
The conversion of alkenes to alkylidynes mentioned 
in the previous section falls in this category. This 
reaction, which takes place on almost all late transi- 
tion metal surfaces, is believed to follow a multistep 
mechanism that includes a 1,2 hydrogen-shift step. 
Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to deter- 
mine the actual sequence of elementary steps that 
take place in that reaction. TPD, N E W S ,  
SSIMS, 
and RAIRS experiments all have proven that ethyli- 
dyne formation follows first-order kinetics,585,819-824 
but recent studies have pointed to two kinetic re- 
gimes for the decomposition of ethylene, a slow one 
at saturation, and a faster one at lower coverages.825 
This means that the rate of ethylene disappearance 
diverges from that of ethylidyne formation in the low 
coverage regime, suggesting that another species 
accumulates on the surface. Nevertheless, no inter- 
mediates have been isolated for this reaction to date. 
Also, recent studies have indicated that the mecha- 
nism of this reaction is more complicated than 
initially thought. For example, a recent STM study 
has shown that the kinetics for the conversion of 
ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(ll1) 
may depend on the 
availability of the appropriate ensemble of metal 
atoms, since the reaction appears to take place 
preferentially on the boundaries between the islands 
formed by ethylene and ethylidyne.216 
Infrared and 
laser-induced desorption experiments with labeled 
ethylene and deuterium have shown that ethylene 
exchanges its hydrogen atoms simultaneously during 
the formation of ethylidyne as we11.559,686 
Several pathways have been proposed in the lit- 
erature for the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne 
tries to explain this reaction must include at least 
two steps in order to account for the changes that

Figure 17. Proposed 
mechanisms for the conversion of 
adsorbed ethylene into ethylidyne species on transition 
metal surfaces.6a6 
Three intermediates have been suggested 
for this reaction, namely, ethyl, ethylidene, and vinyl 
species. The lack of a significant buildup of any species 
other than ethylene and ethylidyne during ethylidyne 
formation 
argues for a mechanism with an initial slow step 
or, more likely, for a fast equilibrium between ethylene and 
a second species. Ethylidyne and ethylene are 
both much 
more stable than any of the other proposed species, so if 
such an equilibrium were to be established, the second 
moiety would have to be present in small concentrations 
on the surface at 
all times during the ethylene conversion. 
In addition, given that the rate for ethylidyne formation 
is independent of the surface coverage of coadsorbed 
hydrogen,"86 
the most likely mechanism for ethylidyne 
formation is that involving ethylidene. 
Note, however, that 
an equilibrium between ethylene and ethyl must also exist 
on the surface, since such interconversion 
is believed to be 
responsible for the extensive ethylene H-D exchange that 
takes place concurrently. 
take place within the surface moieties, namely, (1) 
a 
removal of a hydrogen atom (the breaking of a C-H 
bond), and (2) a transfer of a second hydrogen from 
one carbon to the other. Two 
straightforward se- 
quences can be proposed for this, one where the 
hydrogen transfer is followed by the hydrogen re- 
moval, in which case an ethylidene (CHCH3) inter- 
mediate is formed, and a second one where the 
hydrogen removal occurs first, and a vinyl-like 
(CH-CH2) intermediate is involved instead. Prece- 
dents for the first step of both schemes exist in the 
organometallic l i t e r a t  r e , 6   .    
but results from ki- 
netic experiments with trideuterioethylene (CHD- 
CDz) on Pt(ll1) 
ruled out the simple two-step ir- 
reversible sequence 
via an 
ethylidene intermediate,% 
and studies on the surface chemistry of vinyl iodide 
argue against the idea of a pathway involving vinyl 
intermediates as well.i31 A third proposal is that 
ethyl groups may coexist in small concentrations on 
the surface throughout the course of the reac- 
perhaps in equilibrium with the adsorbed 
ethylene. This equilibrium would not only explain 
the ease with which ethylene exchanges its hydrogen 
atoms, but could also account for the formation of 
ethylidyne via a short-lived ethylidene intermediate. 
On the other hand, recent RAIRS experiments have 
shown that the rate of ethylidyne formation is not 
affected by the presence of coadsorbed hydrogen on 
the surface.686 At the present time, the best mech- 
anism appears 
to be one involving a direct ethylene- 
ethylidene fast interconversion followed by the a- 
elimination of ethylidene to ethylidyne, but more 
work is needed to resolve this issue. 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vci. 95, No. 8 2679 
Another good example of the type of reactions that 
most likely involve multiple steps is the dehydroge- 
nation of alkenes to alkynes, 
the best example being 
the dehydrogenation of ethylene to acetylene on 
Ni(lll).289,424,830-"2 
According to secondary ion mass 
spectrometric studies, the acetylene formation begins 
around 165 K and is over by about 215 K, at which 
point all 
the surface ethylene has been consumed and 
the resulting acetylene starts to dehydrogenate to 
other s p e  i e s .    ,     
Recent structural experiments 
suggest that the two hydrogen atoms could be lost 
simultaneously from the ethylene molecule in a 
concerted step, either via cis elimination with trans- 
lation of the molecule to a new adsorption site, or by 
trans elimination and rotation around the symmetry 
axis of the molecule along the surface 
This 
is consistent with the fact that no intermediates 
have 
been identified for this reaction. It is interesting to 
note that the mechanism of dehydrogenation reac- 
tions depends on the structure of the surface (at 
least 
under vacuum), since the thermal activation of eth- 
ylene on Ni(100) 
and Ni(ll0) 
crystals 
yields vinyl and 
acetylide species, r e s p e c t i  e l y .         
This structure 
sensitivity may be related to the need for a reason- 
ably large ensemble of metal atoms in order for the 
reaction to occur: the adsorption of ethylene and 
acetylene involves a minimum 
of four and two surface 
nickel atoms, respetively,3J 
and each extra hy- 
drogen requires one hollow site with another three 
Ni atoms. In the case of the dehydrogenation of 
cyclohexane en platinum, the blocking of surface sites 
by gold deposition increases the selectivity for cyclo- 
hexene over benzene 
production, presumably 
because 
a larger site is required to accommodate the extra 
hydrogen atoms from benzene formation (Figure 
18).833 
Since such large ensembles are difficult to 
emulate with organometallic clusters, it may be 
difficult to reproduce these surface reactions in the 
homogeneous phase.

 Hydrogenation 
The most widely studied example of a hydrogena- 
tion reaction is the conversion of ethylene to ethane. 
Temperature-programmed desorption experiments 
on Pt(ll1) 
have shown that ethylene self-hydroge- 
nates around 300 
K at saturation coverages (Figure 
14). The reaction yield, however, is quite low, on the 
order of a few percent.223 Ethylene self-hydrogena- 
tion has also been observed on Ni(ll1) under high 
presures,6 
and on Pd(ll1) in molecular beam 
studies at 
room temerature.' 
On the other hand, 
no detectable ethane formation from adsorbed eth- 
ylene has been observed on nicke1,i41.594,831 
pal- 
ladim,2,@.836 
rhodium;% 
or ruthe- 
self-hydrogenation reaction could in principle occur 
via the direct disproportionation of two adsorbed 
ethylene 
molecules, but isotope-labeling 
experiments 
indicate that it takes place by incorporation of surface 
hydrogen atoms (either from decomposition of eth- 
ylene, or from hydrogen adsorption from the back- 
ground) i n  t e a d ?   .     
Coadsorption of hydrogen with ethylene on the 
surface enhances the ethane yield on Pt(lll),676,679 
and induces ethylene hydrogenation on Ni(100),678

 Selectivity results for hydrogenation-dehy- 
drogenation reactions with cyclohexane and cyclohexene 
on platinum single-crystal 
surfaces. 
The left panel displays 
changes in selectivity 
for cyclohexene over benzene forma- 
tion from cyclohexane dehydrogenation on Pt(100) as a 
function of epitaxially deposited gold coverage.833 
The 
relative increase in cyclohexene 
formation 
with increasing 
gold site-blocking 
indicates that dehydrogenation 
reactions 
require large metal ensembles on the surface and that the 
more extensive the dehydrogenation is, the larger the 
ensemble 
needs to be (because additional space is required 
to accommodate the leaving hydrogen atoms). The right 
panel shows the dramatic changes in selectivity for cyclo- 
hexene conversion with total pressure on Pt(2231, from 
benzene production, which is favored at low pressures, to 
cyclohexane formation, 
which dominates at high pressures. 
This selectivity change is again due to the effect that site 
blocking has on dehydrogenation reactions: under high 
pressures the surface is covered with a layer of hydrocarbon 
species which selectively poisons dehydrogenation over 
hydrogenation reactions. 
Ni( 
110),838 
Rh(111),286 
and Fe(100).839 
Experiments 
with deuterium and with deuterated ethylene have 
demonstrated that hydrogenation is stepwise, occur- 
ring via the migratory insertion of ethylene into a 
metal-hydrogen bond followed by the reductive 
elimination of the resulting alkyl intermediate with 
a second coordinated hydrogen atom (Figure 14).679 
The first step in this mechanism is believed to be rate 
limiting and the second to most likely compete with 
the P-hydride elimination that regenerates the origi- 
nal ethylene molecule.679 
The activation energies for 
the ethyl formation (migratory insertion) and ethane 
desorption (reductive elimination) steps have been 
estimated to be about 13 
and 5 kcaVmo1 
respectively 
on Pt(lll),lll 
and around 10 kcaVmol and less than 
5 kcaVmol on Ni(100).41 
Although all these observa- 
tions are consistent with what is known about 
catalytic hydrogenation in homogeneous phases,llg 
the surface systems are still unique in that the local 
arrangement of the adsorbed species (ethylene and 
hydrogen atoms) affects the hydrogenation kinetics: 
both the yield and the desorption temperature of the 
resulting ethane change considerably depending on 
the dosing order of the reactants.678 
This suggests 
that hydrogen mobility in these crowded substrates 
plays an important role in determining the rate of 
the overall process. 
Ethylene formation from acetylene provides an- 
other good example of a hydrogenation reaction. 
Acetylene self-hydrogenation has been observed only 
on p a l l a d i  m    ,     
and platinum708 single-crystal 
surfaces. Of particular interest is the fact that 
ethylene is produced on Pd(100) 
and Pd(lll), 
but not 
on Pd( 
1 
10).7063840 
Hydrogen coadsorption enhances 
the production of hydrogenated compounds on all 
surfaces, as in the case of ethylene. On palladium, 
for instance, coadsorbed hydrogen shifts the selectiv- 
ity from acetylene trimerization (to benzene) to 
ethylene production.707 
On Pt(lll), 
ethylene forma- 
tion is also accompanied by a small amount of ethane 
desorption,708 
but on palladium this does not happen 
because of the particular ease with which ethylene 
desorbs from that 
presumably this is the 
reason why palladium is such a selective catalyst for 
partial hydrogenation reactions. A small amount of 
ethylene can also be produced by thermal activa- 
tion of acetylene coadsorbed with hydrogen on 
R u ( O O O  ) .     
Isotope labeling and surface character- 
ization experiments suggest that the hydrogen in- 
corporation in all these cases is stepwise: on 
Ru(0001), for example, the identification of a vinyl 
intermediate was inferred from vibrational data. 
A third example of unsaturated hydrocarbon hy- 
drogenation is that of cyclohexene. On platinum 
single crystals, the thermal activation of cyclohexene 
coadsorbed with hydrogen leads to the production of 
some cyclohexane, but only in small quantities; the 
preferred product is 
However, this 
selectivity changes by several orders of magnitude 
as the total pressure is increased even if the hydrogen- 
to-cyclohexene 
ratio is kept constant, to the point that 
cyclohexane becomes the dominant product under 
atmospheric pressures (Figure 18).842-844 
The hydro- 
genation of more stable surface moieties such as 
alkylidenes and alkylidynes is also possible. Meth- 
ylene moieties, for instance, hydrogenate on 
Pt(lll),52J88 
Ni(100),l12 
and Rh(111)la6 
in a stepwise 
manner, via the sequential formation of methyl and 
methane. On nickel in particular, it was shown that 
the limiting step is not the migratory insertion step 
that yields the methyl intermediate, but the subse- 
quent reductive elimination of that methyl with 
surface hydrogen to produce methane. Methylidyne 
can also be hydrogenated all the way to methane on 
Pt(ll1) 
in a stepwise sequence of reactions where the 
final hydrogen incorporation step is rate limiting.536 
Ethylidyne, on the other hand, is much more difficult 
to hydrogenate. This reaction seems to be possible 
on Pt(lllP51 
but not on Rh(lll),652 
and only above 
room temperature and under atmospheric hydrogen 
pressures.

.
 H-D Exchange 
In the presence of surface deuterium hydrogena- 
tion-dehydrogenation reactions are often accompa- 
nied by H-D exchange. For example, when ethylene 
is coadsorbed with deuterium on Ni(100)678 
or 
Pt(111),559 
significant exchange is observed. This 
reaction could in principle take place via an initial 
oxidative addition of the alkene followed by a reduc- 
tive elimination of the resulting vinyl with a deute- 
rium atom, but most likely proceeds via an initial 
insertion of the coordinated olefin into a metal- 
deuterium bond and a subsequent P-H elimination 
from the resulting ethyl intermediate.llg On Pt(lll), 
mixtures of normal and fully deuterated ethylenes 
show WD scrambling even in the absence of coad- 
sorbed hydrogen or deuterium, probably because the 
Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties 
decomposition of some of the adsorbed ethylene 
provides the H and D atoms required for the ex- 
change.559 Hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms also 
exchange in alkyl groups on Pt(lll), but not on 
Ni(100); 
in fact, almost 10% 
of the methane produced 
by hydrogenation of normal methyl groups with 
deuterium on Pt(ll1) 
under vacuum is fully deuter- 
ated (Figure 11).535 
A fast equilibrium between 
methylidene and methylidyne may be responsible for 
the extent of that exchange.536 
Much less (although 
still noticeable) exchange is also observed in ethyl 
groups on Pt(lll).lll 
Examples of H-D exchange reactions in alkyli- 
dynes include those of ethylidyne on Pt(111),223,559687845 
Rh(lll),6523824 
and Ir(lll),677 
and of propylidyne on 
Pt( 
lll).846 
Because this reaction requires a large 
ensemble of surface atoms, however, it is usually slow 
at saturation coverages; only atmospheric pressures 
lead to significant exchange in that case.652 
On the 
other hand, appreciable exchange takes place under 
vacuum at submonolayer 
alkylidyne  coverage.,, 
Also, H-D exchange is a couple of orders of magni- 
tude slower in propylidyne than in ethylidyne, sig- 
naling that steric effects are important in determin- 
ing the rate of the reaction.846 
Nevertheless, 
exchange 
occurs by incorporation of one deuterium at the time 
in all cases. Several mechanisms have been pro- 
posed: (1) 
the direct formation of an alkylidene by 
a-deuterium incorporation, followed by migration of 
a p hydrogen to the a position (to yield the mono- 
deuterated alkene), formation of an alkylidene with 
one deuterium in the ,
8
 position (by the reverse 
reaction), and a-elimination to the monodeuterated 
alkylidyne; (2) the loss of a p hydrogen from the 
alkylidene to form an a-deuterated vinyl followed by 
hydrogen incorporation at the p position; (3) the 
concerted ,+hydride elimination and a-P hydrogen 
shift in the alkylidene; or (4) 
the initial alkylidyne- 
vinyl rearrangement prior to the formation of either 
alkylidene or alkene. The first two mechanisms are 
unlikely because alkylidenes are less stable than 
either alkenes559 
or vinyls,131 
and the third because 
it does not satisfy the principle of microscopic revers- 
ibility (the transition state should be at the middle 
of a symmetrically looking reaction coordinate), but 
the fact is that there is not enough experimental data 
to assess the validity of any of these proposals with 
any certainty. 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2681 
namely, that of the desorption of methyl groups from 
Cu(ll1) 
surfaces.59 The Cu-CH3 bond in that case 
cleaves at around 470 K (which corresponds to an 
activation energy of about 29 kcallmol), in one of a 
family of parallel reactions that also include the 
conversion of methyl to methane, ethylene, and 
propylene. The formation of free alkyl radicals from 
other chemisorbed hydrocarbons, on the other hand, 
can be close to isoenergetic; methyl radicals, for 
instance, are ejected into the gas phase after activa- 
tion of methyl iodide on Cu(111)59,60,633746 
and 
Ni(100),76 
and of methoxy on M o (  O O ) .     
Organic ligands in metal complexes may also be 
displaced by either nucleophiles or electrophiles. The 
simplest case of a nucleophilic attack is the transfer 
of a coordinated alkyl from one molecule to another 
which lacks such ligand. This reaction is reasonably 
facile and follows a s N 2  mechanism with inversion 
of configuration at the carbon a t  m .    ,     
Cleavage 
of o alkyl-metal bonds by other nucleophiles 
is much 
less common (because 
the metals involved usually are 
poor leaving groups), but it can be promoted by 
increasing the oxidation state of the meta1.856,857 
On 
the other extreme, the removal of an organic ligand 
from a transition metal by an electrophile is most 
commonly done by using 
In that case 
the reaction retains the stereochemistry of the leav- 
ing gr0up,6299860 
presumably because it occurs via an 
attack and coordination of the electrophile to the 
metal center prior to the reductive elimination step.llg 
Both halogens (X2) and mercuric halides (HgXd also 
favor this type of reaction, but if a sufficiently good 
electrophile is produced during the process (i.e., X- 
during an 
XZ 
cleavage reaction), the selectivity shifts 
toward the direct attack on the a carbon to displace 
the metal with inversion of stereochemistry (an s N 2  
mechanism).861 Again, only a few examples are 
available on metal-surface systems for either nu- 
cleophilic or electrophilic attacks on hydrocarbons. 
One example is the displacement of propyne, propy- 
lene, or trimethylbenzene (but not hexa-methyl ben- 
zene) by triethylphosphine on Pd(111).612 
Trimeth- 
ylphosphine is also capable of displacing a number 
of adsorbates on copper surfaces,862 
and the ability 
of bismuth to displace many chemisorbed moieties 
has been used to develop a method for adsorbate 
identification based on a variation of temperature- 
programmed desorption pectroscopy.@ 
Finally, 
a closely related reaction, the concerted displacement 
of the iodine atom in alkyl iodides by adsorbed 
hydrogen to produce the corresponding alkane, has 
been seen on Ni(100) substrates.865 
G. Other Reactions 
Another possible way in which alkyls and other 
hydrocarbon moieties bonded to metal centers may 
decompose is via the homolytic scission 
of the metal- 
carbon bond to yield free radicals. However, because 
of its high activation barrier (the energy of the 
carbon-metal bond), this reaction is not common: in 
the case of alkyl moieties, energies on the order of 
30-50 kcaymol are required both in organometallic 
c o m p  u n d s    -     
and on surfaces.4062102110111 
Theo- 
retical studies predict that this reaction should take 
place mainly on early transition metals,847 
but most 
experimental examples reported so far come from 
complexes of platinum,109,743,848 
copper,850,851 
and silver.852 
Only one example has at present been 
reported for this type of reaction on solid surfaces, 
H. Catalytic Processes 
1, Dehydrogenation 
Transition metal surfaces are well-known catalysts 
for a wide variety of hydrocarbon conversion reac- 
tions. Many experiments have been carried out on 
single-crystal surfaces in order to establish a con- 
nection between the insights obtained using modern 
surface-sensitive techniques under vacuum and this 
catalytic activity. A recent publication reviews most 
of this work, which includes studies on CO metha- 
nation, olefin hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hy- 
2682 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 
drogenolysis, isomerization and cyclization of al- 
kanes, and acetylene cycltrimerization. 
In view 
of this, only the most important conclusions 
reached 
so far in terms of mechanisms for hydrocarbon 
catalytic processes will be summarized here. 
The most studied dehydrogenation reaction in 
surface science has been the conversion of cyclohex- 
ane. This process has been characterized on plati- 
num,866 
ruthenium,867 
and tungsten868 
single crystals. 
Benzene is the major product in all the cyclohexane 
conversion reactions reported to date, but cyclohex- 
ene, n-hexane, and other lighter alkanes are often 
produced in smaller quantities. Both the dehydro- 
genation activity and its selectivity are quite sensitive 
to the structure of the surface, indicating that 
reasonably large ensemble sites with specific geom- 
etries are involved. Indeed, studies on gold-plati- 
num alloys with different compositions proved that 
dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions re- 
quire different geometrical arrangements on the 
surface.833,869,870 
Cyclohexene is an intermediate in 
the transition from cyclohexane to benzene, and its 
yield can be enhanced by blocking surface sites with 
gold atoms (Figure 18). On the basis of the UHV 
studies reviewed above, both cyclohexyl and allyl 
moieties have been proposed as additional intermedi- 
ates for this reaction. 
Other alkanes, once activated and converted into 
alkyl species, 
dehydrogenate W h e r  
with ease. Given 
the fast rates of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation 
reactions under the conditions used in most re- 
forming experiments, however, an equilibrium is 
usually reached between alkanes and alkenes within 
a few minutes.871 Furthermore, given the high 
hydrogen pressures in the reaction mixtures during 
catalysis, the equilibrium is generally almost com- 
pletely shifted toward the alkane.872 
In the case of 
cyclohexene, where dehydrogenation to benzene com- 
petes with hydrogenation to cyclohexane, the selec- 
tivity between these two paths changes dramatically 
with total pressure, even if the Hdcyclohexene ratio 
is kept constant: the production of benzene domi- 
nates at low pressures 
Torr), but cyclohexane 
is formed almost exclusively under high pressures 
(lo2 Torr) (Figure 18).842 
At low pressures these 
reactions proceed over clean metal surfaces, and 
therefore are structure sensitive,873 
but under atmo- 
spheric pressures they become structure insensitive, 
presumably because the continuous presence of about 
a monolayer of strongly bound carbonaceous species 
blocks the surface d e f e  t s .    ,     
This behavior is 
general in hydrocarbon reforming reactions 
.672,674,874,875 
2, Hydrogenation 
The best known class of hydrogenation reactions 
is that of alkenes. Olefin hydrogenation has been 
studied for ethylene on Pt(111),681 
Rh(111),lU 
Ni(100), 
Ni(lll), 
and Ni(l10),876 
for propylene on Ir(ll1) 
and 
I r ( l l O ) - ( l  2 ) ,     
for 1,3-butadiene 
on Pt(lOO), P t ( l l O ) ,  
and Pt(111),8783879 
and for cyclohexene on Pt(lll), 
Pt(223),844 
and Pt(100).833 
The studies on ethylene 
hydrogenation over Pt(ll1) have shown that the 
active catalytic surface in these processes is not clean, 
but completely covered with a layer of strongly bound 
hydrocarbon moieties (ethylidyne in the case of 
Zaera 
ethylene hydrogenation).681,682 
The role of these 
moieties in the hydrogenation mechanism is still 
controversial. The idea of ethylidyne being a direct 
intermediate in the conversion of ethylene to ethane 
was ruled out by kinetic measurements using 13C- 
and 14C-labeled 
compounds, which proved that eth- 
ylidyne hydrogenates at a rate several orders of 
magnitude slower than ethylene.651,880 
The ethyli- 
dyne layer does completely cover the surface of the 
catalyst during the reaction under certain conditions, 
impeding the adsorption of additional ethylene di- 
rectly on the metal, but it does not affect the kinetics 
of the ethylene hydrogenation, since reactions on 
clean and ethylidyne-presaturated surfaces display 
identical rates, and since the catalyst does not 
deactivate over time.681 
These observations 
led to the 
initial suggestion that ethylidyne may serve the 
double role of passivating the metal, preventing the 
fragmentation of adsorbed ethylene molecules and 
acting as a transfer agent for atomic hydrogen from 
the surface to the alkene.586 
It is logical to think that the same clean metal 
surface capable of dehydrogenating ethylene to eth- 
ylidyne cannot be responsible for catalyzing a mild 
reaction such as olefin hydrogenation. Indeed, the 
molecular desorption 
of ethylene under vacuum never 
exceeds 20%, and it only happens at coverages close 
to saturation; complete decomposition takes place at 
lower coverages. Furthermore, of the 20% of the 
ethylene that does desorb molecularly, only ap- 
proximately 5% originates from a weak state similar 
to that expected to exist under atmospheric pres- 
s u r e  .     
With respect to the idea of ethylidyne acting 
as a hydrogen transfer agent, this is supported by 
the fact that ethylidyne is capable of undergoing 
H-D exchange at the methyl group (at 
low coverages 
only under vacuum, but even at saturation under 
atmospheric pressures). However, since the ex- 
change is several orders of magnitude slower than 
ethylene hydrogenation, the 
,
8
 hydrogens can be ruled 
out as hydrogenating agents, and therefore, if eth- 
ylidyne were to facilitate the catalytic hydrogenation 
of ethylene, it would need to undergo an intercon- 
version with another surface species. On the basis 
of these ideas an equilibrium between ethylidyne 
(CCH3) and ethylidene (CHCH3) 
was originally pro- 
posed,681 
but this hypothesis has not yet been ad- 
equately tested. 
Alternatively, ethylidyne could merely be a specta- 
tor species present on the surface during ethylene 
hydrogenation, which could still take place via the 
same stepwise mechanism as under vacuum, either 
on defects or on the platinum sites opened by the 
removal of ethylidyne. The fact that the activation 
energy for ethylene hydrogenation is about the same 
under vacuum and in catalytic conditions support 
this hypothesis.586 Also, no ethylidyne buildup is 
seen on Pd-supported catalysts under certain condi- 
tions.880 
The absolute rates for olefin hydrogenation 
are much higher at high pressures than under 
vacuum, but the reaction probabilities per alkene 
molecule impinging on the surface are not: for 
ethylene that probability is about 2 x 
at 300 K 
under vacuum, but only 4 
x 
at high pressures. 
If the same mechanism is operative in both pressure

regimes, therefore, the catalytic reaction must take 
place on specific bare metal sites amounting to less 
than 0.001% of the total surface atoms, and such low 
concentrations of surface sites are difficult to detect 
with the surfam sensitive equipment available nowa- 
days. More work is needed to distinguish between 
these two mechanistic 
3. I+D Exchange 
The catalytic exchange of hydrogens for deuteriums 
in hydrocarbon molecules over single-crystal metals 
has so far only been studied for a few alkanes on 
platinum single-crystal surfaces.674s43ss1ssz 
The ki- 
netic parameters for ethane H-D exchange on 
Pt(lll), 
namely, the activation energy and the pres- 
sure dependence of the rate law, were found to be 
the same as for polycrystalline foils and supported 
catalysts. One of the most interesting results from 
the single-crystal studies is that the product distribu- 
tion displays an U-shape with maxima at the mono 
and perdeuterated alkanes. Since Pt(ll1) 
surfaces 
are smooth, there is no reason to believe that there 
is more than one type of site available for the 
reaction, and therefore the bimodal product distribu- 
tion seen in these studies strongly argues for a 
mechanism where the formation of a common initial 
intermediate, 
presumably 
an alkyl moiety, is followed 
by two competitive reaction paths. The monodeu- 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 8 2683 
terated product can be easily accounted for by the 
immediate reductive elimination of the alkyl groups 
by surface deuterium. The production of a large 
amount of fully deuterated alkane, on the other hand, 
requires at least two more surface intermediates. 
Recent N M R  
and high-resolution mass spectrometric 
analysis of the ethane products after exchange on 
polycrystalline samples suggests that one of those 
intermediates is the adsorbed olefin (Figure 19);883*m 
this is, in fact, to be expected given the ease with 
which 8-hydride elimination occurs in alkyl frag- 
ments. The other intermediate has tentatively been 
identified by low-energy electron diffraction experi- 
ments as alkylidyne,882 
the product of thermal acti- 
vation of alkenes on clean Pt(ll1) 
surfaces. 
4. Hydrogenolysis, lsomefization, and Cyclization 
Alkane hydrogenolysis has perhaps been the most 
studied reaction on single crystals under catalytic 
conditions. Ethane hydrogenolysis has been charac- 
terized on Ni(100) and Ni(lll),885 
Pt(lll),Sszss6887 
11011) 
and Ir(110)-(12),8 
Ru(OOO1) and Ru(l,l,- 
10),Sss 
Re(OOOl),687 
and W(100),890 
as well as 
on a few 
alloys. The activation energy for this reaction ranges 
from about 18 to 50 kcaymol, much higher than that 
for hydrogenation-dehydrogenation processes be- 
cause higher energies are required to break C-C 
than C-H bonds. This observation has led to the 
proposal of several mechanisms where dehydroge- 
nation steps 
precede the breaking 
of the hydrocarbon 
chain; the breaking of the C-C bond most likely 
occurs only in highly dehydrogenated surface species. 
In addition, the majority of the hydrogenolysis reac- 
tions are structure sensitive, being faster on open 
surfaces, and take place in the presence of a carbon- 
aceous layer on the surface of the catalyst. Studies 
on the hydrogenolysis of propane, butane, neopen- 
tane, n-hexane, n-heptane, cyclopropane, methylcy- 
clopropane, methylcyclopentane, and cyclohexane 
have provided additional mechanistic information for 
this reaction.683 For instance, 
the selectivity 
between 
2- and 3-methylpentane production by methylcyclo- 
pentane ring opening reflects the relative importance 
of selective and nonselective C-C bond-breaking 
steps d i r e  t l y .         
Due to the limitations of the 
experimental techniques available at the present 
time for such studies, however, data on in situ 
identification of intermediates during catalytic reac- 
tions by spectroscopic means are scarce. 
Many hydrogenolysis studies include data on the 
competing isomerization and/or cyclization reac- 
t i o n  .    
Skeletal rearrangements are usually fa- 
vored over hydrogenolysis reacti0ns.8 
Cyclization 
steps to aliphatic and aromatic compounds 
are also 
observed for chains with five or more carbon atoms. 
The conversion of n-hexane over platinum surfaces, 
for instance, yields significant quantities of methyl 
cyclopentane and benzene, and the isomerization to 
methyl pentanes in this system also proceeds via the 
formation of a Cg 
Once again, direct informa- 
tion on the surface intermediates is not available. 
5. Other C C  
Bond-Forming Reactions 
An interesting reaction involving C-C bond-forma- 
tion steps is the cyclotrimerization of acetylene over

analysis of the ethane product 
distribution obtained after H-D exchange between normal 
ethane and deuterium over a platinum foil.*@ 
The product 
distribution from these experiments is U-shaped, with 
maxima at the DI- and De-ethanes. 
The production of the 
single-exchanged 
ethane is explained by an ethane oxida- 
tive addition to 
the surface to produce ethyl moieties on 
the surface followed by the reductive elimination of that 
ethyl with surface deuterium. The formation of such large 
quantities of perdeuterioethane, however, requires the 
formation of at least two other intermediates on the 
surface. Since the NMR data show that CH2DCH2D 
is 
produced preferentially 
over CHsCHDz, it is reasonable to 
propose ethylene as a second intermediate. This can in fact 
be easily understood given the ease 
with which alkyl groups 
decompose via fi-hydride elimination steps. Additional low- 
energy electron diffraction 
results on Pt(ll1) 
suggest that 
ethylidyne could he the third surface species in this 
mechanism.sR2

This reaction is surface sen- 
sitive, being about five times faster on Pd(ll1) 
than 
on Pd(ll0). Also, it appears as if the high-pressure 
reaction takes place via the formation of a C
4
 
intermediate on the bare metal, the same as under 
vacuum.791 
However, since acetylene trimerization 
competes with its conversion to vinylidene, the rate 
for benzene formation under catalytic conditions is 
possibly limited by the availability of surface sites, 
as is the case in olefin hydrogenations. 
Another type of reaction involving C-C bond- 
formation steps is the Fischer-Tropsch process. Un- 
fortunately, the conversion of CO-hydrogen gas 
mixtures to hydrocarbons on single-crystal metal 
surfaces has only been studied in detail on nickel 
substrates, where the main reaction product is 
methane.894 
The initial rate-limiting step in that case 
is the dissociation 
of the C-0 bond, which is followed 
by the stepwise hydrogenation of the resulting car- 
bidic carbon. The fact that only methane is formed 
on these nickel surfaces indicates that hydrogen 
incorporation in all carbide, methylidyne, methylene, 
and methyl intermediates is much faster than C-C 
coupling or methylene insertion reactions. Methane 
is also the main CO hydrogenation product on other 
surfaces, but longer chain hydrocgbons do form on 
Co(OOOl), Co(1120) and C 0 ( l O l 2 ) ,     
Rh(lll),896 
Fe(lll),897 
and M O (  O O ) .     
As in the case of nickel, 
the relative selectivity between chain growth and 
chain termination (alkane formation) in these cases 
depends on the relative rates of the reductive elimi- 
nation and methylene migratory insertion steps. 
Finally, propylene can also undergo a metathesis 
reaction on either Mo(100) or molybdenum foils to 
yield ethylene and butene.791 
V. Conclusions 
Throughout this review we have attempted to 
systematically survey the present knowledge on both 
the structure and the thermal chemistry of hydro- 
carbon moieties on surfaces. In particular, analogies 
have been drawn, when possible, between surface 
and organometallic systems. Many examples were 
indeed found for this. In terms of the structure of 
the adsorbed hydrocarbons, 
for instance, single a-bond- 
ed species such as alkyls, alkenyls, aryls, and acetyl- 
ides, multiple a-bonded moieties such as alkylidenes, 
alkylidynes, vinylidenes, and metallacycles, and 
n-bonded molecules such as alkenes, alkynes, dienes, 
allyls, and arenes, have all been seen both in orga- 
nometallic complexes and on metal surfaces. With 
respect to reactivity, examples of these similarities 
were seen in the conversion of alkyl groups to olefins 
by /3-hydride elimination and in their reduction with 
hydrogen or other alkyl moieties to yield alkanes. 
As already mentioned in the introduction, the 
similarities in chemical behavior between hydrocar- 
bon ligands in organometallic complexes and hydro- 
carbon species adsorbed on surfaces can be justified 
by the localized nature of the chemical bond between 
the metal atoms and the hydrocarbon moieties on 
surfaces. There are, however, some differences be- 
tween these two types of systems worth discussing 
in some detail. For example, the C-H bonds in 
unsaturated adsorbates such as olefins are easier to 
activate on surfaces than on discrete metal com- 
plexes. The conversion of adsorbed neopentyl groups 
to isobutene is also difficult to explain in terms of 
known organometallic processes. C-C coupling and 
methylene and olefin migratory insertion reactions 
are apparently easier with coordinated ligands than 
with chemisorbed fragments on solid surfaces, at 
least under vacuum. Finally, heterogeneous systems 
catalyze a much larger number of reactions than 
their organometallic counterparts, but they usually 
exhibit much poorer selectivity toward any given 
pathway. These differences can be addressed by 
elaborating on the initial model for surface bonding 
discussed above, since several parameters need to be 
considered in order to fine-tune the description of the 
hydrocarbon-metal bonding. First of all, since the 
electronic structure of metals is quite complex, it 
cannot be simply divided into sp and d electronic 
bands, because those two bands do not only interact 
with each other but are also affected by the sur- 
rounding environment. For example, peripheral 
ligands do affect the chemistry of organometallic 
complexes. An extreme of this is the so called trans 
effect, by which a change in the nature of the ligand 
opposite to the hydrocarbon moiety being investi- 
gated modifies the strength of its metal-carbon bond. 
Another factor to consider in inorganic complexes is 
the formal oxidation state of the central metal atom- 
(s). These variations do not have direct parallels on 
surfaces, but the electronic structure of solids can be 
modified to some extent by the coadsorption of 
electron-donating or electron-withdrawing elements 
such as alkaline metals or halides, respectively, or 
by alloying two or more metals. Much research 
activity in the surface science community is nowa- 
days focused on the study of these effects. 
Differences in coordination geometry between sol- 
ids and organometallic compounds are important in 
the determination of hydrocarbon reactivity as well. 
Clearly, ligands are much less affected by steric 
hindrance in organometallic complexes than on sur- 
faces. This may be the reason why both reductive 
elimination and migratory insertion steps occur at a 
faster rate in metal complexes, especially if they 
involve two hydrocarbon moieties. On the other 
hand, coordination in organometallic systems is 
somewhat limited by the 18-electron-per-metal-atom 
rule that they need to obey; due to the delocalized 
nature of electrons in solids, the adherence to this 
rule on surfaces is less strict. Also, surfaces offer a 
wide variety of metal atom ensembles which are hard 
to emulate with discrete metal clusters; this differ- 
ence is critical in reactions such as dehydrogenation 
or skeletal rearrangements, which require large 
catalytic ensembles. Furthermore, the spatial ori- 
entation of the metal atomic orbitals in surfaces is 
fured by the structure of the bulk, so they are exposed 
in different orientations depending on the crystal- 
lographic plane of the chosen surface. This effect 
constitutes a major reason for the structure sensitiv- 
ity observed in many catalytic reactions. Lastly, 
changes in surface coverage not only affect the 
relative rates of unimolecular and bimolecular reac- 
tions, but can also induce adsorbate-adsorbate in- 
teractions, and even modify the electronic character- 
Chemistry of Hydrocarbon Moieties 
istics of the surface; high surface coverages usually 
lead to appreciable changes in both adsorption ener- 
gies and reaction rates. More research is needed in 
order to learn to exploit these differences. 
Research on the chemistry of hydrocarbons on 
surfaces is still in its infancy, and much work is 
needed to obtain a complete understanding of the 
parameters that control the structure and reactivity 
in those systems. For one, systematic studies are 
required on the chemisorption and conversion of 
moieties on different crystallographic orientations of 
the same metal and on different metals across the 
periodic table in order to establish reactivity trends. 
In fact, although this point was not emphasized 
throughout our review, a few of those systematic 
variations have already been identified. The relative 
selectivity between C-C coupling and hydride elimi- 
nation in alkyl groups for instance, increases from 
left to right in the periodic table d series: ,&hydride 
elimination dominates the chemistry of those alkyl 
species on platinum and nickel surfaces, but competi- 
tion with coupling reactions take place on copper and 
gold, and exclusive C-C bond formation occurs on 
silver. Both the identification of other trends and the 
explanation of the ones already reported await the 
gathering of more experimental results. 
Inorganic chemists can also help in the under- 
standing of surface systems and in connecting the 
knowledge from discrete molecules to solids. In 
particular, more work is needed in the area of cluster 
chemistry in order to be able to design compounds 
with a given metallic core and to study the reactivity 
of ligands on those frames. Systematic studies as a 
function of variables such as size, structure, and 
coordination numbers can greatly enhance our un- 
derstanding of the changes in hydrocarbon chemistry 
that occur in going from single atoms to solid 
surfaces. Finally, more refined structural and dy- 
namic theoretical studies can help in deciding on the 
relative stability of closely related chemisorbed spe- 
cies and can aid in determining what other param- 
eters control the selectivity among reactions with 
comparable activation energies. The payoff of all this 
will be an increased understanding of the many 
processes that involve surface reactivity. This, of 
course, includes heterogeneous catalysis, but also 
encompasses a range of other technologies, from 
tribology to electrochemistry and chemical vapor 
deposition. A better understanding of the surface 
chemistry in those systems will in turn result in the 
potential for designing new and better processes, not 
merely by trial and error, but in a systematic and 
knowledgeable way.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
