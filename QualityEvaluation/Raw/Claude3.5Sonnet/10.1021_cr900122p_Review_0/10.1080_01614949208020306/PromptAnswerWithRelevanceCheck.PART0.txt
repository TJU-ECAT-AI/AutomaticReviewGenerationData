<questions>

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain detailed information about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The document appears to focus on the conversion of lower alkanes to aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly those containing gallium and zinc. While it mentions a section on the mechanism of alkane activation, it does not provide specific details about the processes asked in the question.

提供的文献中没有包含关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进异相催化中C-H键活化的详细信息,也没有涉及Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提等机制,或者烷烃工业选择性氧化(如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐)的应用。该文档似乎主要关注低级烷烃在ZSM-5沸石(特别是含镓和锌的沸石)上转化为芳烃的过程。虽然文中提到了一个关于烷烃活化机理的章节,但并没有提供问题中所询问的具体过程的详细信息。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide specific information about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes to maleic anhydride. The document focuses on the transformation of lower alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly those containing gallium and zinc. While it mentions alkane activation mechanisms, it does not go into detail about the specific processes asked in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered using only the information provided in this literature.

给定的文献没有提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进异相催化中C-H键活化的具体信息，也没有涉及Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提等机制，或烷烃工业选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的内容。该文档主要关注ZSM-5沸石（特别是含镓和锌的沸石）对低级烷烃向芳烃转化的研究。虽然文中提到了烷烃活化机制，但并未详细讨论问题中提到的特定过程。因此，仅凭这篇文献中提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。

[1] "The mechanism of alkane activation by Ga- and Zn-loaded ZSM-5 zeolites is not well understood."

[2] "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of alkanes by Ga- and Zn-containing zeolites. In the case of Ga-ZSM-5, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism has been proposed."

[3] "In the case of Zn-ZSM-5, the formation of [Zn-H]+ species and subsequent H-abstraction from alkanes has been suggested."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides limited information on isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. It mentions that the mechanism of alkane activation by Ga- and Zn-loaded ZSM-5 zeolites is not well understood. For Ga-ZSM-5, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism has been proposed. For Zn-ZSM-5, the formation of [Zn-H]+ species and subsequent H-abstraction from alkanes is suggested. 

The document does not discuss the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane conversion to maleic anhydride. The information provided is limited to alkane activation mechanisms in Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolites, which are used for aromatization reactions rather than selective oxidation.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

该文献对于孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化提供了有限的信息。它提到Ga和Zn负载的ZSM-5沸石的烷烃活化机理尚不清楚。对于Ga-ZSM-5,提出了Mars-van Krevelen机理。对于Zn-ZSM-5,则建议形成[Zn-H]+物种并随后从烷烃中提取H。

该文档没有讨论工业选择性烷烃氧化或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。提供的信息仅限于Ga和Zn改性ZSM-5沸石中的烷烃活化机理,这些沸石用于芳构化反应而不是选择性氧化。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain specific information about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction, or the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes to produce maleic anhydride from butane. The document appears to focus on the conversion of lower alkanes to aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolites, which is a different process. Without more relevant information, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given text.

所提供的文献并未包含关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进异相催化中C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提等机制,或工业选择性氧化烷烃生产顺丁烯二酸酐的具体信息。该文档似乎主要集中在ZSM-5分子筛上低级烷烃转化为芳烃的过程,这是一个不同的过程。由于缺乏更多相关信息,仅基于给定的文本无法充分回答这个问题。
