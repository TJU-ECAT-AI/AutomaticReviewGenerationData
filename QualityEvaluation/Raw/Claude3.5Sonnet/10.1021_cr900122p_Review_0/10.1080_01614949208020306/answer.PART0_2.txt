The literature provides limited information on isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. It mentions that the mechanism of alkane activation by Ga- and Zn-loaded ZSM-5 zeolites is not well understood. For Ga-ZSM-5, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism has been proposed. For Zn-ZSM-5, the formation of [Zn-H]+ species and subsequent H-abstraction from alkanes is suggested. 

The document does not discuss the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane conversion to maleic anhydride. The information provided is limited to alkane activation mechanisms in Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolites, which are used for aromatization reactions rather than selective oxidation.

该文献对于孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化提供了有限的信息。它提到Ga和Zn负载的ZSM-5沸石的烷烃活化机理尚不清楚。对于Ga-ZSM-5,提出了Mars-van Krevelen机理。对于Zn-ZSM-5,则建议形成[Zn-H]+物种并随后从烷烃中提取H。

该文档没有讨论工业选择性烷烃氧化或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。提供的信息仅限于Ga和Zn改性ZSM-5沸石中的烷烃活化机理,这些沸石用于芳构化反应而不是选择性氧化。
