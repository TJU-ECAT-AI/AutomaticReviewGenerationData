[1] "A theoretical approach to the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides has been performed by means of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations."

[2] "Transition-state structures correspond to a four-center interaction with an energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol. This high activation barrier supports the heterolytic mechanism proposed for this reaction."

[3] "The products are methyl-metal compounds, CH3-Me (Me = Al, La), with the carbon atom negatively charged."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, nor does it discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or the industrial application of butane conversion to maleic anhydride. 

However, the literature does provide some insights into the activation of methane on Al and La oxide surfaces:

1. The study uses ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to examine the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides.

2. The reaction involves a heterolytic mechanism, supported by the high activation barrier of about 40 kcal/mol.

3. The transition state involves a four-center interaction.

4. The products of the reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La), with the carbon atom carrying a negative charge.

These findings suggest that the metal centers (Al and La) on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in methane through a heterolytic mechanism, forming methyl-metal intermediates. However, the study does not provide information on the specific industrial applications or other mechanisms mentioned in the question.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心促进C-H键活化的具体机制，也没有涉及Mars van Krevelen机制、H-抽提或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的工业应用。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于甲烷在Al和La氧化物表面上活化的见解：

1. 该研究使用从头量子力学计算来研究Al和La氧化物上甲烷活化的速率决定步骤。

2. 反应涉及一个异裂机制，这一点由约40 kcal/mol的高活化能障所支持。

3. 过渡态涉及四中心相互作用。

4. 反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。

这些发现表明，氧化物表面上的金属中心（Al和La）可以通过异裂机制促进甲烷中C-H键的活化，形成甲基-金属中间体。然而，该研究并未提供问题中提到的具体工业应用或其他机制的信息。

The provided literature does not directly address how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, nor does it discuss the Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms. The document also does not mention the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

However, the literature does provide some relevant information about methane activation on Al and La oxide surfaces:

3. The products of the reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La) with the carbon atom negatively charged.

These findings suggest that the activation of methane on these oxide surfaces involves a heterolytic C-H bond cleavage mechanism, rather than a homolytic one. This information could be relevant to understanding C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, but it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about isolated metal centers, various mechanisms, or industrial applications.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论孤立金属中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化，也没有提到Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机制。文档中也没有提及烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于甲烷在Al和La氧化物表面活化的相关信息：

1. 该研究使用从头算量子力学计算来研究Al和La氧化物上甲烷活化的限速步骤。

2. 过渡态涉及四中心相互作用，能量障碍约为40 kcal/mol，这支持反应的异裂机制。

3. 反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。

这些发现表明，甲烷在这些氧化物表面上的活化涉及异裂C-H键断裂机制，而不是均裂机制。这些信息可能与理解多相催化中的C-H键活化有关，但它并不能全面回答关于孤立金属中心、各种机制或工业应用的问题。

It does not mention Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, nor does it discuss the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

2. 研究重点是CH4在Al(OH)3和La(OH)3分子上的异裂化学吸附。

3. 过渡态涉及四中心相互作用，能量势垒高达约40 kcal/mol，支持异裂机制。

4. 该反应的产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。

5. 研究人员使用点电荷和从头算模型势来模拟催化表面，以考虑晶格效应。

虽然这些发现有助于理解氧化物表面上的C-H键活化，但它们并未直接解答问题中提到的具体机制或工业应用。

The provided literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials or the industrial application of these principles in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does offer some insights into the chemisorption of methane on aluminum and lanthanum oxide surfaces.

The study focuses on the heterolytic chemisorption of methane on Al(OH)3 and La(OH)3 molecules, which can be considered as simplified models of oxide surfaces. The transition state for this process involves a four-center interaction with a high energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol. This high activation barrier supports a heterolytic mechanism for the reaction.

The products of this reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La) with a negatively charged carbon atom. This suggests that the metal centers play a role in activating the C-H bond by accepting electrons, leading to the formation of a metal-carbon bond.

While the study does not explicitly discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, the heterolytic chemisorption process described could be relevant to understanding how metal centers on oxide surfaces can activate C-H bonds in catalytic processes. However, the specific application to butane conversion to maleic anhydride is not addressed in this literature.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心活化C-H键的具体机制，也未涉及这些原理在丁烷选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用。然而，它确实提供了一些关于甲烷在铝和镧氧化物表面上化学吸附的见解。

该研究聚焦于甲烷在Al(OH)3和La(OH)3分子上的异裂化学吸附，这些可以被视为氧化物表面的简化模型。这一过程的过渡态涉及一个四中心相互作用，具有约40 kcal/mol的高能垒。这种高活化能支持了该反应的异裂机制。

反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。这表明金属中心通过接受电子在活化C-H键中发挥作用，导致形成金属-碳键。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机制，但所描述的异裂化学吸附过程可能与理解氧化物表面上的金属中心如何在催化过程中活化C-H键有关。然而，这篇文献并未涉及具体应用于丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。
