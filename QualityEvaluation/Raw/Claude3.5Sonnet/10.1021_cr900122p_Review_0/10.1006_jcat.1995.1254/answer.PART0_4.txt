[1] "A theoretical approach to the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides has been performed by means of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations."

[2] "Transition-state structures correspond to a four-center interaction with an energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol. This high activation barrier supports the heterolytic mechanism proposed for this reaction."

[3] "The products are methyl-metal compounds, CH3-Me (Me = Al, La), with the carbon atom negatively charged."

The provided literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, nor does it discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or the industrial application to butane conversion to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some insights into methane activation on Al and La oxide surfaces:

The study uses ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to investigate the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides. It finds that the transition state involves a four-center interaction with a high energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol, supporting a heterolytic mechanism for the reaction. The products of this reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La) with a negatively charged carbon atom.

While this information is relevant to understanding C-H bond activation on oxide surfaces, it does not fully address the broader scope of the question regarding various mechanisms and industrial applications.

提供的文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心活化C-H键的具体机制，也没有涉及Mars van Krevelen机制、H-抽取或将这些原理应用于丁烷转化为马来酸酐的工业过程。但是，它确实提供了一些关于甲烷在Al和La氧化物表面上活化的见解：

该研究使用从头计算量子力学方法来研究Al和La氧化物上甲烷活化的速率决定步骤。研究发现，过渡态涉及一个四中心相互作用，能量障碍约为40 kcal/mol，支持了该反应的异裂机制。反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。

虽然这些信息与理解氧化物表面上C-H键活化相关，但它并未全面回答关于各种机制和工业应用的更广泛问题。
