[1] "A theoretical approach to the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides has been performed by means of ab initio quantum mechanical calculations."

[2] "Transition-state structures correspond to a four-center interaction with an energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol. This high activation barrier supports the heterolytic mechanism proposed for this reaction."

[3] "The products are methyl-metal compounds, CH3-Me (Me = Al, La), with the carbon atom negatively charged."

The provided literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, nor does it discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or the industrial application of butane conversion to maleic anhydride. 

However, the literature does provide some insights into the activation of methane on Al and La oxide surfaces:

1. The study uses ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to examine the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides.

2. The reaction involves a heterolytic mechanism, supported by the high activation barrier of about 40 kcal/mol.

3. The transition state involves a four-center interaction.

4. The products of the reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La), with the carbon atom carrying a negative charge.

These findings suggest that the metal centers (Al and La) on oxide surfaces can facilitate C-H bond activation in methane through a heterolytic mechanism, forming methyl-metal intermediates. However, the study does not provide information on the specific industrial applications or other mechanisms mentioned in the question.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心促进C-H键活化的具体机制，也没有涉及Mars van Krevelen机制、H-抽提或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的工业应用。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于甲烷在Al和La氧化物表面上活化的见解：

1. 该研究使用从头量子力学计算来研究Al和La氧化物上甲烷活化的速率决定步骤。

2. 反应涉及一个异裂机制，这一点由约40 kcal/mol的高活化能障所支持。

3. 过渡态涉及四中心相互作用。

4. 反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。

这些发现表明，氧化物表面上的金属中心（Al和La）可以通过异裂机制促进甲烷中C-H键的活化，形成甲基-金属中间体。然而，该研究并未提供问题中提到的具体工业应用或其他机制的信息。
