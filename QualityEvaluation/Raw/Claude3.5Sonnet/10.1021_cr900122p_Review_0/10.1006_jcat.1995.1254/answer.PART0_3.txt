The provided literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials or the industrial application of these principles in the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does offer some insights into the chemisorption of methane on aluminum and lanthanum oxide surfaces.

The study focuses on the heterolytic chemisorption of methane on Al(OH)3 and La(OH)3 molecules, which can be considered as simplified models of oxide surfaces. The transition state for this process involves a four-center interaction with a high energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol. This high activation barrier supports a heterolytic mechanism for the reaction.

The products of this reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La) with a negatively charged carbon atom. This suggests that the metal centers play a role in activating the C-H bond by accepting electrons, leading to the formation of a metal-carbon bond.

While the study does not explicitly discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, the heterolytic chemisorption process described could be relevant to understanding how metal centers on oxide surfaces can activate C-H bonds in catalytic processes. However, the specific application to butane conversion to maleic anhydride is not addressed in this literature.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心活化C-H键的具体机制，也未涉及这些原理在丁烷选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用。然而，它确实提供了一些关于甲烷在铝和镧氧化物表面上化学吸附的见解。

该研究聚焦于甲烷在Al(OH)3和La(OH)3分子上的异裂化学吸附，这些可以被视为氧化物表面的简化模型。这一过程的过渡态涉及一个四中心相互作用，具有约40 kcal/mol的高能垒。这种高活化能支持了该反应的异裂机制。

反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。这表明金属中心通过接受电子在活化C-H键中发挥作用，导致形成金属-碳键。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机制，但所描述的异裂化学吸附过程可能与理解氧化物表面上的金属中心如何在催化过程中活化C-H键有关。然而，这篇文献并未涉及具体应用于丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。
