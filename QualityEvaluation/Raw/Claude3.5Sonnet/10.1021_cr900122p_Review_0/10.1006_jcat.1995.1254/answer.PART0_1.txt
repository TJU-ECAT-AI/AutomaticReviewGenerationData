The provided literature does not directly address how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, nor does it discuss the Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms. The document also does not mention the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

However, the literature does provide some relevant information about methane activation on Al and La oxide surfaces:

1. The study uses ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to examine the rate-determining step for methane activation on Al and La oxides.

2. The transition state involves a four-center interaction with a high energy barrier of about 40 kcal/mol, which supports a heterolytic mechanism for the reaction.

3. The products of the reaction are methyl-metal compounds (CH3-Me, where Me is Al or La) with the carbon atom negatively charged.

These findings suggest that the activation of methane on these oxide surfaces involves a heterolytic C-H bond cleavage mechanism, rather than a homolytic one. This information could be relevant to understanding C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, but it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about isolated metal centers, various mechanisms, or industrial applications.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论孤立金属中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化，也没有提到Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机制。文档中也没有提及烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于甲烷在Al和La氧化物表面活化的相关信息：

1. 该研究使用从头算量子力学计算来研究Al和La氧化物上甲烷活化的限速步骤。

2. 过渡态涉及四中心相互作用，能量障碍约为40 kcal/mol，这支持反应的异裂机制。

3. 反应产物是甲基-金属化合物（CH3-Me，其中Me为Al或La），碳原子带负电荷。

这些发现表明，甲烷在这些氧化物表面上的活化涉及异裂C-H键断裂机制，而不是均裂机制。这些信息可能与理解多相催化中的C-H键活化有关，但它并不能全面回答关于孤立金属中心、各种机制或工业应用的问题。
