[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers a potentially attractive means for the production of alkenes."

[2] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[3] "A series of catalysts ranging in V2O5 weight loading from 1% to 15% were prepared and then characterized by X-ray absorption, Raman spectroscopy, UVvisible absorption spectroscopy, and EXAFS."

[4] "Figure 6 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials or the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. However, it does discuss some relevant concepts in heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is mentioned as a potential route for alkene production. This likely involves C-H bond activation, though the specific mechanism is not detailed.

2. For supported metal oxide catalysts, the basicity of the support affects olefin selectivity during alkane conversion. This suggests the support material plays a role in the catalytic process.

3. Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various materials were studied using multiple characterization techniques. This indicates the importance of understanding the structure and properties of supported metal centers.

4. The phosphorus to vanadium ratio in supported vanadium phosphate catalysts affects the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation from butane oxidation. This example demonstrates how catalyst composition can be tuned to improve selectivity in alkane oxidation reactions.

While the document provides some relevant information on heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, including the butane to maleic anhydride conversion, it does not go into depth on the specific C-H activation mechanisms or industrial applications requested in the question. More detailed information would be needed to fully address the query.

[1] "Importantly, 100% selectivity in catalytic reactions can only be achieved if there is a concerted research program initiated to produce catalysts by rational design with nanoscale control of the fabrication process."

[2] "To meet these objectives will require the following: (1) synthesis of model catalytic systems containing well-defined sites; (2) in situ studies involving a variety of spectroscopic techniques, designed to determine the nature of the active sites, active phases, and reaction;"

[3] "Carbon dioxide recovered from flue stacks or the atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells in an effort to mitigate atmospheric CO2 increases. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used for producing chemicals, fuels, and other useful products."

[4] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride using a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

The document does not provide detailed information specifically about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis or the mechanisms involved. However, it does mention some relevant concepts related to catalysis and selective oxidation of alkanes:

The document emphasizes the importance of rational catalyst design with nanoscale control to achieve 100% selectivity in catalytic reactions. It suggests that synthesizing model catalytic systems with well-defined sites and conducting in situ studies to determine the nature of active sites and phases are crucial for advancing catalysis research.

Regarding the selective oxidation of alkanes, the document provides an example of butane conversion to maleic anhydride using a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. This process utilizes a recirculating fluidized bed reactor system, where the catalyst is contacted with butane in a riser reactor and then reoxidized in a separate regeneration reactor. This approach achieves a 10-15% improvement in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to conventional fixed bed reactors using air, by operating in an anaerobic environment.

While the document does not explicitly discuss mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, it does highlight the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms and active sites for improving catalyst performance and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis.

该文档没有具体提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化或所涉及机制的详细信息。然而,它确实提到了一些与催化和烷烃选择性氧化相关的概念:

文档强调了通过纳米尺度控制进行理性催化剂设计的重要性,以实现催化反应100%的选择性。它建议合成具有明确定义位点的模型催化系统,并进行原位研究以确定活性位点和相的性质,这对推进催化研究至关重要。

关于烷烃的选择性氧化,文档提供了一个使用钒焦磷酸盐催化剂将丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的例子。这个过程利用了循环流化床反应器系统,其中催化剂在提升管反应器中与丁烷接触,然后在单独的再生反应器中重新氧化。与使用空气的常规固定床反应器相比,这种方法在无氧环境下操作,使顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性提高了10-15%。

虽然文档没有明确讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提等机制,但它确实强调了理解反应机理和活性位点对改善多相催化中催化剂性能和选择性的重要性。

[1] "Catalysts that facilitate carboxylation of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons are another important objective."

[2] "For example, direct hydrocarboxylation of butadiene to adipic acid or production of polyurethanes from carbamates (both derived from CO2) could be economically and environmentally attractive."

[3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is also known."

[4] "Better understanding is needed of the requirements for reducing CO2 beyond formate and CO in either a single or sequential steps."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific details about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis or the mechanisms involved. It also does not discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction in detail. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is mentioned briefly, but without elaboration on the catalytic process or principles involved. 

The document does suggest that developing catalysts for carboxylation of hydrocarbons is an important research objective. It also mentions that processes like direct hydrocarboxylation of butadiene to adipic acid could be economically and environmentally beneficial. However, the specific mechanisms and principles of C-H activation in these processes are not explained.

The literature indicates that more research is needed to understand the requirements for reducing CO2 beyond simple products like formate and CO, which may relate to the challenges of C-H activation and functionalization. Overall, while the document touches on some relevant topics, it does not provide sufficient detail to fully answer the question about C-H activation mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis or their industrial applications.

文献中没有提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化的具体细节,也没有讨论所涉及的机制。它也没有详细讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H抽提。文中简单提到了丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程,但没有详细说明催化过程或涉及的原理。

文件确实建议开发碳氢化合物羧基化催化剂是一个重要的研究目标。它还提到,像丁二烯直接羧基化生成己二酸这样的过程可能在经济和环境方面都有益处。然而,这些过程中C-H活化的具体机制和原理并没有得到解释。

文献指出,需要更多研究来了解将CO2还原到甲酸盐和CO等简单产物以外的要求,这可能与C-H活化和官能化的挑战有关。总的来说,虽然文件涉及了一些相关主题,但没有提供足够的细节来全面回答关于多相催化中C-H活化机制及其工业应用的问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the specific question about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The provided quotes do not discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or detailed principles of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. 

However, the document does mention that vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts are used commercially for the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This suggests that vanadium-based oxide catalysts play a role in activating C-H bonds of butane for this selective oxidation process, though the specific mechanisms are not described. The literature also indicates that coupling redox-active metal centers with polyoxometalates can improve activity and selectivity in metal-catalyzed oxidation processes, which may be relevant to alkane oxidation catalysis.

Overall, while the document touches on some aspects of heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, it lacks the detailed mechanistic discussion needed to fully address the question as posed.
