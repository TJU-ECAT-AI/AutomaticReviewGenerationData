[1] "Importantly, 100% selectivity in catalytic reactions can only be achieved if there is a concerted research program initiated to produce catalysts by rational design with nanoscale control of the fabrication process."

[2] "To meet these objectives will require the following: (1) synthesis of model catalytic systems containing well-defined sites; (2) in situ studies involving a variety of spectroscopic techniques, designed to determine the nature of the active sites, active phases, and reaction;"

[3] "Carbon dioxide recovered from flue stacks or the atmosphere can be sequestered in oceans or spent gas and oil wells in an effort to mitigate atmospheric CO2 increases. Alternatively, recovered CO2 can be used for producing chemicals, fuels, and other useful products."

[4] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride using a specially formulated vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst, is circulated from a riser reactor where it is contacted with butane to a fluidized regeneration reactor where it is then reoxidized. By this means, a maleic anhydride selectivity improvement of 1015% is achieved in an anerobic environment versus operation in a conventional fixed bed using air."

The document does not provide detailed information specifically about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis or the mechanisms involved. However, it does mention some relevant concepts related to catalysis and selective oxidation of alkanes:

The document emphasizes the importance of rational catalyst design with nanoscale control to achieve 100% selectivity in catalytic reactions. It suggests that synthesizing model catalytic systems with well-defined sites and conducting in situ studies to determine the nature of active sites and phases are crucial for advancing catalysis research.

Regarding the selective oxidation of alkanes, the document provides an example of butane conversion to maleic anhydride using a vanadium pyrophosphate catalyst. This process utilizes a recirculating fluidized bed reactor system, where the catalyst is contacted with butane in a riser reactor and then reoxidized in a separate regeneration reactor. This approach achieves a 10-15% improvement in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to conventional fixed bed reactors using air, by operating in an anaerobic environment.

While the document does not explicitly discuss mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, it does highlight the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms and active sites for improving catalyst performance and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis.

该文档没有具体提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化或所涉及机制的详细信息。然而,它确实提到了一些与催化和烷烃选择性氧化相关的概念:

文档强调了通过纳米尺度控制进行理性催化剂设计的重要性,以实现催化反应100%的选择性。它建议合成具有明确定义位点的模型催化系统,并进行原位研究以确定活性位点和相的性质,这对推进催化研究至关重要。

关于烷烃的选择性氧化,文档提供了一个使用钒焦磷酸盐催化剂将丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的例子。这个过程利用了循环流化床反应器系统,其中催化剂在提升管反应器中与丁烷接触,然后在单独的再生反应器中重新氧化。与使用空气的常规固定床反应器相比,这种方法在无氧环境下操作,使顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性提高了10-15%。

虽然文档没有明确讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提等机制,但它确实强调了理解反应机理和活性位点对改善多相催化中催化剂性能和选择性的重要性。
