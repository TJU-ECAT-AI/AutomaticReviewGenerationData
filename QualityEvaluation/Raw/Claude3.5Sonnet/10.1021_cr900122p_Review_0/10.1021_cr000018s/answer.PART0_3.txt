[1] "Catalysts that facilitate carboxylation of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons are another important objective."

[2] "For example, direct hydrocarboxylation of butadiene to adipic acid or production of polyurethanes from carbamates (both derived from CO2) could be economically and environmentally attractive."

[3] "The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is also known."

[4] "Better understanding is needed of the requirements for reducing CO2 beyond formate and CO in either a single or sequential steps."

The literature does not provide specific details about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis or the mechanisms involved. It also does not discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or H-abstraction in detail. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is mentioned briefly, but without elaboration on the catalytic process or principles involved. 

The document does suggest that developing catalysts for carboxylation of hydrocarbons is an important research objective. It also mentions that processes like direct hydrocarboxylation of butadiene to adipic acid could be economically and environmentally beneficial. However, the specific mechanisms and principles of C-H activation in these processes are not explained.

The literature indicates that more research is needed to understand the requirements for reducing CO2 beyond simple products like formate and CO, which may relate to the challenges of C-H activation and functionalization. Overall, while the document touches on some relevant topics, it does not provide sufficient detail to fully answer the question about C-H activation mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis or their industrial applications.

文献中没有提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化的具体细节,也没有讨论所涉及的机制。它也没有详细讨论Mars van Krevelen机制或H抽提。文中简单提到了丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程,但没有详细说明催化过程或涉及的原理。

文件确实建议开发碳氢化合物羧基化催化剂是一个重要的研究目标。它还提到,像丁二烯直接羧基化生成己二酸这样的过程可能在经济和环境方面都有益处。然而,这些过程中C-H活化的具体机制和原理并没有得到解释。

文献指出,需要更多研究来了解将CO2还原到甲酸盐和CO等简单产物以外的要求,这可能与C-H活化和官能化的挑战有关。总的来说,虽然文件涉及了一些相关主题,但没有提供足够的细节来全面回答关于多相催化中C-H活化机制及其工业应用的问题。
