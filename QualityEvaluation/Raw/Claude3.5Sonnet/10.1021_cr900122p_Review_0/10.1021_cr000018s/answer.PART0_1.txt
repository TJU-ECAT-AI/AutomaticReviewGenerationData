The literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials or the Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction processes. However, it does discuss some relevant concepts in heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is mentioned as a potential route for alkene production. This likely involves C-H bond activation, though the specific mechanism is not detailed.

2. For supported metal oxide catalysts, the basicity of the support affects olefin selectivity during alkane conversion. This suggests the support material plays a role in the catalytic process.

3. Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various materials were studied using multiple characterization techniques. This indicates the importance of understanding the structure and properties of supported metal centers.

4. The phosphorus to vanadium ratio in supported vanadium phosphate catalysts affects the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation from butane oxidation. This example demonstrates how catalyst composition can be tuned to improve selectivity in alkane oxidation reactions.

While the document provides some relevant information on heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, including the butane to maleic anhydride conversion, it does not go into depth on the specific C-H activation mechanisms or industrial applications requested in the question. More detailed information would be needed to fully address the query.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心活化C-H键的具体机理，或Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提过程。然而，它确实讨论了烷烃氧化过程中一些相关的多相催化概念：

1. 提到了烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)是生产烯烃的潜在途径。这可能涉及C-H键活化，但没有详细说明具体机理。

2. 对于负载型金属氧化物催化剂，载体的碱性影响烷烃转化过程中的烯烃选择性。这表明载体材料在催化过程中起着重要作用。

3. 使用多种表征技术研究了负载在各种材料上的钒氧化物催化剂。这表明了解负载金属中心的结构和性质的重要性。

4. 在负载型钒磷酸盐催化剂中，磷与钒的比例影响丁烷氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性。这个例子展示了如何通过调整催化剂组成来提高烷烃氧化反应的选择性。

虽然该文档提供了一些关于烷烃氧化多相催化的相关信息，包括丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的例子，但它并未深入探讨问题中要求的具体C-H活化机理或工业应用。需要更详细的信息才能全面回答这个问题。
