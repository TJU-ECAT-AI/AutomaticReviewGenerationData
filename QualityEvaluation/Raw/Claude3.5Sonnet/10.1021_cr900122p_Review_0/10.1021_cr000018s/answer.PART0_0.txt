[1] "Under oxidative conditions, CO2 may react with olefins to afford cyclic carbonates that find wide industrial applications."

[2] "Fischer and Bell studied Cu/ZrO2/SiO2 catalysts by in-situ infrared spectroscopy and suggested the pathway shown in Scheme 7 for the route to methanol."

[3] "Hickman and Schmidt made substantial progress in understanding mechanistically the very difficult partial oxidation of methane using noble-metal-coated monoliths with very short reaction contact times"

[4] "Current reformers are heat-transfer-limited rather than catalyst-limited and are loaded with large excesses of catalyst because of the space velocities utilized. Better methods for the transfer of heat into the reactor, including novel catalyst shapes, are needed to impact overall yield and process performance."
