The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the specific question about isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The provided quotes do not discuss the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, H-abstraction, or detailed principles of industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. 

However, the document does mention that vanadium pyrophosphate catalysts are used commercially for the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. This suggests that vanadium-based oxide catalysts play a role in activating C-H bonds of butane for this selective oxidation process, though the specific mechanisms are not described. The literature also indicates that coupling redox-active metal centers with polyoxometalates can improve activity and selectivity in metal-catalyzed oxidation processes, which may be relevant to alkane oxidation catalysis.

Overall, while the document touches on some aspects of heterogeneous catalysis for alkane oxidation, it lacks the detailed mechanistic discussion needed to fully address the question as posed.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化的具体问题。所提供的引文没有讨论Mars van Krevelen机制、H-抽提或烷烃工业选择性氧化的详细原理。

然而，文献确实提到商业上使用特制的钒焦磷酸盐催化剂将丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐。这表明钒基氧化物催化剂在这种选择性氧化过程中对丁烷C-H键的活化起作用，尽管没有描述具体机制。文献还指出，将氧化还原活性金属中心与多金属氧酸盐结合可以提高金属催化氧化过程的活性和选择性，这可能与烷烃氧化催化有关。

总的来说，虽然文献涉及了烷烃氧化多相催化的一些方面，但缺乏详细的机理讨论，无法完全回答所提出的问题。
