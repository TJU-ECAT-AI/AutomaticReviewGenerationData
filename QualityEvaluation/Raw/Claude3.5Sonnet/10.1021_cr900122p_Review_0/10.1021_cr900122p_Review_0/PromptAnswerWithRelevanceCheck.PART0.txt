[1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "It is probable that CH bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates."

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Formation of organometallic intermediates: The isolated metal centers can interact with alkanes and aromatics to form organometallic species, which are key intermediates in the C-H activation process.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bonds can be activated through heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites, leading to the formation of surface metal-alkyl species.

3. H-abstraction: This mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen by reactive oxygen sites on the oxide surface, resulting in the formation of adsorbed alkyl radical intermediates.

The main mechanisms involved in these processes are:

1. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide, followed by the reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen. It is commonly observed in selective oxidation reactions.

2. H-abstraction: Surface oxygen species abstract hydrogen from the alkane, forming radical intermediates that undergo further transformations.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to achieve high selectivity and efficiency. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example:

1. The process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst, which provides isolated metal centers for C-H activation.

2. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.

3. The most accepted mechanism involves a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by V(IV)O species, converting butane into 2-butenes.

4. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

5. The process achieves high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion) and is commercially viable.

This example demonstrates how understanding and applying C-H activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers can lead to the development of efficient and selective industrial processes for the conversion of alkanes to valuable products.

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms. These include:

1. Formation of metal-alkyl intermediates: In H/D exchange processes, metal oxides catalyze C-H bond activation by forming metal-alkyl intermediates.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bond activation can occur through heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites, such as GaO-S in gallium oxide.

3. H-abstraction: This process involves the removal of a hydrogen atom by a reactive oxygen site on the oxide surface, leading to the formation of an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl.

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a common pathway in selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide catalyst, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced solid catalyst by molecular oxygen.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert simple hydrocarbons into more valuable oxygenated products. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of this application. This process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst and achieves high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion).

In the butane to maleic anhydride conversion:

1. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.
2. The most accepted mechanism involves the concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by VIV=O species, converting butane into 2-butenes.
3. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

This process demonstrates how understanding and controlling C-H bond activation on isolated metal centers can lead to highly selective and industrially valuable catalytic processes.
