[1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "H/D exchange processes in D2/alkane and CH4/CD4 mixtures are catalyzed by various metal oxides (MxOy), and in most cases they take place via CH bond activation and formation of a metal-alkyl intermediate"

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored"

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The direct and selective conversion of alkanes into oxygenates by oxidation with molecular oxygen has been a great challenge for decades. Note that high selectivities are usually achieved for very specific substrates, which yield very stable products, e.g. propane  acrylic acid, butane  maleic anhydride, xylene  phtalic anhydride...."

[6] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

[7] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms. These include:

1. Formation of metal-alkyl intermediates: In H/D exchange processes, metal oxides catalyze C-H bond activation by forming metal-alkyl intermediates.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bond activation can occur through heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites, such as GaO-S in gallium oxide.

3. H-abstraction: This process involves the removal of a hydrogen atom by a reactive oxygen site on the oxide surface, leading to the formation of an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl.

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is a common pathway in selective oxidation of alkanes. This mechanism involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide catalyst, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced solid catalyst by molecular oxygen.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert simple hydrocarbons into more valuable oxygenated products. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of this application. This process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst and achieves high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion).

In the butane to maleic anhydride conversion:

1. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.
2. The most accepted mechanism involves the concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms by VIV=O species, converting butane into 2-butenes.
3. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

This process demonstrates how understanding and controlling C-H bond activation on isolated metal centers can lead to highly selective and industrially valuable catalytic processes.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过各种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化。这些机制包括：

1. 形成金属-烷基中间体：在H/D交换过程中，金属氧化物通过形成金属-烷基中间体催化C-H键活化。

2. 异裂：C-H键活化可以通过在高度活性的金属-氧位点上进行异裂来实现，例如氧化镓中的GaO-S。

3. H-抽提：这个过程涉及氧化物表面上的活性氧位点移除氢原子，导致形成吸附的烷基自由基中间体和表面羟基。

Mars van Krevelen机制是烷烃选择性氧化的常见途径。这种机制涉及金属氧化物催化剂对烷烃的氧化，随后还原的固体催化剂被分子氧再氧化。

在工业烷烃选择性氧化中，这些原理被应用于将简单的烃类转化为更有价值的含氧产品。丁烷转化为马来酸酐是这种应用的一个典型例子。这个过程使用钒磷酸盐（VPO）作为催化剂，并实现了高选择性（在65%转化率下可达97%）。

在丁烷到马来酸酐的转化过程中：

1. 决定反应速率的步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化。
2. 最被接受的机制涉及VIV=O物种对两个氢原子的协同抽提，将丁烷转化为2-丁烯。
3. 随后是活性相被O2再氧化，符合Mars van Krevelen机制。

这个过程展示了如何通过理解和控制孤立金属中心上的C-H键活化，可以实现高选择性和工业上有价值的催化过程。
