[1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "It is probable that CH bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates."

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms, primarily involving the formation of organometallic species or intermediates. These processes can occur via heterolytic splitting on reactive metal-oxide sites or through H-abstraction on reactive oxygen sites, leading to the formation of adsorbed alkyl radical intermediates and surface hydroxyls.

Two main mechanisms involved in these processes are:

1. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide, followed by the reoxidation of the solid catalyst by molecular oxygen. This mechanism is common in selective oxidation reactions.

2. H-abstraction: Surface oxygen species abstract hydrogen from the alkane, forming radical intermediates that undergo further transformations.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert simple hydrocarbons into more valuable products. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example of this application. This process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) catalysts and achieves high selectivity (up to 97% at 65% conversion).

In the butane to maleic anhydride conversion:

1. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.
2. The most accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes through a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species.
3. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, following the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

This process demonstrates how understanding and controlling C-H bond activation on isolated metal centers can lead to highly selective and efficient industrial processes for the conversion of alkanes into more valuable products.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过各种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化，主要涉及有机金属物种或中间体的形成。这些过程可以通过在反应性金属-氧化物位点上的异裂或在反应性氧位点上的氢抽提发生，导致吸附的烷基自由基中间体和表面羟基的形成。

这些过程中涉及的两个主要机制是：

1. Mars van Krevelen机制：这涉及烷烃被金属氧化物氧化，随后固体催化剂被分子氧再氧化。这种机制在选择性氧化反应中很常见。

2. 氢抽提：表面氧物种从烷烃中抽取氢，形成经历进一步转化的自由基中间体。

在工业选择性烷烃氧化中，这些原理被应用于将简单烃类转化为更有价值的产品。丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐是这种应用的一个典型例子。这个过程使用钒磷酸盐（VPO）催化剂，并实现了高选择性（在65%转化率下高达97%）。

在丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程中：

1. 决定反应速率的步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化。
2. 最被接受的机制涉及通过在VIVO物种上协同抽取两个氢原子将丁烷转化为2-丁烯。
3. 随后是活性相被O2再氧化，遵循Mars van Krevelen机制。

这个过程展示了理解和控制孤立金属中心上的C-H键活化如何能够导致高选择性和高效的工业过程，将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品。
