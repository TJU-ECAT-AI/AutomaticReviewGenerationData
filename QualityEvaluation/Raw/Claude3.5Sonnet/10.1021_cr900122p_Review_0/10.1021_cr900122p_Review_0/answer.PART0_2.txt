[1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "It is probable that CH bond activation on other oxides takes place via similar processes and involves organometallic intermediates."

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored (Scheme 4)."

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species (Scheme 5b), (95, 96) which is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2 (the Mars van Krevelen mechanism)."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Formation of organometallic intermediates: Isolated metal centers can form organometallic species or intermediates upon C-H bond activation of alkanes and aromatics.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bond activation can occur via heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites, leading to the formation of surface metal-alkyl species.

3. H-abstraction: Another mechanism involves H-abstraction by reactive surface oxygen sites, resulting in adsorbed alkyl radical intermediates and surface hydroxyls.

The main mechanisms involved in these processes are:

1. Mars van Krevelen mechanism: This involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide, followed by the reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen.

2. H-abstraction: Surface oxygen species abstract hydrogen from the alkane, forming radical intermediates that undergo further transformations.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to achieve high selectivity and conversion rates. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride serves as a specific example:

1. The process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst, achieving high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion).

2. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.

3. The most accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane to 2-butenes through a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on V(IV)O species.

4. This is followed by the reoxidation of the active phase by O2, adhering to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism.

5. The process involves multiple steps, including the formation of butenes, butadiene, and 1,4-dihydrofuran, before finally yielding maleic anhydride.

This example demonstrates how understanding and applying C-H bond activation mechanisms on isolated metal centers can lead to efficient and selective industrial processes for the conversion of alkanes to valuable products.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 形成有机金属中间体：孤立金属中心可以在烷烃和芳烃的C-H键活化过程中形成有机金属物种或中间体。

2. 异裂：C-H键活化可以通过在高反应性金属-氧位点上的异裂发生，导致表面金属-烷基物种的形成。

3. H-抽提：另一种机制涉及反应性表面氧位点的H-抽提，产生吸附的烷基自由基中间体和表面羟基。

这些过程中涉及的主要机制是：

1. Mars van Krevelen机制：这涉及金属氧化物对烷烃的氧化，随后分子氧对固体的再氧化。

2. H-抽提：表面氧物种从烷烃中抽取氢，形成进一步转化的自由基中间体。

在工业烷烃选择性氧化中，这些原理被应用于实现高选择性和转化率。丁烷转化为顺丁烯酐作为具体例子：

1. 该过程使用钒磷酸盐（VPO）作为催化剂，实现高选择性（在65%转化率下高达97%）。

2. 决定反应速率的步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化。

3. 最被接受的机制涉及通过V(IV)O物种上两个氢原子的协同抽提将丁烷转化为2-丁烯。

4. 随后是O2对活性相的再氧化，符合Mars van Krevelen机制。

5. 该过程涉及多个步骤，包括形成丁烯、丁二烯和1,4-二氢呋喃，最终生成顺丁烯酐。

这个例子展示了如何理解和应用孤立金属中心上的C-H键活化机制，从而实现烷烃高效和选择性转化为有价值产品的工业过程。
