[1] "CH bond activation involving carbonium and carbenium ion intermediates (3, 25-27) or taking place on metal particles (supported or not) or clean metal surfaces (28-35) has been extensively reviewed in the past years. Here, we will focus on processes involving CH bond activation of alkanes and aromatics on isolated metal centers of surfaces on oxide materials leading to organometallic species and/or intermediates."

[2] "H/D exchange processes in D2/alkane and CH4/CD4 mixtures are catalyzed by various metal oxides (MxOy), and in most cases they take place via CH bond activation and formation of a metal-alkyl intermediate"

[3] "A detailed mechanistic investigation of the dehydrogenation process by periodic DFT calculations shows that the CH bond activation can take place via either heterolytic splitting on highly reactive GaOS or H-abstraction on a reactive OS site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl, with the latter process being slightly favored"

[4] "All selective oxidations of alkanes start by CH bond activation, which is often the rate-limiting step, and this key step is usually an H-abstraction by surface oxygen species yielding radical intermediates, which are further transformed into the products via multiple steps, and no evidence for metalalkyl intermediates has been found. It typically involves the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide and reoxidation of the solid by molecular oxygen."

[5] "The most noteworthy example of this series is probably the direct conversion of butane into maleic anhydride with high selectivities (up to 97% at 65% conversion), and it is in fact a commercial process. (14, 93) One of the best catalytic systems is based on vanadium phosphate (VPO), which is also used to convert selectively o-xylene into phtalic anhydride."

[6] "While the actual elementary steps of such a complicated process and the nature of the active sites are still matters of debates, the rate determining step is the CH bond activation of butane. The most commonly accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes via a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on VIVO species"

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through various mechanisms. These include:

1. Formation of metal-alkyl intermediates: Metal oxides can catalyze H/D exchange processes via C-H bond activation, forming metal-alkyl intermediates.

2. Heterolytic splitting: C-H bond activation can occur through heterolytic splitting on highly reactive metal-oxygen sites.

3. H-abstraction: This process involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom by a reactive oxygen site, leading to an adsorbed alkyl radical intermediate and a surface hydroxyl.

The Mars van Krevelen mechanism is commonly involved in these processes, particularly in selective oxidation reactions. This mechanism involves the oxidation of the alkane by the metal oxide, followed by the reoxidation of the solid catalyst by molecular oxygen.

In industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, these principles are applied to convert simple hydrocarbons into more valuable products. The conversion of butane to maleic anhydride is a prime example:

1. This process uses vanadium phosphate (VPO) as a catalyst.
2. The rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of butane.
3. The most accepted mechanism involves the conversion of butane into 2-butenes through a concerted abstraction of two hydrogen atoms on V(IV)O species.
4. This initial step is followed by multiple oxidation steps to ultimately form maleic anhydride.

This process demonstrates how understanding and controlling C-H bond activation on isolated metal centers can lead to highly selective and industrially important catalytic processes.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过各种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化。这些机制包括：

1. 形成金属-烷基中间体：金属氧化物可以通过C-H键活化催化H/D交换过程，形成金属-烷基中间体。

2. 异裂：C-H键活化可以通过高反应性金属-氧位点上的异裂发生。

3. H-抽提：这个过程涉及反应性氧位点对氢原子的抽提，导致吸附的烷基自由基中间体和表面羟基的形成。

Mars van Krevelen机制通常涉及这些过程，尤其是在选择性氧化反应中。这种机制涉及金属氧化物对烷烃的氧化，随后是分子氧对固体催化剂的再氧化。

在烷烃工业选择性氧化中，这些原理被应用于将简单烃类转化为更有价值的产品。丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐是一个典型的例子：

1. 这个过程使用钒磷酸盐（VPO）作为催化剂。
2. 速率决定步骤是丁烷的C-H键活化。
3. 最被接受的机制涉及通过V(IV)O物种上的协同两个氢原子抽提，将丁烷转化为2-丁烯。
4. 这个初始步骤之后是多个氧化步骤，最终形成顺丁烯二酐。

这个过程展示了理解和控制孤立金属中心上的C-H键活化如何可以导致高选择性和工业上重要的催化过程。
