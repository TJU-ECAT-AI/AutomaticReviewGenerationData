[2] "the role of the redox properties of the active sites for catalysts based on reducible metal oxides"

[3] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are: 1. The activation of oxygen and of the alkane"

[4] "Since these compounds lack bulk-O-insertion properties, they are not used when the reaction is aimed at the production of oxygenates."

[5] "In the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, the two essential requirements for catalysts of superior performance are: (i) a partial degree of reduction, and (ii) a cubic crystalline structure."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: Dispersed active sites prevent over-oxidation and improve selectivity.

2. Redox properties: The oxidation state of metal centers affects their ability to activate C-H bonds and insert oxygen.

3. Oxygen activation: Isolated sites can activate molecular oxygen to create reactive oxygen species.

4. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the oxide participates in the reaction, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst.

5. H-abstraction: Metal centers can abstract hydrogen from alkanes to form alkyl radicals.

In the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are applied by using vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts with:

1. Partially reduced vanadium centers
2. A specific crystalline structure that isolates active sites
3. The ability to activate both butane and oxygen
4. Participation of lattice oxygen in the oxidation process
5. Control of the catalyst's redox properties to balance activity and selectivity

This allows for selective oxidation of butane while minimizing complete combustion to CO2.

在多相催化中,氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进C-H键的活化:

1. 位点隔离:分散的活性位点防止过度氧化并提高选择性。

2. 氧化还原性质:金属中心的氧化态影响其活化C-H键和插入氧的能力。

3. 氧气活化:孤立位点可以活化分子氧以产生活性氧物种。

4. Mars-van Krevelen机理:氧化物中的晶格氧参与反应,随后催化剂被重新氧化。

5. H原子抽提:金属中心可以从烷烃中抽提氢原子形成烷基自由基。

在工业上将丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程中,通过使用具有以下特性的钒酰焦磷酸盐催化剂应用了这些原理:

1. 部分还原的钒中心
2. 能隔离活性位点的特定晶体结构 
3. 能够同时活化丁烷和氧气
4. 晶格氧参与氧化过程
5. 控制催化剂的氧化还原性质以平衡活性和选择性

这允许选择性地氧化丁烷,同时最大限度地减少完全燃烧为CO2。
