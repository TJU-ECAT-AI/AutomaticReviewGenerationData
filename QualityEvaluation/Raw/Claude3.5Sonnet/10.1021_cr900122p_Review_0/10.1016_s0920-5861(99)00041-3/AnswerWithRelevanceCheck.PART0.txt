          "the site isolation theory, developed many years ago by Callahan and Grasselli [23], which claims the importance of having a statistically controlled number of surface oxidizing sites in order to favor selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions."

"the mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity)"

"The role of structural defects in favoring the mobility of ionic species in the bulk [13];"

"the redox properties of the metal in transition metal oxide-based catalysts, in terms of reducibility and reoxidizability of the active sites, and the metaloxygen bond strength [3,5];"

"It is well known that the oxidation state of transition metal ions which constitute the active component of mixed oxide-based catalysts is a function of the operating conditions for the reaction, since the surface of the catalyst is in dynamic interaction with the gas phase [2,21]."

"In the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride over VPO catalysts, the contribution of homogeneous radical processes has also been postulated to play a fundamental role [168,169]."

"Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are: [...] 1.1. the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,7,11];"

"Particular cases, which can be considered as intermediates between completely heterogeneous mechanisms and homogeneous reactions are those reactions which, even though they occur on redox-type catalytic systems, include a rst step which occurs in the gas phase."

"The oxidation of n-butane and n-pentane over vanadyl pyrophosphate [...] In general, the fundamental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 as the active phase is recognized but it is generally believed that oxidized V5+ sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride."

"Since these compounds lack bulk-O-insertion properties, they are not used when the reaction is aimed at the production of oxygenates."

"In the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, the two essential requirements for catalysts of superior performance are: (i) a partial degree of reduction, and (ii) a cubic crystalline structure."

"The oxygen species which are involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species [9497]."

          Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: The density and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface is crucial. Isolated metal centers provide specific adsorption sites for reactants and control the selectivity of the reaction, favoring selective oxidation over combustion.

2. Redox properties: The oxidation state of transition metal ions in the catalyst is dynamic and interacts with the gas phase. This allows for controlled oxidation and reduction cycles. The reducibility and re-oxidizability of the active sites, as well as the metal-oxygen bond strength, play key roles in C-H activation.

3. Oxygen species: Both adsorbed oxygen species and lattice oxygen (bulk oxygen ions) on the isolated metal centers play crucial roles in C-H bond activation and subsequent oxidation steps.

4. Heterogeneous mechanism: The reaction typically involves the formation of intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species on the catalyst surface, occurring preferentially at lower temperatures.

5. Structural effects: Defects in the catalyst structure can favor the mobility of ionic species in the bulk, potentially aiding C-H activation.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and H-abstraction are involved in these processes:

1. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the oxide participates in the reaction, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst. This is particularly important for reactions aimed at producing oxygenates.

2. H-abstraction: Metal centers can abstract hydrogen from alkanes to form alkyl radicals.

In the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are applied using vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) catalysts:

1. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous radical processes play important roles.
2. Oxidized V5+ sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases or domains on (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in maleic anhydride formation.
3. A partial degree of reduction and a cubic crystalline structure are essential for superior catalyst performance.
4. Both bulk oxygen ions (limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species are involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane.
5. The reaction likely begins with C-H activation on the catalyst surface, followed by further reactions that may involve both surface and gas-phase steps.

This approach allows for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride while minimizing complete combustion to CO2. The catalyst's ability to provide oxygen for insertion into the hydrocarbon while maintaining selectivity is key to the reaction's success.

          氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 位点隔离：催化剂表面活性位点的密度和分布至关重要。孤立的金属中心为反应物提供特定的吸附位点，并控制反应的选择性，有利于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。

2. 氧化还原性质：催化剂中过渡金属离子的氧化态是动态的，并与气相相互作用。这允许控制氧化和还原循环。活性位点的可还原性和可再氧化性，以及金属-氧键强度在C-H活化中起关键作用。

3. 氧物种：孤立金属中心上的吸附氧物种和晶格氧（体相氧离子）在C-H键活化和随后的氧化步骤中起着至关重要的作用。

4. 多相机制：反应通常涉及在催化剂表面形成中间态烷氧基或烷基自由基物种，这种情况在较低温度下优先发生。

5. 结构效应：催化剂结构中的缺陷可以促进体相中离子物种的迁移，可能有助于C-H活化。

Mars-van Krevelen机理和H原子抽提参与这些过程：

1. Mars-van Krevelen机理：氧化物中的晶格氧参与反应，随后催化剂被重新氧化。这对于以生产含氧化合物为目标的反应特别重要。

2. H原子抽提：金属中心可以从烷烃中抽提氢原子形成烷基自由基。

在丁烷工业转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程中，使用钒焦磷酸盐（(VO)2P2O7）催化剂应用了这些原理：

1. 多相和均相自由基过程都起着重要作用。
2. 存在为分散的VOPO4相或(VO)2P2O7上的区域的氧化V5+位点直接参与顺丁烯二酸酐的形成。
3. 部分还原程度和立方晶体结构对于优异的催化剂性能至关重要。
4. 体相氧离子（限于几个表面原子层）和化学吸附物种都参与了丁烷的多电子转化。
5. 反应可能始于催化剂表面的C-H活化，随后的反应可能涉及表面和气相步骤。

这种方法允许选择性地氧化丁烷生成顺丁烯二酸酐，同时最大限度地减少完全燃烧为CO2。催化剂提供氧以插入碳氢化合物同时保持选择性的能力是反应成功的关键。
