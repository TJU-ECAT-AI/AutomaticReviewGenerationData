[1] "the site isolation theory, developed many years ago by Callahan and Grasselli [23], which claims the importance of having a statistically controlled number of surface oxidizing sites in order to favor selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions."

[2] "the mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity)"

[3] "The role of structural defects in favoring the mobility of ionic species in the bulk [13];"

[4] "the redox properties of the metal in transition metal oxide-based catalysts, in terms of reducibility and reoxidizability of the active sites, and the metaloxygen bond strength [3,5];"

[5] "It is well known that the oxidation state of transition metal ions which constitute the active component of mixed oxide-based catalysts is a function of the operating conditions for the reaction, since the surface of the catalyst is in dynamic interaction with the gas phase [2,21]."

[6] "In the case of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride over VPO catalysts, the contribution of homogeneous radical processes has also been postulated to play a fundamental role [168,169]."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: Having a controlled number of isolated surface oxidizing sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

2. Heterogeneous mechanism: At lower temperatures (below 450-500°C), the reaction occurs through formation of intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species on the catalyst surface.

3. Redox properties: The reducibility and reoxidizability of active sites, as well as metal-oxygen bond strength, play a key role in C-H activation.

4. Dynamic interaction: The oxidation state of transition metal ions changes based on reaction conditions, as the catalyst surface interacts with the gas phase.

5. Structural defects: These can promote mobility of ionic species in the bulk, potentially aiding C-H activation.

In the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, both heterogeneous and homogeneous radical processes are believed to play important roles. The reaction likely begins with C-H activation on the catalyst surface, followed by further reactions that may involve both surface and gas-phase steps. The redox properties of the vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalyst, particularly the ability to cycle between different oxidation states, are crucial for this process. The catalyst's ability to provide oxygen for insertion into the hydrocarbon while maintaining selectivity is key to the reaction's success.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 位点隔离：控制表面氧化位点的数量有利于选择性氧化反应而非燃烧反应。

2. 多相机制：在较低温度下（450-500°C以下），反应通过在催化剂表面形成中间态烷氧基或烷基自由基物种进行。

3. 氧化还原性质：活性位点的可还原性和可再氧化性，以及金属-氧键强度在C-H活化中起关键作用。

4. 动态相互作用：过渡金属离子的氧化态根据反应条件变化，因为催化剂表面与气相相互作用。

5. 结构缺陷：这些可以促进体相中离子物种的迁移，可能有助于C-H活化。

在工业丁烷选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酐的过程中，多相和均相自由基过程都被认为起着重要作用。反应可能始于催化剂表面的C-H活化，随后的反应可能涉及表面和气相步骤。钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂的氧化还原性质，特别是在不同氧化态之间循环的能力，对这个过程至关重要。催化剂提供氧以插入碳氢化合物同时保持选择性的能力是反应成功的关键。

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: By spacing out active metal centers, unwanted side reactions are minimized, improving selectivity. This is explained by the "site isolation theory".

2. Adsorbed oxygen species: Isolated metal sites can activate oxygen to form reactive adsorbed species that participate in C-H activation.

3. Redox cycling: Isolated metal centers can undergo redox changes (e.g. V5+ to V4+) as part of the catalytic cycle, abstracting hydrogen from alkanes. 

4. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the oxide can be inserted into the alkane, with the reduced metal site then re-oxidized.

In the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) catalysts employ these principles:

- Isolated V5+ sites on the catalyst surface are believed to be the active centers
- A Mars-van Krevelen mechanism likely operates, with lattice oxygen inserting into butane
- Redox cycling between V5+ and V4+ occurs during the reaction
- Careful control of the V5+/V4+ ratio and oxygen availability is key for optimizing selectivity

The reaction may also involve some gas-phase steps in addition to surface reactions, making it an intermediate case between fully heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Overall, the isolated nature of the active sites and controlled redox properties are crucial for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 位点隔离：通过隔开活性金属中心，可以最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，从而提高选择性。这可以用"位点隔离理论"来解释。

2. 吸附氧物种：孤立的金属位点可以活化氧以形成参与C-H活化的活性吸附物种。

3. 氧化还原循环：孤立的金属中心可以作为催化循环的一部分发生氧化还原变化（例如V5+到V4+），从烷烃中提取氢。

4. Mars-van Krevelen机理：氧化物中的晶格氧可以插入烷烃中，然后还原的金属位点再次被氧化。

在丁烷工业转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程中，钒焦磷酸盐（(VO)2P2O7）催化剂采用了这些原理：

- 催化剂表面上的孤立V5+位点被认为是活性中心
- 可能存在Mars-van Krevelen机理，晶格氧插入丁烷
- 反应过程中V5+和V4+之间发生氧化还原循环
- 仔细控制V5+/V4+比例和氧的可用性是优化选择性的关键

该反应可能还涉及一些气相步骤和表面反应，使其成为完全多相和均相催化之间的中间情况。总的来说，活性位点的孤立性质和受控的氧化还原性质对于丁烷选择性氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐至关重要。

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: The density and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface is crucial. Isolated metal centers provide specific adsorption sites for reactants and control the selectivity of the reaction.

2. Redox properties: The oxidation state of transition metal ions in the catalyst is dynamic and interacts with the gas phase. This allows for controlled oxidation and reduction cycles.

3. Oxygen species: Adsorbed oxygen species on the isolated metal centers play a key role in C-H bond activation.

4. Radical formation: Alkyl radical species can be generated at the catalyst surface as intermediates.

For the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) catalysts are used industrially. The reaction involves:

1. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates in the oxidation.

2. Presence of both V4+ and V5+ sites: Oxidized V5+ sites, either as dispersed VOPO4 phases or domains on (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in maleic anhydride formation.

3. Redox cycling: The catalyst undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the reaction cycle.

4. Controlled oxidation: The catalyst surface maintains a balance of oxidation states to achieve selectivity.

These principles allow for the selective oxidation of butane by controlling the C-H activation steps and subsequent oxidation pathways, ultimately leading to the desired maleic anhydride product.
