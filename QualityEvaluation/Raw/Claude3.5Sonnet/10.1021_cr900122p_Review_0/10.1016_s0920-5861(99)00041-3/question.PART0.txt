Abstract
Some aspects concerning the chemistry of oxidative transformation of parafns catalyzed by different classes of materials
are examined. Attention is given mainly to: (i) the role of the redox properties of transition metal oxide-based systems, and (ii)
the contribution of radical-type, homogeneous and heterogeneously-initiated homogeneous reactions over nonreducible metal
oxide catalysts. Technological solutions aimed at the control of oxidizing properties of the catalyst are also examined. # 1999

Introduction
Interest in the transformation of light alkanes to
valuable oxygenated compounds and olens by means
of oxidation has been growing in recent years due to
the possibility of developing new processes of lower
environmental impact and of lower cost. Many
reviews and monographs have been published [1
21] which analyze the fundamental aspects related
to the oxidative activation and transformation of light
alkanes over heterogeneous catalysts. The general
picture that can be drawn on the basis of the most
important factors which are examined in these reviews
clearly shows that the problem of parafn conversion
and of selectivity to the desired product has to be
solved within a complex framework of inter-related
aspects. In particular, the interaction between the
catalyst surface and the gas phase, and how surface
phenomena are affected by homogeneous phenomena,
plays an important role in conditioning the nal
performance in terms of product distribution.
In this paper, after a brief summary of the main
aspects, which have been claimed as fundamental for
the control of catalytic performance in the selective
oxidation of alkanes, attention is focused on the
following: (i) role of the redox properties of the active
sites for catalysts based on reducible metal oxides, and
(ii) role of the nonredox activation of hydrocarbons
and of radical reactions in affecting the catalytic
performance for catalysts based on nonreducible
metal
oxides.
Technological
implications
which
derive from these aspects are also discussed.

transformation to the product of selective oxidation
are:
1. The activation of oxygen and of the alkane, and
specically:
1.1. the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,
7,11];
1.2. the importance of the mode of alkane adsorp-
tion [13,5].
2. The reactivity of the reactant and of the product(s):
2.1. the mechanism of activation of the CH
bond (heterolytic vs homolytic activation)
[11,13];
2.2. the role of stability of the products [9,10,12].
3. The mechanism of transformation of the reactant:
3.1. the importance of nondesorption of reaction
intermediates [9,10];
3.2. the importance of the relative ratio between
intermediate
olefin
(oxy)dehydrogenation
and oxygen insertion in affecting the selec-
tivity to oxygenated products [9,10];
3.3. the role of the nature of the reaction inter-
mediate (hydrocarbon fragment) in determin-
ing the direction of oxidative transformation
[11];
3.4. the contribution of homogeneous reactions,
especially for applications which require tem-
peratures higher than 4004508C [12];
3.5. the effect of coadsorbates in facilitating the
dissociative adsorption of saturated hydrocar-
bons [12].
A better understanding of each one of the above
factors means a better comprehension of the overall
process of alkane transformation, and hence an
improved possibility of increasing the catalytic per-
formance to make these processes more attractive
from an industrial point of view.
3.
Key bulk and surface properties of catalysts
which affect performance
The following catalyst features have been consid-
ered as fundamental tools to control the catalytic
performance:
1. The surface of the catalyst: the nature of the active
sites, and how the surface is affected by the bulk
features and specically:
1.1. the density of the active sites [3,9,10], which
can be explained by the site isolation
theory [23];
1.2. the role of surface acidity [8,11];
1.3. the need for intrinsic surface polyfunctional-
ity [9,10].
2. The structure of the catalyst:
2.1. the redox properties of the metal in transition
metal oxide-based catalysts, in terms of
reducibility and reoxidizability of the active
sites, and the metaloxygen bond strength
[3,5];
2.2. the reactivity of specific crystal faces in the
different transformations which constitute the
reaction network [3,2,6];
2.3. the role of structural defects in favoring the
mobility of ionic species in the bulk [13];
2.4. the importance of cooperative effects of dif-
ferent phases in obtaining catalysts with
improved performances [12,22];
2.5. the importance of the interaction between the
support and the active phase in modifying the
catalytic properties of the latter [12].
Most of these aspects may be applied in general to
hydrocarbon oxidation while some of them are spe-
cic for alkane transformations.

selective oxidation which are of industrial interest, and

following
the

crisis
which
steadily
increased the interest in the use of natural gas com-
ponents as the preferred raw materials, research in this
area has been moving from n-butane exploitation, with
the successful development of the process for maleic
anhydride synthesis, towards lighter and less reactive
alkanes [2427] and towards the development of
processes which make direct use of these components
through exothermal processes. The challenge of trans-
562

forming methane to liquid fuels was approached
rst with research on the oxidative coupling to
ethane and ethylene (also with an interest in the
pyrolytic dimerization of methyl chloride, the latter
being produced by methane chlorination or oxyhydro-
chlorination) and on the oxidation to methanol. More
recently the oxidation to syngas appears to be one of
the most promising routes for methane employment
[2831].
The possibility of transforming ethane to acetic acid
in one- step is conditioned by the high chemical
stability of ethylene, one of the most favored products
in ethane oxidative conversion [3234]. For the same
reason, one possible commercial exploitation of
ethane consists in a reaction where the olen itself
becomes the raw material for the transformation to a
valuable chemical, either in the same reactor (it is
necessary that the second reaction can be carried
out under conditions which are close to those
necessary for ethane activation), or in an integrated
process, where the ethylene-containing stream exiting
from the rst reactor is the feedstock (after necessary
make-up) for the second reactor. An example is the
single-step or two-step ethane oxychlorination to 1,2-
dichloroethane and to vinyl chloride, where the ethy-
lene produced may easily be transformed to the
chlorinated products. This process was studied in
the 1970s [35,36], but did not reach commercial
application. Interest is now growing again, as docu-
mented by recent patents issued by companies which
are PVC suppliers [37].
The second successful heterogeneous gas-phase
process which has going reached the commercializa-
tion stage (besides the oxidation of n-butane), is the
ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile, developed
by BP America, for which uidized-bed technology is
employed [3846]. Also in this case the stability of the
product, which saves it from unselective consecutive
reactions, has been a key factor for the process devel-
opment.
Currently,
papers
are
being
published
which
describe attempts to transform isobutane into metha-
crolein and methacrylic acid in a single-step, a process
that might replace the acetonecyanohydrin technol-
ogy, and propane to acrylic acid [4755]. Interest from
the industrial companies for this kind of reaction
indeed goes back to the 1980s [56]. In these reactions
a further problem arises due to the high reactivity of
the desired products, which under conditions neces-
sary for alkane activation are not stable and undergo
unselective oxidative transformations.
The availability of C5 parafns, as a consequence of
environmental regulations which require a lower
vapor pressure of gasolines, and the discovery that
n-pentane can be transformed with unexpected selec-
tivity to valuable compounds, i.e. maleic anhydride
and phthalic anhydride, can open new prospects in the
exploitation of saturated raw materials [5768]. In this
case, the key factor for industrial commercialization is
the achievement of a high selectivity to phthalic
anhydride, possibly close to that obtained from
o-xylene.
The huge number of papers devoted to the oxidative
dehydrogenation of parafns is an indication of the
scientic and industrial interest for alternatives to
catalytic and thermal dehydrogenation/cracking, reac-
tions which suffer from energetic drawbacks [5,9,17
20]. In these cases, the advantage gained from the use
of a cheaper raw material and of an exothermal
process must be weighed against the drawbacks such
as the loss of valuable hydrogen (coproduced in

dehydrogenation and in stream-cracking), the dif-
culty in separation of CO from the parafn (in the case
of ethane oxydehydrogenation, but also of methane
oxidative coupling to ethylene), and the formation of
traces of corrosive by-products. While in the case
of ethane the problem mainly concerns the low
reactivity of the molecule (the selectivity to the
olen which is achieved is usually high, due to the
low ethylene reactivity and to the nature of the
mechanism involved), the selectivity problem is of
main concern in the case of oxydehydrogenation of
propane and of n-butane to the corresponding olens.
With the latter molecules, the formation of allylic
oxygenated compounds is the reason for the low
selectivity achieved since these are transformed to
carbon oxides.

Classes of catalysts for selective oxidation of
alkanes
We shall now analyze aspects associated with
the catalyst properties and the nature of the inter-
action between the gas phase and the catalyst only
for those reactions which are catalyzed by solid
materials, and where reactants and products are pre-
sent in the gas phase (heterogeneous gas-phase pro-
cesses). Three main classes of catalysts will be
discussed:
1. catalysts based on reducible metal oxides (typi-
cally, transition metal oxides), for which a
heterogeneous, redox-type mechanism is operat-
ing (a particular case is that where the reaction
indeed consists of a rst step occurring in the gas
phase, and a second step which occurs on the
surface of the catalyst);
2. catalysts based on nonreducible metal oxides (or
sometimes, systems which are very difficult to
reduce under the reaction conditions), for which
the mechanism is initiated on the catalyst and then
transferred into the gas phase (or at least, in the
close proximity of the catalyst surface);
3. noble metal-based catalysts, which are usually
considered
as nonselective oxidation
systems
(i.e. they are typically used for combustion), but
which under particular reaction conditions may
become selective catalysts.
5.1.
Redox-type catalysts: interaction between the
gas phase and metal component, and role of the
redox properties of the latter under reaction
conditions
It is well known that the oxidation state of transition
metal ions which constitute the active component of
mixed oxide-based catalysts is a function of the
operating conditions for the reaction, since the surface
of the catalyst is in dynamic interaction with the gas
phase [2,21]. If operation is carried out under fuel-rich
conditions (thus under conditions in which molecular
oxygen is the limiting reactant) the active component
has a lower oxidation state than under fuel-lean con-
ditions. This also affects the catalytic performance in
terms of activity and selectivity. Indeed, more oxi-
dized surfaces usually result in more active but less
selective catalysts, while the opposite is true for more
reduced surfaces. This has been the fundamental
driving force for the development of processes which
operate in the presence of very low amounts of oxygen
in the gas phase; other advantages are related to the
absence of hazards associated with the possible for-
mation of ammable mixtures (which are instead
present when the combustible and the oxidant are
co-fed).
A lower oxidation state for the metal ion corre-
sponds to a surface which is poorer in oxygen ions, and
thus exhibits either a lower number of O2-insertion
sites or possibly an electron-richer surface where the
metaloxygen bond strength is different from that of
the fully oxidized surface, this resulting in sites with
modied oxidizing properties. All this in practice
corresponds to the well known site-isolation'' theory,
developed many years ago by Callahan and Grasselli
[23], which claims the importance of having a statis-
tically controlled number of surface oxidizing sites in
order to favor selective oxidation reactions over com-
bustion reactions.
In general, the mechanism which operates is com-
pletely heterogeneous and includes the formation of
an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical spe-
cies). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures
(i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature
being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions,
such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii)
the alkane reactivity), and is often found for transition
metal oxide-based catalysts. Either the olen or other
564

oxygenated products can be the prevailing product,
depending on the nature of the alkane. The ratio of the
rates of further reaction of this intermediate with
activated oxygen, to give carbon oxides, and alkoxy
evolution to the desired products, determines the
selectivity of the reaction.
Some examples can be found in the literature where
the importance of the redox properties of the active
sites in determining the catalytic performance is
emphasized. These will be discussed in the following
Chapters.
5.1.1.
Oxidation of propane to acrylic acid and of
isobutane to methacrylic acid over Keggin-
type heteropolymolybdates
Heteropolycompounds are currently being studied
intensively for the oxidation of hydrocarbons with
molecular oxygen [9,6974]. The oxidation of isobu-
tane to methacrylic acid and of propane to acrylic acid
are examples of possible industrial applications. It is
claimed that a lower average oxidation state for
molybdenum
results
in
a
higher
selectivity
to
methacrylic acid. In particular, it has been reported
that particularly designed preparation procedures may
lead to more reduced compounds, exhibiting enhanced
selectivity properties in the oxidation of propane and
of isobutane. For example, in patents claimed by Asahi
Chem. Ind. [56,7577] the two essential requirements
for catalysts of superior performance are: (i) a partial
degree of reduction, and (ii) a cubic crystalline struc-
ture. These two properties are achieved by calcination
of ammonium salts of 12-molybdophosphoric acid
(Keggin-type heteropolycompound H3PMo12O40) in
a nitrogen atmosphere. The partial reduction of
molybdenum can also be achieved by treatment with
isobutene at 4508C. It is known [78] that ammonium
may be released from the heteropolycompound struc-
ture in the form of molecular nitrogen, leaving
reduced sites. Asahi has also claimed an improved
performance in isobutane oxidation to methacrylic
acid by operation in two reaction vessel: (i) a vessel
where the catalyst is put in contact with isobutane and
where methacrylic acid is produced, and (ii) a regen-
eration vessel where the reduced catalyst is restored to
its original oxidation state by contact with air.
Highly reduced heteropolycompounds have been
obtained by heat treatment of pyridinium or quinolium
salts of 12-molybdophosphoric acids under a nitrogen
stream at 4208C [55]. The authors demonstrated that
the reduced state of the catalyst was stable even under
catalytic conditions, and yielded acrylic acid from
propane with 50% selectivity at 12% parafn conver-
sion. A reduced state could also be achieved by
treatment of the ammonium salt of 12-molybdopho-
sphoric acid (NH4)3PMo12O40, but the molybdenum
was
reoxidized
under
reaction
conditions.
The
reduced state achieved by treatment of the pyridinium
salt could therefore be stabilized even under condi-
tions which favor the reoxidation of molybdenum. On
the contrary, the oxidized catalyst was not selective in
the oxidation of propane, and mainly yielded propene
and carbon oxides. Mizuno et al. [53] have also
pointed out the importance of partially reduced
molybdenum in heteropolycompounds, in achieving
the best performance in isobutane and propane oxida-
tion.
All these data indicate that the best reaction con-
ditions are those which may favor a lower oxidation
state of molybdenum. In fact, in most papers and
patents, compositions on the fuel-rich side of the
ammability region for isobutane/oxygen/inert mix-
tures are used; under these conditions, oxygen is the
limiting reactant, and hydrocarbon conversions not
higher than 15% are obtained.
Fig. 1 shows the effect of the hydrocarbon content
of the feed for a xed amount of oxygen on the overall
rate of isobutane consumption and on the selectivity to

the products for a doped Keggin-type heteropolycom-
pound. The isobutane consumption increases on
increasing the isobutane concentration and the selec-
tivity to the products of interest increases as the
isobutane content in the feed increases.
Fig. 2 shows the ex situ UV-Vis-DRS spectrum of a
(NH4)3PMo12O40 heteropolycompound after reaction
(cooled in helium and immediately characterized).
Fig. 2(a) shows the spectrum for a sample after opera-
tion at the fuel-lean side (1 mol% isobutane and 12%
oxygen in the feed), while Fig. 2(b) shows spectrum
for a sample unloaded after operation under isobutane-
rich conditions (26 mol% isobutane and 12% oxygen).
The band at 700 nm is typical of Mo5 in heteropoly-
blues, and its intensity is approximately proportional
to the extent of molybdenum reduction [79]. The
catalyst which operates under fuel-lean conditions
is less reduced than the catalyst which operates under
hydrocarbon-rich conditions.
These data conrm the importance of the degree of
molybdenum oxidation in heteropolycompounds used
as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation
of propane and of isobutane. Since the oxidation state
of molybdenum is a function of the gas-phase com-
position, the optimal situation might be theoretically
reached if a reduced, more selective catalyst oxidation
state could be maintained even under oxidizing con-
ditions (i.e. at low hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio), thus
under conditions which are typically less favourable
for selectivity [55].
5.1.2.
Oxydehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins
over vanadium oxide-based catalysts
Amongst the factors which affect the selectivity to
olens in the oxydehydrogenation of parafns over
vanadium oxide-based catalysts, particular impor-
tance has been attributed to the average oxidation
state of the vanadium [5]. In fact, the degree of
reduction of the active site in magnesium vanadates
affects the metaloxygen bond strength (and hence the
reducibility of metal cations), nally inuencing the
ratio between the olen and carbon oxides produced.
In the case of alumina-supported vanadium oxide, a
catalyst for the oxydehydrogenation of n-butane to
butenes and butadiene, the results of pulse tests
showed that the selectivity to the desired product
increased rapidly as the catalyst was progressively
reduced (i.e. with increasing hydrocarbon pulse num-
ber) [80,81]. For the same reason, supported vanadium
oxide systems in which partly reduced vanadium
phases develop, stabilized by the interaction with
the underlying support, are more selective in the
formation of olens. On the contrary, bulk V2O5
(found, for instance, at high vanadia loading in sup-
ported systems) has a considerably lower selectivity to
olens [8285].
5.1.3.
Oxidation of n-butane and n-pentane over
vanadyl pyrophosphate
The role of different vanadium phosphate phases,
and of the valence state of vanadium in the selective
oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride has been
widely studied [9,16,61,8695]. In general, the funda-
mental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7
as the active phase is recognized but it is generally
believed that oxidized V5 sites, present as dispersed
VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophos-
phate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100)
face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the for-
mation of maleic anhydride. The simultaneous pre-
sence of V4 and V5 seems to guarantee the best
catalytic performance. However, Guliants et al. [87],
who proposed that the best catalytic system is the one
which only contains vanadyl pyrophosphate with well
ordered stacking of the (200) planes.
The oxygen species which are involved in the multi-
electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk
oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few
surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species

[9497]. It seems that even though the vanadyl pyro-
phosphate is very well crystallized and formally
contains no V5 species, patches'' or dispersed
V5 species develop in the reaction environment
(either by chemical adsorption of oxygen, or by
oxidation of vanadyl pyrophosphate layers to form
VOPO4 phases, namely d-VOPO4), which make a
fundamental contribution to the mechanism of forma-
tion of maleic anhydride. In some cases, VOPO4
phases are already present in the catalyst, especially
when the compound has been calcined in air prior to
the reaction [61]. In addition, the formation of oxi-
dized VOPO4 phases in the reactor will be affected by:
(i) the reaction conditions, i.e. temperature and gas
phase composition (differences in the average oxida-
tion state of vanadium in the equilibrated catalyst
unloaded from a xed bed may be expected between
that of the catalyst placed at the reactor inlet, where
the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio is the highest, and
that at the exit, where the ratio is the lowest); and (ii)
the bulk features of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, such
as its crystallinity and P/V ratio [9]. In fact, well
crystallized (VO)2P2O7 exhibits a tendency towards
oxidation which is different with respect to badly
crystallized or microcrystalline vanadyl pyropho-
sphate. It is worth mentioning that spent equilibrated
catalyst may exhibit a vanadium valence state which
varies from 4.00 [60,61,87], to 4.02 [95], or be even
higher [93,98].
The important role of the valence state of vanadium
in affecting the catalytic properties in n-butane and
butene oxidation over VPO catalysts has also been
demonstrated by means of pulse tests and by an ex situ
characterization of catalysts unloaded after reaction at
different reaction conditions (i.e. different hydrocar-
bon-to-oxygen ratios in the feed) [99,100]. It was
found that at low n-butane conversion (i.e. under
conditions in which the consecutive contribution of
maleic anhydride combustion is negligible) the selec-
tivity was proportional to the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen
ratio, and that at high n-butane conversion the selec-
tivity to maleic anhydride rapidly decreased as the
average degree of oxidation of vanadium increased. It
was proposed that a limited amount of surface V5 is
necessary to obtain the highest selectivity to maleic
anhydride but that excessive vanadium oxidation leads
to an enhancement of the consecutive combustion of
maleic anhydride.
The existence of a limited amount of benecial
V5 corresponds, in practice, to the necessity for
discrete amounts on the catalyst surface of O-insertion
sites which may favor the transformation of inter-
mediates (i.e. olen species) to the nal product. Also
in the case of n-pentane oxidation over VPO cat-
alysts, the distribution of the products is affected
considerably by the availability of O-insertion sites.
In this case, the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the
feed not only modies the relative ratio between
the products of selective oxidation and of carbon
oxides, but also the ratio between maleic and phthalic
anhydrides [6063]. Results concerning the oxidation
of n-pentane over an equilibrated vanadyl pyropho-
sphate catalyst are shown in Fig. 3, where the overall
rate of parafn consumption and the selectivity to the
products are reported as functions of the parafn
content in the feed, for a xed amount of oxygen
[62]. The results obtained can be summarized as
follows:
1. For amounts of hydrocarbon which increase in the
range 02 mol% (Fig. 3(a)), the rate of transfor-
mation of the parafn is proportional to the
hydrocarbon content. In this range, the conversion
of n-pentane decreases (but the rate of hydro-
carbon depletion increases), the overall selectivity
to maleic plus phthalic anhydride increases, and
the ratio phthalic-to-maleic anhydride also in-
creases. This means that under conditions under
which the catalyst surface is not saturated, a
decrease in the oxidizing power of the gas phase
leads to a more favorable surface situation, in
terms of specic centers for the transformation to
the nal stable products. This is the same
phenomenon as the one displayed in Fig. 1 for
isobutane oxidation over an heteropolycompound-
based catalyst.
2. Things change considerably under conditions of
surface saturation, thus under conditions at which
the rate of n-pentane transformation levels out, i.e.
above 2% paraffin content in the feed (Fig. 3(b)).
The selectivity to products of interest is lowered to
1015%, while the formation of carbon oxides
becomes largely kinetically favored. At the same
time,
other
by-products
(aldehydes,
ketones,
hydrocarbon fragments) appear, which, on the
contrary, are not observed at all for low n-pentane

567
concentrations in the feed. Therefore, when the
surface is saturated with adsorbed species, the
formation of the final stable products (maleic
and phthalic anhydrides) is hindered, due to the
scarcity of O-insertion sites. Under these condi-
tions, the reaction becomes nonselective because
intermediate olefinic species desorb into the gas
phase or are attacked by unselective oxygen spe-
cies either in the gas phase or directly in the
adsorbed state. The main difference with respect
to data reported in Fig. 1 therefore concerns the
lower availability of active sites on the vanadyl
pyrophosphate for the oxidation of n-pentane rela-
tive to those on heteropolycompound as the cata-
lyst for isobutane oxidation.
It is interesting to note that when 1 mol% of 2-
pentene in air is fed to the reactor, the same distribu-
tion of products is observed as in the case when a high
concentration of n-pentane (i.e. 20 mol%) is oxidized
[101]. This is shown in Fig. 4 which compares the
selectivity to the products from the two reactants
under the two different reaction conditions. It is shown
that the overall selectivity to maleic plus phthalic
anhydride from 2-pentene is around 1015%, the
remainder being mainly carbon oxides and other
unsaturated products of partial oxidation (the overall
selectivity of which is around 15%). This indicates
that when the olen is used as reactant, surface
saturation occurs at much lower hydrocarbon partial
pressure than with n-pentane, due to the high nucleo-
philicity of the olenic reactant which makes easier
interaction with the Lewis acid centers of the vanadyl
pyrophosphate. Under these conditions, the situation
on the catalyst surface is the same as when high
concentrations of n-pentane are fed. An increase in
the oxygen partial pressure favors the selectivity to the
anhydrides, even though the selectivity with the olen
never reaches the same values that are obtained with n-
pentane [62,101].

Mixed homogeneous/heterogeneous reactions
on redox-type catalysts
Particular cases, which can be considered as inter-
mediates between completely heterogeneous mechan-
isms and homogeneous reactions are those reactions
which, even though they occur on redox-type catalytic
systems, include a rst step which occurs in the gas
phase. An example has been reported by Moro-oka
and coworkers [102,103] for the oxidation of propane
to acrolein over Ag/Bi/V/Mo mixed oxides, where the
contribution of homogeneous reactions was found to
play a fundamental role and to lead to substantially
higher yields with respect to completely heteroge-
neous mechanisms. In particular, under the conditions
employed (temperature around 5008C), the thermal
dehydrogenation of propane in the gas phase led to the
formation of propene, which was then selectively
converted to acrolein on the catalyst surface by
O-insertion sites.
5.3.
Nonredox-type catalysts; the contribution of
radical-type homogeneous reactions
A considerable amount of research work has been
done on the use of nonreducible metal oxides as
catalysts for the oxidation of light parafns. The
most important is the case of methane oxidative
coupling, where most active catalysts are those
based on alkaline earth oxides, such as MgO and
CaO, doped with alkali metal ions, but the same
class of catalysts has also been found to be active
and selective in the oxydehydrogenation of ethane
to ethylene [17,104115]. Since these compounds
lack bulk-O-insertion properties, they are not used
when the reaction is aimed at the production of
oxygenates.
Systems which are known to operate a nonredox-
type activation of molecular oxygen and/or of parafn
are [17]:
Alkaline earth oxides. Alkaline earth oxides,
doped with various components aimed at increas-
ing the contribution of surface defects in hydro-
carbon and oxygen activation [31,104]. These are
essentially p-type semiconductors, at least at the
temperatures used for paraffin activation. Alkali
metal-doped and rare earth-doped alkaline earth
compounds are amongst the most effective cata-
lysts for methane oxidative dimerization [104
115]. Promotion by chlorine, either fed directly
to the reactor as chlorine-containing compounds or
added in the catalyst composition, lowers the
reaction temperature considerably and increases
the selectivity to ethylene in methane oxidative
coupling and in ethane oxydehydrogenation [116
121]. The halogen has to be fed continuously to the
reactor in order to maintain the best catalytic
performance. The effect of chlorine can be differ-
ent: (i) gas-phase reactions involving chlorine
radicals can contribute measurably to the activa-
tion of the paraffin and to the formation of ethy-
lene from ethane, thus increasing both conversion
and selectivity; (ii) chlorine-modified active sites
may be involved in the reaction; in particular,
chlorine may inhibit the centers responsible for
total oxidation. In these systems, the role of alkali
metal dopants is fundamental in the creation of the
surface defects able to activate molecular oxygen.
Alkali metals are also important promoters for
TiO2 [122] and for MnO2. The Na4P2O7/MnO2/
SiO2 system is the catalyst claimed by ARCO for
the process of methane oxidative coupling and for
the oxydehydrogenation of ethane under cyclic
operation, where the catalyst is continuosly with-
drawn from the hydrocarbon contact zone and
passed to the oxidation zone for coke removal
[123126].
Rare earth oxides. Rare earth oxides, which are p-
type semiconductors (La2O3, Sm2O3, Dy2O3),
even though ionic-type conductivity can contri-
bute in some cases [127136]. Cerium and pra-
seodymium oxides (which instead are n-type
semiconductors, and also exhibit remarkable ionic
conductivity)
are
nonselective
to
C2
from
methane, and in paraffin oxydehydrogenation as
well [137], due to the high activity in methyl
radical attack by active oxygen species which
leaves less time for methyl radical dimerization
[138]. Alkaline earth metal-doped or alkali metal-
doped rare earth oxides are particularly effective
catalysts [139,140].
Boron oxide-based catalysts. Boron oxide has
been described to be an efficient catalyst for the
oxidation of ethane to acetaldehyde or to ethylene
[141145], and of propane to propylene [146]. The

main problem of this material is its high volatility
which makes the catalyst lose activity rapidly due
to the loss of the active component. However, it
can be stabilized by interaction with a support or
by formation of stable compounds, typically phos-
phates. The mechanism which has been proposed
to occur consists of the generation of alkyl radicals
at the boron oxide surface, which are then released
to the gas phase, while dissociatively adsorbed
oxygen is mainly responsible for the formation of
carbon oxides.
Tin oxide-based catalysts. Tin oxide, a n-type
wide-gap semiconducting oxide, supported on
silica or alumina and doped with alkali metals
catalyzes the oxidative coupling of methane. It is
effective mainly as a dopant for the Li/MgO
system, since it reduces the loss of lithium under
reaction conditions and also promotes activity
[147]. However, tin oxide alone as well as
SnO2P2O5 activate ethane and yield ethylene
with good selectivity especially at superatmo-
spheric pressures [148,149]. The formation of
an ethoxy intermediate was postulated.
Silica. Silica also exhibits unexpected oxidizing
properties. It has been found to be active in the
oxidation of methane to formaldehyde [150].
Silica also is active in the ammoximation of
cyclohexanone to cyclohexanone oxime, inter-
mediate in the synthesis of caprolactam [151
153]. In these cases it has been proposed that
surface defects (reduced sites) are the sites for
the generation of active oxygen species [152,153].
The formation of O
2 species, which are initiators
of radical reactions occurring on the solid surface,
was detected by means of EPR and measurements
of surface potential.
The contribution of homogeneous radical reactions
in alkane oxidation can in general be neglected for
those catalysts which typically operate at lower tem-
peratures. On the contrary, gas-phase reactions may
play a fundamental role when operation is carried out
at higher temperatures, thus typically on nonredox-
type catalysts [5,12,104,154159]. Rare earth oxides
and alkaline earth oxides, and in general nonreducible
metal oxides, activate methane and ethane only at
temperatures higher than 5006008C. Besides the high
temperatures used, reactant mixtures are often used
with compositions which fall inside the ammability
region; in the case of more reactive alkanes, the
temperatures used are close to the autoignition tem-
peratures. In these cases, the contribution of homo-
geneous reactions becomes fundamental.
The mechanism which operates in these cases
usually involves a fundamental contribution of alkyl
radical species which are generated at the catalyst
surface and then: (i) react quickly in the adsorbed state
(for instance, by being transformed to the correspond-
ing olen via b-elimination, or by undergoing non-
selective
oxidative
attack
by
adsorbed
oxygen
species), (ii) react further in the close proximity to
the catalyst surface (i.e. in the boundary layer), or (iii)
become transferred into the gas phase where the
reaction proceeds.
The further evolution of alkyl radical fragments in
the gas phase is known to be a function of temperature.
In general, the reaction between CnH
2n1 and O2
below 3303508C proceeds mainly by a simple, rever-
sible addition process with formation of a peroxide
CnH2n1O2
 species that is thermally stable. Under
these conditions, the adduct may either be converted to
oxygenated products (aldehydes or others, which may
also be precursors of carbon oxides):

etc. or be converted directly to CO2, possibly also
by oxygen species adsorbed on the catalyst surface.
Only minor amounts of olen are formed (for C>1
alkanes), via direct H abstraction from the CnH
2n1 by
oxygen:
CnH
2n1  O2?CnH2n  HO
2
The selectivity to CnH2n is therefore low.
Above 3508C, for the case of methane and ethane
oxidation over rare earth oxides and alkaline earth
oxides, the formation of the olen is preferred with
570

 / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 561580
respect to other oxygenated compounds. Since at high
temperature the equilibrium:
CnH
2n1  O2?CnH2n1O
2
is strongly in favor of the hydrocarbon, consumption
of the radical to yield the olen must be accounted for
by a different mechanism. Direct H abstraction by O2
may occur, or alternatively, the elementary addition
produces an excited alkylperoxy species which, at
high temperature, is quickly decomposed to the olen
and HO
2 via an intermediate alkylhydroperoxy spe-
cies [160].

The contribution of homogeneous reactions in het-
erogeneously-initiated alkane oxidation thus can
easily explain the increase in the selectivity to the
olen which is usually observed with increasing tem-
perature. This has been observed with ethane because
ethylene is a stable product. With higher parafns,
however, the high reactivity of the allylic methyl
group in the olens produced causes the selectivity
to decrease with increasing temperature.
Other reactions involving the alkyl radical are the
dimerization pathway (which is fundamental for the
methyl radical), and chain branching occurring by
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxy radi-
cals OH, very active species that initiate a chain
mechanism by reacting with the alkane:

In the case of methane, after the methyl radical
species has been formed at temperatures higher than
6008C at the catalyst surface and has desorbed from
the surface, the formation of CH3O2
 is highly unfa-
vored thermodynamically. The two reactions of
methyl radical dimerization to produce ethane and
of methyl radical oxidation to give formaldehyde by
reaction with HO
2 (or with atomic oxygen) are
favored. Since methyl radicals can also interact with
gas-phase oxygen, leading to the formation of carbon
oxides, control of the gas-phase composition, and the
ability of the catalyst to convert oxygen rapidly into
surface selective species are factors which determine
the control of the process selectivity [31].
In the case of ethane oxydehydrogenation, the
mechanism can also include the fundamental contri-
bution of gas-phase radical reactions [17,18,111,154
156,161] and also in this case, at high temperatures the
formation of ethylene by evolution of the ethyl radical
is the preferred reaction. The selectivity of the process
is therefore affected considerably by the nature of the
intermediate species (either an ethoxy species or an
ethyl radical species) which is generated on the cat-
alyst surface.
In the case of propane oxidation, the higher reac-
tivity of the CH bond makes the contribution of
homogeneous reactions more likely than in the case
of ethane. (However, lower temperatures are usually
needed to activate this parafn.) Indeed, the activation
of propane with generation of the propyl radical may
occur either on the catalyst surface or even in the gas
phase by a thermal (pyrolysis) process. Moreover, due
to the presence of the activated methyl group in the
propylene produced, this olen is much more reactive
than ethylene. Contributions of homogeneous reac-
tions have been found for the reaction of propane
oxydehydrogenation to propylene when operating at
temperatures higher than 4508C [154,162164].
In the case of n-butane, butene may be produced in
the gas phase at high temperatures via cracking of the
butyl radical, while at low temperatures the butyl
radical is preferentially transformed to oxygenated
products (mainly aldehydes and ketones, such as
methylethylketone, methylvynilketone, crotonalde-
hyde and butanal). Oxygenates can also decompose
yielding lower oxygenates such as formaldehyde and
acetaldehyde [165]:

or can be burnt to carbon oxides.
The lighter oxygenates may also arise from rear-
rangement and decomposition of the C4 alkyl peroxy
radical. The nature of the products evolving from the

571
alkyl radical species (either oxygenates or olens) is
therefore once again mainly a function of temperature.
A further reaction, intramolecular H abstraction, is
made possible by the molecule length (mechanism of
back-biting'') [166,167]:
CH3CH2HCCH3  O2
?CH3CH2HCOO
CH3
HCH2CH2HCOO

The hydroperoxy species is the precursor of acetone
formation.
An increase in the number of carbon atoms makes
the mechanism of intramolecular rearrangement of
alkylperoxy radicals and of radical fragmentation
more important.
In the case of isobutane oxydehydrogenation to
isobutene over P/W, Keggin-type heteropolycom-
pounds, the contribution of homogeneous radical pro-
cesses has also been postulated to play a fundamental
role [168,169]. In particular, it has been found that the
conversion of isobutane increased with increasing
isobutane concentration in the feed, thus correspond-
ing to a formal order of reaction for isobutane dis-
appearance higher than 1 (Fig. 5). The selectivity does
not decrease with increasing isobutane partial pres-
sure, thus leading to a remarkable increase in the
overall yield to the olen. The same phenomenon
was observed by Buyevskaya et al. [146] for propane
oxydehydrogenation over boriaalumina catalysts,
and for propane oxidation over boron phosphate cat-
alysts [170]. In all cases, it was proposed that the
mechanism begins on the catalyst surface, with gen-
eration of alkyl radicals, and that the reaction is then
transferred into the gas phase. The order of reaction
higher than 1 has been attributed to the presence of
homogeneous bimolecular reactions between the par-
afn and RO
2, leading to the regeneration of the chain
carrier R
 and of RO2H which is then decomposed to
the olen and to oxygenated compounds (propional-
dehyde, acetone and acrolein from propane) [170].
Alternatively, the phenomenon can be attributed to an
autocatalytic effect, brought about by the olen
formed which may interact with the catalyst surface,
generating more active surface centers, or may con-
tribute in chain propagation due to its weaker allylic
CH bond than that in isobutane [168]. In any case,
there are indications in the literature that when the
reaction mechanism for the oxydehydrogenation of
light parafns includes a contribution of gas-phase
reactions, operation at high hydrocarbon concentra-
tions may lead to a considerable increase in the rate of
reaction with improvement of both conversion and
yields.
In conclusion, when the mechanism of parafn
oxidation also involves homogeneous reactions, the
selectivity to olens may become considerably higher
than for completely heterogeneous mechanisms pro-
vided that the olen is stable enough to resist con-
secutive degradation reactions. From this point of
view, therefore, the contribution of homogeneous
reactions can be highly desired even though the cou-
pling of heterogeneous processes (needed to acceler-
ate the generation of the alkyl radical species) and of
homogeneous oxidative transformations may give rise
to serious problems from the technological and engi-
neering points of view. A problem may arise in trying
to avoid the consecutive reactions of combustion of
more reactive olens (C>2) and oxygenates since high
temperatures also favor homogeneous degradation of
these products. In these cases, as pointed out by
Goetsch et al. [165], it is necessary to quench the
product gases rapidly to enable the olens or oxyge-
nates to survive. Monolith-type reactors can be
favored since considerable differences in temperature
may be found between the catalyst surface and the gas

phase in the reactor void fraction under laminar-ow
conditions. In this way, very rapid parafn activation
and transformation are provided due to the high local
temperature at the catalyst surface and the consecutive
reactions of combustion of products are minimized by
quenching the latter with the cooler gases. On the
other hand, those systems which are characterized by
relatively high mass transfer rates may favor radical
termination via interactions with the surface rather
than nonselective homogeneous chain-branching reac-
tions and decomposition reactions of the oxygenates.
High ow rates increase the mass transfer of reactants
towards the catalytic surface by decreasing the thick-
ness of the boundary layer. In this way, the diffusion of
radicals formed in the gas phase towards the surface
(which acts as a radical scavenger) is also favored,
thus preventing undesired consecutive reactions in the
gas phase.
5.4.
Noble metal-based catalysts
In view of the results described above, the results of
Schmidt and coworkers [14,165,171176], who have
made an extensive study of parafn oxydehydrogena-
tion and methane partial oxidation in monolith-type
reactors under autothermal conditions, should be men-
tioned . Noble metal (Pt, Pd, Rh) coated ceramic foam
monoliths were used. These catalysts are usually
considered as being nonselective for the oxidation
of alkanes (i.e. they are used in combustion of hydro-
carbons); however, control of the oxygen-to-hydro-
carbon ratio as well as the high surface temperature
reached on the very active metal surface allowed the
reaction pathway to be directed towards the formation
of olens. In fact, the key point of this reactor type is
the large temperature difference between the catalyst
surface (where temperatures are as high as 10008C)
and the gas phase due to the limitation of the heat
exchange through the boundary layer. Moreover, the
residence time with respect to the thin layer of the
catalytically active component in these reactor con-
gurations is a few milliseconds. Very slow deactiva-
tion due to coke deposition was observed and the
selectivity to olens (ethylene from ethane, propylene
and ethylene from propane and from n-butane, pro-
pylene and isobutene from isobutane) was in most
cases higher than 60% with a very high fuel conver-
sion.

Technologies aimed at control of the oxygen
supply to the catalyst
In the case of redox-type catalysts, it is clear that
control of the redox properties of the catalyst is
fundamental in order to obtain the best catalytic
performance. Examples exist in the literature which
describe the use of reactor technologies aimed at
control of the oxygen supply to the reaction medium
for the selective oxidation of parafns. In particular,
there is considerable interest in the use of catalytic
membrane reactors, where the oxygen supply is con-
trolled either via selective ionic diffusion (dense
membranes), or through control of molecular diffusion
(inorganic porous membranes) [177179].
With porous inorganic membranes, the hydrocar-
bons and oxygen are fed separately to the core and
shell sides of the membrane reactors. One advantage
lies in the possibility of supplying oxygen to the
reaction zone (where the catalyst is placed) in a
distributed fashion over the entire reactor length,
instead of feeding it together with the hydrocarbon
at the reactor entrance (Fig. 6). The supply of the
oxidant to the reactor medium is therefore governed
by the laws of mass transport through the porous
membrane. In this way, the concentration of dioxygen
all along the reactor can be kept sufciently low to
favor kinetically the partial oxidation reactions instead
of complete hydrocarbon combustion and by keeping
the catalyst at a desired average oxidation level. A
further advantage of this conguration is that the
reactants are kept separate, thus avoiding any amm-
ability hazard; it is thus possible to feed undiluted
fuels.
Most publications which describe the use of mem-
brane reactors deal with methane oxidative coupling
[180183] but a few papers have described the oxy-
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [184186].
In the latter case, either a VMgO based catalyst
[184] or a g-Al2O3/V2O5 based catalyst [185,186] was
used; in both cases, the active component was coated
in the form of a thin layer over the ceramic a-alumina
membrane. No signicant membrane effect was found
with these mesoporous materials since they do not act
as effective gas barriers. In the case of the VMgO
system, no difference in performance was observed
between the cofeeding mode and the separate feeding
mode [184]. On the contrary, an improvement in
F. Cavani, F. Trifiro
 / Catalysis Today 51 (1999) 561580
573
selectivity was observed when a hybrid membrane
conguration was adopted with separate feeding in a
case when a VMgO catalyst bed was enclosed in a
microporous zeolitic membrane reactor. Analogously,
no differences between the cofeeding conguration
and separate feeding were observed in the case of the
g-Al2O3/V2O5 based catalyst dispersed on a ceramic
membrane [185,186]. However, an improvement in
selectivity to proylene, due to a lower contribution of
the consecutive reaction of propylene oxidation to
carbon oxides, was observed when the performance
obtained with the membrane reactor was compared
with that of a packed bed reactor (Fig. 7). Further-
more,
the
turnover
number
was
substantially
improved. This effect may be attributed either to a
distribution of the oxygen along the reactor (thus
achieving a more favorable hydrocarbon-to-oxygen
ratio all along the catalytic bed) or to a more ef-
cient transport mechanism (i.e. convection instead
of diffusion) [179] as a consequence of the very
low residence time of gaseous components with
respect to the thin layer of active component (in the
order of few milliseconds). A very low residence
time of the hydrocarbon in the catalytically active
material has also been claimed to be benecial for
selectivity in the dehydrogenation of methanol to
formaldehyde due to a more narrowly distributed
residence time of reactant and product in the narrow
pore size distribution of the catalytically active layer
with respect to the bulk particle of the same active
component [187].
Solid-electrolyte membranes for the ionic diffusion
of oxygen (via O2) are made of ZrO2, CeO2, ThO2,
Y2O3-ZrO2, or SrCeO2 [188]. Perovskite solids (La/
Sr, Y/Ba/Cu mixed oxides), are materials exhibiting
superior conduction rates as those can transport oxy-
gen with a rate of 1011109 mol cm2 s1 through a
vacancy diffusion mechanism, this being several
orders of magnitude higher than for conventional solid
electrolytes. The mechanism of diffusion consists of
dissociative chemisorption of dioxygen followed by
ionization of the atoms and transport of the latter

through the crystalline lattice to the opposite surface
where they lose their charge and again form oxygen.
The driving force for the diffusion of the O2 species
can be either a difference of pressure between the two
sides of the membrane or an electrical potential gra-
dient obtained by electrodes deposited on the sides of
the membrane. The possibility of pumping specic
ionic oxygen species at a controlled rate directly to the
catalytically active surface of the catalyst may allow
very specic oxidation reactions to be carried out, thus
with a very high theoretical selectivity to specic
products. The limitation of these materials is however
the low rate of permeation and thus the low produc-
tivity which can be achieved; permeation can be
facilitated by operation at high temperature (higher
than 6008C). In addition, one technological limit is the
problem of sealing these membranes into devices
which have to operate at high temperature.
Different applications in the eld of oxidation have
been claimed which make use of oxygen-conducting
electrolytes, especially in the oxidative transforma-
tions of methane [189,190]. In this case, a further
advantage is the rejection of nitrogen (when air is fed
to the shell side of the membrane). In this way it is
possible to overcome the problem associated with
separation of nitrogen from the products and from
unconverted reactant in the process of methane oxi-
dative coupling.
An electrochemical reactor using yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ) as a solid electrolyte and gold and
silver as the anode and the cathode respectively has
been used for the oxidation of alkanes at temperatures
lower than 4758C [191,192] and for the partial oxida-
tion of methane to syngas [193]. It was reported that
ethane, propane, butane and isobutane can be oxidized
with good specicity to aldehydes and ketones (acet-
aldehyde from ethane, acetone, propylene oxide and
acrylaldehyde
from
propane,
methylvinylketone,
methylethylketone and butyraldehyde from n-butane,
methacrolein from isobutane) even though at rather
low conversion.
Another remarkable example of a reactor technol-
ogy aimed at the control of oxygen supply is the CFBR
(Circulating Fluid Bed Riser) reactor developed by
DuPont for the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhy-
dride, and which is now commercially available [194
198]. Similar technologies for alkane oxidation have
been developed (but not yet made commercial) by
ARCO for methane oxidative coupling and for paraf-
n oxydehydrogenation [199] and by Monsanto for
propane ammoxidation [200] . Indeed, the rst exam-
ple in the eld of hydrocarbon selective oxidation was
developed for the ammoxidation of m-xylene [201].
All of these processes have a rst step which operates
under (almost) anaerobic conditions and a second step
in which the reduced catalyst undergoes reoxidation
by contact with molecular oxygen. It is thus possible
to decouple the two-steps of the redox reaction in two
separate reactors and make the hydrocarbon (HC)
interact with the catalyst in the absence of gas-phase
oxygen to yield the oxidized product (HCO):
HC  catox ! HCO  catred
catred  O2 ! catox
Continuous catalyst reactivation by transport from
the reaction vessel to the regeneration one is achieved.
In addition, very fast exothermic reactions can be
managed better than in uidized-bed reactors. The
operation becomes intrinsically safe since the hydro-
carbon and oxygen are not fed together but separately
in the two vessels. Other advantages with respect to
xed bed technology or conventional uidized-beds
are [16] as follows:
1. High exibility of the plant, since the two sections
can be designed and optimized separately by
choosing the best conditions for each. Only the
oxidation processes involving oxygen ion transfer
from the catalyst surface to the organic substrate
occur, while undesired reactions involving mole-
cular oxygen in the gas phase (i.e. homogeneous
reactions of combustion) do not occur.
2. Higher throughput because of the higher gas velo-
city and the possibility of independently optimiz-
ing the kinetic conditions for the two stages.
3. Excellent intragrain and interphase heat and mass
transfer because of the fine solid particles used and
of the high gas velocity relative to the solid. Con-
sequently, very high catalyst efficiencies can be
achieved and the thermal gradients inside the par-
ticle can be considered to be minimal.
4. Higher product concentration, and hence fewer
recovery problems.
5. As in turbulent fluidization, gassolid contacting is
improved with respect to the bubbling/slugging

6. The possibility of achieving better control of tem-
perature in the riser by efficient cooling (quench-
ing) through injection of cold gas along the
reaction pathway.
On the other hand, the disadvantages are:
1. The need for a catalyst with particular properties:
high attrition resistance and high availability of
active centers even in the absence of one reactant
(i.e. ready availability of bulk oxygen).
2. Significant uncertainty in scale-up due to radial and
axial gradients of the solid and the lack of a model
that allows for geometric parameters and disconti-
nuity at the inlet and outlet of the riser to be
foreseen.
Using a pilot CFBR reactor, 75% selectivity to
maleic anhydride at up to 50% n-butane conversion,
for hydrocarbon concentrations up to 50%, were
claimed. The rate of catalyst circulation is affected
by the amount of active oxygen available on the
catalyst surface. It was calculated that the available
oxygen corresponds to one surface monolayer arising
by oxidation of vanadium. When the rate-determining
step is catalyst reoxidation, a long residence time in
the reoxidation vessel is required, and therefore, in
order to achieve acceptable productivies of maleic
anhydride, very high energy costs for circulating large
amounts of catalyst are required [202].

Conclusions
Three main classes of catalysts have been described
for the selective oxidation of light alkanes, and those,
due to their very different characteristics, operate
under different temperature conditions and give rise
to different reaction mechanisms:
1. Redox metal oxide-based catalysts, which are
active below 4004508C and for which the
mechanism can be considered as completely
heterogeneous (except when temperatures higher
than 4505008C are used). For less reactive
catalysts, temperatures higher than 5008C can
lead to thermal, uncatalyzed dehydrogenation of
the parafn followed by a catalyzed O-insertion
into the olen.
2. Nonredox metal oxide catalysts which are active
above 5008C and are employed for the oxidation of
methane and ethane. Under these conditions, the
reaction begins on the catalyst surface, with gen-
eration of alkyl radicals, which then react in the
homogeneous phase.
3. Noble metal-based catalysts which under particular
conditions (temperature higher than 7008C, very
low residence time) may become selective in
alkane oxidation. In this case, the mechanism also
occurs in part on the catalyst surface, in part in the
proximity of the catalyst surface, (in the boundary
layer) and in part in the gas phase.

<questions>


How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
