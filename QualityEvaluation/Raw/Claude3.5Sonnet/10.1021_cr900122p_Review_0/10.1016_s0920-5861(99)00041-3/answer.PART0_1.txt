[1] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are: [...] 1.1. the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6,7,11];"

[2] "1.1. the density of the active sites [3,9,10], which can be explained by the site isolation theory [23];"

[3] "Particular cases, which can be considered as intermediates between completely heterogeneous mechanisms and homogeneous reactions are those reactions which, even though they occur on redox-type catalytic systems, include a rst step which occurs in the gas phase."

[4] "The oxidation of n-butane and n-pentane over vanadyl pyrophosphate [...] In general, the fundamental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 as the active phase is recognized but it is generally believed that oxidized V5 sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: By spacing out active metal centers, unwanted side reactions are minimized, improving selectivity. This is explained by the "site isolation theory".

2. Adsorbed oxygen species: Isolated metal sites can activate oxygen to form reactive adsorbed species that participate in C-H activation.

3. Redox cycling: Isolated metal centers can undergo redox changes (e.g. V5+ to V4+) as part of the catalytic cycle, abstracting hydrogen from alkanes. 

4. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the oxide can be inserted into the alkane, with the reduced metal site then re-oxidized.

In the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride, vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) catalysts employ these principles:

- Isolated V5+ sites on the catalyst surface are believed to be the active centers
- A Mars-van Krevelen mechanism likely operates, with lattice oxygen inserting into butane
- Redox cycling between V5+ and V4+ occurs during the reaction
- Careful control of the V5+/V4+ ratio and oxygen availability is key for optimizing selectivity

The reaction may also involve some gas-phase steps in addition to surface reactions, making it an intermediate case between fully heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Overall, the isolated nature of the active sites and controlled redox properties are crucial for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 位点隔离：通过隔开活性金属中心，可以最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，从而提高选择性。这可以用"位点隔离理论"来解释。

2. 吸附氧物种：孤立的金属位点可以活化氧以形成参与C-H活化的活性吸附物种。

3. 氧化还原循环：孤立的金属中心可以作为催化循环的一部分发生氧化还原变化（例如V5+到V4+），从烷烃中提取氢。

4. Mars-van Krevelen机理：氧化物中的晶格氧可以插入烷烃中，然后还原的金属位点再次被氧化。

在丁烷工业转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程中，钒焦磷酸盐（(VO)2P2O7）催化剂采用了这些原理：

- 催化剂表面上的孤立V5+位点被认为是活性中心
- 可能存在Mars-van Krevelen机理，晶格氧插入丁烷
- 反应过程中V5+和V4+之间发生氧化还原循环
- 仔细控制V5+/V4+比例和氧的可用性是优化选择性的关键

该反应可能还涉及一些气相步骤和表面反应，使其成为完全多相和均相催化之间的中间情况。总的来说，活性位点的孤立性质和受控的氧化还原性质对于丁烷选择性氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐至关重要。
