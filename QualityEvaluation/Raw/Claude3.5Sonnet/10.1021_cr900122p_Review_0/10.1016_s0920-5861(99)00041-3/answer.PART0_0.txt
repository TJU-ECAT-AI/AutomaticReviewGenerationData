[1] "the site isolation theory, developed many years ago by Callahan and Grasselli [23], which claims the importance of having a statistically controlled number of surface oxidizing sites in order to favor selective oxidation reactions over combustion reactions."

[2] "the mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species). This occurs preferentially at lower temperatures (i.e. less than 4505008C for ethane, the temperature being a function of both (i) the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration, and (ii) the alkane reactivity)"

[5] "It is well known that the oxidation state of transition metal ions which constitute the active component of mixed oxide-based catalysts is a function of the operating conditions for the reaction, since the surface of the catalyst is in dynamic interaction with the gas phase [2,21]."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: Having a controlled number of isolated surface oxidizing sites favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

2. Heterogeneous mechanism: At lower temperatures (below 450-500°C), the reaction occurs through formation of intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species on the catalyst surface.

3. Redox properties: The reducibility and reoxidizability of active sites, as well as metal-oxygen bond strength, play a key role in C-H activation.

4. Dynamic interaction: The oxidation state of transition metal ions changes based on reaction conditions, as the catalyst surface interacts with the gas phase.

5. Structural defects: These can promote mobility of ionic species in the bulk, potentially aiding C-H activation.

In the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, both heterogeneous and homogeneous radical processes are believed to play important roles. The reaction likely begins with C-H activation on the catalyst surface, followed by further reactions that may involve both surface and gas-phase steps. The redox properties of the vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalyst, particularly the ability to cycle between different oxidation states, are crucial for this process. The catalyst's ability to provide oxygen for insertion into the hydrocarbon while maintaining selectivity is key to the reaction's success.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 位点隔离：控制表面氧化位点的数量有利于选择性氧化反应而非燃烧反应。

2. 多相机制：在较低温度下（450-500°C以下），反应通过在催化剂表面形成中间态烷氧基或烷基自由基物种进行。

3. 氧化还原性质：活性位点的可还原性和可再氧化性，以及金属-氧键强度在C-H活化中起关键作用。

4. 动态相互作用：过渡金属离子的氧化态根据反应条件变化，因为催化剂表面与气相相互作用。

5. 结构缺陷：这些可以促进体相中离子物种的迁移，可能有助于C-H活化。

在工业丁烷选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酐的过程中，多相和均相自由基过程都被认为起着重要作用。反应可能始于催化剂表面的C-H活化，随后的反应可能涉及表面和气相步骤。钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂的氧化还原性质，特别是在不同氧化态之间循环的能力，对这个过程至关重要。催化剂提供氧以插入碳氢化合物同时保持选择性的能力是反应成功的关键。
