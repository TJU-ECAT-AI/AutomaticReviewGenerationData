[1] "The general picture that can be drawn on the basis of the most important factors which are examined in these reviews clearly shows that the problem of parafn conversion and of selectivity to the desired product has to be solved within a complex framework of inter-related aspects."

[2] "1.1. the density of the active sites [3,9,10], which can be explained by the site isolation theory [23];"

[3] "2.1. the redox properties of the metal in transition metal oxide-based catalysts, in terms of reducibility and reoxidizability of the active sites, and the metaloxygen bond strength [3,5];"

[4] "It is well known that the oxidation state of transition metal ions which constitute the active component of mixed oxide-based catalysts is a function of the operating conditions for the reaction, since the surface of the catalyst is in dynamic interaction with the gas phase [2,21]."

[5] "Indeed, more oxidized surfaces usually result in more active but less selective catalysts, while the opposite is true for more reduced surfaces."

[6] "In general, the mechanism which operates is completely heterogeneous and includes the formation of an intermediate alkoxy species (or alkyl radical species)."

[7] "The oxygen species which are involved in the multi-electron transformation of n-butane are both bulk oxygen ions (even though probably limited to a few surface atomic layers) and chemisorbed species [9497]."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: The density and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface is crucial. Isolated metal centers prevent over-oxidation and improve selectivity.

2. Redox properties: The ability of the metal centers to cycle between oxidation states is key. This involves the reducibility and re-oxidizability of the active sites, as well as the metal-oxygen bond strength.

3. Dynamic interaction: The oxidation state of the metal centers changes based on reaction conditions, with more reduced surfaces generally being more selective.

4. Heterogeneous mechanism: The process typically involves formation of intermediate alkoxy or alkyl radical species on the catalyst surface.

5. Oxygen involvement: Both bulk lattice oxygen and chemisorbed oxygen species participate in the reaction.

For the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride, these principles are applied as follows:

- Vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts are used, with isolated V4+/V5+ sites.
- The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is believed to operate, where lattice oxygen is inserted into the hydrocarbon.
- The redox cycling between V4+ and V5+ is crucial for the reaction.
- Reaction conditions are controlled to maintain an optimal oxidation state of the catalyst surface.
- Both bulk and surface oxygen species are involved in the multi-electron oxidation process.

This approach allows for the selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride while minimizing complete combustion to CO2.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进了多相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. 位点隔离：催化剂表面活性位点的密度和分布至关重要。孤立的金属中心可防止过度氧化并提高选择性。

2. 氧化还原性质：金属中心在不同氧化态之间循环的能力是关键。这涉及活性位点的可还原性和可再氧化性，以及金属-氧键强度。

3. 动态相互作用：金属中心的氧化态会根据反应条件而变化，更还原的表面通常具有更高的选择性。

4. 多相机理：该过程通常涉及在催化剂表面形成中间体烷氧基或烷基自由基物种。

5. 氧的参与：晶格氧和化学吸附的氧物种都参与反应。

对于丁烷选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用，这些原理应用如下：

- 使用钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂，具有孤立的V4+/V5+位点。
- 据信反应遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧插入烃分子中。
- V4+和V5+之间的氧化还原循环对反应至关重要。
- 控制反应条件以维持催化剂表面的最佳氧化态。
- 体相和表面氧物种都参与多电子氧化过程。

这种方法允许丁烷选择性氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐，同时最大限度地减少完全燃烧生成CO2。
