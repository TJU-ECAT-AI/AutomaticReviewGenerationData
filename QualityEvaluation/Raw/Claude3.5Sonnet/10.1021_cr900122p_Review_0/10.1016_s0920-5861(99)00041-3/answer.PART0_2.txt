[1] "Examples of the points which have been considered as key factors in determining the pathway of alkane transformation to the product of selective oxidation are: [...] 1.1. the role of adsorbed oxygen species [14,6, 7,11];"

[2] "The surface of the catalyst: the nature of the active sites, and how the surface is affected by the bulk features and specifically: 1.1. the density of the active sites [3,9,10], which can be explained by the site isolation theory [23];"

[3] "It is well known that the oxidation state of transition metal ions which constitute the active component of mixed oxide-based catalysts is a function of the operating conditions for the reaction, since the surface of the catalyst is in dynamic interaction with the gas phase [2,21]."

[4] "The mechanism which operates in these cases usually involves a fundamental contribution of alkyl radical species which are generated at the catalyst surface"

[5] "The oxidation of n-butane and n-pentane over vanadyl pyrophosphate [...] In general, the fundamental role of the vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7 as the active phase is recognized but it is generally believed that oxidized V5+ sites, present as dispersed VOPO4 phases at the surface of the vanadyl pyrophosphate, or in the form of domains at the basal (100) face of (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in the formation of maleic anhydride."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Site isolation: The density and distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface is crucial. Isolated metal centers provide specific adsorption sites for reactants and control the selectivity of the reaction.

2. Redox properties: The oxidation state of transition metal ions in the catalyst is dynamic and interacts with the gas phase. This allows for controlled oxidation and reduction cycles.

3. Oxygen species: Adsorbed oxygen species on the isolated metal centers play a key role in C-H bond activation.

4. Radical formation: Alkyl radical species can be generated at the catalyst surface as intermediates.

For the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion, vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) catalysts are used industrially. The reaction involves:

1. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: Lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates in the oxidation.

2. Presence of both V4+ and V5+ sites: Oxidized V5+ sites, either as dispersed VOPO4 phases or domains on (VO)2P2O7, are directly involved in maleic anhydride formation.

3. Redox cycling: The catalyst undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the reaction cycle.

4. Controlled oxidation: The catalyst surface maintains a balance of oxidation states to achieve selectivity.

These principles allow for the selective oxidation of butane by controlling the C-H activation steps and subsequent oxidation pathways, ultimately leading to the desired maleic anhydride product.

在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过以下几种机制促进C-H键的活化：

1. 位点隔离：催化剂表面活性位点的密度和分布至关重要。孤立的金属中心为反应物提供特定的吸附位点，并控制反应的选择性。

2. 氧化还原性质：催化剂中过渡金属离子的氧化态是动态的，并与气相相互作用。这允许控制氧化和还原循环。

3. 氧物种：孤立金属中心上吸附的氧物种在C-H键活化中起关键作用。

4. 自由基形成：烷基自由基物种可以在催化剂表面生成作为中间体。

对于丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体工业应用实例，使用钒焦磷酸盐((VO)2P2O7)催化剂。反应涉及：

1. Mars-van Krevelen机理：催化剂中的晶格氧参与氧化过程。

2. 同时存在V4+和V5+位点：氧化的V5+位点，无论是以分散的VOPO4相还是(VO)2P2O7上的区域形式存在，都直接参与顺丁烯二酸酐的形成。

3. 氧化还原循环：催化剂在反应循环中经历还原和再氧化过程。

4. 受控氧化：催化剂表面保持氧化态的平衡以实现选择性。

这些原理通过控制C-H活化步骤和随后的氧化途径，最终导致所需的顺丁烯二酸酐产物，从而实现丁烷的选择性氧化。
