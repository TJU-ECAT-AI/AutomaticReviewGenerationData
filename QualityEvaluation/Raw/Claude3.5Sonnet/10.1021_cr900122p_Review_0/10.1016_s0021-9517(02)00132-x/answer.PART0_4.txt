The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The document focuses more broadly on zeolites as catalysts for various reactions, but does not go into detail on the specific processes and mechanisms asked about in the question.

给出的文献中没有具体涉及孤立金属中心对C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen或H-抽取等机理,以及烷烃工业选择性氧化(如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐)的相关信息。该文档更广泛地讨论了沸石作为各种反应的催化剂,但没有详细介绍问题中询问的具体过程和机理。
