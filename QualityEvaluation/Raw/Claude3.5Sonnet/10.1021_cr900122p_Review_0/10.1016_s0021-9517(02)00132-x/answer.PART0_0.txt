<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, or the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes such as butane to maleic anhydride. The document focuses more broadly on zeolites as catalysts, their acid-base properties, and some oxidation reactions, but does not go into detail on the specific mechanisms and industrial processes mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided text.

给定的科学文献并不包含关于孤立金属中心活化C-H键、Mars van Krevelen或H-抽取等机理,以及烷烃(如丁烷到马来酸酐)工业选择性氧化的具体信息。该文档更多地关注沸石作为催化剂的广泛应用,其酸碱性质,以及一些氧化反应,但没有详细讨论问题中提到的具体机理和工业过程。因此,仅基于所提供的文本无法充分回答这个问题。
