<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the question about isolated metal centers, C-H bond activation mechanisms, or industrial selective oxidation of alkanes. The text focuses more broadly on zeolites and their applications in acid, base, and redox catalysis, but does not go into detail about the specific mechanisms and industrial processes mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给的文献不包含具体涉及孤立金属中心、C-H键活化机制或烷烃工业选择性氧化的信息。文本更广泛地关注了沸石及其在酸、碱和氧化还原催化中的应用,但没有详细讨论问题中提到的具体机制和工业过程。因此,仅基于所给文献中提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。
