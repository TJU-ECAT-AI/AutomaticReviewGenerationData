The selective transformation of ubiquitous but inert CH bonds to other functional groups has far-reaching practical implications,
ranging from more efficient strategies for fine chemical synthesis to the replacement of current petrochemical feedstocks by less
expensive and more readily available alkanes. The past twenty years have seen many examples of CH bond activation at
transition-metal centres, often under remarkably mild conditions and with high selectivity. Although profitable practical
applications have not yet been developed, our understanding of how these organometallic reactions occur, and what their
inherent advantages and limitations for practical alkane conversion are, has progressed considerably. In fact, the recent
development of promising catalytic systems highlights the potential of organometallic chemistry for useful CH bond activation
strategies that will ultimately allow us to exploit Earths alkane resources more efficiently and cleanly.
A
lkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, are major constitu-
ents of natural gas and petroleum, but there are very few
practical processes for converting them directly to more
valuable products. The reason for this difficulty is
alluded to by their other name, paraffin (meaning
not enough affinity): alkanes are relatively inert. This chemical
inertness arises from the constituent atoms of alkanes all being held
together by strong and localized CC and CH bonds, so that the
molecules have no empty orbitals of low energy or filled orbitals of
high energy that could readily participate in a chemical reaction, as
is the case with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins and
alkynes.
Alkanes do react at high temperatures, as encountered in com-
bustion, but such reactions are not readily controllable and usually
proceed to the thermodynamically stable and economically un-
attractive products, carbon dioxide and water. The currently preva-
lent use of alkanes in combustion applications exploits their energy
content, but not their considerable potential as valuable precursors
for more important and expensive chemicals. Although cracking
and thermal dehydrogenation convert alkanes to valuable olefins,
these processes require high temperatures and are energy intensive.
Similarly, although alkanes can be induced to react by exposure to
highly reactive species such as superacids or free radicals, these
reactive species are usually demanding and expensive to make, and
offer little control over product selectivity.
A variety of enzymes efficiently and selectively catalyse alkane
oxidation at physiological temperatures and pressures, and the
direct use of biological organisms for industrial alkane conversion
under such benign conditions is possible in principle. But in
practice, these approaches may be primarily applicable to the
small-scale production of specialized chemicals, given that large-
scale bioprocesses for converting alkane resources seem to be
problematic1. However, despite their practical limitations, enzy-
matic alkane transformations are much studied, to understand the
underlying reaction mechanisms and guide the design of synthetic
catalysts mimicking the function, efficiency and selectivity of their
biological counterparts. Enzymatic and enzyme-mimetic alkane
transformations are beyond the scope of the present review, but
further information and bibliographies can be found in recent
reviews2,3.
Because it is difficult to achieve selective transformations under
forcing conditions, most important petrochemicals, especially oxy-
genates such as alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, are
produced from unsaturated hydrocarbons. The primary unsatu-
rated starting materials are olefins, in turn obtained from alkanes by
fairly inefficient processes. Milder and better-controlled direct
conversions of alkanes into olefins may thus offer large economic
benefits. Alkane chemistry could also improve the utilization of
methane, the principal component of natural gas. Many of the
worlds established natural gas resource locations are remote, in sites
where there is little or no local demand, such as the north slope of
Alaska. Exploitation of such resources is impeded by the high cost of
both gas transportation and current methods for converting hydro-
carbon gas into more readily transportable liquid4. The available
conversion methods are indirect, involving production of synthesis
gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), followed by conversion to
the desired product. Developing efficient strategies for the direct
conversion of methane to methanol or other liquid fuels or
chemicals could thus significantly improve methane utilization.
The controlled activation of small, relatively inert molecules has
been a ubiquitous theme in transition metal chemistry since its
renaissance began in the late 1950s. Practitioners of this art are thus
well placed to address the alkane activation problem. To date,
binding to metal centres has resulted in altered and/or enhanced
reactivity in a variety of molecules, through associated changes in
the relative energies of their orbitals or their polarity. Olefins and
carbon monoxide, for example, are rendered more susceptible to
nucleophilic attack upon coordination to a metal centre5, whereas
coordinated dioxygen frequently reacts with electrophiles6. Even
dinitrogen, the classic inert small molecule, can be thus activated
and induced to partake in chemical transformations7. In principle, it
should be possible to similarly activate the inert CH bonds of
alkanes, but the examples just mentioned all involve small molecules
with lone electron pairs and/or p orbitals that can interact with
empty orbitals of the metal centres; alkanes possess neither of these.
Indeed, in most pre-1980s examples of CH bonds reacting at
transition-metal centres, reactions proceed successfully only if they
are assisted through participation of the p orbitals of aromatic CH
bonds8 (equation (1)) or involve intramolecular reactions, where
the group containing the CH bond to be activated is already
attached to the metal9 (equation (2)). Often both effects contrib-
ute10 (equation (3)).

where hn implies light energy and D implies heat energy. Functional
groups are abbreviated as follows: Ph, phenyl; Et, ethyl; Me, methyl.
If such assistance were in fact required, activation of aliphatic C
H bonds at transition-metal centres would not be a good strategy for
catalytic alkane conversion. However, during the 1970s, examples of
significant interaction between a metal centre and an alkane CH
bond suggested that this difficulty might have been overestimated.
For example, some metal complexes were known to catalyse alkane
reactions such as hydrogendeuterium (HD) exchange or oxi-
dation under relatively mild conditions11. Moreover, several cases of
so-called agostic bonding were discovered12, wherein a CH bond of
an already coordinated ligand forms an additional bond to the metal
(see Fig. 1 for a typical example13).
These observations suggested that alkane activation should be
possible. In fact, chemists realized that previous failures to achieve it
might not have been due to unreactivity at all: CH activation might
take place, but yield an organometallic product that is thermo-
dynamically unstable and thus undetectable14. This interpretation
proved to be correct. Using systems designed to produce stable
products, two groups demonstrated intermolecular alkane acti-
vation in 1982 (refs 15, 16) (one reaction is shown in equation
(4)), and a large number of other examples quickly followed. (Ref.
17 provides a thorough survey of these developments and further
