Received 27th September, 1974 
The exchange behaviour of a series of alkanes, including cycloalkanes, with deuterium over y- 
alumina has been investigated. Different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule are 
found to exchange 
at different 
rates and in some cases a quantitative 
estimate of the relative activities 
has been made. These results and a comparison of reaction rates of different 
molecules indicate that 
the reaction 
intermediates 
are carbanionic 
in character. A linear relation between hydrogen 
exchange 
activity and hydrocarbon acidity has been obtained and is shown to be an example of the Brsnsted 
catalysis law. 
All the exchange reactions took place in a stepwise 
manner and, for the cycloalkanes, exchange 
could be followed at lower temperatures without complication from isomerization and addition. 
Recent results suggest that the intermediates in the exchange of butanes over 
y-alumina possess carbanionic character. The present work which involves the 
examination 
of the exchange 
reactions of a series of acyclic and cyclic alkanes seeks to 
relate rates of reaction to the stabilities of the carbanions formed from the respective 
molecules. 
Larson and Hall investigated the exchange reactions of methane over alumina. 
The reactions were catalyzed by a small number of active sites and involved exchange 
with only 1 % of the catalyst hydroxyl groups. Ethane is reported to exchange on 
alumina via a stepwise mehanism. 
Lewis acidity was found to be the property of 
the alumina catalyst which best correlated with its activity for the exchange of pro- 
pane.4 In addition, reducing centres on the surface played an essential role in the 
reaction. 
?-Alumina is reported to be an excellent catalyst for the exchange of cyclopro- 
pane. 
Isomerization and hydrogenation reactions are not extensive and the catalyst 
has been used to prepare [2H6]cyclopropane 
of high isotopic purity. 
In this work the exchange 
reactions of five acyclic and four cyclic alkanes 
have been 
studied. Information concerning reaction intermediates has been obtained not only 
from relative rates of exchange of the various reactants, but also from the reactivities 
of 
different types of hydrogen atoms within the same molecule. 
In previous work only one hydrocarbon has been investigated in any one experi- 
ment. An improved method involving combined gas chromatography-mass 
spectro- 
metry (g.c.-m.s.) 6 v  
has now been used and permits examination of the exchange of a 
series of reactants simultaneously. It has, therefore, been possible to obtain relative 
rates of exchange for different alkanes over the same catalyst sample, thereby elimin- 
ating possible problems of reproducibility of catalytic performance. In addition the 
exchange 
of cycloalkanes 
with deuterium may readily be studied even if other reactions 
take place. Using g.c.-m.s. the processes of addition, exchange and isomerization 
may be followed simultaneously.

ALKANE EXCHANGE O N  ALUMINA 
EXPERIMENTAL 
A P P A R A T U S  AND PROCEDURE 
Exchange reactions involving a single reactant were followed in a conventional manner 
using a direct capillary leak from the reaction vessel to an A.E.I. MSlO mass spectrometer. 
Mass spectral 
analyses of the hydrocarbon products were carried out for the parent ions using 
an electron beam of energy 10eV. With the exception of experiments involving cyclo- 
propane and methylcyclopropane when 0.1 g samples of catalyst were used the usual pro- 
cedure was to treat 1 
.O g y-alumina in oxygen at 723 K prior to evacuation at this temperature 
for at least 15 h. The reaction mixture usually consisted of 0.96 kN m-2 hydrocarbon and 
9.5 kN m-' deuterium 
in a silica reaction vessel, giving ca. 3 x 1019 
molecules of hydrocarbon 
in the reaction vessel. Exceptions to these proportions are indicated in the Results section. 
In experiments involving more than one reactant hydrocarbon or in those in which a 
single reactant could exhibit different reactions, the standard mass spectrometric method 
proved inadequate. In such cases the combined g.c.-m.s. apparatus linked to an " 
on-line " 
computer 6 v  
was employed. Separation of acyclic alkanes was achieved using an 8 m 
column of bis-2-methoxyethyl adipate (13.5 %) and di-2ethylhexyl sebacate (6.5 %) on 
60/80 mesh Chromosorb P, operating at 273 K for C1 
to C3 
alkanes and at room temperature 
for higher alkanes. Cycloalkanes 
and their isornerization products were separated on a 
4 m 
column of propylene carbonate on 60/80 mesh Chromosorb P operating at 273 K. This 
column was also used to separate the components of the cyclobutane and n-butane mixture. 
For experiments followed by g.c.-ms., the reaction mixtures were chosen to give approxi- 
mately the same number (3 x 1019) 
of hydrocarbon molecules and the same total pressure in 
the reaction system as for those experiments followed by mass spectrometry alone. The 
catalyst received the same pretreatment. 
The method of data acquisition was identical to that described previously ' 
except that 
the use of reference 
masses 18,28 and 32 proved inadequate for the accurate analysis of mass 
spectra of C3 
and C4 alkanes. It was found necessary to employ reference masses such that 
the mass range of interest was included, thereby permitting mass numbers to be assigned by 
an interpolation method. Two techniques were available for the production of suitable

How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
