How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain sufficient detailed information to fully answer the question about how isolated metal centers facilitate C-H bond activation, specific mechanisms involved, or the application to industrial selective oxidation of alkanes like butane to maleic anhydride. 

The document mentions some relevant concepts like the isolation of vanadium ions, multifunctionality in catalyst design and reaction mechanisms, and C-H bond activation. However, it lacks specifics on how these relate to heterogeneous catalysis mechanisms or industrial applications.

Without more context from the full text, it's not possible to provide a comprehensive answer about the role of isolated metal centers, Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, or details about butane to maleic anhydride conversion based solely on the excerpt given.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献不包含足够详细的信息来全面回答关于孤立金属中心如何促进C-H键活化、涉及的具体机制,或在工业选择性氧化烷烃(如丁烷制顺丁烯二酐)中的应用等问题。

该文件提到了一些相关概念,如钒离子的隔离、催化剂设计和反应机理中的多功能性,以及C-H键活化。然而,它缺乏关于这些概念如何与多相催化机理或工业应用相关的具体内容。

如果没有全文的更多上下文,仅凭所给的摘录无法提供关于孤立金属中心的作用、Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机制,或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐的详细信息的全面答案。

The document also does not discuss the application of these principles to industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane conversion to maleic anhydride.

However, the literature does mention some relevant concepts that may be related to the question:

1. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix is discussed as an important aspect of catalyst design for selective oxidation of paraffins.

2. Multifunctionality is highlighted as both a criterion in catalyst design and a tool to explain reaction mechanisms for these types of reactions.

3. The type of C-H bond activation is mentioned as a key factor, though specifics are not provided.

Without more detailed information from the text, it is not possible to fully answer the question about the specific mechanisms and industrial applications of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

这篇文献并未提供关于氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心如何促进异相催化中C-H键活化的具体细节，也没有讨论所涉及的机制，如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提。文献也没有讨论这些原理在工业烷烃选择性氧化中的应用，或者丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子。

然而，文献确实提到了一些可能与问题相关的概念：

1. 讨论了钒离子在准惰性基质中的隔离是设计选择性氧化烷烃催化剂的一个重要方面。

2. 强调了多功能性既是催化剂设计的标准，也是解释这类反应机理的工具。

3. 提到C-H键活化的类型是一个关键因素，但没有提供具体细节。

由于文本中没有更详细的信息，无法完全回答关于孤立金属中心C-H键活化的具体机制和工业应用的问题。
