[1] "Catalysts based on transition metal oxides [ 15-23 ]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [ 12,15 ], and yield ethylene with high productivity and good selectivity."

[2] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]."

[3] "Mg3(VO4): (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[4] "Nb205 itself is a selective catalyst, and the addition of vanadium improves the activity while maintaining the selectivity high. The active sites are assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions improve the selectivity."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: This involves lattice oxygen from the catalyst participating in the oxidation reaction. The metal center is reduced as it donates oxygen, then re-oxidized by gas phase oxygen. 

2. H-abstraction: The metal center can abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a radical species.

3. Redox cycling: As mentioned for vanadium oxide catalysts, the metal center undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes in several ways:

- Using oxides with isolated metal sites, like vanadium spread on magnesium oxide, to prevent over-oxidation
- Combining metals like V and Nb to balance activity and selectivity
- Utilizing lattice oxygen for selective oxidation before re-oxidation from gas phase

For butane to maleic anhydride conversion specifically, vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts are typically used industrially. The isolated vanadium sites and lattice oxygen participate in the selective oxidation steps. However, this specific example is not discussed in detail in the given text.

The key is to design catalysts with the right balance of isolated active sites to activate the C-H bond selectively, while preventing over-oxidation to CO2. The oxide support and any promoters play a crucial role in tuning this selectivity.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心可以通过几种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制：这涉及催化剂中的晶格氧参与氧化反应。金属中心在提供氧时被还原，然后被气相氧重新氧化。

2. H-抽取：金属中心可以从烷烃中抽取氢原子，形成自由基物种。

3. 氧化还原循环：如钒氧化物催化剂所述，金属中心在催化循环过程中经历还原和再氧化。

这些原理在工业烷烃选择性氧化中的应用包括：

- 使用具有孤立金属位点的氧化物，如分散在氧化镁上的钒，以防止过度氧化
- 结合金属如V和Nb，平衡活性和选择性
- 利用晶格氧进行选择性氧化，然后从气相重新氧化

特别是对于丁烷到马来酸酐的转化，工业上通常使用钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂。孤立的钒位点和晶格氧参与选择性氧化步骤。然而，给定的文本中并未详细讨论这个具体例子。

关键是设计具有适当平衡的孤立活性位点的催化剂，以选择性地活化C-H键，同时防止过度氧化成CO2。氧化物载体和任何助剂在调节这种选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing isolated metal centers on oxide materials for C-H bond activation, mechanisms like Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction, or the industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. The document focuses mainly on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to produce light olefins, discussing various catalysts and reaction conditions for these processes. It does not provide relevant details about the specific mechanisms of C-H activation or the butane to maleic anhydride conversion process.

[1] "Mg3(VO4)2 (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[2] "Isolation of oxidizing sites is realized by dispersion of vanadium ions inside matrixes catalytically inert, such as zeolites or zeolitic-like compounds. V-silicalite exhibits relatively high yields, but low productivity; in VAPO-5 isolated VO4 tetrahedron structures have been proposed to be the active and selective sites in paraffins oxydehydrogenation."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing specific active sites for the reaction to occur. The literature mentions two examples of this:

1. Isolated VO4 units spread over MgO in Mg3(VO4)2 catalysts are considered to be highly active and selective for n-butane oxydehydrogenation. These isolated units are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbons, which helps prevent the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that can lead to undesired COx formation.

2. Isolated VO4 tetrahedron structures in zeolites or zeolitic-like compounds, such as V-silicalite and VAPO-5, are proposed to be active and selective sites for paraffin oxydehydrogenation.

The literature does not explicitly discuss the Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms in relation to these isolated metal centers. Additionally, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not mentioned in the given text.

While the document provides some insights into how isolated metal centers can facilitate C-H bond activation, it does not provide comprehensive information on the mechanisms involved or the industrial application to butane-to-maleic anhydride conversion. More detailed information would be required to fully address all aspects of the question.

在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供特定的活性位点来促进C-H键的活化。文献中提到了两个例子：

1. 在Mg3(VO4)2催化剂中，分散在MgO上的孤立VO4单元被认为对正丁烷氧化脱氢具有高活性和选择性。这些孤立单元不会在活化的烃类上插入氧，这有助于防止形成含氧烃类，从而避免产生不需要的COx。

2. 在沸石或类沸石化合物（如V-硅石和VAPO-5）中的孤立VO4四面体结构被认为是烷烃氧化脱氢的活性和选择性位点。

文献并未明确讨论与这些孤立金属中心相关的Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。此外，文中也没有提到丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。

虽然该文档提供了一些关于孤立金属中心如何促进C-H键活化的见解，但它并未提供有关所涉及机制或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用的全面信息。要全面回答所有问题的各个方面，需要更详细的信息。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the mechanisms involved, and the application to industrial selective oxidation of alkanes using butane to maleic anhydride conversion as an example. However, the document does provide some relevant information about catalytic processes involving metal oxides and isolated metal centers:

1. Transition metal oxides, particularly vanadium oxide-based systems, can activate hydrocarbons through a classical redox cycle. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400°C in a heterogeneous reaction controlled by the catalyst.

2. Isolated metal centers, such as VO4 units in Mg3(VO4)2 spread over MgO, are considered to be active and selective for n-butane oxydehydrogenation. These isolated units are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbons, which helps prevent the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that are precursors to COx formation.

3. In V/Nb/O catalysts, vanadium ions in the form of small clusters are assumed to be the active sites, while neighboring surface Nb ions improve selectivity.

While these points provide some insight into the role of isolated metal centers and oxide materials in catalytic processes, they do not fully address the specific mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) or the industrial application to butane-to-maleic anhydride conversion as requested in the question.

该文献没有全面回答关于孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化、涉及的机理(如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提)以及这些原理如何应用于烷烃工业选择性氧化(以丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐为具体例子)的具体问题。然而,该文档确实提供了一些关于涉及金属氧化物和孤立金属中心的催化过程的相关信息:

1. 过渡金属氧化物,特别是钒氧化物基系统,可以通过经典的氧化还原循环活化碳氢化合物。这些系统可以在低至400°C的温度下活化乙烷,整个反应是异相的,因此由催化剂控制。

2. 孤立的金属中心,如分散在MgO上的Mg3(VO4)2中的VO4单元,被认为对正丁烷的氧化脱氢具有活性和选择性。这些孤立单元在活化的碳氢化合物上不活跃于氧的插入,这有助于防止含氧碳氢化合物(COx形成的前体)的生成。

3. 在V/Nb/O催化剂中,以小簇形式存在的钒离子被认为是活性位点,而相邻的表面Nb离子可以提高选择性。

虽然这些要点提供了一些关于孤立金属中心和氧化物材料在催化过程中作用的见解,但它们并没有完全解决问题中要求的具体机理(如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提)或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用。

The literature provides some insights into how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, though it does not directly address all aspects of the question:

1. Isolated metal centers, such as VO4 units in magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3(VO4)2), can activate C-H bonds without promoting further oxidation to COx. This suggests that isolated centers can selectively activate C-H bonds without over-oxidizing the products.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is implied in the description of vanadium oxide-based systems, where the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon through a redox cycle. This indicates that lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates in the reaction.

3. While not explicitly mentioned, H-abstraction is likely involved in the C-H activation process, particularly for catalysts operating at higher temperatures.

4. The literature does not provide a specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it does mention n-butane oxydehydrogenation over magnesium orthovanadate catalysts, which could be considered a related process.

5. In industrial applications, the principles of isolated active sites and redox mechanisms are utilized to achieve selective oxidation. For example, the use of mixed metal oxides (like V/Nb/O catalysts) where vanadium ions form small clusters, and neighboring surface Nb ions improve selectivity, demonstrates how these principles are applied to enhance catalyst performance.

The document does not provide comprehensive information on all aspects of the question, particularly regarding the specific industrial example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it does offer insights into the general principles of C-H activation and selective oxidation in heterogeneous catalysis using isolated metal centers on oxide materials.

该文献对于孤立金属中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化提供了一些见解，尽管它并未直接涉及问题的所有方面：

1. 孤立的金属中心，如镁正钒酸盐(Mg3(VO4)2)中的VO4单元，可以活化C-H键而不促进进一步氧化成COx。这表明孤立中心可以选择性地活化C-H键而不会过度氧化产物。

2. 文中描述钒氧化物基系统时暗示了Mars-van Krevelen机理，即催化剂通过氧化还原循环与烃类相互作用而被还原。这表明催化剂的晶格氧参与了反应。

3. 虽然没有明确提到，但H-抽取可能涉及C-H活化过程，特别是对于在较高温度下操作的催化剂。

4. 文献没有提供丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。然而，它确实提到了在镁正钒酸盐催化剂上进行正丁烷氧化脱氢，这可以被认为是一个相关过程。

5. 在工业应用中，孤立活性位点和氧化还原机理的原理被用于实现选择性氧化。例如，使用混合金属氧化物（如V/Nb/O催化剂），其中钒离子形成小簇，而相邻的表面Nb离子改善选择性，这展示了如何应用这些原理来提高催化剂性能。

该文档并未提供问题所有方面的全面信息，特别是关于丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体工业示例。然而，它确实提供了关于多相催化中使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行C-H活化和选择性氧化的一般原理的见解。
