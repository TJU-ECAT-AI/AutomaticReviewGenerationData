[1] "Catalysts based on transition metal oxides [ 15-23 ]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [ 12,15 ], and yield ethylene with high productivity and good selectivity."

[2] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]."

[3] "Mg3(VO4): (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[4] "Nb205 itself is a selective catalyst, and the addition of vanadium improves the activity while maintaining the selectivity high. The active sites are assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions improve the selectivity."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis through several mechanisms:

1. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: This involves lattice oxygen from the catalyst participating in the oxidation reaction. The metal center is reduced as it donates oxygen, then re-oxidized by gas phase oxygen. 

2. H-abstraction: The metal center can abstract a hydrogen atom from the alkane, forming a radical species.

3. Redox cycling: As mentioned for vanadium oxide catalysts, the metal center undergoes reduction and re-oxidation during the catalytic cycle.

These principles are applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes in several ways:

- Using oxides with isolated metal sites, like vanadium spread on magnesium oxide, to prevent over-oxidation
- Combining metals like V and Nb to balance activity and selectivity
- Utilizing lattice oxygen for selective oxidation before re-oxidation from gas phase

For butane to maleic anhydride conversion specifically, vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts are typically used industrially. The isolated vanadium sites and lattice oxygen participate in the selective oxidation steps. However, this specific example is not discussed in detail in the given text.

The key is to design catalysts with the right balance of isolated active sites to activate the C-H bond selectively, while preventing over-oxidation to CO2. The oxide support and any promoters play a crucial role in tuning this selectivity.

氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心可以通过几种机制促进异相催化中的C-H键活化：

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制：这涉及催化剂中的晶格氧参与氧化反应。金属中心在提供氧时被还原，然后被气相氧重新氧化。

2. H-抽取：金属中心可以从烷烃中抽取氢原子，形成自由基物种。

3. 氧化还原循环：如钒氧化物催化剂所述，金属中心在催化循环过程中经历还原和再氧化。

这些原理在工业烷烃选择性氧化中的应用包括：

- 使用具有孤立金属位点的氧化物，如分散在氧化镁上的钒，以防止过度氧化
- 结合金属如V和Nb，平衡活性和选择性
- 利用晶格氧进行选择性氧化，然后从气相重新氧化

特别是对于丁烷到马来酸酐的转化，工业上通常使用钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂。孤立的钒位点和晶格氧参与选择性氧化步骤。然而，给定的文本中并未详细讨论这个具体例子。

关键是设计具有适当平衡的孤立活性位点的催化剂，以选择性地活化C-H键，同时防止过度氧化成CO2。氧化物载体和任何助剂在调节这种选择性方面起着至关重要的作用。
