alternative way for the production of light olefins

Abstract 
The main aspects of ethane and propane oxydehydrogenation are discussed. The performance of the various catalysts described 
in the literature has been compared. 
I. Introduction 
The demand for olefins and products made from 
olefins is increasing, and the existing capacity 
might become insufficient to meet this demand. 
Until recently, light olefins (along with methane 
and aromatics) have been obtained from steam 
cracking of natural gas and of naphtha and from 
FCC in oil refining. These established processes 
are extremely capital-intensive; the products have 
to be separated and purified for use in downstream 
plants that require fairy pure feedstocks, and the 
supply and demand for each coproduct are rarely 
in balance. Consequently, the incremental future 
demand for olefins might be satisfied by direct 
productions of individual or specific cuts of olefins 
by selective processes. In addition, integration of 
these plants with downstream olefin conversion 
plants can be advantageous in many cases [ 1 
]. 
Commercial processes for the synthesis of light 
olefins through paraffins dehydrogenation are 
available, even though their main application is 
for isobutene synthesis. In the case of propane, a 
couple of plants are on service, while in the case 
of ethane thermodynamic constraints would force

to operate at impracticable temperatures. The 
commercial catalytic dehydrogenation processes 
suffer from several limitations, especially: i) ther- 
modynamic limitations on paraffin conversion; ii) 
side reactions such as thermal cracking; iii) 
strongly endothermic reactions to which large 
amounts of heat must be supplied at temperatures 
above the reaction temperature; iv) formation of 
coke on the catalyst which requires frequent 
regeneration. With the goal of overcoming these 
limitations, research is proceeding along some 
directions, of which the following are the most 
likely to be implemented: i) optimization of cur- 
rent dehydrogenation 
technologies, to obtain more 
selective, stable and environmentally safe cata- 
lysts and lower investments and utility costs; ii) 
dehydrogenation coupled with hydrogen oxida- 
tion, to supply the heat of reaction inside the cat- 
alytic bed while avoiding overheating and to shift 
the equilibrium toward the desired products; iii) 
oxidative dehydrogenation, to overcome thermo- 
dynamic limitations, operate at low temperature 
with an exothermic reaction, and avoid frequent 
catalyst regeneration; iv) membrane-assisted 
dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation,

to obtain high conversion at low temperatures and 
to conduct the reactions and separations in the 
same equipment. 
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation 
Oxidative dehydrogenation takes place in the 
presence of an hydrogen acceptor such as molec- 
ular oxygen in the reaction medium. This process 
has the potential to overcome the major technical 
problems associated with pure dehydrogenation. 
However, other problems arise, related to the 
removal of the heat of reaction, control of selec- 
tivity due to the formation of undesired oxygen- 
ated by-products 
and carbon 
oxides, 
the 
flammability of the reaction mixtures, the possi- 
bility of run-away of the reaction. No commercial 
plants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light 
paraffins are believed to be currently operational, 
although pilot or demonstration plants have been 
built and operated. A great variety of catalysts 
have been formulated and tested [ 1-42]. Curi- 
ously, best catalytic systems for ethane oxydehy- 
drogenation are not the optimal ones for higher 
paraffins, and vice versa. This is likely due to the 
fact that the different features of both reactant 
paraffins and formed olefins make the mechanism 
of olefin formation and degradation different in 
the two cases. 
2.1. Oxydehydrogenation of ethane 
Some of the catalysts developed for the reaction 
of methane coupling are also active in the ethane 
oxydehydrogenation. In other cases, entirely new 
catalytic systems have been developed. The per- 
formances of catalysts reported in literature is 
summarized in Figs. 1 and 2, which report the 
highest achieved yields in a selectivity vs. con- 
version plot, and the levels of maximum produc- 
tivity 
obtained 
at 
the 
average 
operative 
temperature for each system. 
Generally, we can classify the catalysts into:

ane coupling [ 2-10] ; these activate ethane at tem- 
peratures usually higher than 600C to form ethyl 
radicals, which then further react in the gas phase. 
The most successful of these catalysts is the Li/ 
Mg/O one. The mechanism does not involve a 
classical redox-type cycle; thus, no furnishing of 
bulk oxygen occurs, and the catalyst only is 
involved in C-H heterolytic scission with radical 
formation, analogously to that occurring with 
methane. The role of the generation of Li +-O- 
centers capable of abstracting a H. and forming 
the ethyl radical. However, a progressive loss of 
Li occurs at temperatures higher than 700C. Such 
catalysts could be employed after a methane couS 
piing reactor, in order to increase the yield to eth- 
ylene through oxydehydrogenation of formed 
ethane. Catalysts for coupling operate at 700- 
800C, and the hot outlet stream could be fed to a 
downstream catalytic or thermal oxydehydrogen- 
ation reactor. 
High selectivities and yields to ethylene can be 
achieved with this catalytic system, above all 
when chlorine-containing 
compounds are also fed 
to the reactor, or when the catalyst is doped with 
halides [9,10] ; the promoter effect is maintained 
by continuous feeding of the chlorine, which mod- 
ifies the catalyst surface [ 11 ] ; chlorine radicals 
are thought to favour the homogeneous decom- 
position of ethyl radicals to ethylene. Yields as 
high as 34% to ethylene could be achieved [ 3,10] ; 
however, the use of chlorine is limited by prob- 
lems related to equipment corrosion. 
The selectivity to ethylene is increased with 
temperature; this is due to the fact that the formed 
ethyl radical at high temperature (600-700C; 
above 700C homogeneous overoxidation of eth- 
ylene decreases the selectivity) desorbs and forms 
ethylene in the gas phase via reaction with molec- 
ular oxygen; the high stability of ethylene and the 
contribution of the heterogeneously-initiated 
homogeneous reactions lead to the observed high 
selectivity. At lower temperatures the formation 
of a surface ethoxy species is preferred, precursor 
of COx formation. 
A further aspect of this system is the formation 
of H2 under oxidative conditions [7,12]. H2 can 
be formed either via thermal or catalyzed dehy- 
drogenation; also, a contribution was proposed 
due to water gas shift equilibrium (over rare earth 
oxides) or of intermediate ethoxy species decom- 
position to CO, C and H2. Recently [ 13 ], it was 
found that catalysts like Ca/Ni/K/O and Li/Mg/ 
O are active in the water gas shift at the tempera- 
tures at which ethane oxydehydrogenation 
occurs. 
Other systems that are active at temperatures 
higher than 600C are Li20/TiO2, LiC1/NiO, 
LiC1/MnO2 and LiC1/Sm203. Dopants other than 
Li + have been reported: SnO2, Na20, lanthanides 
(mainly CeO2) [ 14]. 
b) Catalysts based on transition metal oxides 
[ 15-23 ]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active 
[ 12,15 ], and yield ethylene with high productiv- 
ity and good selectivity. In addition, they exhibit 
a very high stability even at high temperature. 
Doping Sm203 
with alkali metals gives the best 
performances. These systems are believed to oper- 
ate with a mechanism similar to that of Li/Mg/O 
catalysts. 
Also Na4P2OT/MnOx/SiO2 catalyst operates at 
very high temperature; such system is claimed for 
cyclic operation with ARCO [ 16] or Phillips [ 17] 
technology in circulating-bed applications, where 
higher selectivities are achieved by dividing the 
reaction into two stages: i) oxydehydrogenation 
of the paraffin in the absence of molecular oxygen 
and ii) regeneration of the catalyst by treatment 
with air. 
In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst 
is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, 
through a classical redox cycle [ 18-23]. These 
systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low 
as 400C, and the entire reaction is heterogeneous, 
hence controlled by the catalyst; the contribution 
of homogeneous 
reactions only occurs at the high- 
est temperatures. Mixed oxides of Mo/V/Nb 
were shown to be active in ethane oxidation at 
temperatures as low as 250C, with selectivity to 
ethylene higher than 80%. However, the reported 
experimental conditions lead to an ethylene pro- 
ductivity which appears to be too low to have 
practical application. Mo/V/Nb/O also forms 
considerable amounts of acetic acid. Alumina-

2.2. Oxydehydrogenation 
of 
propane 
Most catalysts described in the literature are 
based on vanadium oxides as the main component 
[24-38]; particular attention has been given to 
the magnesium vanadates. A summary of the cat- 
alytic performance described in literature is given 
in Figs. 4 and 5. 
A general feature of most catalytic systems is 
that the selectivity to propylene is decreased on 
increasing the propane conversion (Fig. 6). This 
is likely due to the presence of labile allylic hydro- 
gen atoms in the formed propylene which acts as 
a center for consecutive oxidative attacks." This 
conversion 
/ selectivity 
trade-off 
is one of the main 
differences between ethane and propane (as well 
as other higher paraffins).

Recently [32], it has been pointed out that the 
non-catalyzed thermal oxidative pyrolysis of pro- 
pane gives an overall yield to olefins (ethylene 
and propylene, approximately 1 
/ 1 
) in a quartz 
apparatus higher than that achieved by whichever 
catalytic system, and at a temperature only 50-- 
100 degrees higher than that usually employed for 
the catalyzed reaction. This makes doubtful 
whether is really advantageous to develop a cata- 
lyst for this reaction. However, it has to be pointed 
out that in the author's apparatus the operating 
mechanism is a surface-initiated homogeneous 
reaction. Other authors have pointed out that 
higher yields to propylene can be achieved with a 
post-catalytic homogeneous reaction [ 34]. 
The following is a summary of the catalytic 
performances of the various systems. 
a) V205 is not a good catalytic system for the 
paraffins oxydehydrogenation, but the spreading 
of the oxide onto a support with basic features 
(such as sepiolite) or over alumina, with the for- 
mation of centers with peculiar 
chemical-physical 
features and reactivity lead to a more selective 
catalyst [ 
25,29]. Oxygenated compounds are not 
formed. These catalysts are active at relatively low 
temperature (in the 350-450C range); however, 
selectivity not higher 
than 40% were obtained, and 
only at low levels of conversion, with low overall 
productivity and yield (not higher than 8-9%). 
b) Mg/V/O catalysts have been the object of 
several investigations in recent years. This system 
is active in the 500-600C temperature range, and 
with respect to V205 are characterized by 
improved basicity and surface area [26-28,30- 
33]. This catalyst also leads to the formation of 
oxygenated by-products. Selectivity to propylene 
as high as 60% can be reached, with yields of 20% 
and fairly high productivity. The selectivity gen- 
erally decreases with conversion. 
Some disagreement 
exists in literature about the 
nature of the preferred structure, exhibiting the 
best catalytic performance. The published results 
can be summarized as follows: 
- 
Mg3(VO4): (Mg orthovanadate) spread 
over MgO is considered by some authors to 
be the most active and selective composition

was instead much less sensitive to the cata- 
lyst structure), due to the presence of iso- 
lated VO4 units which are not active in 
oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon 
(oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of 
COx formation) [ 
26-28,33 ]. 
- 
Mg2VzO 
7 (Mg pyrovanadate) was reported 
to exhibit a superior catalytic performance 
in terms of selectivity; the scale of selectivity 
was consistent with the vanadates redox 
properties: the highest the cation reducibility 
(the redox couple V 
4/V 5+ is supposed to 
be the one catalytically operating), the high- 
est the selectivity [ 30,31 ]. 
Indeed, it is likely that factors other than the 
crystalline structure of the vanadates can contrib- 
ute in affecting the catalytic performance, i.e.: i) 
the presence of small undetected amounts of V205 
(the preparation of pure reference 
phases is indeed 
a hard task); ii) the presence of alkali metals 
impurities coming from the raw materials 
employed for the preparation; iii)the surface 
enrichment in either magnesium or vanadium; iv) 
particle size and morphology, which can be 
affected by the thermal treatment; v) the method 
of preparation employed. 
c) V/Nb/O catalysts operate at 380--450C; 
they exhibit good productivity to propylene and 
apparently no formation of oxygenates [ 
35-37 ]. 
Nb205 itself 
is a selective 
catalyst, and the addition 
of vanadium improves the activity while main- 
taining the selectivity high. The active sites are 
assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small 
clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions 
improve the selectivity. Selectivities as high as 
90% could be reached at low propane conversion 
in samples prepared by 'melt method' (solid state 
reaction between NH4VO 
3 and hydrated niobia). 
d) Metal-zeolites [ 38,39] ; isolation of oxidiz- 
ing sites is realized 
by dispersion of vanadium ions 
inside matrixes catalytically inert, such as zeolites 
or zeolitic-like compounds. V-silicalite exhibits 
relatively high yields, but low productivity; in 
VAPO-5 isolated VO4 tetrahedron structures have 
been proposed to be the active and selective sites 
in paraffins oxydehydrogenation. 
e) Molybdates. Bismuth molybdates and van- 
adomolybdates are known to successfully operate 
in the oxidation and ammoxidation of propane to 
acrolein, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile [40]. 
Nickel molybdates exhibit a very high activity, 
with 60% selectivity to propylene; oxygenated 
products also form [41 ]. Magnesium molybdates 
are claimed by Dow Chem. Co. for butane oxy- 
dehydrogenation in two steps, with 80% overall 
yield to butadiene plus butenes [42]. 
3. Conclusions 
The problem of propylene stability towards 
consecutive unselective oxidative attack makes 
the finding of a suitable catalyst for propane oxy- 
dehydrogenation 
a hard task: several systems have 
been found that can activate the Paraffin, but not 
one able to save the formed olefin. It is likely that 
best conditions might come from the coupling of 
i) an heterogeneous system able to activate pro- 
pane at (relatively) high temperature, and ii) an 
homogeneous decomposition of desorbed radical 
species to propylene; in fact, low temperatures 
favour the surface-catalyzed further oxidation of 
propylene. This happens because the activation 
energy for the gas-phase dehydrogenation is 
higher than that one for the heterogeneous com- 
bustion. 
In the case of ethane oxydehydrogenation, a 
surface-initiated, homogeneous mechanism leads 
to high selectivities to ethylene. The possibility of 
development of a process competitive to the 
steam-cracking of ethane likely depends on the 
development of stable catalytic systems able to 
operate in the absence of corrosive or toxic gas- 
phase promoters, giving the olefin with high selec- 
tivity and acceptable productivity. However, it is 
obvious that hard operating conditions (more 
favourable to the selectivity) might render the 
paraffin oxydehydrogenation less competitive 
with the other conventional processes. The mini- 
mization of CO, the most difficult by-product to 
separate, is also an important task.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, what mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) are involved in these processes, and how are these principles applied in industrial selective oxidation of alkanes, using the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride as a specific example?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
