[1] "Catalysts based on transition metal oxides [15-23]. Rare earth oxides are remarkably active [12,15], and yield ethylene with high productivity and good selectivity."

[2] "In vanadium oxide-based systems the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon, through a classical redox cycle [18-23]. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400C, and the entire reaction is heterogeneous, hence controlled by the catalyst;"

[3] "Mg3(VO4)2 (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[4] "Nb2O5 itself is a selective catalyst, and the addition of vanadium improves the activity while maintaining the selectivity high. The active sites are assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions improve the selectivity."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the mechanisms involved, and the application to industrial selective oxidation of alkanes using butane to maleic anhydride conversion as an example. However, the document does provide some relevant information about catalytic processes involving metal oxides and isolated metal centers:

1. Transition metal oxides, particularly vanadium oxide-based systems, can activate hydrocarbons through a classical redox cycle. These systems can activate ethane at temperatures as low as 400°C in a heterogeneous reaction controlled by the catalyst.

2. Isolated metal centers, such as VO4 units in Mg3(VO4)2 spread over MgO, are considered to be active and selective for n-butane oxydehydrogenation. These isolated units are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbons, which helps prevent the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that are precursors to COx formation.

3. In V/Nb/O catalysts, vanadium ions in the form of small clusters are assumed to be the active sites, while neighboring surface Nb ions improve selectivity.

While these points provide some insight into the role of isolated metal centers and oxide materials in catalytic processes, they do not fully address the specific mechanisms (such as Mars van Krevelen and H-abstraction) or the industrial application to butane-to-maleic anhydride conversion as requested in the question.

该文献没有全面回答关于孤立金属中心如何促进多相催化中C-H键活化、涉及的机理(如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提)以及这些原理如何应用于烷烃工业选择性氧化(以丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐为具体例子)的具体问题。然而,该文档确实提供了一些关于涉及金属氧化物和孤立金属中心的催化过程的相关信息:

1. 过渡金属氧化物,特别是钒氧化物基系统,可以通过经典的氧化还原循环活化碳氢化合物。这些系统可以在低至400°C的温度下活化乙烷,整个反应是异相的,因此由催化剂控制。

2. 孤立的金属中心,如分散在MgO上的Mg3(VO4)2中的VO4单元,被认为对正丁烷的氧化脱氢具有活性和选择性。这些孤立单元在活化的碳氢化合物上不活跃于氧的插入,这有助于防止含氧碳氢化合物(COx形成的前体)的生成。

3. 在V/Nb/O催化剂中,以小簇形式存在的钒离子被认为是活性位点,而相邻的表面Nb离子可以提高选择性。

虽然这些要点提供了一些关于孤立金属中心和氧化物材料在催化过程中作用的见解,但它们并没有完全解决问题中要求的具体机理(如Mars van Krevelen和H-抽提)或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用。
