[3] "Mg3(VO4): (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[4] "The active sites are assumed to be vanadium ions in the form of small clusters, and neighbouring surface Nb ions improve the selectivity."

The literature provides some insights into how isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, though it does not directly address all aspects of the question:

1. Isolated metal centers, such as VO4 units in magnesium orthovanadate (Mg3(VO4)2), can activate C-H bonds without promoting further oxidation to COx. This suggests that isolated centers can selectively activate C-H bonds without over-oxidizing the products.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is implied in the description of vanadium oxide-based systems, where the catalyst is reduced by interaction with the hydrocarbon through a redox cycle. This indicates that lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates in the reaction.

3. While not explicitly mentioned, H-abstraction is likely involved in the C-H activation process, particularly for catalysts operating at higher temperatures.

4. The literature does not provide a specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it does mention n-butane oxydehydrogenation over magnesium orthovanadate catalysts, which could be considered a related process.

5. In industrial applications, the principles of isolated active sites and redox mechanisms are utilized to achieve selective oxidation. For example, the use of mixed metal oxides (like V/Nb/O catalysts) where vanadium ions form small clusters, and neighboring surface Nb ions improve selectivity, demonstrates how these principles are applied to enhance catalyst performance.

The document does not provide comprehensive information on all aspects of the question, particularly regarding the specific industrial example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, it does offer insights into the general principles of C-H activation and selective oxidation in heterogeneous catalysis using isolated metal centers on oxide materials.

该文献对于孤立金属中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化提供了一些见解，尽管它并未直接涉及问题的所有方面：

1. 孤立的金属中心，如镁正钒酸盐(Mg3(VO4)2)中的VO4单元，可以活化C-H键而不促进进一步氧化成COx。这表明孤立中心可以选择性地活化C-H键而不会过度氧化产物。

2. 文中描述钒氧化物基系统时暗示了Mars-van Krevelen机理，即催化剂通过氧化还原循环与烃类相互作用而被还原。这表明催化剂的晶格氧参与了反应。

3. 虽然没有明确提到，但H-抽取可能涉及C-H活化过程，特别是对于在较高温度下操作的催化剂。

4. 文献没有提供丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。然而，它确实提到了在镁正钒酸盐催化剂上进行正丁烷氧化脱氢，这可以被认为是一个相关过程。

5. 在工业应用中，孤立活性位点和氧化还原机理的原理被用于实现选择性氧化。例如，使用混合金属氧化物（如V/Nb/O催化剂），其中钒离子形成小簇，而相邻的表面Nb离子改善选择性，这展示了如何应用这些原理来提高催化剂性能。

该文档并未提供问题所有方面的全面信息，特别是关于丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体工业示例。然而，它确实提供了关于多相催化中使用氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心进行C-H活化和选择性氧化的一般原理的见解。
