[1] "Mg3(VO4)2 (Mg orthovanadate) spread over MgO is considered by some authors to be the most active and selective composition in n-butane oxydehydrogenation (propane was instead much less sensitive to the catalyst structure), due to the presence of isolated VO4 units which are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbon (oxygenated hydrocarbons are precursors of COx formation)"

[2] "Isolation of oxidizing sites is realized by dispersion of vanadium ions inside matrixes catalytically inert, such as zeolites or zeolitic-like compounds. V-silicalite exhibits relatively high yields, but low productivity; in VAPO-5 isolated VO4 tetrahedron structures have been proposed to be the active and selective sites in paraffins oxydehydrogenation."

Isolated metal centers on oxide materials facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis by providing specific active sites for the reaction to occur. The literature mentions two examples of this:

1. Isolated VO4 units spread over MgO in Mg3(VO4)2 catalysts are considered to be highly active and selective for n-butane oxydehydrogenation. These isolated units are not active in oxygen insertion onto activated hydrocarbons, which helps prevent the formation of oxygenated hydrocarbons that can lead to undesired COx formation.

2. Isolated VO4 tetrahedron structures in zeolites or zeolitic-like compounds, such as V-silicalite and VAPO-5, are proposed to be active and selective sites for paraffin oxydehydrogenation.

The literature does not explicitly discuss the Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms in relation to these isolated metal centers. Additionally, the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion is not mentioned in the given text.

While the document provides some insights into how isolated metal centers can facilitate C-H bond activation, it does not provide comprehensive information on the mechanisms involved or the industrial application to butane-to-maleic anhydride conversion. More detailed information would be required to fully address all aspects of the question.

在多相催化中，氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心通过提供特定的活性位点来促进C-H键的活化。文献中提到了两个例子：

1. 在Mg3(VO4)2催化剂中，分散在MgO上的孤立VO4单元被认为对正丁烷氧化脱氢具有高活性和选择性。这些孤立单元不会在活化的烃类上插入氧，这有助于防止形成含氧烃类，从而避免产生不需要的COx。

2. 在沸石或类沸石化合物（如V-硅石和VAPO-5）中的孤立VO4四面体结构被认为是烷烃氧化脱氢的活性和选择性位点。

文献并未明确讨论与这些孤立金属中心相关的Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。此外，文中也没有提到丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子。

虽然该文档提供了一些关于孤立金属中心如何促进C-H键活化的见解，但它并未提供有关所涉及机制或丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的工业应用的全面信息。要全面回答所有问题的各个方面，需要更详细的信息。
