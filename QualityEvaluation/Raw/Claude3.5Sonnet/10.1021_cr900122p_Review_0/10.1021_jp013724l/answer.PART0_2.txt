[1] "DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were conducted on the reaction of the propane molecule with the aluminum hydroxide clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0,1). Weak, physisorbed (van der Waals) complexes were identified. Chemisorption does not involve the Brnsted acidity of the catalyst, as no hydron transfer occurs. Instead, the reaction involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a CH bond, followed by the migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, to form the chemisorbed intermediate"

[2] "The calculations have established the existence of a weak complex of 1 with propane (physisorbed propane), of the van der Waals type (4), 4 kcal/mol more stable than the isolated reactants (without a BSSE correction)."

[3] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis.7 The cleavage of HH and CH bonds by insertion of metal atoms and ions (metal and metal ion catalysis) has been well-known for heavy metals, particularly noble metals, but it was not considered for aluminum."

[4] "An increase in reactivity for broken lattices of zeolites and a role for extraframework aluminum species of steamed zeolites in hydrogen and alkane activation is predicted by this mechanism."

The literature describes how isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically aluminum hydroxide clusters, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves:

1. Initial formation of weak van der Waals complexes between the alkane (e.g. propane) and the metal center.

2. Insertion of the aluminum atom into a C-H bond, rather than Brønsted acid-type hydron transfer.

3. Migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, forming a chemisorbed intermediate.

This mechanism is described as metal ion catalysis, similar to processes known for heavy metals and noble metals, but not previously considered for aluminum. The study does not specifically discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms.

The research suggests this mechanism can explain increased reactivity in broken zeolite lattices and the role of extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites for hydrogen and alkane activation.

The literature does not provide information on industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The focus is on fundamental mechanisms of C-H bond activation rather than industrial applications.

该文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是氢氧化铝簇，如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化。其机理包括：

1. 烷烃（如丙烷）与金属中心之间initially形成弱范德华复合物。

2. 铝原子插入C-H键，而不是布朗斯特酸型的氢转移。

3. 氢原子从铝迁移到氧，形成化学吸附的中间体。

这种机理被描述为金属离子催化，类似于已知的重金属和贵金属的过程，但之前未考虑到铝。该研究没有具体讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。

研究表明，这种机理可以解释破碎的沸石晶格中反应活性的增加，以及蒸汽处理沸石中框架外铝物种在氢和烷烃活化中的作用。

文献没有提供关于工业选择性氧化烷烃或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子的信息。重点在于C-H键活化的基本机理，而不是工业应用。
