[1] "The calculations show that the hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a much lower potential energy barrier than the elimination, for all clusters and for all types of CH bonds."

[2] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis."

[3] "The insertion of the metal ion into the CH bonds, predicted by the calculations, liberates the mechanistic model from such improbable acidbase reactions."

[4] "Dehydrogenation on tricoordinated and especially tetracoordinated aluminum centers by the mechanism uncovered here represents an alternative alkane activation mechanism."

The document does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, or industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some relevant insights into C-H bond activation mechanisms on aluminum oxide catalysts:

1. Metal ion catalysis is proposed as the mechanism for hydrogen exchange and elimination reactions of alkanes on Al(O)n sites (n = 3, 4).

2. The insertion of aluminum ions into C-H bonds is predicted by calculations, rather than acid-base reactions.

3. Dehydrogenation on tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum centers is suggested as an alternative alkane activation mechanism.

4. Hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a lower energy barrier than elimination for all types of C-H bonds.

While these findings relate to C-H bond activation, they do not specifically address the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The study focuses on aluminum oxide catalysts rather than isolated metal centers on other oxide materials.

该文档并未直接回答关于孤立金属中心促进多相催化中C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen机制或丁烷工业选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的具体问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化铝催化剂上C-H键活化机制的相关见解：

1. 金属离子催化被提出作为烷烃在Al(O)n位点（n = 3, 4）上进行氢交换和消除反应的机制。

2. 计算预测铝离子插入C-H键，而不是酸碱反应。

3. 在三配位和四配位铝中心上的脱氢被建议作为一种替代的烷烃活化机制。

4. 对于所有类型的C-H键，与催化剂的氢交换比消除反应具有更低的能量障碍。

虽然这些发现与C-H键活化有关，但它们并未特别涉及Mars van Krevelen机制或丁烷工业转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。该研究主要集中在氧化铝催化剂上，而不是其他氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心。
