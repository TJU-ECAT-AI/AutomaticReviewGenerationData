[1] "DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were conducted on the reaction of the propane molecule with the aluminum hydroxide clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0,1). Weak, physisorbed (van der Waals) complexes were identified."

[2] "Instead, the reaction involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a CH bond, followed by the migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, to form the chemisorbed intermediate, (H2O)x+1(HO)2AlCH2Et or (H2O)x+1(HO)2AlCHMe2, with the latter having a higher energy barrier."

[3] "The elimination of hydrogen from Cβ and oxygen gives then H2 and propene, which forms a strong π complex with the aluminum cluster for x = 0."

[4] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange and elimination reactions of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis."

The literature describes how isolated aluminum centers on oxide materials can facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis:

1. The mechanism involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a C-H bond, followed by migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen. This forms a chemisorbed intermediate.

2. The process does not involve typical Mars-van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms. Instead, it is described as metal ion catalysis.

3. After C-H activation, elimination of hydrogen from the β-carbon and an oxygen atom produces H2 and an alkene (e.g. propene), which forms a π complex with the aluminum cluster.

4. This mechanism was found to apply for both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites.

The literature does not specifically discuss the industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The focus is on fundamental C-H activation mechanisms rather than oxidation reactions or industrial applications.

这篇文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立铝中心如何在多相催化中促进C-H键活化：

1. 该机制涉及铝原子插入C-H键，随后氢原子从铝迁移到氧。这形成了化学吸附的中间体。

2. 这个过程不涉及典型的Mars-van Krevelen或H-抽提机制。相反，它被描述为金属离子催化。

3. C-H活化后，β-碳和氧原子上的氢消除产生H2和烯烃（如丙烯），后者与铝簇形成π复合物。

4. 这种机制被发现适用于三配位和四配位铝位点。

文献没有具体讨论烷烃的工业选择性氧化或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的过程。重点是基本的C-H活化机制，而不是氧化反应或工业应用。
