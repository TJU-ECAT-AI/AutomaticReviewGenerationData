[1] "DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were conducted on the reaction of the propane molecule with the aluminum hydroxide clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0,1). Weak, physisorbed (van der Waals) complexes were identified. Chemisorption does not involve the Brnsted acidity of the catalyst, as no hydron transfer occurs. Instead, the reaction involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a CH bond, followed by the migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, to form the chemisorbed intermediate"

[2] "Thus, the reaction is better described as metal ion catalysis, rather than acidbase catalysis."

[3] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis."

[4] "An easier dehydrogenation on all-aluminum rather than on aluminumsilicon hydroxide clusters explains the effect of extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites on catalytic activity."

The literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials for selective oxidation of alkanes, nor does it discuss the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some relevant insights into C-H bond activation mechanisms on aluminum oxide catalysts:

1. The calculations show that C-H bond activation on aluminum oxide clusters occurs through metal ion catalysis rather than acid-base catalysis. 

2. The mechanism involves insertion of the aluminum atom into the C-H bond, followed by migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen to form a chemisorbed intermediate.

3. This process does not involve Brønsted acidity or hydron transfer, but rather direct interaction of the metal center with the C-H bond.

4. The calculations predict that all-aluminum clusters are more active for dehydrogenation than aluminum-silicon hydroxide clusters, explaining the enhanced activity of extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites.

5. While not directly addressing industrial selective oxidation, these mechanistic insights into C-H activation on metal oxide clusters could be relevant for understanding and optimizing such processes.

The literature does not discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, nor does it provide information on the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. More targeted research would be needed to fully address those aspects of the question.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心对烷烃选择性氧化的C-H键活化的具体机制，也没有讨论丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。但是，它确实提供了一些关于铝氧化物催化剂上C-H键活化机制的相关见解：

1. 计算表明，铝氧化物簇上的C-H键活化是通过金属离子催化而不是酸碱催化发生的。

2. 该机制涉及铝原子插入C-H键，随后氢原子从铝迁移到氧以形成化学吸附的中间体。

3. 这个过程不涉及Brønsted酸性或质子转移，而是金属中心与C-H键的直接相互作用。

4. 计算预测，全铝簇比铝-硅羟基簇更活跃于脱氢反应，这解释了蒸汽处理沸石中骨架外铝物种的增强活性。

5. 虽然没有直接讨论工业选择性氧化，但这些关于金属氧化物簇上C-H活化的机制见解可能与理解和优化此类过程有关。

文献没有讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽取机制，也没有提供丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子信息。要全面解答这些问题的方方面面，需要进行更有针对性的研究。
