[1] "DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level were conducted on the reaction of the propane molecule with the aluminum hydroxide clusters (HO)3Al(OH2)x (x = 0,1). Weak, physisorbed (van der Waals) complexes were identified. Chemisorption does not involve the Brnsted acidity of the catalyst, as no hydron transfer occurs. Instead, the reaction involves insertion of the aluminum atom into a CH bond, followed by the migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, to form the chemisorbed intermediate"

[2] "Thus, the reaction is better described as metal ion catalysis, rather than acidbase catalysis."

[3] "Mechanistically, our calculations show that the hydrogen exchange2,4,27,30 and elimination reactions25 of an alkane on materials containing Al(O)n sites, with n = 3 and 4, are examples of metal ion catalysis."

[4] "An easier dehydrogenation on all-aluminum rather than on aluminumsilicon hydroxide clusters explains the effect of extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites on catalytic activity."

The literature does not directly address the specific mechanisms of C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials for selective oxidation of alkanes, nor does it discuss the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some relevant insights into C-H bond activation mechanisms on aluminum oxide catalysts:

1. The calculations show that C-H bond activation on aluminum oxide clusters occurs through metal ion catalysis rather than acid-base catalysis. 

2. The mechanism involves insertion of the aluminum atom into the C-H bond, followed by migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen to form a chemisorbed intermediate.

3. This process does not involve Brønsted acidity or hydron transfer, but rather direct interaction of the metal center with the C-H bond.

4. The calculations predict that all-aluminum clusters are more active for dehydrogenation than aluminum-silicon hydroxide clusters, explaining the enhanced activity of extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites.

5. While not directly addressing industrial selective oxidation, these mechanistic insights into C-H activation on metal oxide clusters could be relevant for understanding and optimizing such processes.

The literature does not discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms, nor does it provide information on the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. More targeted research would be needed to fully address those aspects of the question.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化物材料上孤立金属中心对烷烃选择性氧化的C-H键活化的具体机制，也没有讨论丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。但是，它确实提供了一些关于铝氧化物催化剂上C-H键活化机制的相关见解：

1. 计算表明，铝氧化物簇上的C-H键活化是通过金属离子催化而不是酸碱催化发生的。

2. 该机制涉及铝原子插入C-H键，随后氢原子从铝迁移到氧以形成化学吸附的中间体。

3. 这个过程不涉及Brønsted酸性或质子转移，而是金属中心与C-H键的直接相互作用。

4. 计算预测，全铝簇比铝-硅羟基簇更活跃于脱氢反应，这解释了蒸汽处理沸石中骨架外铝物种的增强活性。

5. 虽然没有直接讨论工业选择性氧化，但这些关于金属氧化物簇上C-H活化的机制见解可能与理解和优化此类过程有关。

文献没有讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽取机制，也没有提供丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的具体例子信息。要全面解答这些问题的方方面面，需要进行更有针对性的研究。

The document does not directly address the specific question about isolated metal centers facilitating C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis, the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, or industrial selective oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride. However, it does provide some relevant insights into C-H bond activation mechanisms on aluminum oxide catalysts:

1. Metal ion catalysis is proposed as the mechanism for hydrogen exchange and elimination reactions of alkanes on Al(O)n sites (n = 3, 4).

2. The insertion of aluminum ions into C-H bonds is predicted by calculations, rather than acid-base reactions.

3. Dehydrogenation on tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum centers is suggested as an alternative alkane activation mechanism.

4. Hydrogen exchange with the catalyst has a lower energy barrier than elimination for all types of C-H bonds.

While these findings relate to C-H bond activation, they do not specifically address the Mars van Krevelen mechanism or the industrial conversion of butane to maleic anhydride. The study focuses on aluminum oxide catalysts rather than isolated metal centers on other oxide materials.

该文档并未直接回答关于孤立金属中心促进多相催化中C-H键活化、Mars van Krevelen机制或丁烷工业选择性氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的具体问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧化铝催化剂上C-H键活化机制的相关见解：

1. 金属离子催化被提出作为烷烃在Al(O)n位点（n = 3, 4）上进行氢交换和消除反应的机制。

2. 计算预测铝离子插入C-H键，而不是酸碱反应。

3. 在三配位和四配位铝中心上的脱氢被建议作为一种替代的烷烃活化机制。

4. 对于所有类型的C-H键，与催化剂的氢交换比消除反应具有更低的能量障碍。

虽然这些发现与C-H键活化有关，但它们并未特别涉及Mars van Krevelen机制或丁烷工业转化为顺丁烯二酸酐的过程。该研究主要集中在氧化铝催化剂上，而不是其他氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature describes how isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically aluminum hydroxide clusters, facilitate C-H bond activation in heterogeneous catalysis. The mechanism involves:

1. Initial formation of weak van der Waals complexes between the alkane (e.g. propane) and the metal center.

2. Insertion of the aluminum atom into a C-H bond, rather than Brønsted acid-type hydron transfer.

3. Migration of the hydrogen atom from aluminum to oxygen, forming a chemisorbed intermediate.

This mechanism is described as metal ion catalysis, similar to processes known for heavy metals and noble metals, but not previously considered for aluminum. The study does not specifically discuss Mars van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms.

The research suggests this mechanism can explain increased reactivity in broken zeolite lattices and the role of extraframework aluminum species in steamed zeolites for hydrogen and alkane activation.

The literature does not provide information on industrial selective oxidation of alkanes or the specific example of butane to maleic anhydride conversion. The focus is on fundamental mechanisms of C-H bond activation rather than industrial applications.

该文献描述了氧化物材料上的孤立金属中心，特别是氢氧化铝簇，如何促进多相催化中的C-H键活化。其机理包括：

1. 烷烃（如丙烷）与金属中心之间initially形成弱范德华复合物。

2. 铝原子插入C-H键，而不是布朗斯特酸型的氢转移。

3. 氢原子从铝迁移到氧，形成化学吸附的中间体。

这种机理被描述为金属离子催化，类似于已知的重金属和贵金属的过程，但之前未考虑到铝。该研究没有具体讨论Mars van Krevelen或H-抽提机理。

研究表明，这种机理可以解释破碎的沸石晶格中反应活性的增加，以及蒸汽处理沸石中框架外铝物种在氢和烷烃活化中的作用。

文献没有提供关于工业选择性氧化烷烃或丁烷转化为马来酸酐的具体例子的信息。重点在于C-H键活化的基本机理，而不是工业应用。

The literature discusses C-H bond activation by isolated metal centers on oxide materials, specifically focusing on aluminum oxide clusters. The mechanism involves metal ion catalysis rather than traditional acid-base catalysis or hydride abstraction. The key steps are:

1. Insertion of the metal (aluminum) into the C-H bond
2. Migration of the hydrogen from aluminum to an adjacent oxygen 
3. Subsequent elimination to form alkenes

This process has lower energy barriers for hydrogen exchange compared to elimination reactions. The mechanism is applicable to both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites, with tetra-coordinated sites being more prevalent and likely more important catalytically.

The study does not specifically address the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or industrial applications like butane to maleic anhydride conversion. However, the insights into C-H activation mechanisms on metal oxide surfaces are relevant to understanding selective oxidation catalysis more broadly.

The findings suggest that traditional views of zeolites and alumina catalysts as solid superacids may need revision, as the activation appears to occur through metal ion insertion rather than proton transfer or hydride abstraction.

该文献讨论了氧化物材料上孤立金属中心对C-H键的活化，特别关注铝氧化物簇。该机制涉及金属离子催化，而不是传统的酸碱催化或氢化物提取。关键步骤包括：

1. 金属（铝）插入C-H键
2. 氢从铝迁移到相邻的氧
3. 随后的消除反应形成烯烃

与消除反应相比，这个过程对氢交换的能量势垒较低。该机制适用于三配位和四配位铝位点，其中四配位位点更普遍，可能在催化方面更重要。

该研究没有具体讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或工业应用，如丁烷转化为顺丁烯二酐。然而，对金属氧化物表面C-H活化机制的见解与理解选择性氧化催化更广泛相关。

这些发现表明，传统上将沸石和氧化铝催化剂视为固体超强酸的观点可能需要修正，因为活化似乎是通过金属离子插入而不是质子转移或氢化物提取发生的。

2. The process does not involve typical Mars-van Krevelen or H-abstraction mechanisms. Instead, it is described as metal ion catalysis.

3. After C-H activation, elimination of hydrogen from the β-carbon and an oxygen atom produces H2 and an alkene (e.g. propene), which forms a π complex with the aluminum cluster.

4. This mechanism was found to apply for both tri- and tetra-coordinated aluminum sites.
