and
infilling of the trough occurred
during the past
1 million years (Qua-
ternary). Using the seismic signals de-
tected from the two explosions in Lake
Managua, we determined the thickness
of the trough infilling to be about 1.4
km beneath Managua. The compres-
sional wave and shear wave velocities
in this material are 2.6 and 1.3 km/sec,
respectively. The compressional wave
velocity
in
the
underlying
Tertiary
volcanic rock that presumably forms
the floor of the trough
is about 3.6
km/sec. The difference in elevation be-
tween the present trough floor and the
top of the western wall reaches nearly
1 km near Managua. Thus, we can say
that
the
relative
vertical
movement
along the western edge of the graben
has been about 2.4 km.
The number of aftershocks detected
during the 20-day period covered by
this report (10 to 29 January 1973)
varied between 50 and 200 per day.
The magnitudes of these earthquakes
ranged between 0.0 and 3.0. Approxi-
mately
ten
aftershocks
large enough
to be felt in Managua occurred during
this period. Using the velocity model
derived from the two explosions
de-
scribed above, we have located 300
aftershocks to date. As shown in Fig.
2, two
clusters can be distinguished
within
the
distribution
of
aftershock
epicenters. After the Managua earth-
quake a series of seven to ten parallel
fault lines trending northeast-southwest
through the city could be mapped (4).
There is evidence of left lateral motion
at several points along the faults (the
northwestern side moved in a south-
westerly direction relative to the south-
eastern
side).
The
southern
cluster
coincides
closely
with
the
principal
fault mapped in the area, indicated by
a dashed line in Fig. 2. The trend of
the fault is N40°E.
The
directions
of the
fault move-
ments responsible for the aftershocks
can be deduced from the directions of
the first motions of the recorded seis-
mic waves. The solution is not unique,
since only compressional waves were
used. Of the two
possible
solutions,
one is in good agreement with the sur-
face observations
(predominantly
left
lateral movement along faults trending
approximately N40°E). As shown in
Fig.
3,
the
aftershocks
are
concen-
trated at depths of between 2 and 8
km, with a few as deep as 14 km and
as shallow as 1 km. The planes of the
active
zones
are
essentially
vertical.
Thus, we conclude that the aftershock
clusters
define
two
steeply
dipping
10 AUGUST 1973
faults, or systems of faults, each about
10 km in length and 10 to 15 km in
vertical extent, along which left lateral
movement was taking place at the time
of our fieldwork. The northern fault
system is approximately in line with a
fault that cuts through to the southeast
along which movement occurred dur-
ing the devastating earthquake of 1931.
If the two faults are part of the same
system, the actual length of that sys-
tem may be much greater than 10 km,
with current activity restricted to the
segment defined by the aftershocks.
A system of crustal stresses compat-
ible
with
the
inferred
directions
of
faulting is north-south compression and
east-west
tension.
We
obtained
the
same stress distribution from an analy-
sis of aftershocks following an earth-
quake that occurred in Costa Rica, 235
km southeast of Managua, on 14 April
1973 (5). This suggests that the same
stress system may persist over a region
including most of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica.
This stress system may be explained
as a consequence of differential move-
ments between two plates: the Cocos
plate on the western side of Nicaragua
and the Caribbean plate on the eastern
side. According to the hypothesis of
Molnar and Sykes (6), the Caribbean
plate
is
presently
moving
eastward,
"dragging" eastern Nicaragua with
it,
while the Cocos plate is moving in a
northerly
direction, plunging beneath
the western edge of the Central Amer-
ican Arc.
The agreement between the source
mechanism of the Managua earthquake
There are several indications in the
literature (1-3) that addition of carbon
to nonnoble metals (such as Mo and
W) confers to them some of the cataly-
tic properties typical of the noble metals
(such as Pt and Pd). For example, a
study of the reaction of 1,1,3-trimethyl-
cyclopentane in the presence of metal
films (Fe, Co, Ni, W, Rh, Pt, and Pd)
showed that only platinum rearranged
the reactant to appreciable amounts of
xylene (1). However on tungsten, while
and inferred plate movements implies
that the large-scale tectonic processes
that formed the Nicaragua Trough are
still active. Thus, we must assume that
the probability of future earthquakes
in the Managua region
is high. If a
reconstructed city is to survive where
the ruins of Managua now stand,
it
must be built to withstand earthquakes
of at least moderate intensity.

no xylene was observed initially among
the reactions products,
it was found
after an induction period at the higher
temperature studied (1).
The possibility that formation of a
transition metal carbide is responsible
for the observed change of behavior of
tungsten is further suggested by a re-
port that an increase with time in the
rate of ethane hydrogenolysis over a
molybdenum catalyst can be ascribed
to the formation of carbide, as detected

Platinum-Like Behavior of Tungsten Carbide in Surface Catalysis
Abstract. Tungsten carbide catalyzes the formation of water from hydrogen
and oxygen at room temperature, the reduction of tungsten trioxide by hydrogen
in the presence of water, and the isomerization of 2,2-dimethylpropane to 2-
methylbutane. This catalytic behavior, which is typical of platinum,
is not ex-
hibited at all by tungsten. The surface electronic properties of the latter are there-
fore modified by carbon in such a way that they resemnble those of platinum.

It must also
be noted that in the series Mo, Ru, Rh,
and Pd, the highest activity for ethane
hydrogenolysis
is exhibited by Ru,
so
that Mo,C behaves more like a noble
metal than Mo. Finally, the activity of
tungsten
carbide
(WC)
as
fuel
cell
electrode has been reported, and it com-
pares
favorably
to
that
of platinum
(3). In view of the unique position of
platinum among catalytic metals for a
large number of reactions, these obser-
vations suggest the possibility of pre-
paring catalysts that
possess
some of
the features of platinum by insertion
of carbon into other metals.
To test this concept, we have com-
pared the catalytic behavior of tung-
sten
(General
Electric;
1.4
m2
g-
)
and tungsten carbide (WC, AEG-Tele-
funken Forschungsinstitut;
5 m2 g-1)
in reactions typical of metals of the
platinum group (Pt, Ir, Pd, and Rh).
Analysis of both powders revealed no
detectable
impurities
of
these
noble
metals.
Using a gas volumetric apparatus and
a method described elsewhere (4), we
studied the chemisorption of hydrogen
and oxygen on the carbide. The removal
of adsorbed oxygen by hydrogen with
formation of water at room temperature
has been reported only
for Pt
(4),
Rh (5), and Pd (6). It does not occur
on other transition metals because they
bind oxygen too strongly. Thus, in the
case of tungsten, reduction of an oxi-
dized surface requires treatment in H2
at 750°C for 25 hours (7). In sharp
contrast, we found that a WC sample
exposed to oxygen can still chemisorb
hydrogen at 25°C, and a dose of oxy-
548
gen at this temperature cleans the sur-
face for a new hydrogen chemisorption.
These
results, which
are summarized
in Table
1, indicated that as much as
22 percent of the WC surface partici-
pates in the formation of water at 25°C,
compared to 84 percent in the case of
platinum (4).
Another
characteristic
of platinum
group metals is their ability to dissociate
H2 in the presence of H20
at 25°C.
This
ability
is
demonstrated
by
the
catalytic reduction of W03 to H,WO3
by wet H2. In the absence of a catalyst
no reduction takes place
at tempera-
tures below 400°C. When a mechanical
mixture
of Pt and W03 powders
is
exposed to H2 in the presence of water
vapor,
the H,WO3
formation
occurs
at 25°C (4). For such a low-tempera-
ture reduction, the catalyst is a source
of hydrogen atoms and must be
un-
affected by the presence of water, which
acts
as
a cocatalyst in the reduction
(8). Following the procedure used in
(9)
for platinum, we found that WC
also
catalyzes
the
formation
of
H2,
W03. The reduction is slower than in
the
case
of platinum by
about
two
orders of magnitude, and the rate shows
a
dependence
on
the
surface
area,
which
is
not
found
with
platinum.
However, there is no question that WC
can act as a source of hydrogen atoms
in the presence of water.
A more stringent test of the similarity
between Pt and WC
is
the
catalytic
isomerization
of 2,2-dimethylpropane.
Of all the group VIII metals plus Cu
and Au, only Ir, Pt, and Au have been
found to catalyze the isomerization of
2,2-dimethylpropane to 2-methylbutane
(10), a reaction proceeding through a
mechanism similar to that of xylene
formation
from
1,1,3-trimethylcyclo-
pentane on platinum (1). Our data on
W and WC, obtained by the procedure
in (10), are shown in Table 2. Drastic
reduction was necessary before tungsten
showed any
catalytic
activity toward
2,2-dimethylpropane, and then
it only
hydrogenolyzed
it.
This
is
a
trivial
catalytic property observed on all the
transition metals mentioned above. No
isomerization was observed. Tungsten
carbide, on the other hand, showed ac-
tivity after the same mild pretreatment
used
for platinum, and
at 370°C
it
isomerized
2,2-dimethylpropane.
The
isomerization activity of WC is lower
than that of Pt, but WC can now be
added to the very small list of metals
that isomerize 2,2-dimethylpropane.
With these preliminary
results, we
speculate that the success reached in
conferring to tungsten some of the cata-
lytic properties of platinum is due to a
change in the electron distribution in
tungsten by addition of carbon. In par-
ticular, carbon seems to tame the much
too high reactivity of tungsten toward
oxygen by the addition of its valence
electrons to those of the metal. If this
is so, optimum results should be ob-
tained by careful control of the amount
of carbon at the surface. Besides, an
important factor in the unique catalytic
activity of platinum in the isomerization
reactions
is its very large electronega-
tivity (11). Again, controlled addition
of carbon or other elements to tungsten
might affect the electronegativity of the
new catalyst in a desirable direction.
Finally,
the
isomerization
of
2,2-di-
methylpropane and the
related
rear-
rangement of
1,1,3-trimethylcyclopen-
tane seem to require an easy change in
surface valency (11), a platinum-like
property which seems to be acquired to
a certain extent by tungsten as a result
of carbide formation. Future work along
these
lines should be rewarding, not
only in revealing new active and selec-
tive catalysts but also in clarifying the
role of electronic distribution in cataly-
sis by metals.

Vonnegut and Chessin (1) showed
that a solid solution of 30 mole per-
cent AgBr in AgI causes nucleation in
supercooled water
at about
half the
supercooling required for nucleation by
pure AgI. According to the nucleation
theory of Turnbull and Vonnegut (2),
this improved nucleation ability can be
attributed
to the fact that while the
AgI crystal lattice is 1.5 percent
Iarger
than that of ice, the lattice of a solid
solution with 30 mole percent AgBr in
AgI
is only
1.0 percent
larger.
Pre-
sumably AgI-AgBr solid solutions with
even smaller lattice misfits should be
even better nucleation catalysts. How-
ever, 30 mole percent is apparently the
limit of solubility of AgBr in the AgI
lattice, so 1.0 percent is the minimum
lattice disregistry that can be obtained
with AgI-AgBr solid solutions. The dis-
registry,
8,
is defined as (a - ao)/ao,
where a and ao are the respective lattice
parameters of the catalyst and ice along
similar low index planes.
In searching for solid solutions of
AgI for which we could control the
lattice parameter, our attention turned
to Cul-AgI. We have prepared Cul-AgI
solid
solutions, each having
a lattice
parameter smaller than
that of pure
AgI by two techniques. The first was
direct
fusion
at
a pressure
of 10-2
torr and a temperature of 20°C above
the melting point of the solid solution,
about 600°C. The second involved dis-
solving the proper proportions of re-
agent grade Cui and AgI in hydriodic
acid and then boiling off the solvent.
The crystal class of the resulting solid
solutions is face centered cubic, but in
the
( l 11 )
plane the crystal structure
is similar to that of ice in the (0001)
plane. The lattice spacing in the (111)
plane
is
given

is the edge of a unit cell in the cubic
system. The x-ray data in Fig.

made to have any lattice spacing from
4.58 to 4.28 A measured in the (111)
plane.
This range
in
lattice spacings
corresponds to lattice disregistries with
respect to ice ranging from 1.5 percent
to - 5.2 percent. Since CuI and AgI
are not appreciably soluble
in water
(10-5 and 10-8 mole/liter, respective-
ly), they have
a negligible
effect
in
depressing
the
freezing point
of the
water.
To determine their relative effective-
ness as nucleation catalysts, powdered
samples
of about
0.5 g of CuI-AgI
were sealed in dilatometers containing
approximately
1
g of distilled water,
and the freezing temperature was ob-
served when they were cooled
in
a
vigorously stirred bath. The tempera-
ture was measured with a Beckman
thermometer
with
an
accuracy
of
0.01°C and was lowered at a rate of
0.50C
min-1
(3).
The
water
was
singly distilled and had a conductivity
of 3 X 10-6 ohm-1 cm-1.
Figure 2 shows the observed thresh-
old nucleation temperature as a func-
tion of composition for ten samples of
both the fusions and the precipitates.
The fusions were tested after having
been in water for about 1 month. The
precipitates
were
tested
immediately
after having been immersed in water.
Reduction
of the cooling
rate from
0.05°
to 0.01°C min-1 produced no
observable differences in threshold nu-
cleation temperatures.
Figure 3 shows the smallest observed
supercooling for the Cul-AgI fusions
and precipitates, as a function of lattice
disregistry with respect to ice. The dis-
registry
is
computed
for
the
(111)
plane
of
the CuI-AgI
solid
solution
and the (0001) plane of ice. Vonnegut
and Chessin's data for the AgI-AgBr
solid solutions are also shown, along
with Turnbull and Vonnegut's theoreti-
cal curve for coherent nucleation.
The
fact
that
the
temperature
of
- 2.5°C we measured for nucleation in
the presence of pure CuI is apprecia-
bly higher than the value of - 15oC
reported by Mason
and
Hallett
(4)
probably can be attributed to the very
different
conditions
under which the
observations were made. That the Cul-
AgI catalysts precipitated from HI were
generally more active than the fused
Cul-AgI
catalysts
could
be
due
to
particle size, decay of the fused samples,
or the
effect described by Bigg
(5)
where small concentrations of HI can
raise
the nucleation
temperature.
Al-
though the reasons for the difference
are not clear, the parallel nature of the
data in Fig.
3
suggests that the
dif-
ference is uniform.

Ice Nucleation by Solid Solutions of Silver-Copper Iodide
Abstract. The lattice misfit between ice and silver iodide can be reduced by
partial substitution of copper atoms for silver atoms in the silver iodide lattice.
The best crystal match is obtained with a composition of CuI-3AgI, which cor-
responds to the most active silver-copper iodide nucleation catalyst.
