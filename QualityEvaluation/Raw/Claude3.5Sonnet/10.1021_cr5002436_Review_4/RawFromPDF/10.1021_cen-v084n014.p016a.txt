SOLVING STRUCTURES 
WITHOUT CRYSTALS 
Method provides structural solutions to 
materials lacking long-range order 
S
YNTHESIZE A NEW SOLID-
state compound, and mod-
ern crystallography 
methods 
usually 
can help solve the material's 
atomic structure, provided that 
samples of 
the material are available 
in the form of bulk crystals, even 
small ones. But for nanoparticles 
and other materials that lack long-
range order, detenniningstnictures 
is challenging 
because crystallogra-
phy methods aren't applicable. 
UNDER CONSTRUCTION A new method builds 
up structures of crystallographically inaccessible 
clusters (C60 in this example) through an iterative 
process that's based on ranking the agreement 
between experimental and theoretical structure data. 
Light-colored atoms indicate large error. 
A new computational method, 
though, is poised to help with the 
problem. Researchers have devel-
oped a numerical procedure 
for 
de-
termining the atomic structures of 
aperiodic materials using the type 
of 
data measured in X-ray and neu-
tron-diffraction studies of 
powders 
and other noncrystalline samples. 
According to the researchers, the 
method may enable structures to 
be solved with subangstrom reso-
lution even when crystallographic 
methods fail. 
"Knowing the structure of a 
material is a prerequisite to under-
standing its properties,,, says Simon 
J. L. Billinge, a professor of 
physics 
at Michigan State University, East 
Lansing. Yet for certain types of 
solids, such as nanometer-sized 
chunks of semiconductors, the 
absence of long-range order rules 
out the possibility of solving the 
structure via crystallography.

Drug Companies Push Into Central Europe 
S
anof 
i-Aventis and Ranbaxy Laboratories 
are the latest pharmaceutical companies to 
make acquisitions in the fast-growing Cen-
tral European generic drugs business. 
Paris-based Sanofi has spent about $516 mil-
lion to acquire a 24.9% interest in the Czech ge-
nerics company Zentiva. Sanofi bought most of 
the stake from Warburg Pincus, which invested 
in one of Zentiva's predecessor firms in 1998, and 
the rest from current and former Zentiva 
employees. 
Sanofi, which is now Zentiva's largest share-
holder, calls the purchase "a strategic move in 
the development of Sanof 
i-Aventis in Central and 
Eastern Europe." Zentiva was formed in August 
2003 by the merger of Léciva and Slovakofarma, 
the largest drug companies in the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia, respectively. Zentiva had sales last 
year of close to $500 million, up 11% over 2004. 
Meanwhile, India's Ranbaxy will pay Advent 
International $324 million for a 97% stake in 
Terapia, Romania's largest manufacturer and dis-
tributor of generic pharmaceuticals. With annu-
al sales of about $80 million, Terapia markets 
almost 160 products and operates two finished-
dosage manufacturing sites in Romania. 
Advent, a Boston-based private equity firm, 
bought a 91% stake in Terapia in August 2003 for 
$44 million. Ranbaxy says Terapia has the know-
how to prepare generics marketing requests to 
European Union standards. This capability will 
promote Ranbaxy's business throughout Europe 
and the former Soviet Union, the firm adds. 
The two deals follow an unsolicited $1.6 billion 
bid by Iceland's Actavis for the Croatian generics 
maker Pliva (C&EN, March 27, page 9). Pliva had 
sales last year of $1.2 billion.-MICHAEL M

AND JEAN-FRANÇOIS TREMBLAY 
State developed a computational 
technique for building up cluster 
structures one atom at a time using 
readily 
available high-resolution dif-
fraction data. The data, which are 
known as atomic pair distribution 
functions (PDFs), consist of 
lists of 
interatomic spacings and a histo-
gram that indicates howmany 
atom 
pairs share a particular spacing. 
To build up structures, the algo-
rithm "positions" a small number 
of 
atoms in a cluster and then com-
pares the distance list derived from 
the computer-generated cluster 
with an experimentally measured 
list. Distance values obtained from 
other computer-generated clusters 
of 
the same size are also compared 
with the experimental data. The 
theoretical cluster that matches 
the experimental data most closely 
"wins" that round and is promoted 
to the next level, where structures 
of clusters with one additional at-
om are once again ranked accord-
ing to the closeness of the match 
with experimental data {Nature 
2006,440,655). 
Billinge explains that the pro-
cedure was inspired by the rules of 
promotion and relegation (down-
grading) that are used to rank 
teams in European soccer leagues, 
such as La Liga in Spain. 
Named accordingly, the Liga 
method was used to deduce the 
structure of C60, using PDF data 
obtained from neutron-scattering 
measurements on a solid-phase 
sample of buckeyballs. The team 
reports that the calculated data 
set matches the experimentally 
measured results quite closely, yet 
the computed structure deviates 
slightly from the ideal structure 
of C60 due to noise in the data and 
experimental limitations. 
In a commentary in the same 
issue of Nature, John J. Rehr, a 
physics professor at the Univer-
sity of Washington, remarks that 
"aperiodic materials are among 
the technologically most interest-
ing nanoscale materials currently 
under study. The new approach to 
solving these materials' structures 
could be widely applicable."—MITCH
