1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of the considerable
industrial importance, for it represents a route that economically
upgrades low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into the more expen-
sive alkenes [1]. In this context, much effort has been dedicated to
the dehydrogenation (DH) of propane to propylene [2–4] given the
rapidly growing demand for propylene in the production of
propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and polypropylene. However, the
DH of propane has inherent drawbacks: thermodynamic limita-
tions for propane conversion, high energy requirements due to
endothermic reaction and limited catalytic stability owing to coke
formation [5,6]. As an alternative to DH, oxidative dehydrogena-
tion (ODH) of propane by molecular oxygen offers the possibility of
being an energy-saving process for propylene production [7–10].
Nevertheless, the ODH process suffers from a signiﬁcant loss of
propylene selectivity due to formation of total oxidation products
and has a number of safety issues.
Recently, the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant to activate the short
chain alkanes has emerged as new promising technology for the
development of safer, more economical and environmentally
friendly propane dehydrogenation process [11–13]. It has been
shown that in this new process propylene can be obtained with a
higher yield than in the commercial one. The promotion effect of the
presence of CO2 in the reaction stream has been attributed to an
increase of the dehydrogenation efﬁciency via a direct surface redox
mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by propane)
and reoxidation (by CO2) cycles [14–16] or a more complex reaction
pathway involving a simple dehydrogenation followed by the
reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [17–19]. In the latter case
CO2 removes hydrogen from the reaction system and releases the
thermodynamic restrictions. It has been demonstrated that in many
catalyst
systems propylene formation
is promoted by both
presented mechanisms [20]. Moreover, in the dehydrogenation
process CO2 can act as a diluent [19,21,22], it delivers the required
heat and reduces coking of catalyst by the coke gasiﬁcation.
Among all the studied catalysts, the supported gallium oxide-
based materials have been documented as the most promising
ones due to their high catalytic efﬁciency [19,23,24]. One critical
limitation associated with the conventional Ga2O3-catalyzed
propane DH process, however, is the drastic deactivation during
a few hours on-stream [19,25,26]. Very recently, we have
demonstrated that Ga2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxides are highly active
and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence
of CO2 [17,18]. The superior performance of the Ga2O3–Al2O3-
system has been attributed to the formation of gallia-alumina solid
solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 [18], which can allow the
favorable creation of a high abundance of surface gallium sites
with weak Lewis acidity. However, the development of new
improved catalytic system that exhibits desirable stability and
activity still remains a major challenge.

In2O3–MOx binary mixed metal oxide catalysts (M: Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si, and Ce) prepared by a
coprecipitation or sol–gel method have been tested for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in
the presence of carbon dioxide. Several techniques including N2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction,
H2-temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were applied to
characterize the physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized materials. Catalytic tests showed
that all In-containing samples were active in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation of propane with good
propylene selectivity. Among the In2O3–MOx catalysts tested, the In2O3–Al2O3 sample containing a
20 mol% indium content showed the highest dehydrogenation activity with superior long-term stability.
The speciﬁc interaction between In2O3 and Al2O3 leading to a high component dispersion is suggested to
play a key role in regulating the redox and structural properties of surface indium species, which makes
the In2O3–Al2O3 composite highly active and stable for the reaction.

Supported In2O3-based materials have received limited atten-
tion as dehydrogenation catalysts, despite their excellent perfor-
mance to activate hydrocarbon species in the selective catalytic
reduction (de-NOx) reactions [27–31]. On the other hand, it is also
well established that Ga-containing catalysts have shown to
exhibit high activity and selectivity in the de-NOx reactions [32–
34]. In view of the catalytic similarities between Ga2O3- and In2O3-
based systems, we envisioned that it would be of interest to
explore the activity of supported indium oxide for propane
dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2. In the present study,
we show that In2O3–Al2O3 is one of the most effective materials for
propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The catalytic
stability and deactivation behavior of the In2O3-based catalysts
were also examined.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Various In2O3–MOx mixed oxide catalysts (M: Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe,
Mg, Si, and Ce) with In molar percentage of 20% were prepared via
two different synthetic approaches, i.e., coprecipitation and sol–gel
method. For mixed oxides with M = Al, Zr, Fe, Mg, Zn, Ce as well as
the simple oxide of In2O3 and Ga2O3, the coprecipitation method
was employed. In a typical synthesis, concentrated aqueous
ammonia and ethanol (50:50 in volume) was added dropwise to
the ethanol solution of indium nitrate (Aldrich, 99.99%) and the
corresponding
metal
nitrate
(Fluka,
99.9%)
until
no
more
precipitation occurred. The precipitates was recovered by ﬁltra-
tion, washed thoroughly and dried in air at 373 K for 12 h, followed
by calcination at 873 K in air for 6 h.
When TiCl4 or Si(OEt)4 (Aldrich, 99.99%) were used as the
starting materials, sol–gel method was employed to prepare the
In2O3–MOx composite materials. Typically, indium nitrate and
TiCl4 were dissolved simultaneously in an alcoholic solution under
vigorous stirring at room temperature. The pH value was adjusted
by adding NaOH dropwise until pH 10 was reached. After aging for
24 h, the gel was ﬁltrated and thoroughly washed by 3 L distilled
water. The drying and calcination treatment was the same as that
of the coprecipitation method. The ﬁnal catalyst is denoted as In–
M-n hereinafter where M denotes the second metal, n represents
the mole percentage of In2O3.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET speciﬁc surface areas of the samples were determined
by adsorption–desorption of nitrogen at liquid nitrogen tempera-
ture, using a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 equipment. The X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of the samples were
acquired using a PerkinElmer PHI 5000C spectrometer working
in the constant analyzer energy mode with Mg Ka radiation as the
excitation source. The carbonaceous C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used
as the reference to calibrate the binding energies (BE). Thermal
gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a PerkinElmer TGA-7
apparatus to determine the amount of coke deposited on the
catalyst after the reaction. Twenty milligrams of sample was
heated from room temperature to 873 K at a heating rate of
10 K min1 in ﬂowing air.
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) of the catalysts was carried
out on a Germany Bruker D8Advance X-ray diffractometer using
nickel ﬁltered Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 A
˚ ) at 40 kV and 20 mA.
Elemental analysis was performed using ion-coupled plasma (ICP)
atomic emission spectroscopy on a Thermo Electron IRIS Intrepid II
XSP spectrometer. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
results were obtained on a homemade apparatus loaded with
20 mg of catalyst. The air-pretreated samples were heated from
room temperature to a ﬁnal temperature of 1073 K at a rate of
5 K min1 in an H2/Ar stream (H2/Ar molar ratio of 5/95 and a total
ﬂow of 40 mL min1). The H2 consumption was monitored using a
TCD detector.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
Catalytic tests were performed in a ﬁxed-bed microreactor at
ambient pressure. The catalyst load was 200 mg, and it was
activated at 873 K in N2 for 2 h prior to the reaction. The feed gas
contained 2.5 vol% propane, 10 vol% CO2 and balancing nitrogen.
The total ﬂow rate of gas reactant was 10 mL min1. The feed and
the reaction products were analyzed on-line by on-line gas
chromatograph (Type GC-122, Shanghai). Permanent gases (CO
and CO2) and water (H2O) were separated using a TDX-01 column
connected to a TCD detector and other reaction products were
analyzed employing a Porapak Q column connected to a FID
detector. Blank runs show that under the experimental conditions
used in this work the thermal dehydrogenation could be neglected.
3. Results
3.1. Dehydrogenation activity
The effect of the second metal oxide employed in the In2O3–
MOx binary mixed oxides (In2O3 mole content ﬁxed at 20%) was
tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with 10 kPa CO2 used as
weak oxidant under steady-state conditions at 873 K. In all cases,
the major product formed in the reaction is propylene, and the
minor products are ethane, ethylene, and methane. Fig. 1 compares
the propylene yields on various mixed oxide catalysts. For the sake
of comparison, the activity of bulk In2O3 is also included. While all
In2O3–MOx
binary
mixed
oxides
display
an
appreciable
or
pronounced activity for propylene formation, the simple oxide
of bulk In2O3 demonstrated a very low activity. This poor activity is
consistent with the inferior activity of indium oxide or other metal
oxides as reported in the literature [24], indicating that the
dispersion of In2O3 by a second metal oxide is indispensable for the
genesis of catalytically active sites for alkane dehydrogenation.
In2O3–Al2O3 afforded the highest yield of propylene (25.6%)
amongst the various binary metal oxide catalysts. The order of
the steady activity of binary metal oxides at the reaction
temperature of 873 K was as follows: In–Al-20 > In–Zn-20 > In–
Zr-20 > In–Ti-20 > In–Fe-20 > In–Mg-20 > In–Si-20 > In–Ce-20.

The propylene selectivities in all the binary metal oxide catalysts
were >75% in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of
CO2.
The conversion of propane over different compositions of
In2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts as a function of the reaction
time has been depicted in Fig. 2. It is apparent that all samples
exhibited a very low selectivity toward propylene formation in the
initial stage of the reaction, suggesting that an induction period is
required to develop the active site. The results, reported in Table 1,
show that the In2O3–Al2O3 nanocomposites all led to a signiﬁcant
production of propylene with high selectivities (>70%) and
appreciable ‘‘initial’’ steady conversions of propane ranging from
ca. 27% to 37% at 3 h on-stream. The ‘‘initial’’ steady conversions of
propane on the In–Al mixed oxide catalysts decreased in the order:
In–Al-20 > In–Al-10 > In–Al-40, pointing to a marked composition
effect on the catalytic performance of the In2O3–Al2O3 samples.
From 3 to 8 h, all catalysts underwent noticeable deactivation
which could be attributed to carbon deposition on the surface of
In2O3-based materials, as conﬁrmed by the TG analysis (Table 2).
After 8 h on-stream operation, there has been marginal decrease in
the conversion of propane with time-on-stream over all mixed
oxide catalysts.
Another interesting observation from the time-on-stream tests
is that, even after 20 h on-stream operation (Fig. 2), a high
conversion of propane up to 26.5% could still be maintained for In–
Al-20. It is important to remark that this corresponds to only a 2.9%
loss of its quasi steady activity at 8 h on-stream. This is in sharp
contrast to the previously reported supported Ga2O3-based system
for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, in which most
of the gallia catalysts inclined to deactivate drastically in a few
hours [19,25,26]. Indeed, a clear advantage of the In–Al-20 catalyst
over a Ga2O3 sample was noticed when propane was dehydroge-
nated using b-Ga2O3 under otherwise identical conditions (see
Fig. 2). With high selectivity to propylene, such outstanding
stability as to the indium-containing catalysts has never been
reported before. It is important to note that the slow deactivation
of the In–Al-20 sample, when compared to the Ga2O3-based
catalysts, could be due to the apparently low carbon deposition
(see Table 2) as a consequence of its moderate surface acidity [35].
Also presented in Table 1 are the catalytic data of In–Al-20 in
the absence of CO2. The activity of the In–Al-20 catalyst in the
presence of CO2 was twice that in the absence of CO2. The positive

effect of CO2 concentration on the propane dehydrogenation over
In–Al-20 can be further seen from Fig. 3. All data were collected at
the reaction time of 3 h. One can see that the rate of propylene
formation remarkably increased together with that of CO and H2O
formation with increasing the partial pressure of CO2. On the other
hand, the rate of H2 formation showed no signiﬁcant increase even
with increasing the partial pressure of CO2. All these facts indicate
that the essential role of CO2 is to facilitate the dehydrogenation
process (CH3CH2CH3 ! CH25
5CHCH3 + H2) by reaction of CO2 with
H2 (CO2 + H2 ! CO + H2O), which shifts the dehydrogenation
equilibrium by producing CO and H2O.
The effect of the reaction temperature on the dehydrogenation
activity of the In–Al-20 sample was also examined. Propane
conversion and product selectivity as a function of reaction
temperature are shown in Fig. 4. With increase of the reaction
temperature, propane conversion markedly increased from 8.1% at
773 K to 35.7% at 873 K, whereas the selectivity to propylene
decreased from 86.2% at 773 K to 76.3% at 873 K, but the
selectivities were still over 75% at temperatures lower than
873 K. Further increase of reaction temperature to 923 K, the
conversion has been increased to 48.5%, but the selectivity of
propylene has been substantially diminished. Hence, the optimal
reaction temperature is 873 K in terms of the maximum yield for
propylene production.
The rate of deactivation of the In–Al-20 catalyst increases with
increasing the reaction temperature and time as shown in Fig. 5. The
rapid deactivation of In–Al-20 was observed at 923 K. After the
reaction period of 8 h, the propane conversion dramatically
decreased from the ‘‘initial’’ value of 48.5% (activity at 3 h on-
stream) to 21.6%. The change in propane conversion was much lower
at873 K;after 8 h the lossof propane conversion amounted to<6.5%.
These results clearly indicate that high temperature accelerates coke
deposition on the In2O3–Al2O3 catalyst surface which is extremely
detrimental for the maintenance of catalytic stability.
3.2. Catalysts characterization
Fig. 6 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for various In2O3–
MOx mixed oxides, along with that of bulk In2O3 as a reference. For
the sake of convenience, only the representative XRD patterns of
for In–Zn-20, In–Si-20, In–Mg-20 and In–Al mixed oxide samples
are presented. The bulk In2O3 presents a well crystallized phase.
The peak intensities and their 2u angles have been identiﬁed as
characteristic of the cubic structure of In2O3 (c-In2O3, JCPDS 6-
0416). For all mixed oxide samples, except in the case of the In–Al-
10
sample,
the
diffraction
peaks
corresponding
to
c-In2O3
crystalline phase were observed. Note that the diffraction peaks
corresponding to crystalline indium oxide phase of all In2O3–Al2O3
samples are much weaker and broader than those of In–Zn-20, In–
Si-20 and In–Mg-20, pointing to apparently higher component
dispersion of the In2O3–Al2O3 composites with respect to the other
In-containing mixed oxide materials. Moreover, a progressive
attenuation of the diffraction intensity of the crystalline indium
oxide phase is observed for the In2O3–Al2O3 samples with
increasing aluminum content. Of particular note is the totally
amorphous nature of the In–Al-10 sample, which suggests the
highly dispersed nature of the In species in this sample. This was
also expected as a result of the highest speciﬁc surface area
(195 m2 g1, see Table 2) of In–Al-10 as compared to other In2O3–
Al2O3 samples.
The redox behavior of the In2O3–Al2O3 materials has been
studied by TPR. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, the TPR proﬁle of

identiﬁed for the reduction of In2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxide samples,
where two distinct reduction features were observed. The main
reduction peak (b) ascribed to the reduction of crystalline phase
In2O3 is shifted to a lower temperature of 963 K in the In–Al mixed
oxides, indicative of the presence of a In/Al interaction which
facilitates the reduction of the supported In2O3 [29]. One can also
see that with increasing alumina incorporation, the fraction of low
temperature (LT) reduction peak in the temperature range of 473–
773 K, attributable to the reduction of dispersed indium oxide
phase with smaller particles sizes [29,30], is observed to be the
highest for sample In–Al-10 as compared to other In2O3–Al2O3
samples (Table 2). This observation further conﬁrms the presence
of at least two types of In2O3 phase in the In2O3–Al2O3 samples,
where crystallized indium oxide (b peak) and In2O3 phase highly
dispersed on alumina (a peak) co-exist.
4. Discussion
The main ﬁnding reported here is that supported In2O3 can be
applied as new effective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation
of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. In2O3-containing
catalysts, most notably in combination with zeolites and other
oxidic materials (e.g. Al2O3 or TiO2) have in the past been shown to
exhibit high activity and selectivity in de-NOx reactions [27–31].
Recently,
the
high
activity
and
selectivity
of
In-containing
materials in ethanol and methanol steam reforming reactions
has also been highlighted [36,37]. In the present work, we have
demonstrated that In2O3-based binary mixed metal oxide is one of
the most effective materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to
propylene with CO2. In this regard, In2O3–Al2O3 with the optimal
20 mol% indium content was found to be the best catalyst among
those studied. More importantly, In2O3–Al2O3 is shown to be a far
better catalyst in terms of catalytic stability for propane DH with
CO2 compared to the most effective Ga2O3-based catalysts in the
current literature [25,26]. These ﬁndings constitute a new basis for
the design and development of new catalytic system that exhibits

improved stability and activity for propane dehydrogenation with
CO2.
In view of the interesting catalytic behavior of the In2O3-based
catalysts, it is of interest to elucidate the likely active species for
propane dehydrogenation. It may be noted that no previous studies
have employed In-containing materials as catalysts for alkane
dehydrogenation. As far as the previously investigated In-catalyzed
de-NOx reactions is concerned, the highly dispersed In2O3 species
are established to be the active sites for NOx removal [28–30], in
which the reaction occurs via a direct redox mechanism involving
alternate reduction and oxidation of the surface In sites. In this
context, it may be presumed that the dehydrogenation reaction can
proceed via a similar redox mechanism as well. If this holds true,
propane is directly oxidized to propylene with a simultaneous
reduction of the supported In2O3; subsequently, the reduced indium
oxide catalyst is reoxidized by CO2. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, the
TPR of the In–Al-20 sample was conducted after ‘‘reoxidation’’ of a
H2-pretreatedIn–Al-20samplebyCO2. Itshouldbe mentioned,here,
that the H2-pretreatment temperature at 773 K permits the
reduction of the highly dispersed In2O3 but not the bulk one. As
noted above, if the redox pathway is followed, one may expect that
the reduced indium species would be readily reoxidized by CO2
atmosphere at 873 K. Nevertheless, the TPR pattern as shown in
Fig. 7e does not show any LT reduction feature in the temperature
range of 473–773 K, thus inferring that the direct redox mechanism
is probably not applicable for the present In2O3-catalyzed dehydro-
genation of propane in the presence of CO2.
To further clarify the active sites in the In2O3–Al2O3-system, the
performance of the most active In–Al-20 catalyst was investigated
after the pretreatment with hydrogen (5% H2/Ar, 673 K and 3 h). It
is important to remark that the H2-pretreatment has a distinct
inﬂuence on performance evolution of In–Al-20 at the initial stage
of the reaction (Fig. 8), with essentially no inﬂuence on the steady-
state activity of the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It is of
interest to note that the H2-pretreated In–Al-20 sample show
immediate high initial activity for propane dehydrogenation
without experiencing the induction period as observed with the
fresh In–Al-20. Meanwhile, it should be pointed out, here, that
cracking products (methane and ethylene) are the dominating
products in the efﬂuent stream during the induction period (see
Fig. 2). Moreover, it is only after the induction period (for ca. 3 h on-
stream)
a
steady
conversion
of
propane
with
pronounced
selectivity to propylene can be attained. All these facts, together
with the observation that a concomitant reduction of the dispersed
In2O3 species to corresponding metallic In0 species has been
identiﬁed by XPS (not shown), suggests that the induction period
during the initial stage of the reaction will transform the as-
prepared In2O3–Al2O3 catalyst to a working catalyst for propylene
production.
While further work is needed to fully understand the precise
nature and mechanism of the surface indium site-mediated
hydrocarbon
activation,
the
surface
stabilized
metallic
In0
nanoclusters that are generated in situ during the induction
period could be the key active species for propane dehydrogena-
tion. At this juncture, it is important to highlight that the present
In-catalyzed propane dehydrogenation may proceed via a simple
dehydrogenation pathway, more speciﬁcally the direct propane
dehydrogenation mediated by the surface stabilized metallic In0
species. On the basis of the proposed main reaction pathway as
described above, we can rationalize that the surface stabilized
metallic
In0
species
are
the
true
active
sites
for
propane
dehydrogenation. In this context, the favorable in situ creation
of In0 sites from well-dispersed surface indium sites in the mixed
oxide catalysts is the key factor in determining the catalytic
performance
of
the
In2O3–Al2O3
materials.
This
is
further
supported by the excellent correlation as identiﬁed for the
relationship (Fig. 9) between the catalytic propane dehydrogena-
tion activity and the amount of In0 derived from highly dispersed
indium species in the present In2O3–Al2O3 catalysts.
5. Conclusions
This study demonstrates that supported In2O3-based materials
are new attractive catalysts applicable for propane dehydrogena-
tion with CO2. Among the various catalysts studied, the In–Al
mixed oxides have been found to exhibit superior performance for
propane dehydrogenation due to the formation of highly dispersed
InOx species in the as-synthesized materials. Combined XRD and
H2-TPR results demonstrated that the speciﬁc interaction between
In2O3 and Al2O3 can result in the formation of In2O3–Al2O3 in
which the structural and surface redox properties are substantially
modiﬁed. Compared to bulk In2O3, the as-prepared In2O3–Al2O3
mixed oxide catalysts show dramatically enhanced activity for
propane dehydrogenation. Our results show that the highest
catalytic performance can be attained at a In2O3–Al2O3 mixed
oxide catalyst with a 20 mol% indium content, which allows the
steady formation of a maximum propylene yield of ca. 27% in the
catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K. The high catalytic

activity of the present In2O3–Al2O3 catalysts has been attributed to
the favorable creation of surface stabilized metallic In0 nanoclus-
ters as a consequence of in situ reduction of well-dispersed surface
indium sites during the induction period.
