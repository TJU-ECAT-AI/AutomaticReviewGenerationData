I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

and
infilling of the trough occurred
during the past
1 million years (Qua-
ternary). Using the seismic signals de-
tected from the two explosions in Lake
Managua, we determined the thickness
of the trough infilling to be about 1.4
km beneath Managua. The compres-
sional wave and shear wave velocities
in this material are 2.6 and 1.3 km/sec,
respectively. The compressional wave
velocity
in
the
underlying
Tertiary
volcanic rock that presumably forms
the floor of the trough
is about 3.6
km/sec. The difference in elevation be-
tween the present trough floor and the
top of the western wall reaches nearly
1 km near Managua. Thus, we can say
that
the
relative
vertical
movement
along the western edge of the graben
has been about 2.4 km.
The number of aftershocks detected
during the 20-day period covered by
this report (10 to 29 January 1973)
varied between 50 and 200 per day.
The magnitudes of these earthquakes
ranged between 0.0 and 3.0. Approxi-
mately
ten
aftershocks
large enough
to be felt in Managua occurred during
this period. Using the velocity model
derived from the two explosions
de-
scribed above, we have located 300
aftershocks to date. As shown in Fig.
2, two
clusters can be distinguished
within
the
distribution
of
aftershock
epicenters. After the Managua earth-
quake a series of seven to ten parallel
fault lines trending northeast-southwest
through the city could be mapped (4).
There is evidence of left lateral motion
at several points along the faults (the
northwestern side moved in a south-
westerly direction relative to the south-
eastern
side).
The
southern
cluster
coincides
closely
with
the
principal
fault mapped in the area, indicated by
a dashed line in Fig. 2. The trend of
the fault is N40E.
The
directions
of the
fault move-
ments responsible for the aftershocks
can be deduced from the directions of
the first motions of the recorded seis-
mic waves. The solution is not unique,
since only compressional waves were
used. Of the two
possible
solutions,
one is in good agreement with the sur-
face observations
(predominantly
left
lateral movement along faults trending
approximately N40E). As shown in
Fig.
3,
the
aftershocks
are
concen-
trated at depths of between 2 and 8
km, with a few as deep as 14 km and
as shallow as 1 km. The planes of the
active
zones
are
essentially
vertical.
Thus, we conclude that the aftershock
clusters
define
two
steeply
dipping

faults, or systems of faults, each about
10 km in length and 10 to 15 km in
vertical extent, along which left lateral
movement was taking place at the time
of our fieldwork. The northern fault
system is approximately in line with a
fault that cuts through to the southeast
along which movement occurred dur-
ing the devastating earthquake of 1931.
If the two faults are part of the same
system, the actual length of that sys-
tem may be much greater than 10 km,
with current activity restricted to the
segment defined by the aftershocks.
A system of crustal stresses compat-
ible
with
the
inferred
directions
of
faulting is north-south compression and
east-west
tension.
We
obtained
the
same stress distribution from an analy-
sis of aftershocks following an earth-
quake that occurred in Costa Rica, 235
km southeast of Managua, on 14 April
1973 (5). This suggests that the same
stress system may persist over a region
including most of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica.
This stress system may be explained
as a consequence of differential move-
ments between two plates: the Cocos
plate on the western side of Nicaragua
and the Caribbean plate on the eastern
side. According to the hypothesis of
Molnar and Sykes (6), the Caribbean
plate
is
presently
moving
eastward,
"dragging" eastern Nicaragua with
it,
while the Cocos plate is moving in a
northerly
direction, plunging beneath
the western edge of the Central Amer-
ican Arc.
The agreement between the source
mechanism of the Managua earthquake
There are several indications in the
literature (1-3) that addition of carbon
to nonnoble metals (such as Mo and
W) confers to them some of the cataly-
tic properties typical of the noble metals
(such as Pt and Pd). For example, a
study of the reaction of 1,1,3-trimethyl-
cyclopentane in the presence of metal
films (Fe, Co, Ni, W, Rh, Pt, and Pd)
showed that only platinum rearranged
the reactant to appreciable amounts of
xylene (1). However on tungsten, while
and inferred plate movements implies
that the large-scale tectonic processes
that formed the Nicaragua Trough are
still active. Thus, we must assume that
the probability of future earthquakes
in the Managua region
is high. If a
reconstructed city is to survive where
the ruins of Managua now stand,
it
must be built to withstand earthquakes
of at least moderate intensity.

How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
