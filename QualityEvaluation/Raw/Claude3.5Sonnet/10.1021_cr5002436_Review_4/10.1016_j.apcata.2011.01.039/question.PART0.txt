LangmuirHinshelwood kinetic models for catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Pt -Sn/Al2O3 are pro-
posed based on the reaction mechanisms that take into account the one step or two-step dehydrogenation
and are evaluated by fitting the experiments. When taking into consideration the fitting accuracy, the
number of fitting parameters and the rigorousness of the reaction mechanism, the kinetics of propane
dehydrogenation based on the assumptions of step-wise dehydrogenation, the first step dehydrogenation
as the rate-determining step, and low surface coverage of C3H7 outperforms other kinetic models. The
change of catalyst activity with time-on-stream is related to the rate of coke formation that depends on
the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. Finally a complete kinetic model, which includes propane
dehydrogenation and cracking and catalyst deactivation because of coking, is developed, which is found
to agree well with the changes of propane conversions with time-on-stream under different operating
conditions. Direct measurement of coke formation is avoided by the approach employed in this study for
the prediction of catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.

1. Introduction
Nowadays the world demand of propene is fast increas-
ing [13] because of the heavy increase in the demand of
polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propene oxide, cumene, phenol, iso-
propylic alcohol and many other propene derivatives. The propene
obtained as a co-product from steam crackers or FCC units
does not satisfy the growing demand. Consequently, there is
a great interest in developing alternative routes for propene
production. Propane dehydrogenation is one of the techniques
for on-purpose propene production, and several propane dehy-
drogenation processes, such as Oleflex and Catofin, have been
commercialized.
Propane dehydrogenation is equilibrium limited and highly
endothermic, which is usually carried out at 500600 C and atmo-
spheric pressure on platinum or chromium catalysts. However,
the dehydrogenation reaction is also accompanied with cracking
and coking reactions at such conditions. While cracking decreases
the propene yield, coking deactivates catalyst. As a result, peri-
odic regeneration of the catalyst is required in industrial operation.
Developing dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selec-
tivity as well as good stability against coke formation remains a
challenge.

Up to now, investigation on the reaction of propane dehy-
drogenation has been mainly focused on improving the catalytic
performance. Many efforts have been devoted to improving the
activity and selectivity by adding alkali metal, alkaline earth metal,
transition metal and also Ga and Sn in the catalyst [49], under-
standing the mechanism of coke formation on the catalyst that
causes catalyst deactivation, and building reliable reaction kinet-
ics for process design and optimization [1013]. Compared with
the investigation on the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation
and coke formation and the study to improve the activity and sta-
bility of the catalyst, much less efforts have been made to establish
complete and reliable kinetic models under industrial operating
conditions and taking into consideration side reactions and cata-
lyst deactivation. These models are essential for optimization of
the reactor and the process to increase the propene yield and
reduce the deactivation. Moreover, most of the kinetics reported
in the literature are not complete because the catalyst deacti-
vation is not considered, or the activity of the catalyst is not
related to the rate of coke formation [1417]. Among the few
complete kinetics published, Larsson et al. [18] combined the kinet-
ics of propane dehydrogenation, which was a simple power law
model, with the kinetics of coke formation. Thereafter, Lobera et al.
[19] employed the generalized monolayermultilayer coke growth
model (MMCGM) [20,21] to describe the kinetics of coking on PtSn
catalyst. Gascn et al. [22] used a similar approach to establish the
kinetics for Cr2O3 catalyst. Moreover, in previous publications on
propane dehydrogenation, only the temperature was considered to
be responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the gas compo-

sitions, including the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen,
also have significant influences on the rate of coke formation and
therefore catalyst deactivation.
For dynamic simulation and optimization of the process of
propane dehydrogenation, a transient reaction kinetics, which
takes all the important reactions into consideration is required. In
this study, a kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation includ-
ing propane cracking and catalyst deactivation over PtSn/Al2O3
catalyst is presented. Moreover, the rate of catalyst deactivation is
related not only to temperature, but also to gas composition, i.e.,
C3H6 and H2 concentrations.
2. Kinetic model
2.1. Propane dehydrogenation
The mechanisms of dehydrogenation on several catalysts have
been studied in a number of investigations. Jackson et al. [16]
studied the dehydrogenation of propane over a chromium cata-
lyst using isotopic labeling techniques coupled to transient flow
methods and identified the rate determining step as the elimina-
tion of -hydrogen from propyl radical. Biloen et al. [23] studied
the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum
and platinumgold alloys, and also concluded that the subse-
quent conversion of the propyl radical into -bonded propene
via -hydrogen elimination was the rate-determining step, while
the desorption of -bonded propene had a comparatively low
activation energy. Suzuki and Kaneko [24] investigated the dehy-
drogenation of propane over chromiumaluminapotassium oxide
catalysts and proposed that the rate determining step of the reac-
tion was the dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane.
Recently we [25] studied the adsorption of the possible inter-
mediates and the pathways of propane dissociation on Pt(1 1 1)
by density functional theory. The results revealed that propane
is physically adsorbed on Pt because the propane molecule has
no unpaired electron and cannot bind with Pt atom. Trapping-
mediated dissociative chemisorption indicated that the gas phase
molecule is trapped in the potential field of the surface in the
form of alkane, which accommodates to the temperature of the
surface [26]. The physically adsorbed molecule may then either
desorb or dissociate. Propene is chemically adsorbed on Pt by bind-
ing two surface Pt atoms through its unsaturated CC bond. More
interestingly, it was found that surface hydrogen has a remarkable
influences on the overall reactions by promoting propene desorp-
tion and hindering propene dehydrogenation. However, it is still
difficult to establish the reaction kinetics for a complex heteroge-
neous catalyst reaction such as propane dehydrogenation based
solely on theoretical calculations due to the material and pressure
gaps between theoretical calculations and experiments under prac-
tical operating conditions. Therefore, in this study the conventional
LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) approach is employed to establish
the kinetic models by assuming different reaction mechanisms and
rate-determining steps.
In the first mechanism, direct dehydrogenation of gas phase
molecule to propene on Pt surface, hydrogen dissociative adsorp-
tion, and propene desorption are involved.

In fact, this is a simple mechanism that lumps up all the possible
dehydrogenation steps. By assuming the surface reaction (I3) as the
rate-determining step, the rate of propane conversion is:

If the hydrogen adsorption is weak, the rate expression (M1) can
be simplified to (M1-1):
r2 =
k1(PC3H8 PC3H6PH2/K)
1 + K2PC3H6
(M1-1)
In another mechanism, both propene and hydrogen adsorption
are considered but dehydrogenation is assumed to proceed step by
step, i.e.

If the first CH bond cleavage of propane (II1) is the rate-
determining step, the rate expression can be derived as:
r3 =

(1 + K2PC3H6 + K0.5

(II2) is the rate-limiting step, the rate expression is:

By assuming negligible surface coverage of C3H7, or C3H6 as the
only dominating surface species, or H atom as the only dominat-
ing surface species, the rate expression can be further simplified to
(M2-1), (M2-2) and (M2-3), respectively.

2.2. Propane cracking
In preliminary propane dehydrogenation experiments on the
PtSn catalyst, only methane and ethene were detected as cracking
products, which is in good agreement with the results reported by
Wu et al. [28]. Therefore in addition to propane dehydrogenation,
the side reaction considered is the cracking of propane to methane
and ethylene, i.e.
C3H8 CH4 + C2H4
(2)
The cracking rate is assumed to be first order with respect to
propane,
rcracking = k2PC3H8
(M4)
2.3. Coke formation and catalyst deactivation
Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep
cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene)
and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by
two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphi-
tized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to
polyaromatics [2932]. These two mechanisms are represented by
C3H8 3C + 4H2
(3)
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2
(4)
The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymeriza-
tion Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane
and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it
should be included in the coking rate equation. Our DFT study
showed H2 inhibits coke formation mainly by promoting propene
desorption and decreasing the surface coverage of propene, which
lowers the rate of deep cracking or polymerization of propene.
Based on our DFT analysis, propene can be considered as the pre-
cursor for deep cracking and polymerization, and the influence of
hydrogen on the coking rate is assumed the same for both deep
cracking and for polymerization. Therefore, the coking rate on fresh
catalyst is defined as:
rc0 =
kcPC3H6
1 + K3PH2
(5)
where PC3H6 and PH2 are the partial pressures of propene and hydro-
gen. On partially coked catalyst, the coking rate is
rc = acrc0
(6)
where ac is the activity of the catalyst for coke formation.
As usual, the rate of propane dehydrogenation is written as
r = ar0
(7)
where r0 is the rate on fresh catalyst, and a is the activity of the
catalyst. The change of catalyst activity with time generally takes
the form [33]
da
dt =  d(pi, T)ad
(8)
where d is the deactivation order and  d the deactivation func-
tion, usually expressed in a LHHW form [3440]. By assuming that
coke formation takes place on the same site for propane dehydro-
genation, and only one site is involved in the rate determining steps
for both propane dehydrogenation and coke formation, we have a
first order catalyst deactivation and the same deactivation rate for
propane dehydrogenation and coke formation, i.e.
ac = a = Cm Cc
Cm
(9)
where Cc is the concentration of the active sites occupied by the
coke and Cm is the total concentration of the active sites. Therefore,
Eq. (6) is rewritten as
dCc
dt = Cm Cc
Cm
rc0
(10)
Replacing Cc with Cm(1 a) yields

dt = rc0

3. Experimental
3.1. Catalyst preparation
The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst used for kinetic study was prepared by
incipient impregnation of Al2O3 (Pural 200) with H2PtCl6 and SnCl4
solutions, respectively. The catalysts were calcinated at 530 C and
treated with steam to remove chlorine.

3.2. Catalyst characterization
The catalyst was characterized by N2 physisorption on ASAP
2010 (Micromeritics, USA) at 196 C after out-gassing the samples
for at least 5 h at 190 C and 1 mm Hg vacuum. The specific surface
areas were calculated with BET equation, and the pore volumes and
pore size distributions were determined from the N2 desorption
isotherms by using the BJH method. Prior to the kinetic experi-
ment, the catalyst was ground and sieved to particle sizes between
0.1 and 0.15 mm.
3.3. Experimental set-up
The tubular reactor for the kinetic experiments was a stainless
tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm, the temperature of which
was maintained by an electrical furnace jacketed outside the reac-
tor. Inside the catalyst packing inserted was a thermocouple for
indication of the real temperature for reaction. Silica sands as inert
packing were used for a uniform flow distribution. An online gas
chromatography (Agilent 4890D) was used to measure the outlet

the molar ratio of specie i (i = Ar, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8 and
H2) in the outlet gas.
3.4. Blank test
In order to check whether the wall of the reactor and inert pack-
ing (mainly quartz particles) catalyze the reaction, several blank
tests were carried out at different temperatures with a flow rate
of 80.0 ml/min and the results are shown in Table 1. A very small
amount of propane was converted, which was possibly due to ther-
mal cracking. The even smaller amount of C3H6 formed at 600 C
might also come from thermal cracking. In this study, however,
C3H6 is considered to be formed only by catalytic dehydrogena-
tion. The formation of propene from propane by thermal cracking
or catalyzed by the wall of the reactor or by the inert packing can
be neglected. To elucidate whether the reactor has an influence
on the conversion of propene, both propene and hydrogen with
equal molar fractions were fed into the reactor at 600 C. About
1.0% of the propene is converted to methane, ethene and propane
and, based on the carbon balance, 0.1% of the propene is estimated
to be converted into coke.
3.5. Kinetic experiments
The kinetic experiments were carried out in the fixed bed reactor
at temperatures ranging from 530 to 600 C and under 100 kPa. The
total feed flow rate was kept 80.0 ml/min for all the runs. The partial
pressures of propane, propene and hydrogen were varied by adjust-
ing balance flow. In each experiment 100 mg catalyst was used.
After being loaded in a tubular reactor, the catalyst was reduced
in situ in a flow of H2 (10 ml/min) for 100 min at 500 C.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Characteristics of catalyst
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the catalyst.
4.2. Effects of mass and heat transports on the reactions
Catalysts with four different averaged diameters were used to
investigate the influences of internal mass diffusion. The experi-
ments were carried out at 600 C, the highest temperature in the
Q. Li et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 398 (2011) 1826
23
interested temperature region. The W/F was kept 30 g min/mol con-
stant. Fig. 1 shows that the initial propane conversions of propane
did not change remarkably when the size of the catalyst was smaller
than 0.3 mm. Therefore, catalyst with an averaged size of 0.15 mm
was employed in the experiments to eliminate the influences of
pore diffusion.
The catalyst with an averaged size of 0.15 mm was used to study
the influences of the effects of external mass and heat transport on
the reactions. Experiments with 0.10 g and 0.20 g catalyst, respec-
tively, were carried out. The flow rate was varied to change the
gas velocity through the catalyst bed. Fig. 2 shows the changes of
initial propane conversions of propane with W/F ratios. The con-
version at any space velocity should be independent of the linear
velocity through the bed in the absence of interphase transport
limitations [17]. As seen in Fig. 2, for the same W/F ratio, the conver-
sion will be different when the W/F ratio is large (>50 g min/mol),
which is because of the large difference in the linear velocity
and the external mass and heat transport. When the W/F ratio is
smaller than 50 g min/mol, the influence of external transport can
be neglected. In our kinetic experiments, the W/F ratios were less
than 30 g min/mol to eliminate the influences of transport limita-
tion.
4.3. Propane conversions at different conditions
The effects of temperature, propane, propene and hydrogen
pressures on propane dehydrogenation are shown in Fig. 3(ad),
respectively. Propane conversion increases remarkably with tem-
perature (Fig. 3(a)) as expected. The conversion decreases with
time on stream and more rapidly at higher temperatures owing to
faster catalyst deactivation. The propane conversion decreases with
increasing propene concentration (Fig. 3(c)), but is only slightly
influenced by hydrogen concentration (Fig. 3(d)). It indicates a
strong adsorption of propene, which occupies most of the surfaces.
High propene concentration decreases the free site for adsorption of
the reactant molecules, and thus lowers the reaction rate. Although
no significant effect of hydrogen on propane dehydrogenation is
observed, the deactivation rate is lower at higher hydrogen con-
centration. It indicates an inhibition of coke formation by hydrogen.
The deactivation rate depends more strongly on propene (Fig. 3(c))
than on propane (Fig. 3(b)). It implies that propene instead of
propane is possibly the coking precursor.
5. Model discrimination and parameter estimation
Referring to the rate Eqs. (M1)(M3) corresponding to the
different reaction mechanisms or different assumption of rate
determining step, one can see that if the adsorption terms and the
reversible reaction are negligible, (M1) and (M2) can be reduced to
one rate equation which is the first order with respect to propane
and zero order to hydrogen, while (M3) can be reduced to a rate
equation which is the first order with respect to propane and 0.5
to hydrogen. Therefore it is possible to discriminate (M3) from the
other kinetic models based on the determination of the reaction
order of hydrogen. For this reason, some experiments were carried
out at very low propane and hydrogen partial pressures (smaller
than 10 kPa) and a high space velocity to guarantee negligible
adsorption and reversible reaction. The rates of propane consump-
tion shown in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that the reaction is indeed first
order to propane but zero order to hydrogen. Therefore, the kinetic
experiments clearly exclude (M3) from the mechanisms. As it will
also be shown later, this model cannot fit experimental data well.
(M1) and (M2) are supposed to be better than (M1-1) because
both of them have taken into account of hydrogen adsorption,
which is important in propane dehydrogenation [25]. The simpli-

fied models (M2-1), (M2-2) and (M2-3) will certainly not able to fit
the experiments as accurately as (M2), but they have less param-
eters and some of them may outperform (M2) if the number of
parameters is also an account. To compare the different kinetics
compromising the fitting accuracy and number of fitting parame-
ters, the criteria suggested by Akaike [41] was used,

This criterion takes into consideration the span of independent
data set and the number of experiments points for parameter esti-
mation and has been normalized to be independent of the scale of
data. For the same data set for parameter fitting, the MSC value
depends only on the fitting accuracy and the number of fitting
parameters. The MSC value is therefore a good indication of the
usefulness and appropriateness of the model because it is a good
balance between under-fitting and over-fitting. The best model is
the one with the largest MSC value.

By assuming plug-flow, the reactor models with different reac-
tion kinetics and rate constants are integrated by RungeKutta
method to give the outlet concentrations under different operating
conditions. To simplify the discrimination of the kinetic models, the
coking rate equations and catalyst deactivation is temporarily not
considered, and for each run of the experiments with a series of
time dependent concentration profiles, only the first analysis data
(i.e., the propene and methane concentrations), which indicate the
initial rates of dehydrogenation and cracking, are used for the data
fitting. In the fitting, the reaction constants (k1, k2, fc, K1, K2, K3) are
expressed as the reparametrized form of Arrhenius equations (Eqs.
(14) and (15)) and a reference temperature Tm (565 C) is employed.

Listed in Table 3 are the MSC and SSR values for all the seven
kinetic models. (M1) emerges as the best one according to the
MSC value; however, it involves the lumping of the elementary
steps. (M2) has the least SSR value, and is the best model to fit the
experiments; however, it has more parameters than (M1). (M1-1),
as expected, is worse than (M1) and (M2) since it has not taken
the adsorption of hydrogen into account. Among the three models
derived from (M2), (M2-2) and (M2-3) have large fitting resid-
uals, indicating the assumption of negligible coverage of either
propene or hydrogen is not appropriate. It indicates that hydrogen

also adsorbs relatively strongly at high hydrogen pressures, which
reduces significantly not only the rate of propane dehydrogena-
tion but also the rates of coke formation and catalyst deactivation.
Although (M2-1) has a fitting residual slightly higher than (M2) and
(M1), it is considered as the best kinetic model for propane dehy-
drogenation because the underline reaction mechanism is reliable,
the rate equations are simple, and the predictions are acceptable.
The model (M3) cannot well describe the experimental results,
which is in accordance with the above discussions that the sec-
ond dehydrogenation, namely propyl dehydrogenation could not
be the rate-determining step. However, this is in disagreement with
the results of Biloen et al. [23]. The contraversial results were also
observed on Cr catalysts [16,24]. This implies that the rate deter-
mining step may be dependent on the structure of the catalyst, e.g.
the size and surface orientation. A systematic study is necessary in
the future to test this hypothese.
The kinetic parameters in dehydrogenation (M2-1), cracking
(M4), and deactivation (M5), are then estimated by fitting the
changes of propene and methane concentrations with time on
stream (about 400 data points). It is noted here that, because of the
small conversion of propane, the activity of the catalyst is assumed
to be independent of the axial position. The kinetic parameters in
(M2-1) and (M4) obtained by fitting to initial experimental data are
used the initial values for the model fitting. No significant change
in parameter values is found by re-fitting all the data. Table 4 sum-
marizes the values of all the parameters of the reaction kinetics.
The predictions made by the established reaction kinetics (M2-
1) are shown in Fig. 3 (dashed line), displaying a good agreement
with the experimental data.

mined to be 44.7 kJ/mol in the present work, which agrees with the
results reported by Lobera et al. [19] and Gascn et al. [22]. How-
ever, high activation energies were obtained by Biloen et al. [23] and
Chen et al. [42]. Although there was no mention about the Pt parti-
cle sizes in these references, we still regard that the differences of
the activation energies are resulted by the differences in the particle
sizes of the Pt catalysts. It is believed that the surface is mostly ter-
minated by steps and edges on smaller particles, while the surface
is mostly terminated by terraces on larger particles [44,45]. In addi-
tion, reactions proceeding on stepped surfaces tend to have smaller
activation energies than those proceeding on terrace surfaces
[46].
The experimental adsorption energies of propene reported
by Chen et al. [42] and Lobera et al. [19] were 32.02 and
85.82 kJ/mol, respectively, and the difference was mainly due
to the different catalysts employed in the experiments. The
calculated adsorption energy of propene was in the range of
38.589.7 kJ/mol [25,43], and the differences among these adsorp-
tion energies of propene were mainly because of the different
models employed for calculation. The adsorption energy of propene
determined in our study is 94.3 kJ/mol, which is reasonable
according to the results of both experimental and DFT calcula-
tion.
However, the adsorption energy of hydrogen (238.9 kJ/mol) in
our model is higher than that reported by Chen et al. [42], indicat-
ing the adsorption of hydrogen is stronger in our study. It is also
probably contributed by the corners and steps on smaller Pt parti-
cle size [47,48]. On Pt with silica-supported, the heats of hydrogen
adsorption determined by microcalorimetric measurement [49,50]
were 95 and 93 kJ/mol at 300 K and 403 K, respectively. The ini-
tial differential heats were essentially the same for the 1.2 wt.%
Pt, 6:1 Pt/Sn and 6:1 Pt/Sn catalysts, while for the 1:3 Pt/Sn cat-
alyst, the initial heat was approximately 75 kJ/mol [50]. It seems
that the present model overestimated the adsorption heat of hydro-
gen.
6. Conclusion
In this study, propane dehydrogenation experiments are
carried out on PtSn catalyst at different temperatures and
with different inlet propane, propene and hydrogen concen-
trations. A reaction kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation
including cracking and deactivation is established following the
LH approach. The first CH cleavage in propane molecule is
identified as the rate-determining step. The underline reac-
tion mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the kinetic
model agrees with experiments and quantum chemistry calcula-
tions.
The kinetic model of coke formation taking into account the
effects of propene and hydrogen is integrated into the deacti-
vation model. The propene is identified as the main precursor
for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke forma-
tion and thus deactivation. The model describes well the kinetics
of catalyst deactivation, which is related to the rate of coke
formation and takes into consideration the facts that propene
promotes while hydrogen depresses coke formation, is proposed.
The changes of propane conversion with time-on-stream under
different operating conditions are well predicted by the deac-
tivation model. The strategy for kinetic modeling employed in
the present work is to directly integrate the coking formation
kinetic model into the deactivation model, making it possible
to avoid measurement of coke content in situ. It makes the
modeling relatively simple but still keeps a good predictive capa-
bility.
