The given scientific literature does not contain any information about carbon-based materials exhibiting catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, including reaction mechanisms, rate equations, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. It does not discuss carbon materials as catalysts or their unexpected catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.
