The literature discusses the catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. While it does not explicitly mention coke deposits or carbon nanofibers, it provides insights into the mechanisms and influencing factors for carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

The proposed mechanism involves nitrogen doping enhancing the catalytic performance of carbon nanotubes. Specifically, graphitic nitrogen atoms play a crucial role by:

1. Speeding up the activation of oxygen
2. Decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction
3. Promoting the dissociative adsorption of O2 molecules

Influencing factors include:

1. Nitrogen content: Higher nitrogen content leads to increased propane activity and propene selectivity
2. Temperature: The study was conducted at 400°C, indicating high-temperature conditions
3. Surface chemistry: The presence of graphitic nitrogen affects the electronic properties of the carbon surface

The implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. This research demonstrates that heteroatom doping, particularly with nitrogen, can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of carbon materials. It opens up possibilities for designing metal-free catalysts with tailored electronic properties and improved catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
