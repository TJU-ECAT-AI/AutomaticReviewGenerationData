[1] "Here, we report the first experimental study of the nitrogen doping effect on ODH of propane as a high-temperature probe reaction (400 1C) with the assistance of the chemical kinetics method."

[2] "When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of propene was produced and the formation rate showed a proportional relationship with the N content."

[3] "The doped samples exhibited a superior activity 1.63.5 times that of undoped CNT."

[4] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O2, promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species."

[5] "We believe that the graphitic nitrogen may play a determining role in enhancing the catalytic activity by decreasing the overall activation energy and speeding up the activation of oxygen."

The study focuses on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, rather than other carbon-based materials like coke deposits or carbon nanofibers. However, it provides insights into the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

The main mechanism proposed is that nitrogen doping, particularly graphitic nitrogen, enhances the catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes. This occurs through several processes:

1. Electron donation: Graphitic nitrogen atoms donate electrons to the carbon structure, improving electron mobility.

2. Oxygen activation: The improved electron mobility promotes the dissociation of gas-phase O2 into more reactive nucleophilic O2 species.

3. Reduced activation energy: Nitrogen doping decreases the overall activation energy of the reaction.

4. Increased propene production: Nitrogen-doped CNTs produce more propene compared to undoped CNTs, with the formation rate proportional to the nitrogen content.

The main influencing factors discussed are:

1. Temperature: The study was conducted at a high temperature of 400°C.

2. Surface chemistry: The presence and type of nitrogen atoms (particularly graphitic nitrogen) in the carbon structure significantly affect the catalytic performance.

This research implies that strategic doping of carbon-based materials with nitrogen, especially in the form of graphitic nitrogen, could lead to the development of more efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The study demonstrates that such doped materials can outperform undoped carbon nanotubes, suggesting a promising direction for future catalyst development in this field.

这项研究主要关注氮掺杂碳纳米管（NCNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的催化剂，而非其他碳基材料如焦炭沉积物或碳纳米纤维。然而，它为碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性提供了见解。

提出的主要机制是氮掺杂，特别是石墨氮，能够增强碳纳米管的催化活性。这通过几个过程实现：

1. 电子捐赠：石墨氮原子向碳结构捐赠电子，改善电子移动性。

2. 氧气活化：改善的电子移动性促进了气相O2解离成更具反应性的亲核O2物种。

3. 降低活化能：氮掺杂降低了反应的整体活化能。

4. 增加丙烯产量：与未掺杂的CNTs相比，氮掺杂的CNTs产生更多丙烯，其生成率与氮含量成正比。

讨论的主要影响因素有：

1. 温度：研究在400°C的高温下进行。

2. 表面化学：碳结构中氮原子的存在和类型（特别是石墨氮）显著影响催化性能。

这项研究表明，通过策略性地用氮掺杂碳基材料，特别是以石墨氮的形式，可能导致开发出更高效的碳基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢反应。研究证明，这种掺杂材料的性能可以超过未掺杂的碳纳米管，为该领域未来催化剂开发指明了一个有前景的方向。
