[1] "Here, we report the first experimental study of the nitrogen doping effect on ODH of propane as a high-temperature probe reaction (400 1C) with the assistance of the chemical kinetics method."

[2] "Both propane activity and propene selectivity were enhanced with the increasing N content. The N dopant was found to speed up the dissociative adsorption of O2 molecules as well as to reduce the overall activation energy."

[3] "Obviously, the undoped CNT displayed the lowest activity. When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of propene was produced and the formation rate showed a proportional relationship with the N content."

[4] "Previous studies revealed that the quinone- and/or ketone-like functionalities were active in ODH reaction."

[5] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O2, promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species."

[6] "The doped N atoms reduce the dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure and finally decrease the reaction order of oxygen"

The literature discusses the catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, rather than various carbon-based materials like coke deposits or carbon nanofibers. However, it provides insights into the mechanisms and factors influencing the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

The main findings are:

1. Nitrogen doping enhances the catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes in propane ODH reactions.

2. The catalytic activity increases proportionally with nitrogen content.

3. The proposed mechanism involves:
   a) Graphitic nitrogen atoms donating electrons to the carbon structure
   b) Improved electron mobility facilitating oxygen activation
   c) Faster dissociative adsorption of O2 molecules
   d) Reduced overall activation energy for the reaction

4. Temperature is an important factor, with the reaction studied at 400°C.

5. Surface chemistry plays a crucial role, with quinone- and ketone-like functionalities being active in the ODH reaction.

6. Nitrogen doping reduces the dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure.

These findings have implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts by demonstrating the potential of heteroatom doping, particularly nitrogen, to enhance catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The study suggests that controlling the type and amount of dopants can be a strategy for tuning the catalytic properties of carbon materials.
