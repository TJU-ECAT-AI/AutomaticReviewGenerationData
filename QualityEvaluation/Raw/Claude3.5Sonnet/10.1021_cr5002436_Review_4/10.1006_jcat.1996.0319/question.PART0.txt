The behavior of iron oxide-based catalysts supported on zirconia
in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene was investigated. Iron oxide-
on-zirconia catalysts deactivate during operation due to carbon
deposition. It was shown with XRD that solid state reactions be-
tween the active phase and the support do not take place in the
zirconia-supported catalysts: the iron-containing phase after reac-
tion is Fe3O4. The total amount of carbon deposited onto zirconia-
supported catalysts containing only iron oxide as determined with
temperature-programmed oxidation is about 2 wt% C after 20 h. It
was also shown that a carbon species deposited in narrow pores was
present in iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts. The KFe/ZrO2 catalysts
proved to be more stable than KFe/MgO catalysts: for catalysts
containing highly dispersed iron oxide only a slight deactivation
was observed after about 100 h on stream. This deactivation is at-
tributed to migration of potassium from the catalyst to the quartz
reactor. Catalysts of low loadings (1 wt% Fe, 1 wt% K) or with less
well-dispersed iron oxide deactivate in a shorter period of time: an
incomplete coverage of the zirconia support leads to deactivation
by carbon deposition. The selectivity to butadiene of the KFe/ZrO2
catalysts is about 60%, which is related to a high production of
CO2. This is attributed to carbon deposition taking place in the
small pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts. The coke is subse-
quently gasified, probably by the supported potassium carbonate.
Eliminating the small pores substantially improved the butadiene
selectivity.

1. INTRODUCTION
The use of a supported iron oxide catalyst can circum-
vent the mechanical degradation of the unsupported dehy-
drogenation catalysts due to the structural transformation
of the iron oxide phase under reaction conditions (1). The
concept of using an oxidic support in dehydrogenation cat-
alysts has been reintroduced by Stobbe et al. Stobbe de-
scribed in his thesis (2) and related papers (36) the prepa-
ration, characterization, and testing in the dehydrogenation
of 1-butene of an iron oxide-based catalyst supported on

preshaped magnesia support bodies. However, MgO is li-
able to reaction with water vapor and carbon dioxide from
atmospheric air, which causes the formation of magnesium
hydroxide and (hydroxy-)carbonates. Therefore, it can be
suspected that the magnesia-supported catalyst is less sta-
ble during, e.g., storage or plant start-up. In the present
work, an alternative support material is studied. In view
of its properties which are described in the literature (7),
zirconium dioxide (zirconia) is a candidate catalyst support
material for application in dehydrogenation processes.
In a preceding paper, the preparation and characteriza-
tion of zirconia-supported iron oxide-based catalysts were
reported (1). It was demonstrated that a homogeneously
distributed, well-dispersed iron oxide-on-zirconia catalyst
could be prepared using incipient wetness impregnation of
preshaped support bodies. Also the addition of potassium,
the component required for keeping the active surface free
from deactivating carbonaceous deposits, was investigated.
In this paper the behavior of the obtained catalysts in the
dehydrogenation of 1-butene is described. The results of the
test reaction will establish whether the concept of using a
supported iron oxide-based dehydrogenation catalyst can
be extended to another support material, viz., zirconium
dioxide.
The first and principal property that is dealt with is
the deactivation behavior of the Fe/ZrO2 and Fe,K/ZrO2
catalysts. Subsequently the catalytic performance includ-
ing the selectivity to butadiene is discussed. Also the de-
position of carbon as a cause for deactivation is examined.
Finally, from temperature-programmed activity measure-
ments kinetic parameters for butene dehydrogenation over
zirconia-supported Fe,K catalysts are determined.
2. METHODS

scribed previously (1). A short description will be given

Zirconia bodies were obtained from various manufac-
turers: Daiichi RSC-H, monoclinic ZrO2 pellets, φ 3 mm
(batches I and II (7)); Engelhard L6132 pellets (ca. 60%
monoclinic  40% tetragonal), φ 3 mm; and Norton XZ
16052, monoclinic ZrO2 extrudates, φ 3 mm. Prior to im-
pregnation,thesupportswereprecalcinedat850Cinairfor
16 h to obtain stable specific surface areas of about 20 m2/g
and pore volumes of 0.25, 0.17, and 0.22 ml/g, respectively.
The pretreated supports were impregnated to incipient
wetness using either a solution of ammonium iron (III) cit-
rate (Merck, 28% Fe) or a solution of both ammonium iron
(III) citrate and potassium carbonate. In some cases cata-
lysts were impregnated with iron (III) nitrate or ammonium
iron (III) EDTA to be able to investigate the influence of
the iron precursor on the iron oxide distribution and on the
catalytic performance. After drying at room temperature,
the catalysts were calcined in air at 750C for 16 h.

Determination
of the amount of deposited carbon was performed imme-
diately after the test reaction by TPO using 5 v% O2 in N2
(50 ml/min). Fractured catalyst samples (0.1500.425 mm)
were oxidized using a heating rate of 3C/min. Carbon
was detected as CO2 in a gas chromatograph (Porapak Q
column, 1/8, 2.5 m; He carrier gas; 160C) equipped with a
thermal conductivity detector. Using a mass spectrometer
it was verified that the production of CO during TPO was
negligible.
Catalyst Testing
Nonoxidative butene dehydrogenation was carried out
in a semiautomated flow apparatus, as schematically re-
presented in Fig. 1. A detailed description of the different
components is given in Stobbes thesis (2). The main differ-
ence is the location of the temperature measurement and
control. A thermocouple inserted in a small, sealed quartz
tubing (φ 3 mm) was inserted through the top of the quartz
reactor to measure the temperature inside the catalyst bed,
downstream with respect to the gas flow.
A gas mixture (atmospheric pressure) of 5v% 1-butene
(Hoek Loos, 2.5), 30v% steam (added by passing the gas
flow through a saturator kept at 70C) in N2 (Hoek Loos,
5.0), resulting in a water/1-butene ratio (mole/mole) of
6, was passed upflow through the catalyst bed which had
previously been heated up in air to 600C. Temperature-
programmed activity measurements were performed in the
temperature range of 425625C, using a water/1-butene
ratio of 8.3. About 1 g of catalyst (sieve fraction, 0.50
0.85 mm) was used at a gas flow rate of 50 ml/min,

resulting in a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of
0.35 gbutene/(gcatalyst · h). By using the same catalyst mass in
all tests, the WHSV was kept constant when testing cata-
lysts based on the various support oxides which have differ-
ent specific densities. To investigate the activity of a carbon
surface the catalytic performance of an activated carbon
sample (Printex U, 110 m2/g) was tested.
Calculations of the conversion, the selectivity to prod-
uct i, and the yield of product i were carried out in the same
manner as was done earlier (2, 4, 6),

where Prod. (i) refers to the concentration of product i in
mole/l; n(i) refers to the ratio between the number of car-
bon atoms in product i and the number of carbon atoms
in butene; Butenes (after) is the total amount of unreacted
butenes. The denominator in Eqs. [1] and [3] thus equals
the concentration of butenes in the feed. The linear butene
isomers are all considered as reactants, since the dehydro-
genation of these compounds proceeds similarly (4).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Iron Oxide-on-Zirconia Catalysts
Butene conversions and selectivities to butadiene as a
function of time at 600C for iron oxide-on-zirconia cat-
alysts containing different amounts of iron are presented
in Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively. The byproduct yields for
a 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. The butene
conversion and butadiene selectivity for the bare support
material are presented in Fig. 4.
As can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at
600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt%
Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial
value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approxi-
mately4.55h.Thelatterconversionlevelisobservedforall
catalysts after the deactivation has completed (also for cat-
alysts containing magnesia or titania as the support (4, 7)),
for the bare support material (Fig. 4), and for a sample of
activated carbon (Printex U; not shown). It seems to be
characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered
by carbonaceous deposits. It can be calculated from ther-
modynamics (4, 8, 9) that carbon deposition will take place
under the conditions used in these experiments.
Two processes that take place upon the exposure of the
catalysts to the feed, viz., carbon deposition and reduction
of the supported iron oxide phase, both influence the deac-
tivation behavior. With X-ray diffraction Fe3O4 is shown to
be present in the Fe/ZrO2 catalysts after the catalytic reac-
tion. Reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 increases the selectivity
toward butadiene and the butadiene yield,since Fe3O4 is

the more selective phase in dehydrogenation (10). Stated
alternatively, α-Fe2O3 behaves as a catalyst for deep oxi-
dation and produces CO2. The reduction of α-Fe2O3 and
production of CO2 initially compensate the loss in butene
conversion due to carbon deposition. When the reduction
is complete, a higher rate of deactivation, due to carbon
deposition only, is observed. The course of the decreas-
ing conversion observed with the 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst
(Fig. 2a) can indeed be divided into two regions, the first
showing a low deactivation rate and the second showing a
rapid deactivation. This would indicate that the deactiva-
tion is governed by the above two effects, which operate
successively as described.
However, carbon deposition alone could also be respon-
sible for the observed deactivation process. The plot can
also be fitted by a sigmoidal carbon deposition model, e.g.,
as proposed by Dadyburjor et al. (11), which is charac-
terized by an autocatalytic initiation/propagation mech-
anism of coke deposition. Therefore, more information

(deactivation behavior of other catalysts and the product
selectivity plots) has to be studied to discriminate between
the two models.
The type of catalystsupportdidnotinfluencethecatalytic
properties of the Fe/ZrO2 system. The iron loading seems
to affect the time required to complete the deactivation,
but does not have a large effect on the overall catalytic
behavior.
In Fig. 2b it can be seen that the initial selectivity to-
wards butadiene formation is low, about 35 to 50%. From
the product yield plot (Fig. 3), it can be deduced that this
low selectivity is caused by an oxidation of part of the hy-
drocarbons to carbon dioxide by oxygen originating from
the applied iron oxide which is being reduced by the hydro-
carbons. The selectivity passes through a maximum before
assuming a constant level. The CO2 production, and, hence,
the iron oxide reduction, stops at the same point in time as
the deactivation has completed. The butadiene selectivity
maximum coincides with a slight minimum in the propene
yield and not with the expected completion of the reduc-
tion to Fe3O4, the phase which shows the highest selectivity
towards butadiene (10).
More information can be obtained from the isomeriza-
tion reaction taking place. Figure 5 shows that the isomer-
ization reaction of 1-butene to its isomers cis- and trans-
2-butene proceeds rapidly until the start of the period of
rapid deactivation is reached. This is an indication that from
that moment on the surface becomes covered with carbona-
ceous deposits, since all deactivated catalysts (also catalysts
containing other supports) as well as the activated carbon
sample show a low activity in the isomerization reaction.
This low activity can probably be attributed to a decreased
adsorption of 1-butene on the deactivated catalyst surface.
The information discussed above brings us to the follow-
ing explanation for the observed deactivation behavior. In
the first stage of the deactivation hardly any carbon deposi-
tion occurs on the iron oxide surface, due to immediate ox-
idation of the deposits by the active component. Adsorbed
butene molecules either are oxidized completely or des-
orb as butene isomer or as butadiene. As the reduction of
the catalyst proceeds, the fraction of Fe3O4 increases, the
deep oxidation activity decreases, and the butadiene yield
increases. Just before completion of the reduction process,
the oxidation reaction can no longer keep up with the car-
bon deposition, and a rapid covering of the active surface
with carbon occurs. This is evidenced by the drop of the con-
version and the sudden disappearance of the isomerization
activity.
As compared with the magnesia-supported catalysts
reported on earlier by Stobbe et al. (4), a different be-
havior is observed for the iron-on-zirconia system. The
iron-on-magnesia catalysts deactivate more slowly after an
initial activation which was explained by reduction of the
supported iron oxide phase. Product yield plots explain
this phenomenon: the carbon dioxide production contin-
ues until about 10 h after the start of the catalytic reaction.
Consequently, the coverage of the active surface proceeds
more gradually. The observed by-product selectivities do
not show large differences for both catalyst systems.
Effect of Addition of Potassium
To determine the stability of the catalytic performance
of the zirconia-supported catalysts containing both iron and
potassium, butene conversion and butadiene selectivity was
monitored at 600C as a function of time-on-stream. These
variables are shown for iron oxide catalysts with various
loadings of both components in Figs. 6 and 7. The yield of
the various products is plotted in Fig. 8.
It can be seen in Fig. 6 that there is no clear correlation
between the iron and potassium loadings and the conver-
sion of butene and the selectivity to butadiene. Figure 6

shows a higher selectivity to butadiene for the catalyst with
9 wt% Fe and 9 wt% K. However, in the complete (3 × 3)
matrix of catalysts with varying loadings no correlation was
found. If the iron or potassium loading is below 1 wt%,
however, the catalysts deactivate. With a catalyst containing
only 0.25 wt% Fe and 0.25 wt% K, for instance, a decrease
in conversion is observed starting after about 2 h on stream.
This deactivation is attributed to carbon deposition, since
the isomerization activity decreases parallel to the conver-
sion as was also noted with the catalysts without potas-
sium. This deactivation can also be observed with cata-
lysts which show an inhomogeneous distribution of the
iron/potassium phase after preparation. It therefore seems
likely that the coverage of the support surface with the iron
oxide-potassium oxide phase plays a crucial part in catalyst
stability. Possibly the growth of carbon initiates on the bare
surface of the zirconia support.
FIG. 8.
Product yield plots for the various products versus time-on-
stream for a 3 wt% Fe, 9% K/ZrO2 catalyst (ex citrate, and potassium
carbonate, on Daiichi (I) support, 600C).
The results of the prolonged test presented in Fig. 7 show
that with a catalyst containing 6% Fe and 9% K after about
100 h a small decrease of the conversion has occurred.
Whether this is due to some intrinsic deactivation phe-
nomenon or to potassium loss to the quartz reactor cannot
be decided with certainty. Formation of potassium silicate
in the reactor wall was observed with the potassium con-
taining zirconia-supported catalysts. With the Fe,K/MgO
catalysts described by Stobbe et al. (6), deactivation was
observed for catalysts with similar Fe and K loadings al-
ready after 30 h on stream. No change in the isomerization
activity, which would be indicative of carbon deposition, is
observed with the zirconia-supported samples after 100 h.
This leads to the conclusion that potassium depletion causes
the deactivation observed after long times-on-stream.
A remarkable difference with the (Fe,K) catalysts sup-
ported on magnesia or with the reference bulk iron oxide-
based catalyst S-105 (6) is the low selectivity toward
the formation of 1,3-butadiene which is characteristic for
the zirconia-supported catalysts. As can be seen in Fig. 8,
the low selectivity is related to a high carbon dioxide pro-
duction. The zirconia-supported catalysts produce carbon
dioxide in large quantities, whereas other products, such as
propene, show comparable yields.
To obtain more information on the deposition of car-
bon on the catalysts, temperature-programmed oxidation
of various zirconia-supported catalysts immediately after
performing the test reaction was carried out. Comparison
with the data reported for magnesia-supported catalysts (4)
should reveal whether the carbon deposition is more pro-
nouncedwithzirconiaasthesupport.Alternatively,adiffer-
ent active phase which possesses a higher activity for deep
oxidation could be present in the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts un-
der reaction conditions. By determining the activation ener-
gies for the dehydrogenation reaction, information about
the active phase present under reaction conditions is ob-
tained. With XRD, the nature of the iron-containing phase
in the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts before (1) and after reaction
could not be established. Finally, the carbon dioxide could
result from direct oxidation of the hydrocarbons caused by
diffusion limitations: the zirconia-supported samples con-
tain narrower pores than the other two catalysts and the
pore size has been shown to have a great influence on the
selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions (10, 12). Perform-
ing catalytic measurements with smaller catalyst particles
shouldgiveinformationonanydiffusionlimitations.Thein-
fluence of the pore size distribution is evaluated by testing
a catalyst which is prepared by impregnation of a zirconia-
support which was sintered at 1100C and therefore con-
tains mainly larger pores (7).

in Fig. 9. The total carbon deposition on a Fe/ZrO2 catalyst
as a function of time is plotted in Fig. 10.
For the iron oxide-on-zirconia catalyst a carbon depo-
sition which increases steadily with time-on-stream is ob-
served (Figs. 9 and 10). The oxidation of the deposited
carbon seems to take place in one step. It must be re-
marked, however, that the CO2 peak shows a small but
long tail indicative of the formation of carbon which can-
not be oxidized readily, e.g., carbon present in the mi-
cropores of the catalyst. This was checked by maintain-
ing the temperature constant at 425C, until CO2 could
no longer be detected with the chromatograph. When the
temperature was raised again, no CO2 was detected, which
points to the transport limitation with the oxidation of these
deposits. This badly accessible carbon is formed almost
instantly, whereas the readily accessible carbon starts to

build up after about 0.51 h. Apparently, the readily ac-
cessible carbon becomes more structurally organized with
time: the onset temperature of oxidation shifts from about
250C for carbonaceous deposits resulting after shorter de-
position times to 280C for coke oxidized after 16 h on
stream.
In the total carbon deposition plot (Fig. 10), two rates of
carbon deposition can be distinguished with the Fe/ZrO2
catalysts. Initially, the deposition rate is high. After about
4 h coking proceeds at a lower rate. This period is about
equal to the time required for a 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst
to deactivate to a constant level (cf. Fig. 2a). Therefore,
it can be assumed that the carbon deposits have covered
the entire active surface at that stage. The low deposition
rate is probably characteristic for deposition of carbon onto
carbon. The decreased adsorption of the coke-forming re-
actants and products at the surface (cf. the isomerization
activity, Fig. 5) are probably responsible for the lower rate
of carbon deposition. Furthermore, based on the specific
surface area of the catalyst (ca. 20 m2/g(1)) and the den-
sity and interatomic distances of graphite, an average layer
thickness of about one monolayer can be calculated for
1.5 wt% C deposited on the catalyst. This also corresponds
with the deflection point in Fig. 10.
Catalysts containing also potassium show different cok-
ing properties than the Fe/ZrO2 sample (Fig. 9). First, the
amount of deposited carbon is about 15 to 20 times less after
16 h on stream. Second, catalysts with potassium seem to
build up only the type of coke which was designated above
asthebadlyaccessibletype.Itisclearthatincatalystswith
potassium the carbon deposition is not prevented entirely.
The detected CO2 in the TPO experiments is not generated
by the reaction of iron (III) oxide with potassium carbonate
to KFeO2 and CO2, which may be expected to proceed in
this temperature range (1, 7). This was checked by heating
a fresh catalyst in nitrogen: any amount of CO2 formed by
the solid state reaction was too small to be detected.
Temperature-Programmed Measurements
and Kinetic Parameters
Results of temperature-dependent measurements of
butene conversion, butadiene selectivity and product yields
for a Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst are shown in Figs. 11 and 12.
In Fig. 11 it can be seen that the onset temperature of
butene conversion for the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst in 450C,
which is about the same as that measured with Fe,K/MgO
catalysts. Also the temperature at which a conversion of
40% is reached (T40) is about equal for both catalysts, viz.,
595C. The selectivity to 1,3-butadiene at that temperature
(S40), however, is only 63% for the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalyst,
versus 8384% for Fe,K/MgO catalysts. Figure 12 demon-
strates that this is related to a higher production of CO2.
Furthermore, in Fig. 11 a step is present in the selectivity
plot. This is caused by a related step in the CO2 yield at

about 530C. If the activity curve is measured at decreasing
temperatures, a sudden stepwise end of the CO2 formation
is observed also. This may be attributed to the formation
of the badly accessible carbon, which was encountered
in TPO. Above about 530C the carbon can be oxidized,
whereas below these temperatures it is not removed by the
gasification reaction.
From the temperature-dependent activity plots Arrhe-
nius plots have been constructed and apparent activation
energies for the dehydrogenation reaction have been
calculated following the procedure described by Stobbe
et al. (4, 6). The obtained values are listed in Table 1. All
kinetic data have been derived from 1-butene conversions
below 10%.
In Table 1 it can be seen that there is a scattering in the
calculated activation energies of 6 kJ/mole above and below
the average value of about 149 kJ/mole. If this experimental
uncertainty is taken into account, the apparent activation
energies shown by the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts are somewhat
lower than the values of about 155 kJ/mole reported by
FIG. 12.

Stobbe et al. (6) for Fe,K/MgO catalysts. The temperatures
T40 are slightly higher than most temperatures reported by
Stobbe et al. (about 590C), but are equal to the T40 values
reported for the S-105 reference catalyst and the Fe,K/MgO
catalyst which was exposed to atmospheric air. Since the
Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts have also been exposed to air before
determining the catalytic activity, the values of T40 agree. It
seems that there is an influence of the potassium loading.
At equal iron loading an increased potassium loading re-
sults in a higher T40. This might be due to a decrease of the
accessible active surface area. The selectivity at 40% con-
version (S40) is lower for all zirconia-supported catalysts, as
was discussed previously.
Transport Limitations
Calculations performed to determine the Thiele mod-
ulus 8s and effectiveness factor η did not indicate that
diffusion limitations are present: η was estimated to be
equal to unity for the zirconia-supported catalysts (13). Per-
forming catalytic measurements with smaller catalyst parti-
cles should give experimental evidence to confirm whether
transport limitation is indeed absent (12), but no effect of
the used catalyst sieve fraction on the performance was ob-
served. However, diffusion limitations were observed with
the temperature-programmed oxidation of the carbona-
ceous deposits. The presence of narrow pores may affect
the coking and gasification properties of the catalysts. This
was checked by testing a catalyst which was prepared us-
ing a support material which was precalcined at a substan-
tially higher temperature, viz., 1100C, prior to impregna-
tion. This procedure eliminates the smaller pores to a great
extent (7). The calculated micropore surface is reduced to
about 0.8 m2/g, as opposed to about 3 m2/g for a support
treated at 850C. The butene conversion and butadiene se-
lectivity of this catalyst are plotted in Fig. 13.

FIG. 13.
1-Butene conversion, 1,3-butadiene selectivity, and butadi-
ene yield versus time-on-stream for a zirconia-supported catalyst prepared
with a support precalcined at 1100C (1 wt% Fe, 1 wt% K, on Daiichi (II)
support, 600C).
It can be seen in Fig. 13 that the 1,3-butadiene selectivity
is about 80% for the catalyst on the sintered support. Simul-
taneously, the activity at 600C has decreased to about 30%.
This indicates that the texture of the zirconia support plays
a role in the observed selectivity behavior. If a high butadi-
ene selectivity is needed at equal butadiene yields, the use
of a sintered support is a way to meet with this requirement.
4. FURTHER DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The iron oxide-on-zirconia catalysts deactivate during
operation due to carbon deposition within about 4 h.
This period is intermediate between magnesia- and titania-
supported catalysts (4, 7). The explanation for this order
can be found in the deactivation mechanism.
In titania-supported catalysts the formation of FeTiO3
occurs very rapidly, which deactivates the catalyst (7, 14).
It was shown with XRD that bulk solid state reactions be-
tween the active phase and the support do not take place in
the zirconia-supported catalysts: the iron-containing phase
after reaction is Fe3O4. Magnesia-supported catalysts de-
activate due to carbon deposition (4), but at a slower rate
than the zirconia-supported catalysts. Comparison with the
values reported by Stobbe et al. (4) show that the total
amount of carbon deposition onto zirconia-supported cata-
lysts containing only iron oxide as determined with TPO is
about equal to that found with magnesia-supported cata-
lysts. However, it was also shown that a carbon species de-
posited in narrow pores was present in Fe/ZrO2 samples.
The different deactivation behavior can therefore be un-
derstood from the location of the deposited coke.
Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simulta-
neously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4,
which increases the selectivity toward butadiene. The bu-
tadiene yield increases also, since the rise in the selectivity
is higher than the decrease in the conversion due to a de-
creasing carbon dioxide production. At a certain point in
time, the iron oxide reduction is complete and the coke
layer growing from the deposits which were present from
the beginning starts to cover the active phase. This low-
ers the butadiene yield immediately, and consequently, at
constant by-product formation rates, also the butene con-
version. The fact that coke is deposited instantly and is able
to grow from the small pores to cover the entire catalyst
surface explains the shorter period of time involved in the
deactivation than that seen with the magnesia-supported
catalysts. Nucleation of coke on the (basic and wide pore)
magnesia support is likely to proceed more slowly and the
deactivation therefore follows a less steep trajectory.
However, the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts proved to be even
morestablethantheFe,K/MgOcatalysts:forwell-dispersed
catalysts only a slight deactivation was observed after about
100 h on stream. This deactivation is attributed to migration
of potassium from the catalyst to the wall of the quartz reac-
tor. Catalysts with very low loadings or less well-dispersed
catalysts deactivate in a shorter period of time. This indi-
cates that an incomplete coverage of the zirconia support
leads to deactivation by carbon deposition.
The selectivity to butadiene of the Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts is
relatively low, which is related to a high production of car-
bondioxide.Thisisnotattributedtoahigherdeepoxidation
activity of these catalysts, nor to diffusion limitations favor-
ing sequential oxidation of the butadiene. The origin of the
high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition
is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported
catalysts. This coke is subsequently gasified, probably by the
supported potassium carbonate when the deposited layer
has grown to such an extent that it reaches the supported
phase. Eliminating the small pores by sintering treatments
at high temperatures (or, e.g., by using sinter aids or by us-
ing wide porous zirconia support materials) substantially
improves the butadiene selectivity.
