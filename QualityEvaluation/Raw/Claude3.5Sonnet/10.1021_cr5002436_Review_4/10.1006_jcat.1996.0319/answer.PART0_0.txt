[1] "It can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.5-5 h."

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simultaneously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases the selectivity toward butadiene."

[4] "The fact that coke is deposited instantly and is able to grow from the small pores to cover the entire catalyst surface explains the shorter period of time involved in the deactivation than that seen with the magnesia-supported catalysts."

The literature does not directly address unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on the deactivation of iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia due to carbon (coke) deposition. 

The document describes how coke deposition occurs rapidly in narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts, leading to faster deactivation compared to magnesia-supported catalysts. This coke formation is seen as detrimental to catalyst performance rather than exhibiting catalytic activity itself.

The literature does not discuss carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or propose mechanisms for carbon-based catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions. It also does not explore the development of novel carbon-based catalysts.

While the document provides insights into carbon deposition behavior and its effects on iron-based catalysts, it does not address the specific question about unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的意外催化活性。相反，它主要关注由于碳(焦炭)沉积导致的氧化锆负载铁基催化剂的失活。

文献描述了焦炭沉积如何迅速发生在氧化锆负载催化剂的窄孔中，导致比氧化镁负载催化剂更快的失活。这种焦炭形成被视为对催化剂性能有害，而不是表现出催化活性。

文献没有讨论碳纳米纤维、混合纳米碳，也没有提出碳基材料在脱氢反应中催化活性的机制。它也没有探讨新型碳基催化剂的开发。

虽然该文献提供了关于碳沉积行为及其对铁基催化剂影响的见解，但它并未涉及碳材料在烷烃脱氢反应中意外催化活性的具体问题。
