          "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."
          
          "Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simultaneously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases the selectivity toward butadiene."
          
          "This coke is subsequently gasified, probably by the supported potassium carbonate when the deposited layer has grown to such an extent that it reaches the supported phase."
          
          "It can be calculated from thermodynamics (4, 8, 9) that carbon deposition will take place under the conditions used in these experiments."
          
          "The origin of the high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts."

          The provided literature does not directly address the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on the effects of carbon deposition on iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia during butene dehydrogenation reactions.

          Key points from the literature include:

          1. Carbon deposits form on the catalyst surface, creating an inert layer.
          2. Rapid carbon deposition occurs in narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts.
          3. Carbon deposition coincides with the reduction of iron oxide from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, increasing selectivity towards butadiene.
          4. In potassium-containing catalysts, deposited carbon in narrow pores is gasified by supported potassium carbonate, leading to high CO2 production.

          These observations suggest that carbon deposits influence catalyst performance, primarily through deactivation and selectivity changes. However, the literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials themselves, nor does it propose mechanisms, discuss influencing factors, or explore implications for developing novel carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

          该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的意外催化活性。相反，它主要关注碳沉积对氧化锆负载的铁基催化剂在丁烯脱氢反应中的影响。

          文献中的主要观点包括：

          1. 碳沉积物在催化剂表面形成，创造了一个惰性层。
          2. 在氧化锆负载催化剂的狭窄孔隙中，碳沉积迅速发生。
          3. 碳沉积与氧化铁从α-Fe2O3还原为Fe3O4同时发生，增加了对丁二烯的选择性。
          4. 在含钾催化剂中，狭窄孔隙中沉积的碳被负载的碳酸钾气化，导致高CO2产量。

          这些观察结果表明碳沉积物可以影响催化剂性能，主要通过失活和选择性变化。然而，文献并未提供碳基材料本身具有意外催化活性的信息，也没有提出机理、讨论影响因素或探讨开发新型碳基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的意义。
