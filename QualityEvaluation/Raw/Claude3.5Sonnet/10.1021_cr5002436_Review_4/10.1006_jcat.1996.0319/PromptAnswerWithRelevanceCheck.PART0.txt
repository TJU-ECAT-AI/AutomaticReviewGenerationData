[1] "It can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.5-5 h."

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simultaneously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases the selectivity toward butadiene."

[4] "The fact that coke is deposited instantly and is able to grow from the small pores to cover the entire catalyst surface explains the shorter period of time involved in the deactivation than that seen with the magnesia-supported catalysts."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on the deactivation of iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia due to carbon (coke) deposition. 

The document describes how coke deposition occurs rapidly in narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts, leading to faster deactivation compared to magnesia-supported catalysts. This coke formation is seen as detrimental to catalyst performance rather than exhibiting catalytic activity itself.

The literature does not discuss carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or propose mechanisms for carbon-based catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions. It also does not explore the development of novel carbon-based catalysts.

While the document provides insights into carbon deposition behavior and its effects on iron-based catalysts, it does not address the specific question about unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的意外催化活性。相反，它主要关注由于碳(焦炭)沉积导致的氧化锆负载铁基催化剂的失活。

文献描述了焦炭沉积如何迅速发生在氧化锆负载催化剂的窄孔中，导致比氧化镁负载催化剂更快的失活。这种焦炭形成被视为对催化剂性能有害，而不是表现出催化活性。

文献没有讨论碳纳米纤维、混合纳米碳，也没有提出碳基材料在脱氢反应中催化活性的机制。它也没有探讨新型碳基催化剂的开发。

虽然该文献提供了关于碳沉积行为及其对铁基催化剂影响的见解，但它并未涉及碳材料在烷烃脱氢反应中意外催化活性的具体问题。

[1] "It can be seen in Fig. 4 that Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.5–5 h."

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "As can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction."

[4] "This deactivation can also be observed with catalysts which show an inhomogeneous distribution of the iron/potassium phase after preparation. It therefore seems likely that the coverage of the support surface with the iron oxide-potassium oxide phase plays a crucial part in catalyst stability. Possibly the growth of carbon initiates on the bare surface of the zirconia support."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia for butene dehydrogenation. The document mentions carbon deposits as a cause of catalyst deactivation rather than as a catalytically active material.

The literature discusses carbon deposition on Fe/ZrO2 catalysts, leading to deactivation. It suggests that carbon deposits form an inert surface, reducing catalytic activity. The document does not propose mechanisms for unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials or discuss factors influencing such activity.

The paper does mention that carbon deposition may initiate on bare zirconia surfaces not covered by the iron oxide-potassium oxide phase, but this is presented as a cause of deactivation rather than a source of catalytic activity.

In summary, this literature does not provide information on the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. It focuses on the negative impact of carbon deposition on iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia.

该文献并未直接讨论碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。相反，它主要关注氧化锆负载的铁基催化剂在丁烯脱氢反应中的应用。文献提到碳沉积是导致催化剂失活的原因，而不是作为一种具有催化活性的材料。

文献讨论了Fe/ZrO2催化剂上的碳沉积导致失活的问题。它表明碳沉积形成了一个惰性表面，降低了催化活性。文献并未提出碳材料意外催化活性的机理，也没有讨论影响这种活性的因素。

文章确实提到碳沉积可能在未被氧化铁-氧化钾相覆盖的裸露氧化锆表面上开始，但这被认为是导致失活的原因，而不是催化活性的来源。

总之，这篇文献没有提供关于碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中意外催化活性的信息。它主要关注碳沉积对氧化锆负载的铁基催化剂的负面影响。

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "As can be seen in Fig. 8, the low selectivity is related to a high carbon dioxide production. The zirconia-supported catalysts produce carbon dioxide in large quantities, whereas other products, such as propene, show comparable yields."

[4] "This is not attributed to a higher deep oxidation activity of these catalysts, nor to diffusion limitations favoring sequential oxidation of the butadiene. The origin of the high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the deactivation of iron oxide catalysts supported on zirconia due to carbon deposition during butene dehydrogenation.

The document mentions that carbonaceous deposits form on the catalyst surface, leading to deactivation. These deposits are described as inert, suggesting they do not exhibit catalytic activity themselves. 

The literature also notes high CO2 production in zirconia-supported catalysts, which is attributed to carbon deposition in narrow pores rather than unexpected catalytic activity of the carbon deposits. The carbon in the pores is subsequently gasified, likely by supported potassium carbonate.

While this information provides some insight into the behavior of carbon deposits on catalysts during dehydrogenation reactions, it does not address the specific question about unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials or proposed mechanisms for such activity. The focus is primarily on carbon as a deactivating agent rather than a potential catalyst itself.

这篇文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实讨论了在丁烯脱氢过程中，由于碳沉积导致的氧化锌负载氧化铁催化剂的失活。

文献提到，催化剂表面形成碳质沉积物，导致失活。这些沉积物被描述为惰性的，表明它们本身并不表现出催化活性。

文献还指出，在氧化锆负载的催化剂中观察到高CO2产量，这被归因于碳在窄孔中的沉积，而不是碳沉积物意外的催化活性。孔中的碳随后被气化，可能是由负载的碳酸钾引起的。

虽然这些信息提供了一些关于碳沉积物在脱氢反应中催化剂行为的见解，但它并未涉及各种碳基材料意外催化活性或此类活性的提议机制的具体问题。文献主要关注碳作为失活剂，而不是潜在的催化剂本身。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of carbon deposition and its effects on catalyst performance in butene dehydrogenation:

1. Carbon deposition occurs on Fe/ZrO2 catalysts during the reaction, leading to deactivation over time.

2. The deposited carbonaceous material forms an inert catalyst surface.

3. In Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts, carbon deposited in narrow pores is gasified, likely by supported potassium carbonate, leading to high CO2 production.

4. The deposition of carbon and reduction of the active phase (from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4) affect selectivity towards butadiene.

These observations suggest that carbon deposits can influence catalyst performance, but the literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials, proposed mechanisms, or implications for developing novel carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。但是，它确实讨论了碳沉积及其对丁烯脱氢催化剂性能的一些影响：

1. 在反应过程中，Fe/ZrO2催化剂上会发生碳沉积，导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

2. 沉积的碳质材料形成了一个惰性的催化剂表面。

3. 在Fe,K/ZrO2催化剂中，沉积在狭窄孔隙中的碳会被气化，可能是由支持的碳酸钾气化，导致高CO2产量。

4. 碳的沉积和活性相的还原（从α-Fe2O3到Fe3O4）影响了对丁二烯的选择性。

这些观察结果表明，碳沉积可以影响催化剂性能，但该文献并未提供关于碳基材料意外催化活性、提出的机制或对开发新型碳基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的意义的信息。
