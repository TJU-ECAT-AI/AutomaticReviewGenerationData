[1] "It can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.55h."

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "As can be seen in Fig. 8, the low selectivity is related to a high carbon dioxide production. The zirconia-supported catalysts produce carbon dioxide in large quantities, whereas other products, such as propene, show comparable yields."

[4] "This is not attributed to a higher deep oxidation activity of these catalysts, nor to diffusion limitations favoring sequential oxidation of the butadiene. The origin of the high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the deactivation of iron oxide catalysts supported on zirconia due to carbon deposition during butene dehydrogenation.

The document mentions that carbonaceous deposits form on the catalyst surface, leading to deactivation. These deposits are described as inert, suggesting they do not exhibit catalytic activity themselves. 

The literature also notes high CO2 production in zirconia-supported catalysts, which is attributed to carbon deposition in narrow pores rather than unexpected catalytic activity of the carbon deposits. The carbon in the pores is subsequently gasified, likely by supported potassium carbonate.

While this information provides some insight into the behavior of carbon deposits on catalysts during dehydrogenation reactions, it does not address the specific question about unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials or proposed mechanisms for such activity. The focus is primarily on carbon as a deactivating agent rather than a potential catalyst itself.

这篇文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实讨论了在丁烯脱氢过程中，由于碳沉积导致的氧化锌负载氧化铁催化剂的失活。

文献提到，催化剂表面形成碳质沉积物，导致失活。这些沉积物被描述为惰性的，表明它们本身并不表现出催化活性。

文献还指出，在氧化锆负载的催化剂中观察到高CO2产量，这被归因于碳在窄孔中的沉积，而不是碳沉积物意外的催化活性。孔中的碳随后被气化，可能是由负载的碳酸钾引起的。

虽然这些信息提供了一些关于碳沉积物在脱氢反应中催化剂行为的见解，但它并未涉及各种碳基材料意外催化活性或此类活性的提议机制的具体问题。文献主要关注碳作为失活剂，而不是潜在的催化剂本身。
