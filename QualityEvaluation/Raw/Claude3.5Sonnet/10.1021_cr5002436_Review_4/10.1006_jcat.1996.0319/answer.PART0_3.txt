[1] "It can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.5-5 h."

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "As can be seen in Fig. 8, the low selectivity is related to a high carbon dioxide production. The zirconia-supported catalysts produce carbon dioxide in large quantities, whereas other products, such as propene, show comparable yields."

[4] "Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simultaneously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases the selectivity toward butadiene."

[5] "This coke is subsequently gasified, probably by the supported potassium carbonate when the deposited layer has grown to such an extent that it reaches the supported phase."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of carbon deposition and its effects on catalyst performance in butene dehydrogenation:

1. Carbon deposition occurs on Fe/ZrO2 catalysts during the reaction, leading to deactivation over time.

2. The deposited carbonaceous material forms an inert catalyst surface.

3. In Fe,K/ZrO2 catalysts, carbon deposited in narrow pores is gasified, likely by supported potassium carbonate, leading to high CO2 production.

4. The deposition of carbon and reduction of the active phase (from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4) affect selectivity towards butadiene.

These observations suggest that carbon deposits can influence catalyst performance, but the literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials, proposed mechanisms, or implications for developing novel carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。但是，它确实讨论了碳沉积及其对丁烯脱氢催化剂性能的一些影响：

1. 在反应过程中，Fe/ZrO2催化剂上会发生碳沉积，导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

2. 沉积的碳质材料形成了一个惰性的催化剂表面。

3. 在Fe,K/ZrO2催化剂中，沉积在狭窄孔隙中的碳会被气化，可能是由支持的碳酸钾气化，导致高CO2产量。

4. 碳的沉积和活性相的还原（从α-Fe2O3到Fe3O4）影响了对丁二烯的选择性。

这些观察结果表明，碳沉积可以影响催化剂性能，但该文献并未提供关于碳基材料意外催化活性、提出的机制或对开发新型碳基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的意义的信息。
