[1] "It can be seen in Fig. 4 that Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction. For a catalyst containing 3 wt% Fe the butene conversion has decreased from an initial value of about 45% to a level of about 13% after approximately 4.5–5 h."

[2] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "As can be seen in Fig. 2a Fe/ZrO2 catalysts deactivate at 600C during the reaction."

[4] "This deactivation can also be observed with catalysts which show an inhomogeneous distribution of the iron/potassium phase after preparation. It therefore seems likely that the coverage of the support surface with the iron oxide-potassium oxide phase plays a crucial part in catalyst stability. Possibly the growth of carbon initiates on the bare surface of the zirconia support."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia for butene dehydrogenation. The document mentions carbon deposits as a cause of catalyst deactivation rather than as a catalytically active material.

The literature discusses carbon deposition on Fe/ZrO2 catalysts, leading to deactivation. It suggests that carbon deposits form an inert surface, reducing catalytic activity. The document does not propose mechanisms for unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials or discuss factors influencing such activity.

The paper does mention that carbon deposition may initiate on bare zirconia surfaces not covered by the iron oxide-potassium oxide phase, but this is presented as a cause of deactivation rather than a source of catalytic activity.

In summary, this literature does not provide information on the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. It focuses on the negative impact of carbon deposition on iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia.

该文献并未直接讨论碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。相反，它主要关注氧化锆负载的铁基催化剂在丁烯脱氢反应中的应用。文献提到碳沉积是导致催化剂失活的原因，而不是作为一种具有催化活性的材料。

文献讨论了Fe/ZrO2催化剂上的碳沉积导致失活的问题。它表明碳沉积形成了一个惰性表面，降低了催化活性。文献并未提出碳材料意外催化活性的机理，也没有讨论影响这种活性的因素。

文章确实提到碳沉积可能在未被氧化铁-氧化钾相覆盖的裸露氧化锆表面上开始，但这被认为是导致失活的原因，而不是催化活性的来源。

总之，这篇文献没有提供关于碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中意外催化活性的信息。它主要关注碳沉积对氧化锆负载的铁基催化剂的负面影响。
