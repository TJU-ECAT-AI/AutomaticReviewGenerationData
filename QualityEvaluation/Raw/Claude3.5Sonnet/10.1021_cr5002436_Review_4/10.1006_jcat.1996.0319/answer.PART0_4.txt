[1] "It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."

[2] "It can be calculated from thermodynamics (4, 8, 9) that carbon deposition will take place under the conditions used in these experiments."

[3] "Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simultaneously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases the selectivity toward butadiene."

[4] "The origin of the high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts. This coke is subsequently gasified, probably by the supported potassium carbonate when the deposited layer has grown to such an extent that it reaches the supported phase."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some aspects of carbon deposition and its effects on catalyst performance in butene dehydrogenation:

1. Carbon deposits form on the catalyst surface under the reaction conditions, creating an inert surface.

2. Carbon deposition occurs rapidly in narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts.

3. The formation of carbon deposits coincides with the reduction of the active iron oxide phase from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases selectivity towards butadiene.

4. In potassium-containing catalysts, deposited carbon in narrow pores is gasified, likely by supported potassium carbonate, leading to high CO2 production.

These observations suggest that carbon deposits can influence catalyst performance, but the literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials themselves. The mechanisms, influencing factors, and implications for developing novel carbon-based catalysts are not discussed in the given text.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。但是，它确实讨论了碳沉积及其对丁烯脱氢催化剂性能的一些影响：

1. 在反应条件下，碳沉积物在催化剂表面形成，创造了一个惰性表面。

2. 在氧化锆负载催化剂的狭窄孔隙中，碳沉积迅速发生。

3. 碳沉积物的形成与活性氧化铁相从α-Fe2O3还原为Fe3O4同时发生，这增加了对丁二烯的选择性。

4. 在含钾催化剂中，狭窄孔隙中沉积的碳被气化，可能是由负载的碳酸钾引起的，导致高CO2产量。

这些观察结果表明碳沉积物可以影响催化剂性能，但文献并未提供碳基材料本身具有意外催化活性的信息。文中没有讨论机理、影响因素以及开发新型碳基催化剂的意义。
