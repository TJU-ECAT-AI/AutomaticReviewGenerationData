The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about carbon-based materials and their catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The title and brief information provided about the article focus on zinc species stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite for light alkane activation, which is not related to the specific question asked about carbon-based catalysts. Without additional relevant information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the question based solely on the given literature.

给出的文献中没有任何与回答碳基材料及其在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性相关的信息。文章的标题和简要信息主要关注稳定在ZSM-5分子筛中的锌物种对轻烷烃的活化，这与所问及的碳基催化剂的具体问题无关。在没有额外相关信息的情况下，仅凭所给文献无法对该问题提供准确的回答。
