The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about carbon-based materials and their catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to be a title and citation information for an article about zinc species in ZSM-5 zeolite, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. There is insufficient content provided to address the specific aspects of carbon-based catalysts, their mechanisms, influencing factors, or implications for catalyst development as asked in the question.

所提供的文献中没有任何与回答关于碳基材料及其在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性的问题相关的信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于ZSM-5沸石中锌物种的文章的标题和引用信息，与问题所涉及的主题无关。提供的内容不足以解答问题中所询问的碳基催化剂的具体方面、其机理、影响因素或对催化剂开发的影响。
