Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These materials are active for the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen, representing an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

The proposed mechanism involves organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. Unpaired electrons present in these radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation. The recombination of extracted H atoms could then occur in a way that replenishes the source of unpaired electrons.

Temperature plays a crucial role in influencing the catalytic activity of these carbon-based materials. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form and encapsulate the catalyst particles. These structures show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to the disordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures.

The surface chemistry of the carbon-based catalysts is also important. The degree of graphitization and the presence of specific functional groups can affect the catalytic performance. Highly ordered materials with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons tend to show higher activity.

This phenomenon has significant implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. Carbon-based catalysts show promising performance in terms of conversion, yield, and selectivity, comparable to traditional metal oxide catalysts. Moreover, they exhibit better stability, with no observed deactivation over the investigated timescale, in contrast to rapid deactivation seen at lower temperatures with conventional catalysts.

These findings open up new possibilities for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improved industrial processes and reduced catalyst deactivation issues.

碳基材料，包括积碳沉积物和碳纳米纤维（CNFs），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这些材料在无气相氧的情况下对丁烷的脱氢具有活性，代表了脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的一类重要的新型潜在催化剂。

提出的机制涉及与碳质材料相关的有机自由基。这些自由基中存在的未配对电子可能能够从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子，从而导致脱氢。提取的H原子的重组可能以一种补充未配对电子源的方式发生。

温度在影响这些碳基材料的催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用。在高反应温度下，高度有序的导电多芳烃网络形成并包覆催化剂颗粒。这些结构与在较低温度下形成的无序碳沉积物相比，表现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。

碳基催化剂的表面化学性质也很重要。石墨化程度和特定官能团的存在可以影响催化性能。具有更高浓度未配对电子的高度有序材料往往表现出更高的活性。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。碳基催化剂在转化率、产率和选择性方面表现出令人满意的性能，可与传统金属氧化物催化剂相媲美。此外，它们表现出更好的稳定性，在研究的时间尺度内没有观察到失活，这与传统催化剂在较低温度下的快速失活形成鲜明对比。

这些发现为设计更高效、更稳定的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂开辟了新的可能性，有望改进工业过程并减少催化剂失活问题。
