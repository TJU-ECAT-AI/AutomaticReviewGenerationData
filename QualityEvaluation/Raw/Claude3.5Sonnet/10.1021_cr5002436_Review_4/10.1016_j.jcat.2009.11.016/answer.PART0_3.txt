Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed in the dehydrogenation of butane without the presence of gas-phase oxygen. 

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. Unpaired electrons in these radicals may extract hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, leading to dehydrogenation. The reaction may then continue through the deposition of new carbonaceous material and the recombination of extracted hydrogen atoms, replenishing the source of unpaired electrons.

Temperature significantly influences the nature and activity of carbon-based catalysts. At high reaction temperatures (e.g., 973 K), highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show high catalytic activity and stability. In contrast, at lower temperatures, the coke is less ordered and consists of discrete molecular units, leaving substantial areas of the catalyst surface exposed.

The surface chemistry of the carbon-based materials also plays a crucial role. The degree of graphitization and the presence of specific functional groups (such as carboxyl groups in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions) can affect catalytic performance.

This phenomenon has significant implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. It suggests that carefully designed and controlled carbon structures could potentially replace or complement traditional metal-based catalysts in certain reactions. The high stability and activity of these carbon-based catalysts, particularly at high temperatures, could lead to more efficient and longer-lasting catalytic systems for industrial applications.

碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物和碳纳米纤维（CNFs），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性。这种现象已在无气相氧存在的情况下的丁烷脱氢反应中被观察到。

这种催化活性的提出机制涉及与碳质材料相关的有机自由基。这些自由基中的未配对电子可能从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子，导致脱氢。反应可能通过沉积新的碳质材料和提取的氢原子重新组合而继续进行，从而补充未配对电子的来源。

温度显著影响碳基催化剂的性质和活性。在高反应温度下（如973 K），形成高度有序的导电多环芳烃网络，包覆催化剂颗粒。这些结构表现出高催化活性和稳定性。相比之下，在较低温度下，焦炭较不有序，由分散的分子单元组成，使催化剂表面的大部分区域暴露。

碳基材料的表面化学性质也起着至关重要的作用。石墨化程度和特定官能团（如氧化脱氢反应中的羧基）的存在可以影响催化性能。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它表明，精心设计和控制的碳结构可能在某些反应中潜在地替代或补充传统的金属基催化剂。这些碳基催化剂在高温下的高稳定性和活性，可能导致工业应用中更高效和更持久的催化系统。
