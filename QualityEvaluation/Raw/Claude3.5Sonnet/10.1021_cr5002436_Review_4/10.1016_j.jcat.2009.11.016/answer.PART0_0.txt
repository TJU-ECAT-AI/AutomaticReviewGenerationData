Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed for both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported CNFs.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve the presence of organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. These radicals may play a role in extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation.

Temperature is a crucial influencing factor. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to the less ordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures.

Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of curved graphene-like sheets in the carbon structures contributing to their catalytic activity. The similarity between the deposited coke and CNFs in terms of structure and catalytic performance supports this idea.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. They show high activity, good selectivity, and notably, do not suffer from rapid deactivation at high temperatures, unlike traditional catalysts at lower temperatures.

This discovery opens up new possibilities for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in industrial processes for the production of alkenes and alkadienes.

碳基材料，包括积碳沉积物和碳纳米纤维（CNFs），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性。这种现象已在反应过程中沉积在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上的碳质材料和未支撑的CNFs中被观察到。

这种催化活性的proposed机制涉及与碳质材料相关的有机自由基的存在。这些自由基可能在从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子的过程中发挥作用，从而导致脱氢。

温度是一个关键的影响因素。在高反应温度下，高度有序的、导电的多环芳烃网络形成，包覆了催化剂颗粒。与低温下形成的无序碳沉积物相比，这些结构表现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。

表面化学特性也起着重要作用，碳结构的石墨化程度和曲面石墨烯状片层的存在都对其催化活性有贡献。沉积的积碳和CNFs在结构和催化性能方面的相似性支持了这一观点。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。碳基催化剂代表了一类重要的新型脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应潜在催化剂。它们表现出高活性、良好的选择性，并且值得注意的是，在高温下不会像传统催化剂在低温下那样快速失活。

这一发现为设计更高效、更稳定的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂开辟了新的可能性，有望改进烯烃和二烯烃生产的工业过程。
