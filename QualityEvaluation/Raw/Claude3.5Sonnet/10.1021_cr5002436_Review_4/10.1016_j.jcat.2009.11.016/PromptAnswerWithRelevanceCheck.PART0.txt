[1] "In this work both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported carbon nanofibres (CNFs) are shown to be active for the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."

[3] "Notably, the deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets. CNFs can be considered as graphene sheets formed into conical sections [27]."

[4] "After 180 min on stream VOx/Al2O3 shows a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%. The corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively."

[5] "Organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material may play a role in the reaction mechanism."

[6] "At high reaction temperatures highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulate the catalyst particle."

[7] "Deactivation of the reaction is not observed in the timescale investigated, in stark contrast to behaviour at lower temperatures where rapid deactivation occurs."

Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed for both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported CNFs.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve the presence of organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. These radicals may play a role in extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation.

Temperature is a crucial influencing factor. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to the less ordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures.

Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of curved graphene-like sheets in the carbon structures contributing to their catalytic activity. The similarity between the deposited coke and CNFs in terms of structure and catalytic performance supports this idea.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. They show high activity, good selectivity, and notably, do not suffer from rapid deactivation at high temperatures, unlike traditional catalysts at lower temperatures.

This discovery opens up new possibilities for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in industrial processes for the production of alkenes and alkadienes.

碳基材料，包括积碳沉积物和碳纳米纤维（CNFs），在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性。这种现象已在反应过程中沉积在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上的碳质材料和未支撑的CNFs中被观察到。

这种催化活性的proposed机制涉及与碳质材料相关的有机自由基的存在。这些自由基可能在从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子的过程中发挥作用，从而导致脱氢。

温度是一个关键的影响因素。在高反应温度下，高度有序的、导电的多环芳烃网络形成，包覆了催化剂颗粒。与低温下形成的无序碳沉积物相比，这些结构表现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。

表面化学特性也起着重要作用，碳结构的石墨化程度和曲面石墨烯状片层的存在都对其催化活性有贡献。沉积的积碳和CNFs在结构和催化性能方面的相似性支持了这一观点。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。碳基催化剂代表了一类重要的新型脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应潜在催化剂。它们表现出高活性、良好的选择性，并且值得注意的是，在高温下不会像传统催化剂在低温下那样快速失活。

这一发现为设计更高效、更稳定的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂开辟了新的可能性，有望改进烯烃和二烯烃生产的工业过程。

This phenomenon has been observed for both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the reaction and unsupported CNFs.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve the formation of highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons at high reaction temperatures. These structures encapsulate the catalyst particles and provide active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material are thought to play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. The unpaired electrons present in these radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation.

Temperature is a key influencing factor in this phenomenon. At high reaction temperatures (e.g., 973 K), the coke deposits become more ordered and graphitic, leading to increased catalytic activity. Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of organic radicals affecting the catalytic performance.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. This discovery opens up new avenues for catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, the ability of these carbon-based catalysts to operate in the absence of gas-phase oxygen offers advantages in terms of process simplification and safety.

Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed in the dehydrogenation of butane without the presence of gas-phase oxygen. 

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. Unpaired electrons in these radicals may extract hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, leading to dehydrogenation. The reaction may then continue through the deposition of new carbonaceous material and the recombination of extracted hydrogen atoms, replenishing the source of unpaired electrons.

Temperature significantly influences the nature and activity of carbon-based catalysts. At high reaction temperatures (e.g., 973 K), highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show high catalytic activity and stability. In contrast, at lower temperatures, the coke is less ordered and consists of discrete molecular units, leaving substantial areas of the catalyst surface exposed.

The surface chemistry of the carbon-based materials also plays a crucial role. The degree of graphitization and the presence of specific functional groups (such as carboxyl groups in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions) can affect catalytic performance.

This phenomenon has significant implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. It suggests that carefully designed and controlled carbon structures could potentially replace or complement traditional metal-based catalysts in certain reactions. The high stability and activity of these carbon-based catalysts, particularly at high temperatures, could lead to more efficient and longer-lasting catalytic systems for industrial applications.

温度显著影响碳基催化剂的性质和活性。在高反应温度下（如973 K），形成高度有序的导电多环芳烃网络，包覆催化剂颗粒。这些结构表现出高催化活性和稳定性。相比之下，在较低温度下，焦炭较不有序，由分散的分子单元组成，使催化剂表面的大部分区域暴露。

碳基材料的表面化学性质也起着至关重要的作用。石墨化程度和特定官能团（如氧化脱氢反应中的羧基）的存在可以影响催化性能。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它表明，精心设计和控制的碳结构可能在某些反应中潜在地替代或补充传统的金属基催化剂。这些碳基催化剂在高温下的高稳定性和活性，可能导致工业应用中更高效和更持久的催化系统。

The proposed mechanism involves organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material.

These structures show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to the disordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures.

The surface chemistry of the carbon-based catalysts is also important. The degree of graphitization and the presence of specific functional groups can affect the catalytic performance. Highly ordered materials with a greater concentration of unpaired electrons tend to show higher activity.

This phenomenon has significant implications for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. Carbon-based catalysts show promising performance in terms of conversion, yield, and selectivity, comparable to traditional metal oxide catalysts. Moreover, they exhibit better stability, with no observed deactivation over the investigated timescale, in contrast to rapid deactivation seen at lower temperatures with conventional catalysts.

These findings open up new possibilities for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improved industrial processes and reduced catalyst deactivation issues.
