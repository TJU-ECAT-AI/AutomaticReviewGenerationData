Carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed in the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. These radicals may play a role in extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation.

Temperature is a crucial influencing factor in the catalytic activity of carbon-based materials. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show higher catalytic activity compared to the less ordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures.

Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of unpaired electrons (paramagnetism) correlating with higher catalytic activity.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. They show comparable activity to traditional metal oxide catalysts, with the added advantage of resistance to deactivation over time.

This discovery opens up new possibilities for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in industrial processes for the production of alkenes and alkadienes.

碳基材料，包括焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维（CNFs）和混合纳米碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意想不到的催化活性。这种现象已在无气相氧存在的丁烷脱氢反应中被观察到。

这种催化活性的提议机制涉及与碳质材料相关的有机自由基。这些自由基可能在从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子的过程中发挥作用，从而导致脱氢。

温度是影响碳基材料催化活性的一个关键因素。在高反应温度下，高度有序的导电多环芳烃网络形成，包覆了催化剂颗粒。这些结构比在较低温度下形成的无序碳沉积物表现出更高的催化活性。

表面化学也起着重要作用，石墨化程度和未配对电子（顺磁性）的存在与更高的催化活性相关。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂的意义重大。碳基催化剂代表了脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的一类重要的新型潜在催化剂。它们显示出与传统金属氧化物催化剂相当的活性，并具有随时间推移不易失活的额外优势。

这一发现为设计更高效、更稳定的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂开辟了新的可能性，有望改进烯烃和二烯烃生产的工业过程。
