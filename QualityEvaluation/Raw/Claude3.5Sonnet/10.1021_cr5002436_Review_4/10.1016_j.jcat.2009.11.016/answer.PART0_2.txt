Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed for both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during the reaction and unsupported CNFs.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve the formation of highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons at high reaction temperatures. These structures encapsulate the catalyst particles and provide active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material are thought to play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. The unpaired electrons present in these radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation.

Temperature is a key influencing factor in this phenomenon. At high reaction temperatures (e.g., 973 K), the coke deposits become more ordered and graphitic, leading to increased catalytic activity. Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of organic radicals affecting the catalytic performance.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. This discovery opens up new avenues for catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, the ability of these carbon-based catalysts to operate in the absence of gas-phase oxygen offers advantages in terms of process simplification and safety.

各种碳基材料，包括积碳沉积物、碳纳米纤维（CNFs）和混合纳米碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这种现象已在反应过程中沉积在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上的碳质材料和非负载CNFs中观察到。

这种催化活性的提议机制涉及在高反应温度下形成高度有序的、导电的多环芳烃网络。这些结构包覆催化剂颗粒并为脱氢反应提供活性位点。与碳质材料相关的有机自由基被认为在反应机理中起着关键作用。这些自由基中存在的未配对电子可能能够从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子，从而导致脱氢。

温度是这一现象的一个关键影响因素。在高反应温度下（例如973 K），积碳沉积物变得更有序和石墨化，导致催化活性增加。表面化学性质也起作用，石墨化程度和有机自由基的存在影响催化性能。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。碳基催化剂代表了脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的一类重要的新型潜在催化剂。这一发现为催化剂设计开辟了新途径，可能导致烷烃脱氢反应更高效和稳定的催化剂。此外，这些碳基催化剂在无气相氧条件下运行的能力在工艺简化和安全性方面提供了优势。
