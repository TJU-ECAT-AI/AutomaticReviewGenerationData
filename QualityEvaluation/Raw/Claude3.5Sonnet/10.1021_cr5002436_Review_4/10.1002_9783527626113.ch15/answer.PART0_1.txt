The given literature does not contain any information about carbon-based materials exhibiting unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on chromia and vanadia catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss carbon-based catalysts or their mechanisms. There is no mention of carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or carbon-based catalysts showing catalytic activity for these reactions. The literature primarily covers the structures, characterization, and performance of chromium and vanadium oxide catalysts, as well as coke formation on these catalysts, but does not address the catalytic activity of carbon materials themselves.
