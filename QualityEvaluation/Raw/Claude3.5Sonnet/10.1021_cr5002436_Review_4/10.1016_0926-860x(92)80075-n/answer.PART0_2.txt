This literature review does not contain any information about carbon-based materials exhibiting catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The document focuses on the aromatization of short-chain alkanes using gallium-modified zeolite catalysts, particularly GaMFI catalysts. It does not discuss carbon materials, coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, or hybrid nanocarbons as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. The mechanisms, influencing factors, and implications of carbon-based catalysts are not addressed in this text. To answer this question, additional sources specifically focused on carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation would be needed.

这篇文献综述不包含任何关于碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出催化活性的信息。该文档主要关注使用镓改性沸石催化剂,特别是GaMFI催化剂,对短链烷烃进行芳构化的研究。它没有讨论碳材料、焦炭沉积物、碳纳米纤维或混合纳米碳作为烷烃脱氢的催化剂。文中未涉及碳基催化剂的机理、影响因素和意义。要回答这个问题,需要其他专门针对烷烃脱氢碳基催化剂的资料。
