[1] "After being used in the dehydrogenation, the catalysts were therefore investigated for carbon deposition using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."

[2] "Evidently, ca. 2 wt.% carbon is sufficient to deactivate a catalyst containing 1.0 wt.% Fe almost completely."

[3] "The carbon content is plotted against the but-1-ene concentration in the feed for the 1.0 wt.% Fe/MgO catalyst in Fig. 13. Agreeing with the lower rate of deactivation, a higher water : but-1-ene ratio clearly leads to lower carbon deposition rates."

[4] "Under conditions where deactivation is minimized, an activation energy for dehydrogenation to buta-1,3-diene of ca. 47 kcal mol- was found. After prolonged deactivation the activation energy decreased to ca. 40 kcal mol-."

[5] "The difference between the value for coked MgO and the value for the coked iron oxide catalyst suggests that that the carbon deposited on both materials is of a different nature."

The literature does not directly address catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on carbon deposition as a deactivation mechanism for iron oxide catalysts supported on magnesium oxide in butene dehydrogenation. 

The study shows that carbon deposition occurs on both the iron oxide catalyst and the magnesium oxide support, leading to catalyst deactivation. The rate of carbon deposition is influenced by factors such as the water:butene ratio in the feed, with higher ratios leading to lower carbon deposition rates.

The nature of the deposited carbon appears to differ between the iron oxide catalyst and the magnesium oxide support, as evidenced by different activation energies after coking. However, the study does not investigate any potential catalytic activity of these carbon deposits.

The literature does not discuss carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or propose mechanisms for carbon-based catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions. It also does not explore the development of carbon-based catalysts for these reactions.

In summary, while this study provides some insights into carbon deposition during dehydrogenation reactions, it does not address the specific aspects of carbon-based catalytic activity mentioned in the question.

这篇文献并未直接讨论碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。相反，它主要关注碳沉积作为氧化铁催化剂在烯烃脱氢过程中的失活机制。

研究表明，碳沉积发生在氧化铁催化剂和氧化镁载体上，导致催化剂失活。碳沉积速率受到进料中水:丁烯比例等因素的影响，较高的比例会导致较低的碳沉积速率。

从结焦后不同的活化能可以看出，沉积在氧化铁催化剂和氧化镁载体上的碳性质似乎不同。然而，该研究并未探讨这些碳沉积物可能具有的催化活性。

文献中没有讨论碳纳米纤维、混合纳米碳，也没有提出碳基材料在脱氢反应中催化活性的机制。它也没有探讨为这些反应开发碳基催化剂。

总之，虽然这项研究提供了一些关于脱氢反应过程中碳沉积的见解，但并未涉及问题中提到的碳基催化活性的具体方面。
