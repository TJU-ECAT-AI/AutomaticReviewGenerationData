[1] "Ordered mesoporous carbons OMC-1 and OMC-2 were synthesized based on organicorganic self-assembly, and CMK-3 was obtained through a hard-templating approach using mesoporous silica SBA-15."

[2] "The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure."

[3] "Mesoporous carbons are much more active than other carbon materials, including CNTs and GC."

[4] "The robust catalytic activity of OMC-x may be related to their abundant surface oxygen groups."

[5] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

[6] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, particularly ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs). These materials show higher activity compared to other carbon materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphite carbon (GC).

The proposed mechanism involves the activation of propane by ketonic C=O groups on the carbon surface. Propylene is produced, leaving hydroxyl groups as intermediates. The reaction cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of these hydroxyl groups back to C=O, releasing molecular hydrogen.

Influencing factors include:

1. Surface chemistry: The abundance of surface oxygen groups, particularly carbonyl/quinone groups, is essential for good catalytic activity.

2. Temperature: Higher temperatures favor the thermal decomposition of hydroxyl groups to C=O, which is thermodynamically favorable.

3. Porosity: The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts enhances mass transport and thermal stability, contributing to their outstanding performance.

This phenomenon has significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. Ordered mesoporous carbons demonstrate high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation without the need for metal deposition or auxiliary steam. This opens up new perspectives for applying ordered mesoporous carbon materials in industrial catalysis, potentially leading to energy savings and improved process efficiency.

各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，特别是有序介孔碳（OMCs）。这些材料与其他碳材料如碳纳米管（CNTs）和石墨碳（GC）相比，显示出更高的活性。

提出的机制涉及碳表面的酮式C=O基团活化丙烷。丙烯被产生，留下羟基作为中间体。反应循环通过这些羟基的热分解回到C=O完成，释放出分子氢。

影响因素包括：

1. 表面化学：表面氧基团的丰富程度，特别是羰基/醌基团，对良好的催化活性至关重要。

2. 温度：更高的温度有利于羟基向C=O的热分解，这在热力学上是有利的。

3. 孔隙度：介孔碳催化剂的大而有序的孔隙结构增强了质量传输和热稳定性，contributing to their outstanding performance.

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。有序介孔碳在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性，无需金属沉积或辅助蒸汽。这为有序介孔碳材料在工业催化中的应用开辟了新的视角，有可能带来能源节约和工艺效率的提高。
