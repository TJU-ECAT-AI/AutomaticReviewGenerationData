Various carbon-based materials, particularly ordered mesoporous carbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, specifically in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These metal-free carbon catalysts show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to conventional metal-supported systems.

The proposed mechanism involves surface oxygen groups, particularly unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups. These groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, allowing them to serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons. In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl groups (COH) as intermediates. The reaction cycle is completed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

Influencing factors include:

1. Surface chemistry: The abundance of surface oxygen groups, especially carbonyl/quinone groups, is essential for good catalytic activity.

2. Temperature: High temperatures are thermodynamically favorable for the decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen.

3. Porosity: The unique structure of large porosity in ordered mesoporous carbons is advantageous for mass transport and thermal stability.

The implications of this phenomenon for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. These findings provide a new perspective for applying ordered mesoporous carbon materials in industrial applications. The high activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts, combined with the absence of auxiliary steam and subsequent energy savings, make them promising for industrial use in propane dehydrogenation processes.

各种碳基材料，特别是有序介孔碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，尤其是在丙烷脱氢制丙烯的反应中。这些无金属碳催化剂与传统的金属负载型催化剂相比，展现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。

提出的机理涉及表面含氧基团，特别是不饱和酮/二酮型羰基和醌基。这些基团在氧原子上具有大量的电子密度，使其能够作为路易斯碱来活化饱和烃。在丙烷脱氢过程中，酮式C=O基团作为电子受体活化丙烷。这产生了丙烯，并留下羟基（COH）作为中间体。反应循环通过COH在高温下热分解为C=O和分子氢而完成。

影响因素包括：

1. 表面化学：表面含氧基团的丰富度，特别是羰基/醌基的存在，对于良好的催化活性至关重要。

2. 温度：高温有利于COH分解为C=O和氢气的热力学过程。

3. 孔隙度：有序介孔碳独特的大孔隙结构有利于质量传输和热稳定性。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂的意义重大。这些发现为有序介孔碳材料在工业应用中的应用提供了新的视角。这些催化剂的高活性、选择性和稳定性，加上无需辅助蒸汽和随之而来的节能效果，使其在工业丙烷脱氢过程中具有很大的应用前景。
