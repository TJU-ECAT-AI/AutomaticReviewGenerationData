[1] "We report here the catalytic performance in the steam-free dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over metal-free ordered mesoporous carbon materials."

[2] "It has been revealed that these ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited, exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the conventional metal-supported systems."

[3] "The robust catalytic activity of OMC-x may be related to their abundant surface oxygen groups."

[4] "Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

[5] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

[6] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

Various carbon-based materials, particularly ordered mesoporous carbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, specifically in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These metal-free carbon catalysts show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to conventional metal-supported systems.

The proposed mechanism involves surface oxygen groups, particularly unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups. These groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, allowing them to serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons. In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl groups (COH) as intermediates. The reaction cycle is completed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

Influencing factors include:

1. Surface chemistry: The abundance of surface oxygen groups, especially carbonyl/quinone groups, is essential for good catalytic activity.

2. Temperature: High temperatures are thermodynamically favorable for the decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen.

3. Porosity: The unique structure of large porosity in ordered mesoporous carbons is advantageous for mass transport and thermal stability.

The implications of this phenomenon for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. These findings provide a new perspective for applying ordered mesoporous carbon materials in industrial applications. The high activity, selectivity, and stability of these catalysts, combined with the absence of auxiliary steam and subsequent energy savings, make them promising for industrial use in propane dehydrogenation processes.

各种碳基材料，特别是有序介孔碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，尤其是在丙烷脱氢制丙烯的反应中。这些无金属碳催化剂与传统的金属负载型催化剂相比，展现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。

提出的机理涉及表面含氧基团，特别是不饱和酮/二酮型羰基和醌基。这些基团在氧原子上具有大量的电子密度，使其能够作为路易斯碱来活化饱和烃。在丙烷脱氢过程中，酮式C=O基团作为电子受体活化丙烷。这产生了丙烯，并留下羟基（COH）作为中间体。反应循环通过COH在高温下热分解为C=O和分子氢而完成。

影响因素包括：

1. 表面化学：表面含氧基团的丰富度，特别是羰基/醌基的存在，对于良好的催化活性至关重要。

2. 温度：高温有利于COH分解为C=O和氢气的热力学过程。

3. 孔隙度：有序介孔碳独特的大孔隙结构有利于质量传输和热稳定性。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂的意义重大。这些发现为有序介孔碳材料在工业应用中的应用提供了新的视角。这些催化剂的高活性、选择性和稳定性，加上无需辅助蒸汽和随之而来的节能效果，使其在工业丙烷脱氢过程中具有很大的应用前景。

[1] "Nanostructured carbon material, i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions, provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane."

[2] "The existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction, since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was performed in the absence of oxygen. However, both CNTs and GC exhibit terrible catalytic performance, which is in accordance with the results of butane dehydrogenation demonstrated by Zhang et al."

[4] "Ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity."

[5] "Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, but their performance varies depending on the type of carbon and reaction conditions. 

Nanostructured carbon materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic carbon (GC), carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions have shown high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of ethylbenzene and butane. However, in the absence of oxygen, CNTs and GC perform poorly in propane dehydrogenation.

Ordered mesoporous carbons, on the other hand, demonstrate much higher catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation even without oxygen. The key factor influencing this activity is the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups on the carbon surface, as confirmed by XPS and TPD results.

The proposed mechanism involves unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups acting as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons. In propane dehydrogenation, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl groups (COH) as intermediates. The reaction cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

Temperature plays a crucial role, as the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures. Surface chemistry, particularly the presence and type of oxygen-containing functional groups, is a critical factor in determining catalytic activity.

These findings have important implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. They suggest that by tailoring the surface chemistry and pore structure of carbon materials, it may be possible to create highly active and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially offering alternatives to traditional metal-based catalysts.

温度起着至关重要的作用，因为COH到C=O和氢的热分解在高温下是热力学有利的。表面化学，特别是含氧官能团的存在和类型，是决定催化活性的关键因素。

这些发现对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它们表明，通过调整碳材料的表面化学和孔结构，可能创造出高活性和高选择性的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂，可能为传统的金属基催化剂提供替代方案。

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, particularly ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs). These materials show higher activity compared to other carbon materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphite carbon (GC).

The proposed mechanism involves the activation of propane by ketonic C=O groups on the carbon surface. Propylene is produced, leaving hydroxyl groups as intermediates. The reaction cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of these hydroxyl groups back to C=O, releasing molecular hydrogen.

Influencing factors include:

1. Surface chemistry: The abundance of surface oxygen groups, particularly carbonyl/quinone groups, is essential for good catalytic activity.

2. Temperature: Higher temperatures favor the thermal decomposition of hydroxyl groups to C=O, which is thermodynamically favorable.

3. Porosity: The large and well-ordered porosity of mesoporous carbon catalysts enhances mass transport and thermal stability, contributing to their outstanding performance.

This phenomenon has significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. Ordered mesoporous carbons demonstrate high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation without the need for metal deposition or auxiliary steam. This opens up new perspectives for applying ordered mesoporous carbon materials in industrial catalysis, potentially leading to energy savings and improved process efficiency.

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms and influencing factors:

1. Active sites: Carbonyl/quinone groups on the carbon surface act as catalytic sites. These groups, particularly unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl and quinone groups, have high electron density at the oxygen atom, allowing them to serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons.

2. Reaction mechanism: In propane dehydrogenation, the ketonic C=O group activates propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl (COH) groups as intermediates. The cycle completes when COH thermally decomposes back to C=O, releasing molecular hydrogen.

3. Temperature influence: High temperatures favor the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen, which is thermodynamically advantageous for the reaction.

4. Surface chemistry: The presence and concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups, especially carbonyl/quinone groups, are crucial for catalytic activity. XPS and TPD results confirm this relationship.

6. Oxidative vs. non-oxidative conditions: While oxygen is typically considered indispensable for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, some carbon materials can catalyze dehydrogenation even in the absence of oxygen.

These findings have significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. They suggest that by tailoring the surface chemistry and pore structure of carbon materials, it's possible to create highly active and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
