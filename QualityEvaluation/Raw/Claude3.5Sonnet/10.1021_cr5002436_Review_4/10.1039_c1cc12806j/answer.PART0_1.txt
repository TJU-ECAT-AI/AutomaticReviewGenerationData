[1] "Nanostructured carbon material, i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions, provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane."

[2] "The existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction, since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was performed in the absence of oxygen. However, both CNTs and GC exhibit terrible catalytic performance, which is in accordance with the results of butane dehydrogenation demonstrated by Zhang et al."

[4] "Ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity."

[5] "Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

[6] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, but their performance varies depending on the type of carbon and reaction conditions. 

Nanostructured carbon materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic carbon (GC), carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions have shown high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of ethylbenzene and butane. However, in the absence of oxygen, CNTs and GC perform poorly in propane dehydrogenation.

Ordered mesoporous carbons, on the other hand, demonstrate much higher catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation even without oxygen. The key factor influencing this activity is the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups on the carbon surface, as confirmed by XPS and TPD results.

The proposed mechanism involves unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups acting as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons. In propane dehydrogenation, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl groups (COH) as intermediates. The reaction cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

Temperature plays a crucial role, as the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures. Surface chemistry, particularly the presence and type of oxygen-containing functional groups, is a critical factor in determining catalytic activity.

These findings have important implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. They suggest that by tailoring the surface chemistry and pore structure of carbon materials, it may be possible to create highly active and selective catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially offering alternatives to traditional metal-based catalysts.

各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，但它们的性能因碳的类型和反应条件而异。

纳米结构碳材料，如碳纳米管(CNTs)、石墨碳(GC)、碳纳米纤维、碳纳米丝和碳洋葱，在乙苯和丁烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中表现出高活性。然而，在无氧条件下，CNTs和GC在丙烷脱氢反应中表现不佳。

相比之下，有序介孔碳即使在无氧条件下也表现出更高的催化活性。XPS和TPD结果证实，碳表面羰基/醌基的存在是获得良好催化活性的关键因素。

proposed机理涉及不饱和酮/二酮型羰基和醌基作为路易斯碱来活化饱和烃。在丙烷脱氢中，酮式C=O基团作为电子受体活化丙烷。这产生丙烯，并留下羟基(COH)作为中间体。反应循环在高温下通过COH热分解为C=O和分子氢而完成。

温度起着至关重要的作用，因为COH到C=O和氢的热分解在高温下是热力学有利的。表面化学，特别是含氧官能团的存在和类型，是决定催化活性的关键因素。

这些发现对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它们表明，通过调整碳材料的表面化学和孔结构，可能创造出高活性和高选择性的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂，可能为传统的金属基催化剂提供替代方案。
