[1] "Nanostructured carbon material, i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions, provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane."

[2] "It has been accepted that the existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction, since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

[3] "Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

[4] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

[5] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to several factors:

1. Nanostructure: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic carbon (GC), carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions have shown high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of ethylbenzene and butane.

2. Surface chemistry: The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups, is crucial for catalytic activity. These groups serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons.

3. Reaction mechanism: In propane dehydrogenation, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. Propylene is produced, leaving hydroxyl (COH) groups as intermediates. The cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

4. Porosity and structure: Ordered mesoporous carbons demonstrate outstanding catalytic performance due to their unique structure with large porosity, which enhances mass transport and provides good thermal stability.

5. Temperature: High temperatures are favorable for the thermal decomposition of COH groups to C=O and hydrogen, which is an essential step in the reaction cycle.

The implications of this phenomenon for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. It suggests that by controlling the nanostructure, surface chemistry, and porosity of carbon materials, it is possible to create highly active and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This opens up new possibilities for designing metal-free catalysts that could potentially replace traditional metal-based catalysts in industrial applications, offering advantages such as lower cost, higher stability, and improved selectivity.

各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，这是由于以下几个因素：

1. 纳米结构：碳纳米管（CNTs）、石墨碳（GC）、碳纳米纤维、碳纳米丝和碳洋葱在乙苯和丁烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出高活性。

2. 表面化学：含氧官能团的存在，特别是酮/二酮型羰基和醌基，对催化活性至关重要。这些基团作为路易斯碱来活化饱和烃。

3. 反应机理：在丙烷脱氢中，酮式C=O基团作为电子受体活化丙烷。生成丙烯，留下羟基（COH）作为中间体。在高温下，COH热分解为C=O和分子氢，完成反应循环。

4. 孔隙度和结构：有序介孔碳表现出优异的催化性能，这归因于其独特的大孔隙结构，有利于物质传输并具有良好的热稳定性。

5. 温度：高温有利于COH基团热分解为C=O和氢气，这是反应循环中的关键步骤。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它表明，通过控制碳材料的纳米结构、表面化学性质和孔隙度，可以创造出用于烷烃脱氢反应的高活性和稳定性催化剂。这为设计无金属催化剂开辟了新的可能性，这些催化剂可能在工业应用中替代传统的金属基催化剂，提供成本更低、稳定性更高和选择性更好的优势。
