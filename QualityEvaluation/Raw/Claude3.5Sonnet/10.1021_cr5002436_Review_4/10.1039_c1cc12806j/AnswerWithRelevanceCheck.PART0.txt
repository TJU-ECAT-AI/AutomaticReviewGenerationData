          [1] "We report here the catalytic performance in the steam-free dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over metal-free ordered mesoporous carbon materials."

[2] "It has been revealed that these ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited, exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the conventional metal-supported systems."

[3] "The robust catalytic activity of OMC-x may be related to their abundant surface oxygen groups."

[4] "Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

[5] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

[6] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

[7] "Nanostructured carbon material, i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions, provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane."

[8] "The existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction, since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

[9] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was performed in the absence of oxygen. However, both CNTs and GC exhibit terrible catalytic performance, which is in accordance with the results of butane dehydrogenation demonstrated by Zhang et al."

[10] "Ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity."

[11] "Ordered mesoporous carbons OMC-1 and OMC-2 were synthesized based on organicorganic self-assembly, and CMK-3 was obtained through a hard-templating approach using mesoporous silica SBA-15."

[12] "The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure."

[13] "Mesoporous carbons are much more active than other carbon materials, including CNTs and GC."

          Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalytic performance varies among different types of carbon materials:

1. Ordered Mesoporous Carbons (OMCs): These materials show the highest catalytic activity and stability, even outperforming conventional metal-supported systems. They can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction without metal deposition or the need for steam.

2. Nanostructured Carbon Materials: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic carbon (GC), carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions show high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of ethylbenzene and butane. However, CNTs and GC perform poorly in propane dehydrogenation without oxygen.

The proposed mechanism for the catalytic activity involves:

1. Surface Chemistry: The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carbonyl/quinone groups, is essential for good catalytic activity. These groups serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons.

2. Reaction Cycle: In propane dehydrogenation, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl groups (COH) as intermediates. The cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

Influencing factors include:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures favor the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen, which is thermodynamically advantageous.

2. Surface Oxygen Groups: The abundance and type of oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon surface significantly affect catalytic activity.

3. Porosity and Structure: The unique structure of ordered mesoporous carbons, with their large porosity, enhances mass transport and thermal stability, contributing to their outstanding performance.

4. Presence of Oxygen: While oxygen is typically necessary for ODH reactions, some carbon materials (particularly OMCs) can catalyze dehydrogenation even in its absence.

These findings have significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. By tailoring the surface chemistry, nanostructure, and porosity of carbon materials, it may be possible to create highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This opens up new possibilities for metal-free catalysts in industrial applications, potentially offering advantages such as lower costs, higher stability, and improved process efficiency in propylene production and other dehydrogenation processes.

          各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，特别是在丙烷脱氢制丙烯的反应中。不同类型的碳材料的催化性能各不相同：

1. 有序介孔碳（OMCs）：这些材料表现出最高的催化活性和稳定性，甚至优于传统的金属负载系统。它们可以在无金属沉积和无需蒸汽的情况下高效催化脱氢反应。

2. 纳米结构碳材料：碳纳米管（CNTs）、石墨碳（GC）、碳纳米纤维、碳纳米丝和碳洋葱在乙苯和丁烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出高活性。然而，在无氧条件下，CNTs和GC在丙烷脱氢中表现不佳。

proposed的催化活性机理包括：

1. 表面化学：含氧官能团的存在，特别是羰基/醌基，对良好的催化活性至关重要。这些基团作为路易斯碱来活化饱和烃。

2. 反应循环：在丙烷脱氢中，酮式C=O基团作为电子受体活化丙烷。这产生丙烯，并留下羟基（COH）作为中间体。反应循环在高温下通过COH热分解为C=O和分子氢而完成。

影响因素包括：

1. 温度：更高的温度有利于COH向C=O和氢的热分解，这在热力学上是有利的。

2. 表面含氧基团：碳表面含氧官能团的丰富度和类型显著影响催化活性。

3. 孔隙度和结构：有序介孔碳独特的大孔隙结构增强了质量传输和热稳定性，contributing to their outstanding performance.

4. 氧气存在：虽然氧气通常是ODH反应所必需的，但一些碳材料（特别是OMCs）即使在无氧条件下也能催化脱氢反应。

这些发现对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。通过调整碳材料的表面化学性质、纳米结构和孔隙度，可能创造出高活性、高选择性和稳定性的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂。这为工业应用中的无金属催化剂开辟了新的可能性，在丙烯生产和其他脱氢过程中可能提供诸如成本更低、稳定性更高和工艺效率提高等优势。
