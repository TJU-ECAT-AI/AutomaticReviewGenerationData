[1] "Nanostructured carbon material, i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions, provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane."

[2] "It has been accepted that the existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction, since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

[3] "The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity. Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

[4] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

[5] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms and influencing factors:

1. Active sites: Carbonyl/quinone groups on the carbon surface act as catalytic sites. These groups, particularly unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl and quinone groups, have high electron density at the oxygen atom, allowing them to serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons.

2. Reaction mechanism: In propane dehydrogenation, the ketonic C=O group activates propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl (COH) groups as intermediates. The cycle completes when COH thermally decomposes back to C=O, releasing molecular hydrogen.

3. Temperature influence: High temperatures favor the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen, which is thermodynamically advantageous for the reaction.

4. Surface chemistry: The presence and concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups, especially carbonyl/quinone groups, are crucial for catalytic activity. XPS and TPD results confirm this relationship.

5. Material structure: Ordered mesoporous carbons show outstanding performance due to their unique structure with large porosity, which enhances mass transport and provides good thermal stability.

6. Oxidative vs. non-oxidative conditions: While oxygen is typically considered indispensable for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, some carbon materials can catalyze dehydrogenation even in the absence of oxygen.

These findings have significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. They suggest that by tailoring the surface chemistry and pore structure of carbon materials, it's possible to create highly active and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This opens up new avenues for designing metal-free catalysts with potential industrial applications in propylene production and other dehydrogenation processes.

各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，这涉及几种机制和影响因素：

1. 活性位点：碳表面的羰基/醌基团充当催化位点。这些基团，特别是不饱和酮/二酮型羰基和醌基，在氧原子处具有高电子密度，使它们能够作为路易斯碱激活饱和烃。

2. 反应机理：在丙烷脱氢中，酮式C=O基团作为电子受体激活丙烷。这产生丙烯，并留下羟基（COH）基团作为中间体。当COH热分解回C=O并释放分子氢时，循环完成。

3. 温度影响：高温有利于COH热分解为C=O和氢气，这在热力学上有利于反应进行。

4. 表面化学：含氧官能团，特别是羰基/醌基的存在和浓度对催化活性至关重要。XPS和TPD结果证实了这种关系。

5. 材料结构：有序介孔碳表现出优异的性能，这归因于其独特的大孔隙结构，增强了质量传输并提供了良好的热稳定性。

6. 氧化vs非氧化条件：虽然氧气通常被认为是氧化脱氢（ODH）反应所必需的，但一些碳材料即使在没有氧气的情况下也能催化脱氢反应。

这些发现对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它们表明，通过调整碳材料的表面化学性质和孔结构，可以创造出高活性和稳定性的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂。这为设计无金属催化剂开辟了新途径，在丙烯生产和其他脱氢过程中具有潜在的工业应用前景。
