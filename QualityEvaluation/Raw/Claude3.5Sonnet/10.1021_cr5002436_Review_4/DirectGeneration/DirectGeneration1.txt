The discovery of unexpected catalytic activity in carbon-based materials has revolutionized our understanding of alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Traditionally overlooked, substances such as coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons have demonstrated remarkable performance in these important chemical processes. This revelation has prompted intensive research into the underlying mechanisms driving their catalytic behavior, with scientists exploring factors such as surface area, porosity, and the presence of heteroatoms. The influence of carbon structure, defects, and functional groups on catalytic activity has become a key focus, leading to new insights into structure-activity relationships. As a result, this newfound knowledge has significant implications for catalyst development, potentially paving the way for more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts in various industrial applications. The exploration of carbon-based catalysts not only challenges conventional wisdom but also opens up exciting possibilities for tailoring catalytic properties through innovative material design and synthesis strategies.
