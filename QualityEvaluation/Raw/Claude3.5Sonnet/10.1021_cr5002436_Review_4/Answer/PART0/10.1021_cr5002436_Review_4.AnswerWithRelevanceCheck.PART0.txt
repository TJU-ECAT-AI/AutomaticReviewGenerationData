          [1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."

[3] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

[6] "The catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability, displaying conversion and selectivity values of 45% and 85%, respectively, after 100 h of time on stream at 600 C."

          Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts: Active in butane dehydrogenation, with highest activity at 700°C due to ordered carbon structure.

2. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs): Catalytically active, with radicals on the coke surface facilitating dehydrogenation.

3. Hybrid nanocarbons: Diamond core with graphitic shell, active in propane dehydrogenation due to ketone groups or structural defects.

4. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems: Active in propane dehydrogenation without steam or oxidants.

Proposed mechanisms and influencing factors:

1. Radical formation on carbon surfaces facilitates dehydrogenation.
2. Temperature significantly affects activity and selectivity.
3. Surface chemistry, including oxygen-containing groups, plays a crucial role.
4. Structural features like defects in graphitic materials contribute to activity.

Implications for catalyst development:

1. Carbon-based catalysts offer cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives.
2. Unexpected activity of coke deposits challenges traditional views on carbon formation.
3. Tunable surface chemistry and structure allow for tailored catalyst design.
4. Some carbon-based catalysts show remarkable long-term stability (e.g., 45% conversion and 85% selectivity after 100h at 600°C).

These findings open new avenues for developing efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, potentially revolutionizing industrial processes in this field.
