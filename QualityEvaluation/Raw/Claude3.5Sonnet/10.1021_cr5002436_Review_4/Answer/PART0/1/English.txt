Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts: Active in butane dehydrogenation, with highest activity at 700°C due to ordered carbon structure.

2. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs): Catalytically active, with radicals on the coke surface facilitating dehydrogenation.

3. Hybrid nanocarbons: Diamond core with graphitic shell, active in propane dehydrogenation due to ketone groups or structural defects.

4. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems: Active in propane dehydrogenation without steam or oxidants.

Proposed mechanisms and influencing factors:

1. Radical formation on carbon surfaces facilitates dehydrogenation.
2. Temperature significantly affects activity and selectivity.
3. Surface chemistry, including oxygen-containing groups, plays a crucial role.
4. Structural features like defects in graphitic materials contribute to activity.

Implications for catalyst development:

2. Unexpected activity of coke deposits challenges traditional views on carbon formation.
3. Tunable surface chemistry and structure allow for tailored catalyst design.
4. Some carbon-based catalysts show remarkable long-term stability (e.g., 45% conversion and 85% selectivity after 100h at 600°C).

These findings open new avenues for developing efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, potentially revolutionizing industrial processes in this field.

Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed for both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported CNFs in the dehydrogenation of butane without the presence of gas-phase oxygen.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. Unpaired electrons present in these radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation. The reaction may then continue through the deposition of new carbonaceous material and the recombination of extracted hydrogen atoms, replenishing the source of unpaired electrons.

Temperature is a crucial influencing factor. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to the less ordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures. Deactivation of the reaction is not observed in the timescale investigated at high temperatures, in stark contrast to behavior at lower temperatures where rapid deactivation occurs.

Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of curved graphene-like sheets in the carbon structures contributing to their catalytic activity. The similarity between the deposited coke and CNFs in terms of structure and catalytic performance supports this idea.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. They show comparable activity to traditional metal oxide catalysts, with the VOx/Al2O3 showing a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%, while the corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively.

This discovery opens up new possibilities for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in industrial processes for the production of alkenes and alkadienes.

The study focuses on the catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. While it doesn't directly address other carbon-based materials like coke deposits or carbon nanofibers, it provides insights into the mechanisms and influencing factors for carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

The proposed mechanisms for the enhanced catalytic activity of NCNTs include:
1. Electron donation: Graphitic nitrogen atoms donate electrons to the carbon structure, improving electron mobility.
2. Oxygen activation: The improved electron mobility promotes the dissociation of gas-phase O2 into more reactive nucleophilic O2 species.
3. Reduced activation energy: Nitrogen doping decreases the overall activation energy of the reaction.
4. Increased propene production: Nitrogen-doped CNTs produce more propene compared to undoped CNTs, with the formation rate proportional to the nitrogen content.

Influencing factors include:
1. Temperature: The study was conducted at a high temperature of 400°C.
2. Surface chemistry: The presence and type of nitrogen atoms (particularly graphitic nitrogen) in the carbon structure significantly affect the catalytic performance. Quinone- and ketone-like functionalities are also active in the ODH reaction.
3. Nitrogen content: Higher nitrogen content leads to increased propane activity and propene selectivity.
4. Surface defects: These serve as sites for oxygen adsorption and activation.

The implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. This research demonstrates that heteroatom doping, particularly with nitrogen, can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of carbon materials. It opens up possibilities for designing metal-free catalysts with tailored electronic properties and improved catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The study suggests that controlling the type and amount of dopants can be a strategy for tuning the catalytic properties of carbon materials.

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The catalytic performance varies among different types of carbon materials:

1. Ordered Mesoporous Carbons (OMCs): These materials show the highest catalytic activity and stability, even outperforming conventional metal-supported systems. They can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction without metal deposition or the need for steam.

2. Nanostructured Carbon Materials: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphitic carbon (GC), carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions show high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of ethylbenzene and butane. However, CNTs and GC perform poorly in propane dehydrogenation without oxygen.

The proposed mechanism for the catalytic activity involves:

1. Surface Chemistry: The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carbonyl/quinone groups, is essential for good catalytic activity. These groups serve as Lewis bases to activate saturated hydrocarbons.

2. Reaction Cycle: In propane dehydrogenation, ketonic C=O groups activate propane as an electron donor. This produces propylene and leaves hydroxyl groups (COH) as intermediates. The cycle completes with the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen at high temperatures.

Influencing factors include:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures favor the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and hydrogen, which is thermodynamically advantageous.

2. Surface Oxygen Groups: The abundance and type of oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon surface significantly affect catalytic activity.

3. Porosity and Structure: The unique structure of ordered mesoporous carbons, with their large porosity, enhances mass transport and thermal stability, contributing to their outstanding performance.

4. Presence of Oxygen: While oxygen is typically necessary for ODH reactions, some carbon materials (particularly OMCs) can catalyze dehydrogenation even in its absence.

These findings have significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts. By tailoring the surface chemistry, nanostructure, and porosity of carbon materials, it may be possible to create highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This opens up new possibilities for metal-free catalysts in industrial applications, potentially offering advantages such as lower costs, higher stability, and improved process efficiency in propylene production and other dehydrogenation processes.

The provided literature does not directly address the unexpected catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Instead, it focuses on the effects of carbon deposition on iron-based catalysts supported on zirconia during butene dehydrogenation reactions.

          Key points from the literature include:

          1. Carbon deposits form on the catalyst surface, creating an inert layer.
          2. Rapid carbon deposition occurs in narrow pores of zirconia-supported catalysts.
          3. Carbon deposition coincides with the reduction of iron oxide from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, increasing selectivity towards butadiene.
          4. In potassium-containing catalysts, deposited carbon in narrow pores is gasified by supported potassium carbonate, leading to high CO2 production.

          These observations suggest that carbon deposits influence catalyst performance, primarily through deactivation and selectivity changes. However, the literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials themselves, nor does it propose mechanisms, discuss influencing factors, or explore implications for developing novel carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
