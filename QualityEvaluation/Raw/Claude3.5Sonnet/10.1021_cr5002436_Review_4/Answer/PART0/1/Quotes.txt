[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."

[3] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

[6] "The catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability, displaying conversion and selectivity values of 45% and 85%, respectively, after 100 h of time on stream at 600 C."

[1] "In this work both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported carbon nanofibres (CNFs) are shown to be active for the dehydrogenation of butane in the absence of gas-phase oxygen."

[2] "Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for DH and ODH reactions."

[3] "Notably, the deposited coke (Fig. 10) can be characterised as curved graphene-like sheets. CNFs can be considered as graphene sheets formed into conical sections [27]."

[4] "After 180 min on stream VOx/Al2O3 shows a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%. The corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively."

[5] "Organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material may play a role in the reaction mechanism."

[6] "At high reaction temperatures highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons encapsulate the catalyst particle."

[7] "Deactivation of the reaction is not observed in the timescale investigated, in stark contrast to behaviour at lower temperatures where rapid deactivation occurs."

[8] "The unpaired electrons present in such radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation."

[9] "As a consequence of the apparent structural similarity between high-temperature coke deposits and CNFs, it was decided to study the activity of CNFs towards n-butane DH."

[1] "In recent years, metal-free catalysis by carbon nanomaterials has drawn a great deal of attention."

[2] "Doping with heteroatoms makes it possible to control the electronic properties and consequential catalytic performance of nanocarbons by introducing electron acceptors or donors."

[3] "Here, we report the first experimental study of the nitrogen doping effect on ODH of propane as a high-temperature probe reaction (400 1C) with the assistance of the chemical kinetics method."

[4] "Both propane activity and propene selectivity were enhanced with the increasing N content. The N dopant was found to speed up the dissociative adsorption of O2 molecules as well as to reduce the overall activation energy."

[5] "The graphitic nitrogen plays a determining role in enhancing their activity by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction."

[6] "When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of propene was produced and the formation rate showed a proportional relationship with the N content."

[7] "The doped samples exhibited a superior activity 1.63.5 times that of undoped CNT."

[8] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O2, promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species."

[9] "Previous studies revealed that the adsorption and activation of gas-phase molecular oxygen occurred at the defects."

[10] "Previous studies revealed that the quinone- and/or ketone-like functionalities were active in ODH reaction."

[11] "The doped N atoms reduce the dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure and finally decrease the reaction order of oxygen"

[1] "We report here the catalytic performance in the steam-free dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over metal-free ordered mesoporous carbon materials."

[2] "It has been revealed that these ordered mesoporous carbons can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, despite there being no metal deposited, exhibiting higher catalytic activity and stability than the conventional metal-supported systems."

[3] "The robust catalytic activity of OMC-x may be related to their abundant surface oxygen groups."

[4] "Unsaturated ketone/diketone-type carbonyl groups and quinone groups have substantial electron density at the oxygen atom, which can serve as Lewis base to activate saturated hydrocarbons."

[5] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, ketonic C=O activates propane as the electron donor. Propylene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. The reaction cycle is closed by the thermal decomposition of COH to C=O and molecular hydrogen, which is thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures."

[6] "The ordered mesoporous carbons showed outstanding catalytic performance, which can also be related to their unique structure of large porosity that is advantageous for mass transport and good thermal stability."

[7] "Nanostructured carbon material, i.e. CNTs, GC, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofilaments, and carbon onions, provided high activity in the ODH reactions of ethylbenzene and butane."

[8] "The existence of oxygen is indispensable for the ODH reaction, since active sites consisting of diketone- and/or ketone-like groups are initially generated during the synthesis and maintained in their oxidation states by contact with the reactant O2."

[9] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was performed in the absence of oxygen. However, both CNTs and GC exhibit terrible catalytic performance, which is in accordance with the results of butane dehydrogenation demonstrated by Zhang et al."

[10] "Ordered mesoporous carbons show much higher catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions. The XPS and TPD results confirm that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups is essential for a good catalytic activity."

[11] "Ordered mesoporous carbons OMC-1 and OMC-2 were synthesized based on organicorganic self-assembly, and CMK-3 was obtained through a hard-templating approach using mesoporous silica SBA-15."

[12] "The activity of the catalyst samples for dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a fixed-bed tubular reactor at atmospheric pressure."

[13] "Mesoporous carbons are much more active than other carbon materials, including CNTs and GC."

"It seems to be characteristic for an inert catalyst surface which is covered by carbonaceous deposits."
          
          "Coke is deposited instantly in the narrow pores. Simultaneously, the active phase is reduced from α-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, which increases the selectivity toward butadiene."
          
          "This coke is subsequently gasified, probably by the supported potassium carbonate when the deposited layer has grown to such an extent that it reaches the supported phase."
          
          "It can be calculated from thermodynamics (4, 8, 9) that carbon deposition will take place under the conditions used in these experiments."
          
          "The origin of the high CO2 production lies in the fact that carbon deposition is taking place in the narrow pores of the zirconia-supported catalysts."
