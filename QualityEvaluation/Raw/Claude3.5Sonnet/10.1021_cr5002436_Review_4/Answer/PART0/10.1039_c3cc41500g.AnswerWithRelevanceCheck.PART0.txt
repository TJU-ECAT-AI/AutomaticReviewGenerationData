          [1] "In recent years, metal-free catalysis by carbon nanomaterials has drawn a great deal of attention."

[2] "Doping with heteroatoms makes it possible to control the electronic properties and consequential catalytic performance of nanocarbons by introducing electron acceptors or donors."

[3] "Here, we report the first experimental study of the nitrogen doping effect on ODH of propane as a high-temperature probe reaction (400 1C) with the assistance of the chemical kinetics method."

[4] "Both propane activity and propene selectivity were enhanced with the increasing N content. The N dopant was found to speed up the dissociative adsorption of O2 molecules as well as to reduce the overall activation energy."

[5] "The graphitic nitrogen plays a determining role in enhancing their activity by speeding up the activation of oxygen and decreasing the overall activation energy of the reaction."

[6] "When doped with nitrogen, a large amount of propene was produced and the formation rate showed a proportional relationship with the N content."

[7] "The doped samples exhibited a superior activity 1.63.5 times that of undoped CNT."

[8] "Graphitic N atoms donate electrons to the graphitic sheet25 and improve the electron mobility from the basal plane to the intermediate O2, promoting the final dissociation of gas-phase O2 to nucleophilic O2 species."

[9] "Previous studies revealed that the adsorption and activation of gas-phase molecular oxygen occurred at the defects."

[10] "Previous studies revealed that the quinone- and/or ketone-like functionalities were active in ODH reaction."

[11] "The doped N atoms reduce the dependence of the reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure and finally decrease the reaction order of oxygen"

          The study focuses on the catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. While it doesn't directly address other carbon-based materials like coke deposits or carbon nanofibers, it provides insights into the mechanisms and influencing factors for carbon-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

The proposed mechanisms for the enhanced catalytic activity of NCNTs include:
1. Electron donation: Graphitic nitrogen atoms donate electrons to the carbon structure, improving electron mobility.
2. Oxygen activation: The improved electron mobility promotes the dissociation of gas-phase O2 into more reactive nucleophilic O2 species.
3. Reduced activation energy: Nitrogen doping decreases the overall activation energy of the reaction.
4. Increased propene production: Nitrogen-doped CNTs produce more propene compared to undoped CNTs, with the formation rate proportional to the nitrogen content.

Influencing factors include:
1. Temperature: The study was conducted at a high temperature of 400°C.
2. Surface chemistry: The presence and type of nitrogen atoms (particularly graphitic nitrogen) in the carbon structure significantly affect the catalytic performance. Quinone- and ketone-like functionalities are also active in the ODH reaction.
3. Nitrogen content: Higher nitrogen content leads to increased propane activity and propene selectivity.
4. Surface defects: These serve as sites for oxygen adsorption and activation.

The implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. This research demonstrates that heteroatom doping, particularly with nitrogen, can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of carbon materials. It opens up possibilities for designing metal-free catalysts with tailored electronic properties and improved catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The study suggests that controlling the type and amount of dopants can be a strategy for tuning the catalytic properties of carbon materials.

          该研究重点关注氮掺杂碳纳米管（NCNTs）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的催化活性。虽然它没有直接涉及其他碳基材料如焦炭沉积物或碳纳米纤维，但它为碳基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的机理和影响因素提供了见解。

NCNTs增强催化活性的提议机制包括：
1. 电子供给：石墨氮原子向碳结构供给电子，提高了电子迁移性。
2. 氧气活化：改善的电子迁移性促进了气相O2解离成更具反应性的亲核O2物种。
3. 降低活化能：氮掺杂降低了反应的整体活化能。
4. 增加丙烯产量：与未掺杂的CNTs相比，氮掺杂的CNTs产生更多丙烯，其生成率与氮含量成正比。

影响因素包括：
1. 温度：研究在400°C的高温下进行。
2. 表面化学：碳结构中氮原子的存在和类型（特别是石墨氮）显著影响催化性能。醌类和酮类功能团在ODH反应中也具有活性。
3. 氮含量：较高的氮含量导致丙烷活性和丙烯选择性增加。
4. 表面缺陷：这些作为氧气吸附和活化的位点。

这项研究对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。它证明了杂原子掺杂，特别是氮掺杂，可以大大提高碳材料的催化性能。这为设计具有定制电子性质和改进催化活性的无金属催化剂用于烷烃脱氢反应开辟了可能性。研究表明，控制掺杂剂的类型和数量可以作为调节碳材料催化性能的策略。
