          Various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. This phenomenon has been observed for both carbonaceous material deposited on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during reaction and unsupported CNFs in the dehydrogenation of butane without the presence of gas-phase oxygen.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity involve organic radicals associated with the carbonaceous material. Unpaired electrons present in these radicals may be capable of extracting hydrogen atoms from the n-butane feed, resulting in dehydrogenation. The reaction may then continue through the deposition of new carbonaceous material and the recombination of extracted hydrogen atoms, replenishing the source of unpaired electrons.

Temperature is a crucial influencing factor. At high reaction temperatures, highly ordered, conducting networks of polyaromatic hydrocarbons form, encapsulating the catalyst particles. These structures show higher catalytic activity and stability compared to the less ordered carbon deposits formed at lower temperatures. Deactivation of the reaction is not observed in the timescale investigated at high temperatures, in stark contrast to behavior at lower temperatures where rapid deactivation occurs.

Surface chemistry also plays a role, with the degree of graphitization and the presence of curved graphene-like sheets in the carbon structures contributing to their catalytic activity. The similarity between the deposited coke and CNFs in terms of structure and catalytic performance supports this idea.

The implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant. Carbon-based catalysts represent an important new class of potential catalysts for dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. They show comparable activity to traditional metal oxide catalysts, with the VOx/Al2O3 showing a conversion of 50%, a yield of C4 DH products of 40%, a selectivity to 1-butene of 48% and to 1,3-butadiene of 32%, while the corresponding values for the CNF are 41%, 32%, 46% and 34%, respectively.

This discovery opens up new possibilities for the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improvements in industrial processes for the production of alkenes and alkadienes.

          各种碳基材料，包括积碳沉积物、碳纳米纤维（CNFs）和混合纳米碳，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这种现象已在反应过程中沉积在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上的碳质材料和非负载CNFs中观察到，特别是在无气相氧存在的丁烷脱氢反应中。

这种催化活性的提议机制涉及与碳质材料相关的有机自由基。这些自由基中存在的未配对电子可能能够从正丁烷原料中提取氢原子，从而导致脱氢。反应可能通过沉积新的碳质材料和提取的氢原子重新组合而继续进行，从而补充未配对电子的来源。

温度是一个关键的影响因素。在高反应温度下，高度有序的、导电的多环芳烃网络形成，包覆了催化剂颗粒。与低温下形成的无序碳沉积物相比，这些结构表现出更高的催化活性和稳定性。在研究的时间尺度内，高温下没有观察到反应失活，这与低温下快速失活的行为形成鲜明对比。

表面化学特性也起着重要作用，碳结构的石墨化程度和曲面石墨烯状片层的存在都对其催化活性有贡献。沉积的积碳和CNFs在结构和催化性能方面的相似性支持了这一观点。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义。碳基催化剂代表了一类重要的新型脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应潜在催化剂。它们显示出与传统金属氧化物催化剂相当的活性，VOx/Al2O3显示50%的转化率，40%的C4 DH产物产率，48%的1-丁烯选择性和32%的1,3-丁二烯选择性，而CNF的相应值分别为41%、32%、46%和34%。

这一发现为设计更高效、更稳定的烷烃脱氢反应催化剂开辟了新的可能性，有望改进烯烃和二烯烃生产的工业过程。
