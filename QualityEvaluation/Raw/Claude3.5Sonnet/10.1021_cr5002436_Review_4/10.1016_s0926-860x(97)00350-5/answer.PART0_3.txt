[1] "Fujimoto in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane [15]. However, promotion of dehydrogenation activity with iron oxides has not been reported."

[2] "Carbon deposition was reduced under a carbon dioxide stream as compared with the reaction under argon atmosphere."

[3] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."

[4] "This result indicates that the deposited carbon seems to be gasied with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be suppressed."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some related points:

1. The activated carbon support itself showed some catalytic activity for isobutane dehydrogenation, which was further enhanced by iron loading.

2. Carbon deposition occurred during the reaction, leading to catalyst deactivation. This suggests that carbon-based materials can influence the reaction, though not necessarily in a positive way.

3. The presence of CO2 reduced carbon deposition compared to an argon atmosphere, possibly through gasification of deposited carbon or suppression of carbon deposition on Fe3O4.

4. The literature does not propose specific mechanisms for carbon-based catalytic activity or discuss factors like temperature and surface chemistry in detail for this phenomenon.

5. There is no direct discussion of carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or novel carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation in this literature.

Overall, while the document acknowledges some influence of carbon-based materials on the dehydrogenation reaction, it does not provide comprehensive information on their unexpected catalytic activity or implications for developing new carbon-based catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。但是，它确实提到了一些相关的要点：

1. 活性炭载体本身对异丁烷脱氢显示出一定的催化活性，这种活性通过负载铁进一步增强。

2. 在反应过程中发生了碳沉积，导致催化剂失活。这表明碳基材料可以影响反应，尽管不一定是以正面的方式。

3. 与氩气氛相比，CO2的存在减少了碳沉积，可能是通过气化沉积的碳或抑制Fe3O4上的碳沉积。

4. 文献没有针对碳基催化活性提出具体的机理，也没有详细讨论这一现象中温度和表面化学等因素的影响。

5. 文献中没有直接讨论碳纳米纤维、混合纳米碳或用于烷烃脱氢的新型碳基催化剂。

总的来说，虽然文献承认碳基材料对脱氢反应有一定影响，但并未提供关于它们意外催化活性或开发新型碳基催化剂的影响的全面信息。
