[1] "Dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was successufully carried out on iron loaded activated carbon catalyst at 873 K."

[2] "Carbon deposition was reduced under a carbon dioxide stream as compared with the reaction under argon atmosphere."

[3] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."

[4] "This result indicates that the deposited carbon seems to be gasied with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be suppressed."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the use of activated carbon as a support for iron catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. The study focuses on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts rather than the catalytic activity of carbon materials themselves.

The paper mentions carbon deposition as a factor affecting catalyst performance, but it does not describe this as a catalytically active component. Instead, carbon deposition is presented as a problem that leads to catalyst deactivation. The presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction atmosphere was found to reduce carbon deposition compared to an argon atmosphere.

The literature does not propose mechanisms for catalytic activity of carbon materials, nor does it discuss carbon nanofibers or hybrid nanocarbons. The focus is on the iron species (particularly magnetite Fe3O4) as the active catalytic component, with activated carbon serving as a support.

Temperature is mentioned as an influencing factor, with reactions typically carried out at 873 K. The surface chemistry of the catalyst is discussed in terms of iron species formation and transformation, rather than carbon surface properties.

Overall, this literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation. It instead focuses on iron catalysts supported on activated carbon for isobutane dehydrogenation, with carbon deposition being a side effect rather than a catalytically active component.

这篇文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实讨论了活性炭作为铁催化剂载体在异丁烷脱氢中的应用。这项研究主要关注铁负载的活性炭催化剂，而不是碳材料本身的催化活性。

文章提到碳沉积是影响催化剂性能的一个因素，但并未将其描述为具有催化活性的组分。相反，碳沉积被视为导致催化剂失活的一个问题。研究发现，与氩气氛相比，反应气氛中存在二氧化碳可以减少碳沉积。

文献并未提出碳材料催化活性的机理，也没有讨论碳纳米纤维或混合纳米碳。研究重点关注铁物种（特别是磁铁矿Fe3O4）作为活性催化组分，而活性炭仅作为载体。

温度被提及为一个影响因素，反应通常在873 K下进行。对于催化剂的表面化学性质的讨论主要围绕铁物种的形成和转化，而非碳表面性质。

总的来说，这篇文献并未提供有关碳基材料在烷烃脱氢中意外催化活性的信息。它主要关注活性炭负载的铁催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的应用，其中碳沉积被视为一种副作用，而非具有催化活性的组分。
