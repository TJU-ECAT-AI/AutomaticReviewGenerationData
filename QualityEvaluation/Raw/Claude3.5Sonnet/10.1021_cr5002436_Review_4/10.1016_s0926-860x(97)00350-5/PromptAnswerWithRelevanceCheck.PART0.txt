[1] "Dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was successufully carried out on iron loaded activated carbon catalyst at 873 K."

[2] "Carbon deposition was reduced under a carbon dioxide stream as compared with the reaction under argon atmosphere."

[3] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."

[4] "This result indicates that the deposited carbon seems to be gasied with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be suppressed."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the use of activated carbon as a support for iron catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. The study focuses on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts rather than the catalytic activity of carbon materials themselves.

The paper mentions carbon deposition as a factor affecting catalyst performance, but it does not describe this as a catalytically active component. Instead, carbon deposition is presented as a problem that leads to catalyst deactivation. The presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction atmosphere was found to reduce carbon deposition compared to an argon atmosphere.

The literature does not propose mechanisms for catalytic activity of carbon materials, nor does it discuss carbon nanofibers or hybrid nanocarbons. The focus is on the iron species (particularly magnetite Fe3O4) as the active catalytic component, with activated carbon serving as a support.

Temperature is mentioned as an influencing factor, with reactions typically carried out at 873 K. The surface chemistry of the catalyst is discussed in terms of iron species formation and transformation, rather than carbon surface properties.

Overall, this literature does not provide information on unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation. It instead focuses on iron catalysts supported on activated carbon for isobutane dehydrogenation, with carbon deposition being a side effect rather than a catalytically active component.

这篇文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实讨论了活性炭作为铁催化剂载体在异丁烷脱氢中的应用。这项研究主要关注铁负载的活性炭催化剂，而不是碳材料本身的催化活性。

文章提到碳沉积是影响催化剂性能的一个因素，但并未将其描述为具有催化活性的组分。相反，碳沉积被视为导致催化剂失活的一个问题。研究发现，与氩气氛相比，反应气氛中存在二氧化碳可以减少碳沉积。

文献并未提出碳材料催化活性的机理，也没有讨论碳纳米纤维或混合纳米碳。研究重点关注铁物种（特别是磁铁矿Fe3O4）作为活性催化组分，而活性炭仅作为载体。

温度被提及为一个影响因素，反应通常在873 K下进行。对于催化剂的表面化学性质的讨论主要围绕铁物种的形成和转化，而非碳表面性质。

总的来说，这篇文献并未提供有关碳基材料在烷烃脱氢中意外催化活性的信息。它主要关注活性炭负载的铁催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的应用，其中碳沉积被视为一种副作用，而非具有催化活性的组分。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the use of activated carbon as a support for iron catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. The study focuses on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts rather than the catalytic activity of carbon materials themselves.

The paper mentions carbon deposition as a factor affecting catalyst performance, but does not explore it as a catalytically active material. The research shows that carbon dioxide can reduce carbon deposition compared to reactions under argon, suggesting that carbon deposits may be gasified or their formation suppressed in a CO2 atmosphere.

While this information provides some insights into carbon behavior during the reaction, it does not address the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials, proposed mechanisms, or influencing factors for carbon-based catalysts as asked in the question. The study's focus is primarily on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts rather than novel carbon-based catalytic materials.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实讨论了活性炭作为铁催化剂载体在异丁烷脱氢中的应用。这项研究主要集中在负载铁的活性炭催化剂上，而不是碳材料本身的催化活性。

文章提到碳沉积是影响催化剂性能的一个因素，但并未将其作为一种具有催化活性的材料进行探讨。研究表明，与在氩气下反应相比，二氧化碳可以减少碳沉积，这表明在CO2气氛中，碳沉积物可能被气化或其形成被抑制。

虽然这些信息提供了一些关于反应过程中碳行为的见解，但它并没有回答问题中提到的碳材料意外催化活性、提出的机制或影响碳基催化剂的因素。该研究主要关注负载铁的活性炭催化剂，而不是新型碳基催化材料。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some related observations regarding carbon deposits and their interaction with the catalyst and reaction environment:

1. The study primarily focuses on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than on the catalytic activity of carbon materials themselves.

2. Carbon deposition was observed to occur during the reaction, leading to catalyst deactivation and reduced surface area.

3. The presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction atmosphere reduced carbon deposition compared to reactions conducted in argon.

4. The mechanism for reduced carbon deposition in CO2 atmosphere is suggested to be either gasification of deposited carbon or suppression of carbon deposition on Fe3O4.

5. The study does not propose specific mechanisms for unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials, nor does it explore the influence of factors like temperature and surface chemistry on such activity.

6. The research does not discuss implications for developing novel carbon-based catalysts, as its focus is on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts.

In conclusion, while the study provides some insights into carbon deposition during alkane dehydrogenation, it does not directly address the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials or their potential as novel catalysts for these reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实提到了一些关于碳沉积物及其与催化剂和反应环境相互作用的相关观察：

1. 该研究主要关注铁负载活性炭催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢，而不是碳材料本身的催化活性。

2. 观察到在反应过程中发生碳沉积，导致催化剂失活和表面积减少。

3. 反应气氛中存在二氧化碳可减少碳沉积，相比于在氩气中进行的反应。

4. 在CO2气氛中减少碳沉积的机制被认为可能是沉积碳的气化或抑制Fe3O4上的碳沉积。

5. 该研究没有提出碳材料意外催化活性的具体机制，也没有探讨温度和表面化学等因素对这种活性的影响。

6. 该研究没有讨论开发新型碳基催化剂的影响，因为其重点是铁负载活性炭催化剂。

总之，虽然该研究提供了一些关于烷烃脱氢过程中碳沉积的见解，但并未直接讨论碳基材料的意外催化活性或它们作为这些反应的新型催化剂的潜力。

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some related points:

1. The activated carbon support itself showed some catalytic activity for isobutane dehydrogenation, which was further enhanced by iron loading.

2. Carbon deposition occurred during the reaction, leading to catalyst deactivation. This suggests that carbon-based materials can influence the reaction, though not necessarily in a positive way.

3. The presence of CO2 reduced carbon deposition compared to an argon atmosphere, possibly through gasification of deposited carbon or suppression of carbon deposition on Fe3O4.

4. The literature does not propose specific mechanisms for carbon-based catalytic activity or discuss factors like temperature and surface chemistry in detail for this phenomenon.

5. There is no direct discussion of carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or novel carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation in this literature.

Overall, while the document acknowledges some influence of carbon-based materials on the dehydrogenation reaction, it does not provide comprehensive information on their unexpected catalytic activity or implications for developing new carbon-based catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。但是，它确实提到了一些相关的要点：

1. 活性炭载体本身对异丁烷脱氢显示出一定的催化活性，这种活性通过负载铁进一步增强。

2. 在反应过程中发生了碳沉积，导致催化剂失活。这表明碳基材料可以影响反应，尽管不一定是以正面的方式。

3. 与氩气氛相比，CO2的存在减少了碳沉积，可能是通过气化沉积的碳或抑制Fe3O4上的碳沉积。

4. 文献没有针对碳基催化活性提出具体的机理，也没有详细讨论这一现象中温度和表面化学等因素的影响。

5. 文献中没有直接讨论碳纳米纤维、混合纳米碳或用于烷烃脱氢的新型碳基催化剂。

总的来说，虽然文献承认碳基材料对脱氢反应有一定影响，但并未提供关于它们意外催化活性或开发新型碳基催化剂的影响的全面信息。

[1] "Fujimoto in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane [15]. However, promotion of dehydrogenation activity with iron oxides has not been reported."

[2] "The surface area of the catalyst decreased from 935650 m2/g after the reaction for 5 h at 923 K. The decrease in the surface area increased with increasing reaction temperature. Such decreases in the surface area could be attributed to the carbon deposition to the catalyst as reported previously [14]."

[3] "Carbon deposition on the catalyst during dehydrogenation, must be considered from the reduction in the surface area during the reaction, in both argon and carbon dioxide atmosphere."

[4] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K). This result indicates that the deposited carbon seems to be gasified with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be suppressed."
