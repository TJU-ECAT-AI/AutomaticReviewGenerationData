[1] "Fujimoto in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane [15]. However, promotion of dehydrogenation activity with iron oxides has not been reported."

[2] "The surface area of the catalyst decreased from 935650 m2/g after the reaction for 5 h at 923 K. The decrease in the surface area increased with increasing reaction temperature. Such decreases in the surface area could be attributed to the carbon deposition to the catalyst as reported previously [14]."

[3] "Carbon deposition on the catalyst during dehydrogenation, must be considered from the reduction in the surface area during the reaction, in both argon and carbon dioxide atmosphere."

[4] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K). This result indicates that the deposited carbon seems to be gasified with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be suppressed."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does mention some related points:

1. The study focuses on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than pure carbon-based catalysts.

2. Carbon deposition is observed during the reaction, which leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced surface area.

3. The presence of carbon dioxide reduces carbon deposition compared to reactions in an argon atmosphere.

4. The mechanism of carbon deposition and its effect on catalytic activity is not fully explained in this study.

5. The literature does not discuss carbon nanofibers, hybrid nanocarbons, or unexpected catalytic activity of carbon-based materials.

To fully answer the question, additional research on the specific catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation would be necessary.

这篇文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。但是，它确实提到了一些相关的要点：

1. 这项研究主要关注铁负载活性炭催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的应用，而不是纯碳基催化剂。

2. 在反应过程中观察到碳沉积现象，这导致了催化剂失活和表面积减小。

3. 与在氩气氛围下相比，二氧化碳的存在减少了碳沉积。

4. 这项研究并未完全解释碳沉积的机理及其对催化活性的影响。

5. 文献中没有讨论碳纳米纤维、混合纳米碳或碳基材料的意外催化活性。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢中的特定催化活性进行额外的研究。
