[1] "Dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was successufully carried out on iron loaded activated carbon catalyst at 873 K."

[2] "Carbon deposition was reduced under a carbon dioxide stream as compared with the reaction under argon atmosphere."

[3] "The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol carbon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature (873 K)."

[4] "This result indicates that the deposited carbon seems to be gasied with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be suppressed."

The literature does not directly address the catalytic activity of various carbon-based materials in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss the use of activated carbon as a support for iron catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation. The study focuses on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts rather than the catalytic activity of carbon materials themselves.

The paper mentions carbon deposition as a factor affecting catalyst performance, but does not explore it as a catalytically active material. The research shows that carbon dioxide can reduce carbon deposition compared to reactions under argon, suggesting that carbon deposits may be gasified or their formation suppressed in a CO2 atmosphere.

While this information provides some insights into carbon behavior during the reaction, it does not address the unexpected catalytic activity of carbon materials, proposed mechanisms, or influencing factors for carbon-based catalysts as asked in the question. The study's focus is primarily on iron-loaded activated carbon catalysts rather than novel carbon-based catalytic materials.

该文献并未直接讨论各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化活性。然而，它确实讨论了活性炭作为铁催化剂载体在异丁烷脱氢中的应用。这项研究主要集中在负载铁的活性炭催化剂上，而不是碳材料本身的催化活性。

文章提到碳沉积是影响催化剂性能的一个因素，但并未将其作为一种具有催化活性的材料进行探讨。研究表明，与在氩气下反应相比，二氧化碳可以减少碳沉积，这表明在CO2气氛中，碳沉积物可能被气化或其形成被抑制。

虽然这些信息提供了一些关于反应过程中碳行为的见解，但它并没有回答问题中提到的碳材料意外催化活性、提出的机制或影响碳基催化剂的因素。该研究主要关注负载铁的活性炭催化剂，而不是新型碳基催化材料。
