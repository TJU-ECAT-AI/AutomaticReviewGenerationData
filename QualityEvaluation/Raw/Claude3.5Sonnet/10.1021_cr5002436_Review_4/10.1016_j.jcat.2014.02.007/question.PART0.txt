a b s t r a c t
Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the
monomolecular propane reaction were investigated. [Fe]ZSM-5 (MFI) samples with Si/Fe ratios of 26
and 48, and [Fe]beta zeolite (BEA) with Si/Fe ratio of 15 were synthesized and characterized using X-
ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and ultravioletvisible (UV/Visible) spectroscopy. Unit cell
volumes, determined using XRD, were used to monitor the presence of Fe in the framework and the
migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions. Most of the Fe atoms remain in
framework positions after mild calcination (753 K in air), but most of the Fe species migrate to extra-
framework positions after steaming at 973 K. Migration of Fe species from framework to extra-frame-
work positions can occur during the monomolecular propane reaction as well. Isolated framework Fe
sites are the most important sites for hydrocarbon conversion even though Fe species in extra-framework
positions also showed catalytic activity for dehydrogenation. The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly
20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio
(26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36). The activa-
tion energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5. A redox catalytic
cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the
formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the
observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.

1. Introduction
Zeolites are aluminosilicate materials that contain tetrahedral
Si4+ and Al3+ as framework atoms. In the acid form of aluminosilicate
zeolites, the negative charge of the alumina tetrahedra ([AlO4]) is
balanced by a proton (H+), forming a bridging hydroxyl group (Si
OHAl) or Brnsted acid site (BAS). Other trivalent elements such
as B3+, Fe3+, and Ga3+ can be used for isomorphous substitution of
Al3+. Aluminosilicate zeolites are currently used for a number of
industrially important Brnsted acid-catalyzed reactions [16],
and their Fe-containing counterparts are of interest for performing
various reactions such as olefin oligomerization and isomerization
of m-xylene[713]. Previous reports regarding the dehydrogenation
of para- and ortho-ethyltoluenes have claimed that the reaction
occurs on Fe atoms in the zeolite framework [1214]. Kresnawahj-
uesa et al. reported that H-[Fe]ZSM-5 could catalyze olefin oligomer-
ization, with less hydride transfer and coke formation than
H-[Al]ZSM-5 [8]. Propyl acetates were formed with high selectivity
by acylation of propene over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 [7]. It was also reported
that isomerization of m-xylene is catalyzed by BAS in Fe-containing
zeolites, and the conversion rates and selectivity are comparable to
those exhibited by H-[Al] zeolites [10,11].
The strength of acid sites can be measured using heats of
adsorption of bases such as ammonia, pyridine, and acetonitrile.
The heats of adsorption for ammonia and pyridine are similar for
both H-[Fe] and H-[Al]ZSM-5 (145 kJ mol1 for ammonia and
195200 kJ mol1 for pyridine), and the heat of adsorption of
acetonitrile for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (95 kJ mol1) is slightly less than that
for H-[Al]ZSM-5 (110 kJ mol1) [9]. These heats of adsorption
suggest that the deprotonation enthalpy of the H-[Al] zeolites
and H-[Fe] zeolites is similar and the strength of acid sites is also
similar. These reaction results over H-[Fe] zeolites with similar
acidity than H-[Al] zeolites, lead to the question of whether typical
protolytic chemistry, responsible for catalytic activity in the con-
version of hydrocarbons over H-[Al] zeolites, is also the dominant
reaction mechanism on H-[Fe] zeolites.
Conversion of small alkanes has been used frequently as a model
reaction because the cleavage of CC and CH bonds in hydrocar-
bons is a problem of fundamental scientific interest. Product distri-
butions tend to be simple and the results are easy to model and
quantify. Alkane activation on acid sites in zeolites can proceed

through bimolecular and monomolecular pathways. The bimolecu-
lar pathway involves hydride transfer between an alkane and an ad-
sorbed carbenium ion when the concentration of surface species is
high. On the contrary, the monomolecular pathway (protolytic
mechanism), involving the formation of alkanium ions [4,1519],
is kinetically dominant at high temperatures (773 K), low alkane
partial pressure, and low conversion (<2%). The monomolecular
alkane reaction proceeds throughonly two reaction channels: crack-
ing and dehydrogenation. Through the protolytic mechanism,
H-[Al]ZSM-5 samples exhibit higher selectivity for cracking of pro-
pane than for dehydrogenation by a factor of about three [20]. In
contrast,
dehydrogenation
selectivity
is
enhanced
(cracking-
to-dehydrogenation ratio 1) in H-[Al]ZSM-5 after thermal dehydr-
oxylation [20]. Lower apparent activation energies for cracking
(from 184 kJ mol1 to 144 kJ mol1) and for dehydrogenation (from
187 kJ mol1 to 127 kJ mol1) are also observed [20].
In this contribution, we investigate the catalytic activity and
selectivity for the monomolecular propane reaction over H-
[Fe]ZSM-5 with different Si/Fe ratios (26 and 48) and over H-[Fe]beta
zeolite (Si/Fe ratio, 15). The migration of Fe species from framework
to extra-framework positions was monitored using UV/Vis spectros-
copy and using the volume of the unit cell determined using XRD
patterns. Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to
propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when
compared to H-[Al] zeolites. The results suggest that a redox mech-
anism is a plausible explanation for the hydrocarbon conversion on
[Fe] zeolites reported here, as had been hypothesized earlier for
Al-containing zeolites [20,21]. The viability of [Fe] zeolite for dehy-
drogenation of propane was examined and compared to chromia
catalysts.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis
[Fe]ZSM-5: [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites were synthesized using a proce-
dure reported by Brckner et al. [22] [Fe]ZSM-5 with different
framework compositions were synthesized using the following
molar batch compositions: (1) 30 Na2O:0.38 Fe2O3:30 SiO2:5
TPABr:1040 H2O:25 H2SO4 for Si/Fe ratio of 26, (2) 30 Na2O:0.19
Fe2O3:30 SiO2:5 TPABr:1040 H2O:25 H2SO4 for Si/Fe ratio of 48.
Iron (III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)35H2O, reagent grade, Acros Organics)
and sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO39H2O, reagent grade, SigmaAl-
drich) were used for iron and silicon sources. The reactant solution
was prepared in two containers. Iron sulfate (0.46 g for Si/Fe ratio
of 26 and 0.23 g for Si/Fe ratio of 48), 5.5 g of concentrated sulfuric
acid (H2SO4, 9598%, SigmaAldrich), and 25 g of DI water were
mixed in container 1. In a second container, 21.32 g of sodium
metasilicate was dissolved in 40.85 g of DI water. The solution in
the second container was then added slowly to the first container
while stirring. Next, 3.33 g of tetrapropylammonium bromide ((C3-
H7)4NBr, TPABr, 98%, SigmaAldrich) was added to the mixture un-
til a uniform solution was obtained. The pale yellow final mixture
was heated to a temperature of 443 K for 3 days under rotation in a
Teflon-lined Parr autoclave. The zeolite samples were recovered by
vacuum filtration, washed with DI water, and dried at room tem-
perature for 24 h. The samples were calcined in a horizontal quartz
flow reactor (ID = 20 mm) with air (grade 0.1, Matheson) flow by
increasing the temperature to 753 K at a rate of 2 K min1, and
maintaining the final temperature for 4 h.
[Fe]beta zeolite: [Fe]beta zeolite was synthesized using a proce-
dure reported by Raj and Sivasanker [23]. The gel composition was
2.3 (Na + K)2O:40 SiO2:0.5 Fe2O3:1 (TEA)2O:800 H2O. Specifically,
0.62 g of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Fisher Scientific), 0.46 g of
potassium
hydroxide
(KOH,
Fisher
Scientific),
and
74 g
of
tetraethylammonium
hydroxide
((C2H5)4NOH,
TEAOH,
40 wt%
solution, SigmaAldrich) were mixed, and the resulting solution
was added to 24 g of fumed silica (CAB-O-SIL M-5, Cabot). The mix-
ture was stirred until an optically clear solution was obtained. The
silica solution was slowly added to a solution containing 2.45 g of
iron sulfate dissolved in 40 g of DI water. The final solution was
transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated in a convec-
tion oven at 413 K for 15 days. The sample was collected, washed,
and dried in the same way as the [Fe]ZSM-5 samples. The sample
was calcined in a horizontal quartz flow reactor (ID = 20 mm).
The temperature was first increased with a ramp of 2 K min1 up
to 753 K under N2 (ultra high purity grade, Matheson) flow. When
the temperature reached 753 K, the N2 flow was changed to an air
flow, and the final temperature was kept for 8 h with the air flow.
[Al]ZSM-5: An aluminosilicate zeolite ([Al]ZSM-5) sample with
Si/Al ratio of 26 was synthesized with gel composition 16
Na2O:1.9 Al2O3:100 SiO2:3000 H2O using a procedure reported by
Kim et al. [21,24] Colloidal silica (Ludox AS-40, 40 wt% suspension,
SigmaAldrich) and sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, EM Science) were
used as the silica and alumina sources. First, 11.13 g of colloidal sil-
ica was dissolved with 2.9 g of a 5 M NaOH solution and 19.88 g of
DI water. Concurrently, 0.22 g of sodium aluminate was mixed
with 1.46 g of 5 M NaOH solution and 10 g of DI water in a different
container. After mixing for 1 h separately, the solutions were com-
bined. After one additional hour of continuous stirring, the final
solution was loaded into a Teflon-lined Parr autoclave and heated
in a convection oven at 463 K for 40 h under rotation. The product
was vacuum-filtered, washed with DI water, and dried in air.
[Si]ZSM-5 (silicalite-1): All silica zeolite ([Si]ZSM-5 or silicalite-
1) samples were prepared using the molar composition, 40 SiO2:9
TPAOH:1500 H2O [25]. A solution of 13.2 g of 1 M tetrapropylam-
monium hydroxide (TPAOH, aqueous solution, Alfa Aesar) and
28.34 g of DI water was stirred for 0.5 h. Then, 12 g of tetraethyl
orthosilicate (SiC8H20O4, TEOS, 98%, SigmaAldrich) was added to
the solution and stirred until the solution appeared transparent.
The final solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave
and heated at 383 K for 3 days in a convection oven. The zeolite
was separated from the solution by vacuum filtration, washing,
and drying. The sample was calcined in a furnace under an air
atmosphere by increasing the temperature up to 823 K with a
ramp of 2 K min1, holding this temperature for 10 h. In addition,
a chemical vapor deposition method (by subliming FeCl3) was used
to obtain iron clusters and/or iron oxide particles incorporated in
the structure of the [Si]ZSM-5 samples [26,27].
For the ion exchange with NH4 cations, 1 g of the sample was
mixed with 500 ml of aqueous solutions of NH4NO3 (0.1 M) and
stirred at room temperature overnight. The samples were then
filtered and washed with DI water three times. For sodium
exchange, the protocol was the same except that 0.1 g of the zeo-
lite (recovered from the reactor) was used for the ion exchange.
2.2. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a
Phillips XPert X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Ka radiation. The
samples were mixed with silicon standard (1020 wt%) to correct
the peak positions, and the UnitCellWin program was used to calcu-
late unit cell volumes of the samples from the corrected XRD data as
reported by Holland [28,29]. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
was obtained on JEOL JSM 7400F scanning electron microscope
(SEM) to measure the elemental composition of the zeolites. The
elemental composition was also measured with inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis (Galbraith
Laboratories, TN). The micropore volumes of samples were deter-
mined from N2 adsorption isotherms measured using a Micromeri-
tics ASAP 2020 instrument. Before adsorption of N2, the samples
264

were degassed at 623 K for 1 day using an in-house-built silica tube.
UV/Vis spectra of the samples were collected by using UV/Vis spec-
troscopy (Jasco V-550) with a diffuse reflectance cell. Reflectance
measurements converted to the KubelkaMunk function:
FR  1  R2=2R  K=S
1
where R is the ratio of the diffuse reflectance of the sample to that of
a reference material (BaSO4, SigmaAldrich), K is the absorption
coefficient, and S is the scattering coefficient.
2.3. Measurement of catalytic rates
About 70 mg of zeolite was transferred to a quartz tube reactor
(ID = 5 mm). To support the sample in the center of the reactor,
quartz wool was placed near the bottom of the reactor tube and
quartz chips were located between quartz wool and the sample.
The reactor was heated in a cylindrical furnace (C5232, Hoskins
Mfg. Co.). A temperature controller (NC 74000, Omega Engineering)
and a thermocouple (type K, Omega Engineering) inserted in the
quartz tube reactor were used to control temperatures of the reac-
tor. The samples were first heated at 473 K for 2 h to remove water
and then heated at 753 K for 3 h to obtain H-form samples under N2
(ultra high purity grade, Matheson) flow of 100 sccm. The reaction
temperature varied from 733 K to 803 K. The total flow rate of the
reactant gas, containing 5 mol% of propane (research grade, Mathe-
son) diluted in N2, was 80 sccm in all experiments. The reactor
effluent was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu
2014). A molsieve column was used for separation and eluted into
a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2 and N2 quantification
and a RT-alumina column was connected to a flame ionization
detector (FID) for hydrocarbons.
For the propane reaction at higher reaction conversions, the
amount of sample was increased to 120 mg and the total flow rate
decreased to 1.1 sccm, containing about 16% of propane. The prod-
uct distributions were analyzed using GC at reaction temperatures
of 773 K and 803 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Iron atoms in as-made, calcined, steamed samples
Si/Fe ratios of the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 were determined to be 26 and
48 (H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48)) and Si/Fe ratio of H-
[Fe]beta was 15 (H-[Fe]beta (15)) by ICP-AES analysis (Galbraith
Laboratory, TN) and EDX spectroscopy. All the [Al], [Fe], and [Si]
zeolite samples were highly crystalline based on XRD patterns,
the XRD patterns showed excellent agreement with the structure
types of MFI and BEA (Supporting Information, Fig. S1). Table 1
displays the micropore volumes of the [Fe] zeolites and reveals
that all the samples have micropore volumes within the ranges
typically observed for these samples.
The UV/Vis spectra and the unit cell volumes of [Fe]ZSM-5 (26)
were compared between as-made, calcined, and steamed forms of
the samples to confirm the presence of Fe sites in the framework
after calcination at 753 K. UV/Vis spectroscopy was used to help
determine the location of iron atoms (in or out of the framework).
Fig. 1(a) shows the UV/Vis spectra of the as-made zeolite samples
([Fe]ZSM-5, [Fe]beta, [Al]ZSM-5, and [Si]ZSM-5). Four ligand field
bands at 372, 410, 436, and 479 nm were observed for all
[Fe]ZSM-5 samples, while no bands were detected for [Al]ZSM-5
and [Si]ZSM-5. [Fe]beta zeolite also showed ligand field bands at
374, 414, 440, and 481 nm. The four bands are attributed to the
dd transition of Fe3+ in tetrahedral coordination. The transitions
at 372, 410, 436, and 479 nm for [Fe]ZSM-5 (at 374, 414, 440,
and
481 nm
for
[Fe]beta)
correspond
to
6A16S ! 4E4D,
6A16S ! 4T24D,
6A16S ! 4A14E4G,
and
6A16S ! 4T24G,
respectively [3033]. The spectral features confirm the presence
of Fe3+ in the framework of zeolite, as has been reported previously
[3034]. An intense band was also observed at 220 nm (Fig. 1(b)),
which is attributed to a pd charge transfer transition involving
the framework oxygen anions and the iron cations in [Fe] zeolite
[32,33]. The unit cell volumes were determined based on the
XRD patterns of the samples (Table 2) [28,29]. The unit cell volume
of the as-made [Fe]ZSM-5 (26) was 5405 Å3, larger than those of
the [Al]ZSM-5 (26) and [Si]ZSM-5 samples by reason of the larger
size of tetrahedral Fe3+ cation (63 pm in radius) compared with tet-
rahedral Al3+ (53 pm) and tetrahedral Si4+ (40 pm) cations [35,36].
A calcination process at 753 K was used for removal of the
structure directing agent (SDA). The color of the sample changed
from white to light yellow after the calcination step. The band at
220 nm in the spectrum of the calcined sample had almost the
same intensity and position as those of as-made sample, but the
spectrum showed a shoulder around 300 nm which is attributed
to isolated octahedral Fe3+ complexes [33,37]. The spectrum of
the calcined sample still showed the four ligand field bands in
the range of 350550 nm even though the bands were overlapped
with the shoulder around 300 nm (Fig. 1(b)). The calcined [Fe]ZSM-
5 had a larger unit cell volume (5412 Å3) than as-made [Fe]ZSM-5
(5405 Å3) because the structure directing agent (SDA) in the zeolite

pores was decomposed. These results indicated that most of the Fe
atoms remained in the framework structure after calcination while
part of Fe migrated from framework to extra-framework positions.
Iron atoms can migrate from framework to extra-framework in
Fe-containing zeolites during steaming process above a tempera-
ture of 873 K [13,3844]. Here [Fe]ZSM-5 and [Fe]beta zeolite sam-
ples were steamed by heating the samples at 973 K under air flow
containing about 10% water. The color of the sample became of
brownish color after steaming at 973 K. In the UV/Vis spectrum
of steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 (26), there was a broad absorption below
700 nm. The bands in the range of 350550 nm were no longer ob-
served. The intensity of the band at 220 nm was lower and the po-
sition of maximum absorption was shifted to a longer wavelength.
The change in the position of this peak is caused by the migration
of Fe atoms from framework to extra-framework positions in the
zeolites [12,33,34]. The reduced and shifted (from 220 nm) peak
indicates that the concentration of tetrahedral Fe3+ decreased after
steaming and Fe species were formed in extra-framework posi-
tions. The aggregation degree of a transition metal oxide particle
can be correlated to the absorption-edge energy as determined
by the UV/Vis spectra [45,46]. The absorption-edge energy was cal-
culated from the position of the low energy rise in the graph of
[F(R1)hm]2 vs. hm (Supporting Information, Fig. S2). The absorp-
tion-edge energies for as-made [Fe]ZSM-5 (26), calcined [Fe]ZSM-
5 (26), and steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 were determined as 4.53 eV,
4.45 eV, and 2.70 eV, respectively. The band gap energy of bulk
hematite (Fe2O3) is 2.0 eV [47]. The results suggest that aggrega-
tion of iron oxide occurs during the steaming process because
the degree of aggregation increases with a reduction in the absorp-
tion-edge energy [45]. As shown in Table 2, the reduction in unit
cell volume of the steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 (5350 Å3) indicated the re-
moval of framework iron and the formation of extra-framework
Fe species. It has been reported that when a sample is heated to re-
move the organic SDA, the unit cell volume increases at first and
then starts to decrease with increasing temperature [4850]. This
result is consistent with the changes in unit cell volumes that were
observed after calcination and after steaming. We conclude that
large fraction of the tetrahedral framework Fe3+ ions remain in
the framework after calcination while a majority of the Fe3+ ions
migrate from the framework after steaming.
3.2. Propane conversion on Fe sites in the framework
[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) samples were used to investigate the role of
framework and extra-framework Fe in the propane reaction.
Highly reactive and quickly deactivating sites were initially ob-
served for propane conversion over [Fe]ZSM-5 (26) (see Fig. 2).
The highly active sites were attributed to Lewis acid sites that
could be extraframework species, as reported by Narbeshuber
et al. [17,51] In particular, isolated octahedral Fe3+ species gener-
ated after calcination could be these sites. After the initial deactiva-
tion period, the samples then showed catalytic activity for the
propane conversion at a steady rate. The reaction rates and product
distribution reported here were collected after this initial deactiva-
tion period.
The kinetic analysis was carried out using the following
relationships:
r  k3
K1PC3H8
1  K1PC3H8  K00
4PC3H6  K0
4PC2H4
2
r  k3K1PC3H8  kappPC3H8

Under conditions at which the zeolite surface is mostly empty, such
as low reactant partial pressure, low conversion, and high reaction
temperature, the rate expression can be simplified to a first-order
rate equation (Eq. (3)). Conversions under 2% indicate that the reac-
tions were performed under differential conditions, which is con-
firmed by the stoichiometric ratio of methane to ethylene for
cracking channel and of hydrogen to propylene for dehydrogenation
channel. The apparent activation energy was obtained using Arrhe-
nius plots.
As shown in Table 3, the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) sample had very
high relative rates of dehydrogenation vs. cracking (rdehydrogenation/
rcracking  22), while the H-[Al]ZSM-5 (26) sample had higher rates
of cracking (rdehydrogenation/rcracking  0.36). The apparent activation
energy
for
dehydrogenation
over
H-[Fe]ZSM-5
(26)
was
115 kJ mol1 and was 173 kJ mol1 over H-[Al]ZSM-5 (26). A previ-
ous report also showed enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity and
lower apparent activation energies for thermally dehydroxylated
H-[Al]ZSM-5 compared to H-[Al]ZSM-5 [20]. The higher dehydro-
genation rates and lower apparent activation energy are inter-
preted as indicating that a different reaction mechanism for
hydrocarbon conversion is operative in these samples. Sodium-ex-
changed [Fe]ZSM-5 (26) showed slow (but measurable) reaction
rates (1020%) compared to the rates observed over H-[Fe]ZSM-5
(26). This difference in reactivity indicates that the acid proton in
H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) facilitates the electron transfer reaction. The
ability of H-[Al] zeolites to extract electrons from adsorbed species
has been observed numerous times [5257] while, on the other
hand, Na-exchanged zeolites show little (if any) electron transfer
for the same species [20,21,52]. It is expected that the same
trend will be observed for H-[Fe] zeolites vs. Na-[Fe] zeolites. This
should not be confused for Bronsted acid (protolytic) catalysis,
which is inconsistent with the patterns of selectivity and apparent
activation energies measured in the iron samples.

The catalytic reactions of propane were measured for the acid
form
of
[Fe]
zeolites
with
Si/Fe
ratios
of
15,
26,
and
48
(H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26), H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48), H-[Fe]beta (15)) and an
Arrhenius plot was used to compare the reaction rates over the
various iron-silicate zeolites (Fig. 3). The iron-silicate zeolites with
higher iron concentration had higher reaction rates for propane
dehydrogenation. H-[Fe]beta (15) had the highest reaction rates,
and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48) had the lowest reaction rates. The measured
activation energies were the same, within the experimental error,
for all samples. Table 4 shows the turnover frequencies (TOF)
and activation energies over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26), H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (48),
and H-[Fe]beta (15). The TOF is nearly identical for all samples.
This observation implies that (i) the propane conversion mainly
proceeds on isolated Fe sites in the framework, and (ii) the pore
size is not an important factor in the propane reaction given that
[Fe]beta zeolite (pore size of 6.7 Å) has a larger pore dimension
than [Fe]ZSM-5 (5.5 Å).
3.3. Propane conversion on extra-framework Fe species
Steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 samples were also examined for the pro-
pane conversion to understand the catalytic behavior of extra-
framework Fe. The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 sample showed 2 to 3 times
higher reaction rates (0.28 mol s1 g cat1  107 at 773 K) than Na-
[Fe]ZSM-5 (0.11 mol s1 g cat1  107 at 773 K), but showed only
about 1/4 of the rate for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (1.16 mol s1 g cat1  107
at 773 K). The apparent activation energy was 98 kJ mol1, lower
than that of H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (115 kJ mol1). The reaction rates and
the measured activation energies indicated that the extra-frame-
work Fe species are catalytically active although the mechanism
is unknown. Sodium-exchanged steamed sample had similar reac-
tion rates and activation energy than those of the steamed
[Fe]ZSM-5. Because the sodium-exchanged steamed sample did
not show any differences when compared with the steamed sam-
ple, the steamed sample has very few Fe atoms in the framework,
and all activity of the sodium-exchanged steamed sample and the
steamed sample comes from the extra-framework structures.
[Si]ZSM-5 and FeCl3 sublimated onto [Si]ZSM-5 did not exhibit
any detectable reaction (data not shown).
It is concluded that H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has multiple active sites, con-
sisting of Fe sites isolated in the framework and Fe species in extra-
framework positions (both in and outside the zeolite pores). All
sites showed very high dehydrogenation selectivity compared to
H-[Al] zeolites, irrespective of whether the Fe atoms were in or
out of the framework. However the catalytic activity over the Fe
sites in the framework was higher than that over the extra-frame-
work Fe sites.
3.4. Migration of Fe atoms during propane reaction
After conversion of propane, the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 sample was col-
lected and exchanged with sodium to investigate the migration
of Fe atoms during reaction. The Na-[Fe]ZSM-5* (after reaction)
sample had higher reaction rates than Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 (before reac-
tion), as shown in Table 3. The reaction rates were lower than those
of the Na-steamed [Fe]ZSM-5. These results indicate that a portion
of the Fe atoms in the framework migrated to extra-framework
positions during the reaction. The unit cell volume of [Fe]ZSM-5
after reaction is consistent with this explanation because the de-
creased values were still higher than the unit cell volume of
steamed [Fe]ZSM-5. On the basis of the unit cell volume, we can
estimate that about 50% of the Fe atoms migrated to extra-frame-
work positions during reaction. Correspondingly, the reaction rates
of Na-[Fe]ZSM-5* (after reaction) were about 50% of the reaction
rates of Na-steamed [Fe]ZSM-5. The high-temperature reaction
condition may have lead to the migration of Fe atoms during the

reaction, a result that could be related to the initially highly reac-
tive and quickly deactivating sites.
The reaction rates over sodium-exchanged samples (both Na-
[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) samples before and after reaction, and Na-steamed
[Fe]ZSM-5) were normalized to the number of extra-framework Fe
species. The normalized number of extra-framework Fe species
was calculated by subtracting the unit cell volume of Na-
[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) sample before reaction from the unit cell volumes
of three samples (Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) samples before and after
reaction, and steamed [Fe]ZSM-5). Fig. 4 shows that the reaction
rates were proportional to the normalized number of extra-frame-
work Fe species. The fraction of the reaction rate associated with
the extra-framework sites can be estimated from this relationship.
3.5. Catalytic properties at higher conversions
The reaction conversion over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 was increased to 3.6%
and 7.2% at reaction temperatures of 773 K and 803 K, respectively.
At these reaction temperatures, the conversion over H-[Al]ZSM-5
(26) was 7.2% and 18.7%. The selectivity over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) is
compared with that over chromia catalysts in Table 5, since chromia
catalysts are frequently used for the dehydrogenation of propane in
industrial processes [5860]. H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) showed about 85%
and 78% selectivity toward propylene at the reaction temperatures
of 773 and 803 K, while H-[Al]ZSM-5 (26) showed selectivity of
about 20% at both temperatures. H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) still showed high
dehydrogenation selectivity when the reaction conversions were in-
creased, and the selectivity values are comparable to the selectivity
shown by chromia catalysts [61,62]. In general, conversion over
[Fe]ZSM-5 (26) was lower than those over H-[Al]ZSM-5 and the
chromia catalysts under the conditions used here. Because the Fe
atoms migrate from framework to extra-framework positions dur-
ing the reaction, investigations of the reactivation of the catalysts
are necessary before considering the use of [Fe] zeolites for
dehydrogenation.
3.6. Reaction mechanism
The high dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-
cracking
ratio
22)
and
low
apparent
activation
energy
(115 kJ mol1) for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are very different from those of
H-[Al]ZSM-5 (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36 and activa-
tion energies 170180 kJ mol1). It is then unlikely that the cata-
lytic processes observed for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 proceed through a
protolytic mechanism as is the case in H-[Al]ZSM-5. First, since
the iron acid sites are only slightly less acidic than the aluminum
sites, the activation energy should be similar or higher than the
activation energy for Al acid sites and this is not the case. Second,
if the mechanism is protolytic, after the transfer of the proton from
the zeolite wall to the propane, the formed carbonium ion in Fe-
zeolites is, to a first approximation, similar to the carbonium ion
formed in Al-zeolites and although differences in selectivity are ex-
pected, they should be qualitatively similar, especially considering
the high temperatures at which the experiments are conducted.
For these reasons, it is reasonable to suspect that the operating
reaction mechanism on H-[Fe] zeolites is different from that on H-
[Al] zeolites. There have been many studies about catalytic active
sites on Fe-containing zeolites [34,3843,6373]. However, the
Fe-containing zeolites in most studies were prepared by ion ex-
change, chemical vapor deposition sublimation, or steaming after
hydrothermal synthesis, and thus, the samples had mostly extra-
framework Fe sites. Although the active sites in these Fe-containing
zeolite samples remain a subject for debate, it is generally accepted
that reactions over Fe-containing zeolites are catalyzed by the ex-
tra-framework Fe species; clustered iron species, iron oxides, and
Fe2+ sites reduced from Fe3+ [34,3843,6373]. We have shown here
that these species are active for propane conversion, but that they
are not responsible for most of the observed reactivity.
It is possible to construct a catalytic reaction mechanism for H-
[Fe]ZSM-5 based on a redox process. For example, early on McVick-
er et al. reported that hydrocarbon reactions can in fact proceed
through radical intermediates over solid acid catalysts [74]. Gener-
ation of radical cations, which were suggested as major reaction
intermediates, has been observed in the methanol-to-olefin con-
version over zeolites [75,76]. The radical-like route for hydrocar-
bon conversion is related to the oxidizing ability of the solid acid
catalysts. It has been shown in many cases that this oxidizing abil-
ity leads to a spontaneous ionization of molecules with low ioniza-
tion potential upon sorption in the pores of acid zeolites. The
spontaneous formation of radical cations of 2,5-dimethylhexa-
2,4-diene, trans-stilbene, and anthracene upon adsorption on H-
zeolites has been reported [5357].
Naphthalene was used here as probe to verify the presence of
redox chemistry in H-[Fe]ZSM-5. The experimental detail is avail-
able in other reports [20,21]. It has been shown that [Al]ZSM-5
after dehydroxylation has the ability to extract (oxidize) a single
electron from neutral naphthalene to form naphthalene radical
cations [20,21]. The post-dehydroxylated form of [Al]ZSM-5 also
showed enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-
to-cracking ratio 1) and a lower activation energy (127 kJ mol1).
Fig. 5 shows bands that can be assigned to naphthalene radical cat-
ions in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 while there are no such characteristic peaks in
H-[Al]ZSM-5. The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 did not generate the naph-
thalene radical cation either (data not shown) so extra-framework
iron species seem to be inactive toward electron abstraction from
naphthalene. This evidence for potential redox chemistry in
H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is an important clue to the nature of the active sites.

unit cell volume determinations.

The reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 is suggested for
the propane reaction over framework Fe sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and
H-[Fe]beta. An electron is extracted from the propane molecule at
the framework Fe site when the propane contacts the sites, and a
propane radical cation is formed. The propane radical cation is
unstable and dissociates into the more stable propene radical
cation [7779] and molecular hydrogen. Because Na-[Fe]ZSM-5
show lower reaction rates than H-[Fe]ZSM-5, electron capture is
presumed to be related to the acid sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5. The
reaction cycle is completed after the electron is given back to the
propene radical cation reforming the initial sites in H-[Fe]ZSM-5.
This reaction mechanism is similar to that introduced for a
thermally dehydroxylated catalyst in a previous report [20].
4. Conclusions
The catalytic properties of framework iron-containing zeolites
were investigated using the monomolecular propane reaction. It
was shown that the reaction proceeds with very high dehydroge-
nation selectivity and occurs via isolate framework Fe sites. The
measured TOFs per framework iron atom were the same for the
samples with different Si/Fe ratios (15, 26, and 48). Because there
is an 8090% decrease in reaction rates over the sodium-exchanged
samples, it is concluded that framework Fe sites were the sites
responsible for catalysis. The steamed [Fe]ZSM-5 also showed low-
er reaction rates than those for H-[Fe]ZSM-5, indicating that the Fe
sites isolated in the framework are the main channel for propane
conversion on H-[Fe] zeolites. In other words, the monomolecular
propane reaction is catalyzed on the Fe sites primarily in the
framework and to a lesser extent outside the framework. Active
sites in both framework and extra-framework positions showed
very high dehydrogenation selectivity and low activation energies
compared with those for H-[Al]ZSM-5. These results indicate that a
reaction mechanism different from proton donation from the acid
site, that is, a redox reaction mechanism, could explain the ob-
served properties of H-[Fe] zeolites. The spontaneous formation
of naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption on H-[Fe] zeolites
at room temperature supports the notion that H-[Fe]-zeolites have
redox properties that can lead to catalytic reactivity.
