Dehydrogenation of Isobutane over Zinc Titanate Thin Film Catalysts
Abstract
Thin films (80100 nm) of zinc titanate with Zn/Ti ratios between 0.5 and 2.7 were prepared on 2Si(100) wafers via the metallo-organic decomposition (MOD) technique. Their morphology, composition, and structure were extensively characterized by high resolution scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and glancing incidence XRD (GIXRD). The catalytic performance of these zinc titanate thin films in isobutane dehydrogenation was studied in a newly designed and built wafer reactor in the pulse mode. The zinc titanate films prepared via MOD consisted of irregularly shaped grains. The Zn/Ti ratio of the film surface as measured with XPS was slightly higher than that of the bulk, indicating some zinc enrichment on the surface. However, the overall composition through the film was reasonably homogeneous as revealed by a SIMS depth profiling study. GIXRD showed the existence of the same zinc titanate phases at all film depths, again indicating a homogeneous film. The zinc titanate phases found in the films depend primarily on the film stoichiometry. For films with a Zn/Ti ratio lower than 1, the phases found were zinc metatitanate (ZnTiO3) with a hexagonal structure and titanium dioxide. In the films with a higher Zn/Ti ratio, the zinc titanate phase was ZnTiO3or Zn2TiO4, both possessing a cubic structure. Catalytic testing of these films in isobutane dehydrogenation showed a clear correlation between the structure and the catalytic performance. Zinc titanate phases with a cubic crystal structure were active for dehydrogenation, but the other phases were not. The most active catalyst has a Zn/Ti ratio close to 2, the stoichiometry of which corresponds to the Zn2TiO4phase. The highest selectivity to isobutene was ca. 90 mol%, both at 823 and 923 K. The isobutane conversion was 2 and 8 mol%, respectively, at these two temperatures. Compared with the catalytic performance of a zinc titanate pellet pressed from powder material, the thin film catalyst exhibited a higher activity and a remarkably better stability.

How do various carbon-based materials, including coke deposits, carbon nanofibers, and hybrid nanocarbons, exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, and what are the proposed mechanisms, influencing factors (such as temperature and surface chemistry), and implications of this phenomenon for the development of novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
