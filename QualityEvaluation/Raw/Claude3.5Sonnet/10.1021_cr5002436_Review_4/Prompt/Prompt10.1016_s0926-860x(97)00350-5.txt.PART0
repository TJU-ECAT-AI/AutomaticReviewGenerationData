Abstract
Dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene was successufully carried out on iron loaded activated carbon catalyst at 873 K.
Isobutane conversion of 48%, the yield of 40% and selctivity 80% were obtained with 0.3 mmol iron loaded on 1 g of
activated carbon, at 873 K with W/F of 25 g-cat-h/mol of isobutane. Cofeeding of carbon dioxide promoted dehydrogenation
as compared to feeding bulk isobutane or isobutane and argon mixture. Hydrogen produced by dehydrogenation was
transformed into water in the presence of carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide was reduced to carbon monoxide. A redox cycle
of Fe3O4 and metallic iron is suggested for the catalytic cycle in carbon dioxide by analyzing XRD and XPS. Carbon
deposition was reduced under a carbon dioxide stream as compared with the reaction under argon atmosphere. # 1998

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increas-
ing importance because of growing demand for
alkenes. Isobutene has particularly high demand as
a feedstock for the production of oxygenated com-
pounds such as methyl t-butyl ether, as an additive to
reformulated gasoline.
Isobutene is typically produced industrially as a by-
product of steam cracking of naphtha or a uidized
catalytic cracking. Dehydrogenation of isobutane has
been reported to be an endothermic reaction Eq. (1)
over a Cr2O3Al2O3 catalyst near 850 K using ui-
dized bed reactor [1](a), (b).

In this process, carbon deposition leads to catalyst
deactivation; consequently, periodic catalyst regenera-
tion with air is required. This is successfully carried
out by circulating the catalyst between a reactor and a
regenerator both operated in uidized bed, and the
heat required for the dehydrogenation reaction could
be transferred from the catalyst which is regenerated
by burning coke.
Several research groups are pursuing ways to
improve the isobutene yield, catalyst stability, and
process economics. Researchers at Phillips Petroleum

Shell International researchers have investigated the
regeneration of catalyst by a cross-ow moving bed
reactor to give 51% isobutene yield [5]. Conversion of
isobutane is restricted due to an equilibrium at a low
temperature. To overcome this equilibrium limitation,
Matsuda et al. have investigated the use of a palladium
membrane reactor [6] and Ioannides et al. proposed
use of a silica membrane reactor [7]. In these pro-
cesses, by removing hydrogen, increases in the iso-
butene yield and selectivity were observed, since the
hydroisomerization Eq. (4) and hydrogenolysis reac-
tion Eq. (5) can no longer occur, in addition to shifting
the equilibrium favored side.

De Rossi et al. have investigated effects of supports
(Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2) of chromia catalyst on the
dehydrogenation of propane. They found that Cr2O3
supported on ZrO2 afforded higher turnover frequen-
cies than that loaded on SiO2 or Al2O3 [8]. They
extended dehydrogenation of isobutane with Cr2O3
ZrO2 catalyst, and obtained 45% conversion with a
high selectivity of 95% at 823 K. However, they
observed a marked deactivation of the catalyst during
the reaction for 60 min. As an active site, mononuclear
Cr(III) species with two coordinative unsaturations
and adjacent O
2 of the support are reported to be
involved [9]. Sato et al. reported effect of an addition
of ZnO to PtAl2O3 catalyst, and increased activity
and selectivity with the addition of ZnO [10]. Cort-
right and Dumestic reported that PtSn loaded K form
of L-zeolite exhibited a high activity and a selectivity
to isobutene and resistant to deactivation at 673773 K
[11].
Takita et al. have investigated the addition of oxy-
gen to the feed using several pyrophosphate catalysts
[12]. They obtained 20% isobutane conversion and
5060% isobutene selectivity at 823 K.

Huff et al. investigated catalytic oxidative dehydro-
genation of isobutane over Pt-coated monoliths in a
very short contact time (5 ms), at 10231073 K [13].
Under the conditions, isobutene can be formed by
either oxidative dehydrogenation or thermal dehydro-
genation. However, selectivity to isobutene was as low
as 40%, due to the formation of propene and deep
oxidation to CO2 and CO. Cavani et al. reported use of
heteropolyoxoanions as a catalyst for the oxidative
dehydrogenation
of isobutane.
They found
that
K2P2W17FeO61 afforded considerable activity and
selectivity to isobutene at 700 K.
In a previous paper, we have reported the oxidative
dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with Fe3O4- loaded
activated carbon catalyst in the presence of carbon
dioxide [14]. Due to an apparent oxidation of ethyl-
benzene with carbon dioxide giving carbon monoxide
and water, selectivity to styrene would be increased, as
compared to the simple dehydrogenation. In this
reaction, carbon dioxide played a role of oxidant
via redox cycle of Fe3O4 and metallic iron.
We have tried to extend this system to the dehy-
drogenation of isobutane. This paper deals with the
dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with car-
bon dioxide over an activated carbon-supported iron
catalyst. Effects of reaction conditions on the conver-
sion of isobutane and the selectivity to isobutene will
be discussed.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All chemicals were purchased from commercial
sources, and were used without further purication.
Granular activated carbon (AC: Wako pure chemical
industries, 1030 mesh, 873 m2/g) was used as a
support.
Carbon-supported iron catalysts were prepared by
impregnating a carbon support with aqueous solutions
of iron nitrate. Carbon-supported iron catalysts co-
loaded with lithium were prepared by co-impregnation
of solution containing both iron nitrate and lithium
nitrate. After the metal salts impregnation by immer-
sing the support for 24 h in aqueous solutions, water
244

was evaporated in vacuo, and then the catalyst was
dried at 343 K under reduced pressure. Since iron
species loaded on activated carbon varies during the
reaction, it is difcult to denote an amount of iron
species on weight base. We denote loading level of
iron in the molar amount per gram of activated carbon.
2.2. Apparatus and procedure
The reaction was carried out in a conventional ow
type reactor made of a quartz tube (8.0300 mm)
operated at atmospheric pressure. A 200600 mg por-
tion of catalyst was placed in the center of the reactor
by using a quartz glass wool plug. The reaction was
carried out at 773973 K for 15 h. Before introdu-
cing isobutane, the catalyst was heat-treated under an
argon stream from room temperature to 973 K at a
heating rate of 100 K/min and was maintained at this
temperature for 10 min. Then the catalyst was oxi-
dized with carbon dioxide at 973 K for 10 min, and the
reactor was cooled to the desired reaction temperature
under a stream of carbon dioxide.
The relative amounts of isobutane and carbon diox-
ide were adjusted while maintaining a constant total
feed ow rate of 45 ml/min at room temperature. At
the efuent from the reactor, water was collected into
a trap containing butanol.
Analyses of the C2, C3 and C4 hydrocarbon gases
were carried out with a Shimadzu GC14BPF gas
chromatograph (FID detector) with a 3 mm3 m glass
column packed with Uni carbon A-400(80/100 mesh)
in nitrogen carrier. Analyses of CO, CO2 and CH4
were carried out with a Shimadzu GC8AIT gas chro-
matograph (TCD detector) with a 3 mm2.5 m stain-
less steel column packed with an activated carbon(30/
60 mesh) using helium as a carrier gas. Analysis of
hydrogen were carried out with a Shimadzu GC8AIT
gas chromatograph (TCD detector) with a 3 mm3 m
stainless steel column packed with an activated carbon
(30/60 mesh) with nitrogen carrier.
2.3. Characterization of catalysts
Iron species before and after the dehydrogenation
reaction were analyzed with powder X-ray diffraction
method using a Jeol JDX-35305 with Cu-Ka irradia-
tion. XPS was measured with a Jeol JPS9000MX
spectrometer.
The surface area of the catalyst was measured with a
BET method using N2 at 77 K with an automatic
Micromeritics Gemini model 2375. The amount of
water was determined by the Karl Fisher automatic
volumetric titration method using Hiranuma aqua-
counter AQV-5S.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of loading level of iron
Fig. 1 represents isobutane conversion, isobutene
yield and selectivity as a function of the loading level
of iron onto 1 g of the activated carbon. Isobutane
conversion was 14.3% with an activated carbon with-
out iron loading and it increased with the loading level
of iron and reached a maximum of 23.3% in the
loading
level
of
iron
0.3 mmol/g
of
carbon
(3.5 wt.% as Fe3O4). Isobutene yield of 9.9% with
the activated carbon alone increased to 19.2% with the
loading level of iron 0.3 mmol/g of carbon, and no
further increases in isobutane conversion and isobu-
tene yield were observed with increasing loading level
of iron from 0.31.5 mmol/g of carbon. Isobutene
selectivity was nearly 80% irrespective of the loading
level of iron from 0.14.5 mmol/g of carbon. These

results indicate that optimum loading level of iron is
about 0.3 mmol/g of carbon, and that the loading of
iron promoted the conversion of isobutane. This level
of isobutane conversion and isobutene yield is the
same order of magnitude as obtained with PtSn
catalyst reported by Sato et al. [10], although we have
employed much shorter contact time of 8 g-cat-h/mol
as compared to their 60 g-cat-h/mol.
Dehydrogenation activity of activated carbon or
vanadium, nickel, and copper-loaded activated carbon
was reported by Fujimoto in the dehydrogenation of
cyclohexane [15]. However, promotion of dehydro-
genation activity with iron oxides has not been
reported.
3.2. Effects of reaction temperature with iron loaded
activated carbon catalyst
Effects of reaction temperatures on the dehydro-
genation of isobutane with Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst were
examined. Isobutane conversion, isobutene yield and
selectivity as a function of reaction temperature are
shown in Fig. 2. With increasing the reaction tem-
perature, isobutane conversion increased monoto-
nously, and isobutene yield increased from 5.7% at
773 K to 30.6% at 923 K, whereas isobutene selectiv-
ity markedly decreased from 90.1% at 823 K to 41.7%
at 973 K. Further increases in the reaction temperature
resulted in increased isobutane conversion with larger
decreases in the isobutene selectivity. These results
indicate that at a higher temperature thermal decom-
position of isobutane did occur to form large amounts
of cracked hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane,
ethene, and propene.
Isobutane conversion, isobutane yield and selectiv-
ity are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of time on stream
at the reaction temperatures of 873 and 923 K with a
Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst. At both reaction temperatures,
isobutane conversion, isobutene yield decreased con-
siderably in the initial 2 h of the reaction and thereafter
moderately decreased. Isobutene selectivity decreased
gradually with the progress in the reaction. The same
phenomenon was observed with the catalyst loaded a
higher amount of iron (Fe 1.5 mmol/g). The surface
area of the catalyst decreased from 935650 m2/g after
the reaction for 5 h at 923 K. The decrease in the
surface area increased with increasing reaction tem-
perature. Such decreases in the surface area could be
attributed to the carbon deposition to the catalyst as
reported previously [14].
In order to understand a role of carbon dioxide in the
dehydrogenation of isobutane, isobutane conversion,
isobutene yield and selectivity in carbon dioxide are
compared with those in an argon atmosphere using
Fig. 2. Effect of reaction temperature in the dehydrogenation of
isobutane on the conversion, yield and selectivity. Conditions and
symbols are the same as shown in Fig. 1.

the same as shown in Fig. 1, open symbols reaction at 873 K, solid
symobols reaction at 923 K.

Fe(0.3)/AC catalyst. The results are shown in Fig. 4.
Isobutene selectivity in a carbon dioxide atmosphere
was the same as that in an argon atmosphere. The
isobutane conversion and the isobutene yield under
carbon dioxide were, however, higher than those in an
argon atmosphere. In both argon and carbon dioxide
atmosphere, isobutane conversion and isobutene yield
decreased with the progress of the reaction. These
results indicate that the reaction under carbon dioxide
is effective for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. As
described later, CO2 may keep iron species in a higher
oxidation state (Fe3O4). In argon atmosphere, Fe3O4
would be reduced to metallic iron or iron carbide,
which are less active species for dehydrogenation.
Carbon deposition on the catalyst during dehydro-
genation, must be considered from the reduction in the
surface area during the reaction, in both argon and
carbon dioxide atmosphere.
In order to remove carbon on iron species, a regen-
eration treatment of the catalyst after the dehydro-
genation reaction with carbon dioxide was attempted
at 973 K for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 5, isobutane con-
version and isobutene yield decreased after the reac-
tion for 3 h, from 23% and 20% to 15% and 13%
respectively. The reaction was interrupted, under an
argon stream the temperature was raised to 973 K, and
then CO2 was introduced to burn off carbon species
deposited on to the catalysts. After CO2 treatment at
973 K for 1 h, isobutane conversion and isobutene
yield increased 17% and 15% respectively, but the
original activity of the catalyst could not be restored.
The slight increase in the catalyst activity seems to be
due to removal of deposited carbon on the catalyst.
3.3. Effects of contact time
Fig. 6 shows the effect of contact time (W/F) on the
isobutane conversion, the isobutene yield and the
selectivity. In these experiments, W/F was changed
by varying the amount of catalyst charged under a
constant isobutane feed rate (37 mmol/h). With
increasing a W/F from 5.425 g-cat-h/mol, isobutane
conversion and isobutene yield increased monoto-
nously. Interestingly, isobutene selectivity slightly
increased with an increase in W/F from 5.4 to 13.8.
However, for further increase in the contact time, a
slight decrease in the selectivity was observed result-
ing in the decrease in the yield of isobutene. Increasing
contact time is effective for the dehydrogenation of
isobutane, since the dehydrogenation of isobutane
over this catalyst is a slow reaction at 873 K. A similar
tendency was reported by Sato et al. [10]. Our catalyst
exhibited slightly higher selectivity to isobutene as
compared to PtZnOAl2O3 catalyst [10].

3.4. Effects of the addition of lithium to iron-loaded
activated carbon catalyst
In the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene,
ironlithium
co-loaded activated carbon catalyst
exhibited the smaller deactivation during the pro-
longed run [14]. Activated carbon is well known to
behave as an acidic catalyst. Acidic site on the catalyst
is responsible for carbon deposition and cracking to
smaller molecules. In the previous results, a Fe to Li
molar ratio of 3 to 1 is known to be optimum for the
dehydrogenation. The same ratio of Fe to Li was
employed in this study. In the run at 873 K for 1 h,
isobutane conversion and isobutene yield did not
change as compared to the Fe- loaded catalyst. Effects
of reaction temperatures on the conversion, the yield,
and the selectivity were examined, but again no sig-
nicant differences between Fe and FeLi co-loaded
catalyst were observed.
Effect of lithium co-loading on the prolonged run
was examined and the results are compared to Fe/AC
catalyst as shown in Fig. 7. Isobutane conversion,
isobutene yield and selectivity with Fe(1.5)Li(0.5)/
AC catalyst exhibited the similar behavior to those of
Fe(1.5)/AC catalyst with time on stream. Isobutane
conversion and isobutene yield with Fe(1.5)Li(0.5)/
AC catalyst were slightly higher than those with
Fe(1.5)/AC catalyst after the reaction for 2 h.
The surface area of Fe(1.5)Li(0.5)/AC catalyst
slightly decreased from 692 to 658 m2/g after the
reaction for 5 h. The decrease in the surface area
was smaller than Fe/Ac catalyst. However, the promo-
tion effect of lithium on the catalyst deactivation is not
signicant as compared to the case of dehydrogena-
tion of ethylbenzene [14], where a much larger amount
of carbon deposition occurred, even the reaction at
823 K. This seems to be the smaller amount of carbon
deposition in the dehydrogenation of isobutane than as
compared to ethylbenzene. Such difference is partly
attributed to the differences in the stability in the
isobutene and styrene, where styrene tends to form
condensed compounds.
3.5. XRD analyses of the catalyst
Fig. 8(a) shows X-ray diffraction patterns of an
iron-loaded
activated
carbon
(Fe(1.5)/AC)
after
treatment with argon at 973 K for 20 min. Clear
diffraction peaks did not appear, probably due to a
lower loading level of iron compared to the high
surface area of the activated carbon, but the broad
diffraction peak at 2 of 43 degree could be assigned
to a-iron.

treatment, magnetite was formed on the carbon sur-
face.
When we employed an argon pre-treated catalyst in
the dehydrogenation reaction, a larger amount of
carbon deposition was observed, even in the reaction
under a carbon dioxide ow. After the dehydrogena-
tion reaction with isobutane under carbon dioxide, the
same XRD pattern was observed as shown in
Fig. 8(c). Sharp diffraction peaks appeared, and they
were assigned as Fe3O4 magnetite. This result indi-
cates that magnetite was formed from a-iron even at
873 K on the carbon surface during dehydrogenation
of isobutane.
The diffraction patterns of the iron catalyst pre-
treated in carbon dioxide, after the reaction for 5 h
with isobutane in carbon dioxide at 873 K, are shown
in Fig. 8(c). No changes in the diffraction peaks were
observed as compared to Fig. 8(b). Fig. 8(d) shows
the diffraction patterns of the iron catalyst after the
reaction for 5 h with isobutane in argon at 873 K. The
X-ray diffraction pattern is quite similar to that
observed for the fresh catalyst after treatment with
argon at 973 K for 20 min (Fig. 8(a), and few diffrac-
tion peaks assignable to magnetite were observed.
During the dehydrogenation reaction, magnetite was
reduced to iron metal.
XPS spectra supports formation of Fe3O4 species
(binding energy of 710 eV) in the iron catalyst used for
dehydrogenation under carbon dioxide. When argon
pre-treated catalyst was reacted under argon stream,
two peaks were observed at 706 and 708 eVin the XPS
of the catalyst used. The peak at 706 eV would be
assigned to a-iron and peak at 708 eV would be iron
carbide (Fe3C). Iron carbide was not detected in XRD.
These results clearly indicate that the role of carbon
dioxide in the dehydrogenation of isobutane to iso-
butene is to keep the magnetite phase in the catalytic
process.
In the reaction under carbon dioxide, almost the
same amounts of carbon monoxide and water corre-
sponding to the amount of isobutene were detected.
However, in argon atmosphere, hydrogen was pro-
duced, corresponding to the amount of isobutene
produced.
Two reaction paths for the formation of water in the
dehydrogenation of isobutane in a carbon dioxide
atmosphere could be proposed. The rst one is a direct
process that isobutane reduces iron oxide to iron metal
and carbon dioxide directly oxidize iron to magnetite.
Consequently, carbon dioxide promotes the dehydro-
genation reaction. Such possibility of a redox cycle
involving reduction of magnetite with isobutane and
oxidation of iron with carbon dioxide giving magne-
tite, is shown below:
i-C4H10  Fe3O4 ! i-C4H8  Fe  H2O
(8)
Fe  CO2 ! Fe3O4  CO
(9)
The second one is a simple catalyzed dehydrogena-
tion of isobutane to give isobutene and hydrogen,
followed by a reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)
giving water. This made it possible to reduce hydrogen
partial pressure and release thermodynamic limitation
of equillibrium. In other words, carbon dioxide is
utilized to remove hydrogen to give more favorable
conditions for the dehydrogenation.

The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in
carbon dioxide was smaller (1 mmol carbon/g of
catalyst for 5 h) than that in an argon (4 mmol car-
bon/g of catalyst for 5 h) at the same temperature
(873 K). This result indicates that the deposited car-
bon seems to be gasied with a carbon dioxide atmos-
phere, or carbon deposition on to Fe3O4 would be
suppressed.

The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst
pretreated in carbon dioxide was lower than that of
pretreated in argon. The amount of carbon deposited
on the catalyst increased with higher reaction tem-
perature.
4. Conclusion
Activated carbon-supported iron catalysts exhibited
a high isobutene yield in the presence of a carbon
dioxide. An addition of 0.10.3 mmol of iron sup-
ported on one gram of activated carbon resulted in
signicant increase in the catalytic activity.
X-ray diffraction analyses of activated carbon sup-
ported iron catalysts indicated that iron on the surface
of the carbon support was converted into magnetite
under pretreatment with a carbon dioxide at 973 K.
Since the magnetite phase disappeared in the reaction
of isobutane in an argon atmosphere, magnetite is
considered to be an active phase of the catalyst. In
the dehydrogenation of isobutane in carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide and water were formed. These
results indicate that isobutene is produced with both
simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of isobutane, through the redox cycle of Fe3O4
and Fe.
The catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogena-
tion was attributed to carbon deposition because the
surface area of the catalyst decreased after the reaction
and the weight of the catalyst bed increased after the
reaction.
