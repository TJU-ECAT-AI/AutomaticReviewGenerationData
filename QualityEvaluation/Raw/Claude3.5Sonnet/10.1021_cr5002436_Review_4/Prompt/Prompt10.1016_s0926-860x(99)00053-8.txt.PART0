Abstract
Phase-pure early transition metal nitrides and carbides were prepared via the temperature programmed reaction of metal
oxides with NH3 or a CH4/H2 mixture. The nitrides and carbides were mostly mesoporous with surface areas up to 81 m2/g.
Their gravimetric butane conversion rates were generally higher than those for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Activities for the
nitrides and carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/cm2 s at 723 K and decreased as follows: g-
Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92. The metal atom type had the most signicant
effect on the activity and selectivity. The Group VI metal nitrides and carbides were much more active than the Group V metal
compounds. In general, the Group VI metal compounds catalyzed butane hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation with similar
selectivities while the vanadium compounds had dehydrogenation selectivities in excess of 98%. The b-W2N catalyst also
catalyzed butane isomerization possibly as a consequence of the presence of oxygen on the surface. The effect of lattice structure
was signicant and obvious for the tungsten carbides where WC (hex) was almost twice as active as WC1x (fcc) despite having
similarC/Wratios.Nitrides and carbidesofthesamemetaland latticestructurehadsimilaractivitiessuggestingthattheeffectofthe

1. Introduction
Early transition metal nitrides and carbides (and
their oxy- counterparts) have received a great deal of
attention for use as catalysts for hydrodenitrogenation,
hydrodesulfurization, alkane isomerization and a vari-
ety of other hydrocarbon conversion reactions [16].
These materials can be produced in high surface area
form using temperature programmed reaction (TPR)
methods [79] and in some cases have higher activities
than the commercial catalysts [1,10]. Much of the
focus has been on Group VI transition metal nitrides
and carbides including g-Mo2N, b-Mo2C, WC and
WC1x. There are very few reports describing the
catalytic properties of Group V nitrides and carbides.
Chen [11,12] recently suggested that vanadium car-
bides should be active alkane activation catalysts
based on comparisons of the CH and C=C bond
activation reactivities of clean and carbide-modied

V(1 1 0) single crystals. The goal of work described in
this paper is to compare the catalytic properties of
Group V and VI transition metal nitride and carbide
powders. While the materials all had surface areas in
excess of 10 m2/g, we made no attempt to maximize or
vary their surface areas.
The nitrides and carbides were prepared via TPR of
the corresponding oxides with an NH3 or CH4/H2
mixture, characterized using X-ray diffraction and
sorption analysis, and evaluated for the conversion
of n-butane. The results allow assessments of the
effects of non-metal atom type (nitrogen or carbon),
metal atom type (molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium or
niobium) and lattice structure on the catalytic proper-
ties. We made signicant efforts to eliminate the
presence of residual oxygen and excess carbon, never-
theless, it is possible that the catalysts contained these
species. Their expected inuence will be discussed in
the context of the results. We compared catalytic
properties of the early transition metal nitrides and
carbides to those of a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The
catalytic properties of nitrides and carbides have been
reported to be similar to those of Pt-group metals for
several hydrocarbon conversion reactions [5,1316].
In some cases the similarities have been attributed to
resemblances between electronic properties of the
nitrides and carbides, and those of the Pt-group metals
[1719].
2. Methods
2.1. Synthesis
The materials were synthesized by reacting 15 g of
the
metal
oxide
(V2O5-99.95%,
Alfa;
Nb2O5-
99.9985%, Alfa; MoO3-99.95%, Alfa; WO3-99.8%,
Alfa) with a owing NH3 or CH4/H2 mixture. The
oxides were supported on a quartz wool plug in a
quartz synthesis reactor. Additional details concerning
the synthesis reactor are given elsewhere [20,21]. The
NH3 (99.998%, Scott) or CH4/H2 mixture (49.9%
CH4, Scott) ow rates were adjusted to yield mass
hourly space velocities up to 300 h1. The temperature
programs were developed based on the results of
thermal gravimetric analysis. In the case of the car-
bides, the thermal gravimetric analysis data allowed us
to prepare materials with minimal amounts of excess
carbon. General features of the temperature programs
are illustrated in Fig. 1. Prior to initiation of the
temperature program, the materials were ballistically
heated to the rst set point temperature (T1) in 0.5 h for
NbN, Mo2N and Mo2C, and in 1 h for NbC and W2N.
The WC1x catalyst was prepared by carburizing b-
W2N in the CH4/H2 mixture. The specic reaction
temperatures and heating rates used to synthesize the
nitrides and carbides are listed in Table 1. Most of the
materials were soaked at the nal temperature for up
to 1 h to ensure completion of the solid-state reactions.
After completion of the temperature program, the
reactor was removed from the furnace and quenched
to room temperature. To prevent pyrolysis on exposure
to air, the materials were passivated for 12 h using a
mixture of 1% O2 in He (Scott) owing at 20 cm3/min.
The passivation layer was subsequently removed by a
high temperature reduction step. The reduction con-
ditions were previously determined using temperature
programmed reduction methods [2123].
2.2. Characterization
The as-prepared materials were characterized using
X-ray diffraction and sorption analysis. A Rigaku
DMAX-B X-ray diffractometer (Cu K radiation;
1.5405 A
 ) was used to determine the crystalline struc-
tures. The average crystallite size was calculated using
the Scherrer equation [24]:

where K is a constant (taken here to be 0.9),  the
wavelength of the radiation, B the corrected peak
width and  the Bragg angle of the peak.
The BET surface areas were determined by N2
adsorption at 77 K using either a Micromeritics
ASAP 2010 or Quantasorb analyzer. The samples
were degassed in vacuo, owing He or owing H2
at 773 K for at least 3 h before analysis. The surface
areas were used to estimate the average particle sizes
using the following equation:
dp  6
Sg
;
where  is the bulk nitride or carbide density and Sg is
the surface area. Use of this equation assumes that the
particles were spherical and/or cubic. Pore size dis-
tributions were determined from the N2 desorption
isotherms using the Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda
cylindrical pore model [25].
2.3. Butane activation rates
The reaction rates were determined using a 6 mm
OD quartz U-Tube ow reactor. Between 40 and
100 mg of material was placed onto a quartz wool
plug, purged with He (99.999%, Air Products) then
reduced in owing H2 (99.99%, Air Products) for 3 h.
The Group VI nitrides and carbides were reduced
at 753 K and the Group V compounds were reduced
at 773 K. After reduction, the bed was cooled to
the reaction temperature, and the reactant mixture
consisting of 4% n-C4H10, 60% H2 and 36% He
was passed over the catalyst. The total reactant ow
rate was 50 ml/min and the total pressure was
101 kPa. The butane activation rate for a PtSn/
Al2O3 (0.3% Pt, 1.2% Sn and 1.8% Na) dehydrogena-
tion catalyst [26] was also evaluated. This material
was pretreated in H2 for 3 h at 753 K before initiating
the H2/C4H10 mixture ow. The reactor efuent was
analyzed using an on-line gas chromatography system
consisting of a 3.05 m n-octane/Porasil C packed
column and a HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph
with a ame ionization detector. Reaction rates
were determined at several temperatures between
648 and 723 K, and were reproducible to within
10%. The butane conversion was limited to 2% so
that the system could be treated as a differential
reactor. The butane conversions were also limited to
be substantially lower than the equilibrium conversion
for n-C4H10 over the temperature range explored
[27,28]. The product selectivity is expressed as the
fraction of butane that was consumed to form the
product.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst structure
X-ray diffraction patterns for the nitrides and car-
bides are presented in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The
peak positions are consistent with crystalline phases
listed in Table 2 and indicate that the materials were
phase-pure. There was no evidence of crystalline
oxide in any of the materials. Diffraction patterns
for the used catalysts (after butane activation) were
nearly identical to those for the fresh catalysts. Other

structural properties of the fresh nitrides and carbides
are given in Table 2. Note that three different tungsten
carbides were synthesized. Bulk carbon contents have
been measured for these materials; the C:W ratios
were 1.1, 0.9 and 0.5 for the WC, WC1x and W2C
catalysts, respectively [21].
Surface areas for the nitrides and carbides were
substantially higher than those for their parent oxides
(7 m2/g) and ranged up to 81 m2/g. For most of the
materials, the particle sizes estimated from the surface
areas were similar to the crystallite sizes estimated via
XRD line broadening analysis. This suggested that,
with the exception of the Mo2N, VN and VC catalysts,
the particles were single crystalline.
Pore size distributions for several of the nitrides and
carbides are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.
The presence of micropores distinguished the Group V
and VI metal nitrides and carbides. All of the Group
VI metal nitrides and carbides possessed some degree
of microporosity (dpore<2 nm) while the Group V
compounds did not contain micropores. The highest
density of pores for both the Group V and VI metal
nitrides and carbides was typically in the mesopore
range (250 nm). Pore size distributions for W2N,
WC1x and WC were bi- or tri-modal. There were
no other apparent correlations between the surface
areas or pore size distributions and the type of nitride
or carbide.

3.2. Catalytic properties
Reaction
rates
for
the
nitrides
and
carbides
decreased slightly during the rst few hours on stream,
then stabilized with no signicant additional deactiva-
tion. External mass transport was not limiting as the
reaction rates were found to be independent of the
reactant ow rate within experimental error. Arrhenius
plots of the steady-state reaction rates for the nitrides
and carbides are illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7, respec-
tively. The niobium nitride and carbide were inactive.
For comparison, reaction rates for the PtSn/Al2O3
catalyst are also plotted. We used the entire catalyst
mass (active phase, promoters and support) to normal-
ize the reaction rates because comparisons based only
on the active phase would be biased by the high
dispersions for Pt on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Dis-
persions for the bulk nitride and carbide catalysts were
very low (<0.1%) based on their total surface areas.
Except for the Group V metal compounds, reaction
rates for the nitrides and carbides were higher than
those for the PtSn catalyst over the entire range of
temperatures examined. The catalytic properties are
summarized in Table 3. The Group VI metal nitrides
and carbides catalyzed butane dehydrogenation, iso-
merization and hydrogenolysis while the Group V
metal compounds were selective for the dehydrogena-
tion of butane. Volumetric reaction rates for the
nitrides and carbides were as much as an order of
magnitude higher than those for the PtSn/Al2O3
catalyst. This enhancement is due primarily to the
high densities for the nitrides and carbides. A density

of 3.9 g/cm3 was assumed for the PtSn/Al2O3 cata-
lyst and the void fraction for all of the materials was
estimated to be 0.5. The implication of a higher
volumetric rate is that the associated catalytic reactor
would be smaller.
Reaction rates normalized using the surface areas
provide a useful metric for comparing intrinsic cata-
lytic properties of the nitrides and carbides. The Group
VI metal nitrides and carbides were substantially more
active than the Group V metal compounds. Further-
more, butane consumption activities for the nitrides
were generally within experimental error of those for
the carbides. This observation implies that the car-
bides did not contain signicant amounts of excess
carbon at the surface. Excess carbon deposition is a
common problem for carbides prepared via TPR
methods and often results in articially low reaction
rates [21,29].
Product distributions for the nitrides are illustrated
in Fig. 8 and those for the carbides are given in Fig. 9.
The product distribution for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst
is also plotted in these gures. At the low conversions
employed, the product distributions were not signi-
cantly inuenced by changing the temperature. In
general, the Group VI metal nitrides and carbides
had similar selectivities for n-butane hydrogenolysis
and dehydrogenation. The W2N catalyst was the
exception, producing a substantial amount of i-butane.
This high isomerization selectivity was not observed
for WC1x, the carbide analog of W2N. Product
distributions for the tungsten carbides were similar
despite their different lattice structures and C:W
ratios. The vanadium nitride and carbide catalysts
were highly selective for the dehydrogenation of
butane. Their product distributions were similar to
that for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Note that the butane
conversions for all of the catalysts were similar, there-
fore differences between the product distributions
were not due to different conversion levels.

4. Discussion
Butane conversion activities for the nitrides and
carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/
cm2 s at 723 K. The materials ranked as follows in
order of decreasing activity: Mo2N>W2CWC>
W2NWC1x>Mo2C>VNVCNbNNbC.
Site
density measurements have not been completed for
these materials, however, we can estimate their turn-
over frequencies by assuming an active site density.
Using a site density of 1015 atoms/cm2, turnover fre-
quencies for the nitrides and carbides ranged up to
102 s1. These turnover frequencies should be con-
sidered lower limits because the actual site densities
will be some fraction of 1015 atoms/cm2 [3,9,22,30].
The turnover frequency for the PtSn/Al2O3 was
previously determined to be 0.063 s1 at 723 K based
on O2 chemisorption [21]. This value probably under-
estimates the performance of Pt since Sn is known to
chemisorb oxygen [31]. For comparison, the turnover
frequency assuming a Pt dispersion of 50% would be
0.045 s1 at 723 K. Activities for the nitrides and
carbides are also on the same order of magnitude as
those reported for bulk Pt catalysts. Guczi et al. [32]
reported activities of 1.01012 and 3.21012 mole-
cules/cm2 s for butane hydrogenolysis and isomeriza-
tion, respectively, at 723 K over Pt powders.
Results presented in this paper were used to assess
the effects of non-metal atom type, metal atom type
and lattice structure on the catalytic properties of early
transition metal nitrides and carbides. Although the
XRD patterns indicated that the bulk materials were
phase pure, our assessment of effects of the non-metal
atom must be considered tentative because elemental
analysis was not performed. Like nitrogen and carbon,
oxygen can populate interstitial sites in nitrides and
carbides [3335]. The resulting oxynitride or oxycar-
bide would have a lattice structure very similar to that
of the corresponding nitride or carbide. The reader is
also cautioned that because XRD only samples the
crystalline structures, amorphous species may have
been present in or on the materials. Amorphous spe-
cies could introduce additional functionalities into the
nitride and carbide catalysts [3437]. For example,
Iglesia et al. [4] reported that oxygen treatment pro-
duced amorphous WOx sites on tungsten carbide
surfaces. The resulting materials were bifunctional
and capable of isomerizing alkanes. With the excep-
tion of the W2N catalyst, isomerization activities of
the nitrides and carbides were relatively small sug-
gesting that the contribution of surface oxides was
very small if any.
Nitrides and carbides of the same metal and lattice
structure had similar activities and apparent activation
energies. For example, VN and VC are face-centered
cubic with very similar lattice constants (4.129 and
4.166 A
 , respectively). The results suggest that the
bulk non-metal atom type did not signicantly inu-

ence the butane conversion activity. Given the similar
sizes and electronic properties of nitrogen and carbon,
similarities between the catalytic properties of nitrides
and carbides with identical structures are not unex-
pected. It is possible that surface structures and com-
positions for the nitrides and carbides were similar
under reaction conditions due to carburization of the
nitrides by butane in the reactant mixture. The carbur-
ized nitride would possess catalytic properties similar
to those of the native carbide. X-ray diffraction pat-
terns for the used nitrides were nearly identical to
those for the fresh materials indicating that if carbur-
ization occurred it was restricted to the surface. Future
investigations using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
and extended X-ray absorption ne structure analysis
should provide information concerning the nitride and
carbide surface compositions and structures. Assum-
ing that the effect of the non-metal atom type was
small, differences between the activities of Mo2N (fcc)
and Mo2C (hcp) can be attributed primarily to their
different structures. Alkane hydrogenolysis reactions
are known to be structure-sensitive over noble metal
catalysts [38] and could be structure-sensitive over the
nitrides and carbides.
An indication of the importance of lattice structure
and composition on properties of the nitrides and
carbides can be ascertained from a comparison of
the catalytic activities of WC, WC1x and W2C.
The WC catalyst was almost twice as active as the
WC1x catalyst. These materials have similar bulk
C:W ratios but WC is hexagonal and WC1x is face-
centered cubic. Lee et al. [39] reported that lattice
structure also had an effect on the catalytic properties
of Mo carbides. They found that Mo2C (hcp) was
more active than a-MoC1x (fcc) for the hydrogeno-
lysis of n-butane. Our recent studies of the adsorptive
and catalytic properties of molybdenum nitride thin
lms also demonstrated the importance of lattice
structure [40,41]. Geometries and energies for the
adsorption/desorption of H2, NH3 and CH3NH2 on
d-MoN (hexagonal) and B1-MoN (fcc) were very
different. Considering that the hexagonal tungsten
carbides, WC and W2C, had different activities and
activation energies, the non-metal atom content also
appeared to affect the catalytic activity, although
lattice parameters for these materials are different
(a2.9062 A
 , c2.8398 A
for WC; a2.9971 A
 ,
c4.7279 A
 for W2C).
Changing the metal atom type caused a signicant
change in the butane conversion activity. More impor-
tantly, we found that the metal atom type affected the
reaction selectivity. Effects of the metal atom type can
be illustrated by comparing Mo2N to W2N, Mo2C to
W2C or VN to NbN. For these couples, the lattice
structures were similar. The Mo2N catalyst which
catalyzed the dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis
of butane was more than twice as active as W2N
which primarily catalyzed the dehydrogenation and
isomerization of butane. Differences between the
activities and selectivities of Mo2N and W2N (or
Mo2C and W2C) may have been a consequence of
their different electronic structures. Their densities of
states at the Fermi level are very different [42],
although these materials would appear to be isoelec-
tronic and it has been suggested that the electronic
structures of carbides of different early transition
metals are similar [4345]. A factor contributing to
differences between electronic structures of the
nitrides and carbides is the different electronic struc-
tures of their parent metals. The electronic congura-
tions of Mo and W are [Kr]4d55s1 and [Xe]5d46s2,
respectively, and those of Vand Nb are [Ar]3d34s2 and
[Kr]4d45s1, respectively [46].
The effect of the metal atom type was particularly
dramatic in comparing Group V and VI transition
metal compounds. The VC and WC1x catalysts were
face-centered cubic with similar carbon:metal ratios,
however, these materials had very different activities
and selectivities. The vanadium carbide selectively
catalyzed the dehydrogenation of butane while the
tungsten carbide catalyzed butane hydrogenolysis and
dehydrogenation. Again we can argue that the dra-
matic differences between the VC and WC1x cata-
lysts were a consequence of their different electronic
structures. In addition to differences between their
parent metal electronic structures, the degree of charge
transfer between the metal and non-metal atom should
be very different for the Group V and VI compounds.
One indicator of the potential for charge transfer is the
difference in electronegativities. These differences
suggest that more electron density is transferred from
the Group V metal to the non-metal atom than is
transferred from the Group VI metal. Consequently,
the degree of ionicity in bonding between the metal
and non-metal atoms should be greater for the Group
V compounds.

An examination of the product selectivities pro-
vides insight into the mechanism for butane hydro-
genolysis. Detailed mechanisms will be the subject of
a future paper. We used three metrics to characterize
the hydrogenolysis mechanism. The average number
of CC bonds activated per butane molecule con-
verted, X, characterized the importance of multiple
hydrogenolysis and was determined from the follow-
ing equation:

where SCi is the selectivity to hydrocarbons with i
carbon atoms. Values for the Group VI nitrides and
carbides were higher than unity indicating some
degree of multiple hydrogenolysis (see Table 4).
Under the reaction conditions employed, the product
would not be expected to readsorb, therefore, the
results appear to be consistent with butane forming
multiple bonds with the nitride or carbide surface. The
degree of multiple hydrogenolysis for the PtSn/
Al2O3 catalyst was negligible based on the value
of X. The relative importance of terminal and central
CC bond hydrogenolysis can be assessed from the
following selectivity ratio:
R  Sc1  Sc3
2Sc2
:
For all except the Mo2C catalyst, this ratio was less
than unity suggesting that the central CC bond was
preferentially activated (see Table 4). Hydrogenolysis
over the Mo2C catalyst appeared to be randomly
distributed between the central and terminal CC
bonds while the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst favored hydro-
genolysis of the terminal CC bonds. Olen to parafn
ratios for all the materials except Mo2C were small
indicating a preference for the production of saturated
hydrocarbons
during
hydrogenolysis.
The
three
metrics suggest that except perhaps for the Mo2C
catalyst, hydrogenolysis mechanisms for the early
transition metal nitrides and carbides were similar.
The high isomerization selectivity for W2N (>40%)
was unique among the early transition metal nitrides
and carbides. We have tentatively concluded that this
catalyst contained amorphous oxide or oxynitride
domains at the surface in addition to the nitride sites.
The alkane isomerization activities of tungsten car-
bides have been attributed to the presence of two
complementary catalytic sites; tungsten carbide sites
where alkane dehydrogenation and olen hydrogena-
tion reactions are catalyzed and tungsten oxide sites
where olen isomerization is catalyzed [4]. These
bifunctional catalysts can be prepared by partially
oxidizing tungsten carbides [47].
Activation energies for the early transition metal
nitrides and carbides were similar to those reported for
other metal carbide and Pt-group metal catalysts.
Activation energies for nitrides and carbides that
catalyzed the hydrogenolysis of butane were between
22 and 28 kcal/mol. These values are typical of acti-
vation energies observed for n-alkane hydrogenolysis
over tungsten carbides. Ribeiro et al. [37] reported
apparent activation energies of 2223 kcal/mol for n-
hexane hydrogenolysis over WC and W2C catalysts,
albeit at lower temperatures than those used in our
experiments. Activation energies for butane hydroge-
nolysis over Pt powders and polycrystalline lms were
2126 kcal/mol for a temperature range very similar to
the one used in our study [32,48]. Activation energies
for other metals including other noble metals are
different from those reported for Pt [38]. For example,
the activation energy for butane hydrogenolysis over
Ni powders is reported to be 44 kcal/mol [49].
The apparent activation energy for butane conver-
sion over the W2N catalyst was 32 kcal/mol. This
material was very selective for butane isomerization.

The isomerization of butane over Pt powders is char-
acterized by an activation energy of 24 kcal/mol [32]
while Pd is reported to have an activation energy of
38 kcal/mol [50]. Activation energies for butane
dehydrogenation over the vanadium nitride and car-
bide catalysts were 38 and 41 kcal/mol, respectively.
These values are higher than those reported for cyclo-
hexane dehydrogenation over monometallic W and
Mo carbides (2023 kcal/mol) but similar to those
reported for mixed WMo carbides (3040 kcal/
mol) [51]. The results indicate that the apparent
activation energies depended on the type of reaction
but were not very sensitive to the type of catalyst.
5. Summary
A series of Group Vand VI transition metal nitrides
and carbides were prepared via TPR of the appropriate
oxide with NH3 or an equimolar mixture of CH4 and
H2. The resulting materials were characterized using
X-ray diffraction and sorption analysis, and evaluated
for the activation of butane. The materials were phase-
pure and the carbides were devoid of excess carbon.
The Group VI metal nitrides and carbides contained a
small amount of microporosity, however, like the
Group V metal compounds, the highest density of
pores were in the mesopore range. Except for NbN and
NbC, all of the materials were active, catalyzing the
dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and/or isomeriza-
tion of butane. Butane consumption rates for the
nitrides and carbides were typically greater than those
for a commercial PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The corre-
sponding activities (surface area normalized reaction
rate) ranged up to 1.01013 molecules/cm2 s and
decreased in the following order: Mo2N>W2CWC
>W2NWC1x>Mo2C>VNVCNbNNbC. Turn-
over frequencies estimated for the nitride and carbide
catalysts were of the same order of magnitude as that
for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, activities for
the nitrides and carbides were comparable with those
reported for Pt powders.
We were able to quantitatively assess inuences of
the non-metal atom type, metal atom type and lattice
structure on catalytic properties of the nitrides and
carbides. The metal atom type had the most signicant
effect. The Group VI compounds were much more
active than the Group V metal nitrides and carbides,
and their selectivities were different. The Group VI
transition metal nitrides and carbides primarily cata-
lyzed the hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation of
butane. The W2N catalyst also had a high selectivity
to isomerized products. The Group V compounds
selectively catalyzed butane dehydrogenation. The
different activities and selectivities are believed to
be due to variations in their electronic structures.
The lattice structure also had a signicant inuence
on the catalytic properties, however, the effect of the
non-metal atom type was insignicant.
The
mechanism
for
butane
hydrogenolysis
appeared to be similar for all of the nitrides and
carbides. Except for the Mo2C catalyst, hydrogeno-
lysis occurred preferentially at the central CC bond.
For the Mo2C catalyst hydrogenolysis occurred with
nearly identical frequencies at the central and terminal
CC bonds. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst favored hydro-
genolysis at the terminal CC bond. Olen to parafn
ratios for the nitrides and carbides were small indicat-
ing a preference for saturated products during hydro-
genolysis.
Apparent activation energies for butane conversion
over the nitrides and carbides ranged from 18 to
41 kcal/mol. These values are similar to those pre-
viously reported for tungsten carbide and Pt-group
metal catalysts.
