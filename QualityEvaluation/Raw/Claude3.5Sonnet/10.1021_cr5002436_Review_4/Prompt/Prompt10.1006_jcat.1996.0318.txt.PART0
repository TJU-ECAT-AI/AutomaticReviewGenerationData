Zirconia-supported iron oxide catalysts were prepared by incipi-
ent wetness impregnation, followed by drying and calcination in air.
Characterization of the catalysts was performed with electron mi-
croscopy combined with element analysis (HR-TEM/EDAX), X-ray
diffraction(XRD),temperature-programmedreduction(TPR),and
thermomagnetic analysis. A homogeneous distribution of the iron
containing phase can be obtained by using the metal complexes am-
monium iron (III) citrate or ammonium (III) iron EDTA. A simple
salt, such as iron nitrate, proved to be less suitable for this purpose.
By HR-TEM/EDAX, it was shown that coverage of the zirconia sup-
port had been accomplished. XRD showed that crystalline Fe2O3
particles were formed at loadings 3 wt% Fe. TPR studies point
to a bi-modal particle size distribution for the catalysts with 3 wt%
Fe. Above this loading (>3 wt%) bulk properties prevail in TPR,
whereas at lower loadings (<3 wt%) no distinct iron oxide species
could be indicated. Magnetization measurements confirmed the re-
sults obtained by TPR. Catalysts prepared by coimpregnation of
iron and potassium were also studied. TEM and XRD results show
that a well-dispersed phase is obtained, but from XRD only potas-
sium carbonate and no iron oxide or ferrite is evident. It was also
found that the presence of potassium increases the onset of reduc-
tion of the iron phase by about 100C.

1. INTRODUCTION
The use of a supported iron oxide catalyst can provide
a successful remedy for overcoming the problems encoun-
tered with the industrially applied bulk catalysts used for
the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylben-
zene (1, 2). The availability as commercial preshaped sup-
port bodies and proper physico-chemical properties (acid
base characteristics of the material, thermal, and chemical
stability) are requirements for the support material. As dis-
cussed elsewhere (3), zirconia may be a promising support
to be applied in dehydrogenation catalysts.

Since iron containing oxides are known to be favor-
able catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., 4, 5), the
development of a suitable preparation procedure for the
present active phase-support combination is of interest.
Therefore, the preparation, characterization, and catalytic
testing of zirconia-supported iron-based catalysts were in-
vestigated. The preparation and characterization are re-
ported in the present paper (part I).
Few examples of the iron-on-zirconia (powder) catalyst
system are encountered in literature. This is due to the fact
that zirconia has only recently been used and studied more
oftenasacatalystsupportmaterial.Whenzirconiaisusedas
a support in investigations on iron containing catalysts, it is
usuallyincorporatedinaseriesofvarioussupportmaterials.
For example, Ji et al. (6, 7) performed a study on supported
iron oxide catalysts, in which they also included zirconia.
Essentially, the catalysts were prepared by one procedure,
viz., adsorption from (excess) aqueous iron salt solutions
under various conditions. Van Ommen et al. (8) investigated
the preparation of iron oxide-on-zirconia by adsorption of
iron acetylacetonate from organic solvents (as a minor part
of a study on supported catalysts). The main goal of their
work was to investigate the adsorption procedure itself. The
mostrecentreportinliteratureonazirconia-supportediron
catalyst is a paper by Guglielminotti (9), but no special at-
tention was paid to the preparation of the catalyst (wet
impregnation with iron nitrate of a precipitated zirconia).
Spectroscopic studies were carried out to investigate the
interaction between zirconia and reduced iron oxides. It
was found that zirconia has a stabilizing influence on iron
(II) species: spreading of these species caused a decreased
reducibility of iron (III) via iron (II) to metallic iron.
The presently operated dehydrogenation processes use
a fixed catalyst bed, which calls for mechanically strong
catalyst bodies of at least some millimeters in diameter. In
order to avoid shaping operations, the use of preshaped
zirconia support bodies is required. Therefore, the re-
sults of suitable preparation procedures, such as impreg-
nation of the preshaped support bodies with solutions of

chelating compounds, are of interest. Descriptions of the
successful impregnation of preshaped support bodies with
a solution of precursor compounds of the active compo-
nent can be found in literature. Meima reported on the
use of chelated complexes, such as metalEDTA (ethylene-
diaminetetraacetate), metalcitrate, and metalformate
(10, 11), which yielded homogeneous distributions of the
active phase throughout the wide-pore α-alumina support
bodies. Stobbe (4, 12) extended this procedure to the prepa-
ration of iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts supported
on magnesia. Again, chelating agents provided the best re-
sults because of their stabilizing influence on iron toward
hydroxylation (and subsequent imhomogeneous precipita-
tion) by the strongly basic magnesia support.
Although chelating agents have proved to be useful
iron precursor compounds, the employment of a simple
salt might be profitable if this also would produce a well-
distributed iron phase on the zirconia support. Therefore,
the application of metal complexes (ammonium iron (III)
citrate, ammonium iron (III) EDTA) as well as a simple salt
(nitrate) on to various preshaped zirconias has been stud-
ied in the present paper (part I). Characterization of the
catalysts with transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
diffraction is described. As a measure of the interaction be-
tween the applied iron oxide phases and the support the
reducibility of the iron containing phase has been studied.
The reduction behavior can also yield information on the
phases which are formed during the dehydrogenation of
1-butane. The results of the study of the present catalyst
system using this catalytic test reaction will be reported in
part II of this work (this issue).
2. METHODS
Catalyst Preparation
Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregna-
tion, using three different preshaped zirconia carriers (3):
Two batches of Daiichi RSC-H zirconia (designated I and
II (3, 13); 100% monoclinic, pellets φ 3 mm); Engelhard
L6132 zirconia (mixture of 60% monoclinic and 40% tetra-
gonal modifications, pellets φ 3 mm) to study the influence
of a different crystal modification; Norton XZ 16052 (100%
monoclinic, extrudates φ 3 mm) to study the use of a differ-
ently shaped support. All supports were treated at 850C in
air for 16 h to obtain a stable specific surface area of about
20 m2/g and a pore volume of about 0.25, 0.17, and 0.22 ml/g,
for the three supports, recpectively.
Ammonium Fe(III) citrate (Merck, 28% Fe), ammonium
Fe(III) EDTA (prepared according to Stobbe et al. (12)),
or iron (III) nitrate nonhydrate (Merck, p.A.) were used as
precursor compounds; aqueous precursor solutions were
added to evacuated support bodies to obtain a loading of
3 wt% Fe. Higher loadings were obtained by multiple im-
pregnation, with intermediate drying and calcination steps.
Using the EDTA solution, the maximum attainable loading
in one step is about 1.5 wt% Fe.
Potassium containing samples (typically 3 wt% K) were
prepared by coimpregnation with an ammonium Fe(III)
citrate and potassium carbonate solution.
The impregnation liquid was allowed to enter the support
pellets for about 1 h at static vacuum. In order to investigate
the influence of the drying rate catalysts were dried at room
temperature either rapidly in flowing air for 2 h or slowly
in static air for 16 h.
Finally, calcination of the samples took place in flowing
air, by the following procedure: 150C for 2 h, 500C for
2 h, 750C for 16 h (ramp between stages, 5C/min).
A physical mixture of pretreated zirconium dioxide and
iron(III)oxide(3wt%Fe)waspreparedbymanuallygrind-
ing the oxides in a mortar. The iron oxide was prepared
separately by calcining ammonium Fe(III) citrate (Merck,
28% Fe) in air at 750C for 16 h.
Characterization Techniques
Transmission electron microscopy.
For electron micro-
scopic studies samples were prepared by applying a few
droplets of a dispersion of a finely ground catalyst ultra-
sonically treated in ethanol onto a holey carbon film sup-
ported by a copper grid. High resolution measurements
and energy-dispersive element analysis were performed in
a Philips CM-20 transmission electron microscope (200 kV)
equipped with a field-emission gun.
Determination of textural properties.
The specific sur-
face areas of the bare supports and the catalysts were de-
termined by nitrogen physisorption at liquid nitrogen tem-
perature according to the BET-method. A surface area of
0.162 nm2 for the physically adsorbed N2 molecule was
used for calculation of the BET surface area. Measure-
ments were carried out either by dynamic physisorption
(Quantasorb apparatus, Quantachrome Corp.) or by static
physisorption (ASAP 2400, Micromeritics); the latter tech-
nique also provides a pore distribution up to 100 nm and
information on the microporosity of the samples (t-plot
method). Fractured samples of a particle size of 0.50
0.85 mm were outgassed at 200C for 2 h prior to the
measurements.
Powder X-ray diffraction.
Powder XRD was carried
out in a Philips powder diffractometer mounted on a
Philips PW1140 X-ray generator using FeKα1,2 radiation
(1.93735 
A).
Temperature-programmed reduction.
Reduction exper-
iments were performed in an atmospheric (plug-)flow
reactor using a thermal conductivity detector to monitor
the hydrogen consumption. Water produced in the reduc-
tion reaction was frozen out using CO2 (s/g) cold trap. A
fractured catalyst sample (0.500.85 mm) was reduced in
a 50 ml/min 10 or 70% (v/v) H2/Ar gas flow, while the

temperature was changed from RT to about 900C at a
linear heating rate of 5C/min.
Thermo-magnetical analysis.
High-field magnetic mea-
surements to study the reduction behavior were performed
using a modified Weiss extraction technique as described
by Stobbe et al. (14). The apparatus allowed in situ magne-
tization measurements at a field strength of 7000 Oe of frac-
tured catalyst samples during heating/cooling in helium or
reduction in 10% H2/Ar up to 525C with a heating/cooling
rate of 0.5C/min.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Catalyst Preparation
All impregnation liquid utilized were able to wet the cata-
lyst support bodies homogeneously and completely during
the impregnation step. It was established that on all sup-
ports redistribution of the precursor over the support pel-
lets occurred exclusively during the drying step. The drying
step is known to greatly influence the macroscopic distri-
bution of an impregnated phase within the support bodies
(15). The subsequent calcination step did not further affect
the obtained distribution.
Impregnation with ammonium iron (III) citrate pro-
duced homogeneously loaded catalyst pellets at both drying
rates (3, 16). When using other precursors, i.e., iron (III) ni-
trate and ammonium iron (III) EDTA, the following obser-
vations were made. The use of nitrate always resulted in an
eggshell distribution. As an alternative procedure the ad-
dition of small amounts of a compound which increases the
viscosity of the solution, such as, e.g., agarose or hydrox-
yethylcellulose (HEC), was tried. This route to the final
catalyst was, however, not continued, since no better re-
sults were obtained than when using only the complexing
agents. With supports impregnated with ammonium iron
(III) EDTA solutions only slow drying resulted in homo-
geneous distributions. Besides this effect, an influence of
the pH of the impregnating solution could be observed,
which has also been reported for silica-supported catalysts
(17). With zirconia best results were obtained with EDTA
solutions just above the uncorrected pH after preparation
of the complex (pH 5.5), viz., at pH 6 or 7. Increasing
the pH of the solution to higher values did not improve
the distribution, but resulted in eggshell distributions after
drying.
The above-mentioned results apply to catalysts with a
typical Fe loading of about 3 wt% (or 1.5 wt% with EDTA
solutions). Higher loadings (e.g., 6 or 9 wt% Fe) were ob-
tained by multiple impregnation steps. Essentially the same
effects were important as with catalysts containing 3 wt%
Fe: usually catalysts with a higher loading were prepared
starting with the homogeneously impregnated 3 wt% cat-
alysts. It was established that the final distribution of the
iron phase was determined by the distribution established
during the first stage of the preparation: when an inhomoge-
neous loaded support body was impregnated, no improve-
ment of the distribution could be achieved.
It was possible to obtain catalysts containing both iron
and potassium with a macroscopically homogeneous iron
distribution throughout the various supports. Again, opti-
mal results were obtained using a low drying rate. How-
ever, the influence of the drying rate was less pronounced
than with catalysts containing iron precursors only. Possibly
the formation of a complex in which the ammonium group
is replaced by a potassium ion plays a role here. Little is
known in literature about both the solid state and the solu-
tion chemistry of these complexes, especially at concentra-
tions approaching saturation as in the solutions used here.
The formation of gaseous ammonia and carbon dioxide can
be observed when preparing the impregnating solution (in-
dicating the proceeding substitution reaction). Although
the precise function of the ammonium citrate complex is
not known as yet, it is conceivable that this replacement
may induce different physico-chemical properties (crystal-
lization behavior, viscosity, surface tension or adsorption,
etc.). One or both of these modified properties may ac-
count for the better results of coimpregnation (17, 18). On
the other hand, the mere presence of a higher amount of
dissolved precursors probably increases the viscosity, which
could also improve the desired characteristics of the solu-
tion for obtaining a homogeneous distribution.
When inspecting the catalysts after calcination, it was im-
mediately clear that a different, olive green colored, phase
had been formed. Moreover, the color changed to light
brown very rapidly upon exposure to atmospheric air. This
indicates that in the presence of potassium the formation
of a potassium ferrite phase takes place. When no potas-
sium was present, the catalysts all showed the reddish light-
browncolor(thebrightnessdependingontheloading)char-
acteristic of iron (III) oxides.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmissionelectronmicroscopy(TEM)wasperformed
on calcined Daiichi (batch I) zirconia-supported iron oxide
catalysts. Discrimination between support crystallites and
small crystalline iron oxide particles on the surface, which
both exhibit diffraction contrast, is quite difficult. There-
fore, it is hard to determine whether the active phase has
indeed been applied onto the support surface. Using scan-
ning electron microscopy the applied iron oxide cannot be
observed. At high magnifications, a decoration of the zirco-
nia crystallites by very small particles (φ < 0.5 nm (3)) ap-
pears to be visible. This may be the applied iron oxide phase,
but this effect could also be caused by surface roughness of
the zirconia crystallites. In order to study the nature of this
decoration, element analysis using a field emission gun pro-
viding an extremely narrow and bright electron beam was
performed. A high surface concentration of iron could be

detected when analyzing the edge of a support crystallite.
When the surface of the zirconia crystallites is covered uni-
formly with small iron oxide entities, and we consider a
zirconia platelet oriented perpendicularly to the electron
beam, the thickness of the iron oxide layer in the direction
of the electron beam is higher at the edge of the zirconia
crystallite than at the center. Consequently, element analy-
sis at the center leads to an iron-to-zirconium ratio that
is lower than that measured at the edge. The results of this
experiment are presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1. It can be de-
rived that indeed a highly dispersed iron containing phase
covering the zirconia surface is present.
In coimpregnated samples, the active components can be
located more easily with TEM. It appeared that in samples
in which 3 wt% iron and 3 wt% potassium had been de-
posited on zirconia the support is covered more or less com-
pletely with an apparently amorphous layer of deposited
material (3, 16). Since these structures were completely ab-

active components are present in this layer.
Catalyst Texture
The specific surface areas and pore structures of the cata-
lysts with loadings up to 3 wt% Fe (Table 2) are similar
to the textural parameters measured for the bare supports
(3). When potassium is applied also, the pores are filled at
lowerironloadings.Themicroporesurfacefollowsthesame
trend. However, it is not reduced to zero at high loadings
of iron and potassium.
X-ray Diffraction
The intense diffraction pattern of zirconia can obscure
diffraction peaks originating from deposited active phases.
Fortunately, the most intense diffraction peak of the ferric
oxide expected to be formed after calcination of catalysts
containing only supported iron oxide, viz. the peak due to
the (104) plane of hematite (α-Fe2O3) at d = 0.270 nm, does
not coincide with any of the zirconia peaks.
DiffractogramsoftheFe/ZrO2catalysts(Fig.2)showthat
a crystalline iron compound has been formed upon calcina-
tion at 750C. In catalysts with homogeneous distributions
of iron oxide, the most intense hematite diffraction peak
(104) is hardly discernible from the noise in the diffrac-
togram, indicating the presence of only a small amount of
larger crystalline iron oxide particles. When a loading of less
than 3% is applied, no hematite diffractions are detected.
Whenhigherloadings(6 or 9wt%Fe)areapplied(Fig.3),
an increase of the intensity of the hematite (104) peak is ob-
served. From the X-ray diffractograms it can be concluded
that the additional amount of iron oxide deposited ends up
largely in crystalline bulk iron oxide particles.
The particle diameters calculated from line broadening
using the Scherrer equation (3) range from 20 to 30 nm
for the 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst. No iron oxide particles of
such dimensions were observed in TEM, but comparison

of the hematite peak intensities in the diffractograms of
the 3 wt% Fe/ZrO2 catalyst with that of a physical mix-
ture with the same iron content (Fig. 2) suggests that only
a small amount of these larger iron oxide crystallites was
present. Moreover, the crystallinity of the support can ob-
scure scarcely present hematite crystallites in TEM. The
results therefore do not necessarily disagree.
XRD was also applied to the catalysts containing both
iron and potassium. Since the olive green color of the
zirconia-supported catalysts after calcination indicated the
formation of potassium ferrite (KFeO2), which is known
to decompose readily in atmospheric air, diffractograms
were recorded excluding air. These catalysts, although still
olive green, exhibited only the lines of excess potassium car-
bonates (K2CO3 and K2CO3 · 3/2 H2O), and no additional
diffraction lines due to other phases than zirconia were de-
tected (Fig. 4). Also after decomposition of potassium fer-
rite, characterized by the complete color change from olive
green to brown, only potassium carbonate diffraction peaks
were visible. These results are concordant with the TEM ob-
servations, which revealed the existence of an amorphous
layer in the coimpregnated catalysts.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction
TPR profiles of zirconia-supported iron oxide catalysts
are displayed in Figs. 59.
It was found that the application of two different hydro-
gen partial pressures, viz., 10 and 70% H2 (v/v) in Ar, re-
sulted only in trivial differences in the obtained reduction
profiles (Fig. 5); i.e., the use of a higher hydrogen partial
pressure caused the catalysts to be reduced completely at
lower temperatures, while the use of a lower H2 pressure
gives a better resolution of the different reduction peaks.
This can easily be explained by combining thermodynamic

and kinetic effects: the higher pH2/pH2O ratio causes the
reduction to complete at lower temperatures (19), and the
higher H2 concentration itself can increase the overlap of
reduction peaks (20).
To attribute the reduction peaks to the transformations
of distinct iron oxides by analyzing the reduction profiles
only is difficult. In the (10% H2) profiles of the catalyst
ex citrate, e.g., at least four reduction stages can be seen
(Fig. 5). It is obvious that the profile cannot be explained by
stating that it represents the reduction of hematite via mag-
netite and w
ustite to α-iron, as is done commonly (e.g., 8).
It is more likely that a combination of effects is responsible
for the complicated profiles. As was derived by combin-
ing the TEM and XRD results, both very small and larger
iron oxide species are present in the catalysts. The differ-
ence in particle size itself can give rise to the occurrence
of split peaks for essentially the same reduction reaction
(21, 22) and also the difference in the stabilizing interaction
that iron oxide species experience if they are either well-
dispersed and in intimate contact with the zirconia support
or more bulk-like and clustered together. The possible exis-

tence of such a stabilizing effect of oxidic supports on Fe2+ is
well-documented in literature (e.g., 23, 24) and has recently
been found to be operative in zirconia-supported iron ox-
ide catalysts as well (9). Although the individual processes
proceeding cannot easily be assigned, the TPR results can
be used as a fingerprint for comparing the catalysts. It can
be derived that the supported iron oxide phases experience
an influence of the support which causes reduction of the
iron phase to take place over a larger temperature range
than is found with bulk catalysts and physical mixtures (8),
suggesting the existence a certain degree of interaction with
support.
When the loadings are increased, the reduction profiles
resemble the profile displayed by the physical mixture; i.e.,
the reduction proceeds in a single unresolved step (Fig. 6).
This is an agreement with XRD, which also revealed the
presence of a more bulk-like iron oxide upon increasing the
loading. When the loading is decreased (Fig. 7), the profile
becomes less resolved, and less peaks exist. This seems to
indicate the presence of less different types of iron oxide
species in catalysts with loadings below 3 wt% Fe. From the
normalized TPR profiles and the calculated final degree of

reduction (which approaches 100% with all catalysts), it
can be concluded that reduction has completed at lower
temperatures with the catalysts of the lowest loadings. This
is likely to be caused by the smaller amount of water vapor
to be removed from the pore system upon reduction of
these catalysts.
Some more information can be derived about the inter-
action in catalysts prepared using different zirconia sup-
ports (Fig. 8) or different precursor compounds (Fig. 9).
In catalysts containing only iron oxide as the active phase,
it is observed that the first onset of reduction is at the
same temperature with all samples. The samples supported
on Norton ZrO2 closely resemble the samples supported
on Daiichi ZrO2, whereas complete reduction is retarded
in the catalysts prepared using the Engelhard support. An
iron dispersion different from that mentioned above show-
ing a few large iron oxide particles next to a large fraction of
small iron oxide species has not been found for these cata-
lysts with TEM nor XRD. The different reduction profile of
the catalyst with the Engelhard zirconia must be attributed
to other causes. As has been reported elsewhere (3), the
large Engelhard support material displays a hydrogen con-

sumption starting at about 600C. The reduction of zirconia
can therefore be expected to be observed in the reduction
profile of the iron oxide supported on Engelhard. When the
total hydrogen consumption is calculated for this catalyst,
and the area of the second peak is subtracted, a value for the
extent of reduction of iron oxide of around 100% results. In
this catalyst, the reduction peaks of iron oxide and zirconia
exhibit a considerable overlap, rendering any conclusions
on the supported phase rather uncertain.
When comparing the catalysts ex EDTA and citrate sup-
ported on Daiichi (II) zirconia (Fig. 9), it is observed that in
the case of EDTA a less resolved TPR profile is obtained.
With the catalysts ex citrate of a lower loading (e.g., 1 wt%
Fe) this was also observed. The lower loading of the catalyst
ex EDTA (1.4 wt% Fe) must be taken into account here:
it seems that the same reduction behavior is observed for
the catalyst prepared with either the citrate or the EDTA
precursor.
Addition of potassium carbonate shifts the onset temper-
atures of the initial reduction to temperatures about 100C
higher than in catalysts without potassium (Fig. 10). This
effect has been observed before (25). Possible explanations
are the presence of a compound of iron and potassium (e.g.,
potassium ferrite) displaying a different reduction behav-
ior; the coverage of the iron compound by potassium car-
bonate after decomposition of potassium ferrite limiting its
accessibility for hydrogen; and the mere presence of the
potassium compound, filling the catalyst pores and imped-
ing the removal of water vapor. Whether the retarded re-
duction is caused by one or by a combination of more of
the above-mentioned effects is difficult to assess.
Also effects of the particle size distribution, which have
been mentioned when discussing the catalysts containing
iron only apply here. Attribution of the separate peaks to
discrete reduction processes will therefore not be feasible,
with one exception. In agreement with Stobbe et al. (25), the
reduction peak with an onset temperature of about 700C
is attributed to the reduction of potassium carbonate: the

effect of the Fe/K ratio (Fig. 10) supports this attribution,
since an increase of the potassium loading and therefore
of the excess potassium carbonate content results in an in-
crease in the height of this peak. Also in situ formation
of potassium ferrite and simultaneous carbon dioxide evo-
lution could be responsible for a positive detector signal,
but this would require a substantial amount of remaining
trivalent iron. The calculated total degree of reduction be-
fore the onset of the last peak (about 100%) excludes this
possibility.
Thermo-magnetic Analysis
High-field measurements have been performed to follow
the magnetic properties during TPR (Fig. 11). At the onset
temperature of about 300C formation of a magnetic phase,
most probably magnetite, is observed. Then the magnetic
signal shortly stabilizes, after which it increases, eventually
to a high level, indicating the formation of magnetic iron.
This is in agreement with TPR results in which the hydrogen
consumption is measured, which also indicate a more or less
parallel reduction of iron (III) and iron (II) taking place in
the sample and show that predominantly Fe(0) is present
at the end of the reduction experiments.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Procedures developed earlier for preparing supported
iron catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation of pre-
shaped support bodies can also be applied to zirconia sup-
ports. A homogeneous distribution of the iron containing
phase can be obtained by using complex salts such as am-
monium iron (III) citrate or ammonium iron EDTA. A
simple salt such as iron nitrate proved to be less suitable.
This confirms the results reported by other authors (4, 10
12, 17, 18). However, the effect of the pH with the EDTA
precursor shows that valid results and hypotheses for one
system (silica-supported iron oxide) cannot be generalized:
the supposed effect of the tendency of the EDTA precursor
to crystallize is either not operative here or is obscured by
another parameter, e.g., the pore-size distribution. It was
found that redistribution of the applied phases occurred
only during the drying step.
By element analysis and HR-TEM, it was unambiguously
demonstrated that a coverage of the zirconia support with
very small iron oxide species had been accomplished. XRD
showed that crystalline iron oxide particles were formed at
loadings higher than 3 wt% Fe.
TPR experiments also point to bi-modal particle size
distributions of the supported iron oxide, since complex
reduction profiles are obtained at loadings of the active
component higher than about 3 wt%. Above this critical
loading bulk-like properties are displayed in TPR. At lower
loadings (<3 wt% Fe) lower reduction temperatures are
required for the complete reduction of the supported iron
oxide. Magnetization measurements confirm the results ob-
tained by TPR.
Catalysts prepared by coimpregnation with a solution of
potassium iron (III) citrate which is obtained from ammo-
nium iron (III) citrate and potassium carbonate were also
studied. XRD results show that a well-dispersed supported
phase results: only (excess) potassium carbonate and no
iron oxide or ferrite is apparent. In combination with the
fact that the olive green potassium ferrite formed initially
decomposes very rapidly upon exposure to atmospheric air,
all results support the conclusion that a well-dispersed sup-
ported active phase has been obtained. It was also found
that potassium raises the temperature of the onset of re-
duction of the iron phase by about 100C.
The performance of the presently prepared catalyst sys-
tems in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene, will be described
in part II of this work (this issue). Zirconia is a suitable
support for preparing a supported dehydrogenation cata-
lyst:itdispersestheironoxidephasemicroscopically(TEM,
XRD), it does not form bulk mixed compounds with iron or
potassium (XRD), and the homogeneous application of the
catalytically active phases throughout the catalyst support
body is feasible.
