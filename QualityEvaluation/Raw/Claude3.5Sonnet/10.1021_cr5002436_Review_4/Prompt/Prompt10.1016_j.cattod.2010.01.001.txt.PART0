for the accomplishment of the complete catalytic cycle

1. Introduction
One of the perspective catalysts for the transformation of light
alkanes in more valuable products as alkenes, aromatic com-
pounds and hydrogen is Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite [18]. The extensive
experimental [2,7,911] studies of these zeolites have suggested
that depending on the method for preparation of the samples
several types of Zn-containing cationic species might exist and/or
act as active sites for dehydrogenation of ethane or propane. Due to
its +2 positive charge, the bare Zn2+ cation is accommodated
typically in vicinity of the parts of zeolite framework containing
two closely located Al centers and in this way the local
electroneutrality of the zeolite system is preserved. In addition
to these regular zinc cationic sites located at Al pairs, Zn2+ cations
are suggested to exists as partially compensated species in
vicinity of isolated Al sites and far from the second Al center which
virtually accomplishes the charge compensation for the whole
zeolite framework. Such type of sites is proposed to exist when the
Zn,H-ZSM-5 sample is prepared by exchange of H-ZSM-5 zeolite
with Zn vapors [10,1214]. Other proposed types are ZnOH+ [9]
and ZnOZn2+ [1519] species. While confirming the existence of
the former type of species, presumably in vicinity of isolated Al
sites, Iglesia and co-workers discarded the latter species in samples
prepared by ion exchange on the base EXAFS investigation [2].
Such ZnOZn2+ species is confirmed to exist only when Zn,H-ZSM-5
is prepared by incipient wetness impregnation [2,1517,19]. We
have recently modeled computationally four different types of
cationic
Zn
species,
Zn2+,
ZnOH+,
Zn(H2O)2+
and
ZnOZn2+,
coordinated to fragments of ZSM-5 zeolite [2023] and found
that at zeolite fragments containing two Al centers the most stable
Zn species are Zn(H2O)2+. In such position the ZnOH+ species are
unstable since they spontaneously attract the zeolite proton from
the neighboring bridging OH group, which compensates the charge
of the second Al atom in the zeolite fragment, and form
Zn(H2O)2+easily. By this reason ZnOH+ species in Zn,H-ZSM-5
zeolites can exist only in vicinity of isolated Al sites, in agreement
with previous experimental hypothesis [2]. On the other hand,
several
computational
studies
[20,21,24,25]
suggested
that
ZnOZn2+ species are considerably less stable compared to the
other cationic Zn-containing species in zeolite.
Experimentally, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes was
found to occur on Zn,H-ZSM-5 samples prepared by ion exchange
[1,4,68], impregnation [5,7], and Zn vapor deposition [4,5].
According to Iglesia and co-workers, the role of Zn species in the
catalytic process is facilitation of the recombination and desorp-
tion of H2 from the catalytic site [1,3]. By IR spectroscopy Kazansky
and Pidko [12] established formation of ethanide Zn(C2H5)+ species
and restoration of bridging OH groups after heating the sample

Ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 was modeled by density functional calculations on isolated
zeolite fragment. Three types of cationic Zn species, that are assumed to exist in the samples prepared by
ion exchange, were considered as active sites for the process: Zn2+ in the vicinity of paired Al centers as
well as ZnOH+ and ZnH+ in the vicinity of one isolated Al site. For all modeled mechanisms and active
sites we accounted for the influence of the entropy. The results suggest that the process on Zn2+ cation at
paired Al site has the lowest free energy of activation. The calculations also highlight the essential role of
the second Al center in vicinity of the zinc cation for the reaction since it generates basic framework
oxygen center participating in the reaction steps with lowest activation barrier. In absence of a second Al
center close to the zinc species (as in the models with isolated Al sites) the reaction is blocked due to
formation of rather stable intermediates ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ that cannot be decomposed due to the too
high activation barriers on the next stages of the dehydrogenation process.

with ethane adsorbed on Zn,H-ZSM-5 prepared by Zn vapor
deposition.
There are also several computational studies of the reaction
mechanism. In an early investigation, Frash and van Santen [26]
modeled
ethane
dehydrogenation
on
Zn2+
located
at
four-
membered ring and showed that the dissociation of the ethane
molecule to carbanion C2H5
 and H+ is energetically more
favorable compared to the alternative carbenium mechanism via
dissociation to C2H5
+ and H. Zhidomirov et al. [27] considered the
process on Zn2+, located close to only one Al center in a five-
membered zeolite ring, while a second Al center is positioned in
the neighboring ring. The reaction intermediate Zn(C2H5)+ in this
case is rather stable, 135 kJ/mol, since H+ released from ethane
dissociation compensates the distantly located second Al center.
The second stage, b-transfer of hydride anion from the CH3 group
to the Zn center resulting in formation of C2H4 and ZnH+ species
has apparent activation barrier (energy of the transition state,
calculated with respect to the reactants) of 65 kJ/mol, while the
final step  recombination and desorption of H2, has high apparent
activation energy, above 200 kJ/mol [28], since the regeneration of
the catalytic site results in formation of one uncompensated Al
center.
Recently, Pidko and van Santen modeled ethane dehydrogena-
tion on Zn2+ ions, located close to one or two Al centers, as well as
on ZnOZn2+ species [29]. After the initial heterolytic dissociation of
ethane, they suggested alternative way for decomposition of C2H5
into ethene via simultaneous formation of H2 by a hydride from the
methyl group and proton from the bridging OH group of the zeolite
produced in the first step of the mechanism. In this way the
apparent activation energy for this reaction on Zn2+ located close to
two Al centers is 222 or 226 kJ/mol, depending on which O center
participates in the initial proton abstraction. According to the
authors, the apparent activation energy decreases to 153 kJ/mol
when the reaction takes place on Zn2+ ions located close to only one
Al center. The explanation of the catalytic activity of Zn,H-ZSM-5
zeolites on the base only of partially compensated Zn2+ species,
however, meets two problems:
(i) formation of such centers requires overcoming of rather high
electrostatic energy [30,31];
(ii) such species are proposed to exist only when the sample is
prepared by treatment with Zn vapor [10,12,13], while the
ethane dehydrogenation occurs also on Zn,H-ZSM-5 samples
prepared by ion exchange or by impregnation (in particular for
Si/Al ratios <40), where the zinc-containing ions located close
to isolated Al centers are proposed to be monovalence ZnOH+
species.
In the present investigation we modeled the mechanism of ethane
dehydrogenation on cationic Zn-containing species located close to
isolated and paired Al sites, which could exist in pores of Zn,H-ZSM-5
zeolites prepared by ion-exchange technique. In the case of paired Al
centers as active sites we considered bare Zn2+ cations produced after
desorption of water molecule from the most stable species in such
position, Zn(H2O)2+, at the typical reaction temperature, 723823 K
[1,3,7,32]. At isolated Al sites we modeled the reaction on ZnOH+ and
ZnH+; the latter species could be formed during the interaction
between ZnOH+ and ethane. In addition to the carbanionic mecha-
nism considered in the previous computational studies [26,27,29], we
studied a synchronous mechanism, in which in one step a hydride ion
and a proton from ethane are transferred to the Zn2+ species and O
center of the active site, respectively. In this way the ethene molecule
is formed and leaves without adsorption on the catalytic center. At
variance from the previous studies, for the transition states of all
modeled mechanisms and active sites we considered in details the
influence of the entropy, which is crucial for the correct analysis of the
preferred mechanism at the high reaction temperature, above 700 K
[1,3,7,32]. We have shown that the presence of the second Al center in
vicinity of the zinc cation is essential for the reaction since it
generates basic oxygen center participating in the reaction steps with
lowest activation barrier. In absence of a second Al center close to the
zinc species the reaction is blocked due to formation of rather stable
intermediates that cannot be decomposed due to the too high
activation barriers.
2. Methods and models
Initially, we optimized the MFI structure at the molecular
mechanical (MM) level with the program GULP [33], using a
previously reported shell model force field (FF) [34,35]. From this
structure we choose a model cluster representing five-membered
zeolite ring to be treated at the quantum mechanical level. In MFI
structure this ring faces the main channel of the structure. The
cluster (denoted as zeolite fragment Z2), used for modeling of
ethane dehydrogenation on Zn2+ species, contains two Al centers,
located at the crystallographic positions T2 and T9. The other
model cluster (denoted as zeolite fragment Z1), used for modeling
of ethane dehydrogenation on ZnOH+ and ZnH+, has the same
structure but contains only one Al center at the position T9.
The dangling bonds were saturated by H atoms, and the
direction of these bonds at the cluster boundary was fixed as
obtained in the zeolite structure optimized with the MM model.
The lengths of the corresponding TH or OH bonds were pre-
optimized, keeping all other atoms in the cluster fixed, followed by
an optimization of the cluster with fixed positions of all saturating
H atoms. In the subsequent geometry optimization steps, only the
positions of the oxygen centers, the protons of the bridging OH
groups, and the guest species were relaxed, while the positions of
terminated H atoms and T atoms were fixed.
The calculations were performed with the program Gaus-
sian03W [36] using the gradient-corrected exchange-correlation
functional suggested by Becke and Perdew [37] with 6-311+G**
type of basis sets for all atoms.
The enthalpies of all investigated species were obtained from
the calculated electronic energies corrected for the zero point
vibrational energy derived from frequency calculations of the
optimized structures; in addition we also took into account the
internal thermal energy. The calculated vibrational frequencies are
in
harmonic
approximation,
as
the
force
constants
of
the
vibrational modes are obtained analytically. Since part of the
system is fixed during the geometry optimization, this leads to
appearance of imaginary frequencies (negative force constants).
These frequencies were suppressed by removing the contributions
of the fixed atoms in the Hessian matrix. All obtained transition
states have only one imaginary frequency, which corresponds to
the eigenvector, corresponding to the reaction path.
The reported entropy of the reactants, intermediates and
transition states includes the contributions of all degrees of
freedom for the gas molecules and only vibrational degrees of
freedom for the zeolite clusters and the adsorption complexes. The
frustrated rotational and translational modes of the guest species
were accounted for as a part of the vibrational component of the
partition function.
3. Results
As it was described in Section 1, at high temperature the type of
the preferred zinc species in the pores of Zn,H-ZSM-5, prepared by
ion exchange, depends on the relative location of the Al centers in
the framework: at isolated Al center this is ZnOH+ and at two
closely located Al centers (e.g. Al pair) this is Zn2+. By this reason
we investigated the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on two

cluster models: Z2/Zn2+ (Fig. 1), where Zn2+ is coordinated to a
zeolite fragment containing two Al centers, and Z1/ZnOH+ with
ZnOH+ coordinated at a fragment with a single Al center (Fig. 2).
During the interaction of ethane with ZnOH+ another type of Zn-
containing species, ZnH+, could be formed and by this reason we
modeled the dehydrogenation reaction also on the active site Z1/
ZnH+. Structures of transition states and intermediates for the
different mechanisms are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and selected
interatomic distances are reported in Table 1. The calculated values

are shown in Table 2. They are calculated with respect to the
corresponding initial state of the reaction: the active center and
ethane molecule. The reported values take into account the gas
products (C2H4, H2 or H2O) released in the previous stages of the
process.
3.1. Ethane dehydrogenation on Zn2+ species at paired Al site
We considered three mechanisms of ethane dehydrogenation
on Zn2+ species coordinated to cluster model with two Al centers,
which are shown in Fig. 3. In this scheme, the initial active center
Z2/Zn2+ is denoted as R (reactant at the left hand side), while the
same center which is recovered at the end of the catalytic process is
denoted P (product at the right hand side). We considered two
ways for ethane activation  via the interaction of both or of one of
the methyl groups with the active center. In the first case, the
synchronous mechanism (denoted as A) occurs via transition state
TSA1 (Fig. 1), in which two H atoms from both methyl groups are
transferred simultaneously as a hydride ion and as a proton to the
Zn2+ and to a basic zeolite O center, respectively. In this stage
ethene molecule is directly formed and leaves the reaction site. The
remaining intermediate IA (Fig. 1) represents heterolytically
dissociated H2 at the active site. The second step of this mechanism
is H2 recombination and desorption from the active site, which
occurs via transition state TSA2 (Fig. 1).
The second way for initial activation of ethane on the active site
is analogous to the mechanisms reported in the earlier studies
[26,27,29] via formation of carbanionic C2H5
 species. It starts with
heterolytic dissociation of the ethane via transition state TSB1
(Fig. 1), where one of the C atoms interacts with Zn2+ and a H atom
from the same methyl group is transferred as a proton to a basic O
center from the zeolite. The resulting intermediate IB (Fig. 1)
represents Zn(C2H5)+ species and a bridging zeolite hydroxyl
group. There are two possibilities for decomposition of this
intermediate: (i) formation in one step of ethene and H2 by H
from the methyl group of ethanide anion and H+ from the bridging
OH group of the zeolite via TSB2 (Fig. 1) (denoted as mechanism B);
or (ii) by b-transfer of a hydride anion from the methyl group to the
zinc center and desorption of ethene via transition state TSC (Fig. 1)
leading to formation of the intermediate IA, which afterwards
releases a molecule H2 via transition state TSA2. The last
mechanism is denoted C.
The first transition state TSA1 of the synchronic mechanism A is
late, i.e. its enthalpy and structure are closer to the intermediate IA
and the produced ethene (Tables 1 and 2). The second transition

state TSA2 of this mechanism concerns recombination of H2 from
the intermediate. The calculated DH values for the two transition
states are similar, 153 and 164 kJ/mol. With DH of 131 kJ/mol, the
intermediate IA is by only 6 kJ/mol more stable than the product
(this difference characterizes the energy gain due to dissociative
adsorption of H2 on the active site Z2/Zn2+).
In the carbanionic mechanism B, the first transition state TSB1,
corresponding to heterolytic dissociation of ethane on the active
site, is also late (Tables 1 and 2). Similarly, the second transition
state in the mechanism B, TSB2, is structurally closer to the final
products of the reaction, ethene and H2 than to the intermediate IB.
Both
TSB1,
with DH = 79 kJ/mol,
and
the
intermediate
IB,
DH = 76 kJ/mol, of the mechanism B are notably more stable than
corresponding species obtained in the synchronous mechanism A.
The relative enthalpy of the second transition state, TSB2,
DH = 154 kJ/mol, is similar to both transition states of the
mechanism A, TS!1 and TS!2.
Mechanism C includes subsequently TSB1, IB, TSC, IA and TSA2.
The only transition state that is not included in the mechanisms A
and B is TSC (for b-transfer), which is considerably less stable,
DH = 272 kJ/mol (Table 2), than the transitions states described
above.
3.2. Ethane dehydrogenation on ZnOH+ species at isolated Al sites
On the alternative catalytic species, ZnOH+, located close to an
isolated Al center, we considered again the same two ways of
activation of C2H6 molecule  via interaction of one or both methyl
groups with the active center (Fig. 4). The main difference from the
previous active site is the absence of additional basic oxygen center
from the zeolite fragment in vicinity of the zinc species which in
the previous case subtracted a proton from ethane. By this reason,
as basic site here we considered the oxygen center from the ZnOH+
species. The first mechanism, denoted as D, includes heterolytic
cleavage of a CH bond towards C2H5
 anion coordinated to the
zinc cation and H+ interacting with the O center from the ZnOH+,
TSD1 (Fig. 2). This reaction step should lead to the intermediate
Zn(C2H5)(H2O)+ coordinated to the zeolite ring, however during
the optimization of this structure the water molecule leaves the
active site and intermediate ID, representing adsorbed Zn(C2H5)+
species (Fig. 2), is formed. Due to the desorption of H2O in the first
step, the catalytic center ZnOH+ can be recovered only in presence
of water in the gas phase. Thus, the interaction of the intermediate
ID with water via transition state TSD2 (Fig. 4) leads to formation of
ethene and H2 and restoration of the catalytic center. In the second
mechanism, denoted as E, the ethane molecule transfers simulta-
neously a proton and a hydride ion to the O and H atoms from the
hydroxyl group of the ZnOH+ species (Fig. 2). In this way via
transition state TSE the products C2H4 and H2 are formed in a single
step and the catalytic center is restored.
In the first transition state of mechanism D, TSD1, the
transferred proton is located close to the zinc cation at ZnH
distance of 178 pm (Table 1). The intermediate ID, Zn(C2H5)+, have
similar structure as the intermediate of the mechanism B, IB; the
only difference is that in ID the species are coordinated to zeolite
ring containing isolated Al center, while in IB, the zeolite fragment
contains two Al centers and Zn(C2H5)+ is located in the middle of
the zeolite ring. In the second transition state TSD2, the molecule
H2 is formed from H+ from the water molecule and H from the
ethanide
anion
without
the
participation
of
Zn2+.
This
is
accompanied by desorption of the formed ethene from the
catalytic site.
The relative enthalpy of the transition state TSD1 is 117 kJ/mol,
but DH of the second transition state TSD2, 215 kJ/mol (Table 2), is
significantly higher than the values for the rate-limiting steps in
the mechanisms A and B described above. To some extend this
could be caused by the lower acidity of the proton donor, H2O
compared to the zeolite OH group in mechanism B, and the higher
stability of the intermediate ID compared to the intermediate IB, by
27 kJ/mol. The latter observation suggests that the ethanide anions
are more stable on zinc species located close to isolated Al centers
than on those coordinated in vicinity of paired Al sites.
The transition state TSE for formation of ethene and hydrogen
via interaction of ethane with the oxygen and hydrogen atoms
from
the
hydroxyl
ligand
of
the
ZnOH+
species
is
rather
unfavorable with DH = 277 kJ/mol (Table 2).
3.3. Ethane dehydrogenation on ZnH+ species at isolated Al sites
We also studied the possibility of formation of alternative
catalytic center ZnH+ (Fig. 5) from Z1/ZnOH+. Such center can be
obtained when ethane interacts with Z1/ZnOH+ in absence of
water. It also can be formed in presence of partially compensated
zinc ions, located close to isolated Al centers in the zeolite lattice,
since such Zn species is formed mainly when H-ZSM-5 is treated
with Zn vapor at high temperature [1013].

3.4. Formation of the active center ZnH+
The formation of ZnH+ was modeled again by interaction of
ethane with Z1/ZnOH+ in two ways (Fig. 5). The first one
(denoted as X) includes the same first stage as the mechanism D,
where via transition state TSD1 the intermediate Z1/Zn(C2H5)+,
ID (Fig. 2), is formed. Then, after abstraction of ethene molecule
(in absence of water) via transition state TSX2 the new active
center Z1/ZnH+ (Fig. 2) is obtained. In the second mechanism
(denoted as Y) two of the hydrogen atoms of ethane located at
different C atoms interact respectively with the basic O center of
ZnOH+ and with Zn2+ ion. Hence via transition state TSY (Fig. 2)
simultaneously ethene and water are released and the catalytic
center Z1/ZnH+ is formed. Since Zn2+ species is unlikely to
coordinate more than one ligand [21] (in addition to the zeolite
fragment), the expected intermediates Z1/Zn(C2H5)(H2O)+ and
Z1/Zn(H)(H2O)+ were not found due to spontaneous desorption
of the water molecule.
The transition state of the first stage of mechanism X has low
relative enthalpy, 117 kJ/mol, while the enthalpy of the second
transition state TSX2 is significant, 254 kJ/mol (Table 2). The
geometric characteristics of TSX2 are close to those of the similar
transition state TSC (Table 1). The only significant difference is the
location of Zn(C2H5)+ moiety in TSX2 close to the single Al center,
while in TSC it is located in the middle of the cluster.
The relative enthalpy of the transition state TSY is 211 kJ/mol
(Table 2), i.e. significantly higher than the enthalpy of the first
transition state in the mechanism X, TSD1, however with 43 kJ/mol
lower than the enthalpy of the second transition state, TSX2.
3.5. Ethane dehydrogenation on ZnH+ species
The interaction of ethane with ZnH+ again is modeled via one or
both methyl groups (Fig. 6). In the first case (mechanism F)
heterolytic dissociation of CH bond occurs as C atom binds to Zn2+
ion, while H atom interacts with the hydride anion H from ZnH+,
TSF1 (Fig. 2), resulting in formation of H2 molecule and the
intermediate ID (Fig. 2). The catalytic center ZnH+ recovers after b-
transfer of H from the methyl group and desorption of ethene via
transition state TSX2. In the other considered mechanism, denoted
as G, the ethane molecule interacts with ZnH+ by two of the H
atoms of different CH3 groups via TSG (Fig. 2) and in one step C2H4
and H2 are formed.
The calculated enthalpies of all transition states in mechanisms
F and G are high, 221, 246, and 233 kJ/mol for TSF1, TSX2, and TSG,
respectively.

First we discuss the mechanisms of ethane dehydrogenation on
the zinc species (ZnOH+ and ZnH+) located at isolated Al centers
and the species (Zn2+) at paired Al sites on the base of comparison
between calculated relative enthalpy values for the obtained
transition states with respect to corresponding reactants.
From the calculated DH of the transitions states on Zn2+
coordinated at paired Al centers we can conclude, that energeti-
cally the most favorable is the carbanionic mechanism B, where DH
of the transition states are the lowest: 79 and 154 kJ/mol, while for
the mechanism A they are 153 and 164 kJ/mol. For both
mechanisms the second stages are rate-limiting. However, it
should be noted that the enthalpy difference between the
transition states of the two rate-limiting steps is only 9 kJ/mol.
The intermediate formed during the mechanism B, Zn(C2H5)+, is
also more stable than the corresponding intermediate of mecha-
nism A, ZnH+.
The enthalpies of all rate-limited transition states of the
mechanisms on ZnOH+ and ZnH+ located at isolated Al centers (D
G) are above 200 kJ/mol (Table 2). Hence, we can conclude that the
reaction of ethane dehydrogenation occurs much easier on Zn2+
species located close to paired Al centers, since the energies of the
transition states in mechanisms A and B are significantly lower. It
should be noted that the enthalpy of the transition state TSD1 is
relatively
low,
117 kJ/mol,
which
supposes
that
interaction
between ethane and Z1/ZnOH+ leading to formation of the
complex Z1/Zn(C2H5)+ (denoted ID) can occur. The DH value of
the obtained complex Z1/Zn(C2H5)+, located at isolated Al center, is
by 27 kJ/mol lower than the value of the corresponding complex
Z2/H+,Zn(C2H5)+ located at two Al centers, intermediate IB. This
suggests that the ethane molecule can undergo heterolytic
dissociation on partially compensated zinc ions in vicinity of
isolated Al center leading to formation of the complex Zn(C2H5)+.
However, ethene cannot be produced from this complex due to
the high energy barrier for intramolecular hydride transfer from
the methyl group to zinc ion via the second transition state of the
mechanisms D or X, TSD2 or TSX2. The abstraction of a hydride ion
in the complex Z1/Zn(C2H5)+ cannot occur as intermolecular (as
in mechanism B) since a neighboring zeolite OH group is absent
due to the lack of second Al center in vicinity of the cation.
The intermolecular process is more favorable compared to the
intramolecular as one can estimate from the enthalpies of the
corresponding transition states on zinc species at paired Al sites,
TS%2, and TSC, 154 and 272 kJ/mol.
Theoretical investigation of other authors on the mechanism of
ethane dehydrogenation on protonic form of H-ZSM-5 zeolite
shows that the relative energy of the highest transition state is
288311 kJ/mol [3840], depending on the method and the size of
the zeolite fragment. Hence, one can easily estimate that addition
of Zn species in the zeolite system decreases significantly the
energy of the highest transition state of alkane dehydrogenation,
by more than 100 kJ/mol.
4.1.2. Gibbs free energy (influence of the entropy on the reaction
mechanisms)
Since the process of ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5
zeolites occurs at high temperature, 723823 K, [1,3,7,32] the
entropy can influence significantly the preferred reaction path. By
this reason we calculated Gibbs free energy of all transition states
and intermediates for the considered mechanisms on the three
different types of Zn species.

included in the mechanisms of dehydrogenation on Zn2+ at paired Al site: AC
(upper panel); on ZnOH+ at isolated Al site, D, E, X and Y (middle panel); as well as
on ZnH+ at isolated Al site, G and F (lower panel).

The values of DS shown in Table 2 include the contributions of
all degrees of freedom for molecules in the gas phase and only
vibrational degrees of freedom for the complexes in the zeolite
cluster. The enthalpy and the entropy of the transition states are
calculated with respect to the reactants for the corresponding
mechanism. The variations of the Gibbs free energy of the
corresponding transition states as function of temperature for
the mechanisms AC on Z2/Zn2+ catalytic center are displayed in
the upper panel of Fig. 7. In all cases the entropy of the initial state,
Z2/Zn2+ and ethane, is higher than the entropy of the transition
states, and by this reason DG of the transition states increases with
increasing the temperature. According to DG values, at tempera-
ture close to the experimental (T = 800 K) the rate-limiting stages
on mechanisms A and B are the initial stage A1 and second stage
B2, respectively. The entropy at T = 298 K of these transition states,
TSA1 and TSB2, is significant 145 and 152 J/mol K (Table 2), and
decrease slightly by 20 J/mol K with increasing the temperature
to 800 K to: 124 and 132 J/mol K. Due to the significant values
of the entropy with increasing the temperature, the Gibbs free
energy of TSA1 and TSB2 increases fast (Fig. 7). At 800 K, TSB2 has
higher Gibbs free energy, 260 kJ/mol, than TSA1, 252 kJ/mol, i.e. the
mechanism A is favorable when we take into account the entropy
contribution to the process. However, the energy difference at
800 K between these transition states is only 8 kJ/mol, i.e. the
reaction rate of mechanism A is about three times higher than that
of mechanism B. On the other hand, it should be noted that the
value 8 kJ/mol is close to the limit of the accuracy of the
computational method, which indicates that the reaction might
occur concurrently by both mechanisms.
It is interesting that the stage with the highest entropy from
both
mechanisms
is
the
recombination
and
desorption
of
hydrogen via TSA2 with only 8 J/mol K at T = 298 K (Table 2)
(the entropy slightly decreases as an absolute value to 5 J/mol K
at T = 800 K), and by this reason this transition state has notably
lower DG at high temperatures (170 kJ/mol at 800 K) than the
other considered transition states. This result is in agreement with
the suggestion of Biscardi et al. [13] based of their experimental
investigations, that the catalytic role of Zn species in Zn,H-ZSM-5
zeolite during the alkane dehydrogenation is participation in the
recombination and desorption of H2, which is exactly the second
stage of the mechanism A.
Similar analysis with accounting for the entropy is done also for
the mechanisms of alkane dehydrogenation on the other two
active centers, where zinc species are located in the vicinity of an
isolated Al center. The variations of DG of the transition states for
the mechanisms on Z1/ZnOH+ (mechanisms D, E, X and Y) and on
Z1/ZnH+ (mechanisms F and G), as a function of temperature are
displayed on the middle and lower panels of Fig. 7, respectively.
The only stages which can concur with processes on the bare Zn2+
ions located at paired Al sites are TSD1 and TSX2 (283 and 278 kJ/
mol at 800 K) leading to formation of Z1/Zn(C2H5)+ or Z1/ZnH+
complexes. However, the values of DG for continuation of the
reaction on both types of intermediate complexes are by at least
100 kJ/mol higher. Thus, similarly to the conclusion based on the
enthalpy values, the variation of the DG values again suggests that
the interaction of ethane with ZnOH+ or ZnH+ species at isolated Al
sites leads to formation of the intermediate Z1/Zn(C2H5)+. In
addition, from this intermediate via transition state TSX2 Z1/ZnH+
species could be formed. However, these two intermediate Zn
species block the catalytic centers since the Gibbs free energies for
the next reaction steps are too high.
Hence, taking into account the entropy of the system, the DG of
the rate-limiting transition states of all mechanisms DG are
significant, above 350 kJ/mol, which is by more than 80 kJ/mol
larger than the corresponding values for the mechanisms A and B
of ethane dehydrogenation on Zn2+ at paired Al sites. This suggests
that reaction of ethane dehydrogenation on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite
occurs (by more than 5 orders of magnitude) faster on Zn2+ ions
located in the vicinity of two Al centers than on Zn-containing
species close to isolated Al center, since on latter centers the
interaction with ethane leads to formation of stable spectator
species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+, which can hardly be converted into
reaction products.
One can also use the estimated DG values to speculate which
intermediates are expected to be observed on different zinc species
comparing the DG values of the transition states for their formation
and conversion into products. On Zn2+ species at paired Al site the
DG for formation of the intermediate IA (Z2/ZnH+) is always higher
(above 200 K) than the corresponding value for its conversion. The
difference between the two transition states at 800 K reaches
100 kJ/mol, i.e. the rate for formation of the intermediate is about
107 times slower than its decomposition, which suggests that
intermediate ZnH+ species at paired Al sites cannot be observed
experimentally during ethane dehydrogenation. On the other
hand, DG value for formation of the other intermediate IB, Z2/
Zn(C2H5)+, is always lower than the values for its decomposition
and this difference is highest at lower temperature. The expected
ratio of the rates of the stages B1/B2 (based on the calculated DG
values) is of the orders 103 and 104 at 800 and 500 K, respectively,
i.e. Zn(C2H5)+ species can be observed experimentally during the
process at paired Al sites.
When the Zn species are close to isolated Al sites the DG value
for formation of the intermediate ID, Z1/Zn(C2H5)+, is by about
100 kJ/mol (at 800 K) lower than the value for its decomposition to
products
via
reaction
path
D.
Z1/Zn(C2H5)+
could
be
also
transformed to ZnH+ species via transition state TSX2, due to the
similar DG values of the steps D1 and X2. This suggests that both
types of species Zn(C2H5)+ and ZnH+ can be observed on isolated Al
sites.
4.2. Comparison with previous experimental and theoretical studies
The formation of stable species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ on zinc
species close to isolated Al center is in good agreement with
experimental study of Kazansky and Pidko [12]. They established
ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ species after reactive adsorption of H2 or ethane,
respectively, on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites, obtained by exchange of H-
ZSM-5 zeolite with Zn vapors that presumably contain partially
compensated Zn2+ cations. For Zn(C2H5)+ they detected several
characteristic IR bands at 2874, 2910, 2958 and a shoulder about
2980 cm1 (see Fig. 6 in Ref. [12]), which were assigned to the CH
stretching modes. Indeed, we calculated similar values of the CH
frequencies in the intermediate ID representing the structure Z1/
Zn(C2H5)+: 2880, 2905, 2942, 2948 and 2979 cm1 (see note [41]).
However, the CH frequencies of the same species located in
vicinity of paired Al cites as in the intermediate IB: 2877, 2913,
2941, 2952 and 2975 cm1, are also in good agreement with the
experimental values. In the experiment, above 500 K the Zn(C2H5)+
species are transformed into ZnH+ species characterized by an IR
vibrational frequency of 1934 cm1 [10,42].
Stable Zn(CH3)+ species were also detected recently by MAS
NMR [14] when methane is adsorbed on Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites,
obtained by exchange of H-ZSM-5 zeolite with Zn vapors. The
experiments showed that Zn(CH3)+ species can be observed at
ambient temperature only on Zn species close to isolated Al
centers, while on Zn2+ close to Al pairs such species are not
detected. This conclusion is in agreement with the higher stability
of the ZnR+ species at isolated than at the paired Al sites obtained in
the present work. Along the line of our discussion for ethane
dissociation on zinc sites, methane dissociation on Zn2+ at paired Al
sites results in formation of Zn(CH3)+ and a neighboring bridging
OH group that allows easy recombination and desorption of

methane. On the other hand, on zinc species at isolated Al centers
methane dissociation creates a distant OH group at the second Al
center
(that
formally
balances
the
charge
of
the
partially
compensated Zn2+ ion in the sample). By this reason the
recombination of methane is rather difficult and Zn(CH3)+ species
have long live-time, sufficient to be detected by MAS NMR
measurement.
As it was mentioned in the Introduction, the mechanisms B and
C, occurring via carbanionic intermediate IB, have been already
modeled computationally in several studies using density func-
tional method with B3LYP functional [2629]. The former study
[26] was based on four-membered zeolite ring models, while the
latter ones on 2 five-membered rings [2729]. The geometrical
parameters of most of the structures, obtained in present study and
in Refs. [2729], are similar. The deviations are within 5 pm at
most although different zeolite models are used. The only
exception is TSB2 structure, where the OzH distance in our
structure, 157 pm, is larger by 13 pm than the distance in the
structure obtained in Ref. [29], 145 pm. The calculated energy
values reported by Pidko and van Santen [29] are by 42, 30, and
71 kJ/mol higher for the transition states TSA2, TSB1, and TSB2 with
respect to the corresponding values obtained in our study. In the
latter case the larger energy difference could be related to the
different models, more flexible basis set used in the present study
(6-311+G** here versus combination of 6-31G**, 6-311G**, and
D95 in Ref. [29]) and the larger elongation of the OH distance
mentioned above. On the other hand, the calculated energy for the
TSC reported by Pidko and van Santen [29], 262 kJ/mol, is lower by
10 kJ/mol than the result in the present study, 272 kJ/mol.
Summarizing the results of the previous theoretical and
experimental studies one can conclude that depending on the
preparation technique of Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites, different Zn species
could be formed and could act as catalysts for the alkane
dehydrogenation.
When Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites is prepared by ion exchange from
water solution of zinc salt [2] two types of Zn species should exist
in the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite: ZnOH+ at isolated Al center and at
two closely located Al centers (e.g. Al pair)  Zn2+, formed from
Zn(H2O)2+ after desorption of water at high temperature. Our
present calculations showed that ethane dehydrogenation can
occur significantly easier on the latter species.
When Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolites is prepared by exchange of H-ZSM-5
zeolite with Zn vapors two types of Zn2+ cations are suggested to
exist: (1) Zn2+ in vicinity of isolated Al center and (2) Zn2+ in
vicinity of two Al centers. According to the calculations of Pidko
and van Santen [29], who modeled the mechanisms denoted here
as B and C on both types of Zn2+ ions (located close to one or two Al
centers), the dehydrogenation reaction would occur with lowest
activation barrier on Zn2+ located close to only one Al center via
mechanism B with the apparent activation energy of only 153 kJ/
mol and an energy barrier of the rate-limiting reaction step B2 of
147 kJ/mol. Due to the lack of second Al center in the ring with the
Zn2+ cation, the intermediate, formed along this reaction pathway,
contains Zn(C2H5)+ species and SiO(H)Si hydroxyl group, while
the second Al center in the neighboring five-membered ring
remains uncompensated. According to Shubin et al. [28], the
proton from SiO(H)Si hydroxyl group could easily migrate
towards the distant Al center (with a reaction barrier of only 59 kJ/
mol) that will result in the most stable intermediate with a distant
AlO(H)Si group. Since in the obtained structure both Al centers
are charge compensated, this intermediate is more stable by
129 kJ/mol than initial structure with SiO(H)Si fragment [28], i.e.
the proton can hardly be returned back to the SiO(H)Si bridge
due to the high energy barrier for the reverse transfer, 188 kJ/mol
[28]. By this reason, on Zn2+ species at isolated Al sites the
dehydrogenation reaction would stop since the OH group in
vicinity of the Zn(C2H5)+ species is not available, in complete
agreement with the conclusions from our model calculations.
When Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite is prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation, in addition to the Zn2+ and ZnOH+, external ZnO
crystallites [2], as well as ZnOZn2+ species could exist [1519].
Pidko and van Santen [29] modeled dehydrogenation on ZnOZn2+
and showed that heterolytic C2H6 dissociation results in formation
of very stable species: ZnOH+ and Zn(C2H5)+, and according to the
authors,
formation
of
ethene
afterwards
is
kinetically
and
thermodynamically unfavored. However, Stepanov et al. [17]
proposed another mechanism of dehydrogenation which includes
simultaneously not only ZnOZn2+ but also zeolite acidic site Si
OHAl and supposed synergism between Zn species and a
neighboring bridging OH group of the zeolite.
5. Conclusions
Our computational model study of the ethane dehydrogenation
on the active sites in Zn,H-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by ion exchange
suggests that the reaction occurs faster on Zn2+ ions located in the
vicinity of two Al centers, while on Zn species close to isolated Al
center, stable spectator species ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ are formed.
However, further catalytic reaction on these species does not occur
due to the high energetic barriers on the next stages of the
dehydrogenation process. This conclusion highlights the crucial
role of the second Al center in vicinity of the zinc ion for ethane
dehydrogenation:
- in synchronic mechanism A the presence of second Al center
ensure basic O center at appropriate distance, which can interact
with one of the H atoms of the ethane;
- in the dissociative mechanism B, the second Al center ensure not
only basic O center for initial cleavage of CH bond, but also
bridging OH group, which interacts with ethanide anion in the
second stage.
On the catalytic centers Zn2+, the reaction occurs concurrently on
both A and B mechanisms with rate-limiting stages, respectively: A1 
synchronic abstraction of H and H+ from the ethane, and B2 
abstraction of a H from the ethanide anion and formation of the
reaction products.
