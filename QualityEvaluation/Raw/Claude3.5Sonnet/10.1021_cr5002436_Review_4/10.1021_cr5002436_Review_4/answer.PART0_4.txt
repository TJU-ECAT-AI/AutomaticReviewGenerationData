[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."

[3] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. These materials include coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, carbon nanofibers (CNFs), hybrid nanocarbons with diamond cores and graphitic shells, and carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems.

The proposed mechanisms for this catalytic activity vary depending on the specific carbon material:

1. For coke deposits and CNFs, the formation of radicals on the carbon surface is believed to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. In hybrid nanocarbons, the activity is attributed to either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material.

3. For carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems, oxygen-containing groups (CO) are proposed as the active sites.

Temperature plays a crucial role in influencing the catalytic activity of these carbon-based materials. For instance, the highest activity for coke deposits was observed at 700°C, where the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure. However, elevated temperatures can also lead to increased noncatalytic conversion of alkanes and potentially decrease selectivity due to cracking reactions.

Surface chemistry is another important factor. The presence of specific functional groups, such as oxygen-containing groups in mesoporous carbon systems, can significantly enhance catalytic activity. These groups can be introduced through pretreatment steps, such as nitric acid treatment.

The discovery of catalytic activity in carbon-based materials has important implications for the development of novel and efficient catalysts. These materials offer several advantages, including high surface area, low cost, and environmental friendliness. The ability to tune the surface chemistry and structure of carbon-based materials provides opportunities for designing tailored catalysts for specific dehydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, the stability of some carbon-based catalysts, such as the mesoporous systems reported by Liu et al., suggests potential for long-term industrial applications.

This phenomenon challenges the traditional view of carbon deposits as solely detrimental to catalyst performance and opens up new avenues for research in carbon-based catalysis for alkane dehydrogenation and potentially other reactions.

各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性。这些材料包括VOx/Al2O3催化剂上的积碳沉积物、碳纳米纤维（CNFs）、具有金刚石核心和石墨壳的混合纳米碳，以及碳基有序介孔系统。

根据特定的碳材料，提出了不同的催化活性机理：

1. 对于积碳沉积物和CNFs，认为在碳表面形成的自由基促进了脱氢反应。

2. 在混合纳米碳中，活性被归因于酮基或石墨材料中的结构缺陷。

3. 对于碳基有序介孔系统，含氧基团（CO）被提议为活性位点。

温度在影响这些碳基材料的催化活性中起着至关重要的作用。例如，在700°C时观察到积碳沉积物的最高活性，此时碳沉积物呈现出高度有序的结构。然而，较高的温度也可能导致烷烃非催化转化的增加，并可能由于裂解反应而降低选择性。

表面化学是另一个重要因素。特定官能团的存在，如介孔碳系统中的含氧基团，可显著提高催化活性。这些基团可以通过预处理步骤引入，例如硝酸处理。

碳基材料催化活性的发现对开发新型高效催化剂具有重要意义。这些材料具有多种优势，包括高比表面积、低成本和环境友好性。调节碳基材料的表面化学和结构的能力为设计特定脱氢反应的定制催化剂提供了机会。此外，一些碳基催化剂的稳定性，如Liu等人报道的介孔系统，表明它们具有长期工业应用的潜力。

这一现象挑战了传统观点，即认为碳沉积物仅对催化剂性能有害，并为烷烃脱氢和潜在的其他反应的碳基催化研究开辟了新途径。
