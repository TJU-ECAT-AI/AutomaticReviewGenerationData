[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."

[3] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

Carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through various mechanisms:

1. Coke deposits: Radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate dehydrogenation reactions, particularly at elevated temperatures.

2. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs): These materials are catalytically active, likely through a similar mechanism as coke deposits.

3. Hybrid nanocarbons: A diamond core with a graphitic shell shows activity, attributed to ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material.

4. Ordered mesoporous carbon systems: Oxygen-containing groups (CO) act as active sites, formed during pretreatment with nitric acid.

Influencing factors include:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures increase activity but may also lead to undesired side reactions like cracking.
2. Surface chemistry: The presence of specific functional groups (e.g., ketones, CO groups) or structural defects enhances catalytic activity.
3. Pretreatment: Acid treatment can create active sites on carbon surfaces.

This phenomenon has significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts:

1. Cost-effective alternatives: Carbon materials are inexpensive and environmentally friendly compared to traditional metal catalysts.
2. Tunable properties: The ability to modify surface chemistry and structure allows for tailoring catalysts to specific reactions.
3. Long-term stability: Some carbon-based catalysts show remarkable stability over extended periods.
4. New catalyst designs: Understanding the active sites in carbon materials can lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts.

These findings challenge conventional wisdom about coke formation in catalysis and open new avenues for research into carbon-based catalytic materials.

碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，其机理包括：

1. 焦炭沉积物：焦炭表面形成的自由基促进脱氢反应，特别是在高温下。

2. 碳纳米纤维（CNFs）：这些材料具有催化活性，可能与焦炭沉积物的机理相似。

3. 混合纳米碳：具有金刚石核心和石墨壳的结构显示出活性，这归因于石墨材料中的酮基或结构缺陷。

4. 有序介孔碳系统：氧含量基团（CO）作为活性位点，在硝酸预处理过程中形成。

影响因素包括：

1. 温度：更高的温度会增加活性，但也可能导致裂解等不良副反应。
2. 表面化学：特定官能团（如酮基、CO基团）或结构缺陷的存在会增强催化活性。
3. 预处理：酸处理可以在碳表面创造活性位点。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂具有重要意义：

1. 具有成本效益的替代品：与传统金属催化剂相比，碳材料廉价且环保。
