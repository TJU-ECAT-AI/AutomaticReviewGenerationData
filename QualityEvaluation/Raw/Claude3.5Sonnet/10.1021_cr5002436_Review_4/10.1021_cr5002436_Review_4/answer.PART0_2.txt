[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."

[3] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Interestingly, the latter was not the case in the work of McGregor et al., who reported a selectivity toward butenes of 80%."

[5] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[6] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants."

[7] "The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

[8] "The catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability, displaying conversion and selectivity values of 45% and 85%, respectively, after 100 h of time on stream at 600 C."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions through several mechanisms:

1. Coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts: These deposits, rather than deactivating the catalyst, actually catalyze butane dehydrogenation. The proposed mechanism involves radicals formed on the coke surface facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs): These materials show catalytic activity in butane dehydrogenation, likely through a similar radical-based mechanism as coke deposits.

3. Hybrid nanocarbons: Composed of a diamond core and graphitic shell, these materials are active in propane dehydrogenation. The activity is attributed to either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material.

4. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems: These catalysts are active in propane dehydrogenation without steam or oxidants. The proposed active sites are oxygen-containing groups (CO) formed during a nitric acid pretreatment.

Temperature plays a crucial role in the activity and selectivity of these carbon-based catalysts. Higher temperatures generally increase activity but may lead to a decrease in selectivity due to cracking reactions. However, in some cases, such as the work by McGregor et al., high selectivity (80% towards butenes) was maintained even at elevated temperatures.

Surface chemistry is another critical factor. The presence of oxygen-containing groups, structural defects, or specific functional groups (like ketones) on the carbon surface can significantly influence catalytic activity and selectivity.

The implications of this phenomenon for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts are significant:

1. Cost-effective alternatives: Carbon-based catalysts could provide cheaper alternatives to traditional metal-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Environmentally friendly options: These materials are generally more environmentally friendly than metal-based catalysts.

3. Improved stability: Some carbon-based catalysts, like the mesoporous systems, show remarkable long-term stability, maintaining high conversion and selectivity over extended periods.

4. New catalyst design strategies: Understanding the role of surface chemistry and structure in carbon-based catalysts can lead to the development of tailored materials with optimized performance for specific reactions.

These findings open up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

各种碳基材料在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出意外的催化活性，通过以下几种机制：

1. VOx/Al2O3催化剂上的积炭沉积物：这些沉积物不仅不会使催化剂失活，反而催化丁烷脱氢。提出的机制涉及在积炭表面形成的自由基促进脱氢反应。

2. 碳纳米纤维（CNFs）：这些材料在丁烷脱氢中表现出催化活性，可能通过与积炭沉积物类似的基于自由基的机制。

3. 混合纳米碳：由金刚石核心和石墨壳组成，这些材料在丙烷脱氢中表现活性。活性归因于石墨材料中的酮基或结构缺陷。

4. 碳基有序介孔系统：这些催化剂在没有蒸汽或氧化剂的情况下对丙烷脱氢表现活性。提出的活性位点是在硝酸预处理过程中形成的含氧基团（CO）。

温度在这些碳基催化剂的活性和选择性中起着关键作用。较高的温度通常会增加活性，但可能导致选择性下降，因为会发生裂解反应。然而，在某些情况下，如McGregor等人的工作中，即使在高温下也保持了高选择性（80%朝向丁烯）。

表面化学是另一个关键因素。碳表面含氧基团、结构缺陷或特定官能团（如酮）的存在可以显著影响催化活性和选择性。

这一现象对开发新型高效碳基催化剂的影响是重大的：

1. 成本效益高的替代品：碳基催化剂可以为脱氢反应提供比传统金属基催化剂更便宜的替代品。

2. 环境友好选择：这些材料通常比金属基催化剂更环保。

3. 改善稳定性：一些碳基催化剂，如介孔系统，表现出显著的长期稳定性，在延长的时间内保持高转化率和选择性。

4. 新的催化剂设计策略：了解碳基催化剂中表面化学和结构的作用可以导致开发针对特定反应优化性能的定制材料。

这些发现为烷烃脱氢反应的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的途径，有可能导致更高效和可持续的工业过程。
