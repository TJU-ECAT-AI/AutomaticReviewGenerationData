[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction."

[3] "It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Interestingly, the latter was not the case in the work of McGregor et al., who reported a selectivity toward butenes of 80%."

[5] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[6] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants."

[7] "The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Coke deposits: McGregor et al. found that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst encapsulated by coke remained active in butane dehydrogenation. The carbon species on the catalyst surface were hypothesized to catalyze the reaction.

2. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs): These proved to be catalytically active, with radicals formed on the coke surface facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction at elevated temperatures.

3. Hybrid nanocarbons: A material with a diamond core and graphitic shell showed activity in propane dehydrogenation, attributed to ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material.

4. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems: Liu et al. developed these systems, which were active in propane dehydrogenation without steam or oxidants.

Proposed mechanisms and influencing factors:

1. Radical formation: Radicals on the coke surface are believed to facilitate dehydrogenation, especially at higher temperatures.

2. Surface chemistry: Oxygen-containing groups (CO) formed during pretreatment with nitric acid are proposed as active sites in mesoporous carbon systems.

3. Temperature: Higher temperatures increase activity but may also lead to undesired side reactions like cracking.

4. Structural features: Ketone groups and structural defects in graphitic materials contribute to catalytic activity.

Implications for catalyst development:

1. Carbon-based catalysts offer a potentially inexpensive and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional metal-based catalysts.

2. The unexpected activity of coke deposits suggests that carbon formation during reactions may not always be detrimental and could be harnessed for catalytic purposes.

3. The ability to tune surface chemistry and structural features of carbon materials provides opportunities for developing highly selective and stable catalysts.

4. Carbon-based catalysts show promise for operating without steam or oxidants, potentially simplifying reactor designs and improving process efficiency.

These findings open up new avenues for developing novel, efficient carbon-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, potentially revolutionizing industrial processes in this field.
