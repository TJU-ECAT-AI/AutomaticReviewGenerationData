[1] "McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation."

[2] "The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure."

[3] "Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high."

[4] "Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material."

[5] "Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid."

Various carbon-based materials exhibit unexpected catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Coke deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts show activity in butane dehydrogenation, with the highest activity observed at 700°C when the carbon deposits have a very ordered structure.

2. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are catalytically active, with radicals formed on the coke surface facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Hybrid nanocarbons with a diamond core and graphitic shell display activity in propane dehydrogenation.

4. Carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems show activity in propane dehydrogenation without steam or oxidants.

The proposed mechanisms and influencing factors include:

1. Radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction.
2. Temperature plays a crucial role, with higher temperatures leading to increased activity but potentially decreased selectivity due to cracking reactions.
3. Surface chemistry is important, with oxygen-containing groups (CO) acting as active sites in some carbon-based catalysts.
4. Structural features such as ketone groups or defects in graphitic material contribute to catalytic activity.

These findings have significant implications for developing novel and efficient carbon-based catalysts:

1. Carbon materials can potentially replace or complement traditional metal-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The ability to tune surface chemistry and structure of carbon materials offers opportunities for optimizing catalyst performance.
3. Carbon-based catalysts may provide more environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives to conventional catalysts.
4. Understanding the role of carbon in catalysis can lead to the development of hybrid catalysts that combine the benefits of carbon and metal-based systems.
