Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be about a tungsten-based olefin metathesis catalyst supported on silica. There is no mention of zirconium, thorium, C-H activation, H/D exchange, or alkane metathesis. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these materials or discuss their mechanisms in the specified reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中不包含任何关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物、氧化铝负载的钍氢化物或它们在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质的信息。这篇文章似乎是关于一种硅胶负载的钨基烯烃复分解催化剂。文中没有提到锆、钍、C-H活化、H/D交换或烷烃复分解。由于在提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法比较和对比这些材料的制备、结构和催化性质，也无法讨论它们在指定反应中的机理。

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be a title and author list for a scientific article about a tungsten imido alkylidene olefin metathesis catalyst supported on silica. There is no content related to the specific question asked about zirconium and thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be a bibliographic entry for a scientific article about a tungsten-based olefin metathesis catalyst supported on silica. It does not provide any details about the preparation, structure, or catalytic mechanisms of zirconium or thorium hydrides. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or discussion of their properties and mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions based on this literature.
