Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, or catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document does not discuss H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, or related mechanisms like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The text focuses on other types of catalysts and reactions for light alkane oxidation, but does not cover the specific systems and processes mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the given literature.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, or catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document also does not discuss H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, or related mechanisms like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The text primarily focuses on the oxidation of light alkanes using various metal oxide catalysts and does not cover the specific hydride catalysts or reactions mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided information.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document focuses on the oxidation of light alkanes using various metal oxide catalysts and does not discuss C-H bond activation reactions involving metal hydrides. There is no mention of H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes. As such, I cannot provide a comparison of the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these specific metal hydride catalysts or detail their mechanisms in the requested reactions based on the information given in this document.
