[1] "Complex (4) is the only doubly metallated isomer formed, presumably for steric reasons."

[2] "For R = H rather than CH3, reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6."

[3] "Organo-lanthanide complexes containing the CH2SiMe3 ligand have been prepared,9,10 however, by metathetical routes."

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to answer the question about silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The text primarily discusses lutetium complexes and their C-H activation reactions. It does not provide details on zirconium or thorium hydrides supported on silica or alumina, nor does it discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. The literature also lacks information on reaction rates, selectivity, and the specific roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

The only somewhat relevant information is that a lutetium hydride complex catalyzes H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6, but this is not directly related to the zirconium and thorium systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be provided based solely on the given literature.

给定的文献没有足够的信息来回答关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的问题。该文本主要讨论了镥络合物及其C-H活化反应。它没有提供关于硅胶或氧化铝负载的锆或钍氢化物的详细信息，也没有讨论它们在H/D交换或烷烃复分解中的机理。文献也缺乏关于反应速率、选择性以及σ键复分解、氢解和链行走在这些过程中的具体作用的信息。

唯一稍微相关的信息是镥氢化物络合物可以催化四甲基硅烷与D2或C6D6之间的H/D交换，但这与问题中提到的锆和钍系统没有直接关系。因此，仅基于给定的文献无法提供对该问题的全面回答。
