[1] "For R = H rather than CH3, reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6."

[2] "Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 °C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (1 equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield"

[3] "Organo-lanthanide complexes containing the CH2SiMe3 ligand have been prepared,9,10 however, by metathetical routes."

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to directly answer the question about silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document focuses on lutetium complexes and their C-H activation properties, not on zirconium or thorium hydrides.

The literature does mention some relevant information about C-H activation and H/D exchange reactions involving organometallic complexes:

1. A lutetium hydride complex catalyzes H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6.

2. Intermolecular C-H activation of tetramethylsilane occurs with a lutetium methyl complex at 40 °C, resulting in metallation and methane elimination.

3. The document notes that organolanthanide complexes containing the CH2SiMe3 ligand have been prepared by metathetical routes, rather than through C-H activation.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or detailed mechanisms for σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes. It also does not discuss silica or alumina supports or compare zirconium and thorium hydrides.

给定的文献没有足够的信息来直接回答关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的问题。该文档主要关注镥络合物及其C-H活化性质，而非锆或钍氢化物。

文献确实提到了一些关于涉及有机金属络合物的C-H活化和H/D交换反应的相关信息：

1. 一种镥氢化物络合物催化四甲基硅烷与D2或C6D6之间的H/D交换。

2. 镥甲基络合物在40°C下与四甲基硅烷发生分子间C-H活化，导致金属化和甲烷消除。

3. 文档指出，含有CH2SiMe3配体的有机镧系络合物是通过复分解路线制备的，而不是通过C-H活化。

然而，该文献没有提供关于反应速率、选择性或σ键复分解、氢解或链行走过程的详细机理的具体信息。它也没有讨论硅胶或氧化铝载体，或比较锆和钍氢化物。
