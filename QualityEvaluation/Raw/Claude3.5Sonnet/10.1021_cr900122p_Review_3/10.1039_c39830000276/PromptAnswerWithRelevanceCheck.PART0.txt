[1] "For R = H rather than CH3, reaction (viii) is readily reversible and the hydride (2) is thus a catalyst for the H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6."

[2] "Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 °C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (1 equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield"

[3] "Other examples of such ready intermolecular activation of tetramethylsilane are uncommon."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain specific information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It primarily discusses lutetium complexes and their C-H activation properties. The document does not provide enough relevant information to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of the specified compounds in C-H bond activation reactions.

However, the literature does mention some general principles of C-H activation that may be relevant:

1. Lutetium hydride complexes can catalyze H/D exchange reactions, as demonstrated with tetramethylsilane.

2. C-H activation is observed for both lanthanide alkyls and hydrides, suggesting it may be a general phenomenon for these types of complexes.

3. The reactions can be selective, yielding high amounts of a single product.

4. Intermolecular activation of tetramethylsilane is described as uncommon, highlighting the unique reactivity of the lutetium complexes discussed.

5. The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking mechanisms for the compounds in question.

Given the limited information provided in the literature about zirconium and thorium hydrides, a comprehensive comparison of their properties and mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions cannot be made based solely on this document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的具体信息。它主要讨论了镥络合物及其C-H活化特性。该文档没有提供足够的相关信息来比较和对比所指定化合物在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性质。

然而，文献确实提到了一些可能相关的C-H活化的一般原理：

1. 镥氢化物络合物可以催化H/D交换反应，如四甲基硅烷的实验所示。

2. C-H活化在镧系烷基和氢化物中都被观察到，这表明它可能是这些类型络合物的一般现象。

3. 这些反应可以是选择性的，产生高产量的单一产物。

4. 四甲基硅烷的分子间活化被描述为罕见，突出了所讨论的镥络合物的独特反应性。

5. 文献没有提供有关所述化合物在C-H键活化反应中的反应速率、σ键复分解、氢解或链行走机制的具体信息。

鉴于文献中关于锆和钍氢化物的信息有限，仅基于这份文档无法对它们在C-H键活化反应中的性质和机制进行全面比较。

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to answer the question about silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The text primarily discusses lutetium complexes and their C-H activation reactions. It does not provide details on zirconium or thorium hydrides supported on silica or alumina, nor does it discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. The literature also lacks information on reaction rates, selectivity, and the specific roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

The only somewhat relevant information is that a lutetium hydride complex catalyzes H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6, but this is not directly related to the zirconium and thorium systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be provided based solely on the given literature.

给定的文献没有足够的信息来回答关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的问题。该文本主要讨论了镥络合物及其C-H活化反应。它没有提供关于硅胶或氧化铝负载的锆或钍氢化物的详细信息，也没有讨论它们在H/D交换或烷烃复分解中的机理。文献也缺乏关于反应速率、选择性以及σ键复分解、氢解和链行走在这些过程中的具体作用的信息。

唯一稍微相关的信息是镥氢化物络合物可以催化四甲基硅烷与D2或C6D6之间的H/D交换，但这与问题中提到的锆和钍系统没有直接关系。因此，仅基于给定的文献无法提供对该问题的全面回答。

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to directly answer the question about silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document focuses on lutetium complexes and their C-H activation properties, not on zirconium or thorium hydrides.

The literature does mention some relevant information about C-H activation and H/D exchange reactions involving organometallic complexes:

1. A lutetium hydride complex catalyzes H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6.

2. Intermolecular C-H activation of tetramethylsilane occurs with a lutetium methyl complex at 40 °C, resulting in metallation and methane elimination.

3. The document notes that organolanthanide complexes containing the CH2SiMe3 ligand have been prepared by metathetical routes, rather than through C-H activation.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or detailed mechanisms for σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes. It also does not discuss silica or alumina supports or compare zirconium and thorium hydrides.

给定的文献没有足够的信息来直接回答关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的问题。该文档主要关注镥络合物及其C-H活化性质，而非锆或钍氢化物。

文献确实提到了一些关于涉及有机金属络合物的C-H活化和H/D交换反应的相关信息：

1. 一种镥氢化物络合物催化四甲基硅烷与D2或C6D6之间的H/D交换。

2. 镥甲基络合物在40°C下与四甲基硅烷发生分子间C-H活化，导致金属化和甲烷消除。

3. 文档指出，含有CH2SiMe3配体的有机镧系络合物是通过复分解路线制备的，而不是通过C-H活化。

然而，该文献没有提供关于反应速率、选择性或σ键复分解、氢解或链行走过程的详细机理的具体信息。它也没有讨论硅胶或氧化铝载体，或比较锆和钍氢化物。

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document focuses primarily on lutetium complexes and does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides.

However, the literature does mention that the lutetium hydride complex (2) can catalyze H/D exchange between tetramethylsilane and D2 or C6D6. This suggests that lutetium hydrides are capable of activating C-H bonds in alkanes like tetramethylsilane. The reaction is described as readily reversible, indicating a dynamic process.

The document notes that such intermolecular activation of tetramethylsilane is uncommon, highlighting the unique reactivity of these lutetium complexes. However, without specific information on zirconium and thorium hydrides, it is not possible to make direct comparisons regarding their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or reaction mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions.

The literature does not provide information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes for the requested metal hydrides.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。该文档主要关注镥配合物，并未讨论锆或钍氢化物。

然而，文献确实提到镥氢化物配合物(2)可以催化四甲基硅烷与D2或C6D6之间的H/D交换。这表明镥氢化物能够活化四甲基硅烷等烷烃的C-H键。该反应被描述为容易可逆，表明这是一个动态过程。

文档指出，这种四甲基硅烷的分子间活化并不常见，突显了这些镥配合物的独特反应性。然而，由于缺乏关于锆和钍氢化物的具体信息，无法直接比较它们在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构、催化性质或反应机理。

文献没有提供关于所要求的金属氢化物在这些过程中的反应速率、选择性或σ键复分解、氢解和链行走作用的信息。
