Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

The given literature does not contain information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document focuses on a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst (·SiO)2TaH for H/D exchange reactions between methane isotopomers. It does not discuss zirconium or thorium catalysts or their mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献不包含有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。该文档主要讨论了一种用于甲烷同位素之间H/D交换反应的硅胶负载钽氢化物催化剂(·SiO)2TaH。它没有讨论锆或钍催化剂及其在C-H键活化反应中的机理。因此，基于所提供的文献无法直接回答这个问题。

[1] "The silica supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1, catalyses the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150 C producing the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers."

[2] "When a 55+45 mixture of CH4/CD4 was contacted with 1 at 150 C for 10 h, it was converted into a mixture of all the isotopomers of methane as a statistical distribution"

[3] "The number of turnovers as defined in eqn. (1) is underestimated since it does not take into account degenerate processes such as the exchange of a D atom with another D atom. The calculated TON for the H/D exchange is therefore ca. 200 after 6 h of reaction."

[4] "A mechanism in which the tantalum hydride species is the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle rather than the TaCH3 species is consistent with the experimental observations."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It focuses on a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst for C-H bond activation reactions, specifically H/D exchange between CH4 and CD4.

The silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH catalyzes H/D exchange at 150°C, producing a statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. The reaction proceeds relatively quickly, with a turnover number of about 200 after 6 hours. This is significantly faster than alkane metathesis reactions catalyzed by the same complex.

The mechanism appears to involve σ-bond metathesis, with the tantalum hydride species acting as the active intermediate rather than a tantalum methyl species. The reaction likely proceeds through stepwise exchange of one H/D atom at a time.

The document does not provide information on alkane metathesis mechanisms, selectivity, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking for this catalyst. It also does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydride catalysts, so a comparison cannot be made based on the given information.

这篇文献没有提供关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。它主要关注硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化剂在C-H键活化反应中的应用，特别是CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应。

硅胶负载的钽氢化物(·SiO)2TaH在150°C下催化H/D交换反应，产生所有甲烷同位素异构体的统计分布。该反应进行得相对较快，6小时后的转化数约为200。这比同一复合物催化的烷烃复分解反应要快得多。

反应机理似乎涉及σ键复分解，其中钽氢化物物种作为活性中间体，而不是钽甲基物种。反应可能是通过逐步交换一个H/D原子来进行的。

文献没有提供这种催化剂的烷烃复分解机理、选择性、氢解或链行走的信息。它也没有讨论锆或钍氢化物催化剂，所以无法根据给定的信息进行比较。

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document primarily discusses a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst, (≡SiO)2TaH, and its role in H/D exchange reactions between CH4 and CD4. It does not provide any comparative information on zirconium or thorium hydrides.

The literature does not allow for a meaningful comparison of the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of the requested compounds. It also lacks information on their specific mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions, alkane metathesis, or details on reaction rates and selectivity for these particular catalysts.

While the document does discuss σ-bond metathesis in the context of the tantalum hydride catalyst, it does not provide information on hydrogenolysis or chain walking processes for zirconium or thorium hydrides.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, it is not possible to answer the question as posed.

给定的文献中不包含任何关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。该文档主要讨论了一种硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化剂(≡SiO)2TaH,以及它在CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应中的作用。它没有提供任何关于锆或钍氢化物的比较信息。

该文献不允许对所要求的化合物的制备、结构和催化性能进行有意义的比较。它也缺乏这些特定催化剂在C-H键活化反应、烷烃复分解中的具体机理,或反应速率和选择性的详细信息。

虽然该文档确实在钽氢化物催化剂的背景下讨论了σ-键复分解,但它没有提供锆或钍氢化物的氢解或链行走过程的信息。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息,无法回答所提出的问题。
