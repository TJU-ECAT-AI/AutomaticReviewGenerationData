[1] "The silica supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH 1, catalyses the H/D exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 at 150 C producing the statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers."

[2] "When a 55+45 mixture of CH4/CD4 was contacted with 1 at 150 C for 10 h, it was converted into a mixture of all the isotopomers of methane as a statistical distribution"

[3] "The number of turnovers as defined in eqn. (1) is underestimated since it does not take into account degenerate processes such as the exchange of a D atom with another D atom. The calculated TON for the H/D exchange is therefore ca. 200 after 6 h of reaction."

[4] "A mechanism in which the tantalum hydride species is the active intermediate in the catalytic cycle rather than the TaCH3 species is consistent with the experimental observations."

The literature does not provide information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It focuses on a silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst for C-H bond activation reactions, specifically H/D exchange between CH4 and CD4.

The silica-supported tantalum hydride (·SiO)2TaH catalyzes H/D exchange at 150°C, producing a statistical distribution of all methane isotopomers. The reaction proceeds relatively quickly, with a turnover number of about 200 after 6 hours. This is significantly faster than alkane metathesis reactions catalyzed by the same complex.

The mechanism appears to involve σ-bond metathesis, with the tantalum hydride species acting as the active intermediate rather than a tantalum methyl species. The reaction likely proceeds through stepwise exchange of one H/D atom at a time.

The document does not provide information on alkane metathesis mechanisms, selectivity, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking for this catalyst. It also does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydride catalysts, so a comparison cannot be made based on the given information.

这篇文献没有提供关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。它主要关注硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化剂在C-H键活化反应中的应用，特别是CH4和CD4之间的H/D交换反应。

硅胶负载的钽氢化物(·SiO)2TaH在150°C下催化H/D交换反应，产生所有甲烷同位素异构体的统计分布。该反应进行得相对较快，6小时后的转化数约为200。这比同一复合物催化的烷烃复分解反应要快得多。

反应机理似乎涉及σ键复分解，其中钽氢化物物种作为活性中间体，而不是钽甲基物种。反应可能是通过逐步交换一个H/D原子来进行的。

文献没有提供这种催化剂的烷烃复分解机理、选择性、氢解或链行走的信息。它也没有讨论锆或钍氢化物催化剂，所以无法根据给定的信息进行比较。
