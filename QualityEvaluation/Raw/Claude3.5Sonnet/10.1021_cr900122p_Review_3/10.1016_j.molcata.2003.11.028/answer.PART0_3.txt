[1] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reactions lead to the formation of (SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66] as the major supported species"

[2] "Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy techniques have allowed us to identify another supported species which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless significant amounts on the surface: (SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6]."

[3] "These two well-defined zirconium hydride complexes supported on silicaalumina [67], already known to catalyse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]."

[4] "With group 4 metal hydrides, the proposed mechanism of this catalytic reaction involves a -alkyl transfer [4153] as the key step of the CC bond cleavage"

[5] "Besides alkane hydrogenolysis, the silica-supported (SiOSi)(SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses alkane metathesis, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues [74,75]."

The literature does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can discuss the preparation, structure and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides based on the available information:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment with hydrogen.

Structure: Two main species are formed:
1. (SiO)3ZrH as the major species 
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 as a minor but significant species

Catalytic properties:
1. These zirconium hydrides catalyze ethylene and propylene polymerization.
2. They can also depolymerize the resulting polymers.
3. They are active in C-H bond activation, specifically in alkane hydrogenolysis.

Mechanism: The mechanism for C-C bond cleavage in alkane hydrogenolysis involves β-alkyl transfer as a key step.

The literature also mentions that silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyzes alkane metathesis, transforming linear or branched alkanes into higher and lower homologues. However, the mechanism for this reaction is not explicitly compared to zirconium hydrides.

The document does not provide information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis and chain walking for these catalysts. It also lacks information on H/D exchange reactions.

由于文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，根据可用信息，我可以讨论二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四新戊基锆接枝到部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后在氢气下处理而制得的。

结构：形成了两种主要物种：
1. (SiO)3ZrH 作为主要物种
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 作为次要但显著的物种

催化性质：
1. 这些锆氢化物可以催化乙烯和丙烯聚合。
2. 它们还可以使所得到的聚合物解聚。
3. 它们在C-H键活化中具有活性，特别是在烷烃氢解反应中。

机理：烷烃氢解中C-C键断裂的机理涉及β-烷基转移作为关键步骤。

文献还提到，二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物可以催化烷烃复分解反应，将线性或支链烷烃转化为更高和更低的同系物。然而，这个反应的机理并没有与锆氢化物的机理进行明确比较。

文献没有提供这些催化剂的反应速率、选择性或σ-键复分解和链行走作用的信息。它也缺乏关于H/D交换反应的信息。
