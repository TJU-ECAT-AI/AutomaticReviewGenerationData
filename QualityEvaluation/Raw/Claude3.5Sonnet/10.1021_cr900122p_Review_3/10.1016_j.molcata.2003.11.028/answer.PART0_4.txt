[1] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reactions lead to the formation of (SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66] as the major supported species"

[2] "Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy techniques have allowed us to identify another supported species which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless significant amounts on the surface: (SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6]."

[3] "These two well-defined zirconium hydride complexes supported on silicaalumina [67], already known to catalyse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]."

[4] "Besides alkane hydrogenolysis, the silica-supported (SiOSi)(SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses alkane metathesis, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues [74,75]."

[5] "In order to explain the productive and the degenerative metathesis, a specific mechanism of CC bond cleavage and formation can be suggested such as a four centred -bond metathesis transition state, an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway or a carbenic mechanism"

The literature provided does not contain information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can describe the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides based on the available information:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment under hydrogen.

Structure: Two main species are formed:
1. (SiO)3ZrH as the major supported species
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 as a minor but significant species

Catalytic properties:
1. These zirconium hydrides catalyze ethylene and propylene polymerization.
2. They also catalyze the depolymerization of the resulting polymers.
3. They are active in alkane hydrogenolysis.

The literature does not provide specific information on H/D exchange reactions for zirconium hydrides. However, for alkane metathesis, the mechanism is described for a tantalum hydride catalyst, which may share some similarities with zirconium hydrides:

Mechanism: The alkane metathesis reaction involves C-C bond cleavage and formation. Possible mechanisms include:
1. A four-centered σ-bond metathesis transition state
2. An oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway
3. A carbene mechanism

The reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues. There is also mention of a faster, unproductive "degenerative metathesis" process occurring simultaneously with the productive metathesis.

The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the role of chain walking for these catalysts.

提供的文献中没有关于氧化铝支持的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，我可以根据可用信息描述二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物的制备、结构和催化性能：

制备：二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物是通过将四新戊基锆分子复合物接枝到部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后在氢气下处理而制得的。

结构：形成了两种主要物种：
1. (SiO)3ZrH 作为主要支持物种
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 作为次要但显著的物种

催化性能：
1. 这些锆氢化物催化乙烯和丙烯聚合。
2. 它们还催化所得聚合物的解聚。
3. 它们在烷烃加氢裂解中具有活性。

文献中没有提供锆氢化物在H/D交换反应方面的具体信息。然而，对于烷烃复分解反应，文献描述了钽氢化物催化剂的机理，这可能与锆氢化物有一些相似之处：

机理：烷烃复分解反应涉及C-C键的断裂和形成。可能的机制包括：
1. 四中心σ-键复分解过渡态
2. 氧化加成/还原消除途径
3. 卡宾机制

该反应将直链或支链烷烃转化为其更高和更低的同系物。还提到了一个更快的、非生产性的"退化复分解"过程，它与生产性复分解同时发生。

文献没有提供这些催化剂的具体反应速率、选择性或链行走作用的信息。
