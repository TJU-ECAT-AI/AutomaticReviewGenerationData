[1] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reactions lead to the formation of (SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66] as the major supported species"

[2] "Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy techniques have allowed us to identify another supported species which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless significant amounts on the surface: (SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6]."

[3] "These two well-defined zirconium hydride complexes supported on silicaalumina [67], already known to catalyse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]."

[4] "With group 4 metal hydrides, the proposed mechanism of this catalytic reaction involves a -alkyl transfer [4153] as the key step of the CC bond cleavage"

[5] "Besides alkane hydrogenolysis, the silica-supported (SiOSi)(SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses alkane metathesis, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues [74,75]."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can describe the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides based on the available information:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment with hydrogen.

Structure: Two main species are formed:
1. (SiO)3ZrH as the major species
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 as a minor species

Catalytic properties:
1. These complexes catalyze ethylene and propylene polymerization.
2. They also catalyze the depolymerization of the resulting polymers.
3. They are active in alkane hydrogenolysis.

Mechanism: The proposed mechanism for C-C bond cleavage involves β-alkyl transfer as a key step.

The literature does not provide specific information about H/D exchange reactions for these catalysts. Regarding alkane metathesis, the document mentions that silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyzes this reaction, transforming linear or branched alkanes into higher and lower homologues. However, it does not explicitly state whether zirconium hydrides perform this reaction.

The document does not provide information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis and chain walking for these catalysts.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，根据可用信息，我可以描述二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四新戊基锆grafting到部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后进行氢气处理而制得的。

结构：形成了两种主要物种：
1. (SiO)3ZrH 作为主要物种
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 作为次要物种

催化性质：
1. 这些络合物可以催化乙烯和丙烯聚合。
2. 它们还可以催化所得聚合物的解聚。
3. 它们在烷烃氢解反应中有活性。

机理：C-C键断裂的提议机理涉及β-烷基转移作为关键步骤。

文献中没有提供这些催化剂在H/D交换反应中的具体信息。关于烷烃复分解反应，文档提到二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物可以催化这种反应，将线性或支链烷烃转化为更高和更低的同系物。然而，它并未明确说明锆氢化物是否能进行这种反应。

文档没有提供关于这些催化剂的反应速率、选择性或σ键复分解和链行走作用的信息。
