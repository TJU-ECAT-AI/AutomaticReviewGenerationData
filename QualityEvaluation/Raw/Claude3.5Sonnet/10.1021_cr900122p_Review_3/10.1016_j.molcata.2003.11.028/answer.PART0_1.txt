[1] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reactions lead to the formation of (SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66] as the major supported species"

[2] "Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy techniques have allowed us to identify another supported species which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless significant amounts on the surface: (SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6]."

[3] "These two well-defined zirconium hydride complexes supported on silicaalumina [67], already known to catalyse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]."

[4] "With group 4 metal hydrides, the proposed mechanism of this catalytic reaction involves a -alkyl transfer [4153] as the key step of the CC bond cleavage"

[5] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride, [(SiO)2TaH], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(SiO)2ZrH2] and [(SiO)3ZrH] both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metalstantalum hydride is able to cleave the CC bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not."

[6] "Besides alkane hydrogenolysis, the silica-supported (SiOSi)(SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses alkane metathesis, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues [74,75]."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can provide details on the silica-supported zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium complexes onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment with hydrogen.

Structure: Two main species are formed:
1. (SiO)3ZrH as the major species
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 in smaller but significant amounts

Catalytic properties in C-H bond activation:

1. These zirconium hydrides catalyze ethylene and propylene polymerization, as well as depolymerization of the resulting polymers.

2. They are active in low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes, but cannot cleave the C-C bond of ethane.

3. The mechanism for C-C bond cleavage involves β-alkyl transfer as a key step.

For alkane metathesis, the literature mainly discusses tantalum hydrides rather than zirconium hydrides. Silica-supported tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] catalyzes alkane metathesis, transforming linear or branched alkanes into higher and lower homologues.

The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis and chain walking for these catalysts in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，我可以提供关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的详细信息：

制备方法：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四新戊基锆络合物接枝到部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后在氢气下处理而制得的。

结构：主要形成两种物种：
1. (SiO)3ZrH 作为主要物种
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 以较小但显著的数量存在

在C-H键活化中的催化性能：

1. 这些锆氢化物能催化乙烯和丙烯的聚合，以及所得聚合物的解聚。

2. 它们在低温下能催化烷烃的氢解，但不能断裂乙烷的C-C键。

3. C-C键断裂的机理涉及β-烷基转移作为关键步骤。

关于烷烃复分解反应，文献主要讨论了钽氢化物而非锆氢化物。二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]能催化烷烃复分解，将直链或支链烷烃转化为更高和更低的同系物。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在H/D交换和烷烃复分解反应中的具体反应速率、选择性或σ键复分解和链行走的作用信息。
