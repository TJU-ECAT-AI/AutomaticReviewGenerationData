[1] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reactions lead to the formation of (SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66] as the major supported species"

[2] "Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy techniques have allowed us to identify another supported species which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless significant amounts on the surface: (SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6]."

[3] "These two well-defined zirconium hydride complexes supported on silicaalumina [67], already known to catalyse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]."

[4] "With group 4 metal hydrides, the proposed mechanism of this catalytic reaction involves a -alkyl transfer [4153] as the key step of the CC bond cleavage"

[5] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride, [(SiO)2TaH], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(SiO)2ZrH2] and [(SiO)3ZrH] both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metalstantalum hydride is able to cleave the CC bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not."

[6] "Besides alkane hydrogenolysis, the silica-supported (SiOSi)(SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses alkane metathesis, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues [74,75]."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can provide information about the silica-supported zirconium hydrides and their properties:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium complexes onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment with hydrogen.

Structure: Two main species are formed:
1) (SiO)3ZrH as the major species
2) (SiO)2ZrH2 as a minor but significant species

Catalytic properties:
1. C-H bond activation: Zirconium hydrides catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes, but cannot cleave the C-C bond of ethane.

2. Polymerization/Depolymerization: These catalysts can polymerize ethylene and propylene, and also depolymerize the resulting polymers.

3. Mechanism: The key step in C-C bond cleavage for zirconium hydrides involves β-alkyl transfer.

4. Alkane metathesis: While not explicitly stated for zirconium hydrides, the text mentions that silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyzes alkane metathesis, transforming linear or branched alkanes into higher and lower homologues.

The document does not provide specific information about reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis and chain walking for zirconium hydrides. It also lacks information on H/D exchange reactions for these catalysts.

该文献没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但我可以提供关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物及其性质的信息：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四新戊基锆络合物接枝到部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后在氢气处理下制备而成。

结构：形成了两种主要物种：
1) (SiO)3ZrH 作为主要物种
2) (SiO)2ZrH2 作为次要但重要的物种

催化性质：
1. C-H键活化：锆氢化物可以催化烷烃的低温氢解，但不能裂解乙烷的C-C键。

2. 聚合/解聚：这些催化剂可以聚合乙烯和丙烯，也可以解聚所得的聚合物。

3. 机理：锆氢化物C-C键裂解的关键步骤涉及β-烷基转移。

4. 烷烃复分解：虽然没有明确说明锆氢化物的情况，但文中提到二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物可以催化烷烃复分解，将线性或支链烷烃转化为更高和更低的同系物。

该文献未提供关于锆氢化物的具体反应速率、选择性或σ-键复分解和链行走作用的信息。它也缺乏这些催化剂的H/D交换反应的信息。

Structure: Two main species are formed:

Catalytic properties in C-H bond activation:

1. These zirconium hydrides catalyze ethylene and propylene polymerization, as well as depolymerization of the resulting polymers.

2. They are active in low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes, but cannot cleave the C-C bond of ethane.

3. The mechanism for C-C bond cleavage involves β-alkyl transfer as a key step.

For alkane metathesis, the literature mainly discusses tantalum hydrides rather than zirconium hydrides. Silica-supported tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] catalyzes alkane metathesis, transforming linear or branched alkanes into higher and lower homologues.

The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis and chain walking for these catalysts in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions.

1. A four-centered σ-bond metathesis transition state
2. An oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway
3. A carbene mechanism

The reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues. There is also mention of a faster, unproductive "degenerative metathesis" process occurring simultaneously with the productive metathesis.

The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the role of chain walking for these catalysts.
