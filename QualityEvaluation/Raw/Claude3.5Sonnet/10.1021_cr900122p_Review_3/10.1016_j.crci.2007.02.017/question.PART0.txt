Abstract
Grafting of [Mo(NAr)(]CHCMe2R)(CH2tBu)2], 1-R (R  Me or Ph) on the surface silanols of SiO2-(700) gives 2-R through the
electrophilic cleavage of the MoeC s-bond according to labelling (GC/MS and solid-state NMR) and reactivity studies (monitor-
ing initiation). Similarly, molecular silanol derivatives react with 1-Ph also to give directly the monosiloxy derivatives. Therefore,
surface or molecular silanols have reactivities similar to alcohols and phenols having pKa  9. Finally, the surface complex 2-R
(R  Me or Ph) is a highly efficient olefin metathesis catalyst. To cite this article: F. Blanc et al., C. R. Chimie 11 (2008).

carbonecarbon bonds whether it is used in fine chemi-
cal or polymer synthesis [1e4]. In contrast, classical
heterogeneous catalysts based on silica or alumina sup-
ported Mo, W or Re oxides have been limited by their
incompatibility with functionalized olefins. Because
heterogeneous catalysts have some advantages in terms
of developing chemical processes (easy separation of
products from the metal residue, continuous flow pro-
cess), a large effort has therefore been devoted at devel-
oping supported homogeneous catalysts derived from
Schrock or Grubbs type catalysts [5e8]. However, cur-
rently none of these supported systems out-performed
their homogeneous equivalents. Another approach can
also be undertaken, called Surface Organometallic
Chemistry, which consists in using silica as a solid
siloxy ligand: this has the advantage to heterogenize
organometallic complexes [9], but also to activate the
metal center [10,11] and to stabilize the system through
site isolation so that highly active well-defined olefin
metathesis catalysts can be obtained based on Mo, W
and Re (Scheme 1) [12e19]. All the characterization
data (IR, NMR, EXAFS, DFT calculation) show that
well-defined monosiloxy species, with spectroscopic
properties very close to their corresponding molecular
species, are obtained when prepared by reacting well-
defined metal complexes having at least one neopentyl
ligand on a silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 C
(SiO2-(700)). Overall, one MeC bond has been cleaved
and one MeO bond has been formed during grafting,
but detailed mechanistic study of the reaction of
[Re(CtBu)(]CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] have shown that a
simple electrophilic cleavage of the MeC bond through
s-bond metathesis does not account for the isotopic la-
belling experiment [20]. Notably, [Mo(NAr)(]CHC-
Me2R)(CH2tBu)2] [21] (1-Me, R  Me or 1-Ph, R  Ph)
reacts with alcohols and phenols either via direct s-bond
metathesis or addition of the OeH on the alkylidene
double bond depending on the size and the pKa of the
reagent [22,23]. In order to gain more insight into the
(molecular) property of the isolated silanols present at
the surface of silica, we have investigated in detail the
grafting mechanism of [Mo(NAr)(]CHCMe2R)
(CH2tBu)2] (R  Me or Ph) (1-R) on SiO2-(700).
2. Results and discussion
First, grafting of [Mo(NAr)(]CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2]
(1-Me) on deuterated SiO2-(700) (75% deuterated) gives
1.0 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane, 75  5% monodeu-
terated. In principle, the deuterated silanol group can
react as follows (Scheme 2):
- in one step, directly via the reaction of the MoeC
s-bond leading to 2-Me and to 100% mono-
deuterated 2,2-dimethyl propane (mechanism i),
- in two steps, with first the reaction of the Mo]C
leading to 3-Me, followed by its decomposition into
2-Me and a one-to-one mixture of non- and mono-
deuterated 2,2-dimethylpropane (mechanism ii),
- in two steps, with first reaction with the MoNAr
leading to 4-Me, followed by its decomposition
into 2-Me along with 100% mono-deuterated 2,2-
dimethylpropane (mechanism iii).
The labelling is therefore consistent with mechanisms
i and/or iii, and in order to further understand the graft-
ing mechanism, we have also investigated the grafting
of 1-Me selectively labelled on the methylene of the
neopentyl carbons [Mo(NAr)(]CHtBu)(*CH2tBu)2]
(1*-Me) and that of the bisneopentyl neophylidene
complex (1-Ph).
Firstly, it is worth mentioning that the synthesis of
the metal carbon single and double bonds in the prepa-
ration of [Mo(NAr)(]CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (1-Me)
are introduced in two different alkylation steps: (1)
the Mo]C double bond is generated during the treat-
ment
of
[Mo(NAr)2(CH2R)2]
with
triflic
acid
(TfOH) in dimethoxyethane (dme), which yields the tri-
flate derivatives, [Mo(NAr)(]CHR)(OTf)2(dme)2]
[24], and (2) the singly bonded neopentyl ligand is
introduced by reaction of the Grignard reagent [tBuCH2
MgCl] on the aforementioned triflate derivatives. This

strategy has been used to prepare selectively [Mo(N-
Ar)(]CHCMe2R)(CH2tBu)2] (R  Ph) and one isoto-
pomer, 1*-Me, labelled on the neopentyl ligand, [Mo(
NAr)(]CHtBu)(*CH2tBu)2]. In the latter case, no H-
transfer occurs over a one-month period for a 0.01 M
C6D6 solution of 1*-Me maintained at 25 C accordingto
1H NMR [25]. Upon grafting of 1*-Me on SiO2-(700),
0.9 equiv.
of
2,2-dimethylpropane,
93  5%
13C
mono-labelled was formed, which is consistent with
a selective cleavage of the MoeC s-bond. The ana-
lytical data on the resulting solid are all similar to
those of 2-Me [18], but for the 13C solid-state CP
MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 1), which displays only
one intense signal at 56 ppm, corresponding to the
13C labelled methylene carbon of the neopentyl ligand
attached to Mo, along with the expected low-intensity
signals of the unlabelled carbon of 2-Me. The forma-
tion of
13C labelled 2,2-dimethylpropane (93  5%)
and the absence of the carbenic signal at 279 ppm [18]
(Scheme 3) is consistent with a selective grafting
through the electrophilic cleavage of the MoeC s-
bond (Scheme 2, mechanism i).
Secondly, grafting of 1-Ph also gives 0.9 equiv. of
2,2-dimethylpropane per grafted Mo, as observed for
1-Me. Monitoring the reaction by IR spectroscopy
shows the disappearance of surface silanols, and the
appearance of bands associated with aromatic and alkyl
ligands still bound to Mo (Fig. 2). The resulting solid
contains 2.14%wt Mo (0.22 mmol/g), which is close to

that expected for a quantitative grafting on all surface
silanols (maximum density: 0.26 mmol/g), which is con-
sistent with what has been observed by IR spectroscopy.
Furthermore, the solid contains 7.27%wt C (27 C/Mo), in
agreement with the formation of 2-Ph (expected 27
C/Mo). Moreover, the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 3a)
displays the following signals: 11.4 (Mo]CH), 6.9 (ar-
omatic CeH), 3.5 (CHMe2), 2.0 (CH2tBu) and 0.9 ppm
(Me) (Table 1), while the 13C solid-state CP MAS NMR
spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows signals at 153e122 (Ar), 56

with the structure 2-Ph (Scheme 4), the alkylidene car-
bon (Mo]CH) at 283 ppm being only a weak signal at
natural abundance, as previously observed for other
complexes [12,13,18,19]. We have also investigated
the reactivity of 1-Ph with molecular silanols, [(c-C5
H9)7Si7O12SieOH] (POSSeOH) [26] or [(tBuO)3Si
OH]. Monitoring the reaction by solution NMR spec-
troscopy shows that no intermediate such as 3 or 4 was
formed, and that 2m-Ph and 2n-Ph were directly
and selectively obtained via s-bond metathesis accord-
ing to 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 4).
Notably, 2-Me and 2-Ph display very high activity in
olefin metathesis. Whether starting from 2-Me and
2-Ph, similar initial rates (1 s1) are obtained, and

they equilibrate 500 equiv. of propene in 20 min. In
contrast, while 0.87 equiv. of 3/1 mixture of 2,2-dime-
thylbutene and Z 3,3-dimethyl-2-pentene, the initiating
product resulting from the cross-metathesis of propene
with the neopentylidene ligand, are detected for 2-Me,
less than 0.02 equiv. is detected for 2-Ph, which is con-
sistent with the formation of 2-Ph (presence of the
neophylidene ligand) as the major surface species. We
have also tested these catalysts in a flow reactor at
30 C using propene (320 mL/min). Using 2-Me
(49 mg, 2.1 %wt Mo, 1240 mol propene/mol Mo/min),
the initial conversion (at 6 min) corresponds to a turn-
over frequency of 120 mol propene/mol Mo/min, and
the productivity decreases with time on stream (deacti-
vation). After 1500 min, ca. 20 000 mol of propene per
Mo have been transformed through metathesis (Fig. 4).
The selectivities slowly evolve with time1, and after
400 min they are nearly constant: ethylene (50%), E
2-butene (ca. 22%) and Z 2-butene (ca. 28%) along
with small amounts of 1-butene (0.3%) and 2-pentenes
(0.06%). 1-Butene is probably formed via rearrange-
ment of the intermediate metallacyclobutanes, and the
2-pentenes via cross-metathesis of propene or 2-butenes
with 1-butene. The E to Z 2-butenes ratio is 0.8, which
shows that the catalyst is slightly Z selective. As
observed in the batch reactor, using 2-Ph in place of
2-Me shows exactly the same performances in a flow
reactor (similar initial rates, TON and selectivities).
3. Conclusion
Grafting of 1-R (R  Me or Ph) on the surface sila-
nols of SiO2-(700) occurs selectively through the electro-
philic cleavage of the MoeC s-bond bond to give 2-R
according to labelling (GC/MS and solid-state NMR),
reactivity studies (monitoring initiation) and molecular
models. This shows that surface or molecular silanols
have reactivities similar to those of alcohols and phe-
nols having pKa  9 [23], which is consistent with
the proposed pKa for the silanol, ca. 9, determined
through the use of POSSeOH [27]. Moreover, we
have shown that 2-R are highly efficient olefin metath-
esis catalysts (R  Me or Ph). These new generations of

creases, hence the contact time by active sites changes so that the se-
lectivity changes and the observed butene ratio tends towards the
kinetic ratio.

heterogeneous catalysts already display reactivity and
stability greater than their isoelectronic homogeneous
equivalents, and further development is currently
underway. This also shows that it is now possible to
develop well-defined heterogeneous catalysts through
a structureereactivity relationship.

4.1. General procedure
Allexperimentswerecarriedoutunderdryandoxygen-
free Ar using either standard Schlenk or glove-box
techniques for the organometallic synthesis. For the syn-
theses and the treatments of the surface species, reactions
were carried out using high vacuum lines (1.34 Pa)
and glove-box techniques. [tBuCH2MgCl] [28], [Mo
(NAr)(]CHtBu)(OTf)2(dme)2]
[24],
(Ar  2,6-
iPr2C6H3) [Mo(NAr)(]CHCMe2R)(CH2tBu)2] (1-R)
(R  Me or Ph) [22], were synthesized according to liter-
ature procedure. 99% 13C labelled [Mo(NAr)(]CHt
Bu)(*CH2tBu)2] (1*-Me) was synthesized according
to a published procedure from [Mo(NAr)(]CHt
Bu)(OTf)2(dme)2] and [(1-13C 99%) tBu13CH2MgCl]
[20]. Silica (Aerosil Degussa, 200 m2g1) was com-
pacted with distilled water, calcined at 500 C under
air for 2 h and treated under vacuum (1.34 Pa) at
500 C for 12 h and then at 700 C for 4 h (support
referred to as SiO2-(700)). [(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SieOH]
(Aldrich, 99%) was dried under vacuum (1.34 Pa) at
60 C for 16 h prior to use. C6D6 (SDS) was distilled
from sodium benzophenone ketyl. Pentane and toluene
were distilled from NaK under N2. Propene (N, LAir
Liquide) was purified over MS 4 A
 prior to use. Elemen-
tal analyses were performed at the University of Bour-
gogne, Dijon (C and N) and at the Service Central
Analyse in Solaize (Mo). Gas phase analyses were per-
formed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 series II gas chroma-
tography (GC) apparatus equipped with a flame
ionization detector (FID) and a KCl/Al2O2 column
(50 m  0.32 mm). Liquid-phase analyses were per-
formed on a Hewlett Packard 6890 series II GC appara-
tus equipped with a FID detector and an HP1 column
(30 m  0.32 mm). Products were identified by GC/
MS (HP G1800A) equipped with a KCl/Al2O2 or an
HP1 column. Liquid-state NMR spectra were recorded
in C6D6 using a Bruker AC 300 spectrometer or Bruker
DRX-500 spectrometer and referenced to the residual
protonated solvent peaks (1H dH  7.15 ppm,
13C
dC  128.0 ppm). Coupling constants are reported in
Hz. The H and C assignments were established by
DEPT 135, hsqc and hmbc 2D NMR experiments. All
solid-state NMR spectra were recorded under MAS on
a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer with a conventional
double resonance 4-mm CP-MAS probe operating at
12.5 kHz of MAS for all the spectra. The samples were
introduced in a 4-mm zirconia rotor in the glove box
and tightly closed. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm
downfield from SiMe4 ( 0.1 and 1 ppm for 1H and
13C NMR spectra, respectively). All the proton spectra
were obtained by accumulation of eight scans and a recy-
cle delay of 3 s. All the carbon spectra were acquired un-
der TPPM-15
1H decoupling at n1
H  83 kHz. The
recycle delay was set to 1 s. An exponential line broad-
ening of 80 Hz was applied before Fourier transform.
4.1.1. Preparation of deuterated silica (SiO2-D-(700))
When deuterated silica was used, after partial dehy-
droxylation under vacuum (1.34 Pa) at 500 C for 12 h,
the silica was exposed to D2O vapor for 10 min at room
temperature, followed by reaction at 60 C for 1 h and
partial dehydroxylation at 500 C for 5 h (4e5 cycles).
After partial dehydroxylation at 700 C for 4 h (support
referred to as SiO2-D-(700)), the silica was 75% deuterated
according to titration with [tBuCH2MgCl] and quantifi-
cation by GC/MS of the d0-2,2-dimethylpropane (25%)

4.1.4. Preparation of [(SiO)Mo(NAr)
(]CHCMe2Ph)(CH2tBu)] (2-Ph) monitored
by in situ IR spectroscopy
Silica (38 mg) was pressed into a 18-mm self-
supporting disk, put into a sealed glass high-vacuum re-
actor equipped with CaF2 windows. After calcination at
500 C under air for 2 h, the silica disk was treated under
vacuum (1.34 Pa) at 500 C for 12 h and then at 700 C
for 4 h. The silica support thus obtained, referred to as
SiO2-(700) (38 mg, 9 mmol SiOH), was then immersed
into a pentane (12 mL) solution of [Mo(NAr)(]
CHCMe2Ph)(CH2tBu)2]
(1-Ph)
(20 mg,
37 mmol,
4 equiv.) at 25 C for 2 h, followed by washing three
times with pentane (12 mL) and drying under vacuum
(1.34 Pa) at 25 C for 1 h. IR: 3690, 3606, 3090, 3064,
3026, 2968, 2936, 2913, 2875, 1600, 1587, 1573,

4.1.5. Preparation of [(SiO)Mo(NAr)
(]CHCMe2Ph)(CH2tBu)] (2-Ph) by impregnation
of [Mo(NAr)(]CHCMe2Ph)(CH2tBu)2]
(1-Ph) onto SiO2-(700)
Representative procedure: A mixture of [Mo(NAr)
(]CHCMe2Ph)(CH2tBu)2] (1-Ph) (164 mg, 0.30 mmol)
and SiO2-(700) (1.00 g, 0.26 mmol SiOH) in pentane
(15 mL) was stirred at 25 C for 30 min. After filtration,
the yellow solid was washed three times with pentane,
and all volatiles were condensed into another reactor of
known volume (>6 L) in order to quantify 2,2-dimethyl-
propane released during grafting. The resulting yellow
powder was dried thoroughly under vacuum (1.34 Pa) at
25 C for 1 h to yield [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(]CHC-
Me3Ph)(CH2tBu)] (2-Ph). Analysis by gas chrom-
atography indicated the formation of 0.24 mmol of
2,2-dimethylpropane during grafting (0.9 tBuCH3/Mo).
No tertiobutylbenzene could be detected during grafting
by neither gas chromatography nor NMR. 1H MAS

4.1.6. Synthesis of [(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SieOeMo
(NAr)(]CHCMe2Ph)(CH2tBu)] (2m-Ph)
A suspension of [(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SieOH] (312 mg,
0.34 mmol) in pentane (10 mL) was added dropwise
at 25 C to a red solution of [Mo(NAr)(]CHC-
Me2Ph)(CH2tBu)2] (1-Ph) (185 mg, 0.34 mmol) in pen-
tane (10 mL). The color changed from deep red-orange
to orange over 30 min at 25 C. After 4 h at 25 C, all
volatiles were then condensed into another reactor of
knownvolume (>6 L) in order to quantify 2,2-dimethyl-
propane released during grafting. Analysis by gas chro-
matography indicated the formation of 0.20 mmol of
2,2-dimethylpropane during grafting (1.0 tBuCH3/
Mo). Moreover no tertiobutylbenzene was observed by
gas chromatography. The resulting oily solid was
extracted with a minimum amount of pentane (2 mL)
and an orange powder (279 mg, 0.20 mmol, 59%) crys-
tallised out upon removing the solvent under vacuo. 1H

4.1.9. Reaction with propene (500 equiv.)
The solid 2-R (R  Me or Ph) (20 mmol) was con-
tacted with propene (500 Torr, 10 mmol, 500 equiv.)
in a 370-mL reactor flask at 25 C. Small aliquots
were analysed by GC over time to follow the conversion
and the formation of cross metathesis product. Analysis
of the gas phase showed, for 2-Me, the formation of
0.65 equiv. of 3,3-dimethylbutene and 0.22 equiv. of
4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene, which are the cross-metathesis
products between neopentylidene and propene in con-
trast to 2-Ph, where only 0.013 equiv. of 3,3-dimethyl-
butene and 0.003 equiv. of 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene
were obtained under identical reaction conditions. After
20 min, propene was equilibrated (34% conversion)
into a 1:1 mixture of ethene and butenes (2.6:1 mixture
of trans and cis isomers) in both cases.
4.1.10. Propene metathesis in a flow reactor
Representativeprocedure:Thesolid2-Me(10.7 mmol)
was loaded in a flow reactor in the glove box, the isolated
reaction chamber was then connected to the propene line,
the propene pressure was set to 1 bar, and the tubes were
flushed with propene (purified on R-3/11 from BASF
and MS 4 A
 ) for 2 h. Before opening the reaction, the
flow rate was set to 320 mL/min (20.7 mol propene/
(mol Mo.min), the temperature was set to 30 C. The
opening of the valve corresponds to the beginning of the
catalysis and the reaction was monitored by GC using
an auto-sampler. The same procedure was used for 2-Ph
(12 mmol).
