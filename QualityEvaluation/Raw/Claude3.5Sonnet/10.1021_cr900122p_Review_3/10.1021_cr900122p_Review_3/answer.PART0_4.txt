[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides on silica surfaces. The bis-hydride species is found to be more reactive towards CH4. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but with some differences:

1. Zirconium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures
- The reaction occurs via a stepwise insertion of deuterium
- The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis
- This process regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium into the alkane
- The reaction is very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature

2. Thorium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures
- The reaction is fast, with rates of 800-1200 h^-1
- Slightly selective for terminal CH bonds
- Overall, the deuterium incorporation is not selective
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during the H/D exchange process

Reaction Mechanisms:
The zirconium hydride system operates through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism followed by hydrogenolysis. For the thorium hydride system, while σ-bond metathesis is not explicitly mentioned, the process involves β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism, particularly for the isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes.

In summary, while both systems effectively catalyze H/D exchange reactions, they differ in their preparation methods, structures, and specific mechanistic details. The zirconium system shows a clear preference for the bis-hydride species and operates via a well-defined σ-bond metathesis mechanism, while the thorium system demonstrates some selectivity for terminal CH bonds and involves chain walking processes.

制备和结构：
二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物是作为单氢化物和双氢化物的混合物在二氧化硅表面上制备的。研究发现双氢化物物种对CH4的反应性更高。相比之下，氧化铝支持的钍氢化物是通过在H2下处理脱羟基氧化铝上支持的Th(allyl)4生成的。

催化性质和机理：
两个系统都能催化H/D交换反应，但存在一些差异：

1. 锆氢化物：
- 催化H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中的H/D交换
- 反应通过氘的逐步插入进行
- 机理涉及两步过程：通过σ键复分解进行CH键活化，形成金属-烷基中间体，随后进行氢解
- 这个过程再生金属氢化物并将氘掺入烷烃中
- 反应非常快，即使在室温以下的温度下也是如此

2. 钍氢化物：
- 催化D2/烷烃混合物中的H/D交换
- 反应速度快，速率为800-1200 h^-1
- 对端基CH键稍有选择性
- 总体而言，氘的掺入不具选择性
- 二甲基环己烷在H/D交换过程中发生顺反异构化

反应机理：
锆氢化物系统通过σ键复分解机理followed by 氢解过程进行。对于钍氢化物系统，虽然没有明确提到σ键复分解，但该过程涉及β-H转移和链行走机理，特别是对于二甲基环己烷的异构化。

总之，虽然两个系统都能有效地催化H/D交换反应，但它们在制备方法、结构和具体机理细节上存在差异。锆系统明显偏好双氢化物物种，并通过明确定义的σ键复分解机理运作，而钍系统对端基CH键表现出一些选择性，并涉及链行走过程。
