[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations."

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature."

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d)."

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b)."

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides on silica surfaces. The bis-hydride species is found to be more reactive towards CH4. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but with some differences:

1. Zirconium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures.
- The reaction occurs via a stepwise insertion of deuterium.
- The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation through σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis to regenerate the metal hydride and incorporate deuterium into the alkane.
- The reaction is very fast, even below room temperature.

2. Thorium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures.
- The reaction is fast, with rates of 800-1200 h^-1.
- Slightly selective for terminal CH bonds.
- Overall deuterium incorporation is not selective.
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during H/D exchange.

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
Zirconium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange very rapidly, even at low temperatures. Thorium hydrides also show fast reaction rates (800-1200 h^-1) but exhibit slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds.

Role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking:
For zirconium hydrides, σ-bond metathesis is crucial in the CH bond activation step, followed by hydrogenolysis to complete the H/D exchange. In the case of thorium hydrides, a chain walking mechanism is proposed to explain the cis-trans isomerization observed during H/D exchange, likely involving β-H transfer.

The literature does not provide specific information on alkane metathesis for these systems.

制备和结构：
二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物在二氧化硅表面上制备为单氢化物和双氢化物的混合物。双氢化物对CH4的反应性更高。相比之下，氧化铝负载的钍氢化物是通过在H2下处理脱羟基氧化铝上负载的Th(allyl)4生成的。

催化性质和机理：
两个系统都能催化H/D交换反应，但有一些差异：

1. 锆氢化物：
- 催化H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中的H/D交换。
- 反应通过氘的逐步插入进行。
- 机理涉及两步过程：通过σ键复分解进行CH键活化，形成金属-烷基中间体，然后通过氢解再生金属氢化物并将氘掺入烷烃。
- 反应非常快，即使在室温以下也是如此。

2. 钍氢化物：
- 催化D2/烷烃混合物中的H/D交换。
- 反应速度快，速率为800-1200 h^-1。
- 对端基CH键略有选择性。
- 整体氘掺入不具选择性。
- 二甲基环己烷在H/D交换过程中发生顺反异构。

反应速率和选择性：
锆氢化物即使在低温下也能快速催化H/D交换。钍氢化物也显示出快速的反应速率（800-1200 h^-1），但对端基CH键有轻微的选择性。

σ键复分解、氢解和链行走的作用：
对于锆氢化物，σ键复分解在CH键活化步骤中至关重要，随后的氢解完成H/D交换。对于钍氢化物，提出了链行走机制来解释H/D交换过程中观察到的顺反异构现象，可能涉及β-H转移。

文献中没有提供这些系统的烷烃复分解的具体信息。
