[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations."

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature."

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d)."

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b)."

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides on silica surfaces. The bis-hydride form is more reactive towards CH4. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina with H2.

Catalytic Properties:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions. Zirconium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures, with the H2/D2 exchange being very fast even below room temperature. Thorium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures at high pressure (34 bar of D2) with high rates (800-1200 h-1).

Mechanisms:
For zirconium hydrides, the reaction pathway likely involves a two-step mechanism: 
1) C-H bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate
2) Hydrogenolysis, regenerating the metal hydride and incorporating deuterium in the alkane

For thorium hydrides, the mechanism involves β-H transfer and chain walking, leading to cis-trans isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes during H/D exchange.

Selectivity:
Thorium hydrides show slight selectivity for terminal C-H bonds, but overall, the deuterium incorporation is not selective.

The main differences between the two systems are:
1) The support material (silica vs. alumina)
2) The metal (zirconium vs. thorium)
3) The reaction conditions (zirconium operates at lower temperatures and pressures)
4) The proposed mechanisms (σ-bond metathesis for zirconium vs. β-H transfer and chain walking for thorium)

Both systems demonstrate efficient C-H bond activation through H/D exchange, but they differ in their detailed mechanisms and selectivity patterns.

制备和结构：
硅胶负载的锆氢化物以单氢化物和双氢化物的混合物形式制备在硅胶表面。双氢化物形式对CH4的反应性更高。氧化铝负载的钍氢化物是通过在脱羟基氧化铝上负载Th(allyl)4并用H2处理生成的。

催化性能：
两个体系都能催化H/D交换反应。锆氢化物催化H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中的H/D交换，其中H2/D2交换即使在室温以下也非常快。钍氢化物在高压下（34巴D2）催化D2/烷烃混合物的H/D交换，反应速率高（800-1200 h-1）。

机理：
对于锆氢化物，反应路径可能涉及两步机制：
1) 通过σ键复分解进行C-H键活化，形成金属-烷基中间体
2) 氢解，再生金属氢化物并将氘掺入烷烃

对于钍氢化物，机理涉及β-H转移和链行走，导致H/D交换过程中二甲基环己烷的顺反异构化。

选择性：
钍氢化物对末端C-H键显示出轻微的选择性，但总体上氘的掺入并不选择性。

两个体系的主要区别是：
1) 载体材料（硅胶vs.氧化铝）
2) 金属（锆vs.钍）
3) 反应条件（锆在较低温度和压力下操作）
4) 提出的机理（锆的σ键复分解vs.钍的β-H转移和链行走）

两个体系都通过H/D交换展示了高效的C-H键活化，但它们在详细机理和选择性模式上有所不同。
