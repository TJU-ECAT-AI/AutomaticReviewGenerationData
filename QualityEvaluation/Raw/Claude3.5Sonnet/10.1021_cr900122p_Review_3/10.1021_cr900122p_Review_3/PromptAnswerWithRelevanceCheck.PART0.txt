[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions differ in several aspects:

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride being more reactive. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but with some differences:

1. Zirconium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures
- Operate via a stepwise insertion of deuterium
- The reaction is very fast, even below room temperature
- The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis

2. Thorium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures
- The reaction is fast, with rates of 800-1200 h^-1
- Slightly selective for terminal CH bonds
- Overall deuterium incorporation is not selective
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during the H/D exchange process

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
Zirconium hydrides are described as "very fast" even at low temperatures, while thorium hydrides have specific rates mentioned (800-1200 h^-1). Thorium hydrides show slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds, whereas no specific selectivity is mentioned for zirconium hydrides.

Role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking:
For zirconium hydrides, σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis are explicitly mentioned as key steps in the mechanism. For thorium hydrides, a chain walking mechanism is proposed to explain the cis-trans isomerization observed during H/D exchange.

The literature does not provide specific information about alkane metathesis for these systems.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides both exhibit catalytic activity in C-H bond activation reactions, particularly in H/D exchange processes. However, there are notable differences in their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties.

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared on silica surfaces and exist as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but their mechanisms and properties differ:

1. Zirconium Hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures
- The reaction is very fast, even below room temperature
- The mechanism involves a two-step process:
  a) C-H bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate
  b) Hydrogenolysis, regenerating the metal hydride and incorporating deuterium in the alkane

2. Thorium Hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures
- The reaction is fast, with rates of 800-1200 h^-1
- Slightly selective for terminal C-H bonds
- Overall deuterium incorporation is not selective
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during H/D exchange
- The mechanism likely involves β-H transfer and a chain walking process

While both systems utilize σ-bond metathesis in their mechanisms, the thorium system additionally exhibits chain walking behavior, leading to cis-trans isomerization in certain substrates. The zirconium system's mechanism is more clearly defined, with a specific two-step process involving σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis.

Regarding alkane metathesis, the provided information does not explicitly discuss this process for either system. The focus is primarily on H/D exchange reactions for both catalysts.

In summary, while both silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides are effective catalysts for C-H bond activation in H/D exchange reactions, they differ in their preparation, structure, reaction mechanisms, and selectivity patterns. The zirconium system operates via a well-defined two-step mechanism, while the thorium system shows additional complexity with chain walking processes and cis-trans isomerization.

- 机理涉及两步过程：
  a) 通过σ键复分解进行C-H键活化，形成金属-烷基中间体

- 二甲基环己烷在H/D交换过程中发生顺反异构化
- 机理可能涉及β-H转移和链行走过程

虽然两个系统都在其机理中使用σ键复分解，但钍系统还表现出链行走行为，导致某些底物的顺反异构化。锆系统的机理更加明确定义，具有涉及σ键复分解和氢解的特定两步过程。

关于烷烃复分解，提供的信息并未明确讨论这两个系统的这一过程。两种催化剂的重点主要是H/D交换反应。

总之，虽然二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物都是H/D交换反应中C-H键活化的有效催化剂，但它们在制备、结构、反应机理和选择性模式方面存在差异。锆系统通过明确定义的两步机理运作，而钍系统则显示出额外的复杂性，包括链行走过程和顺反异构化。

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides on silica surfaces. The bis-hydride form is more reactive towards CH4. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina with H2.

Catalytic Properties:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions. Zirconium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures, with the H2/D2 exchange being very fast even below room temperature. Thorium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures at high pressure (34 bar of D2) with high rates (800-1200 h-1).

Mechanisms:
For zirconium hydrides, the reaction pathway likely involves a two-step mechanism: 
1) C-H bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate
2) Hydrogenolysis, regenerating the metal hydride and incorporating deuterium in the alkane

For thorium hydrides, the mechanism involves β-H transfer and chain walking, leading to cis-trans isomerization of dimethylcyclohexanes during H/D exchange.

Selectivity:
Thorium hydrides show slight selectivity for terminal C-H bonds, but overall, the deuterium incorporation is not selective.

The main differences between the two systems are:
1) The support material (silica vs. alumina)
2) The metal (zirconium vs. thorium)
3) The reaction conditions (zirconium operates at lower temperatures and pressures)
4) The proposed mechanisms (σ-bond metathesis for zirconium vs. β-H transfer and chain walking for thorium)

Both systems demonstrate efficient C-H bond activation through H/D exchange, but they differ in their detailed mechanisms and selectivity patterns.
