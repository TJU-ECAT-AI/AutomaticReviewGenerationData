[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

The preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions differ in several aspects:

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides, with the bis-hydride being more reactive. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but with some differences:

1. Zirconium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures
- Operate via a stepwise insertion of deuterium
- The reaction is very fast, even below room temperature
- The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis

2. Thorium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures
- The reaction is fast, with rates of 800-1200 h^-1
- Slightly selective for terminal CH bonds
- Overall deuterium incorporation is not selective
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during the H/D exchange process

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
Zirconium hydrides are described as "very fast" even at low temperatures, while thorium hydrides have specific rates mentioned (800-1200 h^-1). Thorium hydrides show slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds, whereas no specific selectivity is mentioned for zirconium hydrides.

Role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking:
For zirconium hydrides, σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis are explicitly mentioned as key steps in the mechanism. For thorium hydrides, a chain walking mechanism is proposed to explain the cis-trans isomerization observed during H/D exchange.

The literature does not provide specific information about alkane metathesis for these systems.

在C-H键活化反应中，二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质在几个方面存在差异：

制备和结构：
二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是单氢化物和双氢化物的混合物，其中双氢化物反应性更强。氧化铝负载的钍氢化物是通过在H2条件下处理负载在脱羟基氧化铝上的Th(allyl)4生成的。

催化性质和机理：
两个系统都能催化H/D交换反应，但存在一些差异：

1. 锆氢化物：
- 催化H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中的H/D交换
- 通过逐步插入氘进行操作
- 反应非常快，即使在室温以下也是如此
- 机理涉及两步过程：通过σ键复分解进行CH键活化，形成金属-烷基中间体，随后进行氢解

2. 钍氢化物：
- 催化D2/烷烃混合物中的H/D交换
- 反应快速，速率为800-1200 h^-1
- 对末端CH键略有选择性
- 整体氘掺入不具选择性
- 二甲基环己烷在H/D交换过程中发生顺反异构化

反应速率和选择性：
锆氢化物被描述为即使在低温下也"非常快"，而钍氢化物有具体的速率提及（800-1200 h^-1）。钍氢化物对末端CH键显示出略微的选择性，而锆氢化物未提及特定的选择性。

σ键复分解、氢解和链行走的作用：
对于锆氢化物，σ键复分解和氢解被明确提及为机理中的关键步骤。对于钍氢化物，提出了链行走机制来解释H/D交换过程中观察到的顺反异构化。

文献中没有提供这些系统的烷烃复分解的具体信息。
