Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be a correction notice for a previous publication about titanium alkylidene complexes, and does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. There is no information about reaction rates, selectivity, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes for these specific compounds. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有任何关于比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的信息。这份文件似乎是对先前发表的关于钛烷基化合物的出版物的一个更正通知,并没有讨论锆或钍氢化物,它们的制备、结构、催化性质,或在H/D交换和烷烃复分解中的机理。对于这些特定化合物,文献中没有关于反应速率、选择性、σ-键复分解、氢解作用或链行走过程的信息。因此,基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be an addition/correction notice for a different paper about titanium alkylidene complexes. There is insufficient information to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of the specified compounds or to discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. The literature provided does not address reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.
