[1] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."

[2] "According to the IR spectroscopic data, the major hydride species are M(IV) monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH [8,16] and dihydrides (BSiAO)2MH2 [4]."

[3] "The ESR studies [2, 47] revealed that some amount of the M(III) compounds (up to 5% and 30% of the total amount of the supported Zr and Ti, respectively) is also always present in the system."

[4] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides. The rates of ethylene polymerizations on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 were found to be of the same order of magnitude."

[5] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable. In contrast to this, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]) can act as the catalysts of hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."

[6] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is responsible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."

The literature does not provide information to directly compare silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does provide details on the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds and heating under hydrogen at 423 K.

Structure: The system contains a mixture of surface-supported metal hydrides, including:
- Zr(IV) monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH
- Zr(IV) dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2 
- Some Zr(III) compounds, including hydrides

Catalytic properties:
- Active in C-H and C-C bond formation and cleavage under mild conditions
- Catalyze ethylene polymerization, with monohydrides and dihydrides showing similar rates
- Dihydrides can catalyze hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes, while monohydrides cannot
- Show low regioselectivity due to high coordinative unsaturation

Mechanisms: The literature does not provide detailed information on H/D exchange or alkane metathesis mechanisms for these catalysts. It mentions σ-bond metathesis for some steps but does not discuss chain walking.

Reaction rates and selectivity: Quantitative data on rates is not provided, but the catalysts are described as active under mild conditions with low regioselectivity.

The literature does not contain information to compare these properties to alumina-supported thorium hydrides or discuss their specific roles in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis.

该文献没有提供直接比较硅支撑的锆氢化物和氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物的信息。然而,它确实提供了有关硅支撑的锆氢化物的制备、结构和催化性质的详细信息:

制备:硅支撑的锆氢化物是通过将有机金属化合物涂覆在部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上,并在423 K下在氢气中加热制备而成。

结构:该系统包含表面支撑的金属氢化物混合物,包括:
- Zr(IV)单氢化物(≡SiO)3ZrH
- Zr(IV)双氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrH2
- 一些Zr(III)化合物,包括氢化物

催化性质:
- 在温和条件下活跃于C-H和C-C键的形成和断裂
- 催化乙烯聚合,单氢化物和双氢化物显示相似的速率
- 双氢化物可以催化直链烷烃的氢解,而单氢化物不能
- 由于高度配位不饱和,表现出低区域选择性

机理:文献没有提供这些催化剂在H/D交换或烷烃复分解机理方面的详细信息。它提到了一些步骤的σ-键复分解,但没有讨论链行走。

反应速率和选择性:没有提供速率的定量数据,但催化剂被描述为在温和条件下活性,具有低区域选择性。

文献不包含比较这些性质与氧化铝支撑的钍氢化物的信息,也没有讨论它们在H/D交换和烷烃复分解中的具体作用。
