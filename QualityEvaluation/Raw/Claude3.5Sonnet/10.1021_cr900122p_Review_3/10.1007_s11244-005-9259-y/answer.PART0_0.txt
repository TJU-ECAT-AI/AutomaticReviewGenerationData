[1] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."

[2] "Usually, the catalysts are prepared by coating the surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds MR4 (M  Ti, Zr; R  allyl, benzyl [17], neopentyl, etc. [810,15,16]) followed by heating to 423 K under hydrogen."

[3] "According to the IR spectroscopic data, the major hydride species are M(IV) monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH [8,16] and dihydrides (BSiAO)2MH2 [4]."

[4] "Catalytic processes under study were shown to occur involving different surface hydrides. The ethylene polymerization was found to proceed at comparable rates on the zirconium monohydrides, (BSiAO)3ZrH, and dihydrides, (BSiAO)2ZrH2."

[5] "Cleavage of linear alkanes on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable; however, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 can act as catalysts of the process under mild conditions."

[6] "Hydrides of the trivalent zirconium, (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, can also contribute to the hydrogenolysis reaction. A feature of all the systems studied is low regioselectivity of the corresponding processes."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can summarize the information provided about silica-supported zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organozirconium compounds (ZrR4), followed by heating to 423 K under hydrogen.

Structure: The major species are Zr(IV) monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH and dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2. Trivalent zirconium hydrides (≡SiO)2ZrIIIH are also present in smaller amounts.

Catalytic properties: These hydrides catalyze C-H and C-C bond formation and cleavage under mild conditions. They are active in ethylene polymerization and alkane hydrogenolysis.

Mechanisms: The literature does not provide detailed information on H/D exchange mechanisms. For alkane metathesis (hydrogenolysis), the process involves C-H bond activation followed by C-C bond cleavage. σ-bond metathesis is likely involved in these steps.

Reaction rates: Ethylene polymerization proceeds at comparable rates on monohydrides and dihydrides. Hydrogenolysis rates are not explicitly mentioned, but dihydrides are noted to be active under mild conditions.

Selectivity: All systems studied show low regioselectivity in these processes.

Roles of different mechanisms:
- σ-bond metathesis: Likely involved in C-H and C-C bond activation steps.
- Hydrogenolysis: The main process for C-C bond cleavage in alkanes.
- Chain walking: Not explicitly mentioned in the given literature.

The literature emphasizes that different surface hydrides are involved in different catalytic processes. Monohydrides and dihydrides are both active in ethylene polymerization, while dihydrides and trivalent zirconium hydrides are more effective for alkane hydrogenolysis.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，我可以总结一下关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的信息：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将有机锆化合物（ZrR4）涂覆在部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后在氢气中加热到423 K制备而成。

结构：主要物种是Zr(IV)单氢化物(≡SiO)3ZrH和双氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrH2。三价锆氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrIIIH也以较小的量存在。

催化性能：这些氢化物在温和条件下催化C-H和C-C键的形成和断裂。它们在乙烯聚合和烷烃氢解反应中具有活性。

机理：文献没有提供关于H/D交换机理的详细信息。对于烷烃复分解（氢解），该过程涉及C-H键活化，然后是C-C键断裂。σ键复分解可能参与了这些步骤。

反应速率：乙烯聚合在单氢化物和双氢化物上以相当的速率进行。没有明确提到氢解反应的速率，但指出双氢化物在温和条件下具有活性。

选择性：所有研究的体系在这些过程中都表现出低区域选择性。

不同机理的作用：
- σ键复分解：可能参与C-H和C-C键活化步骤。
- 氢解：烷烃C-C键断裂的主要过程。
- 链行走：在给定的文献中没有明确提及。

文献强调不同的表面氢化物参与不同的催化过程。单氢化物和双氢化物在乙烯聚合中都具有活性，而双氢化物和三价锆氢化物在烷烃氢解中更有效。
