[1] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."

[2] "According to the IR spectroscopic data, the major hydride species are M(IV) monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH [8,16] and dihydrides (BSiAO)2MH2 [4]."

[3] "The ESR studies [2, 47] revealed that some amount of the M(III) compounds (up to 5% and 30% of the total amount of the supported Zr and Ti, respectively) is also always present in the system."

[4] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides. The rates of ethylene polymerizations on the monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2 were found to be of the same order of magnitude."

[5] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable. In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]) can act as the catalysts of hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."

[6] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is responsible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."

[7] "The most promising candidates are hydrides of trivalent compounds, (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, which, according to the results obtained in our works [20, 21], also can be efficient catalysts of hydrogenolysis of alkanes."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides or directly compare them to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. Therefore, I cannot make a comprehensive comparison between the two systems as requested in the question. However, I can provide information about the silica-supported zirconium hydrides based on the given text:

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds and heating under hydrogen. The resulting system contains a mixture of surface-supported metal hydrides, including:
1. Zr(IV) monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH
2. Zr(IV) dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2
3. Zr(III) hydrides (≡SiO)2ZrIIIH (in smaller amounts)

Catalytic Properties in C-H Bond Activation:
1. These hydrides catalyze both formation and cleavage of C-H and C-C bonds under mild conditions.
2. They are active in processes such as olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, isotope exchange in alkanes, and hydrogenolysis of alkanes.

Mechanisms:
1. Ethylene Polymerization: Both monohydrides and dihydrides catalyze this process at similar rates.
2. Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes: Dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2 are the main catalysts for this process, while monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH are thermodynamically unfavorable. Zr(III) hydrides may also contribute to hydrogenolysis.

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
1. Ethylene polymerization rates are similar for monohydrides and dihydrides.
2. Hydrogenolysis of alkanes occurs at temperatures reported in experimental studies by Basset et al.
3. The processes show low regioselectivity due to the high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species.

The text does not specifically mention σ-bond metathesis, chain walking, or provide detailed information about H/D exchange mechanisms for these catalysts.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，也没有直接将它们与二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物进行比较。因此，我无法按照问题要求对这两个系统进行全面比较。但是，我可以根据给定的文本提供有关二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的信息：

制备和结构：
二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将有机金属化合物涂覆在部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，并在氢气下加热制备而成。得到的系统包含表面负载金属氢化物的混合物，包括：
1. Zr(IV)单氢化物(≡SiO)3ZrH
2. Zr(IV)双氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrH2
3. Zr(III)氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrIIIH（少量）

C-H键活化的催化性能：
1. 这些氢化物在温和条件下催化C-H和C-C键的形成和断裂。
2. 它们在烯烃聚合、氢化、烷烃同位素交换和烷烃氢解等过程中具有活性。

机理：
1. 乙烯聚合：单氢化物和双氢化物以相似的速率催化这个过程。
2. 烷烃氢解：双氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrH2是这个过程的主要催化剂，而单氢化物(≡SiO)3ZrH在热力学上不利。Zr(III)氢化物也可能对氢解有贡献。

反应速率和选择性：
1. 单氢化物和双氢化物的乙烯聚合速率相似。
2. 烷烃氢解发生在Basset等人实验研究报告的温度下。
3. 由于表面物种具有高度配位不饱和性，这些过程显示出低区域选择性。

文本没有具体提到σ键复分解、链行走，也没有提供这些催化剂的H/D交换机理的详细信息。
