[1] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."

[2] "Usually, the catalysts are prepared by coating the surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds MR4 (M  Ti, Zr; R  allyl, benzyl [17], neopentyl, etc. [810,15,16]) followed by heating to 423 K under hydrogen."

[3] "According to the IR spectroscopic data, the major hydride species are M(IV) monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH [8,16] and dihydrides (BSiAO)2MH2 [4]."

[4] "Catalytic processes under study were shown to occur involving different surface hydrides. The ethylene polymerization was found to proceed at comparable rates on the zirconium monohydrides, (BSiAO)3ZrH, and dihydrides, (BSiAO)2ZrH2."

[5] "Cleavage of linear alkanes on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable; however, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 can act as catalysts of the process under mild conditions."

[6] "Hydrides of the trivalent zirconium, (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, can also contribute to the hydrogenolysis reaction. A feature of all the systems studied is low regioselectivity of the corresponding processes."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can summarize the information provided about silica-supported zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organozirconium compounds (ZrR4), followed by heating to 423 K under hydrogen.

Structure: The major species are Zr(IV) monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH and dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2. Trivalent zirconium hydrides (≡SiO)2ZrIIIH are also present in smaller amounts.

Catalytic properties: These hydrides catalyze C-H and C-C bond formation and cleavage under mild conditions. They are active in ethylene polymerization and alkane hydrogenolysis.

Mechanisms: The literature does not provide detailed information on H/D exchange mechanisms. For alkane metathesis (hydrogenolysis), the process involves C-H bond activation followed by C-C bond cleavage. σ-bond metathesis is likely involved in these steps.

Reaction rates: Ethylene polymerization proceeds at comparable rates on monohydrides and dihydrides. Hydrogenolysis rates are not explicitly mentioned, but dihydrides are noted to be active under mild conditions.

Selectivity: All systems studied show low regioselectivity in these processes.

Roles of different mechanisms:
- σ-bond metathesis: Likely involved in C-H and C-C bond activation steps.
- Hydrogenolysis: The main process for C-C bond cleavage in alkanes.
- Chain walking: Not explicitly mentioned in the given literature.

The literature emphasizes that different surface hydrides are involved in different catalytic processes. Monohydrides and dihydrides are both active in ethylene polymerization, while dihydrides and trivalent zirconium hydrides are more effective for alkane hydrogenolysis.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，我可以总结一下关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的信息：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将有机锆化合物（ZrR4）涂覆在部分脱羟基的二氧化硅上，然后在氢气中加热到423 K制备而成。

结构：主要物种是Zr(IV)单氢化物(≡SiO)3ZrH和双氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrH2。三价锆氢化物(≡SiO)2ZrIIIH也以较小的量存在。

催化性能：这些氢化物在温和条件下催化C-H和C-C键的形成和断裂。它们在乙烯聚合和烷烃氢解反应中具有活性。

机理：文献没有提供关于H/D交换机理的详细信息。对于烷烃复分解（氢解），该过程涉及C-H键活化，然后是C-C键断裂。σ键复分解可能参与了这些步骤。

反应速率：乙烯聚合在单氢化物和双氢化物上以相当的速率进行。没有明确提到氢解反应的速率，但指出双氢化物在温和条件下具有活性。

选择性：所有研究的体系在这些过程中都表现出低区域选择性。

不同机理的作用：
- σ键复分解：可能参与C-H和C-C键活化步骤。
- 氢解：烷烃C-C键断裂的主要过程。
- 链行走：在给定的文献中没有明确提及。

文献强调不同的表面氢化物参与不同的催化过程。单氢化物和双氢化物在乙烯聚合中都具有活性，而双氢化物和三价锆氢化物在烷烃氢解中更有效。

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds and heating under hydrogen at 423 K.

Structure: The system contains a mixture of surface-supported metal hydrides, including:
- Zr(IV) monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH
- Zr(IV) dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2 
- Some Zr(III) compounds, including hydrides

Catalytic properties:
- Active in C-H and C-C bond formation and cleavage under mild conditions
- Catalyze ethylene polymerization, with monohydrides and dihydrides showing similar rates
- Dihydrides can catalyze hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes, while monohydrides cannot
- Show low regioselectivity due to high coordinative unsaturation

Mechanisms: The literature does not provide detailed information on H/D exchange or alkane metathesis mechanisms for these catalysts. It mentions σ-bond metathesis for some steps but does not discuss chain walking.

Reaction rates and selectivity: Quantitative data on rates is not provided, but the catalysts are described as active under mild conditions with low regioselectivity.

The literature does not contain information to compare these properties to alumina-supported thorium hydrides or discuss their specific roles in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法直接比较。但是，我可以总结一下关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的信息：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将部分脱羟基的二氧化硅涂覆有机金属化合物（ZrR4，其中R可以是烯丙基、苄基、新戊基等），然后在氢气中加热至423 K制备而成。

The given literature does not contain any information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides or their catalytic properties. The document focuses exclusively on silica-supported zirconium hydrides and their catalytic behavior in ethylene polymerization and hydrogenolysis of alkanes. It does not discuss thorium-based catalysts, alumina supports, or provide any comparative analysis between zirconium and thorium systems. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or contrast between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides based on this document.

The literature does describe some aspects of C-H bond activation by zirconium hydrides, including their role in alkane hydrogenolysis. However, it does not specifically discuss H/D exchange reactions or alkane metathesis. The document mentions σ-bond metathesis in the context of alkyl/hydride exchange reactions, but does not go into detail about chain walking processes. 

Without additional information about thorium-based systems, it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons regarding reaction rates, selectivity, or mechanistic details between the two catalyst types based solely on this document.

给定的文献不包含任何关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物或其催化性质的信息。该文档专门讨论了二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物及其在乙烯聚合和烷烃氢解中的催化行为。它没有讨论基于钍的催化剂、氧化铝载体,也没有提供锆和钍系统之间的任何比较分析。因此,我无法根据这份文件对二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物进行比较或对比。

文献确实描述了锆氢化物在C-H键活化方面的一些特性,包括它们在烷烃氢解中的作用。然而,它没有具体讨论H/D交换反应或烷烃复分解。该文档在烷基/氢交换反应的背景下提到了σ键复分解,但没有详细讨论链行走过程。

没有关于基于钍的系统的额外信息,仅根据这份文件无法对两种催化剂类型之间的反应速率、选择性或机理细节进行有意义的比较。

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides or directly compare them to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. Therefore, I cannot make a comprehensive comparison between the two systems as requested in the question. However, I can provide information about the silica-supported zirconium hydrides based on the given text:

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds and heating under hydrogen. The resulting system contains a mixture of surface-supported metal hydrides, including:
1. Zr(IV) monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH

1. Ethylene Polymerization: Both monohydrides and dihydrides catalyze this process at similar rates.
2. Hydrogenolysis of Alkanes: Dihydrides (≡SiO)2ZrH2 are the main catalysts for this process, while monohydrides (≡SiO)3ZrH are thermodynamically unfavorable. Zr(III) hydrides may also contribute to hydrogenolysis.

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
1. Ethylene polymerization rates are similar for monohydrides and dihydrides.
2. Hydrogenolysis of alkanes occurs at temperatures reported in experimental studies by Basset et al.
3. The processes show low regioselectivity due to the high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species.
