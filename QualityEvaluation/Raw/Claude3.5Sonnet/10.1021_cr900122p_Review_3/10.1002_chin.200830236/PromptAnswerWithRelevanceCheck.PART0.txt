Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

Unfortunately, this abstract does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The abstract does not discuss the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of these specific compounds, nor does it mention their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. There is no information about reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking for these catalysts. The abstract appears to be a brief overview of a review article on olefin and alkane metathesis heterogeneous catalysts, but does not provide any specific details that would answer the given question.

很遗憾,这篇摘要并不包含任何关于比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的相关信息。摘要没有讨论这些特定化合物的制备、结构或催化性质,也没有提到它们在H/D交换或烷烃复分解中的机理。没有关于这些催化剂的反应速率、选择性或σ-键复分解、氢解和链行走作用的信息。这篇摘要似乎是一篇关于烯烃和烷烃复分解多相催化剂的综述文章的简要概述,但没有提供任何能回答给定问题的具体细节。
