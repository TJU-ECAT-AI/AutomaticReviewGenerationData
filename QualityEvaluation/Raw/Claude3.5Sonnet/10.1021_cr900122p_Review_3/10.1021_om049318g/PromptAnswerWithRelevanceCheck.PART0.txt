Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be a brief citation or reference to an article about intramolecular C-H activation reactions involving titanium neopentylidene compounds. It does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, or catalytic properties. There is also no information about H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, reaction rates, selectivity, or mechanisms such as σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

所提供的文献中没有任何关于比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的信息。这段文字似乎是一篇关于钛新戊叉化合物的分子内C-H活化反应的文章的简短引用或参考。它没有讨论锆或钍氢化物，它们的制备、结构或催化性质。文中也没有关于H/D交换、烷烃复分解、反应速率、选择性或σ-键复分解、氢解和链行走等机制的信息。因此，根据给定的文献无法回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be a brief citation for an article about intramolecular C-H activation reactions involving titanium neopentylidene complexes, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is no information provided about the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of zirconium or thorium hydrides, nor any details about their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis reactions. The document does not discuss reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the given literature.
