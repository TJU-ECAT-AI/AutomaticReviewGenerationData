Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

This document does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The text focuses on rhenium-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes. It does not discuss C-H bond activation reactions involving zirconium or thorium catalysts, their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis, or concepts like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The question cannot be answered using the information provided in this document.

This document does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The text primarily discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes using rhenium polyhydride complexes. It does not mention zirconium, thorium, silica or alumina supports, or the specific mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, I cannot answer the question based on the information provided in this document.

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The text primarily discusses the catalytic dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes using soluble rhenium polyhydride systems. There is no mention of the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of the specific metal hydrides mentioned in the question. The document also does not discuss C-H bond activation reactions, H/D exchange, or alkane metathesis involving these catalysts. As such, I cannot provide a comparison or contrast of these systems or detail their mechanisms based on the information given in this literature.
