Abstract
Adsorptions of methane, ethane and pentane on the -alumina (110C) surface are investigated with semi-empirical (PM3) cluster calculations. It
is found that the abstraction of an H atom accompanied by the formation of a CO bond is the most favorable reaction for methane on the alumina
surface. For ethane and pentanealumina interactions, the abstraction of two H atoms accompanied by the formation of an alkene is the most
favorable reaction. The surface Al atoms help to promote the reactions, but are not directly involved in the bond formation.

1. Introduction
The interpretation of H/D exchange between surface OH-
groups of a metal oxide and CD4 as an indication of strong
Br
onsted acidity [14] was questioned by Engelhardt et al. [5,6],
who proposed an alternative explanation that H/D exchange
could be initiated by dissociative methane chemisorption over
Lewis acidLewis base pair sites. Such chemisorption would
produce the surface species CD3and D+, with the CD3
moiety bound to a valence unsaturated Al atom of Lewis acid
character.
The Lewis acidity of surface Al sites on -alumina has
been the subject of several previous investigations [79], as
has the reactivity of these sites with water [1012], hydrogen
sulfide [10], carbon monoxide [10], ammonia [11], pyridine
[11], and methanol [13]. Previously we applied theoretical
calculations to gain insight into the interaction of 1-hexene
with -alumina, and found the interaction to be purely repul-
sive at valence unsaturated surface Al sites [14]. By contrast,
investigations of the interactions of simple alcohols with -

alumina showed participation of the surface Lewis acid sites
[15].
Herein we report the results of calculations designed to inves-
tigate the adsorption of methane, ethane and pentane on the -
alumina (110C) surface. Two cluster models, H8Al40O64 (which
exposes an AlO terminated face on the hydrogen-spinel form of
-alumina) and Al48O72 (which exposes an oxygen terminated
face on the hydrogen-free defect-spinel form of -alumina),
were used to model the -alumina surface. By employing mod-
els with different degrees of hydrogenation we can explore
the temperature dependence of the reactivity of -alumina as
a heterogeneous catalyst. We found that on both models, the
most energetically favorable first reaction step for methane is H
abstraction from the carbon (C1) position, with C1 bonding to a
surface oxygen. (Note: atomic labels are C1C2C3C4C5 for
pentane, C1C2 for ethane and C1 for methane. Hn refers to the
H atoms bonding to Cn.) For ethane and pentane, the most ener-
getically favorable first reaction step is the dehydrogenation of
two H atoms from different carbon atoms. In pentanealumina
interactions, the two H atoms are abstracted from C2 and
C3, respectively, producing 2-pentene. Under certain conditions
these reactions can be exothermic. The lowest energy barriers to
these reactions are around 6070 kcal/mol on H8Al40O64 model
and around 2637 kcal/mol on Al48O72 model.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
