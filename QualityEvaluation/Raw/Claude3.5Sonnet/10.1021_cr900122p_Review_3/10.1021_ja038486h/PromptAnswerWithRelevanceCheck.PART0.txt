Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to answer the question about comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be only a title and author list for a scientific article about zirconium hydrides on silica surfaces, without providing any detailed content about their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms. There is no information at all about thorium hydrides or alumina supports. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a meaningful comparison or discussion of the requested topics based solely on this limited information.

给出的文献不包含足够的信息来回答关于比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的问题。该文档似乎只是一篇关于二氧化硅表面锆氢化物的科学文章的标题和作者列表，没有提供有关它们的制备、结构、催化性能或机理的详细内容。文中完全没有关于钍氢化物或氧化铝载体的信息。因此，仅凭这些有限的信息无法对所要求的主题进行有意义的比较或讨论。

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to answer the question about comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document appears to be only a title and author list for a scientific article about surface zirconium hydrides on silica, but does not provide any details about their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms. There is no mention of thorium hydrides or alumina supports. Without access to the full text of the article or additional relevant sources, it is not possible to provide a meaningful comparison of these catalytic systems or discuss their roles in C-H activation reactions.
