Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document primarily focuses on silica-supported tantalum hydride complexes, their preparation, characterization, and reactivity. It does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their mechanisms in H/D exchange, or alkane metathesis reactions. The literature also does not provide information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the specific roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes for the requested metal hydride systems. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided document.

The provided literature does not contain information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document mainly discusses the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride complex. It does not provide any information about zirconium or thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, or catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document also does not discuss mechanisms of H/D exchange or alkane metathesis for these complexes. There is no information about reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking for zirconium or thorium hydride complexes.

The given document does not contain information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The text primarily focuses on silica-supported tantalum hydrides and their properties. Without relevant information about zirconium or thorium hydrides, it is not possible to compare and contrast their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties with the tantalum hydrides described in the document. The question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in this literature.
