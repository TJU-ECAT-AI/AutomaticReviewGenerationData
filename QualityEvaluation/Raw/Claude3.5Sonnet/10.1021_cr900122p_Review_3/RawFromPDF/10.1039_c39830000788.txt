Selective catalytic dehydrogenation (up to 9 turnovers) of cycloalkanes CnHZn 
(n = 6, 7, and 8) to the 
corresponding cycloalkenes is achieved, under mild conditions (30-80 
"C), using dilute (ca. 3 mM) solutions 
of the bis(ph0sphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar3P),ReH7 (Ar = p-F-C6H4, 
Ph, and p-Me-C,H,) 
in the 
cycloalkane, with an olefin as the hydrogen acceptor. 
A few soluble transition metal systems have recently been dis- 
covered which, when activated either thermally1~2 
(e.g., by 
reaction with an olefin which removes two or more hydride 
ligands) or photochemically3 (e.g., by dissociation of H, or 
CO), afford highly reactive, co-ordinatively unsaturated, 
intermediates capable of inserting into alkane C-H bonds. 
Thus, the key step in the conversion of cycloalkanes C,H,, 
(n = 6, 7, and 8) into the corresponding cycloalkenes using 
the bis(ph0sphine)rhenium heptahydrides (Ar,P),ReH, (la-c), 
in the presence of 3,3-dimethylbut-l-ene (2) as a hydrogen 
acceptor, is thought to involve the insertion of a 14e inter- 
mediate such as (Ar3P),ReH3 into a C-H bond of the cyclo-

Consideration of the various possible reactions occurring in 
this system suggested to us that the dehydrogenation of 
cycloalkanes might be made catalytic [with respect to (l)] 
simply by using low concentrations of the reagents (1) and (2). 
We now report that this is indeed the case.

7 We have recently re-examined these reactions and found that, 
in some cases, the yields of cycloalkenes are higher than those we 
reported previously [30--80% based on ( 
1)12 
especially in reactions 
involving the heptahydride (la), which now appears to be a more 
efficient reagent than both (lb) and (lc). 
The reasons for this dis- 
parity, which may be due to use of purer starting materials 
[hydrocarbon or (l)] 
or to subtle differences in experimental pro- 
cedure, will be discussed in our full paper.

Our best results have been obtained with the heptahydride 
(la) and cyclo-octane. This system is far more reactive than 
we previously suspected. Thus, when a pale buff, deoxygen- 
ated, solution of (la) (3.3 mM) and the olefin (2) (50 mM) in 
cyclo-octane was made up at ca. 20 "C and then placed in a 
bath preheated to 30 "C, within 5 min the colour had changed 
to pale amber and cyclo-octene (0.7 mM, 0.2 turnover) had 
already been formed. After 10 min, the concentration of cyclo- 
octene had reached its maximum (5.3 mM, 1.6 turnovers). 
This system therefore functions catalytically even at 30 "C. 
The number of turnovers was greater [9 mol of cyclo-octenez 
per mol of (la) 
after 10 min] when the bath was preheated to 
80 "C. Under similar conditions (bath preheated to 80 "C), 
cyclohexane gave cyclohexenef (3.2 turnovers) and cyclo- 
heptane gave cycloheptene (4 turnovers). The heptahydrides 
(lb)4 and (1c)j were rather less effective [e.g., 
cyclo-octene, 6 
turnovers using (lb), cyclohexene, 1.4 turnovers using (lc)]. 
$ In these experiments, the cycloalkene was identified by g.c.-m.s. 
In the others, identification 
of the products was by g.c. retention 
times. The yields were determined by g.c.

All these reactions were totally selective; no other dehydro- 
genation products (e.g., benzene from cyclohexane) could be 
detected. 
The relatively large free energy of hydrogenation of the 
olefin (2) 
(21.9 kcal/mo16) 
(1 kcal = 4.1 
8 kJ) is not a determin- 
ing factor in these reactions, since the dehydrogenation of 
cyclo-octane [using (la)] was still catalytic (5 turnovers 
instead of 9) with cyclohexene (free energy of hydrogenation 
18.7 kcal/moP) as the hydrogen acceptor instead of (2). 
Methylcyclohexane gave a mixture of olefins. The results 
(Table I )  are interesting for several reasons: (a) they show that 
the various olefins, once formed, are not all interconverted by 
these rhenium hydride systems, since 1 
-methylcyclohexene 
(the most stable of the four isomers7) is present in no more 
than trace amounts; (b) they show that radical intermediates 
cannot be involved, since the major products (3- and 4- 
methylcyclohexene) cannot have arisen from the tertiary 
I-methylcyclohexyl radical which would have been formed 
preferentially in a radical process;8 
(c) they show that adventi- 
tious traces of a rhenium colloid cannot be responsible for 
these dehydrogenations, since a common intermediate such as 
this would have led to the formation of the same mixture of 
olefins from all three heptahydrides; and (d) they suggest that 
the ‘intrinsic’ reactivity sequence is Me > 
CH, > CH, and 
that this is counteracted by a strong steric effect which directs 
the reagents, especially those containing bulky phosphines 
(Ar,P), away from the more hindered sites (i.e., Me, 2-CH,, 
and 6-CH2 in methylcyclohexane). 
Even though the total number of turnovers achieved by this 
system under present conditions is limited, the results reported 
here establish for the first time that the selective, non-radical, 
catalytic functionalisation of an unstrained hydrocarbon by 
means of a soluble transition-metal catalyst is a feasible 
process.
