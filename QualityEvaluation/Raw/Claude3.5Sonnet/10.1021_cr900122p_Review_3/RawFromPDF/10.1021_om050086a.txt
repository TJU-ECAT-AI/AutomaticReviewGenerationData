Abstract
The molecular complex [W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)3], 1, reacts with SiO2-(700) to give as major species 2a, [(⋮SiO)W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], while a bisgrafted surface species 3a, [(⋮SiO)2W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)], is obtained on SiO2-(200). As in molecular organometallic chemistry, the alkylalkylidyne tautomeric form is favored. Despite these structural features, these surface organometallic complexes are very active olefin metathesis catalysts, as reported earlier, and it is very likely that the necessary metallocarbene intermediates are generated under the reaction conditions.

Synopsis
The molecular complex [W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] reacts with SiO2-(700) to give [(⋮SiO)W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as the major surface species, while a bisgrafted surface species, [(⋮SiO)2W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)], is obtained on SiO2-(200). As in molecular organometallic chemistry, the alkylalkylidyne tautomeric form is favored. Despite these structural features, these surface organometallic complexes are very active olefin metathesis catalysts, as reported earlier, and it is very likely that the necessary metallocarbene intermediates are generated under the reaction conditions.
Introduction
The reaction of molecular organometallic complexes with partially dehydroxylated silica aims at generating supported catalysts. Early studies focused first on preparing supported metal alkyl complexes for polymerization catalysis. 1-3 An important aspect of this field is to understand the reaction of organometallic complexes with the surface of supports in order to control the coordination sphere of the grafted metal, with the goal to undertake a more rational development of heterogeneous catalysts through structure−activity relationships. This requires a precise definition of the active sites, which is one of the goals of surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). 4,5 In the past few years, we have shown that the reaction of an organometallic complex with silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C (SiO2-(700)) yields the replacement of one of the M−C bonds by a M−OSi bond. 6-9 In this way, well-defined monosiloxy surface complexes are obtained, and in these cases silica can be compared to a bulky η1 ligand. 10 Moreover, by using lower temperatures of pretreatment, e.g., 200 °C, it is possible to increase the number of bonds between the metal and the support, and bisgrafted species can also be selectively obtained as the result of the cleavage of two M−C bonds by surface silanols. 10-13
In the attempt to generate well-defined metallocarbene surface complexes for olefin metathesis single-site heterogeneous catalysts, it was proposed that metallocarbynes, [W(⋮CtBu)X3] with X = CH2tBu, OtBu, or Cl, could generate metallocarbenes via their protonation with a surface silanol. 14,15 In fact, these materials proved to be highly active olefin metathesis catalysts without the use of activators such as Lewis acids. Later studies showed that they were quite structurally complex and that several metallocarbene species were probably present. 15,16 We have recently investigated the reactivity of [Mo(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)3], a metallocarbyne, with SiO2-(700) and showed that the metallocarbyne functionality was preserved after grafting.6
Here we have investigated the reactivity of [W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] 17 with SiO2-(200) and SiO2-(700), and the two different resulting species have been characterized at the molecular level by using solid-state NMR techniques and both are found to contain the metallocarbyne unit intact.
Results and Discussions
In-Situ IR Study. When an excess of [W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)3], 1, is sublimed at 80 °C on a SiO2-(700) disk, the disk immediately turns pale yellow, and the band attributed to isolated silanol ν(OH) groups at 3747 cm-1 totally disappears from the IR spectrum (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). A broad band of very weak intensity appears at lower wavenumbers (3740−3550 cm-1), in agreement with the presence of a small amount of residual silanols (10% with respect to the amount of silanols measured by IR spectroscopy on SiO2-(700)). Concomitantly, two groups of bands appear in the 3000−2700 and 1500−1300 cm-1 regions, which are assigned to ν(CH) and δ(CH) vibrations of perhydrocarbyl ligands (probably bonded to tungsten). When 1 is grafted on a SiO2-(200) disk (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), the same phenomena are observed, with the main difference being the presence of a larger amount of remaining silanols (60%, vide infra for further comments), which are probably interacting with perhydrocarbyl ligands (attached to W).
The irreversible disappearance of the free silanols' stretching band, the appearance of ν(CH) and δ(CH) bands, and the presence of tBuCH3 in the gas phase are in full agreement with a chemical grafting of W on silica.
Mass Balance Analyses. To establish the mass balance of the reaction of 1 with silica, the reaction was first carried out by impregnation of silica in a pentane solution of 1 (Table 1, entries 1, 3, and 4).

First, note the W loading is relatively low and that increasing reaction time increases the W loading (entries 3 and 4). This is quite different from what has been observed for other perhydrocarbyl metal complexes (Zr, Ta, Mo, and Re), which graft within 30 min to 1 h under similar reaction conditions. In fact, 0.12−0.19 mmol of W/g of silica is grafted while the concentration of silanols is about 0.26 mmol OH/g on SiO2-(700). Similarly, the W loading is relatively low on SiO2-(200) (0.18 mmol of W/g of silica) considering that SiO2-(200) contains 0.86 mmol OH/g,11 which implies that W loading could be up to 15.2%wt if one considers the grafting of one W per surface OH group (vide infra for further comments).
Changing the grafting method to the reaction of 1 and SiO2 as a mechanical mixture maintained at 70 °C (Table 1, entries 2 and 5) substantially increases the W loading (solventless impregnation method). First, in the case of SiO2-(700), the W loading can be increased up to 4.4%wt (Table 1, entry 3), which corresponds to 0.24 mmol of W/g of silica. This shows that about 95% of the silanols have been consumed during the grafting process under these conditions, consistent with what has been observed by IR spectroscopy. During this step, 0.9 equiv of tBuCH3 per grafted W is formed, and the solid obtained, 2, contains around 2.9−3.1 “neopentyl-like” ligands according to elemental analysis and hydrogenolysis. A similar mass balance is also observed when grafting is performed in a pentane solution. All these data are therefore consistent with the formation of a monografted surface complex as a major species, which can be tentatively formulated as [(⋮SiO)W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], 2a, or [(⋮SiO)W(CHtBu)2(CH2tBu)], 2b (Scheme 1). Second, in the case of SiO2-(200), this solventless impregnation method also gives a yellow solid, 3, with a higher W loading, ca. 6.4%wt, that is 0.35 mmol of W/g of silica. Note however that 1.8 equiv of tBuCH3/grafted W is formed, which is consistent with the formation of a bisgrafted surface complex as a major species. 18 Conversely, 0.65 (1.8 × 0.35) mmol of OH/g of silica has been consumed, while SiO2-(200) contains 0.86 mmol OH/g, and therefore some OH groups (25%) have not been consumed during this process. This is somewhat different from what we observed by IR spectroscopy (60% remaining silanols assuming a similar extinction coefficient for free silanols and those in interaction), which shows that their extinction coefficients are in fact quite different. Independently of the method of preparation, the 2,2-dimethylpropane evolved during grafting, carbon elemental analysis, and hydrogenolysis of the solid are consistent with a bisgrafted W complex surrounded by an average of 2.1 neopentyl-like ligands. The structure of the major species can be tentatively formulated as [(⋮SiO)2W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)], 3a, or [(⋮SiO)2W(CHtBu)2], 3b (Scheme 1).

In conclusion, we note that in molecular chemistry, d0-2 bis-alkylidene complexes are rare 19-26 and generally only the alkylalkylidyne tautomeric form is observed. Thus, 2b/3b would be unexpected, but would explain the olefin metathesis activity of such systems. In contrast, 2a/3a would be more consistent with molecular chemistry, although olefin metathesis requires metallocarbene intermediates. To determine which molecular structure is present on SiO2-(200) and SiO2-(700), solid-state NMR spectroscopy was performed.
Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy. On one hand, the solid-state 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of 2 displays three barely resolved signals at 1.1, 1.45, and 2.0 ppm (Figure S3a), while there are only two signals, at 32 and 95 ppm, in the solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum (Figure 1a). On the other hand, the 1H MAS spectrum of solid 3 shows a single broad signal centered at 1.1 ppm (Figure S3b), while the 13C CP/MAS spectrum contains four signals at 32, 52, 95, and 318 ppm. In this case, they can be tentatively assigned to C(CH3)3, C(CH3)3, (CH2tBu), and (⋮CtBu) resonances, respectively (see Table 2 and Figure 1b).
Figure 1 (a) CP/MAS 13C NMR spectrum of 2. The spectrum was recorded with 70 000 scans, a relaxation delay of 1 s, and a CP contact time of 10 ms. An exponential line broadening of 100 Hz was applied before Fourier transform. (b) CP/MAS 13C NMR of 3. The spectrum was recorded with 70 000 scans, a relaxation delay of 1 s, and a CP contact time of 10 ms. An exponential line broadening of 100 Hz was applied before Fourier transform.
Due to lower loading of W on SiO2-(700) the 13C signal-to-noise ratio of 2 is significantly lower than 3, preventing the observation of the two other expected signals (vide infra). However, the somewhat narrower lines obtained for the 1H MAS spectrum of 2, SiO2-(700), is consistent with a greater mobility of the monosiloxy species 2a/b (around the W−OSi bond) compared to the bissiloxy species 3a/b of solid 3 (possibly due to greater dipolar interactions in the latter case).
To obtain higher quality 13C spectra, the complex 1*, 13C labeled on the carbons attached directly to W, was prepared and grafted on SiO2-(200) and SiO2-(700). While the 1H MAS spectra of 2* [1*/SiO2-(700)] and 3* [1*/SiO2-(200)] are similar to those of 2 and 3, their 13C CP/MAS spectra are noteworthy:  the spectrum of 2* [1*/SiO2-(700)] now shows an extra signal at 318 ppm (Figure 2a), consistent with a neopentylidyne ligand. The spectrum of 3* [1*/SiO2-(200)] shows the same signals at 32, 52, 95, and 318 ppm (Figure 2b), as already observed without labeling, but the intensities of those at 95 and 318 ppm dramatically increase, which is consistent with their assignments to the 13C-enriched carbons directly attached to the metal, i.e., the (W-CH2tBu) and (⋮CtBu), respectively. Note that the signal at 318 ppm is more easily detected when a direct single 13C pulse acquisition is used (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), as already observed in the case of [(⋮SiO)Re(⋮CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2].7 Note that similar features are also obtained for the solid-state NMR of 1 (Figures S5 and S6), which shows the dramatic influence of the chemical shift anisotropy on the carbynic carbons compared to the methylene of the neopentyl ligand.

Moreover, the assignments are confirmed by 2D 1H−13C HETCOR solid-state NMR spectroscopy,6,9,27 for which short contact times (1 ms) have been chosen in order to detect only the protons directly attached to a carbon. Under these conditions, the 2D HETCOR spectrum of 2* shows three strong correlations between proton and carbon signals (δ 1H; δ 13C): (1.2; 32), (1.1; 95), and (2.0; 95 ppm) (Figure 3). No correlation is observed for the 13C signals at 318 and 52 ppm, consistent with their assignment to quaternary carbons. The correlation at (1.2; 32) can be assigned to the methyls of the two types of tBu groups (traces in Figure 3b). Moreover, the methylene group of the neopentyl ligands (CH2tBu, 95 ppm) gives two correlations with protons at 1.1 and 2.0 ppm (traces in Figure 3c), which can be assigned to the two diastereotopic protons. In fact, these data are very similar to what has been observed for the corresponding Mo derivatives, [⋮SiOMo(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)2]6 or similar W complexes.21,24,28-31
Figure 3 (a) 1H−13C HETCOR spectrum of solid 2*. The spectra were recorded with 4096 scans, a relaxation delay of 1 s, and a CP contact time of 1 ms. An exponential line broadening of 50 Hz was applied before Fourier transform. Traces perpendicular to F2 at (b) 32 ppm and (c) 95 ppm.
The 2D 1H−13C HETCOR NMR spectrum of 3* recorded with a contact time of 1 ms (Figure S7) also shows three strong correlations: (1.1 ppm, 32 ppm), assigned to the methyl of all the tBu fragments, as well as the two correlations between the methylene carbon signal at 95 ppm (CH2tBu) and two protons at 1.1 and 2.0 ppm. As for 2*, no correlation is also observed with the quaternary carbons. In the case of SiO2-(700), we have assigned the two different protons at 1.1 and 2.0 ppm to diastereotopic protons. In the case of SiO2-(200), the presence of two different proton signals also implies that the two protons are not equivalent, which would arise from (i) the heterogeneity of the silica surface (the two siloxy substituents are not equivalent), (ii) the rigidity of the neopentyl ligand (no free motion around the M−C bond because of the surface ligands or the interaction of one of the methylidene proton with the metal center (agostic interaction)), 32 or (iii) the assignment of one of the protons to a different species (Scheme 2). For (iii), residual silanols (25%), observed around 2.0 ppm (typically at 1.8 ppm), could correlate with the carbon at 95 ppm. However, when 1* is grafted on a deuterated SiO2-(200), no major difference is observed in the 1H spectrum, and the same correlations are observed in its 2D 1H−13C HETCOR solid-state NMR spectrum (Supporting Information, Figure S8). Therefore, the two correlations at 1.1 and 2.0 ppm in the F1 dimension (1H) with the signal at 95 ppm in the F2 dimension (13C) correspond indeed to two inequivalent protons.
Scheme 2
Finally, J-resolved 2D solid-state NMR spectroscopy33-37 has been performed on 2* and 3* (Figures 4 and S9 in the Supporting Information). In both cases, no signal is detected for the carbynic carbons, because of the low signal-to-noise ratio. For 2* and 3*, the singlet at 52 ppm is assigned to the quarternary carbon of the tBu group attached to the carbynic carbon, and the quadruplet (tBu, 1JC-H = 125 Hz) at 32 ppm is fully consistent with its assignments to the methyl of the tBu groups. The triplet (CH2tBu, 1JC-H = 110 Hz) at 95 ppm is assigned to the methylene carbon of the neopentyl fragment, and the low 1JC-H value for the methylene is indicative of a weak agostic interaction of these protons with the metal center.32

Scheme 3.  Possible Formation of the Initiation Carbene Ligands from an Alkylidyne
Activity in Olefin Metathesis. Moreover, despite the absence of the necessary alkylidene ligands, the metathesis activity is quite high and similar to that observed previously:15,16 1600 equiv of propene in the presence of 2 is converted at room temperature into a thermodynamic mixtures of propene, ethylene, and 2-butenes within 180 min (ca. 35% conv in propene). The initial rate after 5 min is 36 TON/min, which is close to that observed previously (15 TON/min). Additionnally, the surface organometallic complex 2 also catalyzes the metathesis of methyl oleate:  100 equiv is converted to the equilibrium mixtures within 200 min with an initial rate of 0.6 TON/min. Therefore, this system can be used as a precursor for olefin metathesis, and the carbene ligand is probably generated in situ either by H-transfer from an alkyl ligand to generate a bis-alkylidene or by direct metathesis of an olefin with an alkylidyne, which generates in turn a propagating ligand (Scheme 3).
Conclusion
According to mass balance analysis, IR, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy techniques, the molecular complex 1 reacts with SiO2-(700) to give 2a, [(⋮SiO)W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)2], as the major surface species, while a bisgrafted surface species 3a, [(⋮SiO)2W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)], is obtained on SiO2-(200) (Scheme 1). As in molecular organometallic chemistry, the alkylalkylidyne tautomeric form is favored.
Despite these structural features, these surface organometallic complexes are very active olefin metathesis catalysts, as reported earlier, and it is very likely that the necessary metallocarbene intermediates are generated under the reaction conditions.
Experimental Section
General Procedure. All experiments were carried out under controlled atmosphere, using Schlenk and glovebox techniques for the organometallic synthesis. For the synthesis and treatments of the surface species, reactions were carried out using high-vacuum lines (1.34 Pa) and glovebox techniques. [W(⋮CtBu)(CH2tBu)3] was prepared according to the literature procedure.17 Pentane was distilled on NaK alloy and degassed through freeze−pump−thaw cycles. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 550 FT spectrometer equipped with a cell designed for in situ reactions under controlled atmosphere. Elemental analyses were performed at the Service Central d'Analyses of CNRS in Solaize.
1H MAS and 13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DSX-300 spectrometer. For specific studies (see below), 1H MAS and 13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance-500 spectrometers with a conventional double-resonance 4 mm CP-MAS probe at the Laboratoire de Chimie in Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon or at the Laboratoire de Chimie Organometallique de Surface in Ecole Supérieure de Chimie Physique Electronique de Lyon. The samples were introduced under Ar in a zirconia rotor, which was then tightly closed. In all experiments, the rotation frequency was set to 10 kHz unless otherwise specified. Chemical shifts were given with respect to TMS as external reference for 1H and 13C NMR.
Heteronuclear Correlation Spectroscopy. The two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation experiment was performed according to the following scheme:  90° proton pulse, t1 evolution period, cross-polarization (CP) to carbon spins, detection of carbon magnetization. For the CP step, a ramp radio frequency (rf) field38,39 centered at 60 kHz was applied on protons, while the carbon rf field was matched to obtain optimal signal. The contact time for CP was set to 1 ms. During acquisition, the proton decoupling field strength was set to 83 kHz (TPPM decoupling). 40 A total of 32 t1 increments with 1024 scans each were collected. The spinning frequency was 10 kHz, and the recycle delay was 1 s (total acquisition time of 9 h). Quadrature detection in ω1 was achieved using the TPPI method. 41
J-Resolved Spectroscopy. The two-dimensional J-resolved experiment was performed as previously described:37 after cross-polarization from protons, carbon magnetization evolves during t1 under proton homonuclear decoupling. Simultaneous 180° carbon and proton pulses are applied in the middle of t1 to refocus the carbon chemical shift evolution while retaining the modulation by the heteronuclear JCH scalar couplings. A Z-filter is finally applied to allow phase-sensitive detection in ω1. Proton homonuclear decoupling was performed by using the frequency-switched Lee−Goldburg (FSLG) decoupling sequence. 42,43 Quadrature detection in ω1 was achieved using the TPPI method.41 The rotor spinning frequency was 10.2 kHz. The proton rf field strength was set to 83 kHz during t1 (FSLG decoupling) and acquisition (TPPM decoupling).40 The lengths of carbon and proton 180° pulses were 7 and 6 μs, respectively. An experimental scaling factor, measured as already described, 44 of 0.52 was found, which gave a corrected spectral width of 2452 Hz in the ω1 dimension. The recycle delay was 1.3 s, and a total of 80 t1 increments with 1024 scans each were collected (total acquisition time = 30 h).
Preparation of SiO2-(200) and SiO2-(700). Silica Aerosil from Degussa with a specific area of 200 m2/g was dehydroxylated directly at 200 °C for 12 h for SiO2-(200) or at 500 °C for 12 h and at 700 °C for 4 h for SiO2-(700) under high vacuum (10-5 mmHg). After this treatment, the specific area was about 200 m2/g and 180 m2/g with an OH density of 2.5 OH/nm2 and 0.7 OH/nm2, respectively for SiO2-(200) and SiO2-(700).
Preparation of 2 by Impregnation in Pentane. General Procedure. A mixture of 1 (115 mg, 0.247 mmol) and SiO2-(700) (0.8 g) in pentane (10 mL) was stirred at 25 °C for 4 h. After filtration, the solid was washed three times with pentane and all volatile compounds were condensed into another reactor (volume known > 6 L) in order to quantify 2,2-dimethylpropane evolved during the grafting. The resulting yellow powder (solid 2) was dried under vacuum (1.34 Pa).
Synthesis of 3 by Impregnation in Pentane. The same procedure as the one described above was used: 1 (600 mg, 1.25 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and SiO2-(200) (1.8 g), giving 2.1 g of solid 3 (see Tables 1 and 2).
Preparation of Solid 2 by Solventless Impregnation. General Procedure.A mixture of 1 (68 mg, 0.14 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and SiO2-(700) (444 mg) was stirred at 66 °C for 4 h. All volatile compounds were condensed into another reactor (of known volume) in order to quantify 2,2-dimethylpropane evolved during grafting. Analysis of the gas phase by GC on a KCl/Al2O3 column indicated the formation of 142 ± 14 μmol of 2,2-dimethylpropane (0.9 ± 0.1 tBuCH3/W). Pentane (10 mL) was introduced into the reactor by distillation, and the solid was washed three times. After evaporation of the solvent, the resulting brown powder was dried under vacuum (1.34 Pa) to yield 498 mg of solid 2 (see Tables 1 and 2).
Preparation of Solid 3 by Solventless Impregnation. The same procedure as the one described above was used: 1 (76.4 mg, 0.16 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and SiO2-(200) (362 mg), giving 410 mg of solid 3 and 142 ± 14 μmol of 2,2-dimethylpropane, that is, 1.8 ± 0.2 tBuCH3/W (see Tables 1 and 2).
Preparation of Solid 2*by Solventless Impregnation. The preparation of 1* was performed according to the same procedure as that used for 1, but starting with a 70:30 (or 90:10) mixture of nonlabeled tBuCH2Cl and (99% atom 13C) monolabeled tBuCH2Cl to form tBuCH2MgCl (30% or 10%) labeled as alkylating agents (yield 80−85%, see refs 8, 9 for experimental details).
The 13C-enriched surface compound 2* was prepared using the same procedure as described above by using 1* in place of 1. (See Table 2 for data.)
Preparation of Solid 3* by Solventless Impregnation. The 13C-enriched surface compound 3* was prepared using the same procedure as described above by using 1* in place of 1.
Treatment under H2 of the Solids (quantification of neopentyl-like ligands). The solid was heated at 150 °C in the presence of a large excess of anhydrous H2 (77 330 Pa). After 15 h, the gaseous product was quantified by GC (see Table 1).
Metathesis of Propene. The solid 2 (0.0625 mol % W) was contacted with propene (0.600 Bar, 1600 equiv) purified over R3-11 BASF catalyst/MS4A in a reactor at 25 °C. Small aliquots were analyzed by GC over time.
Metathesis of Methyl Oleate. A solution of known concentration of methyl oleate (0.123 M, 100 equiv) in toluene containing octadecane as an internal standard (16 mg, 6.0 μmol) was freshly prepared, degassed with three freeze−pump−thaw cycles, and dried over freshly 3 Å activated molecular sieves. The solid 2 (1.0 mol % W) was placed in a 5 mL batch reactor equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, and the reactor was closed with a cap equipped with a Teflon septum. At t = 0, the solution was added at 25 °C under vigorous stirring via a syringe through the septum, and small aliquots were sampled, diluted in pure solvent (0.5 mL), and analyzed by GC.

18This is different from what has been observed previously in ref 16. Nonetheless, in this reference, Buffon et al. prepared SiO2-(200) in a different way: after a calcination at 450 °C, silica was treated under vacuum at 200 °C. We have found that when calcination is performed at a temperature T higher than that of dehydroxylation, the resulting silica corresponds to a silica dehydroxylated at the temperature T. Therefore the silica used by Buffon et al. corresponds to a silica treated at 450 and not 200 °C; at this temperature, silica contains mainly isolated silanols and generates mainly monosiloxy species (see ref 5).
