(1) with a silica dehydroxylated at 500 "C produces a mixture of (=SiO)Ta(=CHC- 
(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3)2 (2a) and (Wi0)2Ta(=CHC(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH3)3) 
(2b) and neopentane gas (on average 1.3 
equiv/equiv of tantalum). The reaction of 2d2b with water produces 2.6 mol of neopentane. The reaction of 2d2b 
with acetone produces 1 
equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene 
per grafted tantalum, indicating that 2a,b each bear one 
carbene ligand. When 1 is reacted with fully (>90%) deuterated silica, the product neopentane is only 38% 
monodeuterated. The product of this reaction (2deut) is hydrolyzed with D20 to produce 2.6 equiv (per Ta) of 
neopentane as a mixture of neopentane-4, -dl, -d2, and -d3 (3.3:54.4:36.7:5.5). The presence of neopentane-d3 is 
evidence for the incorporation of deuterium into the tantalum surface complex during the synthesis of 2d2b. The 
volatile product of the reaction of 
with acetone is 1 equiv of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene which is 15% 
monodeuterated, demonstrating some incorporation of deuterium in the carbenic positions of &ut. 
The isotopomeric 
distribution in the volatile products of these reactions is traced to a mechanism of formation of 2a,b in which the 
first reaction of surface silanol with 1 is the addition of 0-H across the Ta=C double bond. 
Introduction 
Alkylidene complexes are generally considered to be the 
reactive intermediates in the metathesis of olefins and in the 
polymerization of alkynes.' The presence of alkylidene species 
in heterogeneous catalysts for these reactions has often been 
suggested but rarely confiied. Such species have been 
indicated by infrared spectroscopy2 
and by chemical reactivity3 
but the actual surface organometallic species have never been 
fully characterized. 
We report herein that the reaction of Ta(=CHC(CH&)- 
(CHzC(CH3)3)3 (1) with partially dehydroxylated silica produces 
a mixture of surface tantalum(V) alkylidene complexes formu- 
lated (~SiO)xTa(=CHC(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH~)3)3-x 
(x = 
1,2) (2). 
The reaction of 1 with deuterated silica surface SiO-D silanols 
leads to partially deuterated 2. Detailed analyses of the 
isotopomeric distribution of reaction products are compared 
favorably to a mechanistic model which supposes 
that alkylidene 
complexes are formed by a mechanism of initial addition of 
surface silanol across the tantalum-carbon double bond of 1, 
producing a tetraalkyl tantalum siloxide intermediate which then 
can undergo an elimination of neopentane via a-hydride transfer 
to form a carbene complex.

Results and Discussion 
Reaction Followed in Situ by Infrared Spectroscopy. 
When the tantalum(V) alkylidene complex Ta[=CHC(CH,)3]- 
[CHzC(CH&]3 (1)4 
was sublimed onto a disk of silica which 
has been dehydroxylated at 500 "C (Si02(500), 20 mg), the 
infrared spectrum (Figure 1) showed that the band attributed to 
linear silanol groups5 at 3747 cm-' (Figure la) disappeared 
totally and instantaneously on contact at room temperature with 
the tantalum alkylidene complex. At the same time, a group 
of bands appeared in the regions 3000-2800 and 1500-1300 
cm-', which are attributed to v(C-H) and 6(C-H) vibrations 
of neopentyl andor neopentylidene groups. Excess 1 was 
removed under vacuum at 80 "C (Figure lb). The gaseous 
product of this reaction was identified as neopentane by gas 
chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. The simul- 
taneous decrease in the intensity of surface silanol bands and 
increase in the intensity of v(C-H) and 6(C-H) bands, together 
with the release of neopentane, suggest the formation of one or 
several chemisorbed organotantalum surface species, 2. 
Characterization of 2: Elemental Analysis. Elemental 
analysis for tantalum of the silica disk described above was 
performed and confirmed the presence of tantalum in 2 (5.15% 
Ta). The reaction was reproduced on a larger scale (500 mg). 
This allowed for transfer of the tantalum-bearing material under 
inert atmosphere and thus simultaneous tantalum and carbon 
analyses. The TdSiO2 material was found to contain 3.04%

Ta and 2.18% C. The carbodtantalum ratio (11.6 CRa) 
indicates that there are, on average, 2.3 C5 ligands per tantalum 
center. 
Characterization of 2: Confirmation and Quantification 
of the Neopentane Product. The reaction between 1 and 
surface silanols was repeated using deuterated silicq5~) 
(> 
90% 
Si-OD by IR) on a larger scale (500 mg, 3.37% Ta, 3.0 pmol 
of Ta). The neopentane given off during the adsorptionl 
desorption process was trapped and quantified (4.1 pmol of 
C5H12, 1.35 moVmol of Ta).6 Mass spectroscopy indicated a 
mixture of nondeuterated, monodeuterated, and bisdeuterated 
neopentane (60.7, 37.8, and 1.5%, 
respectively). The presence 
of some deuterated neopentane demonstrates that at least some 
of the neopentane given off is the result of reaction between 
tantalum and the surface silanols. At first glance, one might 
think that the nondeuterated neopentane was an indication of 
decomposition of the starting material or other intramolecular 
reactions and dismiss the 1.5% neopentane-d2 as aberrant, but 
we shall demonstrate that these values are the result of silanol 
addition over the Ta-C double bond prior to the a-elimination 
of neopentane (vida infra). 
Characterization of 2: Assay of Neopentyl Ligands in 2 
and Carbon Balance. The reaction of 2 with D20 was followed 
in situ by infrared spectroscopy. The silica disk, initially (as 
2) yellow, was exposed to heavy water vapor (15 Torr) and 
tumed white instantly on contact. The infrared spectrum at this 
stage showed a strong decrease in the intensity of the bands in 
the region 3000-2500 and 1500-1350 cm-', which are 
attributed to Y(C-H) and d(C-H) vibrations of neopentyl and 
or neopentylidene groups. At the same time, there appeared a 
relatively sharp band at 2783 cm-' assigned to v(Ta0-D) 
together with the bands associated with isolated and hydrogen- 
bound silanol v(Si0-D) bands (2760 cm-' (sharp) and 2730 
cm-' (broad)). Although the color change of yellow to white 
was instantaneous, it was necessary to leave the reaction for 16 
h at room temperature to achieve complete disappearence of 
v(C-H) and d(C-H) bands. 
(6) Based on the elemental analysis of the catalyst obtained after the 
experiment. 
The conditions of complete reaction thus established, the 
deuterolysis was repeated on a larger scale (200 mg) and with 
2 produced by the reaction between 1 
and deuterated silicacsm, 
('90% 
D) (%deut). The gaseous product of the reaction was 
neopentane (2.6 moVmol of Ta), and thus, taking into account 
the 1.35 moVmol of Ta released during the formation of 2deut 
(vida supra), all four (3.95 equiv neopentane) Cs ligands of the 
starting complex 1 
are accounted for. The neopentane produced 
during deuterolysis was a mixture of neopentane-do (3.3%), -dl 
(54.4%), -d2 (36.9%), and -d3 (5.5%). The appearence of 
neopentane-d2 and -d3 confirmed the presence of an alkylidene 
ligand, and furthermore, 
the presence of neopentane-d3 indicated 
that the complex %deut was partially deuterated at the carbenic 
position. 
Characterization of 2: CP-MAS 13C NMR. The yellow 
material, 2, was transferred under argon into a zirconia drum 
for CP-MAS 13C 
NMR analysis. Broad peaks were observed 
in the NMR spectrum at 33 and 45 ppm. 
The solution 13C 
NMR spectrum of the starting carbene 1 
in 
benzene had four peaks. A peak at 35 ppm was assigned4 
to 
the methyl groups of neopentyl and neopentylidene groups and 
the quaternary carbons of the neopentyl groups of 1. A small 
peak at 47 ppm was assigned to the quaternary carbon of the 
neopentylidene 
group. The methylene groups of the neopentyl 
ligands produced a signal at 117 ppm, and the carbenic carbon 
of the neopentylidene group appeared at 249 ppm. 
The peak observed in the solid state 13C NMR of 2 at 33 
ppm is quite similar to that observed by Schrock for 1 (35 ppm, 
all CH3 
and CHzC(CH3)s). More significantly, the presence of 
a neopentylidene ligand is implied by the peak observed in the 
solid state 13C NMR of 2 at 45 ppm, that which would 
correspond to the quatemary carbon of the neopentylidene ligand 
(47 ppm in 1). Neither the methylene carbons nor the carbenic 
carbon was observed, but it is common in solid state NMR that 
nuclei close to the surface (in this case, directly attached to a 
grafted metal atom) are not observed. This observation can be 
attributed to the lack of thermal motion (and thus spin-rotation 
relaxation) near the surface. Another possible cause of the 
absence of these peaks could be broadening due to coupling of

the a-carbons with the tantalum. Nevertheless, we can note 
that the 13C 
CP-MAS NMR spectrum obtained for 2 is consistent 
with a surface species similar to 1

Characterization 
of 2: Determination of Surface Carbene. 
Schrock reported that the pseudo-Wittig reaction between 
acetone and 1 
in pentane solution (25 "C, instantaneous) leads 
to the formation of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene 
(80% yield) and 
[O=TaNp3],.7 Schrock repeated the reaction using the mono- 
deuterated T

(deuterated > 
90% 
D at the carbenic position). The olefin product was >90% 
monodeuterated, indicating that in the pseudo-Wittig reaction 
the acetone reacts exclusively with the carbene ligand. 
Assuming that the pseudo-Wittig reaction would be as 
selective for the surface carbene, as it was for the molecular 
carbene we expected that the reaction of 2 with acetone vapor 
would produce 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene. Indeed, the reaction 
of 2 (3.72% Ta, 15.2 pmol of Ta) with an excess of acetone 
produced 1 equiv of the olefin (15.6 
pmol). This indicates that 
2 has, on average, one neopentylidene ligand per tantalum. The 
reaction of 2kUt 
with acetone produced 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene 
(31.9 pmol of Ta produced 34.1 
pmol of olefin). Again, 1 
mol 
of olefidmol of tantalum grafted was produced and was found 
to be 15% monodeuterated, confirmation 
that the neopentylidene 
ligand of 2 was partially deuterated. 
Characterization of 2: Summary. Thus we have estab- 
lished by elemental analysis and infrared spectroscopy a reaction 
between surface silanols and 1 
producing a surface tantalum 
complex bearing hydrocarbyl ligands. From the elemental 
analysis we established a first estimate of 2.3 C5 ligands per 
tantalum center. The formation of 2 was accompanied by the 
release of neopentane gas (1.35 equiv). The deuterolysis of 2 
produced 2.6 equiv of neopentane, accounting for all four C5 
ligands of 1. These two results suggest that 2 bears 2.6 CS 
ligands. The reaction of 2 with acetone produced 1 equiv of 
the Wittig-type product 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene, 
indicating the 
presence of one carbene ligand per tantalum. On the basis of 
these results, we suggest that the reaction of surface silanols 
with 1 
leads to silica-supported tantalum complexes connected 
by one or two siloxy bridges to the surface,

Our observation of neopentane-do and -d2 during the reaction 
of 1 
with WiOD and of neopentane-d3 from the deuterolysis 
of 2deut 
can be explained by a grafting mechanism in which the 
reaction of 1 with surface silanols takes place by first step

addition of the silanol 0-H(D) bond across t',e tantalum-n- 
pentylidene (Ta=C) double bond and not by the direct protolytic 
cleavage by the silanol of a tantalum-neopentyl (Ta-C) single 
bond. Precedent for this hypothesis is found in the reported 
addition of HCl over the (Ta=C) double bond of 1 
leading to 
the product Np4TaC1.4 
By applying this mechanism to the reaction of 1 
with surface 
silanols, one can neatly explain the aforementioned mass 
spectroscopic results. The addition of the first silanol SiO-H 
over the tantalum carbon double bond leads to an intermediate 
having four equivalent neopentyl ligands and one siloxy ligand, 
the silica bulk (=SiO)Ta(CHzC(CH3)3)4, type A (Scheme 1). 
Elimination of a neopentyl ligand with a-proton abstraction

(2a). In the reaction of 1 with a deuterated silanol =SiO=D, 
the deuterium in the intermediate (A) occupies one of the eight 
equivalent methylene positions, (%3iO)Ta(CHDC(CH3)3)(CHzC- 
(CH3)3)3. In the product, these eight protons translate into either 
one of the three methyl protons of the neopentane, CHK(CH3)3, 
or the alkylidene proton, (~~O)T~(=CHC(CH~)~)(CHZC(CH~)~)Z, 
or one of the four methylene protons of the two neopentyl 
ligands, (ES~O)T~(=CHC(CH~)~)(CH~C(CH~)~)Z. 
Thus in the 
reaction of 1 
with deuterated silica, the primary product 2a is 
actually a mixture of three isotopomers (Scheme 1, right): 
nondeuterated (37.5%), deuterated at a methylene position 
(50%), 
and deuterated at the alkylidene (12.5%). The neopen- 
tane released in the formation of 2a is 37.5% monodeuterated. 
Previous studies5 
have demonstrated the presence of geminal 
and vicinal silanols on the silicq5~) 
surface. The quantitative 
analyses of neopentane released during the reaction of 1 and 
silicqsm) (i.e., 1.35 mol of neopentanema) lead us to consider 
the possibility of the addition of a nearby second %io-D 
to 
the Ta=C double bond to produce an intermediate in which 
tantalum is bound to the silica surface by two siloxy groups, 
(+iO)zTa(CHzC(CH3)3)3, type B, which can undergo elimina- 
tion to produce the surface carbene, (%SiO)zTa(=CHC(CH3)3)- 
(CHzC(CH3)3) (2b), 
and a second equivalent of neopentane. By 
starting from the three isotopomers 2a, the mechanistic scheme 
was expanded to include this possibility. Scheme 2 shows this 
expansion for one of the three isotopomers of 2a. The relative 
ratios for the five possible tantulum products and the three 
isotopomers of the neopentane product of this second step are 
given in Table 1. Note that since 62.5% of 2a was monodeu- 
terated (Scheme I), bisdeuterated neopentane was can also be 
expected as a product of the second additiodelimination cycle 
(12.5% of neopentane given off in second cycle). 
Mechanism of Formation of 2: Comprehensive Model. 
The extents of deuteration of silica and heavy water (90% D) 
are included to produce a general model for the isotopomeric 
distribution of products of the reaction of 1 with deuterated 
silicqsm). Neopentane products formed with 2 are calculated 
directly as a function of the 2d2b ratio. The isotopomeric 
composition of the surface complexes (2a,b) 
are used to predict 
the distribution of deuterium in the products of the deuterolysis 
reaction and the Wittig reaction. The possibility of primary 
kinetic isotope effects is neglected. Such effects would be 
expected to be miniscule on the basis of the mechanism 
proposed. Table 2 is a summary of the isotopic distributions 
of the products of the various reactions studied as a function of 
the ratio of 2a to 2b. 
The experimental results are listed on one line in boldface in 
Table 2. This line is placed in the position coherent with the 
quantitative results, that is the number of moles of neopentane

per grafted tantalum given off during the reaction of 1 
with 
silica and during the deuterolysis of 2. For example, the 
deuterolysis of 2 produced 1.35 mol of neopentane/mol of Ta 
grafted. A priori this value indicates that the surface species 
was a mixture of 65% 2a (producing 0.65 equiv of C5H12j and 
35% 2b (producing 0.7 equiv of C5H12, thus a total of 1.35 
equivj. In our broader experience with this reaction (i.e., more 
than 20 experiments but under less rigorously controlled 
conditions), we have found that the ratio between neopentane 
released and tantalum adsorbed varies from 1

2
 
to 1.6:l with 
an average value at 1.3:l. The position of the experimental 
results in Table 2 represents the best estimate of 2d2b based 
on quantitative results. 
Mechanism of Formation of 2: Comparison of Experi- 
ment and Model. The goodness of the fit of this model 
confirms that the reaction between 1 and silica proceeds by a 
first step addition of silica surface 0-H across the tantalum- 
carbon double bond and subsequent elimination of neopentane 
and not by the direct reaction of the neopentyl ligand of 1 with 
surface O-H.9

quantity of neopentane given off in that particular experiment) 
we would expect 90% neopentane-dl from a direct reaction and 
39% neopentane-dl from the additiodelimination process. 
Experimentally, we found 37.8% 
neopentane-dl. Additionally, 
(9) A third mechanistic model was considered. In this model, addition 
of SiO-D across the Ta=C bond produces a type A intermediate which, 
rather than undergoing transfer elimination of neopentane to form 2a, 
undergoes protolytic cleavage 
of a tantalum neopentyl Ta-C 
bond to form 
directly a type B intermediate. The experimental resuhs cannot be 
consistently fitted to such a model. 
we detected neopentane-d2 (1.5% of all neopentane), which is 
unaccounted for by the direct reaction mechanism and predicted 
to be 3% of total neopentane by the additiodelimination 
mechanism. 
For the deuterolysis of 2 (60% 2a and 40% 2b), the direct 
reaction mechanism predicts that the distribution of neopentane- 
&:-dl:-d2:-d3 would be 7:62:31:0

Experimental Section 
General Procedure. All manipulations and reactions were con- 
ducted in the absence of solvent under strict inert atmosphere or vacuum 
conditions. Sealed tube reactors were used throughout. The extremely 
a
i
r
 and water sensitive surface-supported tantalum complexes were 
stored in sealed Pyrex break-seal tubes apt for the construction of 
secondary reactors (for the chemical assays of the surface complex). 2 
showed no evidence of decomposition when stored for a period of 2 
weeks at -40 "C in such tubes. Infrared spectra were recorded on a 
Nicolet 10MX-FT spectrometer equipped with a cell designed for in 
situ preparations under controlled atmosphere.1° Gas phase analysis 
was performed on a Intersmat IGC 121 FL equipped with a flame 
ionization detector and a Al20fiC1 on a fused silica column (50 
m x 
0.32 
mm). Elemental analyses were performed by the Central Analysis 
Service of the CNRS at Solaize and (for inert atmosphere determination 
of carbon and tantalum in 2) Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher, 
Remagen, Germany. Mass spectra were recorded on a quadrupole 
analyzer (Supravac VG) connected to a vacuum system able to maintain 
a residual pressure of 
Torr.

surface hydroxyl concentration of 2 
OWnmZ as determined by the 
titration with LiAl&." 
Deuterated silica was prepared by heating

"C for 3-4 
h followed by evacuation at that temperature for 3-4 h. This procedure 
was repeated three times before a final dehydroxylation at 500 
"C for 
15 h. The acetone (Prolabo, Normapur) was distilled over CaC12, 
degassed, and stored over molecular sieves (4 
A). D20 (Aldrich) was 
degassed and stored under vacuum. 1 was prepared by the method of

Preparation of (ES~O),T~(=CHC(CH~)~)(CHZC(CHJ)~)~-, 
(x = 
1, 2), (2). Ta(=CHC(CH3)3)(CH2C(CH&)3 was sublimed under 
vacuum 
" H g )  at 80 "C onto the silicqsW). The silica takes on 
a yellowish color. Unreacted starting material was removed by 
sublimation under vacuum for 2 
h at the same temperature. Gases 
were trapped in a liquid nitrogen cooled tube and sealed for later 
analysis. Air was admitted to this trap to atmospheric pressure just 
before GCIMS analysis. 
MAS NMR spectroscopy. MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a 
BRUKER MSL-300 spectrometer operating at 75.47 
MHz for 13C. 
The 
probehead was a commercial double-tuned 7 
mm double-bearing 
system 
from BRUKER allowing spinning frequencies up to 4 
kHz. The 
samples were introduced in the rotor made of zirconia under a dry 
nitrogen atmosphere in a glovebox and tightly closed. Boil-off nitrogen 
was used for both bearing and driving the rotors. For 13C NMR, a 
typical cross-polarization sequence was used: 90" 
rotation of the 'H 
magnetization (impulsion length 6.2 
ps), then contact between carbon 
and proton during T
,
 = 5 
ms, and finally recording of the spectrum 
under high-power decoupling. The delay between each scan was fixed 
to 5 
s, to allow for the complete relaxation of the 'H nuclei. Chemical 
shifts are given with respect to TMS by using adamantane as an extemal 
reference (6 = 37.7 
ppm for the highest chemical shift). 
Reaction of 2 (or 2deut) with D20. The D20 was vacuum distilled 
into a reactor containing 2. The solid tumed from yellow to white 
immediately on contact with the water vapor. Infrared spectra indicate 
that the reaction was complete within 15 
h at room temperature. Gases 
released were transferred in vacuo into a trap cooled by liquid nitrogen 
and sealed. Air was admitted to this trap to atmospheric pressure just 
before GCMS analysis.

was filled with acetone vapor (excess with respect to tantalum) 
at room temperature. The solid tums from yellow to beige instanta- 
neously. Nevertheless 2 was left in contact with acetone for 2 
h to 
insure complete reaction. 2,4,4-Trimethyl-2-pentene 
was transferred 
in vacuo into a trap equipped with a septum and cooled by liquid

not as decisive for this experiment 
as it was for the sublimation, 
the presence of neopentane-d3 cannot be accounted for by the 
direct reaction model. 
The reaction of 2 
with acetone is expected to produce exactly 
1 equiv of 2,2,4-trimethyl-2-pentene 
regardless of the ratio 2a/ 
2b. 
The additiodelimination model predicted that the reaction 
of 2 
with acetone would produce significant (1 
1-24%) amounts 
of 
deuterated olefin product, regardless of the 2d2b 
ratio. The 
direct reaction mechanism for the formation of 2 
does not predict 
deuterium incorporation into the olefin. Experimentally we 
found that the olefin was 15% deuterated, which is consistent 
with a mixture of 70% 2a 
and 30% 2b. 
Conclusions 
The reaction of 1 with a partially dehydroxylated silica leads 
to formation of a mixture of surface alkylidene complexes,
