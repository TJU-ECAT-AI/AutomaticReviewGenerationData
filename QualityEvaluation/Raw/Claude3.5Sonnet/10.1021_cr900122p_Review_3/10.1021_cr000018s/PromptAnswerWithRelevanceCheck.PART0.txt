Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, or catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document does not discuss H/D exchange, alkane metathesis, or related mechanisms involving these specific catalysts. There is no mention of reaction rates, selectivity, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes for these particular systems. The literature focuses on other topics related to catalysis and carbon management, but does not cover the specific hydride catalysts and C-H activation reactions mentioned in the question.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中不包含任何关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息,也没有涉及它们的制备、结构或在C-H键活化反应中的催化性能。文档没有讨论这些特定催化剂的H/D交换、烷烃复分解或相关机理。对于这些特定体系,文献中没有提到反应速率、选择性、σ-键复分解、氢解或链行走过程。该文献主要集中在与催化和碳管理相关的其他主题上,但没有涉及问题中提到的特定氢化物催化剂和C-H活化反应。
