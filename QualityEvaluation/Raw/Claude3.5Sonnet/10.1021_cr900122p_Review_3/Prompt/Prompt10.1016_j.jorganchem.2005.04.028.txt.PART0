Abstract
The reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 (1) and SiO2-(700) generates (SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) (2) when performed in
C6H6 (material 1=SiO2-700C6H6). The grafting occurs presumably by protonation of the nitrido ligand to form an intermediate
(SiO)Mo(@NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3), a pentacoordinated complex, which decomposes into 2 and 2,2-dimethylpropane. While
1=SiO2-700C6H6 is highly active in olefin metathesis, 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 and [1/SiO2-(700)]THF are poorly active or inactive catalysts
respectively. In contrast, when Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 reacts with a molecular silanol derivative, a soluble model of the surface of
SiO2-(700), it yields a very stable complex, (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(@NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), which does not spontaneously generate
2,2-dimethylpropane and an alkylidene complex in contrast to the surface complex. Moreover, 3m does not catalyse olefin meta-
thesis at room temperature as it does not already contain the initiating carbene ligand, and it is necessary to heat up the reaction
mixture to 110 C to obtain low catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the complex 3m generates well-defined metallocarbenes when heated
in the presence of PMe3: (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2 (4m) as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti rotamers with
the loss of 2 equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpropane.

1. Introduction
Surface organometallic chemistry is aimed at generat-
ing well-defined active site precursors through the con-
trolled reaction of an organometallic complex with an
oxide support [1]. Since Herisson and Chauvin [2] pro-
posed that metallocarbenes were key intermediates in
olefin metathesis, there has been a tremendous effort at
preparing well-defined metallocarbenes as homogeneous
catalyst precursors [314]. Of the different metals, Mo,
W and Ru have emerged as the key elements to achieve
highly active and selective catalysts. They can be classi-
fied in two different families. Mo- and W-based systems
are typically d0 metal complexes having a set of ligands
which increases the electrophilicity of the metal centre,
and Ru-based systems are d4 metal complexes with basic

ligands, which help the dissociation of one ligand to gen-
erate the active species (Scheme 1). In contrast, hetero-
geneous catalysts, which were historically the first
olefin metathesis catalysts and which are still used in
large scale industrial processes today [15], are usually
metal oxides supported on an oxide support, typically
silica, magnesia or alumina, for which the formation
of the active sites is still unclear despite recent advances
[1619]. Within this area, we have been interested at pre-
paring well-defined heterogeneous olefin metathesis
catalysts by generating well-defined metallocarbenes
supported on silica. Using this strategy, we have
prepared and characterized [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CH-
t-Bu)(CH2tBu)], probably the most active Re heteroge-
neous catalyst and of activity comparable to that of
the best homogeneous Re-based catalysts [20]. In homo-
geneous catalysis, group 6 metals are usually more sta-
ble and more active. One of the best set of ligands has
been discovered by Schrock et al. [3,4,2125], and the
corresponding complexes are imido alkoxy systems,
[(RO)2Mo(@NR)(@CHtBu)]. The closest well-defined
surface organometallic complex is [(SiO)Mo(@NH)-
(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], which was prepared by reaction
of [Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3] (1) [26] and a silica partially
dehydroxylated at 500 C. However, it has only been
prepared by sublimation in small quantities due to the
thermal instability of 1 [27]. Its promising activities in
olefin metathesis lead us to develop a preparation proce-
dure for larger quantities, to investigate the synthesis of
the corresponding molecular complex [{(RO)3SiO}-
Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], and to compare the
corresponding surface vs. molecular complexes.
2. Experimental
2.1. General procedure
All experiments were carried out under dry and oxy-
gen free Ar using either standard Schlenk or glovebox
techniques for the organometallic synthesis. For the syn-
theses and the treatments of the surface species, reac-
tions
were
carried
out
using
high
vacuum
lines
(1.34 Pa) and glovebox techniques. Silica (Aerosil De-
gussa, 200 m2 g1) was compacted with distilled water,
calcined at 500 C under air for 2 h and treated under
vacuum (1.34 Pa) at 500 C for 12 h and then at
700 C for 4 h. In experiments requiring deuterated sil-
ica, a similar procedure was used, but after treatment
under vacuum at 500 C for 12 h, silica was contacted
with D2O (ca. 0.5 mL), heated at 80 C for 30 min, trea-
ted under vacuum at 500 C for 5 h (35 cycles) followed
by a treatment under vacuum at 700 C for 4 h (support
referred to as deuterated SiO2-(700), 7982% deuterated
according to IR spectroscopy). Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 (1)
was prepared according to the literature procedure
[26]. (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH (Aldrich, 99%) was dried un-
der vacuum (1.34 Pa) at 60 C for 12 h prior to use. Pro-
pene (N, Air Liquide) and H2 (N, Air Liquide) were
purified by passing them through R-3-11 BASF catalysts
and 4 A
 molecular sieves. Ethyl oleate (Aldrich, 99%)
was purified according to the literature procedure [28].
1-Octene (Aldrich, 99%) was distilled over Na under
Ar prior to use. C6H6 was distilled from sodium benzo-
phenone ketyl prior to use and stored over 3 A
 molecu-
lar sieves. Hexane was distilled from NaK under N2.
Toluene was distilled from NaK under N2 and stored
over 3 A
 molecular sieves. CH2Cl2 was distilled from
P2O5 under N2 and stored over 3 A
 molecular sieves.
THF was distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl un-
der N2 prior to use. C6D6 was distilled from sodium benzo-
phenone ketyl prior to use. Toluene-d8 was dried over
3 A
 molecular sieves prior to use. Octadecane (Aldrich,
99%) was used as received. Gas phase analysis was per-
formed on a HewlettPackard 5890 series II gas chro-
matography (GC) apparatus equipped with a flame
ionisation detector (FID) and a KCl/Al2O2 column
(50 m · 0.32 mm). Liquid phase analysis was performed
on a HewlettPackard 6890 series II GC apparatus
equipped with a FID detector and an HP1 column
(30 m · 0.32 mm). Products were identified by GC/MS
(HP G1800A) equipped with a KCl/Al2O2 or an HP1
column. Elemental analyses were performed at the Uni-
versity of Bourgogne, Dijon (H, C and N) and at the
SCA in Solaize (Mo).
Liquid state NMR spectra were recorded in C6D6 or
toluene-d8 as a solvent in a Young type NMR tube. 1H,
13C{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a
Bruker AC 300 spectrometer at 300.18, 75.47 and
121.49 MHz, respectively, using the solvent as an inter-
nal standard for 1H and 13C. For 31P NMR, a solution
of H3PO4 85% in H2O was used as an external standard.
13C, 15N and 29Si{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a
DRX-500 spectrometer at 115.78, 50.69 and 99.36 MHz,
respectively.
1H15N 2D HMBC experiment was re-
corded with the standard Bruker inv4gplrnd sequence
and processed in absolute mode (D6 = 100 ms, Gradi-
ent = 703050). External NH3 was used as a reference
for 15N NMR. 1H13C 2D HSQC experiment was re-
corded without 1H decoupling with the standard Bruker
invietgs sequence and processed in phase mode (Gradi-
ent = 202010). 1H MAS (number of scans = 8, 90

state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
500 spectrometer with a conventional double resonance
4 mm CP-MAS probe. The rotation frequency was set to
10 kHz. The samples were introduced in a zirconia rotor
in the glove box and tightly close with a kel-f cap. Chem-
ical shifts are reported in ppm downfield from SiMe4,
and coupling constants are reported in Hz. ESR spectra
were recorded on Varian E9 spectrometer at 77 K
against DPPH (Ho = 329.5 mT, g = 2.0036). The sam-
ples were introduced in a quartz tube in the glove box
and sealed under vacuum. Titration of Mo(V) d1 was per-
formed by using VO(SO4)2 as a standard for d1 system,
(35.5 mg, V (wt%) = 3.52, 24.4 lmol, H = 334.2 mT,
g = 1.975). Mass spectra (ESI+) were recorded on a
ThermoFinningan LCQ Advantage instrument.

tem (NONIUS, MACH3 j-CCD) at the window of a
rotating anode (NONIUS, FR591) and graphite mono-
chromated Mo Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A
 ). The unit
cell parameters were obtained by full-matrix least-
squares refinement of 12399 reflections [29]. Data collec-
tion were performed at 123 K within a H-range of
1.2 < H < 25.2. Nine data sets were measured in rota-
tion scan modus with D//Dx = 1.0. A total of 82454
intensities were integrated. Raw data were corrected
for Lorentz, polarization, and, arising from the scaling
procedure, for latent decay and absorption effects [30].
After merging (Rint = 0.064), 12400 [10805: Io>2r(Io)]

refine 681 parameters. The refinements converged with
R1 = 0.0388 [Io > 2r(Io)], wR2 = 0.0930, and GOF =

2.4.2. Thermal stability of 3m in the absence of 1-octene
at 60 C
In a NMR tube, a light yellow solution of 3m (21 mg,
0.017 mmol) in C6D6 (0.5 mL) was heated at 60 C for 4
days, and no evolution in the spectrum of 3m was ob-
served during that time as monitored by
1H NMR
spectroscopy.
2.4.3. Thermal stability of 3m in the absence of 1-octene
at 110 C
In a NMR tube, a light yellow solution of 3m (25 mg,
0.020 mmol) in toluene-d8 (0.4 mL) was heated at
110 C, and the reaction was monitored by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. 2,2-Dimethylpropane was slowly formed
over time, and after 4 days, it was the major product
along with numerous unidentified Mo species.
2.4.4. Thermal stability of 3m in the presence of 1-octene
To a NMR tube containing a light yellow solution of
3m (32 mg, 0.026 mmol) in toluene-d8 (0.4 mL) was
added 1-octene (50 lL, 0.318 mmol, 12 equiv.). The
reaction mixture was heated at various temperatures
for 2 h. No reaction was observed at 25, 60 and 80 C
according to 1H NMR spectroscopy. Heating the sam-
ple to 110 C for 4 h shows the disappearance of 1-oc-
tene and the formation of ethylene and 7-tetradecene
according to 1H and 13C{1H} NMR and GC analysis.

SiOMo(@NH)(CH2tBu)3 (20 mg, 17 lmol) in C6D6
(0.5 mL). Monitoring the reaction by 1H NMR showed
that no reaction takes place at 25 C. Heating the sam-
ple for 24 h at 70 C shows the quantitative formation
of (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(PMe3)2 as
a mixture of 2 rotamers along with 30 lmol of 2,2-di-

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Grafting monitored by infrared spectroscopy
A disk of SiO2-(700) (55 mg) was immersed into a solu-
tion of [Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3] (1), (6 equiv.) in C6H6 for
4 h. After washing three times with C6H6 and a drying
step under vacuum, an IR spectrum was recorded and
showed the following features (Fig. 1). The band as-
signed
to
the
isolated
silanol
groups
m(OH)
at
3747 cm1 disappears, but a broad band centred at
3722 cm1 appears in agreement with the presence of
residual silanols, which are in interaction with surround-
ing ligands (70% of silanols have reacted as measured by
IR spectroscopy). Moreover, a sharp band with a broad
base appears at 3396 cm1 assigned to m(@NH); the cor-
responding d(@NH) is found at 1473 cm1. Finally, two
groups of bands appear in the 30002700 and 1500
1300 cm1 regions, respectively, assigned to m(CH) and
d(CH). The same features are observed when impregna-
tion is carried out in CH2Cl2 (see Figure S1 in supple-
mentary materials). Some silanols do not react and are
in interaction with the ligands bound to Mo (the broad
signal centred at 3722 cm1). This is in contrast to what
has been observed during the grafting of Mo(C-
tBu)(CH2tBu)3 [36] and most of the corresponding per-
hydrocarbyl transition metal complexes on SiO2-(700)
[37,38]. This data is however consistent with the low
Mo loading (vide infra). The major difference is the pres-
ence of NH bands, and it is possible that the residual
OHs are in fact hydrogen bonded to nearby N centres,
which would also explain the slight broadening of the
base of this NAH signal. Additionally, when a deuter-
ated SiO2-(700) is used (m(SiOD) = 2762 cm1, 79% deu-
terated according to IR, see Figure S2 in supplementary
materials), the band at 3396 cm1 appears shifted at
2526 cm1 as expected. The appearance of m(CH),
d(CH), m(@NH) and d(@NH) as well as the disappear-
ance of the isolated m(OH) and the formation of 2,2-
dimethylpropane is consistent with a chemical grafting
of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 on silica.
3.2. Influence of the solvent in the grafting of 1
on SiO2-(700)
In order to obtain larger quantities of the material,
grafting
was
performed
by
contacting
at
25 C
Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 (1 equiv./SiOH) and 0.51.0 g of
silica (SiO2-(700)) in the presence of a solvent. Three dif-
ferent solvents, C6H6, CH2Cl2 and THF, are used, and
the resulting supported materials [1/SiO2-(700)]solvent are
characterised by mass balance analysis of the grafting
step, elemental analysis and 1H MAS solid state NMR
spectroscopy. While Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 is soluble in
CH2Cl2 or THF, it is only sparingly so in C6H6. There-
fore, in the latter case, only a small quantity of C6H6
was
used
to
disperse
the
two
solids,
Mo(N)-
(CH2tBu)3 and SiO2-(700), and several washing were used
to remove the excess of 1. The Mo loading varies be-
tween 0.4 and 1.6 wt%, which corresponds to 0.04
0.17 mmol of Mo/g of silica, while the concentration
of silanols is about 0.26 mmol OH/g on SiO2-(700) [39
41]. This shows that 2070% of the silanols has been
consumed during grafting, which is consistent with what
has been observed by IR spectroscopy, i.e., the presence
of residual silanols (vide supra). Moreover, during this
process, 0.7 and 1.0  0.1 mol of 2,2-dimethylpropane
(tBuCH3) per grafted Mo is formed when grafting is per-
formed in CH2Cl2 and C6H6, respectively, while none is
observed in THF (Table 1). Moreover, when grafting is
performed in CH2Cl2, the resulting solid contains about
12.5  1.1 carbons/Mo, which correspond to more than
2 neopentyl-like ligands/Mo (neopentyl or neopentylid-
ene), and whose quantity has been confirmed by the
treatment under H2 (carbon analysis by hydrogenolysis).
However, elemental analysis also reveals the presence of
0.51 wt% of Cl, that is 1 Cl/Mo, which corresponds to
0.5 equiv. of remaining CH2Cl2 per total grafted Mo.
F. Blanc et al. / Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 690 (2005) 50145026
5019
Additionally, when pure CH2Cl2 is contacted with silica
and then evaporated under the same conditions used
for impregnation, no CH2Cl2 is observed by 1H solid
state
NMR,
thus
showing
that
in
the
case
of
1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2, CH2Cl2 is probably coordinated to
Mo. During grafting in C6H6 (Table 1, entry 34), the
resulting solid contains 9.6  0.5 and 8.8  0.5 car-
bons/Mo as measured by elemental analysis and hydrog-
enolysis,
respectively
(10 C/Mo
expected
for
the
structure 2). Additionally, when SiO2-D-(700) (82% D
according to IR) was used, 2,2-dimethylpropane evolved
mainly as a non-labeled isotopomer (93%) along with
small amounts of the monodeuterated one (7%). These
data are consistent with a grafting occuring mainly via
protonation of the nitrido ligand to yield an intermedi-
ate
species
3,
(SiO)Mo(@NH)(CH2tBu)3,
which
evolves
towards
(SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2-
tBu) (2) via a selective a-H abstraction by a neopentyl
ligand of an H borne by an adjacent neopentyl ligand
as proposed previously when this compound was pre-
pared by sublimation on small quantities (Scheme 2)
[27]. The
1H MAS solid state NMR spectrum of
1=SiO2-700C6H6 shows only two peaks at 1.1 and
2.1 ppm corresponding to the CH2 (2H) and tBu
(18H) signals, respectively (Figure S3, see supplemen-
tary materials). No other peak corresponding to the
NH and the alkylidene ligands, expected in the 37
[42] and 415 ppm [8] regions, respectively, is detected
even though the NH fragment has been clearly identified
by IR spectroscopy, suggesting that these signals are
probably broad and not observable by solid state
NMR. For [1/SiO2-(700)]THF and 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2, ex-
tra signals appear, and they correspond to remaining
coordinating
solvent
molecules
(see
supplementary
materials). In the case of 1=SiO2-700C6H6 ESR spectros-
copy showed only traces of Mo(V) species (<3%), which
is consistent with the presence of mainly Mo(VI) species
as in the starting material. Therefore, when C6H6 is used
as a solvent, around one 2,2-dimethylpropane evolved
during grafting, and the resulting solid contains about
1.82.0 neopentyl-like ligands per grafted Mo (910 C/
Mo), which is consistent with the formation of 2,
[(SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)], as proposed
already when this compound was prepared by sublima-
tion [27].
3.3. Reactivity towards olefins of materials
[1/SiO2-(700)]solvent
The activity in olefin metathesis of the different mate-
rials highly depends on the method of preparation.
While the material prepared in C6H6, 1=SiO2-700C6H6,
is
highly
active
in
the
metathesis
of
propene
(TOF(5 min) = 0.89 s1 with equilibrium reached within
25 min),
1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2
is
much
less
active
(TOF(5 min) = 0.001 s1), and [1/SiO2-(700)]THF is com-
pletely inactive (Table 2). These observations are fully
consistent with the decrease of activity of d0 catalysts

in the presence of coordinating solvents, but it is
worth mentioning that in the original paper [27], all
the reactions were carried out in CH2Cl2, which
probably slowed down the reaction rate dramatically.
Furthermore, when 1=SiO2-700CH2Cl2 was contacted
with propene a second time after evacuation of the
gas phase (1 h, 30 C, 1.34 Pa), the initial rate slightly
increases (0.13 s1), which is consistent with a displace-
ment of CH2Cl2 as the first loading of propene was
evacuated.
The initial rate of 1=SiO2-700C6H6 is comparable to
those reported for (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 and
(SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)
(Table
3)
[36,38,43]. Moreover, the rate is much greater than those
observed for Mo-based heterogeneous catalysts, MoO3/
S (S = SiO2, Al2O3), which typically work under much
higher temperature conditions, ca. 150250 C. It is
however still lower than those reported for comparable
molybdenum homogeneous catalysts [44,45].
Moreover, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (tBuCH@CH3) and
trans
4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene
(tBuCH@CHMe)
are
formed in a 2.5:1 ratio, albeit only in small amounts,
i.e., 0.15 equiv./Mo. 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butene is the major
cross-metathesis product, as observed for homogeneous
catalysts and (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)
[38,43], because the favoured pathway involves the
metallacyclobutane intermediate for which [1,2]-interac-
tions are avoided and [1,3]-interactions are minimised
(Scheme 3) [46].
When 1=SiO2-700C6H6
is contacted with 13000
equiv. of propene using the standard procedure, only
7% conversion are reached, thus showing that deactiva-
tion occured. However, it is possible to reach the ther-
modynamic
equilibrium
(34%
conversion)
when
propene is purified over both R3-11 BASF catalyst/Zeo-
lithe and MnO/SiO2. The catalyst 1=SiO2-700C6H6
yields up to 35000 productive TON in less than
35 min when 185000 equiv. of propene is used. Under

these optimised conditions (using highly purified pro-
pene), (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 and (SiO)
Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu) reach 38000 and 2000
in 1 h 30 and 1 h, respectively.
The material 1=SiO2-700C6H6
also catalyses the
metathesis of liquid olefins such as 1-octene, for which
1300 equiv. are equilibrated in only 1 h, which is similar
to what is usually observed for homogenous Mo-based
catalysts [44,45], and much lower than those observed
with the best Ru-catalysts [28]. Moreover, 100 equiv.
of ethyl oleate are equilibrated in only 20 min by
1=SiO2-700C6H6 with an initial rate of 0.11 mol/mol/s.
For comparison, 3 h 30 are necessary to obtain an equil-
ibrated
mixture
for
(SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CH-
tBu)(CH2tBu) under the same experimental conditions,
while (SiO)Mo(CtBu)(CH2tBu)2 deactivates be-
fore reaching 25 TON. Finally, 700 productive TONs
are reached in 24 h when 2000 equiv. of ethyl oleate
are used, which is a little lower than what was found
for (SiO)Re(CtBu)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu). Those re-
sults are quite remarkable since classical heterogeneous
catalysts are often incompatible with functional groups
such as esters [20,47,48].
3.4. Development of an equivalent homogeneous olefin
metathesis catalysts
In order to further characterize this system, we have
also investigated the reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3
with a soluble model of SiO2-(700) [1,4952]. A previous
study has used triphenylsilanol [27], but polyhedral olig-
omeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) are considered better
models since they display pKa values closer to that of sil-
ica [53]. Of the various POSSs, (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH is
considered as a good model for SiO2-(700) [37,38,54].
Therefore, under similar reaction conditions as those
used for the preparation of 1=SiO2-700C6H6, a suspen-
sion of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH
stirred in C6H6 yields a yellow solution of (c-C5H9)7-
Si7O12SiOMo(@NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), pure (>98%) by
NMR of the crude material (Scheme 4). The 1H NMR
spectrum of 3m in C6D6 exhibits all the 1H resonance
of the cyclopentyl substituents of the POSS derivative
as well as resonances at 3.36, 2.39 and 1.14 ppm in a
1:6:27 ratio, corresponding, respectively, to the NH,
the methylene and the tBu protons. The
13C{1H}
NMR spectrum shows signals at 22.8, 23.2, 27.4, 27.5,
27.9, 28.1 assigned to the carbon associated with the
cyclopentyl ligands of the POSS derivative and some
others at 32.7, 34.9, 84.2 characteristics of neopentyl
groups. Moreover, the 1H15N 2D HMBC NMR spec-
trum shows one correlation between the signals at
3.36 ppm (F1, 1H) and 338.8 ppm (F2, 15N), confirming
its assignments to the NH fragment (Fig. 2). The trace
at 338.8 ppm in the F2 dimension shows a doublet with
a 1J1H15N = 65.4 Hz. The chemical shift and the JHN
coupling constant are consistent with its assignment to
an imido group, Mo@NH [42,55,56]. IR spectroscopy
in nujol shows a peak at 3375 cm1 also in agreement
with
the
presence
of
the
Mo@NH
group.
The
29Si{1H}NMR spectrum of this compound contains 4
signals in a 3:1:3:1 ratio: three at 65.63, 65.68,
65.72 ppm in 3:1:3 ratio, characteristic of three differ-
ent T3 Si, assigned to the three different types of alkyl
substituted Si atoms, and one at 105.11 ppm charac-
teristic of a Q4, that is a silicon bound to 4 O atoms
[57]. Suitable single crystals were grown from a satu-
rated solution of 3m in hexane cooled at 30 C, and
the structure was confirmed by X-ray analysis (Fig. 3).
The complex 3m has a bipyramidal trigonal geometry
with the three alkyl substituents in the basal positions;
the N and the O atoms occupying the two apical posi-
tions. The MoC and MoO bond distances are
2.1192.124 and 1.984 A
 , respectively, as expected
[26,27] and the MoN bond distance (1.727 A
 ) is fully
consistent with an imido group [26,27,58]. The salient
features are also the very wide Mo@NH (177) and
MoOSi (172.2) angles, the former clearly showing
that the N acts as a LX type ligand to stabilize the other-
wise highly unsaturated Mo centre.
In contrast to the surface complex 2 and other related
systems (vide infra), the molecular species does not
spontaneously release one equiv. of 2,2-dimethylpro-
pane at room temperature to generate the alkylidene
complex
3m.

no intermediate was observed [38,54]. Even in the
case
of
Ta(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3,
its
reaction
with
(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH
generates
an
intermediate
(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOTa(CH2tBu)4, which readily decom-
poses at room temperature into (c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiO-
Ta(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)3
and
tBuCH3
[37].
The
complex 3m is stable up to 60 C in C6D6 solution for
weeks, and it slowly decomposes at 110 C over several
hours. Furthermore, when 3m is heated at a temperature
as high as 80 C in the presence of 1-octene, the NMR
spectrum is unaltered, and no olefin metathesis takes
place. It is necessary to carry out this reaction at
110 C to observe a quantitative transformation of 1-oc-
tene (12 equiv.) into ethylene and 7-tetradecene along
with the decomposition of 3m into a complex reaction
mixture. Note that this is in sharp contrast to the surface
complex 2, which can transform 1300 equiv. of 1-octene
in 1 h at room temperature (vide supra).
Additionally, heating the complex 3m at 70 C in
the presence of 10 equiv. of PMe3 generates 2 equiv.
of 2,2-dimethylpropane and a new red complex (c-
C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2
(4m)
as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti rotamers (Scheme
5). In the 1H NMR, the signal at 2.39 ppm associated
with the CH2 of the tBuCH2 ligands in 3m disappear,
while two triplets appear in a 10:1 ratio at 13.67
(JP-H = 6.5 Hz) and 14.23 (JP-H = 5.5 Hz) ppm in agree-
ment with the formation of two metallocarbenes, each
of them coordinated with two equivalent P atoms per
Mo.
Moreover,
performing
an
HSQC
experiment
showed that the signals at 13.67 and 14.23 displayed,
respectively, a correlation with signals in the 13C dimen-
sion
at
313.0
(1JCH = 110 Hz)
and
321.0
(1JCH =
136 Hz) ppm as resolved doublets. These data are fully
consistent with the presence of two alkylidene rotamers,
syn and anti-(4m).(8) Additionally, the 29Si{1H}NMR
spectrum of 4m contains 3 signals in a 4:3:1 ratio: two
at 65.64, 66.21 ppm (T3), one at 100.79 ppm
(Q4), the Q4 being downfield with respect to this ob-
served for 3m. Its 31P{1H} NMR spectrum shows two
singlets at 8.0 and 9.3 ppm in a 10:1 ratio corre-
sponding to coordinated PMe3 of syn-(4m) and anti-
(4m), respectively. The formation of 4m from 3m is in
fact quite similar to what has been found for other bis-
alkyl complexes upon addition of PMe3, for which the
extrusion of one neopentyl ligand is observed upon
coordination of extra donor ligands [5962]. This prob-
ably shows that the surface might play the role of this

place of 3.
4. Conclusion
The reaction of Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 and SiO2-(700)
generates
(SiO)Mo(@NH)(@CHtBu)(CH2tBu)
(2)
when performed in C6H6 1=SiO2-700C6H6. The grafting
occurs presumably by protonation of the nitrido ligand
to
the
form
an
intermediate
(SiO)Mo(@NH)-
(CH2tBu)3 (3), a pentacoordinated complex, which
decomposes into 2 and 2,2-dimethylpropane. While
1=SiO2-700C6H6 is highly active in olefin metathesis,
the preparation of [1/SiO2-(700)] in THF or CH2Cl2 yields
inactive or poorly active catalysts. The preparation of
this material can be easily performed on 1 g scales, but
it can be readily scale-up to 10100 g scale, replacing
C6H6 by toluene since 1 and SiO2-(700) are readily
accessible.
In contrast, when Mo(N)(CH2tBu)3 reacts with a
molecular silanol derivative, which we and others have
typically used to model the surface of SiO2-(700), it yields
a
very
stable
complex,
(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(@
NH)(CH2tBu)3 (3m), which does not spontaneously gen-
erate 2,2-dimethylpropane and an alkylidene complex in
contrast to the surface complex. Moreover, 3m does not
catalyse olefin metathesis at room temperature as it does

not already contain the initiating carbene ligand, and it
is necessary to heat up the reaction mixture to 110 C to
obtain some catalytic activity, presumably because an
unstable carbene has been generated. In trying to trap
this reactive intermediate complex, 3m was heated in
the presence of trimethylphosphine, and it generated
(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOMo(N)(@CHtBu)(P(CH3)3)2 (4m)
as a 10:1 mixture of its syn and anti carbene rotamers
with the liberation of 2 tBuCH3/Mo. While a metallo-
carbene was generated, it also suffers from the loss of
the imido ligand.
Finally, while molecular silanols derivatives can help
to understand surface structures [4952], the aforemen-
tioned differences illustrate that it can be misleading to
determine surface structures solely through solution
chemistry. Moreover, it also shows that it is possible
to generate on surfaces highly unsaturated species,
which is probably the basis for the high reactivity of het-
erogeneous catalysts prepared via surface organometal-
lic chemistry.
