Daniel J. Mindiola*
Open PDF
Abstract
A library of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes containing terminal metalligand multiply bonded functionalities such as alkylidenes, alkylidynes, and imides have been prepared by one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction reactions. In the case of the alkylidene motif, the nucleophilic nature of the MC multiple bond permits subsequent reactions such as α-hydrogen migration to generate other rare functionalities such as phosphinidenealkyl and imidealkyls. Identifying and fine-tuning of the supporting ancillary ligand on the metal has allowed the isolation of kinetically stable titanium alkylidene and phosphinidene systems. The former is a key functionality to generate transient titanium alkylidynes, which readily engage in intermolecular CH activation reactions of arenes and alkanes, and the ring-opening metathesis of aromatic substrates such as pyridines. In this Account, we describe several synthetic strategies to achieve reactive functionalities, functionalities that were previously portrayed as incompatible or too kinetically reactive with 3d early transition metals.

1. Introduction
High-oxidation-state transition metal alkylidenes are an important functionality to industrial processes such as cross-metathesis, ring-closing metathesis, ring-opening metathesis, ring-opening metathesis polymerization, acyclic diene metathesis polymerization, acetylene polymerization, and Wittig-type or group-transfer reactions. The increasing importance of metal alkylidene complexes has been manifested in several reviews (1) and highlights, (2) with the most prominent result being the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry bestowed to Chauvin, Grubbs, and Schrock. (3) Likewise, the closely related functionality, the alkylidyne, is now beginning to be applied in catalytic processes such as alkyne metathesis and polymerization reactions. (4)
Parallel to the metalcarbon double bond functionality is the isolobal nitrene group (:NR). (5) As expected, the imide functionality also assumes its rightful place alongside the MC bond since such systems play pivotal roles in stoichiometric :NR group transfer, (5) catalytic processes such as the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes (5,510) and alkenes, (11) hydrohydrazination, (12) aziridination, (5a) multicomponent coupling reactions, (13) guanylations, (14) and recently carboamination, (15) among other important transformations. (5a) Unlike high-oxidation-state transition metal alkylidenes, the imide functionality is versatile, and on occasion it can behave as an ancillary ligand purely invoked in stabilizing reactive metal fragments during the catalytic cycle. (5a,5h) Such a contrast between :CR2 and :NR motifs can be partially blamed on the highly nucleophilic or Schrock-like nature of the alkylidene ligand when bound to a very electropositive metal. Hence, alkylidene complexes are often represented as +MCR2-  MCR2, much like ylides resonate, while imides can be depicted as -MN+R instead of MNR.
In contrast to alkylidenes or imides, high-oxidation-state transition metal phosphinidenes continue to be a scant functionality. (16) These systems have drawn popularity in the past decade given their ability to perform important transformations such as phospha-Staudinger or -Wittig-type reactions for the construction of low-coordinate phosphaorganic molecules. (17) Specifically, d0 phosphinidene complexes are the carbon copy17b of the Schrock-type alkylidenes since phosphorus is slightly more electropositive than carbon.
As a result, MC, MN, and MP multiply bonded linkages are all important and related functionalities given their involvement in catalysis and group-transfer processes. Therefore, organometallic chemists are continuously discovering new synthetic routes to these motifs, especially in low-coordination environments since unsaturated organotransition metal complexes are inherently reactive and provide useful templates to study small molecule activation5c and catalysis. (5a,5g) In this Account, we will describe a series of synthetic methods to achieve these types of functionalities with the transition metals titanium and vanadium. Some subsequent reactivity involving these ligands will also be presented and discussed.
2. Accessing Low-Coordinate Early Transition Metal Complexes (Metal = Ti or V) Having Terminal Alkylidene Functionalities
Despite rapid growth of research in the area of high-valent metal alkylidenes, (1) far less attention has been applied to the synthesis and reactivity of terminal alkylidene complexes of 3d early transition metals. The rather low number of terminal alkylidene complexes of titanium is somewhat surprising since titanium alkylidenes generated in situ are utilized commonly as stoichiometric reagents in organic synthesis. (18) So why are first row early transition metal alkylidenes so scarce? First, it is necessary to know how high-oxidation-state transition metal alkylidenes are commonly prepared, and second, it is important to consider the trends in the periodic table between first row transition metals and second and third row congeners.
The most common method to prepare high-oxidation-state metal alkylidenes is by promoting α-abstraction or α-deprotonation reactions from metal alkyl complexes lacking β-hydogens (eqs 13). (1)
In order to promote the α-hydrogen abstraction to yield high-oxidation-state metal alkylidenes, one must typically stimulate photochemically (eq 1), sterically (eq 2), or with a base (eq 3) the high-valent metal center. (1,19,20) An elegant but rare approach to the terminal alkylidene functionality involves a two-electron reduction step, which promotes an α-hydrogen migration (eq 4). (21)
Last, olefin rearrangement to the d0 alkylidene has also been documented (eq 5). (22)
Since first row early transition metals are far more readily reduced than the second and third row congeners, reduction reactions are far more common, hence limiting the alkylation step in the high-valent state. Unavoidably, this property makes dehydrohalogenation or α-hydrogen abstraction reactions much more common for the heavy congeners.
2a. Oxidatively Induced α-Hydrogen Abstraction Reactions. The entry into d0-metal alkylidenes is often restricted to α-H abstraction reactions where a good leaving group is generated (e.g., an alkane or a very weak conjugate acid). In addition, access to low-coordinate systems possessing this functionality can be difficult or limited, since formation of the metalalkylidene bonds typically stems from a high-oxidation-state and coordinatively saturated complex (eqs 14). For this reason, an attractive entry to the assembly of low-coordinate systems possessing metalligand multiple bonds can be derived from a redox reaction where the low-valent metal is alkylated, then oxidized. (23) Oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction reactions to generate reactive MC bonds can be traced back to the work by Cooper and co-workers (referred to as an H atom transfer). (24) However, it was not until 1995 that McCamley and co-workers trapped a transient niobium alkylidene by a redox route. (25) Their studies described the one-electron oxidation of Nb(IV)(η5-C5H4tBu)2(CH2Ph)2 with AgBPh4 to generate a Ag0 mirror along with the kinetically unstable benzylidene [Nb(V)(η5-C5H4tBu)2(CHPh)][BPh4] salt. (25) The latter intermediate underwent facile CH activation reactions in toluene to afford the cyclometallated product (Scheme 1a). The mechanism of the C-H activation reaction was not discussed in their work. A similar process involving one-electron oxidation to generate MC linkages was reported by Otero and co-workers. (26) In their work, one-electron oxidation of the Nb(IV) alkyne Cp2Nb(η2-MeOC(O)CCMe) (Cp = C5H4SiMe3) with [FeCp2][BPh4] generated a binuclear vinylidene complex (Scheme 1b). (26) Unfortunately, the mechanism of this reaction remains to be clarified. Work by Cooper, McCamley, and Otero suggested, tantalizingly, that high-valent metalcarbon multiple bonds could be assembled under a one-electron oxidation pathway, provided a good leaving group was generated in the process. Could similar reactions be applied to the lighter congeners of group 4 and 5 transition metals? Of particular interest was the seminal work reported by Budzelaar (27) and Theopold (28) on redox active and stable early transition metal dx (x = 13) complexes having metal alkyl ligands. These complexes contain first row transition metals prone to one-electron oxidation, where the leaving group would be an entropically and thermodynamically favorable product like an alkane.

2b. Synthesis of Low-Coordinate Titanium Alkylidenes. The protocol to prepare low-coordinate and terminal titanium alkylidene complexes involved a modification of the synthesis of (nacnac)TiCl2 (nacnac- = [Ar]NC(Me)CHC(Me)N[Ar], Ar = 2,6-(CHMe2)2C6H3), reported previously by Budzelaar and co-workers. (27) We chose the sterically encumbering nacnac- ligands given their precedent to generate low-coordination environments. (29) Following Budzelaar's procedure, we recrystallized the THF base adduct (nacnac)TiCl2(THF) (1) from toluene in 70% yield as dark green blocks. Ether solutions of 1 react smoothly with 2 equiv of LiCH2tBu to afford emerald green solutions of (nacnac)Ti(CH2tBu)2 (2), which resulted in formation of dark blocks in excellent yield. (30) When complex 2 was treated with AgOTf or 1/2 equiv of I2, a rapid color change from green to red brown was observed concurrent with formation of the alkylidene complexes (nacnac)TiCHtBu(X) (X- = OTf, 3-OTf, 89%; X- = I, 3-I, 61%) as evaluated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic methods (Scheme 2). (30,31) Compounds 3-OTf and 3-I display Cs symmetry in solution and have a Cα resonance centered at δ  271272 ppm with a JCH coupling constant of 9085 Hz. The latter parameters are consistent with these systems having a terminal alkylidene functionality where there is significant α-hydrogen agostic interaction with the low-coordinate metal center. The low-coordination number in 3-OTf and 3-I was also confirmed by single-crystal crystallographic studies. (30,31) We speculate that complexes 3-OTf and 3-I are formed from the putative five-coordinate and d0 intermediate (nacnac)Ti(CH2tBu)2(X), (32) which then undergoes smooth α-hydrogen abstraction to form the TiC linkage. The labile pseudohalide group in 3-OTf can be exchanged readily for Cl-, Br-, BH4-, and -CH2SiMe3 to afford other alkylidene analogues thereby creating a new class of titanium alkylidene complexes (Scheme 2). (31) In addition to transmetallation reactions, complex 3-OTf can also engage in Wittig-like, acidbase, and intramolecular CH activation rearrangements (Scheme 3 displays a pinwheel of reactivity for 3-OTf). (30,31,33) To block these decomposition pathways from occurring, we prepared Ti(III) precursors supported by more robust ancillary ligands such as nacnactBu- ([Ar]NC(tBu)CHC(tBu)N[Ar], Ar = 2,6-(CHMe2)2C6H3) and PNP- (N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2). (34) As a result, kinetically stable titanium alkylidene complexes such as (nacnactBu)TiCHtBu(X) (X- = OTf, 4-OTf; X- = I, 4-I), and (PNP)TiCHtBu(OTf) (5) can also be prepared via the one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction protocol but using instead the precursors (nacnactBu)TiCl2 (6) and (PNP)TiCl2 (7) (Schemes 4 and 5, respectively). It is important to note that attempts to integrate the neopentylidene functionality directly onto Ti(IV) led to a myriad of products. Hence, in order to avoid reduction pathways in the alkylation process, one must first alkylate a lower-valent TiIII precursor and then oxidize by one-electron to promote the α-hydrogen abstraction. We have determined that both bulky alkyl groups and large coordinating anions are needed in order to promote steric crowding and subsequent α-hydrogen abstraction. (32)

2c. Synthesis of Low-Coordinate Vanadium Alkylidenes. Our recent strategy to prepare the first four-coordinate titanium neopentylidene via an oxidatively induced α-abstraction reaction30 motivated us to pursue other 3d transition metals that lacked such a motif. (35,36) Unlike titanium, vanadium displays more diverse redox chemistry; hence oxidation states ranging from +2 to +5 are commonly allowed. Using Budzelaar's precursor (nacnac)VCl227 and 2 equiv of LiCH2tBu, we prepared the bis-neopentyl complex (nacnac)V(CH2tBu)2 (8) in 80% yield as dark brown needles (Scheme 6). (36) One-electron oxidation of 8 with AgBPh4 generated a Ag0 mirror concurrent with the vanadium(IV) alkylidene complex [(nacnac)VCHtBu(THF)][BPh4] (9) in 74% yield (Scheme 6). By anion exchange with MgI2, the neutral vanadium(IV) alkylidene (nacnac)VCHtBu(I) (10) can be readily prepared. (36) Cationic and neutral complexes such as 9 and 10 are paramagnetic and therefore display EPR spectra consistent with a doublet ground state and reveal coupling to the vanadium center (I = 7/2, 99.6%). (36) Molecular structures for each system reveal α-H agostic interactions taking place with the d1-metal center. More importantly, the d1 nature of these systems prevents α-H migration from occurring. Compounds 9 and 10 are also reactive, inasmuch as thermolysis of each lead to THF dehydrogenation or Wittig-like rearrangement, respectively. (36)

3. Synthesis of MN Multiply Bonded Systems
3a. Oxidatively Induced α-Hydrogen Abstraction Reactions to Prepare Low-Coordinate Titanium Imides. The synthesis of 3 stimulated the pursuit of an analogous titanium imide complex. Intuitively, NH abstraction should be more facile than CH, especially since metalimide formation is thermodynamically more favorable than MC given the ability of imides to form a pseudo MNR linkage with an early transition metal. The dichloride precursor (nacnac)TiCl2(THF)30 reacts readily with 2 equiv of LiNHAr to afford the bis-anilido titanium(III) complex (nacnac)Ti(NHAr)2 (11) in 92% yield (Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3, Scheme 7). (39) Chemical oxidation of 11 with AgOTf caused a color change from green to orange-red concomitant with formation of a Ag0 mirror. Immediate workup of the reaction afforded the bis-anilido triflato salt [(nacnac)Ti(NHAr)2][OTf] (12) in 71% yield (Scheme 7). (37) Complex 12 is remarkably stable as a solid, but solutions of 12 slowly transform to the four-coordinate titanium imide (nacnac)TiNAr(OTf) (13) and H2NAr, and the former can be isolated as red prisms in 67% yield (Scheme 7). (37) Unlike complex 2, which displays an irreversible oxidative wave at 0.90 V (referenced vs FeCp2/FeCp2+ in THF/TBAH, TBAH = [Bu4N][PF6]) for the Ti(III)/Ti(IV) couple, complex 11 revealed a reversible oxidation wave at 0.89 V for the Ti(III)/Ti(IV) couple, thus suggesting that one-electron oxidation is not the rate-determining step for this type of transformation.
Scheme 7
3b. Oxidatively Induced Trimethysilyl Abstraction Reactions. If TiN preparation concurrent with NH bond formation (H2NAr being a leaving group) are the favored products resulting from the one-electron oxidation, then perhaps other products, in addition to aniline, could be envisioned as great leaving groups. When a THF solution of the Ti(III) hexamethyldisilazide complexes (nacnac)TiCl(N(SiMe3)2) (14) or (PNP)TiCl(N(SiMe3)2) (15), both prepared from 1 equiv of NaN(SiMe3)2 and the corresponding dichloride precursor (Scheme 8), is treated with [FeCp2][OTf], oxidation rapidly occurs to generate the silylimides (nacnac)TiNSiMe3(OTf) (16) and (PNP)TiNSiMe3(OTf) (17), along with ClSiMe3 and FeCp2 (Scheme 8). (38) Separation of the silylimide is readily achieved by fractional crystallization. Alternatively, the Ti(III) precursors 14 and 15 can be treated with 2 equiv of AgOTf to yield complexes 16 or 17 in isolated yields greater than 76% (Scheme 8). (38) We believe Ag+ not only acts as an oxidant but partakes in the salt metathesis of Cl- for OTf-.

4. Synthesis of MC Multiply Bonded Systems
4a. Preparing Low-Coordinate Vanadium Alkylidynes by Two One-Electron α-Hydrogen Abstraction Reactions. Terminal alkylidyne ligands in groups 4 and 5 transition metals are far more limited when compared to the alkylidene functionality. (1) Lippard and Protasiewicz reported the Fischer-carbyne complex (CO)(dmpe)2VCOSiPh3 (VC, 1.754(8) Å), (39) but it was not until recently that d0, 3d transition metals alkylidynes of group 5 could be prepared. (40) Given our ability to generate four-coordinate vanadium(IV) alkylidenes, it was thought that alkylation of such species followed by one electron oxidation, should in principle promote another α-hydrogen abstraction to furnish the VC linkage in a high-valent state. In view of that hypothesis, the four-coordinate neopentylidene complex 10 can be readily alkylated with LiCH2SiMe3 to afford the neopentylidenealkyl species (nacnac)VCHtBu(CH2SiMe3) (18) in good yield (Scheme 9). (40) Complex 18 exhibits a solution magnetic moment of 1.90 μB, and the EPR spectrum is in accordance with a V(IV) radical center. As hypothesized, one-electron oxidation of 18 with AgOTf or AgBPh4 yielded the neutral (nacnac)VCtBu(OTf) (19) or cationic [(nacnac)VCtBu(THF)][BPh4] (20) four-coordinate alkylidyne complexes in 59% and 65% yield, respectively (Scheme 9). (40) Interestingly, our strategy to prepare first row d0 metal alkylidynes from vanadium alkylidenes contrasts Schrock's two-electron reduction reactions of high-valent alkylidenes to prepare TaC linkages. The latter process has been referred to as an α-H elimination, a 1,2-H migration, or an α-dehydrogenation. (20)
Scheme 9
4b. Preparing Low-Coordinate Titanium Alkylidynes by α-Hydrogen Abstraction Reactions. The broad range of oxidation states for vanadium allows us to carry out two one-electron oxidation/one α-hydrogen abstraction processes in the sequence V(III)  V(IV) + e- + H+  V(V) + e- + H+ (alternatively referred to as proton-coupled electron transfer, PCET) (41) to generate the VC linkage. However, this could not be the case for titanium, since the Ti(III)  Ti(IV) + e- + H+ process is only plausible. Despite this redox limitation, our one-electron oxidatively induced α-hydrogen abstraction allows for not only MC bond formation but also incorporation of a labile group for subsequent transmetallation with a sterically imposing base to promote another α-hydrogen abstraction. Unfortunately, attempts to trap titanium alkylidynes via α-hydrogen abstraction from precursors such as (nacnac)TiCHtBu(OTf) or (nacnactBu)TiCHtBu(OTf) and a bulky base have proven unsuccessful given the propensity of the β-diketiminate ligand to undergo multiple transformations. (31,33) Frustrated by these observations, we decided to examine other titanium alkylidene systems that were more kinetically stable. For this reason, we focused our attention to the PNP pincer-type framework, N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2-, developed by Ozerov and Liang. (42) In 2004, Ozerov and co-workers reported the zirconium alkylidene alkyl complexes (PNP)ZrCHR(CH2R) (R = Ph or p-tolyl). These systems were readily prepared from the thermolysis of the corresponding trisalkyl systems (PNP)Zr(CH2R)3. (42a) As a result, we pursued similar systems with Ti, since steric hindrance at the smaller Ti4+ ion should favor another α-hydrogen abstraction to furnish the desired TiC linkage. The d1 precursor to the alkylidene 7, (PNP)Ti(CH2tBu)2 (21) (vide supra), can be conveniently prepared from a one-pot synthesis of Li(PNP) and TiCl3(THF)3, followed by the addition of 2 equiv of LiCH2tBu. (34) In order to promote α-abstraction and form 7, complex 21 is oxidized with AgOTf to generate a Ag0 mirror and alkylidene 7 quantitatively (vide supra, Scheme 5). (34) Likewise, the trimethylsilyl alkylidene derivative (PNP)TiCHSiMe3(OTf) (22) can be alternatively prepared from (PNP)Ti(CH2SiMe3)2 (23) and AgOTf. (43)
Alkylation of 7 with LiCH2tBu in pentane allows for clean isolation of the titanium neopentylideneneopentyl complex (PNP)TiCHtBu(CH2tBu) (24) (Scheme 10). Complex 24 is a highly reactive complex inasmuch as it transforms in benzene at 27 C over 11.9 h (4.5 half-lives) to (PNP)TiCHtBu(C6H5) (25) quantitatively. (43) Combining high-level density functional theory (DFT), labeling, and kinetic studies, we demonstrate that complex 23 first undergoes α-H abstraction concomitant with elimination of CH3tBu to afford the titanium alkylidyne intermediate (PNP)TiCtBu (A), which embarks on an intermolecular 1,2-addition of the benzene CH bond across the reactive TiC linkage to provide 25. The energy profile for the CH activation reaction is depicted in Scheme 11. (43) Interestingly, the CH and CD activation steps of benzene are reversible, since 25-d6 undergoes clean conversion to 25 in C6H6 (80 C, 48 h) and vice-versa, thus linking intermediate A to 25 in the reaction profile (Scheme 11). (43) In fact, the proposed reaction energy profile in Scheme 9 suggests that the reverse step of the CH activation, that is, 25  A, is associated with a barrier of 32.8 kcal/mol, which could be quite possible to overcome under elevated temperature conditions (vide supra). The titanium alkylidyne synthon 24 can activate multiple CH bonds in SiMe4 to afford (PNP)TiCHSiMe3(CH2SiMe3) (26) quantitatively, a complex that can be independently prepared from 22 and LiCH2SiMe3 in pentane (Scheme 10). As observed with 24, benzene solutions of 26 gradually react with C6H6, albeit more slowly (40 C, 24 h), to afford the alkylidene phenyl derivative (PNP)TiCHSiMe3(C6H5) (27) (Scheme 10). Exchange with C6D6 is also observed with 27 to generate the isotopomer (PNP)TiCDSiMe3(C6D5), (27)-d6. Hence, the possibility of transient titanium alkylidynes (A or (PNP)TiCSiMe3 (B)) makes it reasonable to propose this set of reactions. (43) Complex 24 is a synthon to A, consequently activating the CH bonds of other inert substrates such as alkanes and fluoroarenes. (44) Most notably, intermediate A can ring-open pyridines (45) at room temperature to afford azametallabycyclic frameworks such as 28 (Scheme 12). (46)

5. Accessing Low-Coordinate Early Transition Metal Complexes (M = V or Ti) Having Terminal Phosphinidene Functionalities
The polarized nature of the MC bond renders titanium and vanadium alkylidene functionalities exceedingly nucleophilic, thus readily engaging in α-hydrogen migration or deprotonation reactions of primary phosphides and amides. Schrock and co-workers applied this strategy to prepare tungsten alkylideneimide or alkylideneoxo complexes via an α-hydrogen migration route. (47) For us, this same protocol allowed the incorporation of the unusual terminal phosphinidene functionality16,17 onto low-coordinate 3d metals composed of both titanium(IV) and vanadium(IV). When the titanium alkylidene 3 is treated with LiPHMes* (Mes* = 2,4,6-tBu3C6H2), the terminal phosphinidene complex (nacnac)TiPMes*(CH2tBu) (29) can be obtained in 78% (Scheme 13). (48) Formation of 29 is proposed to occur via transmetallation of LiPHMes* with 3 to furnish a putative neopentylidenephosphide (nacnac)TiCHtBu(PHMes*) intermediate, which rapidly undergoes α-H-migration to form the TiP linkage. The 31P NMR solution spectrum of complex 29 reveals two resonances at 242 and 216 ppm consistent with two phosphinidene species. (48) The observation of these two isomers could occur for steric reasons or by deviation of the TiPAr fragment up and down from the imaginary NCCCN ligand plane. A similar fluxional process has been observed in four-coordinate scandium species supported by the same ligand. (49) The molecular structure of 29 displayed a four-coordinate titaniumphosphinidene complex possessing a short TiP bond (2.1831(4) Å)48 and a linear TiPCipso angle (164.44(5)). This value is much shorter than Pauling's predicted bond length of 2.288 Å for a TiP double bond. (50) Complex 29 is thermally unstable but undergoes rapid low-temperature reactions with CNtBu or cummulenes such as N2CPh2 to generate η2-(N,C)-phosphaazallene and phosphonylimide complexes, respectively. (51) Unfortunately, the thermal instability of 29 has prevented us from further probing the reactive nature of the TiP linkage. If steric encumbrance at P is reduced to a c-C6H11 or Trip (Trip = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2), the hypothetical phosphinidene intermediate generated from an α-hydrogen migration step is far too kinetically unstable and readily undergoes a series of intramolecular transformations such as phospha-Staudinger and phosphaalkene insertion reactions to generate the phosphine-based complex ([Ar]NC(Me)CHC(Me)P[CH2tBu])TiNAr(OEt2) (R- = Cy or Trip). (48) The intermediates along the transformation pathway to the phosphine have been observed via low-temperature 31P and 31P{1H} NMR studies.
Scheme 13
As opposed to titanium phosphinidenes, α-hydrogen migration utilizing vanadium alkylidene precursors also leads to terminal phosphinidene assembly. Consequently, complex 10 reacts rapidly with LiPHR (R = Trip or Mes*) to produce the terminal vanadium phosphinidene alkyls (nacnac)VPR(CH2tBu) (Scheme 14; R = Trip, 30; R = Mes*, 31). Solution magnetic measurements of 30 and 31 are consistent with a d1 V(IV) radical species, and the room-temperature X-band EPR spectra (Scheme 14) display a 16-line pattern resulting from hyperfine coupling of the unpaired electron to vanadium (Aiso  70 G) and superhyperfine coupling to P (I = 1/2, 100%, Aiso  40 G). (52) Solid-state structural studies of these phosphinidene compounds depict short vanadiumphosphorus multiple bonds (30, 2.174(4) Å; 31, 2.1602(6) Å). Both structural features and high-level DFT studies suggest these radical species to be stabilized not only kinetically but via a pseudo-JahnTeller effect of second order. (52,53) α-Hydrogen migration appears to be a general process since systems such as 5 also undergo TiP bond formation when treated with LiPHTrip to afford (PNP)TiPTrip(CH2tBu) (32) (Scheme 15). (34) Primary amides such as LiNHAr can also be transmetallated with 5 to furnish the imidealkyl functionalities in the complex (PNP)TiNAr(CH2tBu) (33) via an α-hydrogen migration step (Scheme 15). (34)

6. Conclusions
Oxidizing the appropriate titanium(III) or vanadium(III) systems by one-electron promotes an α-abstraction (H or trimethysilyl) to afford TiC, TiN, and VC linkages. In the case of vanadium, two-electron oxidation steps ultimately lead to VC bond formation. One-electron oxidation not only promotes α-hydrogen abstraction but also allows incorporation of labile ligands. This characteristic unavoidably results in a cascade of other functionalities being derived from the nucleophilic MC bond (alkylidynes, phosphinidenes, and imides), which we are now beginning to probe. Despite extensive work in this area, synthetic chemists will inexorably seek pathways to achieve novel metalligand multiple-bonded species, given their involvement in catalysts, as biological mimics, or as ancillary ligands. Novel metalligand multiply bonded archetypes of unprecedented reactivity will continuously flourish as long as synthetic chemists seek tactical pathways to generate them.
