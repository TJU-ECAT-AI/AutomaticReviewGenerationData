The development of immobilized of homogeneous catalysts 
by grafting to reactive surface structures is still far behind scien- 
tific and industrial demands."' While the mechanistic features 
of olefin metathesis have been elucidated in much detail.12] 
only 
little is known on immobilized heterogeneous catalysts having 
well-defined surface 
We now report on the poten- 
tial of alkylnitrido complexes as suitable precursors for surface- 
grafted imidoalkylidene species. 
Tris(neopentyl)nitridomolybdenum(v) 
(1) represents a linear 
coordination polymer in the solid state but reacts like a tetraco- 
ordinated monomer in 
This complex exhibits cata- 
lytic activity in the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of 
cyclic olefins such as norbornene at 60 "C ([mon.]![Mo] = 200, 
5 h, 20%). 
The instability of the nitridoneopentylidene complex 
[N=Mo(CHtBu)(CH,tBu)] presumably formed in situ is demon- 
strated by the immediate degradation by elimination of the 
neopentylidene coupling product 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-hex-

Cross-over experiments revealed an intermolecular mech- 
anism for this decomposition reaction.[51 
This fact and the reac- 
tivity profile of 1 toward organosilanols yielding imidotris- 
(neopentyl)cmplexes 
of type 2a and 2b, [Eqs. (a) and (b)] 
prompted the attempt to immobilize 1 on inorganic oxides.

The oxyfunctionalization of 1 demonstrates that this mole- 
cule exhibits ideal prerequisites for surface grafting, both from 
the molecular structure (low-coordinate molybdenum) and the 
electronic structure (electron-deficient metal center). The for- 
mation of the siloxy-bridged, dinuclear imidomolybdenum 
complex 2b reflects the stability of the metal-alkyl bonds to- 
ward a possible protolytic scission. This complex exhibits two 
nearly linear HN=MoO arrangements [average N-Mo-0 angle 
178.3 
(I)"] and trigonal-bipyramidal core geometries around the 
two metal centers (Fig.

When a sample of 1 
is sublimed at 70 "C onto a silica disc in 
a vacuum,r81 
the intensity of the 3(SiOH) bands at 3745 cm-' 
decreases strongly, while simultaneously bands at 3370 cm- ' 
for G(NH), in the range 3000-2850 cm-' for G(CH), and in the 
range 1500-1300 cm- ' 
for 6 (CH) grow gradually within about 
15 
h. When deuterated silica was used (> 
90 
O h  SiOD according 
to IR), a band at 2465 cm-' appeared during treatment with 1 
in place of the former absorption at 3370cm-', proving the 
assignment of an imido moiety (=ND vs. =NH) formed by 
1,2-addition of surface silanols across the nitridomolybdenum 
fragment in 1. The evolution of neopentane during the surface 
reaction is indicative of a further reaction step. Labeling exper- 
iments with N-Mo (CD,tBu), ([DI-1) 
yielded [D,]neopentane 
but no [DJneopentane (GC/MS). This result gives strong evi- 
dence that the detachment of one hydrocarbon equivalent from 
the metal is a a-hydrogen abstraction step subsequent to the 
initial grafting process of Equation (c). The proposed molecular 
structure of the final grafting complex 4 
is in agreement with the 
elemental analyses, which yield a Mo/N/C ratio of 1/1/10.

The ,HNMR spectrum of 4 exhibits a single resonance at 
6 = 2.45 attributable to the CD, group in the remaining 
neopentyl ligand. Similar chemical shifts in the structurally re- 
Iated molybdenum alkylidene complex [ 
tBuNMo(CHtBu) 
(CH,tBu)(OSiPh,)] were reported by Osborn.['] The I3C 
NMR 
spectrum of 4 
exhibits one resonance at 6 = 32.9, readily 
assignable to the CH, carbon atoms of the tert-butyl groups. 
The alkylidene carbon atom was not detectable; similar prob- 
lems were reported by Weiss and Basset.13] The proposed 
neopentylidene structure of 4 is, however, in full accord with 
the observed reactivity. For example, treatment with dry 
acetone at ambient temperature for 30min gave the Wittig- 
type coupling product 2,4,4-trimethylpent-2-ene in quantitative 
yield. 
The catalytic activity of the immobilized species 4 in olefin 
metathesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization was 
compared with the homogeneous precursor compound 1. The 
surface grafting of 1 on the partially dehydroxylated silica sur- 
face results in a strong enhancement of the catalytic activity as 
shown in Table 1. 
For example, norbornene yields at ambient temperature the 
ROMP polymer at an olefin/molybdenum ratio of 300 with 
turnover frequencies beyond 3000 h- '. In contrast, the molecu- 
lar nitrido complex is completely inactive under these and relat- 
ed reaction conditions. The concept of organometallic surface 
catalysis experienced its breakthrough when metal alkyls based

on tantalum or zirconium were used as molecular precursors. In 
these cases, however, alkyl groups 
are detached during the graft- 
ing process as a consequence of protIysis.'] 
In our case, all 
alkyl groups first remain at the metal since the acidic surface 
silanols attack the nitridomolybdenum moiety, whereas only in 
the second step an I-elimination occurs, yielding the corre- 
sponding alkylidene species. Further work in this area is in 
progress.

Chiral Heterocylic Carbenes in Asymmetric 
Homogeneous Catalysis** 
Wolfgang A. Herrmann,* Lukas J. Goossen, 
Christian Kocher, and Georg R. J. Artus 
According to preliminary investigations, N-heterocyclic car- 
benes of the imidazole, pyrazole, and triazole type act as con- 
trolling ligands in organometallic homogeneous catalysis.['* 
*] 
The key advantage of these ligands appears to be that they do 
not dissociate from the metal centers, particularly in the case of 
electron-rich catalytically active metals like rhodium or palla- 
dium."] In contrast to the well-established phosphanes, an ex- 
cess of ligand is not needed-an 
important criterion for future 
industrial applications. In this publication it is shown that chiral 
N-heterocyclic carbenes can be prepared conveniently; more- 
over, they form organometallic complexes for asymmetric ho- 
mogeneous catalysis. 
For the chiral imidazolium salts la,b 
a ring closure synthesis 
starting from inexpensive materials was needed,[31 
which can be 
applied broadly and which proceeds without racemization. The 
C,-symmetric derivatives la,b with chiral centers directly con- 
nected to the ligand core were obtained i

If the ring closure is performed with racemic amines the meso- 
isomers of la,b and 2a,b are formed as well (NMR). This con- 
firms that the synthesis is free from racemization up to the step 
of the free carbenes 2a,b. A possible configurational lability of

excluded.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.
