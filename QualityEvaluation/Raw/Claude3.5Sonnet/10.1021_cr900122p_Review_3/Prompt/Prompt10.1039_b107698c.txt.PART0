DFT(B3PW91) calculations of the activation of CH4 by models (Cl2LnZ) of Cp*2LnZ (Z = H, Me) have been carried
out for the entire lanthanide series. Cl2LnZ appears to be a good model for Cp*2LnZ. It reproduces well the
coordination around the lanthanide. The energetics of the transformation X2LnH  CH4 
 X2LnCH3  H2 are
fairly close for X = Cl and Cp and the difference in behavior can be attributed to the stronger electron donating ability
of Cp. Formation of the lanthanide hydride complex is calculated to be exothermic in agreement with experimental
evidence. The energy profiles of the reactions Cl2LnH  CH4 
 Cl2LnCH3  H2; Cl2LnH*  CH4 
 Cl2LnH 
H*CH3; Cl2LnCH*3  CH4 
 Cl2LnCH3  HCH*3 have been calculated. The transition states for the first and
third transformations are energetically accessible, in good agreement with the known experimental data. The second
reaction has a transition state of very high energy indicating an unfeasible reaction. The geometry of the transition
stuctures are suggestive of a proton transfer between two anionic species (Z and CH3
; Z = H and CH3
) in the field
of the lanthanide fragment.
Introduction
The discovery that Cp*2LuCH3 (Cp* = C5Me5) activates CH4
(eqn. (1)) 1 has been a landmark in the search for new catalysts
able to activate inert bonds especially those in alkanes.213
Since no electrons are available on the lanthanide, the acti-
vation of the CH bond must necessarily occur without change
of oxidation state at the metal center. In a related reaction,
Cp*2LnH exchanges H in the presence of H2. An early MO
analysis suggested the exchange of hydrogen occurs via a σ-
bond metathesis between the LnH and HH bonds.14 DFT
calculations of this reaction have shown it to be energetically
very easy and to occur via a 4-center (4-c) transition state repre-
sentative of a bond metathesis process.15 The energy of
activation has been found to depend on the nature of the
lanthanide although it remains low for the entire Ln series. The
activation of CH4 should follow a similar pattern. However it is
known that CH is more difficult to activate than HH mainly
because of the spherical nature of the 1s H orbital and the
directional nature of the Me sp3 hydrid.1618 For similar reasons,
a σ-bond metathesis involving metalH and HH bonds is
expected to be kinetically more facile than that involving
MMe and CH bonds. Experimental results support this
trend: eqn. (1) requires heating at 70 C whereas eqn. (2) occurs
at room temperature. Remarkably Cp*2LuH does not react
with CH4 to exchange hydrogens (eqn. (3)) or to make Cp*2Lu

Me (reverse of eqn. (2)). Furthermore these three reactions
should have higher activation energies than the hydrogen
exchange in eqn. (4). An interesting side question is thus to
determine if the lanthanides associated with the highest
activation energy in the case of eqn. (4) could make eqn. (1)
energetically unfeasible. This would be informative of the
ability of different lanthanides to activate CH4.
Theoretical calculations have been used to understand the
activation of inert bonds with considerable success.19,20 In most
studies, CH activation has been initiated by an oxidative
cleavage of the CH bond; theoretical studies of metathesis
reactions have also been reviewed.21 EHT studies of the acti-
vation of HH and CH bonds by d0 complexes suggest that
the activation is feasible.14 Metathesis reactions involving late
transition metals in high oxidation states and hydrogenolysis
reactions have also been calculated.19 DFT calculations of RH
(R = H, CH3, SiH3) bond activation by Cp2ScZ,22,23 Cl2Sc
Z 22,24 and Cl2LuZ (Z = H, CH3) 23,25 have shown that the initial
step of the reaction is the formation of an RH adduct which
leads to a ZH adduct through a 4-c-transition state. In con-
trast, the recent DFT calculations of HH bond activation
by Cp2LnH suggest the absence of an initial adduct. The
easily energetically accessible 4-c-transition state connects to
separated Cp2LnH and H2.15
In this paper, DFT calculations have been carried out to
study the reactions shown in eqn. (1)(3) for the entire series
of the lanthanide elements. To save computational time, the
cyclopentadienyl ligand was not explicitly represented but was
modeled by a Cl ligand. The Cl model for Cp or Cp* has been
extensively used in the past 2327 and has led to some controversy
in the case of non d0 species.28,29 In the case of a d0 metal
center and for problems similar to this work, the modeling
seems appropriate and trends (activation energy for activating
RH) are reproduced appropriately.23,25 The σ-bond metathesis
of acetylene with Cl2ZrH and Cl2ZrMe has been studied
with all electron HF and MP2 calculations.27 The activation
energy has been calculated to be lower for Sc than Lu but the
influence of the lanthanide center within its series remains
unknown.22,23,25 DFT calculations on the reaction described in

eqn. (4) have shown that the activation energy is lower for early
lanthanides like neodynium, promethium or samarium than
for late elements like lutetium. Will similar trends apply to
activation of CH4?
Ce, Eu and Yb have two accessible oxidation states,  and 
for Ce,  and  for Eu and Yb. This provides the opportunity
for studying the influence of the lanthanide oxidation state on
the activation of CH4. It should be emphasized that the oxid-
ation state of the lanthanide metal does not vary during the
σ-bond metathesis reaction. Test calculations have shown that
Ce(), Eu(), and Yb() behave very similarly to the other
Ln() elements. For this reason, a complete study was carried
out for Ce(), Eu(), Yb() in order to have a better vision of
the influence of the oxidation state. Only the most relevant sys-
tems were calculated for Ce(), Eu() and Yb() for analysing
the role of the oxidation state on the reactivity.
Computational details
In previous studies 30,31 we have shown that large core relativistic
effective core potentials (RECPs) optimized by the Stuttgart
Dresden Group 3234 are well adapted to the calculation of
the geometries of lanthanide complexes as 4f electrons do not
participate in LnX bonding. Basis sets adapted to the different
RECPs augmented by a polarisation function (f function for
the lanthanide) were used. Chlorine atoms were also treated
with a RECP in combination with the adapted basis set, aug-
mented by a d function for polarisation. Carbon and hydrogen
have been treated with an all-electron 6-31G** basis set. Cal-
culations were carried out at the DFT level using the hybrid
functional B3PW91 35,36 with the Gaussian 98 suite of pro-
grams.37 Geometry optimizations were carried out without any
symmetry restrictions. The nature of the extrema (minimum or
transition structures, TS) was verified with analytical frequency
calculations. ZPE and entropic contributions were calculated
from the approximation of harmonic frequencies. The free
Gibbs energies G are given for T  = 298.15 K.
Results and discussion
Cl as a model for Cp
All lanthanide hydride complexes are dimeric or oligomeric.38
This aspect has not been included since the monomeric species
are the reactive species. The lanthanide complexes in this work
have an empty valence d shell. Our own calculations have
shown that the coordination at the lanthanide center is
essentially identical for Cl2LnH and Cp2LnH.39 The LnH
bond is slightly longer than Cp (average 0.03 Å), in agreement
with the higher electron donating power of Cp. The only strong
discrepancy appears for a cationic cerium complex. As expected
from the presence of a cationic charge, CeH is the shortest
of the LnH bonds in Cp2LnH; however this is not the case
for Cl2CeH in the Cl2LnH series. Therefore the results for
Cl2CeH and most probably those for Cl2CeCH3
 should be
taken with considerable caution. It is not suprising that a more
accurate representation of the donating ability of a ligand may
be especially needed for a proper representation of a cationic
system.
A key point for our study is also a proper representation of
the energy of reaction. The reaction shown in eqn. (2) produces
a metal hydride from methyl complexes. We have thus calcu-
lated the energy of reaction for eqn. (2) for the entire lanthanide
series with Cp and Cl ligands (Table 1). Eqn. (2) is exothermic
for all lanthanide elements (with the exception of Ce in the
case of Cl ligand) although less so for Cl than Cp. Thus, forma-
tion of a monomeric lanthanide hydride is calculated to be
exothermic. Formation of oligomeric species should make the
reaction more exothermic. With the exception of charged
species (Ce, Eu, Yb), the exothermicity is about 8 kcal mol1 for
Cl and 13 kcal mol1 for Cp. The reaction energies, then are
significantly different as could be expected from the difference
in electron donating ability of Cp vs. Cl. The lanthanide center
is more electrophilic with electron accepting Cl than electron
donating Cp. As a consequence, the energy preference for
LnCH3 over LnH is stronger for X = Cl than for Cp as H is
less electron donating than Me. The trend, however, is similar
for Cl and Cp and thus it is possible to use Cl as a model of
Cp (Table 1). One should, however, consider that Cl may not be
an appropriate model for Cp in the cerium complex since the
thermochemistry for eqn. (2) is not properly reproduced. In a
separate study where several models for cyclopentadienyl are
compared, the activation energy for H exchange (eqn. (4)) is
slightly higher for Cl than Cp.39 This is also consistent with Cl
giving less electron density to the lanthanide, which in turns
requires more electron density from the hydride. The activation
energy of eqn. (4) decreases with increasing hydridic character
in the LnH bond, as was shown previously.15 Thus, the acti-
vation energy for bond metathesis calculated with Cl2LnZ is
an upper limit of the value which would be obtained with
Cp2LnZ. In order to validate this hypothesis, a comparison
of the activation barriers has been performed for Cl2LaH and
Cp2LaH. The calculated energy barrier for the reaction going
from the hydride to the methyl complex (reverse of eqn. (2)) is
12.3 kcal mol1 for Cp and 13.3 kcal mol1 for Cl. For the
reaction shown in eqn. (3), the energy barriers are also com-
parable: 65.3 kcal mol1 for Cp and 71.2 kcal mol1 for Cl.
These test calculations show that Cl is an appropriate model
for Cp in these systems. However, we should still keep in mind
that the activation energies calculated for Cl2CeZ may be
very different from that which would have been obtained with
Cp2CeZ. Having established this and recognized the limita-
tions, we now use Cl exclusively as ligand in the following
calculations.
The reactants Cl2LnZ; Z  H, Me
The structure of Cl2LnZ is remarkably independent of the
nature of Z (Tables 2 and 3). The ClLnCl angle is only on
average 2 smaller for Z = H. The pyramidalization at Ln,
measured by the sum of the angles between the ligands, is equal
for the two systems (average difference of 1). The lanthanide
contraction of LnH and LnC respectively are equal to
0.160 Å and 0.165 Å. There are no α-agostic CH bonds in
Cl2LnCH3. Similarly, no α-agostic bonds have been reported
in calculations on Cp2ScCH3 or Cl2LuCH3.2325 A common
concern in studies of bimolecular reactions is establishing the
existence of an adduct between the reactants. In the present
system, such an adduct would lie in a shallow energy well since
it would result from the interaction of a very weak Lewis base
(CH bond) with an electropositive center unable to participate

in backdonation. Not suprisingly, the existence of the adduct
appears to depend on the precise nature of the two partners
and, unfortunately also on the model chosen for the calcula-
tions. Thus, adducts between H2 or CH4 and Cl2LuZ (Z =
H, Me) have been obtained with bond energies varying between
0.4 and 10 kcal mol1.25 Replacing the model Cl ligand by the
full Cp ligand has resulted in the absence of an adduct between
H2 and Cp2LnH for any lanthanide element.15 This is again
consistent with Cp donating more electron density to the lan-
thanide center which in turn is less electrophilic and does not
stabilize as well the very weak incoming Lewis base. Since CH4
and H2 are both poor Lewis bases, the presence of an adduct
between CH4 and Cp2LnH would be at best in an extremely
shallow well if it existed at all. To avoid any artefact linked to
the model, no further searches of any adduct were carried out,
and the activation energies for reactions (1)(3) are considered
as the differences in energy between the 4-c-transition state and
the separated reactants.
Activation of CH4 by Cl2LnH
For the sake of simplicity the reactions which are discussed
correspond to the reaction of CH4 with a lanthanide complex
(the reverse of eqn. (2), eqn. (2), and eqn. (3)). In these
two reactions, CH4 reacts with the lanthanide hydride, with a
different chemio-selectivity. In the reaction shown by eqn. (2),
the CH bond approaches the LnH bond with CH3 closer to
the metal. The 4-c-transition state has the methyl group in an
α-position (1 in Chart 1). In the reaction of eqn. (3), the CH
bond has H nearer the lanthanide and CH3 is at the β-position
(2 in Chart 1).
The β-position is usually considered as disfavored 24,40,41 but

no systematic investigation has been carried out. The transition
states were located for the two directions of approach of
HCH3 and the geometrical parameters are given in Tables 4
and 5. Transition states for α-CH3 are around 14 kcal mol1
above the separated reactants, Cl2LnH  CH4, while the
transition state for β-CH3 is around 73 kcal mol1 above the
separated reactants (Table 6). Reaction (3) is clearly not
feasible. In contrast, the reaction with CH3 at the α-position is
calculated to have a low activation energy (45 kcal mol1 above
separated reactants Cl2LnCH3  H2) (eqn. (2)). The energy
barrier with Cp should be even lower. Thus, the activation of
H2 by Cp2LnCH3 is only marginally more difficult than with
Cp2LnH. Our results can be compared with the previous study
of Cl2LuCH3 done with a frozen core approximation and a
non-hybrid functional.25 Both studies agree on the thermo-
dynamic preference for making LnH complexes. Our study
gives an activation energy closer in agreement with the experi-
mental conditions (room temperature reaction) 42,43 since our
activation energy (9.30 kcal mol1) is significantly lower than
their value (19.6 kcal mol1) above Cl2LnCH3  H2.
With the exception of the charged species (Ce, Eu and Yb)
our calculations show only a marginal influence of the lantha-
nide on the activation energy (averaging 13 kcal mol1) showing
the reaction to be equally as feasible for almost all lanthanide
centers. The significantly lower value calculated for Ce is
probably an artefact of the use of Cl as a model for Cp while
the high activation energies (> 20 kcal mol1) for anionic
Cl2Eu(CH3) and Cl2Yb(CH3)4 are in full agreement with
the high activation energy calculated previously in the case of H
exchange (eqn. (4) and Cp ligand).15 Our results even suggest
that Cp*2Eu(CH3) and Cp*2Yb(CH3), two anionic methyl
complexes, could be stable in the presence of H2 at least at
low temperatures. While the influence of the lanthanide on the
activation energy seems marginal, calculations for H exchange
(eqn. (4)) and the present study both agree that σ-bond meta-
thesis is energetically easier for some early lanthanides like Nd,
Pm or Sm than for late lanthanides like Tm or Lu.
The structure of the 4-c-transition state is similar for all
lanthanides (with the exception of Ce, which will not be dis-
cussed further). It is shown here for La (Fig. 1a). The reaction
occurs in the mirror plane of Cl2La, and the geometry of the
TS resembles the reactants in agreement with the Hammond
principle. The coordination around La has not been modified
in any significant manner from free Cl2LaCH3. The elongation
of the two σ bonds in the transition state is not very large: the
LaC bond is elongated by only 0.13 Å and the HH distance
(0.95 Å) is typical of that found in stretched dihydrogen
complexes.44 The two H centers have a short bond distance to
La with the hydrogen Hβ closer to CH3 having the shorter LaH
distance (LaHα = 2.276 Å, LaHβ = 2.222 Å). The most
striking feature of the transition state is the near aligment of
CH3 with the HH vector (HαHβC = 165 for La). The C3
axis of CH3 is no longer directed toward La as in the starting
reactant structure. The C3 axis of the CH3 group makes an
angle of 33 with the CLa direction and of 27 with the CHβ
direction; therefore, the sp3 hybrid orbital of CH3 does not
point towards La but tilts towards the approaching H. The
carbon is best viewed as being at the center of a distorted tri-
gonal bipyramid in which La occupies an apical site and the
transfering hydrogen, Hβ, occupies an equatorial site. This
transition state is indicative of a proton transfering from H2 to

the methyl anion, leaving behind a hydrid which is stabilized by
the La cation. While this reaction may be regarded as a σ-bond
metathesis, it can also be viewed as another exemple of the
heterolytic cleavage of an H2 coordinated to a Lewis acid with
the CH3 group acting as a Lewis base.45
Since the CH3
 anion is interacting with the approaching
H
β and the cationic Cl2Ln center, it is possible to consider that
a formal LnCH4
 is being formed in the TS. The extreme
fluxionality of this species is well known; a distorted trigonal
bipyramid structure is therefore appropriate. Furthermore,
penta-coordination with an overall positive charge is energetic-
ally accessible for a carbon center.
The very high energy of the transition state with CH3 at the
β-position (Fig. 1b, Tables 5 and 6) can be easily understood

from the conclusions of the preceeding discussion. The CH3
group is bound to two hydrides that are themselves in close
proximity to the Cl2La fragment. The transition state can then
be best viewed as a CH5
 group which is η2 bound to Cl2La.
The carbon is at the center of a trigonal bipyramid in which La
is closer to the axial hydride (CHα = 1.838 Å, LaHα = 2.166 Å)
than to the equatorial hydride (CHα = 1.307 Å, LaHα =
3.015 Å), in agreement with the higher electron density
carried by the apical ligand in a hypervalent CH5
 system.
This transition state with CH3 at the β position is particularly
high in energy as carbon cannot stabilize a hypervalent anionic
system.

Activation of CH4 by Cl2LnCH3
Cp*2LuCH3 activates CH4, resulting in the exchange of methyl
groups and formation of a molecule of methane (eqn. (1)); no
ethane or Cp*2LnH is observed. Using Cl as a model of Cp,
the thermodynamic preference of the reaction was examined.
The formation of ethane and a Cl2LnH bond is thermo-
dynamically endothermic (Table 7) with an average value of
11.3 kcal mol1 for Cl and 5.7 kcal mol1 for Cp. The anionic
species Cp2EuCH3
 and Cp2YbCH3
 would give an athermic
reaction with an even greater preference for forming the LnH
bond than the other lanthanide elements. Formation of ethane
is thus thermodynamically unfavourable, as expected from the
weaker energy of an C(sp3)C(sp3) bond in comparison to
C(sp3)H. The need to introduce a CH3 group at the β-position
in the transition state would also make the formation of ethane
kinetically unfavourable. Because of this, the reaction of
eqn. (1) has been studied further (Tables 8 and 9). The energy of
the transition state is between 15.6 and 19.7 kcal mol1 above
the separated reactants. The slightly lower energy calculated for
Ce cannot be trusted. Reaction (1) is thus more difficult than
the reverse of eqn. (2) as is expected because of the additional
presence of a CH3 group as a part of the 4-c-transition state.
This is in agreement with the experimental observation that
heating was required for the reaction to proceed in the case
of Lu.1 The nature of the lanthanide does not influence the
activation energy to a great degree. In particular, the activation
energies for anionic Cl2Eu and Cl2Yb are only slightly higher
than for the neutral species. It is also remarkable that the
trend obtained for the H exchange reaction (eqn. (4)) or for the
activation of H2 by Cl2LnCH3 (eqn. (2)) which both shows an
increase of the activation energy with later lanthanides is not

apparent for eqn. (1). However, confirmation of this result with
full Cp ligands in the calculations is needed.
The structures of the transition states are also very similar
for all lanthanide elements; The TS for La is shown in Fig. 2.
The two LaC distances are equal at the TS. The LaC bond
has been elongated from 2.449 Å in the reactant to 2.604 Å in
the transition state. The transfering H is equidistant from the
two carbon centers (1.448 Å in the case of La). The CHC
angle is equal to 177.7 resulting in short LaH distances, 2.192
Å. As a consequence, the CLaC angle is 67.6. The C3 axis
of the two CH3 groups is strongly tilted away from La as shown
by the angle of 60 between the C3 axis of CH3 and the CLa
vector. The C3 axis of the CH3 group is much more tilted
toward the transferring H (angle of 24 in case of La). This
reaction is thus best viewed as a proton transfering between
two CH3
 groups in the vicinity of a La cation. Since the role
of the lanthanide in the transition state is mostly to stabilize
the negative charge on the anionic methyl groups, the highest
energy of the transition state is obtained for the anionic
fragments like Cl2Eu and Cl2Yb.
Influence of the oxidation state
The reactivity of all lanthanides metal was calculated to be very
similar with the exception of Cl2Ce(R), Cl2Eu(R), Cl2Yb(R)
(R = H, CH3). To confirm this, the neutral analogues for which
the oxidation state of the lanthanide center is  were con-
sidered. They behave very similarly to the other Ln() com-
plexes. Thus the activation energy for eqn. (2) is 13.23 kcal
mol1 for Cl2Ce(H), 12.81 kcal mol1 for Cl2Eu(H), and 14.21
kcal mol1 for Cl2Yb(H). For the reaction of eqn. (1) the corre-
sponding values are 16.87 kcal mol1 Cl2Ce(CH3), 15.79 kcal
mol1 Cl2Eu(CH3), 16.21 kcal mol1 (Cl2Yb(CH3). The role of
the charge has already been discussed in the study on the acti-
vation of H2.15 The positive charge decreases the nucleophilicity
of R while the negative charge makes the lanthanide center

much less able to stabilize the strong negative charge in the
[R    H    R] fragment (R, R = H or CH3) at the transition
state. Thus while the f electrons play no active chemical role,
the charge strongly influences the reaction and deactivates the
complex in the metathesis reaction.
Conclusions
Calculations show the reactions described in eqn. (1) and (2)
to be kinetically accessible. While overall the reaction is a σ-
bond metathesis with a 4-c4-el transition state, the study with
CH3 brings new information that was not apparent in the case
of the H exchange process (eqn. (4)). The reactions are in fact
best viewed as a transfer of a proton between two anionic
groups in the proximity of a lanthanide center. It is remarkable
that the lanthanide is able to carry out reactions that are not
seen with Grignard reagents or alkyllithiums in which an
anionic alkyl group is in the vicinity of a cationic metal center.
The larger size of the lanthanide ion may be one factor which
makes eqn. (1) possible. A smaller cation is probably not able
to stabilize the two R groups during the transfer of H.
However, the lanthanide center is unable to stabilize the CH5
anion which is formed in the transition state of the reaction
in eqn. (3). Substitution at the carbon or replacement of CH3
by groups like SiR3 or a phenyl group which better stabilize a
more hypervalent anion 46 could make H exchange in eqn. (3)
accessible. This is under study in our group.
