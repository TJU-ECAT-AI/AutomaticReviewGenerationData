Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be mainly metadata about a journal article on alkane activation and functionalization with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, but does not provide any specific details related to the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物、氧化铝负载的钍氢化物或它们在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质的任何信息。这段文字主要是关于一篇讨论均相过渡金属催化剂的烷烃活化和官能化的期刊文章的元数据，但并未提供与问题相关的任何具体细节。因此，无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be a general overview of alkane CH activation and functionalization with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, but does not provide specific details about the catalysts mentioned in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot compare and contrast their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. The document also lacks information on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

所给文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物、氧化铝负载的钍氢化物或它们在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质的任何信息。该文档似乎是对烷烃CH活化和均相过渡金属催化剂官能化的一般性概述，但没有提供问题中提到的催化剂的具体细节。由于缺乏相关文本中的相关信息，我无法比较和对比它们的制备、结构、催化性质或在H/D交换和烷烃复分解中的机理。该文档也缺乏关于反应速率、选择性以及σ键复分解、氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的信息。
