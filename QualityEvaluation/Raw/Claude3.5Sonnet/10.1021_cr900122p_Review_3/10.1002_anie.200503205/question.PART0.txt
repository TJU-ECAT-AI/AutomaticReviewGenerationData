Surface versus Molecular Siloxy Ligands in Well-DefinedOlefin Metathesis Catalysts: [{(RO)3SiO}Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)]
Graphical Abstract
Surface organometallic chemistry: Similar electronic properties of molecular and surface siloxy ligands in 1m and 1 were revealed by a structural investigation with solid-state NMR spectroscopy and a reactivity study in olefin metathesis. Despite similar initial turnover frequencies, the silica-supported catalyst 1 is more stable than 1m and allows it to achieve higher turnovers, thus showing the advantage of site isolation on surfaces.
We report herein the synthesis and characterization of [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (1), a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst for olefin metathesis, and its molecular equivalents 1m and 1n.
We recently reported the preparation and characterization of highly active heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalysts [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)].13 This system has shown better activity than the best Re-based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and comparable initial activities to Mo- and W-based homogeneous olefin metathesis catalysts. In homogeneous catalysis, well-defined Mo complexes such as [(RF6O)2Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)]47 (RF6=(CF3)2(CH3)C) are much better catalysts than their Re equivalents [(RF6O)2Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)].8,9 However, preparing a supported equivalent to [(RF6O)2Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)] has remained a challenge.1015 In surface organometallic chemistry,16 the formation of a Mo alkylidene complex requires the use of well-defined Mo alkyl alkylidene molecular precursors, which have become available only recently as [Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] (2; Ar=2,6-diisopropylphenyl).1719 Since the surface of silica partially dehydroxylated at 700C (SiO2-(700)) can be compared to a bulky monodentate ligand,16 we investigated the reaction of 2 with SiO2-(700) in order to generate a well-defined supported olefin metathesis catalyst.
When immersed in a solution of 2 in pentane, a SiO2-(700) disk immediately turned yellow. After 2 h, the disk was washed three times with pentane, dried under vacuum for 1 h at 25C, and analyzed by IR spectroscopy. The IR peaks associated with the surface silanol groups at 3747 cm1 had disappeared while new IR bands associated with ν(CH) and δ(CH) of hydrocarbyl ligands appeared in the regions of 30002700 and 15001350 cm1, respectively (see Supporting Information). Furthermore, the IR bands at 3065 and 3027 cm1 are attributed to ν(CH) of the arylimido group. During these steps the surface silanol groups reacted, as their corresponding IR bands at 3747 cm1 did not reappear. Preparation of larger quantities of this solid was performed by using calibrated silica (4060 mesh) partially dehydroxylated at 700C. When a mixture of SiO2-(700) (0.26 mmolg1 SiOH) and 2 in pentane was stirred for 2 h at 25C, surface organometallic complex 1 was formed together with 1 equivalent of 2,2-dimethylpropane (Scheme 1). The yellow solid thus obtained contains 1.72.1 wt% of Mo, which corresponds to 0.170.21 mmol of Mo per gram of solids, in agreement with consumption of most of the surface silanol groups (7080%). Moreover, the materials contain on average 233C and 1.00.3N per grafted Mo (as obtained from elemental analysis), consistent with the proposed structure 1, for which 22C/Mo and 1N/Mo are expected. Furthermore, the 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectrum of 1 (Figure 1a) displays distinct signals at δ=11.7 (CHtBu, 1H), 6.8 (CH, 3H), 3.5 (CHMe2, 2H), and 0.9 ppm (CH3, 30H). The signal of the methylene protons in the position α to Mo is only observed as a shoulder centered around δ=1.9 ppm. The presence of relatively sharp signals for a solid-state NMR spectrum (Δν1/2=390 Hz) shows that 1H1H dipolar coupling is weak, the ligands undergo rapid restricted motion, and the species are dispersed. A 2D 1H1H homonuclear correlation NMR spectrum recorded with the DUMBO-1 homonuclear dipolar decoupling sequence20 in t1 resulted in a slight improvement in the line width of the 1H NMR spectrum (Δν1/2=260 Hz; Figure 1b), in contrast to the much larger effect that is observed for bulk materials. This results, however, in a better resolution of the signal at δ=1.9 ppm (Figure 1c).

The 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS spectrum contains 11 resolved peaks (see Figure 2a and Supporting Information), which can be tentatively assigned as follows: δ=22 (CH(CH3)2), 29 (CHC(CH3)3), 31 (CH2C(CH3)3), 36 (CH2CMe3), 46 (CHCMe3), 56 (CH2tBu), 122 (Cpara), 126 (Cmeta), 145 (Cortho), 153 (Cipso), and 279 ppm (CHtBu); the signal of the alkylidene carbon atom at δ=279 ppm is barely observable. [(SiO)Mo(NAr)(*CHtBu)(*CH2tBu)] (1*), 33% 13C-labeled on the carbon atom α to Mo, unambiguously displays signals for both the methine (MoCHtBu) and methylene carbon atoms (MoCH2tBu) at δ=279 and 56 ppm, respectively (Figure 2a). Furthermore, using the 2D 1H13C dipolar HETCOR NMR method21,22 (see Figure 2b and Supporting Information) with different contact times (1 and 5 ms) allowed resolution and assignment of all signals of the 13C spectrum (see Supporting Information).22,23 The carbene (CHtBu) and methylene (CH2tBu) signals gave correlations (δH [ppm] in F1; δC [ppm] in F2) at (11.7; 279) and (1.9; 56), respectively. A cross-peak is observed between the proton at δ=3.5 ppm (CHMe2) and the carbon atom at δ=29 ppm, showing that CHMe2 (not observed before) also appears at this chemical shift.

The recycle delay was set to 1 s, and the contact time for the CP step was 1 ms. An exponential line broadening of 80 Hz was applied before Fourier transformation. b) 2D 1H13C dipolar HETCOR solid-state NMR spectrum of 1* with a contact time of 1 ms (short-range HETCOR). A total of 32 t1 were collected with 4096 scans each. Left: Projection along F2. Asterisks denote spinning side bands.
The corresponding molecular complexes 1m and 1n, with a molecular monosiloxy equivalent, were prepared by using (RO)3SiOH in place of a siloxy group of the silica surface (Scheme 1).2426 The reaction of 2 with 1 equivalent of [(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiOH] in C6D6 or pentane for 2 h at 25C quantitatively gave [(c-C5H9)7Si7O12SiO)Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (1m) and tBuCH3. The closeness of the NMR data of 1m to those of 1 fully supports the assignments (see Supporting Information). Complex 1m shows resonances at δ=12.05 and 281.2 ppm (1JCH=110 Hz) for the alkylidene ligand in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively, which is consistent with a syn-alkylidene complex.17 A similar reaction carried out over 15 h between 2 and [(tBuO)3SiOH] yielded [{(tBuO)3SiO}Mo(NAr)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (1n), which displayed similar NMR data and whose X-ray crystal structure (not shown) showed it to be the expected syn isomer.
When 1 is contacted with 1350 equivalents of propene at 25C (batch reactor), equilibrium is reached within 20 min (around 30% conversion, E/Z-butene ratio=2.6) with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.0 mol(molMo)1s1, which is four times faster than with [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)] (TOF=0.25 mol(molRe)1s1).1,2 Moreover, roughly 0.7 equivalents of a 2.7:1 mixture of 3,3-dimethylbutene and 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene is formed, as previously observed for [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)],1,2 and shows that initiation is almost quantitative, in agreement with a well-defined system. Moreover, the ratio of cross-metathesis products is in full agreement with the following model: the favored pathway involves reaction intermediates that minimize the interaction between the alkyl substituents (Scheme 2).27

Moreover, the self-metathesis of 0.5M solutions of 1-octene and ethyl oleate in toluene in the presence of 1% of 1 gives the equilibrated mixture in 10 and 60 min, respectively (Table 1). The respective initial TOFs are 0.06 and 0.04 mol(molMo)1s1, which is very close to those obtained for [(SiO)Re(CtBu)(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)].28 The initial rates with the corresponding molecular complex 1m are similar, but the reaction times needed to reach the same conversion (thermodynamic equilibrium) are much longer, which shows that, in this case, decomposition is faster. On the other hand, the quasi-inactivity of molecular complex 2 illustrates the activating effect of the siloxyl group.3,29

In conclusion, we have shown that the molecular and surface complexes 1 and 1m are electronically very similar in terms of both their comparable NMR data and initial TOFs in olefin metathesis. Nonetheless, the supported catalyst has a longer lifetime under catalytic conditions, which shows that the effect of active-site isolation prevents some deactivation pathways such as dimerization of reactive intermediates.30 Moreover, the formation of about 0.7 equivalents of cross-metathesis product shows that most of the surface complex generates the active species, in agreement with a well-defined heterogeneous catalyst.
