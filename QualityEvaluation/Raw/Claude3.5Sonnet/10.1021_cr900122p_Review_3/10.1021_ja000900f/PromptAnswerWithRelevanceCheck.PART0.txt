Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be about a rhenium catalyst for olefin metathesis, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is no data provided about the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of zirconium or thorium hydrides, nor any details on their mechanisms in H/D exchange or alkane metathesis reactions. The document also lacks information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

所给文献不包含任何关于比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的相关信息。该文档似乎是关于烯烃复分解反应的铼催化剂，与所问问题无关。文献中没有提供关于锆或钍氢化物的制备、结构或催化性质的数据，也没有关于它们在H/D交换或烷烃复分解反应中机理的详细信息。文档还缺乏有关反应速率、选择性或σ键复分解、氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的信息。因此，基于给定的文献无法回答这个问题。

This document does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The literature appears to be about a rhenium catalyst for olefin metathesis, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is insufficient information provided to answer the question about preparation, structure, catalytic properties, mechanisms, reaction rates, selectivity, or roles of different processes in C-H activation reactions involving zirconium or thorium hydrides.
