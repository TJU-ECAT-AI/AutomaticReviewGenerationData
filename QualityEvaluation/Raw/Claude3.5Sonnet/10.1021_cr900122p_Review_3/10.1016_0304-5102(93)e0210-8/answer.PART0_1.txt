The literature does not provide direct information comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does discuss the properties and mechanisms of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are prepared by adsorbing organoactinide complexes like Th(η5-allyl)4 on dehydroxylated alumina (DA). This yields coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for demanding chemical transformations.

The structure of the active sites is believed to involve cation-like organothorium centers with some ancillary ligation. The exact nature of these sites is not fully determined, but they are thought to be electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated.

In C-H bond activation reactions, these catalysts show high activity for H/D exchange in alkanes. The mechanism is proposed to involve:

1. σ-bond metathesis: Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic pathway
2. Deuterolysis: The reverse of the σ-bond metathesis step
3. β-H elimination and readdition: For cycloalkane skeletal isomerization

The reaction rates for alkane C-H/C-D exchange are reported to be comparable to or exceed those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts. The selectivity favors primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and less hindered over more hindered positions.

While chain walking is not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism for cycloalkane isomerization involves a process that could be considered a form of chain walking, where β-H elimination is followed by readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

The catalysts show high activity for arene hydrogenation as well, rivaling platinum metal catalysts. However, the mechanism for arene hydrogenation appears to be different from the alkane activation mechanism.

Overall, these alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate significant potential for C-H bond activation reactions, showing high activity and some selectivity in both H/D exchange and alkane isomerization processes.

文献中没有直接比较硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。但是，它确实讨论了氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质和机理。

氧化铝负载的钍氢化物是通过将有机锕系络合物如Th(η5-烯丙基)4吸附在脱羟基氧化铝(DA)上制备的。这产生了配位不饱和的、高活性的催化剂，可用于要求苛刻的化学转化。

活性位点的结构被认为涉及阳离子状的有机钍中心，具有一些辅助配体。这些位点的确切性质尚未完全确定，但它们被认为是亲电性和配位不饱和的。

在C-H键活化反应中，这些催化剂对烷烃的H/D交换表现出高活性。proposed机理包括：

1. σ键复分解：通过四中心、异裂途径形成Th-C键和HD消除
2. 氘解：σ键复分解步骤的逆过程
3. β-H消除和重加成：用于环烷烃骨架异构化

烷烃C-H/C-D交换的反应速率据报道可与或超过常规第9族杂多相烷烃活化催化剂。选择性倾向于伯 > 仲 > 叔C-H键，以及位阻较小的位置优于位阻较大的位置。

虽然没有明确提到链行走，但环烷烃异构化的机理涉及一个可以被认为是链行走形式的过程，其中β-H消除后接着Th+-H重新加成到双键的另一面。

这些催化剂对芳烃加氢也表现出高活性，可与铂族金属催化剂媲美。然而，芳烃加氢的机理似乎与烷烃活化机理不同。

总的来说，这些氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中展现出显著潜力，在H/D交换和烷烃异构化过程中都表现出高活性和一定的选择性。
