The literature does not provide direct information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, we can discuss the properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions based on the given information:

Preparation and Structure:
Thorium complexes are adsorbed on dehydroxylated alumina (DA) to create coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts. Specifically, Th(η5-allyl)4 is supported on DA. Only about 8±1% of the thorium surface sites are catalytically significant.

Catalytic Properties:
These catalysts are highly active for arene hydrogenation and alkane activation. They can perform these reactions in slurry conditions at 90°C and 30-180 psi hydrogen pressure.

Mechanisms:
The mechanism for C-H bond activation involves electrophilic four-center activation processes. For alkane activation and isomerization, the proposed mechanism includes:

1. Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway.
2. Deuterolysis (the reverse of the above step).
3. Cycloalkane skeletal isomerization via β-H elimination and readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

The active sites appear to have sterically significant, non-hydridic ancillary ligation, which likely influences their reactivity and selectivity.

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
While specific rates are not provided for C-H activation, the catalysts are described as highly active. The selectivity in alkane activation favors primary over secondary over tertiary C-H bonds, and less hindered over more hindered positions.

The roles of σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis are evident in the proposed mechanism. Chain walking is implicated in the cycloalkane isomerization process through the β-H elimination and readdition steps.

In summary, alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate high activity and selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions, operating through a mechanism that involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking processes.

由于文献中没有提供有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物的直接信息，因此无法进行完整的比较。但是，我们可以根据给出的信息讨论氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质：

制备和结构：
钍配合物被吸附在脱羟基氧化铝（DA）上，形成配位不饱和的高活性催化剂。具体来说，Th(η5-烯丙基)4被负载在DA上。只有约8±1%的钍表面位点具有催化活性。

催化性质：
这些催化剂对芳烃氢化和烷烃活化具有高活性。它们可以在90°C和30-180 psi氢压的浆液条件下进行这些反应。

机理：
C-H键活化的机理涉及亲电的四中心活化过程。对于烷烃活化和异构化，提出的机理包括：

1. 通过四中心、异裂的σ-键复分解途径形成Th-C键和HD消除。
2. 氘解（上述步骤的逆过程）。
3. 通过β-H消除和Th+-H重新加成到双键的另一面实现环烷烃骨架异构化。

活性位点似乎具有立体显著的、非氢化物的辅助配体，这可能影响其反应性和选择性。

反应速率和选择性：
虽然没有提供C-H活化的具体速率，但这些催化剂被描述为高活性。烷烃活化的选择性倾向于一级>二级>三级C-H键，以及空间位阻较小的位置优于位阻较大的位置。

σ-键复分解和氢解在提出的机理中起着明显的作用。链行走过程通过β-H消除和重新加成步骤参与了环烷烃的异构化过程。

总之，氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中表现出高活性和选择性，其机理涉及σ-键复分解、氢解和链行走过程。
