The literature does not provide direct information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, so a complete comparison cannot be made. However, we can discuss the properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions:

Preparation: Th(η5-allyl)4 is adsorbed on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA) to yield coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts.

Structure: The active sites are electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated, with non-negligible ancillary ligation having steric and stereochemical consequences. Only about 8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant.

Catalytic properties:
1. Arene hydrogenation: Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of ~25,000 h-1 per active site.
2. Alkane C-H activation: Cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 occurs at ~1,300 h-1 per active site.
3. Selectivity: C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity, favoring primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered sites.

Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves electrophilic four-center activation processes. For alkane activation, it includes:
1. Th-C bond formation
2. HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway
3. Deuterolysis (the microscopic reverse of the previous step)

The mechanism does not explicitly mention chain walking, but it does involve cycloalkane skeletal isomerization via β-H elimination and readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

Reaction rates are high, with turnover frequencies in the thousands per hour for both arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation. The selectivity does not follow C-H bond dissociation energies, suggesting that steric factors play a significant role in determining reactivity.

文献中没有直接提供有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物的信息，因此无法进行完整的比较。但我们可以讨论氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质：

制备：Th(η5-烯丙基)4被吸附在脱羟基γ-氧化铝（DA）上，产生配位不饱和的高活性催化剂。

结构：活性位点是亲电性的和配位不饱和的，具有不可忽视的辅助配体，这些配体具有立体和立体化学的影响。只有约8±1%的表面钍位点具有催化意义。

催化性质：
1. 芳烃氢化：苯的还原以每个活性位点~25,000 h-1的转化频率进行。
2. 烷烃C-H活化：环己烷与D2的C-H交换以每个活性位点~1,300 h-1的速率进行。
3. 选择性：C-H官能化具有显著的选择性，倾向于一级 > 二级 > 三级C-H键，以及空间位阻小 > 空间位阻大的位点。

机理：提出的机理涉及亲电性的四中心活化过程。对于烷烃活化，它包括：
1. Th-C键形成
2. 通过四中心、异裂的σ键复分解途径进行HD消除
3. 氘解（前一步骤的微观逆过程）

该机理没有明确提到链行走，但确实涉及环烷烃骨架异构化，通过β-H消除和Th+-H对双键另一面的重新加成来实现。

反应速率很高，芳烃氢化和烷烃C-H活化的转化频率都在每小时数千次。选择性不遵循C-H键解离能，表明立体因素在决定反应活性中起着重要作用。

The literature does not provide direct information comparing silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does discuss the properties and mechanisms of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.

Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are prepared by adsorbing organoactinide complexes like Th(η5-allyl)4 on dehydroxylated alumina (DA). This yields coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for demanding chemical transformations.

The structure of the active sites is believed to involve cation-like organothorium centers with some ancillary ligation. The exact nature of these sites is not fully determined, but they are thought to be electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated.

In C-H bond activation reactions, these catalysts show high activity for H/D exchange in alkanes. The mechanism is proposed to involve:

1. σ-bond metathesis: Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic pathway
2. Deuterolysis: The reverse of the σ-bond metathesis step
3. β-H elimination and readdition: For cycloalkane skeletal isomerization

The reaction rates for alkane C-H/C-D exchange are reported to be comparable to or exceed those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts. The selectivity favors primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and less hindered over more hindered positions.

While chain walking is not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism for cycloalkane isomerization involves a process that could be considered a form of chain walking, where β-H elimination is followed by readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

The catalysts show high activity for arene hydrogenation as well, rivaling platinum metal catalysts. However, the mechanism for arene hydrogenation appears to be different from the alkane activation mechanism.

Overall, these alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate significant potential for C-H bond activation reactions, showing high activity and some selectivity in both H/D exchange and alkane isomerization processes.

文献中没有直接比较硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。但是，它确实讨论了氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质和机理。

氧化铝负载的钍氢化物是通过将有机锕系络合物如Th(η5-烯丙基)4吸附在脱羟基氧化铝(DA)上制备的。这产生了配位不饱和的、高活性的催化剂，可用于要求苛刻的化学转化。

活性位点的结构被认为涉及阳离子状的有机钍中心，具有一些辅助配体。这些位点的确切性质尚未完全确定，但它们被认为是亲电性和配位不饱和的。

在C-H键活化反应中，这些催化剂对烷烃的H/D交换表现出高活性。proposed机理包括：

1. σ键复分解：通过四中心、异裂途径形成Th-C键和HD消除
2. 氘解：σ键复分解步骤的逆过程
3. β-H消除和重加成：用于环烷烃骨架异构化

烷烃C-H/C-D交换的反应速率据报道可与或超过常规第9族杂多相烷烃活化催化剂。选择性倾向于伯 > 仲 > 叔C-H键，以及位阻较小的位置优于位阻较大的位置。

虽然没有明确提到链行走，但环烷烃异构化的机理涉及一个可以被认为是链行走形式的过程，其中β-H消除后接着Th+-H重新加成到双键的另一面。

这些催化剂对芳烃加氢也表现出高活性，可与铂族金属催化剂媲美。然而，芳烃加氢的机理似乎与烷烃活化机理不同。

总的来说，这些氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中展现出显著潜力，在H/D交换和烷烃异构化过程中都表现出高活性和一定的选择性。

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it offers detailed information on the alumina-supported thorium system:

Preparation and structure: Th(η5-allyl)4 is adsorbed on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA), yielding coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts. Only about 8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant.

Catalytic properties: The Th(η5-allyl)4/DA system is highly active for arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation. It can catalyze the hydrogenation of various substituted arenes, with a rate order of benzene > toluene > p-xylene > naphthalene.

C-H bond activation: The system promotes rapid C-H/C-D exchange in alkanes, with turnover frequencies comparable to or exceeding those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts.

Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves electrophilic four-center activation processes. For alkane activation, it involves endothermic Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The system shows high activity for arene hydrogenation, with turnover frequencies up to 25,000 h-1 for benzene. In alkane activation, it demonstrates substantial selectivity, favoring primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and less hindered over more hindered positions.

The roles of σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis are explicitly mentioned in the mechanism. Chain walking is not directly discussed but may be involved in the isomerization processes observed for cycloalkanes.

While the document provides detailed information on the alumina-supported thorium system, it does not offer comparative data for silica-supported zirconium hydrides, making a direct comparison impossible based solely on this text.

The literature does not provide direct information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, so a full comparison cannot be made. However, we can discuss the properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions based on the given information:

Preparation and Structure:
Thorium complexes are adsorbed on dehydroxylated alumina (DA) to create coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts. Specifically, Th(η5-allyl)4 is supported on DA. Only about 8±1% of the thorium surface sites are catalytically significant.

Catalytic Properties:
These catalysts are highly active for arene hydrogenation and alkane activation. They can perform these reactions in slurry conditions at 90°C and 30-180 psi hydrogen pressure.

Mechanisms:
The mechanism for C-H bond activation involves electrophilic four-center activation processes. For alkane activation and isomerization, the proposed mechanism includes:

1. Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway.
2. Deuterolysis (the reverse of the above step).
3. Cycloalkane skeletal isomerization via β-H elimination and readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

The active sites appear to have sterically significant, non-hydridic ancillary ligation, which likely influences their reactivity and selectivity.

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
While specific rates are not provided for C-H activation, the catalysts are described as highly active. The selectivity in alkane activation favors primary over secondary over tertiary C-H bonds, and less hindered over more hindered positions.

The roles of σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis are evident in the proposed mechanism. Chain walking is implicated in the cycloalkane isomerization process through the β-H elimination and readdition steps.

In summary, alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate high activity and selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions, operating through a mechanism that involves σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking processes.
