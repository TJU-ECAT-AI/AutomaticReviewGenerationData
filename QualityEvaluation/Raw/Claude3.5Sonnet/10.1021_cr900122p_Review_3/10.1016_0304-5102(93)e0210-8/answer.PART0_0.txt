[1] "The adsorption of organoactinide complexes on dehydroxylated alumina (DA ) yields coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for several demanding chemical transformations."

[5] "The mechanisms for the above processes are discussed in terms of electrophilic four-center activation processes in which the active sites appear to bear sterically significant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation."

[6] "As noted above, studies of benzene reduction with Dz revealed C-H/C-D exchange in the cyclohexane product only after benzene conversion was complete. This observation prompted more detailed studies of hydrocarbon activation."

The literature does not provide direct information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, so a complete comparison cannot be made. However, we can discuss the properties of alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions:

Preparation: Th(η5-allyl)4 is adsorbed on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA) to yield coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts.

Structure: The active sites are electrophilic and coordinatively unsaturated, with non-negligible ancillary ligation having steric and stereochemical consequences. Only about 8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant.

Catalytic properties:
1. Arene hydrogenation: Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of ~25,000 h-1 per active site.
2. Alkane C-H activation: Cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 occurs at ~1,300 h-1 per active site.
3. Selectivity: C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity, favoring primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered sites.

Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves electrophilic four-center activation processes. For alkane activation, it includes:
1. Th-C bond formation
2. HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway
3. Deuterolysis (the microscopic reverse of the previous step)

The mechanism does not explicitly mention chain walking, but it does involve cycloalkane skeletal isomerization via β-H elimination and readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

Reaction rates are high, with turnover frequencies in the thousands per hour for both arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation. The selectivity does not follow C-H bond dissociation energies, suggesting that steric factors play a significant role in determining reactivity.

文献中没有直接提供有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物的信息，因此无法进行完整的比较。但我们可以讨论氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质：

制备：Th(η5-烯丙基)4被吸附在脱羟基γ-氧化铝（DA）上，产生配位不饱和的高活性催化剂。

结构：活性位点是亲电性的和配位不饱和的，具有不可忽视的辅助配体，这些配体具有立体和立体化学的影响。只有约8±1%的表面钍位点具有催化意义。

催化性质：
1. 芳烃氢化：苯的还原以每个活性位点~25,000 h-1的转化频率进行。
2. 烷烃C-H活化：环己烷与D2的C-H交换以每个活性位点~1,300 h-1的速率进行。
3. 选择性：C-H官能化具有显著的选择性，倾向于一级 > 二级 > 三级C-H键，以及空间位阻小 > 空间位阻大的位点。

机理：提出的机理涉及亲电性的四中心活化过程。对于烷烃活化，它包括：
1. Th-C键形成
2. 通过四中心、异裂的σ键复分解途径进行HD消除
3. 氘解（前一步骤的微观逆过程）

该机理没有明确提到链行走，但确实涉及环烷烃骨架异构化，通过β-H消除和Th+-H对双键另一面的重新加成来实现。

反应速率很高，芳烃氢化和烷烃C-H活化的转化频率都在每小时数千次。选择性不遵循C-H键解离能，表明立体因素在决定反应活性中起着重要作用。
