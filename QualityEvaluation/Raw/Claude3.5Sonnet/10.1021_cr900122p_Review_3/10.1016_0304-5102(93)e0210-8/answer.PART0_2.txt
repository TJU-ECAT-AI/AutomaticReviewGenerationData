The literature provides information mainly on alumina-supported thorium hydrides, with limited direct comparison to silica-supported zirconium hydrides. However, we can discuss the properties of the thorium system based on the available information:

Preparation: Th(η5-allyl)4 is supported on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA) to create the catalyst.

Structure: The active sites are described as coordinatively unsaturated and highly active. They appear to bear sterically significant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation. Thorium remains in the +4 oxidation state.

Catalytic properties:
1. The catalyst is active for arene hydrogenation and alkane activation.
2. C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity.
3. The order of reactivity is: primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered.

Mechanism: 
1. The proposed mechanism involves electrophilic four-center activation processes.
2. For alkane activation, the mechanism includes Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway.
3. The process is presumably endothermic.

The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes. Additionally, there is no direct comparison to silica-supported zirconium hydrides in the given text.

该文献主要提供了有关氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，对硅胶负载的锆氢化物的直接比较有限。然而，我们可以根据可用信息讨论钍系统的性质：

制备：Th(η5-allyl)4负载在脱羟基γ-氧化铝（DA）上以创建催化剂。

结构：活性位点被描述为配位不饱和且高度活性。它们似乎带有立体上显著的、非氢化物的辅助配体。钍保持在+4氧化态。

催化性能：
1. 该催化剂对芳烃加氢和烷烃活化具有活性。
2. C-H官能化具有显著的选择性。
3. 反应活性顺序为：伯 > 仲 > 叔C-H键，以及立体位阻小 > 立体位阻大。

机理：
1. 提出的机理涉及亲电的四中心活化过程。
2. 对于烷烃活化，机理包括Th-C键形成和通过四中心、异裂σ-键复分解途径的HD消除。
3. 该过程可能是吸热的。

文献没有提供关于反应速率或氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的具体信息。此外，给定的文本中没有与硅胶负载的锆氢化物的直接比较。
