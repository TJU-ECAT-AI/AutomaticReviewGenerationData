[1] "The adsorption of organoactinide complexes on dehydroxylated alumina (DA ) yields coor- dinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for several demanding chemical transformations."

[2] "Thus, in the case of Th(qs-allyl), supported on dehydroxylated y-alumina (DA), facile arene hydrogenation and alkane activation processes can be effected in slurry reactions at 90C and PHI = 30-180 psi."

[3] "Active site characterization using DzO poisoning, hydrogenolysis, and CH&l dosing indicates d 8 f 1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant."

[4] "The mechanisms for the above processes are discussed in terms of electro- philic four-center activation processes in which the active sites appear to bear sterically signif- icant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation."

[5] "Table 3 shows the wide variety of substituted arenes that can be hydro- genated by Th( $-allyl),/DA. The rate ordering follows the trend ben- zene > toluene >p-xylene > naphthalene."

[6] "As noted above, studies of benzene reduction with Dz revealed C-H/C-D exchange in the cyclohexane product only after benzene conversion was com- plete. This observation prompted more detailed studies of hydrocarbon acti- vation."

[7] "Based on the same two reasonable assumptions as for the arene hydrogenation (vide supra), a plau- sible mechanistic scenario for the activation and isomerization of alkanes is summarized in Scheme 4. The mechanistic sequence invokes presumably en- dothermic Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four- center, heterolytic a-bond metathesis pathway"

The literature does not provide direct comparisons between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it offers detailed information on the alumina-supported thorium system:

Preparation and structure: Th(η5-allyl)4 is adsorbed on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA), yielding coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts. Only about 8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant.

Catalytic properties: The Th(η5-allyl)4/DA system is highly active for arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation. It can catalyze the hydrogenation of various substituted arenes, with a rate order of benzene > toluene > p-xylene > naphthalene.

C-H bond activation: The system promotes rapid C-H/C-D exchange in alkanes, with turnover frequencies comparable to or exceeding those of conventional group 9 heterogeneous alkane activation catalysts.

Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves electrophilic four-center activation processes. For alkane activation, it involves endothermic Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The system shows high activity for arene hydrogenation, with turnover frequencies up to 25,000 h-1 for benzene. In alkane activation, it demonstrates substantial selectivity, favoring primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds, and less hindered over more hindered positions.

The roles of σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis are explicitly mentioned in the mechanism. Chain walking is not directly discussed but may be involved in the isomerization processes observed for cycloalkanes.

While the document provides detailed information on the alumina-supported thorium system, it does not offer comparative data for silica-supported zirconium hydrides, making a direct comparison impossible based solely on this text.

该文献没有直接比较硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物。但是，它提供了关于氧化铝负载钍系统的详细信息：

制备和结构：Th(η5-allyl)4被吸附在脱羟基γ-氧化铝(DA)上，产生配位不饱和的高活性催化剂。只有约8±1%的Th表面位点具有催化意义。

催化性能：Th(η5-allyl)4/DA系统对芳烃氢化和烷烃C-H活化具有高活性。它可以催化各种取代芳烃的氢化，反应速率顺序为苯 > 甲苯 > 对二甲苯 > 萘。

C-H键活化：该系统促进烷烃的快速C-H/C-D交换，其转化频率可与或超过传统的第9族异相烷烃活化催化剂相媲美。

机理：提出的机理涉及亲电的四中心活化过程。对于烷烃活化，它涉及吸热的Th-C键形成和通过四中心、异裂σ-键复分解途径的HD消除。

反应速率和选择性：该系统表现出对芳烃氢化的高活性，苯的转化频率高达25,000 h-1。在烷烃活化中，它表现出显著的选择性，倾向于伯 > 仲 > 叔C-H键，以及空间位阻较小的位置优于位阻较大的位置。

σ-键复分解和氢解作用在机理中被明确提及。虽然链行走未被直接讨论，但可能涉及在观察到的环烷烃异构化过程中。

虽然文档提供了关于氧化铝负载钍系统的详细信息，但没有提供硅胶负载锆氢化物的比较数据，因此仅基于这篇文本无法进行直接比较。
