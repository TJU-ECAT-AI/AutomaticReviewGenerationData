Abstract 
The adsorption of organoactinide complexes on dehydroxylated alumina (DA ) yields coor- 
dinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for several demanding chemical transformations. 
Thus, in the case of Th(qs-allyl), 
supported on dehydroxylated 
y-alumina (DA), facile arene 
hydrogenation and alkane activation processes can be effected in slurry reactions at 90C and 
PHI 
= 30-180 psi. Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of z 25000 h-  per active site 
and cyclohexane C-H exchange with Dz at GZ 
1300 h-r per active site. Active site characterization 
using DzO poisoning, hydrogenolysis, and CH&l dosing indicates d 8 f 1% 
of the Th surface sites 
are catalytically significant. EPR and XPS spectroscopy provide no evidence for Th oxidation 
states less than +4. The mechanisms for the above processes are discussed in terms of electro- 
philic four-center activation processes in which the active sites appear to bear sterically signif- 
icant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation.

Introduction 
The chemisorption of well-defined molecular organometallic precursors 
onto metal oxide surfaces can afford new types of catalytic centers. In a number 
of cases, adsorption of precursors is accompanied by a profound enhancement 
in catalytic activity for such interesting and important chemical transforma- 
tions as olefm polymerization, hydrogenation, and metathesis [l-5]. 
The un- 
derstanding of the unique surface coordination environments that give rise to 
such reactivity enhancements and the tailoring of these sites for more 
chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective catalysis is of fundamental scientific and 
technological importance.

tory were 
organoactinide 
molecules [ 61. Their chemistry 
differs 
distinctively 
from 
that of typical 
middle-late 
transition 
metal 
organometallics 
in a number 
of ways, 
including 
the pronounced 
stability 
of certain 
highly 
preferred 
oxida- 
tion states. 
Thus, a key reaction pathway 
that is ubiquitous 
in middle-late 
transition 
metal 
chemistry 
and homogeneous 
catalysis, 
i.e., 
coupled 
two-elec- 
tron oxidative 
addition-reductive 
elimination 
sequences, 
is energetically 
un- 
feasible. 
For 
example, 
4 
+ is 
virtually 
the only known 
oxidation 
state 
for thor- 
ium (oxidation is impossible, reduction is exceedingly difficult) [ 71. 
Furthermore, 
the solution phase chemistry, 
spectroscopy, 
and thermochem- 
istry 
of organoactinides 
is reaching 
an instructive 
level 
of development. 
In earlier catalytic studies, we reported that compounds of the type 
CpkTh 
( 
CHB)JDA and Cp Th ( 
CHzCGHs)JDA (Cp = $-Me&&; DA = de- 
hydroxylated 
y-alumina) 
are highly 
active 
catalysts 
for ethylene 
polymeriza- 
tion and, 
per active 
site, 
rival 
the activities 
of the most active 
platinum 
metal 
heterogeneous 
catalysts (e.g., Rh-Si02) for the hydrogenation 
of simple 
ole- 
fins [4c,d]. The order of activity found for the latter transformation is 
CpTh(CH,CBH5)3/DA> CpiTh(CH3),/DA> Cp,Th(CH,)/DA, 
suggesting 
the 
importance 
of precursor 
coordinative 
unsaturation 
in influencing 
ultimate 
adsorbate 
catalytic 
activity. 
From 13C 
CPMAS NMR experiments 
[5a,8] on 
CpkTh(13CH3)JDA and Cp,*Th( 
3CH3)2/MgC12, 
it can be concluded that 
chemisorption 
involves 
methide 
anion transfer 
from the actinide 
center 
to a 
Lewis 
acid 
site 
on the surface [ 
91 (eqn. 1). Cationic 
hydrocarbyl 
species 
such 
as 
A are expected to be highly 
electrophilic 
and 
kinetically 
competent 
for 
olefin 
polymerization 
and 
hydrogenation. 
The recent 
synthesis 
and 
characterization 
of solution 
phase 
representations 
of A has 
further 
strengthened 
these 
propos- 
als [ 10,111.

From 
the above 
observations, 
several 
important 
issues 
are 
raised. 
First, 
it 
would be of great 
interest 
to investigate 
whether 
supported 
organoactinides 
are 
active 
for more demanding 
catalytic 
transformations. 
Second, 
it would 
be 
of interest 
to evaluate 
the properties 
of supported.organoactinide 
catalysts 
in 
which the coordinative unsaturation 
of the precursor metal center was in- 
creased. 
Third, it would be of significance 
to categorize 
the number(s) and 
local 
structure 
(a) of the 
active 
species 
responsible 
for 
the 
bulk 
of the catalysis. 
The present contribution reviews recent progress in these directions at 
Northwestern.

We begin our 
discussion 
with 
the properties 
of such 
precursors 
in a more 
demanding 
catalytic 
transformation, 
the hydrogenation 
of arenes. 
Hydrogenation of arenem 
by supported organoactinides 
Arene hydrogenation 
is considered 
to be a particularly 
demanding 
cata- 
lytic 
transformation 
in homogeneous 
solution [ 12-161 and 
the mechanism 
in 
several 
cases has been argued 
to involve oxidative addition-reductive 
elimi- 
nation sequences 
at a single atom site. For typical heterogeneous 
platinum 
metal 
catalysts, 
the mechanism 
is likely 
to involve 
alternation 
between 
metal 
oxidation states and multiple 
metal surface 
sites [ 17,181. 
For supported 
or- 
ganothorium 
complexes, 
only the 4+ oxidation state is available, 
and it will 
be seen 
that 
Th ($-allyl),/DA rivals 
the most active 
platinum 
metal 
catalysts 
in arene 
hydrogenation 
activity. 
Support and mechanimz of adsorption 
The support used in this study was a highly dehydroxylated 
y-alumina 
(DA, y-Al2O3, 
dehydroxylated 
at 
925 
o 
C 
under 
He flow; 160 
m2/g). The surface 
is principally 
composed 
of = 5.5 02- (strong 
Lewis 
base), m 5.6 exposed 
AP+ 
(strong 
Lewis 
acid), and mO.12 
residual 
OH (weak 
Brensted 
acid) function- 
alities 
per square 
nanometer [2,4,9,19

The organothorium 
catalyst 
precur- 
sors CpTh(CH,C,H,),/DA 
(l), 
Th[CH2(3,5-Me2)CBH3]JDA (2), and 
Th ($-allyl).JDA (3) were 
adsorbed 
from 
pentane 
solution 
on DA under 
rig- 
orously anhydrous-anaerobic 
conditions at coverages of (0.08-0.15) mole- 
cules/nm2) [ 20 
1. As already 
shown 
for Cp; 
ThMe,/DA, the 
adsorption 
process 
involves 
transfer 
of a hydrocarbyl 
anion from the organometallic 
complex to 
the Lewis acid site at the surface (eqn. 1) 
. We propose (vide i&a) that for 
Th ($-C&H,),, adsorption 
proceeds 
via a similar 
pathway (e.g., 
eqn. (2) ). 
In a similar 
manner, 
CPT(CHCH) 
( 1) is known 
to transfer 
one benzyl 
anion upon adsorption [8a], and Th [CH, (3,5-Me2)C,H,], (2) presumably 
transfers 
one mesityl 
anion. 
Catalytic hydrogenation activity of supported orgamactinides 
As previously 
reported [ 4 
1, 1 
/DA is very 
active 
for the polymerization 
of 
ethylene 
and 
the 
hydrogenation 
of propylene. 
The latter 
reaction 
rate 
at - 63 
o 
C 
is near 
the limit 
which 
is accurately 
measurable 
in a simple 
plug-flow 
reactor. 
Catalyst 
1 
/DA is not active 
for 
propylene 
polymerization. 
Survey 
experiments 
showed 
that while 
the catalytic 
properties 
of 2-DA are 
similar 
to those of l/ 
26 
MS. Eisen and T.J. Marks /J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 23-50 
DA, 3/DA behaves 
rather 
differently. 
Thus, 3/DA catalyzes 
the rapid 
poly- 
merization 
of propene at room temperature 
to yield atactic (by 13C-NMR) 
polypropylene, 
catalyzes 
the rapid hydrogenation 
of propene in a plug-flow 
reactor (Nt> 25 8-l at 25C), and catalyzes 
the rapid 
hydrogenation 
of steri- 
tally hindered 
olefins (e.g., cyclohexene, 
1,3cyclohexadiene) in slurry 
reac- 
tions at room temperature. 
We find Nt for cyclohexene 
hydrogenation 
by 3/ 
DA to be > 540000 
h- at 9OC, 
190 
psi H,. These latter 
two chemical 
trans- 
formations can be assessed 
to be sterically 
rather 
demanding 
from what is 
known 
about 
related 
homogeneous 
early 
transition 
metal [ 11,211 
and 
organo- 
f-element catalysts [ 10,22,23]. Kinetic studies 
of arene 
hydrogenation 
were 
carried 
out in rapidly 
stirred, 
non-mass 
transfer 
limited [ 22c,24] slurry 
reac- 
tions, monitoring 
the uptake 
of H2 (or Dz) by pressure 
decrease 
in a constant 
volume, 
pseudo-constant 
pressure 
reactor [ 221. 
The relative 
activities 
of the 
catalysts 
for benzene 
hydrogenation 
at 90C 190 
psi are 3/DA >> 
2/DA 3 l/ 
DA. Analysis 
of the 
reaction 
mixtures 
by GC-MS at 
different 
conversion 
stages 
shows 
that partially 
hydrogenated 
products are present 
below out detection 
limit ( < 0.00001% 
of benzene 
or cyclohexane) . This behavior 
is 
different 
from 
that of many conventional heterogeneous 
benzene hydrogenation 
catalysts 
where 
cyclohexene 
can 
be detected 
at partial 
conversions 
[ 171.

site 
where 
information 
is 
available. 
The benzene 
hydrogenation 
rate 
for 3/DA 
is far greater 
than those of the homogeneous 
catalysts 
and rivals 
those of the 
most active 
heterogeneous 
systems. 
In contrast 
to the above 
observations, 
cat- 
alytic 
hydrogenation 
experiments 
with 
solutions 
of 3 yielded 
only 
propene 
and 
negligible 
activity 
for homogeneous 
olefin or arene 
hydrogenation. 
Heterogeneous arene hydrogenation by Th(tp-ally&/DA 
scope 
Table 2 shows the wide variety 
of substituted 
arenes 
that can be hydro- 
genated by Th( $-allyl),/DA. 
The rate ordering follows the trend ben- 
zene 
> toluene 
>p-xylene > naphthalene. 
This general 
ordering 
is also 
found 
for conventional heterogeneous 
catalysts (vide infra) [15,16]. However, in 
contrast to the behavior of typical conventional heterogeneous 
catalysts 
for 
benzene, toluene, and p-xylene hydrogenation [ 
171, partially hydrogenated 
products 
are 
not detected 
in incompletely 
converted 
reaction 
mixtures 
for 3/ 
DA-catalyzed 
reductions. 
The product 
mix for the hydrogenation 
of naphtha- 
lene 
by 3/DA is typical 
of conventional 
heterogeneous 
catalysts [ 
171. 
Selectivity and regiochemistry 
As can be seen 
in Table 2, the hydrogenation 
of p-xylene 
by 3/DA yields 
a mixture 
of two regioisomers 
of 1,4dimethylcyclohexane (1:3 cistrans), in- 
dicating 
that all the hydrogen 
atoms are 
not delivered 
to the same 
face of the 
starting 
p-xylene. In conventional 
heterogeneous 
systems, 
deviation 
from all- 
ck H, delivery 
is usually 
correlated 
with the presence 
of unbound, 
partially 
reduced 
intermediates 
[ 171. Hydrogenation 
experiments 
on a 1:l benzene:p- 
xylene 
mixture 
with 3/DA reveal 
essentially 
complete (97:3) reduction 
of the 
benzene 
to cyclohexane 
before 
conversion 
of thep-xylene 
becomes 
significant. 
The regiochemistry 
and 
the relative 
amounts 
of the hydrogenation 
products 
of 
thep-xylene 
are 
identical 
to those 
obtained 
for 
hydrogenation 
of neatp-xylene. 
Experiments 
with 
benzene 
and 
Dz 
indicate 
by NMR and 
GC-MS that 
the 
only 
product 
obtained 
is the CeHGDG 
isomer. 
No evidence 
of partially 
reduced 
spe- 
cies nor of C-H/C-D exchange 
in the unreacted 
benzene is observed. 
Inter- 
estingly, 
however, 
C-H exchange 
with 
D2 
is observed 
over 
long 
periods 
of time 
in the cyclohexane 
products (vide infra). 
In 
regard 
to the 
regiochemistry 
of Hz 
addition 
to benzene, 
13C 
and 13C{ 
H} 
NMR spectra of the product C,H,D, indicate 
that each ( 
>95%) carbon is 
attached 
to a single 
H and a single 
D atom (Fig. la), and that more 
than one 
regioisomer 
is present (Fig. lb). The latter 
data are most simply 
interpreted 
in terms of two regioisomers 
in the ratio of lJk2.9. Further 
analysis 
of the 
partially 
deuterated 
cyclohexane 
regioisomers 
can be achieved 
by low 
temper- 
ature H(D) experiments, 
supplemented 
by the computation of theoretical 
spectra. 
The 500

( - 1OOC)

D2) = 3.5 ? 0.3. Studies of the kinetics of benzene hydro- 
genation as a function of temperature result in a well-behaved Arrhenius plot 
(Fig. 6). Least-squares analysis yields E,= 16.0 + 0.3 kcal/mol. A similar ki- 
netic study was conducted for p-xylene reduction, and as can be seen in Fig. 7, 
the reaction is again zero-order in substrate over a wide range of concentrations. 
For supported Cp;l 
Th ( 
CH3)JDA and its congeners, the surface and olefin 
catalytic chemistry can be described by Scheme 2, and all transformations 
have firm precedent in homogeneous organothorium chemistry [ 4,10,20]. Pro-

Neither the olefin insertion (step 1) nor the hydrogenolysis (step 2) is oper-

involved in Th (Iv) -centered olefm hydrogenation catalysis, the steps required 
for the hydrogenation of arenes have less precedent. We make two chemically 
reasonable assumptions before proposing a mechanistic scenario. (i) Th re- 
mains in the + 4 oxidation state at all times [ 7

This is also a reasonable assumption since the Th loading is very low and only 
a small percentage of sites are active (vide infra) [ 201. Neither multimetallic

have precedent in organothorium chemistry.

Such additions are usually exothermic for f-element complexes (in contrast to 
many middle and late transition metal complexes [ 
291). Moreover, in the pres- 
ent case, the coordinatively unsaturated insertion product should be stabilized 
by polyhaptc pentadienyl ligation-an 
amply precedented coordination mode 
for f- and early-transition elements [30,31]. Hydrogenation (step 3) would 
yield a butadiene complex, for which there is some precedent in organothorium 
chemistry [32]. Since this is a Th(IV) 
butadiene complex, rapid insertion 
(step 4) to yield a precedented -allyl 
does not seem unreasonable. In regard 
to regiochemistry, the metal-centered character of f-element hydrocarbyl hy-

argues that hydrogen delivery would be to the same side of the carbocyclic ring 
as the coordinated Th ion. The steps from the q3-ally1 
to hydride and cycloal- 
kane in Scheme 3 have precedent in that Cpi Ln ($-allyl) complexes undergo 
rapid hydrogenolysis to yield alkanes and the corresponding (CpLLnH)2 de- 
rivatives [ 221. Furthermore, steps 6 and 7 are well-known reaction patterns in 
organothorium chemistry [ 
23,29c,33]. In support of the overall steps 4-7 se- 
quence, Cpg 
Th (butadiene) has been shown to undergo rapid hydrogenation to 
yield ( CpiThH2)2 and butane [ 32b]. Thus, many of the structures and trans- 
formations in Scheme 3 have firm precedent or close analogues. 
Since the hydrogenation rate law for benzene is zero-order in arene and 
first-order in PHp, 
with a KIE of 3.5 + 0.3, these results introduce significant 
constraints regarding probable sequences of events in Scheme 3. Initial arene 
binding must be rapid and essentially irreversible. Whether the arene activa- 
tion follows the formation of an intermediate x complex (actinide $-arene 
complexes are known [34] ) followed by insertion (eqns. (7) and (8) )

cannot be rigorously determined with the data at hand. In the former scenario, 
the zero-order kinetics require o1 
B o_ 1 (If1 is large). The first-order kinetic 
behavior in Pn2 and the significant KIE argue in the simplest scenario for 
either: (i) a slow, possibly turnover-limiting step where a single Hz molecule 
is added, or (ii) a reversible H2 addition step followed by some other slow step. 
The observed kinetic order in PHZ 
argues that the slow step in (ii) cannot be a 
second H, addition (a PH2 
dependence greater than first-order would be ob- 
served) nor that a sequence of t+o or three coupled, rapidly reversible H, ad- 
ditions is involved, for the same reason. Furthermore, it is not obvious why 
rapid, reversible Hz addition should give rise to a kinetic HZ-D, effect of the 
observed magnitude. In the simplest scenario, the KIE can be most reasonably 
identified in (i) with steps 2 and 3 in Scheme 3. Note that typical KIE values 
for Cp;lTh( 0R)R 
hydrogenolysis 
(R=alkyl) 
are x 2.5 [33a], those for 
CpLTh (CH,),/DA-catalyzed 
olefin reduction, 1.5-2.0 [ 4b], and those for 
Cpi Th (OR) H olefin insertion, = 1.4 [ 251. Typical KIE values for Hz oxida- 
tive addition to da complexes are x 1.06-1.22 [ 351. The preceding discussion 
has of course ignored the possibility that one or more rapid, irreversible Hz 
addition steps to form $-Hz complexes [36] could come early in Scheme 3 
(e.g., preceding step 1). These would exhibit zero-order kinetics in P&, and 
the bound Hz could then be transferred to the carbocyclic substrate in a series 
of intramolecular steps, with some later addition of exogenous Hz being turn- 
over-limiting. This mechanism requires the formation of do, f $-HZ com- 
plexes, which have little precedent. Such species could not be detected in 
Cp6ThX,-Cpi UX, 
[33a] 
systems, and the only observation (Cpi Eut HZ 
) 
[ 371 indicates that binding is weak and labile. Furthermore, it is not clear why 
MS. Eisen and T.J. Marks /J. Mol. Catal. 86 (1994) 23-50 
39 
such 
binding 
would 
be favored 
over 
that of a more 
basic arene 
ligand, 
which 
is 
present in far higher 
concentration. 
In the absence of stronger 
evidence 
for 
Th ( 
$-Hz) complexes, 
this alternative 
seems 
best held in abeyance. 
The studies 
of benzene 
+ Dz and 
p-xylene 
+ Hz reduction 
regiochemistry 
indicate 
that H2-D2 
delivery 
is not to a single 
arene 
face. 
The most reasonable 
accommodation 
of these observations 
would 
be dissociation-reassociation 
of 
the 
partially 
hydrogenated 
arenes, 
possibly 
at 
the diene (after 
step 
3) or olefin 
(after step 5) stage. 
Since neither 
free dienes 
nor olefins are 
detected 
in par- 
tially 
converted 
reactions, 
the 
binding 
of these 
species 
must 
be relatively 
strong. 
In control experiments 
(vide supra) it was found 
that cyclohexene 
hydrogen- 
ation is far more rapid ( > 20 
x ) 
than that of benzene 
under 
the same 
condi- 
tions. Hence, 
the steady-state 
concentrations 
of partially 
hydrogenated 
inter- 
mediate 
species 
would 
reasonably 
be expected 
to be small. 
Alternatively, 
it is 
conceivable 
that the substrate 
fragment 
could remain 
in the Th coordination 
sphere 
during 
the permutation 
of bound face, possibly via agostic interac- 
tions to C-H groups (e.g., 
eqn. (10) ).

The experiments 
relating 
to the hydrogenation 
of the benzene-p-xylene 
mixture 
are 
also informative 
about 
processes 
at the active 
site. 
The initial 
cat- 
alytic 
turnover 
frequency 
is indistinguishable 
from 
that for neat 
benzene, 
and 
the kinetics 
are 
essentially 
zero-order (Fig. 8). At the point of complete 
ben- 
zene 
reduction, 
the cyclohexanedimethylcyclohexane 
ratio 
is 923. The kinet- 
ics for subsequent 
p-xylene hydrogenation 
are also essentially 
zero-order 
in 
substrate 
and 
the turnover 
frequency 
is also identical 
within 
experimental 
er- 
ror, 
to that 
of neat 
p-xylene (Table 2). Furthermore, 
the stereochemistry 
of 
p- 
xylene 
reduction 
is identical 
to that in neat substrate 
hydrogenation.

Selective alkane activation by Th($-allyl)+/DA 
C-H activation processes involving alkanes are also considered to be highly 
demanding transformations in homogeneous solution. Although significant 
advances have been made in the functionalization of C-H bonds by f-element- 
early transition element [38,39] and middle-late transition metal [38,40] 
complexes, the catalytic intermolecular activation of relatively inert alkane 
molecules with favorable rates and selectivities is still a major challenge. 
As noted above, studies of benzene reduction with Dz revealed C-H/C-D 
exchange in the cyclohexane product only after benzene conversion was com- 
plete. This observation prompted more detailed studies of hydrocarbon acti- 
vation. The results of slurry reaction studies of the C-H/C-D 
exchange for a 
variety of alkanes catalyzed by 3/DA (Thsubstrate = 1:lOOO)

over frequencies comparable to or exceeding those of conventional

dissociation energies [ 
421: primary > secondary > tertiary, and sterically less

as a 
function of conversion indicate single C-H exchanges, with no evidence for 
multiple exchange process (e.g., non-statistical 
amounts of RD2 species are 
below the detection limit) [43]. Interestingly, as shown by Table 3 entries 6 
and 7, isomerization of the cis-dimethylcyclohexanes 
to a &-tram 
mixture 
[ 441 occurs during the C-H/C-D exchange processes. Based on the same two 
reasonable assumptions as for the arene hydrogenation 
(vide supra), a plau- 
sible mechanistic scenario for the activation and isomerization of alkanes is 
summarized in Scheme 4. The mechanistic sequence invokes presumably en- 
dothermic 
[ 29a,b,45] Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four- 
center, heterolytic a-bond metathesis pathway (e.g. eqn. (13) ); E, Scheme 
4 [

skeletal isomerization would then occur via a /Y-H 
elimination

This process (6+6) would 
involve 
the rapid 
dissociation 
and 
readdition, 
although 
a 
concerted, 
bound 
olefin (e.g., 
by agostic interactions)

process 
is also conceivable. 
Also conceivable 
is a 
B 
H-shift from 
the tertiary 
carbon atom to the coordinatively 
unsaturated, 
electrophilic 
metal center to 
create 
a tertiary 
carbocation, rotation about the Th-C bond of the ring 
con- 
nection by 180, followed 
by a back H-shift from the metal 
to the tertiary 
carbocation center. This process seems less likely since typical carbocation 
rearrangement 
products are not detected 
for the various 
cyclic and linear 
al- 
kanes. 
Interestingly, 
the isotopic labelling 
experiments 
(Table 3) reveal 
little 
D incorporation 
at the dimethylcyclohexane 
tertiary 
carbon centers 
and neg- 
ligible 
differences 
in the D label 
distribution 
of the isomerized 
and 
unisomer- 
ixed 
hydrocarbons. 
These results 
also 
argue 
that 
the 
ancillary 
ligands 
L and 
L 
in Scheme 
4 are either 
non-D in identity (e.g., $-ally1 or oxide) or that such 
Th-D functionalities are chemically-stereochemically 
inequivalent 
to that 
formed 
in a 
B-H 
abstraction, 
since 
they 
do not compete 
for olefin addition. 
Active site 
characterization 
In the case of CphTh(CH,),/DA, CO poisoning studies in a plug-flow 
reactor 
previously 
indicated 
that < 4% of the surface 
Th sites 
are 
of catalytic 
significance 
in propene 
hydrogenation 
[ 4b,d]. This is not an unusual 
state 
of 
affairs for either conventional or molecular 
precursor-based 
heterogeneous 
catalysts 
[ 3a,4,5]. In 
the 
present 
study, 
several 
quantitative 
chemical [ 3a,4,5] 
probes were employed to determine 
the maximum 
percentage 
of the Th($- 
allyl),/DA sites 
which 
are 
catalytically 
significant 
in arene 
hydrogenation 
and 
to assess 
the chemical 
nature 
of these 
sites. 
A poisoning 
experiment 
was first 
carried 
out 
in 
which 
the 
3/DA catalyst 
was 
operated 
through 
part 
of a 
standard 
slurry 
benzene 
hydrogenation 
cycle. 
Nt was 
determined, 
and 
then a measured 
aliquot of degassed D20 in CBH6 
[47, 521 (D,O/Th=0.040) 
was injected 
through 
a 
high 
pressure 
port in 
the 
reactor 
head 
using 
a 
gas-tight 
high 
pressure 
syringe. 
Catalytic 
activity 
was then measured 
for 60 min (kinetics remained 
zero-order 
in substrate), 
and 
Nt 
was 
found 
to have 
dropped 
by 50%. This pro- 
cedure 
was 
then 
repeated 
with 
D,O/Th = 0.020, 
and 
Nt 
was 
found 
to have 
fallen 
an additional 25% (the kinetics remained 
zero-order 
in benzene). An addi- 
tional injection (D,O/Th = 0.010) further 
reduced 
Nt to 12.5% 
of the original 
value. 
From 
these 
results, 
it can 
be estimated 
that 
a maximum 
of 8 
+ 1% of the 
3/DA sites are of catalytic importance in benzene hydrogenation 
and that 
kinetically, 
these 
respond 
identically 
to DzO 
poisoning. 
This result 
and other 
assays 
which detect Th-H/Th-hydrocarbyl functionalities 
(vide infra) sug- 
gest 
that 
the D,O poisoning 
process 
involves 
protonolytic 
interception 
of Th- 
H or Th-hydrocarbyl bonds [ 471 (e.g.,

He, GC analysis 
of evolved organic components revealed 
exclusive 
propane 
formation ( < 1% propene). The propane/Th ratio was determined 
to be 
1022%. This result 
is in good agreement 
with the catalytic 
poisoning assay 
and 
is in accord 
with 
hydrogenolytic-hydrogenative 
formation 
of propane 
and

or 
variants 
in 
which 
greater 
than 
one ally1 
ligand 
is 
lost). Previous 
work [ 8a,c] 
showed 
that transferred 
surface 
Al-CH3 functionalities 
to be relatively 
inert 
to hydrogenation 
under 
these conditions [8a]. Control experiments 
indicate 
that S/DA is a very 
active 
catalyst 
for propene 
hydrogenation 
(Nt 
FZ 
25 s-l at 
25 
 C ) 
, so that any 
evolved 
propene 
should 
be largely 
hydrogenated 
before ex- 
iting 
the catalyst 
bed. 
A third experiment 
to assay 
surface 
Th-H was to flush 
a 3/DA catalyst 
in a plug-flow 
reactor 
with Hz (25 C), and to then dose 
the catalyst 
bed with 
measured 
amounts 
of CH&l (which 
is rapidly 
reduced 
by Th-H groups 
[ 
29c] ) 
. 
The evolved 
CH,-Th was found 
to be 8 
? 2%. Assuming 
quantitative 
halocar- 
bon reduction 
by available 
Th-H functionalities 
[ 201 
(e.g., 
eqn. (16) or var- 
iants involving 
greater 
then one hydride 
ligand), this assay 
of active 
hydride 
groups 
is in good accord with the coverage 
deduced 
from the D,O poisoning 
and hydrogenolysis 
experiments 
(vide supra )

poisoning of propylene

with Th-H ti- 
trations

Two types of spectroscopic 
experiments 
were 
also carried 
out to charac- 
terize 
the nature 
of the S/DA adsorbate 
species. 
Th (III) sites 
are 
likely 
to be 
EPR-active [ 71, and studies of active catalysts (recovered 
after a complete 
benzene 
hydrogenation 
cycle) were 
carried 
out in conjunction 
with quantita- 
tive spin 
counting 
procedures. 
It can 
be concluded 
that 
the quantity 
of detect- 
able Th(III) is less than lo-% of the 3/DA sites. Neither exposure 
of the 
solid 
catalyst 
to flowing 
Hz 
nor prolonged 
pumping 
under 
high 
vacuum 
signif- 
icantly 
altered 
this result. 
XPS studies 
of several 
3/DA samples 
prepared 
as 
above were also carried 
out in instrumentation 
equipped 
with an inert atmo- 
sphere 
entry 
port. Th 4f,,, and 4fsi2 
signals 
are only observed 
at 338 and 349 
eV, respectively, 
in the expected 
region 
for Th (IV), and 
clearly 
ruling 
out sig- 
nificant 
quantities 
of The [ 481. 
From 
previous 
surface 
spectroscopic 
and 
solution 
phase 
model 
compound 
studies, 
it is 
reasonable 
to assume 
that 
the 
Th ($-allyl), adsorption-activation 
process 
involves 
only one ally1 
anion transfer 
to a coordinatively 
unsaturated 
A1+3 
surface 
site, resulting 
in a cation-like 
organothorium 
center (e.g., eqns. 
(1) and (2) ). Since the hydrogenolysis 
and CH3C1 
probes assay 
Th-H sites, 
the simplest 
model 
of the active 
site 
would 
be a structure 
as H [

In 
principle, 
however, 
hydrogenation 
could 
remove 
a second 
or 
third 
ally1 
group 
per Th site, resulting 
in the less coordinatively 
saturated 
structures 
I and J. 
The hydride 
ligands 
in these structures 
would 
presumably 
be detected 
in the 
CH3C1 
Th-H assay 
and 
would 
also 
exchange 
with 
the 
tertiary 
hydrogen 
in the 
isomerization 
of 1,2dimethylcyclohexane 
(Scheme 
4). Furthermore, 
to be sto- 
ichiometrically 
compatible 
with the D,O poisoning results, 
this latter 
picture 
requires 
that Th-H deuterolysis 
be random and that species 
H-J, K, and L 
have 
indistinguishable 
catalytic 
activities/2\r, 
values. 
From 
what 
is 
known 
about 
ancillary 
l&and 
effects 
on Th-H reactivity 
[ 
25,29,49], 
this 
does 
not seem 
likely.

The preceding 
discussion 
has 
ignored 
the 
role 
of the 
alumina 
support 
other 
than alkyl anion abstraction 
in creating 
an organothorium 
cation, It is also 
conceivable 
that the metal oxide surface 
plays a role in either 
heterolytic 
Hz 
delivery (M) [50] or in arene 
activation (N). While there is some evidence 
that 
Cp,Th (OR)-R hydrogenolysis 
is accelerated 
by 
polar 
solvents, 
[ 251 
such 
effects 
are 
at present 
speculative 
for metal 
oxide-supported 
catalysts. 
Summary 
These results 
demonstrate 
that supported 
organ0 
f-element 
catalysts 
as 
embodied 
by Th ( f-allyl),/DA are 
competent 
for several 
demanding 
chemical 
transformations. 
While the active 
sites 
are 
likely 
to be electrophilic 
and coor- 
dinatively 
unsaturated, 
these data also suggest 
non-negligible 
ancillary 
liga- 
tion having 
steric 
and stereochemical 
consequences. 
Future 
research 
will 
con- 
tinue 
to explore 
the 
scope 
and 
mechanism 
of catalytic 
transformations 
possible 
only at unsaturated, 
supported 
organo-f-element 
centers, 
as well 
as the inves- 
tigation 
of homogeneous 
analogues.
