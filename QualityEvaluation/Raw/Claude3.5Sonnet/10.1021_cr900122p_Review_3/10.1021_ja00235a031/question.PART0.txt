Abstract: A new class of coordinatively unsaturated, monomeric organoscandium compounds, Cp*,Sc-R (Cp* = ($-CjMej); 
R = halide, hydride, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl), has been prepared. Cp*,Sc-CI is obtained from reaction of ScC13(THF), 
(THF = tetrahydrofuran) with LiCp*, and Cp*,Sc-R (R = CHj, C6H5, 
C6H4CH3, 
CH,C6H5) from treatment of CP*SC-CI 
with the appropriate organoalkali reagent. These organoscandium compounds react with dihydrogen rapidly to yield R-H 
and CP*SC-H. 
The tetrahydrofuran adducts Cp*,ScX(THF) (X = CI, H, CH3) 
are obtained upon treatment of Cp*,Sc-X 
with tetrahydrofuran. Rapid exchange of dihydrogen with the hydride ligands of CP*SC-H 
and CP*SCH(THF) 
occurs even 
at low temperatures. Other alkyl derivatives may be conveniently prepared by treatment of Cp*,Sc-H (or Cp*,ScH(THF)) 
with a-olefins, e.g., Cp*,ScCH,CH, from CP*SC-H 
and ethylene. Allene and Cp*,Sc-H afford Cp*,Sc(v3-C3H,). CP*SC-R 
(R = H, CH,, aryl) reacts with pyridine to yield Cp*,Sc(C, N-a2-CjH4N), 
which crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group 
Pna2, (a = 16.297 (4) A, b = 9.684 (3) A, c = 14.486 (6) A, V = 2286.3 (12) A), Z = 4). Least-squares refinement led 
to a goodness-of-fit of I .74 for 1128 reflections and a value for R 
of 0.0362 ( I  > 3u, 944 reflections). Spectroscopic and 
crystallographic data for Cp*,Sc-CH3 and Cp*,Sc-CH2CH3 indicate that the methyl ligand is bonded in a conventional (Le., 
undistorted) manner, while the ethyl ligand likely participates in a p C-H to Sc agostic interaction. Cp*,Sc-CH3 crystallizes 
in the orthorhombic space group P2,2,2, (a = 8.502 (2) A, b = 11.095 (4) A, c = 21.554 (7) A, V = 2033.2 (1 1) A3, 
Z = 
4). J-east-squares refinement led to a value for R of 0.072 (
F
:
 > 3u(F:), 
1143 reflections). H/D exchange between H,, 
arenes, and the primary and secondary C-H bonds of alkanes is catalyzed by Cp*,Sc-H and Cp*,ScH(THF). In benzene 
solution Cp*,Sc-H, Cp*,Sc-C6H5, and Hz 
are in equilibrium (AH = 6.7 (3) kcal.rnol-, ASo 
= 1.5 (1) eu), indicating that 
the bond dissociation energy of the Sc-H bond for Cp*,Sc-H is 1.5 (4) kcal.mol- higher than the bond dissociation energy 
of the Sc-C bond for Cp*,Sc-C6H5. Cp*,ScH(THF) 1s also in equilibrium with H,, Cp*,Sc-C6Hj, and THF in benzene 
solution (AH = 18.9 (8) kcal-mol-,, AS 
= 25 (2) eu). Cp*zSc-CH3 reacts with a range of hydrocarbons (R-H), activating 
their C-H bonds to afford methane and Cp*,Sc-R (R-H = I3CH4, 
arenes, styrenes, alkynes). The reaction of Cp*,Sc-CH3 
with styrenes is characterized by a moderate enthalpy of activation (AH* = 12 kcal.mo1-l) and a large negative entropy of 
activation (AS* 
-36 eu). A kinetic deuterium isotope effect ( k  / k   
= 2.8 (2)) is observed for the reaction of (Cp*-d,j),Sc-CH3 
with c6Y6 (Y = H,D) at 80 C. Very small differences in the rates of vinylic C-H bond activation for (p-C6H,X)CH=CH2 
(X = CF,, OCH,) and aryl C-H bonds of C6HjX (X = CF3, H, CH,, N(CH,),) as well as the positional nonselectivity for 
activation of the meta and para C-H bonds of toluene indicate that the scandium center does not interact substantially with 
the x system of these substrates in the transition states for these reactions. Thus, for these sterically encumbered organoscandium 
compounds, sp2-hybridized C-H bonds are activated without formation of a x complex; rather, the electrophilic scandium 
center directly attacks the C-H u bond. A general mechanism for these reactions with C-H and H-H bonds (Cp*,Sc-R 
+ R-H z 
Cp*,Sc-R + R-H), termed u bond metathesis, is proposed, which accounts for the systematic decrease in rate 
with decreasing s character of the reacting u bonds (R = R = H >
>
 R = alkyl, R = H >
>
 R = alkyl, R = sp C-H > R 
= alkyl, R = sp2 C-H > R = alkyl, R = sp3 C-H). Both alkyl exchange {Cp*,Sc-R + R-I 2 Cp*,Sc-R + R-I (R = 
CH3, 
R = I3CHj; 
R = CH2CH3, 
R = CH,)] and alkyl coupling (Cp*$c-R + R-X 2 Cp*,Sc-X + R-R (R = R = CH,, 
X = I; R = CH3, R = CH,C,H,, X = CI, Br)) are observed in the reactions of Cp*,Sc-R with alkyl halides. 
The activation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of saturated and 
unsaturated hydrocarbons is a conspicuous challenge that has been 
actively pursued in recent years., It is now generally recognized 
that there are two fundamentally different mechanisms for cleaving 
carbon-hydrogen bonds with transition-metal (or f-element) 
compounds: (i) oxidative addition to an extremely reactive 
electron-rich, coordinatively unsaturated metal center and (ii) 
-

(R,R = H, alkyl, alkenyl. aryl, alkynyl) 
heterolytic cleavage by a coordinatively unsaturated, electron- 
deficient and, hence, highly electrophilic metal center. The latter 
process typically utilizes do (or doP) metals and is usually pictured 
as involving a highly charged, four-center transition state with 
metal abstracting carbanion and the leaving group effecting proton 
abstraction (eq I ). This picture closely resembles that established 
by Halpern2c*3 
for heterolytic activation of dihydrogen in aqueous 
solution.

A curious feature of both types of C-H bond activating systems 
is that, despite their higher bond strengths, arene (sp2-hybridized) 
C-H bonds are more reactive than aliphatic (sp3-hybridized) C-H 
bonds. Initial formation of a 7r complex has been proposed to 
explain the greater reactivity of arenes for systems which oxi- 
datively add C-H bonds, and, indeed, Jones and Feher4 have 
developed a convincing case for an q2-arene adduct of [Cp*- 
(PMe3)Rh] (Cp* = $-CjMej) mediating the reaction leading to 
the aryl-hydride p r o d  c t .

character of the metal center for the latter type of C-H bond

activating systems, initial attack at the carbon p a  orbital (cf. 
electrophilic aromatic substitution) could be invoked to explain 
the higher reactivity of arene C-H bonds with CP*,SCR, 
Cp*,LnR(Ln = Y, lanthanide),' and Cp*,ThR2.* 
We report herein synthetic and structural studies of hydride 
and hydrocarbyl derivatives of permethylscandocene, together with 
investigations of their reactivities with H, and hydrocarbons. 
Experiments designed to probe the mechanisms of these processes 
have been carried out, and the possibility of involvement of the 
a system in electrophilic activation of aromatic and vinylic C-H 
bonds has been examined. A picture of the transition state for 
such "u-bond metathesis" reactions' is developed, which accounts 
for the relative reactivities of sp-, sp2-, and sp3-hybridized C-H 
bonds with Cp*,Sc-R (R = H, alkyl, aryl). 
Results and Discussion 
Synthesis of Alkyl, Allyl, Aryl, and Hydride Derivatives of 
Permethylscandocene. A useful starting material for the synthesis 
of a variety of derivatives of permethylscandocene is the chloride 
complex, Cp*,ScCl (1). Compound 1 
is obtained, together with 
its T H F  adduct (THF = tetrahydrofuran), when solvent is re- 
moved from a reaction mixture consisting of ScC13(THF), and 
2 equiv of LiCp*, which has been heated at reflux for 3 days in 
xylenes (eq 2). The coordinated THF is removed on sublimation 
of the residue under dynamic vacuum, affording pale yellow, 
crystalline 1 (eq 3). A solution molecular weight determination

shows only m/e values for ions derived from a monomer. By 
contrast, [(q5-C5H5),ScCIJ2 
is a robust dimer with the two chloride 
ligands bridging scandium centers.1 
Moreover, (v5- 
C5H5),ScC1(THF) does not dissociate its T H F  ligand on subli- 
mation.]' Both of these differences are undoubtedly attributable 
to the much greater steric bulk of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl 
ligand for 1. 
Cp*,ScCI readily undergoes straightforward12 metathetical 
reactions with main group organometallic compounds. Thus, 
Cp*2Sc(m-C6H4CH3) 
( m - 4 ,  
and Cp*,Sc(p-C6H4CH3) @-4) are 
obtained by treatment of 1 with the appropriate organolithium 
compound. The choice of solvent is sometimes critical (see Ex- 
perimental Section). THF is particularly deleterious, since none 
of the above transformations occur in the presence of as little as 
1 equiv of tetrahydrofuran; Cp*,ScCI(THF) is recovered from 
the reaction mixture. One alkyl derivative, Cp*2ScCH2C6H5 
(5), 
can be prepared, however, even in 1:l THF-toluene (eq 4).

These 14-electron hydrocarbyl derivatives of permethyl- 
scandocene have very crowded coordination spheres, as illustrated 
by their resistance to aggregation in solution and their poor af- 
finities for bases. Like 1, compounds 2,3, 
4, and 5 are monomeric 
in benzene solution. Neither trimethylphosphine nor tertiary 
amines form adducts with any of the above complexes. Moreover, 
while the phenyl, tolyl, and benzyl derivatives do not form de- 
tectable concentrations of THF adducts ('H NMR), Cp*,ScCH3 
(2) coordinates THF tightly enough to allow crystallization of 
analytically pure samples of Cp*2ScCH3(THF), 
even in the ab- 
sence of excess THF, illustrating the delicate balance betwen steric 
and electronic factors for these permethylscandocene complexes. 
The 'H NMR spectrum of 5 is consistent with an vl-(rather than 
v3-) 
coordination of benzyl to Sc: a simple A2B2C 
phenyl pattern 
is observed, even at -90 OC. While an v3-(allyl-like) structure 
cannot be excluded, these ' H  NMR data indicate an upper limit 
of ca. 10 kcalmol-I for dissociation of the C=C K bond, if, in

 these hydrocarbyl derivatives reacts rapidly with di- 
hydrogen to afford R H  and a single permethylscandocene com- 
pound, assigned the formula [Cp*,ScH], on the basis of the data 
given below (eq 5). This scandium hydride is rather unstable

under reduced dihydrogen pressures, decomposing in aliphatic 
hydrocarbon solvents to as yet unidentified products. When several 
atmospheres of dihydrogen are maintained over the solution, 
however, 6 is quite robust. After heating to 150 OC for over a 
week in benzene under 4 atm H2 
there is no sign of decomposition. 
Although the kinetics of these reactions have not been examined 
in detail, a half-life of ca. 5 min is observed for the reaction of 
Cp*&CH3 (2) with H2 
(2 atm) at -78 O
C
 in toluene (vide infra). 
The characterization of unstable [Cp*,ScH],, (6) 
is based on 
the following: (i) for R = CH2C6H5 
in reaction 5, 0.93 equiv of 
dihydrogen is consumed (Toepler pump analysis), and 1 .O equiv 
of CH3C6H5 
('H NMR) is formed; (ii) treatment with excess 
methyl iodide yields CP*SCI 
and CH,; (iii) when reaction 5 is 
carried out in the presence of at least 1 equiv of THF, a more 
stable THF adduct of 6 is obtained (eq 6). While CP*SCH- 
THF

(THF) does decompose slowly over a period of several days at 
room temperature, it appears to be indefinitely stable when stored 
in the dark at -10 "C. Solution molecular weight determinations 
for 7 show it to be monomeric. Like 6, 
Cp*,ScH(THF) reacts 
rapidly with CH31 to afford methane, and, in this case 
Cp*2ScI(THF). Infrared spectra reveal a rather low frequency 
for u(Sc-H) at 1390 cm-I, which shifts on deuteriation (vide infra) 
to 990 cm-I. 
Solutions of Cp*,ScH catalyze rapid H/D exchange between 
H2 
and D2 
(eq 7 ) .  Furthermore, the room temperature 'H NMR 
spectrum of a methylcyclohexane-d,, solution of Cp*,ScH under 
4 atm H2 
shows only a single resonance for the (q5-C5Me5) 
protons; 
resonances for ScH 
and H2 
are not discernible. Failure to observe

these signals could be due to broadening of the hydride resonance 
by the strong quadrupolar 45Sc 
nucleus (1 00% abundance, I = 
c Bond Metathesis for Hydrocarbons 
'I2, 
-0.22 barns) and/or rapid exchange of hydride with H2. Since 
quadrupolar broadening can often be alleviated by either raising 
or lowering temperatre,' 
variable temperature experiments were 
conducted. At 120 O
C
 a broad peak at 6 6.1 (full width at half 
height (fwhh) = 26 Hz) is observed. This new signal must be 
an average resonance for ScH and dissolved H2, 
since the signal 
for dihydrogen at 6 4.5 (methylcyclohexane-dI4) is not observed. 
This averaging process (eq 8) is very fast even at lower temper-

C
 a single resonance at 6 6.2 (fwhh = 32 Hz) is 
observed, whereas in tohene-d8 at -95 "c 
a similar resonance 
appears at 6 6.65 (fwhh = 33 Hz). From the estimated con- 
centrations of dihydrogen and [6] 
in toluene, the simple weighted 
average chemical shift of 6 7.3 (3) in t0h1ene-d 
(-95 "C) is 
alculated' 
for Cp*,ScH. 
Coordination of THF slows exchange of Sc-H with H2. Thus, 
in addition to resonances for (q5-CsMe5) 
and a- 
and P-hydrogens 
of coordinated T H F  (Table I), a toluene-d, solution of 
Cp*,ScH(THF) (7) under 4 atm H, at -90 "C exhibits a broad 
resonance at 6 4.8 (fwhh = 18 Hz), attributable to Sc-H, and 
a sharp signal due to dissolved H2 
at 6 4.5. Above ca. -20 "C 
these two signals collapse to a single broad resonance. Addition 
of I O  equiv of T H F  raises the coalescence temperature to 0 "C, 
suggesting that exchange between Cp*,ScH(THF) and H, is 
preceded by dissociation of THF from 7, Le., exchange occurs via 
Cp*,ScH (6). 
Although 6 is of only marginal stability, it is, nonetheless, a 
valuable synthetic reagent when generated in situ. Olefins readily 
insert into the scandium-hydride bond, affording alkyl complexes 
(eq 9). It is important that these reactions be carried out at -80 
"C to avoid other reactions (vida infra). With allene smooth 
conversion to Cp*,Sc(q3-C3HS) 
(10) occurs (eq 10). Variable

Alkyl derivatives of permethylscandocene are formally 14-electron 
compounds and, hence, are very electron deficient. In the absence 
of overriding steric interactions, Lewis bases bind strongly to 
scandium, by using one of the two low-lying, vacant orbitals (e.g., 
Cp*,ScCH3(THF) and Cp*,Sc(C, N-q2-C5H4N)).

The 'H NMR spectrum for Cp*,ScCH3 (2) (toluene-d8) shows

been unequivocally established,lsk insignificant 'H chemical shift 
and 'J?-" differences were found for the perprotio and p-mono- 
deuterio derivatives.16c With regard to the NMR data for 
Cp*,ScCH,CH, (9, 
a curiously large lJC(a)-H 
(1 
22 Hz) is found 
for the methylene group as was noted for the methylene group 
of (Me2PCH2CH2PMe2)C13TiCH2CH3.18C 
Indeed, if the structure 
of 8 does have the @ agostic interaction and hence a small Sc- 
C,-C, 
angle shown below, a larger C-H coupling constant 
(vis-a-vis Cp*,ScCH,), like that for cyclopropane ('JC_H 
= 161 
Hz) or cyclobutane ( ' J c -   
= 134 Hz), may be anticipated. The 
'Jc(+H of 117 HZ 
for Cp*,ScCH,CH,CH,, which does not exhibit 
low frequency u(C-H) bands, suggests that an abnormally large 
13Ca-H coupling constant may signal a P agostic structure.20 
Obviously, X-ray diffraction studies of the structures of 
CP*SCCH, 
and Cp*2ScCH2CH3 
could settle these questions. 
Single crystals of both 2 and 8 have been obtained, and the crystal 
structures of the two compounds have been determined. In spite 
of high-quality data, it was not possible to locate the hydrogen 
atoms of the -CH3 group for 2 or even the carbon atoms of the 
-CH2CH3 group for 8 with any precision: severe disorder in the 
($-CsMe5) rings in both compounds wiped out our resolution in 
the rest of the molecule as well. The X-ray results for 2 do provide 
some evidence that the CH3 
group does not have an agostic in- 
teraction with the scandium, however, since the methyl carbon 
is found in the plane defined by the scandium atom and the 
centroids of the two ($-C5Me5) ligands. An agostic interaction 
with one (or two, but not necessarily threelsd) C-H bond(s) would 
distort the carbon atom of this plane to one side. Since the methyl 
carbon is contained in this plane, within experimental error, we 
conclude that the Sc-CH, bonding is probably "conventional". 
It should be noted, however, a nearly symmetric18d,21 
distortion 
to decrease the Sc-C-H angles could also be consistent with these 
X-ray structural data. 
We are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the structure 
of Cp*,ScCH,CH, (8), 
however, because the ethyl group as well 
as ($-C5Me5) ligands are disordered. The two carbon atoms are 
poorly defined and do not refine well; at best we can say they 
appear equidistant from the scandium atom. Such a geometry 
is compatible with an agostic interaction of a P-C-H bond, but 
the X-ray evidence is certainly not definitive. 
The geometry of Cp*,ScCH3 (2) is normal. The Sc-CH, 
distance is 2.24 (1) 
and the average Sc-C(Cp*) distance is 2.46 
(1) A. 
Comparisons can be made with the structure of 
[Cp*2LuCH3]2, 
in which there are three Lu-CH, bond distances: 
one terminal at 2.344 (12) A and two for the bridging CH, group, 
2.440 (9) and 2.756 (9) A.22 The Sc-CH, bond length we observe 
is therefore reasonable by comparison to these Lu-CH, bond 
lengths, when differences in ionic radii (0.12 A) for Lu(II1) and 
Sc(II1) are considered. The cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms of 
2 are planar, within experimental error, with the methyl groups 
nearly in the same plane. The ring C-C distances range from 
1.284 (18) 
to 1.463 (15) A, with an average of 1.36 (6) A; the 
ring methyl-carbon distances range from 1.425 (24) to 1.601 (20) 
8
,
 
with an average of 1.50 ( 5 )  A. Because of large Uij's in the 
(q5-C5Me5) 
groups, these latter distances are highly imprecise. 
H/D Exchange Reactions Catalyzed by Cp*,ScH ( 6 )  and 
Cp*,ScH(THF) (7). Permethylscandocene hydride derivatives 
catalyze H/D exchange for a variety of C-H bonds. As with other 
catalysts,23 
H/D exchange is rapid for arenes. Exchange between 
Cp*,Sc-H and the aryl or methyl C-D bonds of toluene-d8 is slow 
at -80 'C, but at room temperature exchange between Cp*,Sc-D 
and C6H6 
is >95% complete within 5 min as shown in eq 13. The 
(20) Admittedly, these differences in C,-H coupling constant are rather 
small for the permethylscandocene series (Cp'zSc-R, R = CH, ( I  11 Hz), 
CH2CH3 
(122 Hz), CH,CH2CH3 (117 Hz)J, 
so that caution should be ex- 
ercised in extrapolating from these results. The lack of an agostic 6 C-H 
interaction with scandium for Cp*,ScCH2CHZCH3 
may be attributed to an 
unfavorable steric interaction of the C, methyl group with a pentamethyl- 
cyclopentadienyl group which is imposed upon 
coordination of a fl C-H bond.

The 'H NMR spectrum of Cp*,ScCH2CH3 (8) exhibits a 
simple first-order pattern for Sc-CH2CH3 with 3JH-H = 6.8 Hz. 
Interestingly, the I3C-H coupling constant for the methylene group 
is significantly larger than might be expected (vida infra) from 
the arguments presented above: lJC(a)-H 
= 122 Hz, whereas 
Since agostic structures are commonly fluxional, with terminal 
and bridging hydrogens undergoing rapid exchange (averaging 
chemical shifts and  J c -  ' s ) ,  
'H N M R  data for the perprotio 
derivatives are often inconclusive in differentiating agostic and 
conventional structures.'' Partial deuteriation of the suspected 
bridging position can produce significantly different 'H chemical 
shifts and 'JC_"s, as compared to the perprotio compounds; 
however, in some cases these effects have been found to be small 
for both (Y and (3 agostic structures.18C 
The 'H chemical shift 
difference between Cp*,ScCH, and Cp*,ScCH2D amounts to only 
0.057 ppm (cf., 0.047 ppm for Cp*,ScCH,(THF) 
vs. 
Cp*,ScCH,D(THF); 0.020 ppm for ($-C5H5)2W(CH3)2 
vs. 
(5-C5H5)2W(CH2D)2; 
0.010 ppm for CH, vs. CH,D). Although 
the difference between CP*SCCH, 
and Cp*,ScCH,D is the 
largest in the series, these data are, at best, inconclusive evidence 
for an (Y agostic structure for 2. Comparison of the NMR data 
for C*,SC'CH,'CH,D 
and C  * , S C '  C H , '  C H   
reveals a 
somewhat larger 'H chemical shift difference of 0.090 ppm (0.049 
vs. 0.139) for the methyl group upon monodeuteration, but the 
'JC(B)-H 
value of 120 Hz for C*,SC'CH,'CH,D 
is unchanged 
from that for C*,SC'CH,'CH,. 
Thus, these data must also 
be viewed as rather inconclusive as regards the structure of 8. 
'JC(,+H

Infrared data have also been used as diagnostic for agostic 
interactions, since the bridging hydrogen often exhibits a low 
frequency "u(C-H)"." 
No bands in the region 1600-2700 cm-' 
are observed in the infrared spectrum of Cp*,ScCH, (see Figure 
2). Moreover, Cp*,ScCD, exhibits two u(C-D) bands at 2195 
and 2152 cm-' (cf. u(C-D) = 2160, 2140 cm-' for CDJ). By 
contrast, three prominent, low frequency u(C-H) bands at 2593, 
2503, and 2440 cm-' are noted for Cp*,ScCH2CH3 (Figure 2). 
These infrared data for 8 strongly suggest a fi agostic structure. 
Thus, despite the inconclusive 'H NMR results, we presently favor 
an agostic structure for 8. It should be noted that, although a 
(3 agostic structure for (Me2PCH2CH2PMe,)C1,TiCH,CH, has 
u Bond Metathesis for Hydrocarbons 
complementary reaction, 6 + C6D6 + CH,I, yields Cp*,ScI, 
C6D5H, 
and CH3D (only). An upper limit of ca. 100 s is thus 
established for the half life of the exchange reaction at 25 "C ( k  
> ca. IO-, s-I.M-').

H/D exchange for CP*SCH(THF) 
(7) and benzene-d6 is much 
slower. 
After 1.5 h at 25 "C, treatment of a solution of 
Cp*,Sc-H(THF) in C6D6 
with excess CH31 
yields only CH4(<5% 
CH,D, k < ca. 
s-'.M-' at 25 "C). Onset of exchange occurs 
at elevated temperatures (>50 "C), but like exchange with H2 
(vida supra), dissociation of the THF ligand very likely precedes 
reaction of 7 with benzene. 
With toluene the progress of H / D  exchange was monitored by 
IH NMR spectroscopy. Multiple exchanges are achieved by 
treating toluene-d, with Cp*,Sc-H and H, (4 atm) in a sealed 
NMR tube (eq 
14). The positional preference (ortho, meta, para, 
[Cp*2Sc-H] 
H2 (4 atrn) 
toluene-d8 - 
toluene-d, 
(14) 
CH,) is of particular interest as regards the mechanism of ex- 
change (vida infra). After 2-3 turnovers the meta and para 
positions show roughly equal extents of proton incorporation, 
exchange into the ortho positions being much slower. An un- 
changing ratio (39:4 1 
:20) of integrations, 0rtho:meta:para ('H 
NMR, 500 MHz), is obtained after 48 h at 80 "C. Hydrogen 
incorporation into the methyl group occurs at a rate 60-70 times 
slower than for the aryl positions. On prolonged heating the 
amount of hydrogen in the methyl position gradually increases, 
eventually equilibrating at an aryhethyl ratio of 5.0:4.0 (slightly 
less than statistical incorporation of H in the aryl and hence slightly 
greater incorporation of D in the aryl positions relative to the 
methyl positions, as expected on the basis of the relative zero-point 
energy differences), The relative amounts of hydrogen incorpo- 
rated among the aryl positions does not change. 
A series of substrates was examined for H / D  exchange with 
Cp*,Sc-D by using 'H NMR spectroscopy. In order to effect 
extensive deuteration of the C-H positions of these substrates, 
Cp*,Sc-D and excess substrate were dissolved in benzene-d6 under 
4 atm of D,. The pool of deuterium in the solvent thus serves 
as the principal source for exchange, since reaction of Cp*,Sc-H 
with benzene-d6 and D, is considerably faster than H/D exchange 
with substrates (eq 15-17). Under these conditions 6 is thermally

quite stable. By using this standard procedure, intramolecular 
H/D exchange is observed for the methyl groups of the ($-C5Me5) 
ligands of 6 
(ca. 2 turnovers&' at 80 "C) and for the a-C-H 
positions of the T H F  ligand and the methyl positions of the 
(q5-C5Me5) 
ligands for 7 (h at 80 "C); the P-C-H positions of 
the THF ligand remain unreactive even after several days at this 
temperature. In 
light of the reactivity of Cp*,ScH with pyridine 
(eq 1 1 and 12), the a-C-H bonds of the T H F  almost certainly 
react reversibly and intramolecularly with the Sc-D bond of 7. 
Moreover, free and coordinated THF are in rapid equilibrium so 
that 7 acts as a catalyst for the selective a-deuteration of THF. 
Intermolecular H/D exchange is observed for the primary C-H 
bonds of a variety of molecules. In 
addition to the methyl group 
of toluene (vida supra), a moderate rate of H/D exchange is noted 
for CH4, 
Si(CH3)4, 
P(CH3)3,21 
and remarkably, at 80 "C for only 
the methyl groups of propane. Cp*,ScH(THF) (7) 
also catalyzes 
these H / D  exchange reactions; however, in all cases the rates are

much lower. Methane and tetramethylsilane exhibit similar rates 
of exchange, the predominant products at low conversions being 
CH3D 
and Si(CH,),(CH,D),-,,. 
Thus, incorporation of deuterium 
occurs in a one-at-a-time manner, in contrast to H/D exchange 
catalysts based on [PtC14]2-2S 
and zirconium a l k  x i d e s ,    
which 
have been reported to effect multiple deuterations per interaction 
with the catalyst. 
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange is also observed for 2
'
 
C-H 
bonds, but the rates are generally very slow compared with in- 
tramolecular exchange or intermolecular exchange with 1 " or aryl 
C-H bonds. For example, a rate of only 0.06 turnovers-h-I at 120 
"C is observed for yclopentane. 
The large difference in the 
rates of 1" vs. 2" C-H exchange suggests that this catalyst system 
may be used generally in the synthesis of aliphatic hydrocarbons 
with only primary deuteriation ( e g ,  
CD3(CH,),CD3) or aromatic 
hydrocarbons with only 1' 
and aryl deuteriation (e.g., 
CD3CH2C6D5). 
Moreover, the low rates of 2" C-H bond acti- 
vation may be used to advantage in providing inert solvents ( e g ,  
cyclohexane and cyclooctane) for the mechanistic studies described 
in the next sections. The C-H bonds of cyclopropane are ex- 
ceptionally reactive and are readily exchanged under the standard 
reaction conditions described above, at a rate comparable to 
methane and tetramethylsilane; no ring opening is apparent under 
these conditions. 
The qualitative scale of reactivity toward H/D exchange shown 
below clearly indicates that sterics (and s character of the C-H 
bond, vida infra) correlate more closely with reactivity than does 
the C-H bond dissociation energy of the substrate: decreasing

Thermochemistry of Equilibration of Cp*,Sc-H, 
C6fi6, 
CP*SC-CH, 
and H2. During the course of our studies of the 
H/D exchange reactions between Cp*,ScH (6) 
and benzene-d,, 
we discovered that 6 
reacts in a cleanly reversible manner with 
benzene to afford Cp*,ScC6H5 (3) and dihydrogen (eq 18). Thus,

if isolation of Cp*,ScH, prepared in benzene solution (for example, 
by hydrogenation of Cp*,ScCH3), is attempted by removing the 
benzene in vacuo, the product obtained is largely Cp*,ScC6H5, 
together with minor amounts of 6. Dissolution of this product 
mixture in benzene, followed by admission of 1 atm of H,, drives 
the equilibrium almost completely back to 6 ('H NMR). 
Measureable concentrations of both 3 and 6 
in benzene solution 
are obtained by dissolving 6 in benzene in a sealed NMR tube. 
The determination of the concentration of dihydrogen in solution 
using 'H NMR spectroscopy is, of course, not possible, since 
exchange with the hydride ligand of 6 
is rapid, and the 45Sc 
quadrupolar broadening obscures the average signal. The con- 
centration of Hz 
may be calculated, however, by assuming the 
(24) The molecularity of the H/D exchange with PMe, has not been 
determined. Detectable concentrations of a PMe, adduct of 6 do not build 
up, even in the presence of several equivalents of phosphine (presumably due 
to unfavorable steric interactions with the bulky Cp' ligands); however, H/D 
exchange with the methyl groups of PMe, is faster than with the methyl 
groups of the ($-C,Me,) ligands of 6 and faster than exchange with the 1' 
C-H positions of hydrocarbons.

number of molar equivalents of dihydrogen is precisely equal to 
the molar equivalents of Cp*,ScC,H, (eq 18) and that Henry's 
Law is followed (see Experimental Section). The consistent values 
of Kq 
obtained, when samples are cycled back and forth in tem- 
perature between 6 and 80 "C, give us confidence in this procedure 
(see Table 11). A van't Hoff plot of these data (Figure 4A) reveals 
AH" = 6.7 ( 3 )  kcalmol-' and AS" = -1 (1) eu. 
The small value of ASo 
for equilibrium 18, although not entirely 
expected for an equilibrium involving reagents both in solution 
and in the gas phase, supports the assumptions of othersz8 
that 
the free energy change accompanying an equilibrium is a good 
approximation of the enthalpy change and thus useful in estimating 
relative bond dissociation energies (BDEs). For equilibrium 18, 
the relative Sc-H and Sc-C,H, BDEs may be estimated from 
the C-H bond strength for benzene (1 10.9 k  a b m o l - ' )    
and the

Thermal Decomposition of Cp*,ScCH,. Heating Cp*,ScCH3 
(2) in cyclohexane at 80 OC for several days produces CH4 
and 
a pale yellow, crystalline compound which has defied complete 
characterization. Its solubility in aliphatic hydrocarbons is very 
low, precluding an accurate molecular weight determination; 
however, the low solubility does suggest an oligomeric structure. 
The 'H NMR spectrum (benzene-d,) exhibits four singlets at 6

reflect two parallel processes: a second-order step for the direct 
reaction of 2 with benzene-d, and a first-order (vida infra) one 
for the decomposition of 2 to the monomeric precursor to 12. The 
mechanism for the former is discussed in the following section. 
With regard to the latter, examination of the kinetics for the 
decomposition of 2 to 12 in an inert solvent (e.g., cyclohexane) 
under a variety of conditions revealed the following complications: 
(i) whereas different starting concentrations of 2 in cyclohexane-dI2 
produce similar initial rates of decomposition (k 
i= 6 (1) X lo-, 
s

)
,
 
nonlinear, autocatalytic behavior is observed, with the final 
rate of decomposition typically quadrupling the initial rate; (ii) 
rate acceleration accompanies precipitation of microcrystalline 
12; (iii) addition of small amounts of nearly insoluble 12 produces 
a greater initial rate of decomposition of 2, but nonlinear first-order 
plots are still obtained; (iv) Toepler pump measurements after 
complete conversion of 2 to 12 indicate only 0.80 equiv of methane 
are evolved. In view of the unknown structure of 12 and the 
complications encountered in studying the mechanism(s) of its 
formation, the ($-C5Me5) ligands of 2 have been deuteriated (via 
treatment of Cp*,ScH with several portions of excess benzene-d6 
under D2 
at 125 "C, conversion to 1 with CHIC],, and treatment 
of l-dj0 with LiCH3) to minimize this side reaction in the 
mechanistic studies presented in the following section. Although 
(Cp*-dlS),ScCH3 
shows the same complex kinetic behavior in 
decomposing to CH3D 
and 12-d29, 
a moderate kinetic deuterium 
isotope effect ( k  / k   
= 1.6 (2)) for the initial rates of decom- 
position obtains. Moreover, 'H and 2H

The activation of the C-H bonds of methane with soluble metal 
complexes has been observed thus far only with [PtC1,I2- in 
D20/CH,COOD solution,3s with some electron-rich group 8

by some closely related compounds, Cp*,YCH3 and 
C*,LUCH,," 
and by some thoracyclobutane derivatives, 
Cp*,ThCH2XCH2 (X = CMe2,

slow, the second-order rate constant being 1 X lo-, s-'.M-' 
([I3CH4] 
= 0.5-1.5 M, [Z] = 0.06 M), approximately 50 times 
slower than reaction of CH4 with Cp*,LuCH3 and 250 times 
slower than reaction of CH, with CP*,YCH,. 
Ethylene is rapidly polymerized by alkyl and aryl derivatives 
of permethylsandocene; 
however, u bond metathesis rather 
than olefin insertion commonly occurs with substituted olefins. 
For example, Cp*,ScCH3 (2) reacts readily with p-methylstyrene 
in cylohexane-d, 
to afford US-C*SCCH=CHC,HCH

is based on the large coupling constant (3JHH 
= 20 Hz) for 
Cp*2ScCH=CHC6H,CH3. The rates of reaction with two para 
substituted styrenes (p-(CH30)C6H4CH=CH2 and p -  
(CF3)C6H4CH=CH2) 
were examined to establish the effect of 
electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on the rate 
of vinylic C-H bond metathesis with Cp*,Sc-CH3 (2). Con- 
venient rates at 40-70 "C are obtained, it the reaction is conducted 
with [2] i= 0.1 M in benzene-d, and 2-4 molar equiv of styrene. 
Good fits to second-order plots were obtained in both cases.4o 
Measurements over a ca. 40 "C range provide the second-order 
rate constants and activation parameters shown in Table IV. The 
difference in the rate between the electron-rich and electron-poor 
styrenes is insignificant, being barely outside the limits of un- 
certainty. The activation parameters are also revealing, partic- 
ularly the very large, negative entropies of activation observed. 
Thus, the reaction of Cp*,ScCH3 with the vinylic C-H bond of 
styrene is characterized as having a rather small enthalpy of

has commented on a competitive bimolecular and unimolecular nature of these 
reactions for = Y, Lu (ref 7a). With scandium, a set of parallel pathways 
analogous to the reaction of 2 with benzene (eq 24) appears likely.

These observations are significant in at least two regards: (i) unlike 
the permethylyttrocene and permethyllutetocene analogues, which 
undergo several insertions of propene$3 the permethylscandocene 
system described here terminates completely (by vinylic C-H bond 
metathesis) after one insertion into the Sc-CH, bond and (ii) the 
u bond metathesis processes for reactions 28 and 29 appear to 
involve the much stronger vinylic C-H bonds in preference to the 
ca. 20 kcalmol-I weaker allylic C-H bonds. In order to ascertain 
whether the propenyl derivative, trans-Cp*,ScCH=CHMe 
(15), 
is indeed the kinetic product of reaction 29, Le., to exclude the 
possibility that the allyl complex 10 is initially generated but 
rearranges rapidly to more stable 15, C P *  S C (   - C  H  )  
(10) was 
subjected to the reaction conaitions for extended periods. No 
interconversion of 10 and 15 was found, thus confirming that 
vinylic C-H bond activation is kinetically preferred. 
While vinylic carbon-hydrogen bonds are more reactive than 
aryl C-H bonds, the much higher reactivity of the terminal C-H 
bonds of alkynes is striking. For example, Cp*,ScCH3 (2) reacts 
rapidly with propyne to afford methane and the propynyl complex 
Cp*,ScC=CCH3 
(16), even at low temperatures (eq 30). 
Compound 16 efficiently and selectively catalyzes the dimerization 
of propyne to the gem-enyne CH2=C(CH3)CzCCH3 (eq 31).

A likely mechanism, sequential u bond metathesis and alkyne

sertion of alkynes into scandium-carbon bonds is, indeed observed 
with internal acetylenes, e.g., for 2 and 2-butyne (eq 34).

(41) Other C-H

Rothwell, I. P. Polyhedron 1985, 4, 177. 
(42) When 2 is treated with only 1 or 2 equiv of propene, or if the reaction 
is carried out at 80 O
C
 even with excess propene, the reaction is not as 
straightforward as indicated by eq 29. In addition to the products listed in 
eq 29, isobutene and Cp*,ScCH2CH2CH3 
(9) are also observed. A reasonable 
explanation is that P-H elimination from the isobutyl complex may compete 
with u bond metathesis. Insertion of propene into the Sc-H bond of Cp*,ScH 
(generated by 0-H elimination) is, in fact, rapid (eq 9).

The preference for u bond metathesis over insertion for terminal 
acetylenes with Sc-R (R = H, alkyl) is further illustrated by the 
rapid reaction of CP*SCH 
with propyne to afford CP*SCCZ

hydrides rapidly insert propyne, yielding the trans propenyl de- 
rivative. 
Curiously, whereas trans-Cp*,ScCH=CHMe (15) 
is, indeed, stable, it is not formed, even after prolonged heating 
of the product mixture from reaction 35. 
As noted in the previous section, Cp*,ScCH, (2) reacts cleanly 
with benzene to yield C P *  S C C  H ,  
(3) (eq 24). The strongly 
electrophilic nature of the scandium center of 2, evidenced by its 
high affinity for Lewis bases, and the insertion reactions with 
ethylene, propene, and 2-butyne, which undoubtedly proceed by 
interaction of scandium with the a orbitals of these substrates, 
suggest that the enhanced reactivity of permethylscandocene 
derivatives with sp2- 
and sp-hybridized C-H bonds might well be 
attributable to initial attack of scandium at the P 
orbitals of these 
substrates. As suggested earlier6 by two of us (M.E.T. and J.E.B.), 
vinylic C-H bond activation could be viewed as arising from attack 
of scandium at the terminal carbon of substituted olefins to 
produce a zwitterionic intermediate or transition state, which 
collapses to product via abstraction of the proton a to the sub- 
stituted carbenium ion by the methyl "carbanion" (Scheme I).45 
The activation of aryl C-H bonds would then resemble electro- 
philic aromatic substitution (of [Cp*,Sc+] for H'), proceeding

of the terminal C-H bonds of alkynes with Cp*,ScCH3 is not as

obvious; however, the higher acidity of these sp-hybridized C-H 
bonds would once again be generally in accord with such hete- 
rolytic carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage mechanisms. 
Although attack of an electrophile at the highest occupied 
molecular orbital of an unsaturated substrate (Le., at the T or- 
bitals) is entirely plausible, interaction of the frontier orbitals of 
scandium46 
with the T orbitals of alkenes or arenes does impose 
very unfavorable steric interactions of the arene ring or the /3 
substituents of the alkene with the bulky ($-C5Mes) ligands in 
the intermediate (or transition state). Direct attack of scandium 
at the C-H u bond (perpendicular to the R system) is considerably 
less crowded as shown in Schemes I and 11. 
In 
order to experimentally probe these issues, the mechanism 
of reaction of (Cp*-d15)2ScCH3 
with (perprotio) arenes was more 
closely examined. As noted above, deuteriation of the penta- 
methylcyclopentadienyl ligands reduces the complications from

or other potentially reactive u

The positional preferences (ortho, meta, para as well as benzylic)

the kinetic ratios for the reactions of 2 and 5 with toluene, since 
authentic samples of 0-4 and p-4 do not isomerize on the time 
scale of these experiments (80 "C, <8 h, entry 4). The kinetic 
and thermodynamic ratios of the tolyl isomers appear to be the 
same (f3%), since prolonged heating of Cp*2SC(O-C6H&H3) 
eventually gives an unchanging ratio of tolyl isomers (entry 7), 
which is the same as the kinetic ratio, within experimental error. 
Significantly, Cp*&CH2C& 
( 5 )  is a kinetic product of the 
reaction of 2 with C6H,CH3 (eq 37); however, as shown by entry 
3, 5 eventually reacts further to afford the thermodynamically 
more stable mixture of tolyl isomers. Furthermore, the kinetic 
ratio of meta-toly1:para-tolyl products is nearly statistical (i.e., 
the rates of u bond metathesis for meta and para positions are 
roughly equal), whereas the ortho-tolyl product is formed more 
slowly and is thermodynamically less stable, presumably for steric 
reactions. 
The results of these experiments are clearly inconsistent with 
u bond metathesis mechanisms involving attack of scandium at 
the p T orbitals of olefins or arenes (Schemes I and 11). The 
following observations are particularly definitive in this regard: 
(i) hydrogen incorporation into toluene-d, and H, and Cp*,Sc-H 
(eq 14) proceeds at the same rate for para and meta positions 
(ortho being lower); (ii) there are no appreciable resonance effects 
on the second-order rate constants for reaction of Cp*,ScCH3 with 
the trans vinylic C-H bonds of p-XC6H,CH=CH2 (X = OCH3, 
CF3) (Table IV) indicative of a relatively nonpolar transition state 
for formation of the trans styrenyl complex, inconsistent with the 
zwitterionic one proposed in Scheme I; (iii) the rate of reaction 
of Cp*,ScCH, with substituted arenes is insensitive to the (7) 
donating or withdrawing character of the substituent (Table V), 
in contrast to very large rate differences commonly observed for 
electrophilic aromatic substitution; C6H,NMe2 and C6H,CF3 
214 
J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 109, No. 1 ,  I987 
differ by as much as 108-1010,47 
rarely less than 103-106;48 
and 
perhaps most convincing (iv) the (ortho-) para preference char- 
acteristic of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of toluene 
is not observed for a u bond metathesis between C6HjCH3 and 
Cp*,ScCH, (2) (Table VI). Large rate differences among various 
substituted benzenes are usually characteristic of electrophilic 
aromatic substitution; however, the absence of such effects may 
not be 
diagnostic, particularly for extremely reactive electrophile. 
A more definitive test for electrophilic attack is the positional 
selectivity of the substitution. For example, nitration of toluene 
proceeds with >95% ortho-para selectivity; the electrophile, 
[NO,'] attacks 6% 
at the two meta positions. All electrophiles, 
even very active ones, show a high ortho-para:meta preference.jO 
Moreover, electrophilic transition-metal complexes show the same 
strong preference; e.g., [Cp*Re(NO)(CO)]+ 
and [PtCIj]- attack 
toluene electrophilically with 2k,,,,/k,,,, 
= 32 and 18, respec- 
tively.51 Competitive attack at the benzylic C-H bonds of toluene 
is never observed. 
None of these characteristics of electrophilic aromatic sub- 
stitution are exhibited in the reaction of Cp*2ScCH3 
with toluene. 
Indeed, significant amounts of the benzyl tautomer 5 are observed 
early in the reaction, and significantly, 2kpara/kmeta 
= 1.0. 
Rate-determining homolysis of the Sc-CH, bond to produce free 
[Cp*,Sc'] and [CH,'] radicals appears inconsistent with the 
general reactivity patterns for Cp*,ScCH3 (2) with substrates: 
(i) cleavage of the strongest C-H bonds of substrates (e.g., H- 
CH=CHCH3, H-CzCCH,, 
in addition to H-C6H,CH3, etc.), 
(ii) pyrolysis of 2 in cyclohexane-d,, affords only CH4(<3% 
CH3D), 
and (iii) very large negative entropies of activation for 
the u bond metathesis between CP*S&H, and H-CH=CHPh 
(ca. -35 eu), indicative of an associative rate-limiting step. An 
estimate of the kinetic deuterium isotope effect can be made from 
the rate differences for (Cp*-dl5),ScCH3

Conclusions 
The hydride, alkyl, and aryl derivatives of permethylscandocene 
reported in the preceding section are extremely reactive toward 
a variety of u bonds. The general reaction (eq 42) illustrates the 
(R = H, alkyl, aryl; A-B = 
H-H, sp C-H, sp2 C-H, sp3 C-H, C-X, X-C; X = halide) 
broad scope of these u bond metathesis processes, several of which 
have been utilized as convenient syntheses for some of the de- 
rivatives reported herein. The mechanisms of these reactions are 
fundamental to an understanding of the reaction chemistry of other 
oxidatively inert, electron-deficient compounds, particularly do 
and many dof" systems. 
Our evidence relevant to the mechanisms of u bond metathesis 
with the permethylscandocene system points to a concerted, rather 
than stepwise, process. An appropriate model for the transition 
states of such u bond metathesis reactions must accommodate the 
observed order of reactivity of R-H bonds with Cp*,Sc-R' bonds 
(R = R' = H >
>
 R = H, R' = alkyl >
>
 R-H = sp C-H, R' = 
alkyl > R-H = sp2 C-H, R' = alkyl > R-H = sp3 
C-H, R' = 
alkyl). These rate differences are striking, e.g., CP*SC-H

Clearly, the rate decreases systematically with decrease in the s 
character of the reacting u 
bonds. The simplest possible picture, 
namely a four-center transition state, is indeed consistent with 
this feature.

The stability of the transition state should depend critically upon 
the s character of the valence orbitals of the atoms comprising 
the four centers: nondirectional orbitals provide better overlap, 
hence more bonding and more stability to the transition state. 
Steigerwald and Goddards2 
have carried out calculations on 
a model system, CI2Sc-H + H-H. Two of their findings are of 
particular interest in the present discussion: 
(i) The nodal 
properties of the scandium d orbitals are ideally suited to provide 
good overlap in the transition state with all three hydrogen atoms 
(4 centers, 4 electrons). Since the CI atoms (and by extension, 
the Cp* ligands for permethylscandocene derivatives) bond 
principally via the Sc 4s valence orbitals, the Sc-H bonding for 
C1,ScH is largely Sc(3d)-H( 1s) in character. Hence, the u 
bond 
metathesis, a formal 2s + 2s process, is orbitally allowed and 
energetically quite favorable due to the excellent bonding char- 
acteristics of the transition state. (ii) The optimal geometry for 
the transition state was found to be distinctly "kite-shaped'' rather 
than square, As a consequence, the H atom occupying the central 
(p) position relative to scandium bonds to both lateral hydrogen 
atoms but not to scandium.j3

(53) The d(Sc-H) distances are, in fact, identical (see ref 52); however, 
frontier orbital considerations reveal that no formal bond between the Sc and 
the P-H exists: the four electrons (one each from the three hydrogens and 
one from Sc) occupy the orbitals of la, and b, symmetry; the remaining 
orbital, of 2a, symmetry (that which is bonding with respect to Sc and the 
8-H) is thus empty.

Treatment of Cp*,ScCH2c6H, with benzene at 80  C  yields 
Cp*,ScC6H, (3) and toluene (no diphenylmethane and Cp*,ScH 
(6)), 
despite the fact that the latter (eq 49) is slightly favored by 
0.5 (5) kcal-mol-I. Thus, kinetic control (i.e., a transition state 
energy difference) does indeed appear to be governing the se- 
lectivities of these u bond metathesis  reaction.' 
Despite the 
apparent steric preference for the transition states for reactions 
47 and 49, the much poorer overlap provided by the sp3 
C orbital 
of R (vis-a-vis the s orbital of H) in the crucial center (p) 
position 
results in an overriding, unfavorable electronic effect.

developed and further elaborated by Rappe and U p t  n .    
Moreover, these authors point out that an electron-deficient metal 
center with one or more vacant orbitals would provide a low-energy 
means of approach for the H-H or C-H bond to the Sc-R bond, 
a distinct advantage in accessing the Steigerwald-Goddard 
transition state. 
The picture which emerges for the mechanisms of these con- 
certed, u 
bond metathesis reactions involving electron-deficient 
metallocene derivatives is thus (i) approach of the H-H or C-H 
bond to the vacant la, orbital of C  * , S C - R ,    
(ii) formation of 
the transition state described above (eq 43) with H occupying the 
central (p) position in all cases, and (iii) departure of the new 
H-H or C-H u bond from the opposite side of the la, orbital. 
The preference for H to occupy the central (
0
)
 
position in the 
transition state is easily reconciled by the model presented above. 
The bond angle to the lateral atoms is largest for this position in 
the transition state (the top of the kite), and, accordingly, the 
preference for s (nondirectional) orbital character is maximum. 
The resultant preference for [R] and [R] exchange between 
[Cp*,Sc] and [HI (eq 44) as opposed to coupling of [R] and [R] 
to afford Cp*,Sc-H and R-R (eq 45) can thus be attributed to

the relative energies of the transition states, Le., a strong kinetic

benzene, Cp*,Sc-C,H,, 
and H-H (eq 18) allows an estimate of 
the thermodynamics accompanying reactions 44 and 45 for R 
= alkyl and R = C6H,. Since the Cp*,Sc-H bond strength is 
1.5 (4) kcal-mol- stronger than the Cp*,Sc-C6H, bond strength 
(vide supra), the thermodynamics of the two processes can be 
approximated. For the reaction of Cp*,Sc-CH, with benzene, 
the two possible outcomes (eq 46 and 47) involve breaking the

The mechanism(s) for reaction of alkyl halides with alkyl de- 
rivatives of permethylscandocene are not yet understood. Radical 
pathways are likely alternatives to the concerted, four-center 
process outlined above, considering the prevalence of radical chain 
reactions between transition-metal complexes and alkyl halides., 
If the same concerted, four-center mechanism is, in fact, appli- 
cable, the two possible orientations of the C-X bond would appear 
to lead to comparable transition-state energies, since the alkyl 
exchange and alkyl-alkyl coupling reactions occur at approxi- 
mately the same rates. The lone electron pairs on the halogen 
4 
f 
A+ 
B* 
undoubtedly contribute to stability of both of these transition states, 
with the C-X moiety providing two orbitals and four electrons. 
Transition state A, with X occupying the central bridging position, 
thus bears dose similarity to commonly encountered halogen- 
bridged structures. Transition-state B*, 
although suffering from 
placement of the poorly bridging sp3-hybridized carbon in the 
central position, gains considerably in stability from the Sc-X 
interaction. The latter four-center, six-electron arrangement would 
thus compare with the transition states for activation of the C-H 
bonds a to an oxygen or nitrogen donor atom (e.g., the a C-H 
bonds of T H F  and the ortho C-H bonds of pyridine). 
c 
( A  
= 0 ,  
N: R = H, alkyl) 
The higher reactivity of sp2- 
and sp-hybridized C-H bonds is 
attributed to increased bonding (Le., lower transition-state energy) 
in the transition state for these reactions, summarized in eq 43. 
Implicit in this explanation is that the K systems of these substrates 
do not interact with the frontier orbitals of CP*SC-R 
along the 
reaction coordinate for u 
bond metathesis. The two bulky pen- 
tamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands likely block approach of the T 
orbitals for substituted olefins. Indeed, when the olefin is suf- 
ficiently small to allow interaction of its T system with Cp*,Sc-R, 
insertion, rather than u 
bond metathesis appears to occur, as in 
the polymerization of ethylene or the insertion of propene (eq 29). 
(56) Although alkyl-alkyl coupling of alkanes to higher alkanes and di- 
hydrogen is slightly endothermic, it is apparently very much disfavored ki- 
netically: no homogeneous system which effects this transformation has been 
reported to our knowledge. An equally conspicuous challenge is the (exo- 
thermic) reverse: cleavage of carbon-carbon single bonds with dihydrogen 
to afford lower molecular weight hydrocarbons.

The attack of Cp**Sc-R at the C-H bonds of arenes perpendicular

tally. Once again, sterics may be invoked to explain preferential 
attack of the Lewis acidic scandium center at the (lower energy 
and less extensive) C-H a orbital, since approach of the arene 
along this reaction coordinate places the arene ring in a much less 
crowded, nearly parallel orientation relative to the two ($-C5Me5) 
rings. 
Steric interactions of substrate substituents with the bulky 
(q5-C5Me5) 
ligands may also be invoked to explain the striking 
preference for primary C-H bonds in H / D  exchange reactions 
catalyzed by Cp*,ScH (vide supra). With primary C-H bonds 
the lone substituent may be placed in the equatorial plane of the 
bent sandwich [CP*SC], 
whereas with secondary or tertiary C-H 
bonds, one or two unfavorable steric interactions between (v5- 
C5Me5) 
ligands and alkyl substituent(s) necessarily accompany 
the transition states of these u bond metathesis reactions.

were performed by using standard Toepler techniques, and the gases were 
identified by mass spectrometry or NMR. Xylene was distilled from 
CaH, under dinitrogen. T H F  was purified by vacuum transfer from 
sodium benzophenone. All other solvents were dried over LiAIH4 and 
stored over titanocene.6' NMR solvents: benzene-d,, cyclohexane-d,,, 
toluene-d, (Stohler Inc.), and methylcyclohexane-d,, were dried over 
activated 4-A molecular sieves. Argon and hydrogen were purified by 
passage over MnO on vermiculite62 
and activated 4-A molecular sieves. 
N M R  spectra were recorded on Varian EM-390 (IH, 90 MHz), 
JEOL FX 90Q ('H, 89.56 MHz; "C, 22.50 MHz; 19F, 84.26 MHz), 
JEOL GX400Q ('H, 399.78 MHz; I3C, 100.38 MHz) and Bruker 
WM5OO ('H, 500.13 MHz) spectrometers. Infrared spectra were mea- 
sured as Nujol mulls on KBr plates and recorded on a Beckman IR-4240 
spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded by using Kratos MS25 and 
Dupont 4592 mass spectrometers. Analyses were performed by Bern- 
hardt Analytical Laboratories and by Larry Henling of the Caltech 
Analytical Laboratory. Molecular weights were determined by using the

A significant and interesting question concerns the polarity of 
the transition states for these u bond metathesis reactions. In 
view 
of the electropositive character of the metals which effect these 
transformations, a highly polar transition state has normally been 
invoked.58 On the other hand, the facility of these reactions is 
nonpolar media (e.g., aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) and 
the Mulliken populations obtained by Goddard and Steigerwald 
for Sc and the H atoms in the transition state52 
suggest a relatively 
nonpolar character. The insensitivity of the second-order rate 
constants for the reaction of Cp*,ScCH, with substituted arenes 
(eq 36) to the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating nature 
of the substituents might be taken to support the latter view; 
however, the effect of these substituents on the polarity of the 
ortho, meta, and para C-H bonds is only minimal. Indeed, an 
alternative explanation for the order of reactivity (sp-C-H > 
sp2-C-H > 
sp3-C-H) could invoke a highly polar transition state, 
since hydrocarbon acidity59 
does indeed follow precisely this same 
order.60 Since both explanations invoke higher reactivity with 
higher s character, a distinction between the two and, hence, a 
decision concerning the polarity of the transition states for 
bond 
metathesis must await further experiments. At present, we favor 
a relatively nonpolar concerted process with the electrophilic 
scandium attacking the reacting u bond in a relatively symmetric 
fashion. We admit, however, that our experimental results do 
not require this interpretation.

Reaction of Cp*,Sc(C,N-q2-C,H,N) with Pyridine-d,. An NMR tube 
containing 0.025 g of 11 (0.064 mmol) and 0.026 mL of pyridine-d, (0.32 
mmol, 5 equiv) dissolved in 0.35 mL of benzene-d6 was sealed with a 
torch. After 2 days at room temperature the pyridyl ligand had been 
converted to o-pyridine-d, ('H NMR), while the Cp* resonance remained 
unchanged. 
H / D  Exchange between Cp*,sc-D and C6H6 (eq 13). Compound 5 
(33 mg, 0.081 mmol) was dissolved in 0.3 mL of benzene-d6 and placed 
under 2 atm of D,. The solution was stirred for IO min and then cooled 
to -78 OC. Benzene-d, was sublimed from the reaction under reduced 
pressure as the solid was allowed to warm. The resulting solid was 
dissolved in 0.4 mL of C,H, and transferred to an N M R  tube. After 5 
min at room temperature the tube was cooled to -78 OC and charged 
with 0.098 mmol of CH,I. The tube was sealed and warmed to room 
temperature. The ' H  N M R  spectrum showed resonances assignable to 
Cp*,Scl and CH4; CH,D was not observed. 
A small amount of 
Cp*,ScC6H, (5% relative to Cp*,ScI) was observed. 
H / D  Exchange for Cyclopentane. A 5-mm N M R  tube was charged 
with 8 mg of 1 (0.024 mmol), 50 pL of cyclopentane (0.53 mmol), 0.35 
mL of benzene-d,, and 700 torr of H, (3.6 atm at 25 "C). The entire 
tube (open to the 700 torr H, source) was cooled to -196 OC and sealed 
with a torch. The tube was heated at 120 OC for 26 days, and the 
reaction solution was examined by GC/MS. Comparison with the mass 
spectrum of a cyclopentane standard indicated 17% monodeuteriation, 
corresponding to a turn over rate of ca. 0.06 turnovers/day. 
Equilibration of Cp*,ScH or Cp*,ScH(THF), C,H,, Cp*,ScC,H,, and 
H, (eq 18 and 19). The sample used in equilibrium studies between 
Cp*,ScH and Cp*,ScC,HS (eq 18) was prepared in an N M R  tube fused 
to a Kontes Teflon stoppered valve, which was fitted with a standard 
taper joint for attaching to a vacuum line. The tube was charged with 
18 mg of 2 (0.054 mmol) and 0.5 mL of C6H,. The entire N M R  tube 
was cooled to -196 OC. H, (700 torr) was introduced into the tube, and 
10 minutes was allowed for the gas to come to thermal equilibrium. The 
Kontes valve was closed, and the tube was warmed to 25 OC. The tube 
was removed from the vacuum line and shaken for 5 min to ensure 
formation of Cp*,ScH. The tube was connected to the vacuum line and 
cooled to -196 "C, the hydrogen was removed in vacuo, and the tube was 
sealed with a torch. 
To study the equilibration between Cp*,Sc(THF)H and C6H6 
(eq 19) 
a C6H6 
solution of an isolated sample of Cp*,Sc(THF)H was sealed in 
an N M R  tube. 
The experiments at 25 "C and higher temperatures were carried out 
in a constant temperature oil bath (fO.l "C), which was heated with a 
Precision Scientific Co. thermostated water circulator. The samples were 
fully submerged in the bath and agitated to facilitate the equilibration 
of H2 
between the solution and gas phases. The experiments carried out 
at 6 OC were performed in a cold room at this temperature.

The concentration of di-

Preparation of (Cp*-d,,),ScCH,. 
A 50-mL, thick-walled glass bomb 
with a fused Teflon needle valve was charged with 4 g of Cp*,ScCH, (2) 
(12 mmol), I O  mL of benzene-d, (>99.5% D), and 2 atm of D,. The 
bomb was heated at 80 "C for 1 day. The gas (H2, 
HD, D,, and CH3D) 
was removed, and 1 atm of D2 
was admitted. After heating at 115 "C 
for 24 h, the gas mixture and benzene were removed in vacuo, and 
benzene-d6 (20 mL) and D, (1 atm) were added. After heating an 
additional 24 h at 115 "C, the cycle was repeated one more time with 
fresh benzene-d6 (35 mL) and D2 
(1 atm). The bomb was cooled to -78 
OC, 12 mmol of CH,Cl, were condensed in, 1 atm of H2 
was added, and 
the mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature. After 5 
min, volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was recrystallized at 
-78 OC from diethyl ether/petroleum ether to afford 2.73 g (62%) of

The amount of proton impurity was 
determined ('H N M R  integration vs. ferrocene) to be <0.2%'. (Cp*-

as described previously. 
Kinetic Measurements of Intramolecular C-H and C-D Acthation. 
Compound 2 (25 mg, 0.076 mmol), 3 pL of cyclooctane, and 0.40 mL 
of cyclohexane-d,, were loaded into an N M R  tube, and the tube was 
sealed under 1 atm of N2. The sample was heated at 80 OC. The kinetics 
of intramolecular C-H activation were followed by 'H NMR, monitoring 
the decrease in integrated intensity of the Sc-CH, resonance relative to 
internal cyclooctane. The kinetics of intramolecular C-D activation were 
examined in the same manner substituting 2-d3, in place of 2. 
Kinetic Measurements for the Reaction of Cp*,ScCH, with I3CH, (eq 
26). Compound 2 ( I O  mg, 0.03 mmol), cyclohexane-d,, (0.5 mL), and 
0.6-5.0 mmmol of "CH, were sealed in 5-mm medium-walled NMR 
tubes (Wilmad Enc., 524-p). At 70 OC approximately 20% of the CH4 
was in solution; accurate ( f 5 8 )  concentrations were obtained with cy- 
clooctane as an internal integration standard. Plots of -In[Sc-CH,] 
vs. 
time were linear over 2-5 half-lives (depending on the ratio of 12C:13C 
in the system) with excess "CH,. 
Only data from the first 20-30% of 
the reaction was considered. In roughly 20% 
of these experiments kobsd 
was 3-4 times larger than expected. Repeating the experiment generally 
gave a value of kobsd consistent with those observed at other concentra- 
tions of methane. We attribute this rate increase to a small amount of 
some (unidentified) catalyst promoting the reaction. 
The reaction 
chemistry exhibited by the tucked-in complex 12 (vide supra) suggests 
that it may be the catalyst. This apparent catalysis was most common 
in aged samples of 2, for which some thermal decomposition could have 
given rise to a small amount of 12.

Reaction of Cp*,ScCH, with Propene. A sealed N M R  tube was 
prepared containing 20 mg of compound 2 (0.06 mmol), 0.4 mL of 
cyclohexane-d,,, and 0.64 mmol of propene. The reaction was monitored 
at room temperature by IH N M R  (90 MHz). The isolation of a pure 
sample of trans-Cp*,ScCH=CHCH3 was attempted by using the same 
procedure as for Cp*,ScCH=C(CH,), 
at 25 and 80 OC. In 
both cases 
only an impure oil (80-90%, IH NMR) was obtained [IR 2660, 1565, 
1530, 1250, 1150, 1020, 985, 795, 680, 660, 435 cm-I]. The N M R  
spectrum of trans-Cp*,ScCH=CHCH, is very similar to those report- 
edU for the analogous zirconium and hafnium complexes trans-Cp*,M- 
(CH=CHCH,), 
(M = Zr, Hf). 
Cp*,ScC=CCH, (16). Compound 2 (234 mg, 0.71 mmol) was dis- 
solved in 10 mL of petroleum ether, and the solution was cooled to -78 
'C. Propyne (0.78 mmol) was condensed into the solution from a gas 
bulb, and the reaction vessel was slowly warmed to room temperature.

Dimerization 
of Propyne. A sealed N M R  tube was prepared with 26 
mg of compound 2 (0.079 mmol), 0.4 mL of benzene-d,, and 0.55 mmol 
of propyne (7 equiv). Within 30 min at room temperature, all of the 
propyne had been consumed. 2-Methyl-l-penten-3-yne, 16, and methane 
were the only compounds observed in the N M R  spectrum. The 2- 
methyl-1-penten-3-yne was identified by comparison of its N M R  to that 
of an authentic sample. 
Kinetics of the Reactions of (Cp*-dI5),ScCH, 
with C,H,R (R = N- 
(CH,),, CH,, H, CF,). Sealed N M R  tubes containing 15 mg of (Cp*- 
dlS),ScCH, (0.041 mmol), 0.35 mL of cyclohexane-d,,, 0.52 mmol of the 
appropriate substituted benzene, and 2.5 pL of cyclooctane were heated 
at 80 f 
0.5 OC. The reaction was followed by IH NMR spectroscopy, 
monitoring the decrease in integrated intensity of the Sc-CH, resonance 
relative to cyclooctane. In all cases, the only new compounds observed 
were the aryl complexes, and the kinetics were pseudo first order for over 
3 half-lives. CH,D accounted for 5% or less of the total methanes 
produced. 
Structure Determination for (q5-CSMe,),Sc(C, 
N-q2-CSH4N). 
Single 
crystals, grown from a toluene solution at -80 OC over 2 days, were 
mounted in glass capillaries under N2. Oscillation and Weissenberg 
photographs indicated orthorhombic symmetry (a = 16.297 (4) A, 
b = 
9.684 (3) A, 
c = 14.486 (6) A, 
V = 2286.3 (12) 8,,, Z = 4). The crystals 
decomposed rapidly upon X-ray exposure. After 8-10 h the reflection 
intensities began to decrease, and after 24 h, no diffraction was observed. 
Intensity data were collected on a locally modified Syntex P2, diffrac- 
tometer with graphite monochromator and Mo K a  radiation at a fast 
scan speed (8.37.min-' in 28), and an entire quadrant (+h,+k,fl) to 
2 8  = 30' was collected in 8.5 h with 8-28 scans (A28 = 2.8' plus 
dispersion); no observable deterioration was indicated. Systematic ab- 
sences in the intensity data indicated space group Pna2, or Pnam: Pna2, 
was chosen. The intensities were reduced to FO2,

The coordinates of the scandium atom were derived from the Patterson 
map; a series of Fourier maps was used to determine the coordinates of 
the remaining non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atom positions were de- 
termined by assuming idealized geometry and by locating peaks in the 
difference map. 
The pyridyl ligand is disordered and results in the complete superpo- 
sition of two pyridyl groups of equal population. To model this, all atoms 
in the pyridyl group were given full populations, except for the two atoms 
bound to Sc, which were each modeled as 50% carbon and 50% nitrogen 
atom. Least-squares refinement of the coordinates of all non-hydrogen 
atoms with anisotropic Gaussian displacement parameters, ti,,?,

A Patterson map gave scan-

located the remaining atoms. Hydrogen atoms on the Cp* methyl groups 
were introduced, based on difference maps calculated in the planes where 
they were expected, and included in the subsequent calculations as con- 
stant contributions to the structure factors, with isotroplc B of 10.0

Six cycles of full matrix least squares, the hydrogen atoms being repo- 
sitioned two times, concluded the refinement; the final R = 0.1 13 for all 
the data with F: > 0 and 0.072 
for data with F: > 3u(F?). The 
goodness of fit was S = 2.98, 
where n = number of data = 2076

more than one-half its standard deviation. A final difference map showed 
no excursion greater than f0.44
