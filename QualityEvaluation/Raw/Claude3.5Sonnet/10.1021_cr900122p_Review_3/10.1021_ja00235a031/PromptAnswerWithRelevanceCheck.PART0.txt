Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document primarily discusses organoscandium compounds and their reactions, particularly focusing on permethylscandocene derivatives. It does not mention zirconium or thorium catalysts, or their supported forms on silica or alumina. The mechanisms, reaction rates, selectivity, and processes like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking for these specific catalysts are not discussed in this text. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or contrast of their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions based on the given information.

给定的文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。该文档主要讨论有机钪化合物及其反应，特别关注全甲基钪二茂衍生物。它没有提到锆或钍催化剂，或它们在硅胶或氧化铝上的负载形式。文中没有讨论这些特定催化剂的机理、反应速率、选择性以及σ键复分解、氢解和链行走等过程。因此，我无法根据给定信息提供它们在C-H键活化反应中的制备、结构和催化性能的比较或对比。

The given literature does not contain information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides for C-H bond activation reactions. The document primarily discusses scandium-based organometallic complexes and their reactivity in C-H bond activation. It does not mention zirconium or thorium hydrides supported on silica or alumina, nor does it discuss their mechanisms for H/D exchange or alkane metathesis. The document also does not provide information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking for these specific systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
