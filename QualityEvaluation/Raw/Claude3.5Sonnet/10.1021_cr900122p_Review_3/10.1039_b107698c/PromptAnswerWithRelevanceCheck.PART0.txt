Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document focuses on DFT calculations of CH4 activation by lanthanide complexes, particularly discussing reactions involving Cl2LnZ (Z = H, CH3) as models for Cp*2LnZ. It does not discuss the specific catalysts, mechanisms, or processes mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的任何信息。该文件主要关注镧系配合物对CH4活化的DFT计算,特别讨论了涉及Cl2LnZ(Z = H, CH3)作为Cp*2LnZ模型的反应。它没有讨论问题中提到的特定催化剂、机理或过程。因此,仅基于给定文献中提供的信息,无法充分回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. The document focuses on DFT calculations of CH4 activation by lanthanide complexes, particularly examining reactions involving Cl2LnZ (Z = H, CH3) models. It does not discuss the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of zirconium or thorium hydrides supported on silica or alumina. The mechanisms of H/D exchange and alkane metathesis for these specific catalysts are not addressed in this text. Similarly, there is no information provided about reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking for these particular systems.

The document does discuss σ-bond metathesis in the context of lanthanide complexes, but not for the specific zirconium and thorium hydride catalysts mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison or contrast of the requested information based on the given literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献并不包含任何关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。该文档主要集中在镧系配合物活化CH4的密度泛函理论(DFT)计算上,特别是研究涉及Cl2LnZ (Z = H, CH3)模型的反应。它没有讨论锆或钍氢化物在硅胶或氧化铝上负载的制备、结构或催化性质。文本中没有提到这些特定催化剂的H/D交换和烷烃复分解的机理。同样,对于这些特定系统的反应速率、选择性或氢解和链行走的作用也没有提供信息。

该文档确实在镧系配合物的背景下讨论了σ键复分解,但并不涉及问题中提到的特定锆和钍氢化物催化剂。因此,我无法根据给定的文献对所要求的信息进行有意义的比较或对比。
