[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"

[2] "which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions that early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes can participate in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures. These reactions typically proceed through σ-bond metathesis because the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot undergo oxidative addition.

The literature does not contain specific details about the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It also lacks information on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes. Without more comprehensive data, a detailed comparison of these two catalyst systems cannot be made based solely on the provided text.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文本仅简要提到早期d0过渡金属或镧系元素氢化物络合物可以在低温下与烷烃参与交换反应。这些反应通常通过σ-键复分解进行，因为金属络合物处于最高氧化态，原则上不能进行氧化加成。

文献中没有关于硅胶负载锆氢化物或氧化铝负载钍氢化物的制备、结构或催化性质的具体细节。它也缺乏有关反应速率、选择性以及氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的信息。没有更全面的数据，仅根据提供的文本无法对这两种催化剂系统进行详细比较。

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions general properties of early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes, which may include zirconium hydrides.

Based on the limited information available:

1. These types of complexes can react with alkanes and hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions.

2. The mechanism for these reactions typically involves σ-bond metathesis rather than oxidative addition, since the metal complexes are already in their highest oxidation state.

3. No specific details are provided about reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking for either zirconium or thorium hydrides.

4. The text does not discuss the preparation or specific structures of silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

5. No information is given about alkane metathesis reactions for these complexes.

Without more specific information about the two types of supported hydrides mentioned in the question, a detailed comparison of their properties and catalytic behavior cannot be made based solely on this literature excerpt.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文本仅简要提到了早期d0过渡金属或镧系氢化物络合物的一般特性，其中可能包括锆氢化物。

基于有限的可用信息：

1. 这些类型的络合物可以在相对较低的温度下与烷烃和氢气反应，参与交换反应。

2. 这些反应的机理通常涉及σ-键复分解而不是氧化加成，因为金属络合物已经处于最高氧化态。

3. 文本没有提供关于锆或钍氢化物的反应速率、选择性或氢解和链行走作用的具体细节。

4. 文本没有讨论硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的制备或具体结构。

5. 没有给出这些络合物的烷烃复分解反应的信息。

由于缺乏问题中提到的两种负载氢化物的更具体信息，仅凭这段文献摘录无法对它们的性质和催化行为进行详细比较。

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions early d0-transition metal hydrides participating in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures via σ-bond metathesis. It does not specifically discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their supports, or provide details on mechanisms, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of different processes like hydrogenolysis and chain walking.

Without more specific information on the two catalytic systems in question, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this limited excerpt. More detailed literature focused on silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides would be needed to adequately address the question.

所提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文本仅简要提到早期d0过渡金属氢化物在低温下通过σ-键复分解与烷烃发生交换反应。它没有具体讨论锆或钍氢化物、它们的载体,也没有提供关于机理、反应速率、选择性或不同过程(如氢解和链行走)作用的详细信息。

仅凭这段有限的摘录,无法对所询问的两种催化体系进行全面比较。需要更多关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的详细文献,才能充分回答这个问题。

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions that early d0-transition metal hydride complexes (which would include zirconium hydrides) can participate in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures. These reactions are said to proceed via σ-bond metathesis due to the metal being in its highest oxidation state.

The document does not provide specific details on:
- Preparation methods for either catalyst
- Structural information
- Catalytic properties beyond mentioning exchange reactions
- Mechanisms of H/D exchange or alkane metathesis
- Reaction rates or selectivity
- Roles of hydrogenolysis or chain walking

More comprehensive sources would be needed to adequately address the question's specific points about zirconium and thorium hydride catalysts.

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only provides general information about early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes participating in exchange reactions at low temperatures, typically through σ-bond metathesis. 

The document does not specifically discuss silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It also lacks detailed information on their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes.

The limited relevant information suggests that both zirconium and thorium, being early transition metals, may participate in exchange reactions with alkanes or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures. These reactions likely proceed through σ-bond metathesis rather than oxidative addition, as the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state.

Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive comparison of these two catalytic systems or discuss their detailed mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions.

所提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比在C-H键活化反应中的硅胶负载锆氢化物和氧化铝负载钍氢化物。文本仅提供了早期d0过渡金属或镧系氢化物复合物在低温下参与交换反应的一般信息，通常通过σ-键复分解进行。

文档没有具体讨论硅胶负载锆氢化物或氧化铝负载钍氢化物。它也缺乏关于它们的制备、结构、催化性质、反应速率、选择性或氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的详细信息。

有限的相关信息表明，锆和钍作为早期过渡金属，可能在相对较低的温度下与烷烃或氢参与交换反应。这些反应可能通过σ-键复分解而不是氧化加成进行，因为金属复合物处于最高氧化态。

没有文本中更具体的信息，无法对这两个催化系统进行全面比较，也无法讨论它们在H/D交换和烷烃复分解反应中的详细机理。
