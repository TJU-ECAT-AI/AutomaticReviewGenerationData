The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions that early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes can participate in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures. These reactions typically proceed through σ-bond metathesis because the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot undergo oxidative addition.

The literature does not contain specific details about the preparation, structure, or catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It also lacks information on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes. Without more comprehensive data, a detailed comparison of these two catalyst systems cannot be made based solely on the provided text.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文本仅简要提到早期d0过渡金属或镧系元素氢化物络合物可以在低温下与烷烃参与交换反应。这些反应通常通过σ-键复分解进行，因为金属络合物处于最高氧化态，原则上不能进行氧化加成。

文献中没有关于硅胶负载锆氢化物或氧化铝负载钍氢化物的制备、结构或催化性质的具体细节。它也缺乏有关反应速率、选择性以及氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的信息。没有更全面的数据，仅根据提供的文本无法对这两种催化剂系统进行详细比较。
