[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"

[2] "which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions that early d0-transition metal hydride complexes (which would include zirconium hydrides) can participate in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures. These reactions are said to proceed via σ-bond metathesis due to the metal being in its highest oxidation state.

The document does not provide specific details on:
- Preparation methods for either catalyst
- Structural information
- Catalytic properties beyond mentioning exchange reactions
- Mechanisms of H/D exchange or alkane metathesis
- Reaction rates or selectivity
- Roles of hydrogenolysis or chain walking

More comprehensive sources would be needed to adequately address the question's specific points about zirconium and thorium hydride catalysts.

所提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的情况。文本仅简要提到早期d0过渡金属氢化物络合物(包括锆氢化物)可以在低温下与烷烃进行交换反应。由于金属处于最高氧化态,这些反应据说是通过σ键复分解进行的。

文件没有提供以下具体细节:
- 两种催化剂的制备方法
- 结构信息
- 除提到交换反应外的催化性能
- H/D交换或烷烃复分解的机理
- 反应速率或选择性
- 氢解或链行走的作用

需要更全面的资料来充分解答问题中关于锆和钍氢化物催化剂的具体要点。
