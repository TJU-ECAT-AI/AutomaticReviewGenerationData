[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"

[2] "which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions early d0-transition metal hydrides participating in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures via σ-bond metathesis. It does not specifically discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their supports, or provide details on mechanisms, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of different processes like hydrogenolysis and chain walking.

Without more specific information on the two catalytic systems in question, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this limited excerpt. More detailed literature focused on silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides would be needed to adequately address the question.

所提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文本仅简要提到早期d0过渡金属氢化物在低温下通过σ-键复分解与烷烃发生交换反应。它没有具体讨论锆或钍氢化物、它们的载体,也没有提供关于机理、反应速率、选择性或不同过程(如氢解和链行走)作用的详细信息。

仅凭这段有限的摘录,无法对所询问的两种催化体系进行全面比较。需要更多关于二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的详细文献,才能充分回答这个问题。
