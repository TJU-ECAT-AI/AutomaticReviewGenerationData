The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only provides general information about early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes participating in exchange reactions at low temperatures, typically through σ-bond metathesis. 

The document does not specifically discuss silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides. It also lacks detailed information on their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking in these processes.

The limited relevant information suggests that both zirconium and thorium, being early transition metals, may participate in exchange reactions with alkanes or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures. These reactions likely proceed through σ-bond metathesis rather than oxidative addition, as the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state.

Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive comparison of these two catalytic systems or discuss their detailed mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions.

所提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比在C-H键活化反应中的硅胶负载锆氢化物和氧化铝负载钍氢化物。文本仅提供了早期d0过渡金属或镧系氢化物复合物在低温下参与交换反应的一般信息，通常通过σ-键复分解进行。

文档没有具体讨论硅胶负载锆氢化物或氧化铝负载钍氢化物。它也缺乏关于它们的制备、结构、催化性质、反应速率、选择性或氢解和链行走在这些过程中的作用的详细信息。

有限的相关信息表明，锆和钍作为早期过渡金属，可能在相对较低的温度下与烷烃或氢参与交换反应。这些反应可能通过σ-键复分解而不是氧化加成进行，因为金属复合物处于最高氧化态。

没有文本中更具体的信息，无法对这两个催化系统进行全面比较，也无法讨论它们在H/D交换和烷烃复分解反应中的详细机理。
