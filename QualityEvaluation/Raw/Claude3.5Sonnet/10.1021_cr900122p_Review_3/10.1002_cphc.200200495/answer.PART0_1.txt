[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"

[2] "which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions general properties of early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes, which may include zirconium hydrides.

Based on the limited information available:

1. These types of complexes can react with alkanes and hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions.

2. The mechanism for these reactions typically involves σ-bond metathesis rather than oxidative addition, since the metal complexes are already in their highest oxidation state.

3. No specific details are provided about reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking for either zirconium or thorium hydrides.

4. The text does not discuss the preparation or specific structures of silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

5. No information is given about alkane metathesis reactions for these complexes.

Without more specific information about the two types of supported hydrides mentioned in the question, a detailed comparison of their properties and catalytic behavior cannot be made based solely on this literature excerpt.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文本仅简要提到了早期d0过渡金属或镧系氢化物络合物的一般特性，其中可能包括锆氢化物。

基于有限的可用信息：

1. 这些类型的络合物可以在相对较低的温度下与烷烃和氢气反应，参与交换反应。

2. 这些反应的机理通常涉及σ-键复分解而不是氧化加成，因为金属络合物已经处于最高氧化态。

3. 文本没有提供关于锆或钍氢化物的反应速率、选择性或氢解和链行走作用的具体细节。

4. 文本没有讨论硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的制备或具体结构。

5. 没有给出这些络合物的烷烃复分解反应的信息。

由于缺乏问题中提到的两种负载氢化物的更具体信息，仅凭这段文献摘录无法对它们的性质和催化行为进行详细比较。
