Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides, alumina-supported thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be a brief citation or reference to an article about alumina-supported single-site catalysts, but does not provide any details about the specific catalysts or reactions mentioned in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, it is not possible to compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of these materials or discuss their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions.

给定的文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物、氧化铝负载的钍氢化物或它们在C-H键活化反应中的催化性质的任何信息。这份文件似乎是一篇关于氧化铝负载的单点催化剂的文章的简短引用或参考，但没有提供问题中提到的具体催化剂或反应的任何细节。由于所提供的文本中没有相关信息，无法比较和对比这些材料的制备、结构和催化性质，也无法讨论它们在H/D交换和烷烃复分解反应中的机理。
