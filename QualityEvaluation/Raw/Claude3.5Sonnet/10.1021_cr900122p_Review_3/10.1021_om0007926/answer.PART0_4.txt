[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."

[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[3] "More specifically, H2/D2 exchange to an equilibrium distribution was instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."

[5] "From this analysis, we obtain an activation energy of Ea = 7.0 (1) kcal/mol and a large negative entropy of activation ΔS = 27(3) eu. These observations are significant in that they imply that the reaction proceeds via a constrained transition state. A likely possibility is a four-center transition state (σ-bond metathesis), TS A and B, shown in Figure 3."

The literature provides detailed information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides but does not contain information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can summarize the information provided about the zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by first anchoring tetraalkyl zirconium complexes on partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation.

Structure: The supported zirconium species have a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure.

Catalytic properties: These materials are highly active catalysts for olefin polymerization and can catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

H/D exchange mechanism: The H2/D2 exchange is extremely fast, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol. The CH4/D2 exchange proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis pathway, characterized by a low activation energy (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and a large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu).

Reaction rates: H2/D2 exchange is instantaneous, while CH4/D2 exchange is slower but occurs readily at elevated temperatures.

The mechanism involves a four-center transition state, consistent with σ-bond metathesis. The study does not provide specific information on alkane metathesis or chain walking processes for this catalyst.

文献提供了有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物的详细信息，但没有包含关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。因此，无法进行直接比较。然而，我可以总结一下关于锆氢化物的信息：

制备：硅胶负载的锆氢化物是通过首先将四烷基锆络合物锚定在部分脱羟基的硅胶表面上，然后进行氢化制备而成。

结构：负载的锆物种具有三(硅氧基)/单(氢)结构。

催化性质：这些材料是高活性的烯烃聚合催化剂，并且可以在温和条件下通过活化C-H键来催化烷烃的氢解。

氢/氘交换机理：氢气/氘气交换非常快，即使在液氮温度下也是如此，估计活化能的上限约为2 kcal/mol。甲烷/氘气交换通过σ键复分解途径进行，其特征是低活化能（7 ± 1 kcal/mol）和大的负活化熵（-27 ± 3 eu）。

反应速率：氢气/氘气交换是瞬时的，而甲烷/氘气交换较慢，但在升高温度时容易发生。

该机理涉及四中心过渡态，与σ键复分解一致。这项研究没有提供关于该催化剂的烷烃复分解或链行走过程的具体信息。
