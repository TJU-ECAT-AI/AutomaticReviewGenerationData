[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."

[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[3] "We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."

[5] "Two transition states can be considered in the formation of deuterated methane involving σ-bond metathesis (Figure 3). The first transition state (TS A) places the carbon atom in a central position, which provides the most direct way to accomplish this exchange, avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate (uphill in energy), and minimizes any potential steric interactions. Alternatively, the second transition state (TS B) places hydrogen in the central position which calculations suggest is the favored transition state due to the kite-shaped structure."

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, I can describe the properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides based on the given information:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by contacting tetraalkyl zirconium complexes with partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation.

Structure: The supported zirconium species likely have a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure.

Catalytic properties: These materials are highly active olefin polymerization catalysts and can catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

H/D exchange mechanism: The H/D exchange between CH4 and D2 proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis pathway. This is evidenced by the low activation energy (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu).

Two possible transition states are proposed for the σ-bond metathesis:
1. A transition state with the carbon atom in a central position
2. A transition state with the hydrogen atom in a central position (favored due to its kite-shaped structure)

Reaction rates: H2/D2 exchange is extremely fast, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol. CH4/D2 exchange is slower but still occurs readily at elevated temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information about selectivity, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes for these catalysts.

文献中没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，根据给出的信息，我可以描述二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的性质：

制备：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四烷基锆络合物与部分脱羟基的二氧化硅表面接触，然后进行氢化制备而成。

结构：负载的锆物种可能具有三(硅氧基)/单(氢化物)结构。

催化性质：这些材料是高活性的烯烃聚合催化剂，并且可以在温和条件下通过活化C-H键来催化烷烃的氢解。

H/D交换机理：CH4和D2之间的H/D交换通过σ键复分解途径进行。这一点从低活化能（7 ± 1 kcal/mol）和大的负活化熵（-27 ± 3 eu）得到证实。

对于σ键复分解，提出了两种可能的过渡态：
1. 碳原子处于中心位置的过渡态
2. 氢原子处于中心位置的过渡态（由于其风筝状结构而受到青睐）

反应速率：H2/D2交换极快，估计活化能的上限约为2 kcal/mol。CH4/D2交换较慢，但在升高温度时仍能容易地进行。

文献没有提供关于这些催化剂的选择性、氢解或链行走过程的具体信息。
