[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts. Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[2] "Measured H/D exchange rates between methane and hydrogen support the view that these reactions proceed via σ-bond metathesis. Evidence for this mechanism is based on the low energy of activation and the high negative entropy of activation."

[3] "From this analysis, we obtain an activation energy of Ea = 7.0 (1) kcal/mol and a large negative entropy of activation ΔS = 27(3) eu. These observations are significant in that they imply that the reaction proceeds via a constrained transition state. A likely possibility is a four-center transition state (σ-bond metathesis), TS A and B, shown in Figure 3."

[4] "We find that H2/D2 exchange is too fast for us to measure and that D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than exchange between CH4 and CD4 (results to be reported separately)."

The literature provides information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides but does not discuss alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, we can describe the properties of the zirconium hydride catalysts:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by anchoring tetraalkyl zirconium complexes on partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation.

Structure: The catalysts have a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure.

Catalytic properties: These materials are highly active for olefin polymerization and can catalyze the hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

Mechanism: H/D exchange reactions proceed via σ-bond metathesis, supported by the low activation energy (7.0 kcal/mol) and large negative entropy of activation (-27 eu). This suggests a constrained, four-center transition state.

Reaction rates: H2/D2 exchange is extremely fast, even at very low temperatures. D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than CH4/CD4 exchange.

The literature does not provide information on selectivity, chain walking, or alkane metathesis for these catalysts.

该文献提供了有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物的信息，但未讨论氧化铝负载的钍氢化物。因此，无法进行直接比较。但我们可以描述锆氢化物催化剂的性质：

制备：硅胶负载的锆氢化物是通过将四烷基锆络合物固定在部分脱羟基的硅胶表面上，然后进行氢化制备而成。

结构：这些催化剂具有三(硅氧基)/单(氢化物)结构。

催化性质：这些材料对烯烃聚合具有高活性，并且可以在温和条件下通过活化C-H键来催化烷烃的氢解。

机理：氢/氘交换反应通过σ键复分解进行，这一点由低活化能（7.0 kcal/mol）和大的负活化熵（-27 eu）所支持。这表明存在一个受限的四中心过渡态。

反应速率：H2/D2交换非常快，即使在很低的温度下也是如此。D2/CH4交换比CH4/CD4交换快得多。

文献中没有提供关于这些催化剂的选择性、链行走或烷烃复分解的信息。
