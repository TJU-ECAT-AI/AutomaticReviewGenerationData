[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."

[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[3] "We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol. Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."

[4] "Two transition states can be considered in the formation of deuterated methane involving σ-bond metathesis (Figure 3). The first transition state (TS A) places the carbon atom in a central position, which provides the most direct way to accomplish this exchange, avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate (uphill in energy), and minimizes any potential steric interactions."

[5] "We find that H2/D2 exchange is too fast for us to measure and that D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than exchange between CH4 and CD4 (results to be reported separately)."

The literature provides information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides but does not mention alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, we can discuss the properties and catalytic behavior of the zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by anchoring tetraalkyl zirconium complexes on partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation.

Structure: The supported zirconium species likely have a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) structure.

Catalytic properties: These materials are highly active in olefin polymerization and can catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

H/D exchange mechanism: The exchange process between CH4 and D2 is consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway. This is evidenced by the low activation energy (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu).

Reaction rates: H2/D2 exchange is extremely fast, even at very low temperatures, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol. D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than CH4/CD4 exchange.

Transition states: Two possible transition states are proposed for the σ-bond metathesis mechanism in H/D exchange, with one placing the carbon atom in a central position and the other placing hydrogen in the central position.

The literature does not provide information on alkane metathesis or chain walking processes for these catalysts. The role of hydrogenolysis is mentioned but not elaborated upon in detail.

文献提供了有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物的信息，但没有提到氧化铝负载的钍氢化物。因此，无法直接进行比较。但我们可以讨论锆氢化物的性质和催化行为：

制备：硅胶负载的锆氢化物是通过将四烷基锆配合物固定在部分脱羟基的硅胶表面上，然后进行氢化制备而成。

结构：负载的锆物种可能具有三(硅氧基)/单(氢化物)结构。

催化性质：这些材料在烯烃聚合中具有高活性，并且可以在温和条件下通过活化C-H键来催化烷烃的氢解。

H/D交换机理：CH4和D2之间的交换过程与σ键复分解途径一致。这从低活化能（7 ± 1 kcal/mol）和大的负活化熵（-27 ± 3 eu）得到证实。

反应速率：H2/D2交换非常快，即使在很低的温度下也是如此，活化能的估计上限约为2 kcal/mol。D2/CH4交换比CH4/CD4交换快得多。

过渡态：H/D交换的σ键复分解机理提出了两种可能的过渡态，一种将碳原子置于中心位置，另一种将氢置于中心位置。

文献没有提供关于这些催化剂的烷烃复分解或链行走过程的信息。提到了氢解的作用，但没有详细阐述。
