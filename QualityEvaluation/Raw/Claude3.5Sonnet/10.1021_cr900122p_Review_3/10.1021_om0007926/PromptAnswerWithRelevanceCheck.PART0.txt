[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts. Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[2] "More specifically, H2/D2 exchange to an equilibrium distribution was instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."

[3] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."

[4] "From this analysis, we obtain an activation energy of Ea = 7.0 (1) kcal/mol and a large negative entropy of activation ΔS = 27(3) eu. These observations are significant in that they imply that the reaction proceeds via a constrained transition state. A likely possibility is a four-center transition state (σ-bond metathesis), TS A and B, shown in Figure 3."

The literature provides information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides but does not contain data on alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, we can discuss the properties and catalytic behavior of the zirconium hydrides based on the available information:

Preparation and Structure: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by anchoring tetraalkyl zirconium complexes on partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation. The resulting structure is consistent with a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) configuration.

Catalytic Properties: These materials are highly active catalysts for olefin polymerization and can catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

H/D Exchange Mechanism: The H/D exchange between H2 and D2 is extremely fast, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol. The exchange between CH4 and D2 is characterized by a low activation energy (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and a large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu).

Reaction Mechanism: The kinetic parameters suggest that the C-H bond activation proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, involving a constrained four-center transition state.

Reaction Rates: H2/D2 exchange is instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, while CH4/D2 exchange occurs readily at elevated temperatures (50-100°C).

The literature does not provide specific information on selectivity, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes for this catalyst system. Additionally, without information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides, it's not possible to make comparisons or discuss differences in their catalytic behavior.

文献提供了有关二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的信息，但没有包含氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的数据。因此，无法进行直接比较。但是，我们可以根据可用信息讨论锆氢化物的性质和催化行为：

制备和结构：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四烷基锆络合物锚定在部分脱羟基的二氧化硅表面上，然后进行氢化而制备的。得到的结构与三(硅氧基)/单(氢)配置一致。

催化性质：这些材料是高活性的烯烃聚合催化剂，可以在温和条件下通过活化C-H键来催化烷烃的氢解。

H/D交换机理：H2和D2之间的H/D交换非常快，估计活化能的上限约为2 kcal/mol。CH4和D2之间的交换特征是低活化能（7 ± 1 kcal/mol）和大的负活化熵（-27 ± 3 eu）。

反应机理：动力学参数表明，C-H键活化是通过σ键复分解机制进行的，涉及一个受限的四中心过渡态。

反应速率：即使在液氮温度下，H2/D2交换也是瞬时的，而CH4/D2交换在升高的温度下（50-100°C）容易发生。

文献没有提供关于这个催化剂系统的选择性、氢解或链行走过程的具体信息。此外，由于缺乏关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息，无法比较或讨论它们在催化行为上的差异。
