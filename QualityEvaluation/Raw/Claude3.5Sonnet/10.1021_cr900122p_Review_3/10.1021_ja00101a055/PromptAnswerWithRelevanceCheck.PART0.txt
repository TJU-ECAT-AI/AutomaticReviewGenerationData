Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The provided text only contains a title and basic publication information for an article about an iridium complex supported on silica. It does not contain any information about zirconium or thorium hydrides supported on silica or alumina, their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions. There is no data provided on reaction rates, selectivity, or processes like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking. The literature given is insufficient to address the detailed comparisons and contrasts requested in the question.

基于所给的文献无法回答这个问题。提供的文本仅包含一篇关于硅胶负载铱络合物的文章的标题和基本出版信息。它不包含任何关于硅胶或氧化铝负载的锆或钍氢化物的信息，也没有涉及它们的制备、结构、催化性质，或在C-H键活化反应中的机理。文中没有提供关于反应速率、选择性，或σ键复分解、氢解和链行走等过程的数据。给出的文献不足以解答问题中要求的详细比较和对比。

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document appears to be about an iridium complex on silica and does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. There is no information about reaction rates, selectivity, σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, or chain walking processes for these materials. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有任何关于比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的信息。该文档似乎是关于二氧化硅上的铱配合物的，并没有讨论锆或钍氢化物、它们的制备、结构、催化性质，或在H/D交换和烷烃复分解中的机理。对于这些材料的反应速率、选择性、σ-键复分解、氢解或链行走过程也没有信息。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be a brief citation for an article about iridium complexes on silica supports, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is insufficient information to answer the question about preparation, structure, catalytic properties, mechanisms, reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of various processes in zirconium and thorium hydride systems.
