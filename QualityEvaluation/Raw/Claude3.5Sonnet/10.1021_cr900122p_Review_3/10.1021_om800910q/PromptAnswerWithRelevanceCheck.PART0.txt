Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text appears to be about dehydrofluorination of hydrofluorocarbons by titanium alkylidynes, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is no mention of zirconium hydrides, thorium hydrides, or their catalytic properties in C-H bond activation, H/D exchange, or alkane metathesis reactions. The document also does not discuss reaction mechanisms, rates, selectivity, or processes like σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking for these specific catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献不包含任何与比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的相关信息。这篇文章似乎是关于钛烯基化合物对氢氟烃的脱氢氟化作用，与所问的问题无关。文中没有提到锆氢化物、钍氢化物或它们在C-H键活化、H/D交换或烷烃复分解反应中的催化性质。该文献也没有讨论这些特定催化剂的反应机理、速率、选择性，或σ键复分解、氢解和链行走等过程。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
