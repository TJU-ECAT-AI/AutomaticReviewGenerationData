          [1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."

[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[3] "More specifically, H2/D2 exchange to an equilibrium distribution was instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."

[5] "From this analysis, we obtain an activation energy of Ea = 7.0 (1) kcal/mol and a large negative entropy of activation ΔS = 27(3) eu. These observations are significant in that they imply that the reaction proceeds via a constrained transition state. A likely possibility is a four-center transition state (σ-bond metathesis), TS A and B, shown in Figure 3."

[6] "Two transition states can be considered in the formation of deuterated methane involving σ-bond metathesis (Figure 3). The first transition state (TS A) places the carbon atom in a central position, which provides the most direct way to accomplish this exchange, avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate (uphill in energy), and minimizes any potential steric interactions. Alternatively, the second transition state (TS B) places hydrogen in the central position which calculations suggest is the favored transition state due to the kite-shaped structure."

[7] "We find that H2/D2 exchange is too fast for us to measure and that D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than exchange between CH4 and CD4 (results to be reported separately)."

          The literature provides detailed information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides but does not contain information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, we can summarize the information provided about the zirconium hydrides:

Preparation and Structure: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by anchoring tetraalkyl zirconium complexes on partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation. The resulting structure is consistent with a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) configuration.

Catalytic Properties: These materials are highly active catalysts for olefin polymerization and can catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

H/D Exchange Mechanism: The H/D exchange process proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis pathway. This is evidenced by the low activation energy (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu) for CH4/D2 exchange. Two possible transition states are proposed for the σ-bond metathesis:
1. A transition state with the carbon atom in a central position
2. A transition state with the hydrogen atom in a central position (favored due to its kite-shaped structure)

Reaction Rates: H2/D2 exchange is extremely fast, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol. D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than CH4/CD4 exchange, but slower than H2/D2 exchange.

The literature does not provide specific information on selectivity, alkane metathesis, or chain walking processes for this catalyst system. The role of hydrogenolysis is mentioned but not elaborated upon in detail.

          文献提供了有关二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物的详细信息，但没有包含关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。因此，无法进行直接比较。但是，我们可以总结一下关于锆氢化物的信息：

制备和结构：二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物是通过将四烷基锆络合物锚定在部分脱羟基的二氧化硅表面上，然后进行氢化而制备的。得到的结构与三(硅氧基)/单(氢)配置一致。

催化性质：这些材料是高活性的烯烃聚合催化剂，并且可以在温和条件下通过活化C-H键来催化烷烃的氢解。

H/D交换机理：H/D交换过程通过σ键复分解途径进行。这从CH4/D2交换的低活化能（7 ± 1 kcal/mol）和大的负活化熵（-27 ± 3 eu）得到证实。对于σ键复分解，提出了两种可能的过渡态：
1. 碳原子处于中心位置的过渡态
2. 氢原子处于中心位置的过渡态（由于其风筝状结构而受到青睐）

反应速率：H2/D2交换非常快，即使在液氮温度下也是如此，估计活化能的上限约为2 kcal/mol。D2/CH4交换比CH4/CD4交换快得多，但比H2/D2交换慢。

文献没有提供关于这个催化剂系统的选择性、烷烃复分解或链行走过程的具体信息。提到了氢解的作用，但没有详细阐述。
