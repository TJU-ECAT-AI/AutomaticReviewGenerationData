          [1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."

          Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides on silica surfaces. The bis-hydride species is more reactive towards CH4. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but with differences:

1. Zirconium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures
- Reaction occurs via stepwise insertion of deuterium
- Very fast, even below room temperature
- Two-step mechanism: 
  a) CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate
  b) Hydrogenolysis, regenerating metal hydride and incorporating deuterium in alkane

2. Thorium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures
- Fast reaction rates (800-1200 h^-1)
- Slightly selective for terminal CH bonds
- Overall deuterium incorporation not selective
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during H/D exchange

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
Zirconium hydrides are very fast, even at low temperatures. Thorium hydrides show high rates (800-1200 h^-1) with slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds.

Role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking:
Zirconium hydrides use σ-bond metathesis for CH bond activation, followed by hydrogenolysis. Thorium hydrides involve β-H transfer and chain walking, explaining cis-trans isomerization.

The information provided does not specifically address alkane metathesis for these systems.

          制备和结构：
二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物在二氧化硅表面上制备为单氢化物和双氢化物的混合物。双氢化物对CH4的反应性更高。氧化铝负载的钍氢化物是通过在H2下处理脱羟基氧化铝上负载的Th(allyl)4生成的。

催化性质和机理：
两个系统都能催化H/D交换反应，但存在差异：

1. 锆氢化物：
- 催化H2/D2或CH4/D2混合物中的H/D交换
- 反应通过氘的逐步插入进行
- 反应非常快，即使在室温以下也是如此
- 两步机理：
  a) 通过σ键复分解进行CH键活化，形成金属-烷基中间体
  b) 氢解，再生金属氢化物并将氘掺入烷烃

2. 钍氢化物：
- 催化D2/烷烃混合物中的H/D交换
- 反应速度快（800-1200 h^-1）
- 对端基CH键略有选择性
- 整体氘掺入不具选择性
- 二甲基环己烷在H/D交换过程中发生顺反异构化

反应速率和选择性：
锆氢化物反应非常快，即使在低温下也是如此。钍氢化物显示出高反应速率（800-1200 h^-1），对端基CH键有轻微的选择性。

σ键复分解、氢解和链行走的作用：
锆氢化物使用σ键复分解进行CH键活化，随后进行氢解。钍氢化物涉及β-H转移和链行走，解释了顺反异构化现象。

提供的信息未特别涉及这些系统的烷烃复分解。
