[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"

          [2] "which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition."

[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4"

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species"

[5] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation"

[6] "However, we cannot yet exclude an oxidative addition of the C-H bond of alkanes on a tantalum(III) surface species followed by an elimination of hydrogen"

"The adsorption of organoactinide complexes on dehydroxylated alumina (DA ) yields coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for several demanding chemical transformations."

"Thus, in the case of Th(η5-allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA), facile arene hydrogenation and alkane activation processes can be effected in slurry reactions at 90°C and PH2 = 30-180 psi."

"Active site characterization using D2O poisoning, hydrogenolysis, and CH3Cl dosing indicates ~8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant."

"The mechanisms for the above processes are discussed in terms of electrophilic four-center activation processes in which the active sites appear to bear sterically significant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation."

"C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity and in an order which does not parallel C-H bond dissociation energies: primary > secondary > tertiary, and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered."

"A plausible mechanistic scenario for the activation and isomerization of alkanes is summarized in Scheme 4. The mechanistic sequence invokes presumably endothermic Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway (e.g. eqn. (13) ); E, Scheme 4 [46] followed by deuterolysis (F, the microscopic reverse) [33]."

"Cycloaklane skeletal isomerization would then occur via a β-H elimination (G) and readdition of the Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond."

"Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of ~25000 h-1 per active site and cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 at ~1300 h-1 per active site."

[1] "Silica-supported molecular zirconium hydride species have been the subject of numerous investigations and have been identified as highly active olefin polymerization catalysts."

[2] "Recently it has been shown that these materials catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating carbonhydrogen bonds under relatively mild conditions."

[3] "More specifically, H2/D2 exchange to an equilibrium distribution was instantaneous even at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We estimate the upper bound for the activation energy to be about 2 kcal/mol."

[4] "Moreover, the exchange kinetics between CH4 and D2 are characterized by a large negative entropy of activation (27  3 eu) and relatively low energy of activation (7  1 kcal/mol), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway."

[5] "From this analysis, we obtain an activation energy of Ea = 7.0 (1) kcal/mol and a large negative entropy of activation ΔS = 27(3) eu. These observations are significant in that they imply that the reaction proceeds via a constrained transition state. A likely possibility is a four-center transition state (σ-bond metathesis), TS A and B, shown in Figure 3."

[6] "Two transition states can be considered in the formation of deuterated methane involving σ-bond metathesis (Figure 3). The first transition state (TS A) places the carbon atom in a central position, which provides the most direct way to accomplish this exchange, avoids the formation of a ZrMe intermediate (uphill in energy), and minimizes any potential steric interactions. Alternatively, the second transition state (TS B) places hydrogen in the central position which calculations suggest is the favored transition state due to the kite-shaped structure."

[7] "We find that H2/D2 exchange is too fast for us to measure and that D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than exchange between CH4 and CD4 (results to be reported separately)."

[1] "The silica-supported zirconium hydrides catalyst have been obtained by the grafting of tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex on partially dehydroxylated silica followed by a treatment under hydrogen [64]. These reactions lead to the formation of (SiO)3ZrH 3a [62,63,65,66] as the major supported species"

[2] "Recent advances in solid state NMR spectroscopy techniques have allowed us to identify another supported species which seems to be present in smaller but nevertheless significant amounts on the surface: (SiO)2ZrH2 3b [6]."

[3] "These two well-defined zirconium hydride complexes supported on silicaalumina [67], already known to catalyse ethylene or propylene polymerisation [68], have been also found to depolymerise the resulting polymers [69]."

[4] "With group 4 metal hydrides, the proposed mechanism of this catalytic reaction involves a -alkyl transfer [4153] as the key step of the CC bond cleavage"

[5] "The silica-supported tantalum hydride, [(SiO)2TaH], and the silica-supported zirconium hydrides [(SiO)2ZrH2] and [(SiO)3ZrH] both catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes but with a major difference between the two metalstantalum hydride is able to cleave the CC bond of ethane whereas zirconium hydrides are not."

[6] "Besides alkane hydrogenolysis, the silica-supported (SiOSi)(SiO)2TaH [73] catalyses alkane metathesis, a new reaction discovered in 1996. This reaction transforms linear or branched alkanes into their higher and lower homologues [74,75]."

[7] "In order to explain the productive and the degenerative metathesis, a specific mechanism of CC bond cleavage and formation can be suggested such as a four centred -bond metathesis transition state, an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway or a carbenic mechanism"

[1] "Silica-supported hydrides of the early transition metals (Zr and Ti) are the active catalysts of the processes involving the formation and the cleavage of the CAH and CAC bonds under mild conditions."

[2] "Usually, the catalysts are prepared by coating the surface of partially dehydroxylated silica with organometallic compounds MR4 (M  Ti, Zr; R  allyl, benzyl [17], neopentyl, etc. [810,15,16]) followed by heating to 423 K under hydrogen."

[3] "According to the IR spectroscopic data, the major hydride species are M(IV) monohydrides (BSiAO)3MH [8,16] and dihydrides (BSiAO)2MH2 [4]."

[4] "The ESR studies [2, 47] revealed that some amount of the M(III) compounds (up to 5% and 30% of the total amount of the supported Zr and Ti, respectively) is also always present in the system."

[5] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides. The rates of ethylene polymerizations on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 were found to be of the same order of magnitude."

[6] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable. In contrast to this, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]) can act as the catalysts of hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."

[7] "Hydrides of the trivalent zirconium, (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, can also contribute to the hydrogenolysis reaction."

[8] "A feature of all the systems studied is low regioselectivity of the corresponding processes."

[1] "The most recent spectroscopic investigations showed that the silica supported zirconium hydrides were a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides (Scheme 15b), (231) and the study of their relative reactivity toward CH4 showed that the bis-hydride is much more reactive, (232) which is consistent with calculations. (230)"

[2] "Additionally, these species catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium (Scheme 15ce), with the former being very fast, even at temperatures below room temperature. (233)"

[3] "Computational studies have shown that the reaction pathway is probably a two-step mechanism involving CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, thus forming a metalalkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis (the reverse step), which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane (Scheme 15d). (228)"

[4] "Finally, alumina supported Th hydride species, generated by treatment under H2 of Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina, catalyze H/D exchange reaction of a D2/alkane mixture (34 bar of D2 and alkane/Th ratio = 1000, Scheme 17a and b). (242)"

[5] "This reaction is fast, with rates of 8001200 h1, and is slightly selective for terminal CH bonds (Scheme 17c). Overall, the incorporation of deuterium is not selective, and dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cistrans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, probably via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism (Scheme 17d)."
