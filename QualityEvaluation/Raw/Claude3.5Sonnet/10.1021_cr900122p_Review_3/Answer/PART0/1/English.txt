The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions that early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes (which would include zirconium hydrides) can participate in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures. These reactions are said to proceed via σ-bond metathesis due to the metal being in its highest oxidation state.

          The document does not provide specific details on:
          - Preparation methods for either catalyst
          - Structural information
          - Catalytic properties beyond mentioning exchange reactions
          - Mechanisms of H/D exchange or alkane metathesis
          - Reaction rates or selectivity
          - Roles of hydrogenolysis or chain walking

          The limited relevant information suggests that both zirconium and thorium, being early transition metals, may participate in exchange reactions with alkanes or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures. These reactions likely proceed through σ-bond metathesis rather than oxidative addition, as the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state.

          Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive comparison of these two catalytic systems or discuss their detailed mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. More comprehensive sources would be needed to adequately address the question's specific points about zirconium and thorium hydride catalysts.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it offers insights into silica-supported early transition metal hydrides, particularly zirconium and tantalum.

Preparation: The silica-supported tantalum hydride is prepared by treating grafted tantalum complexes with hydrogen at 150°C for 15 hours. The preparation method for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly described.

Structure: The silica-supported zirconium hydride is described as likely having a (-SiO)sZr-H structure with a d0 configuration. The tantalum hydride is believed to be an eight-electron TaIII monohydride linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments.

Catalytic properties: Both zirconium and tantalum hydrides can activate C-H bonds in alkanes. The zirconium hydride activates alkanes at 25°C and methane at 120°C, forming zirconium-alkyls. The tantalum hydride activates cyclooctane at room temperature and methane at 100-150°C. Both complexes can catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

Mechanisms: For the tantalum hydride, both σ-bond metathesis and oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination are proposed as possible mechanisms. The mechanism for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly discussed.

H/D exchange: The tantalum hydride can exchange reversibly with deuterium at room temperature. It also reacts with CD4 to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates or selectivity for either system.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the provided literature for these systems.

The high activity of these supported metal hydrides is attributed to their electrophilic character, immobilization, and isolation on the silica surface, which prevents deactivation through dimerization.

The document does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or discuss alkane metathesis reactions.

The literature does not provide information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides, making a direct comparison impossible. However, it offers detailed information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions:

Preparation and Structure:
- Th(η5-allyl)4 is adsorbed on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA), creating coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts.
- Only ~8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant.
- Active sites are electrophilic and bear sterically significant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation.

Catalytic Properties:
- Highly active for arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation.
- Reactions occur in slurry conditions at 90°C and 30-180 psi hydrogen pressure.
- Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of ~25,000 h-1 per active site.
- Cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 occurs at ~1,300 h-1 per active site.

Mechanism:
1. Electrophilic four-center activation processes.
2. For alkane activation:
   a. Endothermic Th-C bond formation.
   b. HD elimination via four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis.
   c. Deuterolysis (reverse of the previous step).
3. Cycloalkane skeletal isomerization via β-H elimination and readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

Selectivity:
- C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity.
- Order of reactivity: primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds.
- Sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered positions.

The mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis. Chain walking is implicated in the cycloalkane isomerization process through β-H elimination and readdition steps.

While the alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate high activity and selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions, the lack of information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides prevents a comprehensive comparison of the two systems.

The literature provides detailed information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides but does not contain information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made. However, we can summarize the information provided about the zirconium hydrides:

Preparation and Structure: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by anchoring tetraalkyl zirconium complexes on partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces, followed by hydrogenation. The resulting structure is consistent with a tris(siloxy)/mono(hydrido) configuration.

Catalytic Properties: These materials are highly active catalysts for olefin polymerization and can catalyze hydrogenolysis of paraffins by activating C-H bonds under mild conditions.

H/D Exchange Mechanism: The H/D exchange process proceeds via a σ-bond metathesis pathway. This is evidenced by the low activation energy (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) and large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu) for CH4/D2 exchange. Two possible transition states are proposed for the σ-bond metathesis:
1. A transition state with the carbon atom in a central position
2. A transition state with the hydrogen atom in a central position (favored due to its kite-shaped structure)

Reaction Rates: H2/D2 exchange is extremely fast, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol. D2/CH4 exchange is much faster than CH4/CD4 exchange, but slower than H2/D2 exchange.

The literature does not provide specific information on selectivity, alkane metathesis, or chain walking processes for this catalyst system. The role of hydrogenolysis is mentioned but not elaborated upon in detail.

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, the information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides is as follows:

Preparation: Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared by grafting tetraneopentylzirconium molecular complex onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment under hydrogen.

Structure: Two main species are formed:
1. (SiO)3ZrH as the major supported species
2. (SiO)2ZrH2 as a minor but significant species

Catalytic properties in C-H bond activation:
1. These zirconium hydrides catalyze ethylene and propylene polymerization, as well as depolymerization of the resulting polymers.
2. They are active in low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes, but cannot cleave the C-C bond of ethane.
3. The mechanism for C-C bond cleavage involves β-alkyl transfer as a key step.

Alkane metathesis: The literature mainly discusses tantalum hydrides rather than zirconium hydrides for this reaction. Silica-supported tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] catalyzes alkane metathesis, transforming linear or branched alkanes into higher and lower homologues. The mechanism may involve:
1. A four-centered σ-bond metathesis transition state
2. An oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway
3. A carbene mechanism

The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis and chain walking for these catalysts in H/D exchange reactions.

The literature does not provide information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, for silica-supported zirconium hydrides:

Preparation: These catalysts are prepared by coating partially dehydroxylated silica with organozirconium compounds (ZrR4, where R can be allyl, benzyl, neopentyl, etc.) and then heating to 423 K under hydrogen.

Structure: The system contains a mixture of surface-supported metal hydrides:
1. Zr(IV) monohydrides: (≡SiO)3ZrH
2. Zr(IV) dihydrides: (≡SiO)2ZrH2
3. Zr(III) hydrides: (≡SiO)2ZrIIIH (up to 5% of total supported Zr)

Catalytic properties:
1. These hydrides catalyze C-H and C-C bond formation and cleavage under mild conditions.
2. Zr(IV) monohydrides and dihydrides show comparable activity in ethylene polymerization.
3. Zr(IV) monohydrides are thermodynamically unfavorable for linear alkane hydrogenolysis.
4. Zr(IV) dihydrides can catalyze linear alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.
5. Zr(III) hydrides may also contribute to the hydrogenolysis reaction.

Mechanisms: The document does not provide detailed information on H/D exchange mechanisms. For alkane metathesis (hydrogenolysis), the process involves C-H bond activation followed by C-C bond cleavage. The presence of an additional binding site on dihydrides makes them more effective catalysts than monohydrides.

Reaction rates: Ethylene polymerization rates are similar for monohydrides and dihydrides. Hydrogenolysis occurs at temperatures reported in experimental studies by Basset et al.

Selectivity: All the studied systems show low regioselectivity in the catalytic processes.

The document does not specifically discuss σ-bond metathesis or chain walking mechanisms in these processes.

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are prepared as a mixture of mono- and bis-hydrides on silica surfaces. The bis-hydride species is more reactive towards CH4. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated alumina under H2.

Catalytic Properties and Mechanisms:
Both systems catalyze H/D exchange reactions, but with differences:

1. Zirconium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures
- Reaction occurs via stepwise insertion of deuterium
- Very fast, even below room temperature
- Two-step mechanism: 
  a) CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate
  b) Hydrogenolysis, regenerating metal hydride and incorporating deuterium in alkane

2. Thorium hydrides:
- Catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures
- Fast reaction rates (800-1200 h^-1)
- Slightly selective for terminal CH bonds
- Overall deuterium incorporation not selective
- Dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during H/D exchange

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
Zirconium hydrides are very fast, even at low temperatures. Thorium hydrides show high rates (800-1200 h^-1) with slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds.

Role of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking:
Zirconium hydrides use σ-bond metathesis for CH bond activation, followed by hydrogenolysis. Thorium hydrides involve β-H transfer and chain walking, explaining cis-trans isomerization.
