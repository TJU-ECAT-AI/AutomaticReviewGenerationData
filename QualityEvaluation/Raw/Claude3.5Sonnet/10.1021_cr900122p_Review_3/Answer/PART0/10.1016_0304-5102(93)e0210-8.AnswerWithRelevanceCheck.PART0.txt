          "The adsorption of organoactinide complexes on dehydroxylated alumina (DA ) yields coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts for several demanding chemical transformations."

"Thus, in the case of Th(η5-allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA), facile arene hydrogenation and alkane activation processes can be effected in slurry reactions at 90°C and PH2 = 30-180 psi."

"Active site characterization using D2O poisoning, hydrogenolysis, and CH3Cl dosing indicates ~8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant."

"The mechanisms for the above processes are discussed in terms of electrophilic four-center activation processes in which the active sites appear to bear sterically significant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation."

"C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity and in an order which does not parallel C-H bond dissociation energies: primary > secondary > tertiary, and sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered."

"A plausible mechanistic scenario for the activation and isomerization of alkanes is summarized in Scheme 4. The mechanistic sequence invokes presumably endothermic Th-C bond formation and HD elimination via a four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis pathway (e.g. eqn. (13) ); E, Scheme 4 [46] followed by deuterolysis (F, the microscopic reverse) [33]."

"Cycloaklane skeletal isomerization would then occur via a β-H elimination (G) and readdition of the Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond."

"Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of ~25000 h-1 per active site and cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 at ~1300 h-1 per active site."

          The literature does not provide information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides, making a direct comparison impossible. However, it offers detailed information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions:

Preparation and Structure:
- Th(η5-allyl)4 is adsorbed on dehydroxylated γ-alumina (DA), creating coordinatively unsaturated, highly active catalysts.
- Only ~8±1% of the Th surface sites are catalytically significant.
- Active sites are electrophilic and bear sterically significant, nonhydridic ancillary ligation.

Catalytic Properties:
- Highly active for arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation.
- Reactions occur in slurry conditions at 90°C and 30-180 psi hydrogen pressure.
- Benzene reduction occurs at a turnover frequency of ~25,000 h-1 per active site.
- Cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 occurs at ~1,300 h-1 per active site.

Mechanism:
1. Electrophilic four-center activation processes.
2. For alkane activation:
   a. Endothermic Th-C bond formation.
   b. HD elimination via four-center, heterolytic σ-bond metathesis.
   c. Deuterolysis (reverse of the previous step).
3. Cycloalkane skeletal isomerization via β-H elimination and readdition of Th+-H to the opposite face of the double bond.

Selectivity:
- C-H functionalization occurs with substantial selectivity.
- Order of reactivity: primary > secondary > tertiary C-H bonds.
- Sterically less hindered > sterically more hindered positions.

The mechanism involves σ-bond metathesis and hydrogenolysis. Chain walking is implicated in the cycloalkane isomerization process through β-H elimination and readdition steps.

While the alumina-supported thorium hydrides demonstrate high activity and selectivity in C-H bond activation reactions, the lack of information on silica-supported zirconium hydrides prevents a comprehensive comparison of the two systems.

          文献没有提供有关硅胶负载锆氢化物的信息，因此无法进行直接比较。但是，它提供了关于氧化铝负载钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的详细信息：

制备和结构：
- Th(η5-烯丙基)4被吸附在脱羟基γ-氧化铝（DA）上，形成配位不饱和的高活性催化剂。
- 只有约8±1%的钍表面位点具有催化活性。
- 活性位点是亲电性的，并带有立体显著的、非氢化物的辅助配体。

催化性质：
- 对芳烃氢化和烷烃C-H活化具有高活性。
- 反应在90°C和30-180 psi氢压的浆液条件下进行。
- 苯的还原以每个活性位点约25,000 h-1的转化频率进行。
- 环己烷与D2的C-H交换以每个活性位点约1,300 h-1的速率进行。

机理：
1. 亲电的四中心活化过程。
2. 对于烷烃活化：
   a. 吸热的Th-C键形成。
   b. 通过四中心、异裂的σ-键复分解途径进行HD消除。
   c. 氘解（前一步骤的逆过程）。
3. 环烷烃骨架异构化通过β-H消除和Th+-H重新加成到双键的另一面进行。

选择性：
- C-H官能化具有显著的选择性。
- 反应活性顺序：一级 > 二级 > 三级C-H键。
- 空间位阻小 > 空间位阻大的位置。

该机理涉及σ-键复分解和氢解。链行走过程通过β-H消除和重新加成步骤参与了环烷烃的异构化过程。

虽然氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中表现出高活性和选择性，但由于缺乏有关硅胶负载锆氢化物的信息，无法对这两个系统进行全面比较。
