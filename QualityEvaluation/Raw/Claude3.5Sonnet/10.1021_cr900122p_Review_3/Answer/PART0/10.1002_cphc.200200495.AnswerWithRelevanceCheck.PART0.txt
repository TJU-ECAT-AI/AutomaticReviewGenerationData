          [1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl complexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"

          [2] "which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition."

          The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The text only briefly mentions that early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido complexes (which would include zirconium hydrides) can participate in exchange reactions with alkanes at low temperatures. These reactions are said to proceed via σ-bond metathesis due to the metal being in its highest oxidation state.

          The document does not provide specific details on:
          - Preparation methods for either catalyst
          - Structural information
          - Catalytic properties beyond mentioning exchange reactions
          - Mechanisms of H/D exchange or alkane metathesis
          - Reaction rates or selectivity
          - Roles of hydrogenolysis or chain walking

          The limited relevant information suggests that both zirconium and thorium, being early transition metals, may participate in exchange reactions with alkanes or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures. These reactions likely proceed through σ-bond metathesis rather than oxidative addition, as the metal complexes are in their highest oxidation state.

          Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive comparison of these two catalytic systems or discuss their detailed mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis reactions. More comprehensive sources would be needed to adequately address the question's specific points about zirconium and thorium hydride catalysts.

          所提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的情况。文本仅简要提到早期d0过渡金属或镧系氢化物络合物（包括锆氢化物）可以在低温下与烷烃进行交换反应。由于金属处于最高氧化态，这些反应据说是通过σ键复分解进行的。

          文件没有提供以下具体细节:
          - 两种催化剂的制备方法
          - 结构信息
          - 除提到交换反应外的催化性能
          - H/D交换或烷烃复分解的机理
          - 反应速率或选择性
          - 氢解或链行走的作用

          有限的相关信息表明，锆和钍作为早期过渡金属，可能在相对较低的温度下与烷烃或氢参与交换反应。这些反应可能通过σ-键复分解而不是氧化加成进行，因为金属复合物处于最高氧化态。

          没有文本中更具体的信息，无法对这两个催化系统进行全面比较，也无法讨论它们在H/D交换和烷烃复分解反应中的详细机理。需要更全面的资料来充分解答问题中关于锆和钍氢化物催化剂的具体要点。
