Catalytic Mechanisms and Reactivity of Surface-Supported Metal Species in C-H Bond Activation, H/D Exchange, and Alkane Metathesis Reactions

Surface-supported metal hydrides, particularly those of early transition metals and actinides, have shown remarkable activity in C-H bond activation, H/D exchange, and alkane metathesis reactions. This review focuses on silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides, comparing their preparation, structure, and catalytic properties.

Preparation and Structure:
Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are typically prepared by grafting organozirconium compounds (e.g., tetraneopentylzirconium) onto partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment under hydrogen [10.1016/j.molcata.2003.11.028]. This process results in a mixture of surface species, primarily (≡SiO)3ZrH and (≡SiO)2ZrH2, with a small amount of Zr(III) species [10.1007/s11244-005-9259-y]. In contrast, alumina-supported thorium hydrides are generated by treating Th(η5-allyl)4 supported on dehydroxylated γ-alumina with hydrogen [10.1016/0304-5102(93)e0210-8].

Catalytic Properties in C-H Bond Activation:
Both zirconium and thorium hydrides demonstrate high activity in C-H bond activation. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides can activate alkanes at 25°C and methane at 120°C, forming zirconium-alkyls [10.1039/c39950000991]. They also catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes. Alumina-supported thorium hydrides show high activity for arene hydrogenation and alkane C-H activation at 90°C and 30-180 psi hydrogen pressure [10.1016/0304-5102(93)e0210-8].

H/D Exchange Mechanisms:
Zirconium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange in H2/D2 or CH4/D2 mixtures via a stepwise insertion of deuterium. The reaction is exceptionally fast, even below room temperature. The mechanism involves a two-step process: CH bond activation via σ-bond metathesis, forming a metal-alkyl intermediate, followed by hydrogenolysis, which regenerates the metal hydride and incorporates deuterium in the alkane [10.1021/cr900122p_3]. The activation energy for CH4/D2 exchange is low (7 ± 1 kcal/mol) with a large negative entropy of activation (-27 ± 3 eu), consistent with a σ-bond metathesis pathway [10.1021/om0007926].

Thorium hydrides catalyze H/D exchange in D2/alkane mixtures with fast reaction rates (800-1200 h^-1). The reaction shows slight selectivity for terminal CH bonds. Interestingly, dimethylcyclohexanes undergo cis-trans isomerization during the H/D exchange process, likely via β-H transfer and a chain walking mechanism [10.1021/cr900122p_3].

Alkane Metathesis:
While zirconium hydrides are not reported to catalyze alkane metathesis, silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(≡SiO)2TaH] have been shown to catalyze this reaction. The mechanism may involve a four-centered σ-bond metathesis transition state, an oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathway, or a carbene mechanism [10.1016/j.molcata.2003.11.028].

Reaction Rates and Selectivity:
Zirconium hydrides exhibit extremely fast H2/D2 exchange, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, with an estimated upper bound for activation energy of about 2 kcal/mol [10.1021/om0007926]. Thorium hydrides show high rates for benzene reduction (turnover frequency ~25,000 h^-1 per active site) and cyclohexane C-H exchange with D2 (~1,300 h^-1 per active site) [10.1016/0304-5102(93)e0210-8].

In terms of selectivity, thorium hydrides show a preference for primary over secondary and tertiary C-H bonds, and for sterically less hindered over more hindered positions [10.1016/0304-5102(93)e0210-8]. Zirconium hydride systems generally show low regioselectivity in catalytic processes [10.1007/s11244-005-9259-y].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The study of surface-supported metal hydrides in C-H bond activation, H/D exchange, and alkane metathesis reactions has revealed the importance of metal-support interactions and the role of different surface species in catalytic activity. Future research could focus on developing more selective catalysts by fine-tuning the metal-support interaction and the distribution of different surface species. The unique properties of early transition metals and actinides in these reactions suggest potential applications in isotope labeling, natural gas conversion, and the development of novel C-H functionalization methodologies. Additionally, the mechanistic insights gained from these studies could be applied to the design of new catalysts for challenging transformations, such as selective alkane functionalization or the activation of traditionally inert C-H bonds. Further investigation into the role of metal oxidation state and ligand environment could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for these important reactions.
