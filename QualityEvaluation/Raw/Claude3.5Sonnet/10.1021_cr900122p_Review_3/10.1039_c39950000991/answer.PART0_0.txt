[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4 [eqn. (1)]."

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species [eqn. (3)]."

[5] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation [eqn. (5)]."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into silica-supported early transition metal hydrides, particularly zirconium and tantalum.

Silica-supported zirconium hydride, likely with a (-SiO)sZr-H structure and d0 configuration, can activate C-H bonds of alkanes and methane at relatively low temperatures (25°C and 120°C respectively). This activation forms zirconium-alkyl complexes. The zirconium hydride and its hafnium analogue can also catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

The literature also describes a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex that can activate C-H bonds. This complex reacts spontaneously with cyclooctane at room temperature to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex. It can also react with CD4 at 100-150°C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

For the tantalum hydride, a σ-bond metathesis mechanism is proposed for the C-H activation, as no hydride remains on the surface after the reaction. However, an oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination is not ruled out.

The document does not provide specific information about reaction rates or selectivity. It also does not mention chain walking processes. The literature focuses more on stoichiometric reactions rather than catalytic cycles, although some catalytic activity is mentioned for the zirconium and hafnium complexes.

The high activity of these supported metal hydrides is attributed to their electrophilic character, immobilization, and isolation on the silica surface, which prevents deactivation through dimerization. This suggests that the support plays a crucial role in enhancing the reactivity of these complexes compared to their molecular counterparts.

文献中没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的表现。然而，它确实提供了一些关于硅胶负载的早期过渡金属氢化物，特别是锆和钽的见解。

硅胶负载的锆氢化物，可能具有(-SiO)sZr-H结构和d0电子构型，能够在相对较低的温度下（分别为25°C和120°C）活化烷烃和甲烷的C-H键。这种活化形成锆-烷基络合物。锆氢化物及其铪类似物还可以催化各种烷烃的低温氢解反应。

文献还描述了一种能够活化C-H键的硅胶负载钽氢化物络合物。该络合物在室温下可以自发地与环辛烷反应，形成钽-环辛基表面络合物。它还可以在100-150°C下与CD4反应，形成钽-全氘甲基物种。

对于钽氢化物，文献提出了σ键复分解机制来解释C-H活化，因为反应后表面上没有剩余的氢化物。然而，氧化加成随后氢消除的机制也未被排除。

文献没有提供具体的反应速率或选择性信息。它也没有提到链行走过程。文献更多地关注化学计量反应，而不是催化循环，尽管提到了锆和铪络合物的一些催化活性。

这些负载金属氢化物的高活性归因于它们的亲电性、固定化和在硅胶表面的隔离，这防止了通过二聚作用的失活。这表明载体在增强这些络合物的反应活性方面起着至关重要的作用，相比于它们的分子对应物。
