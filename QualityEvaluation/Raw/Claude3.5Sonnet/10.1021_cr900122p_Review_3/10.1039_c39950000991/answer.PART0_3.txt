[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4"

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species"

[5] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation"

The literature does not provide direct information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into silica-supported early transition metal hydrides, particularly zirconium and tantalum.

Preparation: The document describes the preparation of a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex, which involves grafting a tantalum complex onto silica and then treating it with hydrogen. A similar process may be used for zirconium, but the exact details are not provided.

Structure: The silica-supported zirconium hydride is described as likely having a (-SiO)sZr-H structure with a d0 configuration. The tantalum hydride is suggested to be an eight-electron TaIII monohydride (=SiO)2Ta(H) linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments.

Catalytic properties: Both silica-supported zirconium and tantalum hydrides are capable of C-H bond activation. The zirconium hydride activates alkanes and methane at 25°C and 120°C respectively, while the tantalum hydride activates cyclooctane at room temperature and methane at 100-150°C.

Mechanisms: The document suggests a σ-bond metathesis mechanism for the tantalum hydride, as no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation. However, it also mentions the possibility of an oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination. The mechanism for zirconium is not explicitly stated.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The tantalum hydride is noted to be more reactive than corresponding molecular complexes, activating cyclooctane spontaneously at room temperature. The zirconium and hafnium complexes are mentioned to catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the given text. The document does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a comparison cannot be made.

该文献没有提供直接信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的情况。然而，它确实提供了一些关于硅胶负载的早期过渡金属氢化物的见解，特别是锆和钽。

制备：文档描述了硅胶负载钽氢化物复合物的制备，这涉及将钽复合物接枝到硅胶上，然后用氢气处理。锆可能使用类似的过程，但没有提供确切的细节。

结构：硅胶负载的锆氢化物被描述为可能具有(-SiO)sZr-H结构，具有d0构型。钽氢化物被认为是八电子TaIII单氢化物(=SiO)2Ta(H)，通过两个硅氧片段连接到硅胶表面。

催化性能：硅胶负载的锆和钽氢化物都能进行C-H键活化。锆氢化物分别在25°C和120°C下活化烷烃和甲烷，而钽氢化物在室温下活化环辛烷，在100-150°C下活化甲烷。

机理：文档对钽氢化物提出了σ-键复分解机制，因为烷烃活化后表面上没有剩余的氢化物。然而，它也提到了氧化加成后氢气消除的可能性。文中没有明确说明锆的机理。

反应速率和选择性：钽氢化物被注意到比相应的分子复合物更具反应性，在室温下自发活化环辛烷。锆和铪复合物被提到可以催化各种烷烃的低温氢解。

文中没有明确讨论氢解和链行走的作用。文档没有提供关于氧化铝负载钍氢化物的信息，因此无法进行比较。
