[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4 [eqn. (1)]."

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species [eqn. (3)]."

[5] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation [eqn. (5)]."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into silica-supported early transition metal hydrides, particularly zirconium and tantalum.

Silica-supported zirconium hydride, likely with a (-SiO)sZr-H structure and d0 configuration, can activate C-H bonds of alkanes and methane at relatively low temperatures (25°C and 120°C respectively). This activation forms zirconium-alkyl complexes. The zirconium hydride and its hafnium analogue can also catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

The literature also describes a silica-supported tantalum hydride complex that can activate C-H bonds. This complex reacts spontaneously with cyclooctane at room temperature to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex. It can also react with CD4 at 100-150°C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

For the tantalum hydride, a σ-bond metathesis mechanism is proposed for the C-H activation, as no hydride remains on the surface after the reaction. However, an oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination is not ruled out.

The document does not provide specific information about reaction rates or selectivity. It also does not mention chain walking processes. The literature focuses more on stoichiometric reactions rather than catalytic cycles, although some catalytic activity is mentioned for the zirconium and hafnium complexes.

The high activity of these supported metal hydrides is attributed to their electrophilic character, immobilization, and isolation on the silica surface, which prevents deactivation through dimerization. This suggests that the support plays a crucial role in enhancing the reactivity of these complexes compared to their molecular counterparts.

文献中没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的表现。然而，它确实提供了一些关于硅胶负载的早期过渡金属氢化物，特别是锆和钽的见解。

硅胶负载的锆氢化物，可能具有(-SiO)sZr-H结构和d0电子构型，能够在相对较低的温度下（分别为25°C和120°C）活化烷烃和甲烷的C-H键。这种活化形成锆-烷基络合物。锆氢化物及其铪类似物还可以催化各种烷烃的低温氢解反应。

文献还描述了一种能够活化C-H键的硅胶负载钽氢化物络合物。该络合物在室温下可以自发地与环辛烷反应，形成钽-环辛基表面络合物。它还可以在100-150°C下与CD4反应，形成钽-全氘甲基物种。

对于钽氢化物，文献提出了σ键复分解机制来解释C-H活化，因为反应后表面上没有剩余的氢化物。然而，氧化加成随后氢消除的机制也未被排除。

文献没有提供具体的反应速率或选择性信息。它也没有提到链行走过程。文献更多地关注化学计量反应，而不是催化循环，尽管提到了锆和铪络合物的一些催化活性。

这些负载金属氢化物的高活性归因于它们的亲电性、固定化和在硅胶表面的隔离，这防止了通过二聚作用的失活。这表明载体在增强这些络合物的反应活性方面起着至关重要的作用，相比于它们的分子对应物。

The literature does not provide detailed information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, some information is provided about silica-supported zirconium and tantalum hydrides:

Preparation: The silica-supported tantalum hydride is prepared by treating grafted tantalum complexes with hydrogen at 150°C for 15 hours. The preparation method for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly described.

Structure: The tantalum hydride is believed to be an eight-electron TaIII monohydride linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments. The zirconium hydride is described as likely having a (-SiO)sZr-H structure with a d0 configuration.

Catalytic properties: Both zirconium and tantalum hydrides can activate C-H bonds in alkanes. The zirconium hydride activates alkanes at 25°C and methane at 120°C. The tantalum hydride activates cyclooctane at room temperature and methane at 100-150°C.

Mechanisms: For the tantalum hydride, both σ-bond metathesis and oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination are proposed as possible mechanisms. The mechanism for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly discussed.

H/D exchange: The tantalum hydride can exchange reversibly with deuterium at room temperature. It also reacts with CD4 to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates or selectivity for either system.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the provided literature for these systems.

The tantalum hydride is more reactive than corresponding molecular complexes, likely due to the direct grafting on silica which makes tantalum more electrophilic and allows for isolation of metal centers.

Regarding mechanisms, while σ-bond metathesis is mentioned as a common mechanism for early transition metals, the paper suggests that for the supported tantalum hydride, both σ-bond metathesis and oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination are possible pathways.

The document does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of chain walking in these processes. It also does not mention alumina-supported thorium hydrides or discuss alkane metathesis reactions.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document primarily focuses on silica-supported tantalum hydride complexes, with some mention of zirconium hydrides.

From the available information, we can say that silica-supported zirconium hydrides are able to activate C-H bonds of alkanes and methane at relatively low temperatures (25°C for alkanes, 120°C for methane). They form zirconium-alkyl complexes through this activation. These complexes can also catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

The document does not mention alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so no comparison can be made.

Regarding mechanisms, the literature suggests a σ-bond metathesis mechanism for the tantalum hydride complex, which might be similar for the zirconium hydride. This is based on the observation that no hydride remains on the surface after alkane activation.

The document mentions H/D exchange reactions with the tantalum hydride complex, occurring at room temperature for cyclooctane and at 100-150°C for CD4. However, it does not provide specific information about reaction rates or selectivity.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the context of these reactions.

In summary, while the document provides some insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported early transition metal hydrides (particularly tantalum and zirconium), it lacks the comprehensive information needed to fully answer the question, especially regarding alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

从可用信息来看，我们可以说二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物能够在相对较低的温度下（烷烃25°C，甲烷120°C）活化烷烃和甲烷的C-H键。它们通过这种活化形成锆-烷基复合物。这些复合物还可以催化各种烷烃的低温氢解。

文档没有提到氧化铝负载的钍氢化物，所以无法进行比较。

关于反应机理，文献对钽氢化物复合物提出了σ-键复分解机理，这可能与锆氢化物类似。这是基于烷烃活化后表面上没有剩余氢化物的观察结果。

文档提到了钽氢化物复合物的H/D交换反应，环辛烷在室温下进行，CD4在100-150°C下进行。然而，它没有提供关于反应速率或选择性的具体信息。

文档没有明确讨论氢解和链行走在这些反应中的作用。

总之，虽然文档提供了一些关于二氧化硅负载的早期过渡金属氢化物（特别是钽和锆）的制备、结构和催化性质的见解，但缺乏全面回答问题所需的完整信息，特别是关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。
