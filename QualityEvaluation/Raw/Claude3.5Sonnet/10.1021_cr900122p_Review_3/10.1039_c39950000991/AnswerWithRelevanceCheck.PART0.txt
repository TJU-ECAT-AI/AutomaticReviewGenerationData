          [1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4"

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species"

[5] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation"

[6] "However, we cannot yet exclude an oxidative addition of the C-H bond of alkanes on a tantalum(III) surface species followed by an elimination of hydrogen"

          The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. However, it offers insights into silica-supported early transition metal hydrides, particularly zirconium and tantalum.

Preparation: The silica-supported tantalum hydride is prepared by treating grafted tantalum complexes with hydrogen at 150°C for 15 hours. The preparation method for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly described.

Structure: The silica-supported zirconium hydride is described as likely having a (-SiO)sZr-H structure with a d0 configuration. The tantalum hydride is believed to be an eight-electron TaIII monohydride linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments.

Catalytic properties: Both zirconium and tantalum hydrides can activate C-H bonds in alkanes. The zirconium hydride activates alkanes at 25°C and methane at 120°C, forming zirconium-alkyls. The tantalum hydride activates cyclooctane at room temperature and methane at 100-150°C. Both complexes can catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

Mechanisms: For the tantalum hydride, both σ-bond metathesis and oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination are proposed as possible mechanisms. The mechanism for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly discussed.

H/D exchange: The tantalum hydride can exchange reversibly with deuterium at room temperature. It also reacts with CD4 to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates or selectivity for either system.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the provided literature for these systems.

The high activity of these supported metal hydrides is attributed to their electrophilic character, immobilization, and isolation on the silica surface, which prevents deactivation through dimerization.

The document does not provide information on alumina-supported thorium hydrides or discuss alkane metathesis reactions.

          文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。然而，它确实提供了一些关于硅胶负载的早期过渡金属氢化物的见解，特别是锆和钽。

制备：硅胶负载的钽氢化物是通过在150°C下用氢气处理接枝钽络合物15小时制备而成。文中没有明确描述锆氢化物的制备方法。

结构：硅胶负载的锆氢化物被描述为可能具有(-SiO)sZr-H结构，具有d0构型。钽氢化物被认为是一个八电子的TaIII单氢化物，通过两个硅氧片段与硅胶表面相连。

催化性质：锆和钽氢化物都能活化烷烃中的C-H键。锆氢化物在25°C下活化烷烃，在120°C下活化甲烷，形成锆-烷基化合物。钽氢化物在室温下活化环辛烷，在100-150°C下活化甲烷。两种络合物都能催化各种烷烃的低温氢解反应。

机理：对于钽氢化物，σ键复分解和氧化加成后氢消除都被提出为可能的机理。文献中没有明确讨论锆氢化物的机理。

氢/氘交换：钽氢化物可以在室温下与氘可逆交换。它还与CD4反应形成钽-全氘甲基物种。

反应速率和选择性：文献没有提供任何一个系统的具体反应速率或选择性信息。

文献中没有明确讨论这些系统中氢解和链行走的作用。

这些负载金属氢化物的高活性归因于它们的亲电性、固定化和在硅胶表面的隔离，这防止了通过二聚作用的失活。

文档没有提供关于氧化铝负载钍氢化物的信息，也没有讨论烷烃复分解反应。
