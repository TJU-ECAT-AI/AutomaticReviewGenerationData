[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4"

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species"

[5] "However, we cannot yet exclude an oxidative addition of the C-H bond of alkanes on a tantalum(III) surface species followed by an elimination of hydrogen"

The literature does not provide a direct comparison between silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides. However, it does discuss the properties of silica-supported zirconium and tantalum hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides are reported to activate C-H bonds of alkanes and methane at relatively low temperatures (25°C for alkanes, 120°C for methane) to form zirconium-alkyls. They also catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

The document focuses more on silica-supported tantalum hydrides. These complexes can activate C-H bonds in cyclooctane at room temperature and in CD4 at 100-150°C. The tantalum hydride is more reactive than corresponding molecular complexes, likely due to the direct grafting on silica which makes tantalum more electrophilic and allows for isolation of metal centers.

Regarding mechanisms, while σ-bond metathesis is mentioned as a common mechanism for early transition metals, the paper suggests that for the supported tantalum hydride, both σ-bond metathesis and oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination are possible pathways.

The document does not provide specific information on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of chain walking in these processes. It also does not mention alumina-supported thorium hydrides or discuss alkane metathesis reactions.

这篇文献没有直接比较硅胶负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物。但是,它确实讨论了硅胶负载的锆和钽氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。

据报道,硅胶负载的锆氢化物能够在相对较低的温度下(烷烃25°C,甲烷120°C)活化烷烃和甲烷的C-H键,形成锆-烷基化合物。它们还能催化各种烷烃的低温氢解反应。

文献更多地关注硅胶负载的钽氢化物。这些络合物可以在室温下活化环辛烷的C-H键,在100-150°C下活化CD4。钽氢化物比相应的分子络合物更具反应活性,这可能是由于直接接枝在硅胶上使钽更具亲电性,并允许金属中心的分离。

关于反应机理,虽然σ键复分解被提及为早期过渡金属的常见机理,但该文章指出,对于负载的钽氢化物,σ键复分解和氧化加成后氢消除都是可能的途径。

文献没有提供关于反应速率、选择性或链行走在这些过程中作用的具体信息。它也没有提到氧化铝负载的钍氢化物或讨论烷烃复分解反应。
