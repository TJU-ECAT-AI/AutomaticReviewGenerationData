[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "The same grafted complex as well as its hafnium analogue was also found to catalyse the low temperature hydrogenolysis of several alkanes such as propane, n-butane, isobutane or neopentane."

[3] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4"

[4] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species"

[5] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation"

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions. The document primarily focuses on silica-supported tantalum hydride complexes, with some mention of zirconium hydrides.

From the available information, we can say that silica-supported zirconium hydrides are able to activate C-H bonds of alkanes and methane at relatively low temperatures (25°C for alkanes, 120°C for methane). They form zirconium-alkyl complexes through this activation. These complexes can also catalyze low-temperature hydrogenolysis of various alkanes.

The document does not mention alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so no comparison can be made.

Regarding mechanisms, the literature suggests a σ-bond metathesis mechanism for the tantalum hydride complex, which might be similar for the zirconium hydride. This is based on the observation that no hydride remains on the surface after alkane activation.

The document mentions H/D exchange reactions with the tantalum hydride complex, occurring at room temperature for cyclooctane and at 100-150°C for CD4. However, it does not provide specific information about reaction rates or selectivity.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the context of these reactions.

In summary, while the document provides some insights into the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported early transition metal hydrides (particularly tantalum and zirconium), it lacks the comprehensive information needed to fully answer the question, especially regarding alumina-supported thorium hydrides.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物和氧化铝负载的钍氢化物在C-H键活化反应中的性质。文档主要关注二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物复合物，只是略微提到了锆氢化物。

从可用信息来看，我们可以说二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物能够在相对较低的温度下（烷烃25°C，甲烷120°C）活化烷烃和甲烷的C-H键。它们通过这种活化形成锆-烷基复合物。这些复合物还可以催化各种烷烃的低温氢解。

文档没有提到氧化铝负载的钍氢化物，所以无法进行比较。

关于反应机理，文献对钽氢化物复合物提出了σ-键复分解机理，这可能与锆氢化物类似。这是基于烷烃活化后表面上没有剩余氢化物的观察结果。

文档提到了钽氢化物复合物的H/D交换反应，环辛烷在室温下进行，CD4在100-150°C下进行。然而，它没有提供关于反应速率或选择性的具体信息。

文档没有明确讨论氢解和链行走在这些反应中的作用。

总之，虽然文档提供了一些关于二氧化硅负载的早期过渡金属氢化物（特别是钽和锆）的制备、结构和催化性质的见解，但缺乏全面回答问题所需的完整信息，特别是关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息。
