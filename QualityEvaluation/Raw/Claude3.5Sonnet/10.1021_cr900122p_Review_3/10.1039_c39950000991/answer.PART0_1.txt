[1] "Recently, we have reported that, in the field of surface organometallic chemistry, a silica-supported zirconium hydride, very likely (-SiO)sZr-H with a do configuration, was able to activate stoichiometrically the C-H bond of alkanes or methane, at 25 and 120 °C, respectively, to form the corresponding zirconium-alkyls."

[2] "Complex 3 reacts spontaneously at room temperature with a vapour of cyclooctane (5 torr) to form a tantalum-cyclooctyl surface complex 4"

[3] "Complex 3 also reacts with CD4 at 100-150 °C to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species"

[4] "In the present case of supported tantalum-hydride [TaIs-H 3, it may be attractive to propose a 0-bond metathesis mechanism since no hydride is left on the surface after alkane activation"

[5] "However, we cannot yet exclude an oxidative addition of the C-H bond of alkanes on a tantalum(II1) surface species followed by an elimination of hydrogen"

The literature does not provide detailed information about alumina-supported thorium hydrides, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, some information is provided about silica-supported zirconium and tantalum hydrides:

Preparation: The silica-supported tantalum hydride is prepared by treating grafted tantalum complexes with hydrogen at 150°C for 15 hours. The preparation method for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly described.

Structure: The tantalum hydride is believed to be an eight-electron TaIII monohydride linked to the silica surface by two siloxy fragments. The zirconium hydride is described as likely having a (-SiO)sZr-H structure with a d0 configuration.

Catalytic properties: Both zirconium and tantalum hydrides can activate C-H bonds in alkanes. The zirconium hydride activates alkanes at 25°C and methane at 120°C. The tantalum hydride activates cyclooctane at room temperature and methane at 100-150°C.

Mechanisms: For the tantalum hydride, both σ-bond metathesis and oxidative addition followed by hydrogen elimination are proposed as possible mechanisms. The mechanism for zirconium hydrides is not explicitly discussed.

H/D exchange: The tantalum hydride can exchange reversibly with deuterium at room temperature. It also reacts with CD4 to form a tantalum-perdeuteriomethyl species.

Reaction rates and selectivity: The literature does not provide specific information on reaction rates or selectivity for either system.

The roles of hydrogenolysis and chain walking are not explicitly discussed in the provided literature for these systems.

该文献没有提供关于氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的详细信息,因此无法直接进行比较。但是,文献提供了一些关于二氧化硅负载的锆和钽氢化物的信息:

制备:二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物是通过在150°C下用氢气处理接枝钽络合物15小时制备而成。文中没有明确描述锆氢化物的制备方法。

结构:钽氢化物被认为是一个八电子的TaIII单氢化物,通过两个硅氧片段与二氧化硅表面相连。锆氢化物被描述为可能具有(-SiO)sZr-H结构,具有d0构型。

催化性质:锆和钽氢化物都能活化烷烃中的C-H键。锆氢化物在25°C下活化烷烃,在120°C下活化甲烷。钽氢化物在室温下活化环辛烷,在100-150°C下活化甲烷。

机理:对于钽氢化物,σ键复分解和氧化加成后氢消除都被提出为可能的机理。文献中没有明确讨论锆氢化物的机理。

氢/氘交换:钽氢化物可以在室温下与氘可逆交换。它还与CD4反应形成钽-全氘甲基物种。

反应速率和选择性:文献没有提供任何一个系统的具体反应速率或选择性信息。

文献中没有明确讨论这些系统中氢解和链行走的作用。
