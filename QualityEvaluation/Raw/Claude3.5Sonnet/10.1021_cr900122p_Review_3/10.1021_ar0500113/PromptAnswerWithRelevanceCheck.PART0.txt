Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, nor does it discuss their use in C-H bond activation reactions. The document focuses on the synthesis and reactivity of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes with metal-ligand multiple bonds, particularly alkylidenes, alkylidynes, imides, and phosphinidenes. It does not cover the specific catalytic systems or mechanisms mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有任何关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息,也没有讨论它们在C-H键活化反应中的应用。该文献主要集中在低配位钛和钒配合物的合成和反应性,特别是具有金属-配体多重键的化合物,如烯基、炔基、亚胺和膦基。它没有涉及问题中提到的特定催化体系或机理。因此,无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。

The document focuses on the synthesis and reactivity of low-coordinate titanium and vanadium complexes containing metal-ligand multiple bonds, such as alkylidenes, alkylidynes, imides, and phosphinidenes. It does not discuss zirconium or thorium hydrides, their support on silica or alumina, or their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or contrast of these systems based on the given information.
