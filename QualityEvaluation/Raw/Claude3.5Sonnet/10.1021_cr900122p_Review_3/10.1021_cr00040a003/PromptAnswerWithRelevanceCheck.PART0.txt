Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the preparation, structure, and catalytic properties of silica-supported zirconium hydrides and alumina-supported thorium hydrides in C-H bond activation reactions, detailing their mechanisms in H/D exchange and alkane metathesis. Include discussions on reaction rates, selectivity, and the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about silica-supported zirconium hydrides or alumina-supported thorium hydrides, their preparation, structure, catalytic properties, or mechanisms in C-H bond activation reactions. The document focuses on the chemistry of hydrocarbon moieties on transition metal surfaces and does not discuss the specific catalysts mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison or discussion of the topics requested based on the information available in this literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于硅胶负载的锆氢化物或氧化铝负载的钍氢化物的信息,也没有提及它们的制备、结构、催化性能,或在C-H键活化反应中的机理。该文档主要关注过渡金属表面上烃基的化学性质,并未讨论问题中提到的特定催化剂。因此,基于这篇文献中可用的信息,我无法对所要求的主题进行有意义的比较或讨论。

The document does not discuss H/D exchange or alkane metathesis mechanisms for these specific catalysts, nor does it provide details on reaction rates, selectivity, or the roles of σ-bond metathesis, hydrogenolysis, and chain walking in these processes. The literature appears to focus on other aspects of organometallic chemistry and surface science, and does not cover the specific topics mentioned in the question.
