Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, and what insights can be gained from experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies regarding their performance, synergistic effects, and potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The document focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 over a Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalyst, and does not discuss bimetallic catalysts or DFT studies. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of these specific catalysts or insights from experimental and theoretical studies about them based on the given text.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂或它们在丙烷CO2-ODH和DRP反应中性能的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用CO2通过Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的过程,并未涉及双金属催化剂或DFT研究。因此,我无法根据给定的文本对这些特定催化剂进行比较,也无法提供关于它们的实验和理论研究的见解。
