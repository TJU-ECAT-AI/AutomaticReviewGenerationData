[1] "The previously reported Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[2] "Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."

[3] "The in situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

[4] "Based on previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the ODH pathway requires the adsorbed oxygen species (produced from the dissociation of CO2) to react with adsorbed CxHy fragments to form an oxygenated intermediate before further C-C bond cleavage to form CO."

[5] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a surface that contained a greater amount of Ni than Fe, it was inferred that metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition and catalytic behavior:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 contains iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is selective for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), producing propylene. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is selective for DRP (dry reforming of propane), producing syngas.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2.

Reaction mechanisms: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the CO2-ODHP pathway involves adsorbed oxygen species reacting with CxHy fragments to form oxygenated intermediates. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the DRP pathway likely involves C-C bond breaking to form syngas.

Experimental insights: In situ XANES studies reveal that both catalysts contain metallic Ni, but Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has oxidized Fe, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 has metallic Pt.

Theoretical (DFT) insights: In Fe3Ni1/CeO2, Fe segregates to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding, promoting CO2-ODHP. In Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring DRP.

Synergistic effects: The bimetallic nature of both catalysts enhances their performance compared to monometallic counterparts, suggesting synergistic interactions between the metal components.

Environmental potential: Both catalysts offer pathways for CO2 utilization and valuable product formation (propylene or syngas), contributing to CO2 emissions reduction and sustainable alkene production.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在组成和催化行为上有显著差异：

组成：Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者均以氧化铈为载体。

选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2选择性地进行CO2-ODHP（丙烷的氧化脱氢），生成丙烯。Ni3Pt1/CeO2选择性地进行DRP（丙烷的干重整），生成合成气。

稳定性：与Fe3Ni1/CeO2相比，Ni3Pt1/CeO2表现出更高的活性和稳定性。

反应机理：对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，CO2-ODHP途径涉及吸附的氧物种与CxHy片段反应形成含氧中间体。对于Ni3Pt1/CeO2，DRP途径可能涉及C-C键断裂形成合成气。

实验见解：原位XANES研究表明，两种催化剂都含有金属Ni，但Fe3Ni1/CeO2有氧化态Fe，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2有金属态Pt。

理论（DFT）见解：在Fe3Ni1/CeO2中，由于Fe-O键更强，Fe偏析到表面，促进CO2-ODHP。在Ni3Pt1/CeO2中，较高的Ni含量可能促进金属Ni粒子的形成，有利于DRP。

协同效应：两种催化剂的双金属性质与单金属催化剂相比提高了其性能，表明金属组分之间存在协同作用。

环境潜力：两种催化剂都提供了CO2利用和有价值产品形成（丙烯或合成气）的途径，有助于减少CO2排放和可持续烯烃生产。
