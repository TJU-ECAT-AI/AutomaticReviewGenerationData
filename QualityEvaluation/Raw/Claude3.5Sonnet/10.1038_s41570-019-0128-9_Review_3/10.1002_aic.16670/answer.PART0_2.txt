[1] "Among one of the key differences between CO2-ODHP and conventional oxidative dehydrogenation is the net reduction of CO2 and the production of CO from over-oxidation in CO2-ODHP, while the latter reaction only produces more CO2 upon over-oxidation."

[2] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was active and at steady state illustrated 2.6% and 1.1% CO2 and C3H8 conversion, respectively, with 32% and 65% C3H6 and CO selectivities, respectively."

[3] "Both Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."

[4] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[5] "Ni3Pt1 had previously been examined and it was determined that the catalyst under reaction conditions consisted of metallic Ni and Pt."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane.

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is composed of metallic Ni and Pt under reaction conditions.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows selectivity towards CO2-ODH, producing propylene (32% selectivity) and CO (65% selectivity). In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is selective for the DRP pathway, primarily producing syngas.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2.

Reaction mechanisms: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the presence of oxidized Fe favors oxidative C-H bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODH pathway. The metallic nature of both Ni and Pt in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 likely facilitates C-C bond breaking, leading to reforming products.

Synergistic effects: The bimetallic compositions show synergistic effects compared to their monometallic counterparts. The Fe-Ni interaction in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 creates a unique active site for CO2-ODH, while the Ni-Pt combination in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 enhances DRP activity and stability.

Environmental implications: Both catalysts offer potential for CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 produces valuable propylene while consuming CO2, addressing both alkene production and CO2 utilization. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 efficiently converts CO2 and propane to syngas, which can be used in various chemical processes.

These findings highlight the importance of catalyst composition and metal oxidation states in determining reaction pathways and product selectivity. The ability to tune catalysts for either CO2-ODH or DRP provides flexibility in addressing both chemical production needs and environmental concerns related to CO2 emissions.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在与丙烷进行CO2-ODH和DRP反应时，在组成、选择性和反应机理方面存在显著差异。

组成：在反应条件下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2由金属Ni和Pt组成。

选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2对CO2-ODH表现出选择性，产生丙烯（32%选择性）和CO（65%选择性）。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2选择性地进行DRP反应，主要产生合成气。

稳定性：Ni3Pt1/CeO2与Fe3Ni1/CeO2相比，表现出更高的活性和稳定性。

反应机理：对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，氧化Fe的存在有利于氧化性C-H键断裂，促进CO2-ODH途径。Ni3Pt1/CeO2中Ni和Pt的金属性质可能促进C-C键断裂，导致重整产物的生成。

协同效应：与单金属催化剂相比，双金属组成显示出协同效应。Fe3Ni1/CeO2中Fe-Ni的相互作用为CO2-ODH创造了独特的活性位点，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2中Ni-Pt的组合增强了DRP活性和稳定性。

环境影响：这两种催化剂都有潜力减少CO2排放。Fe3Ni1/CeO2在消耗CO2的同时生产有价值的丙烯，同时解决烯烃生产和CO2利用问题。Ni3Pt1/CeO2高效地将CO2和丙烷转化为合成气，可用于各种化学过程。

这些发现强调了催化剂组成和金属氧化态在决定反应途径和产物选择性方面的重要性。能够调节催化剂以进行CO2-ODH或DRP反应，为解决化学品生产需求和与CO2排放相关的环境问题提供了灵活性。
