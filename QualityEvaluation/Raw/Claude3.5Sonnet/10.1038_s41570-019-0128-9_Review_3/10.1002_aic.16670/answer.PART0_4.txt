[1] "Among the Pt and Pd based catalysts with Fe3, Co3, and Ni3 an improvement in both conversion and stability compared to the respective parent monometallics was observed for Co3Pd1, Co3Pt1, and Ni3Pt1, shown in Figure 1."

[2] "The previously reported Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[3] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[4] "The in situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

[5] "Ni3Pt1 had previously been examined and it was determined that the catalyst under reaction conditions consisted of metallic Ni and Pt."
