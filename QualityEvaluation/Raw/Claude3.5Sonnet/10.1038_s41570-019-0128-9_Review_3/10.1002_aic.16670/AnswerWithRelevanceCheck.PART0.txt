          [1] "The previously reported Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[2] "Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."

[3] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[4] "Ni3Pt1 had previously been examined and it was determined that the catalyst under reaction conditions consisted of metallic Ni and Pt."

[5] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a surface that contained a greater amount of Ni than Fe, it was inferred that metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced."

          Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is selective for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 favors DRP (dry reforming of propane).

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2.

Reaction mechanisms: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, oxidized Fe is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 likely operates via a different mechanism favoring C-C bond breaking for the DRP reaction.

Experimental insights: In-situ studies confirm the oxidation states of the metals under reaction conditions.

Theoretical (DFT) insights: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, Fe segregates to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding, promoting CO2-ODHP. In Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring DRP.

Environmental potential: Both catalysts offer pathways for CO2 utilization, contributing to CO2 emissions reduction and sustainable alkene or syngas production.

          Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机理方面存在显著差异：

组成：Fe3Ni1/CeO2由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2包含金属Ni和Pt。

选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2对CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）具有选择性，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2倾向于DRP（丙烷干重整）。

稳定性：Ni3Pt1/CeO2相比Fe3Ni1/CeO2表现出更高的活性和稳定性。

反应机理：对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，氧化Fe是通过CO2-ODHP途径favoring氧化C-H键断裂的关键。Ni3Pt1/CeO2可能通过不同的机理运作，倾向于DRP反应中的C-C键断裂。

实验见解：原位研究证实了反应条件下金属的氧化态。

理论（DFT）见解：对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，由于Fe-O键合更强，Fe向表面偏析，促进CO2-ODHP。在Ni3Pt1/CeO2中，较高的Ni含量可能促进金属Ni粒子的形成，有利于DRP。

环境潜力：两种催化剂都提供了CO2利用的途径，有助于减少CO2排放和可持续烯烃或合成气生产。
