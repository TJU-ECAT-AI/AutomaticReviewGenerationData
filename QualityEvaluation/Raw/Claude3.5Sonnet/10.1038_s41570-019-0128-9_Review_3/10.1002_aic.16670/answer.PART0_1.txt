[1] "Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[2] "Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."

[3] "The previously reported TGA weight loss of Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and the Co3Pt1 catalyst in this study lost 4%, see Figure S4. The extent of coking was similar after considering the different C3H8 conversions over the two catalysts."

[4] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[5] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a surface that contained a greater amount of Ni than Fe, it was inferred that metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is composed of non-precious metals and shows promising selectivity for the CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) reaction. Under reaction conditions, it consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. The presence of oxidized Fe is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage, which is key to the CO2-ODHP pathway.

In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains a precious metal (Pt) and is selective for the DRP (dry reforming of propane) reaction. It demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to other Pt-based catalysts. Under reaction conditions, both Ni and Pt remain in their metallic states.

Regarding stability, both catalysts experience some degree of coking, but the extent is similar when accounting for their different propane conversion rates. This suggests that both catalysts have comparable resistance to deactivation via carbon deposition.

DFT studies have provided insights into the synergistic effects in these bimetallic catalysts. For Fe3Ni1, the segregation of Fe to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding is crucial for its CO2-ODHP activity. However, when the Ni content is increased (as in Ni3Pt1), metallic Ni becomes more pronounced on the surface, favoring the DRP pathway.

These bimetallic catalysts show potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 offers a route to produce valuable propylene while consuming CO2, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 provides an efficient pathway for syngas production, which can be used in various industrial processes. Both catalysts contribute to CO2 utilization, addressing the need for carbon-neutral or carbon-negative technologies in the face of climate change.

双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在与丙烷进行CO2-ODH和DRP反应时，其组成、选择性和反应机理有显著差异。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2由非贵金属组成，对CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应显示出良好的选择性。在反应条件下，它由金属Ni和氧化Fe组成。氧化Fe的存在对于促进氧化性C-H键断裂至关重要，这是CO2-ODHP途径的关键。

相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有贵金属（Pt），对DRP（丙烷干重整）反应具有选择性。与其他基于Pt的催化剂相比，它表现出更高的活性和稳定性。在反应条件下，Ni和Pt都保持金属态。

关于稳定性，两种催化剂都会出现一定程度的结焦，但考虑到它们不同的丙烷转化率，结焦程度是相似的。这表明两种催化剂对碳沉积导致的失活都具有相当的抵抗力。

DFT研究为这些双金属催化剂的协同效应提供了见解。对于Fe3Ni1，由于Fe-O键合更强，Fe向表面偏析对其CO2-ODHP活性至关重要。然而，当Ni含量增加时（如Ni3Pt1），金属Ni在表面变得更加突出，有利于DRP途径。

这些双金属催化剂在全球烯烃生产和减少CO2排放的背景下，显示出环境友好催化的潜力。Fe3Ni1/CeO2提供了一种生产有价值的丙烯同时消耗CO2的途径，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2为合成气生产提供了一种高效途径，可用于各种工业过程。两种催化剂都有助于CO2利用，满足了面对气候变化时对碳中和或碳负技术的需求。
