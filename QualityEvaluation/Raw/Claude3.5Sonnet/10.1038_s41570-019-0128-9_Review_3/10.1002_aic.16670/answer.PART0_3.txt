[1] "The Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[2] "Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."

[3] "The previously reported TGA weight loss of Ni3Pt1 was 8%, and the Co3Pt1 catalyst in this study lost 4%, see Figure S4. The extent of coking was similar after considering the different C3H8 conversions over the two catalysts."

[4] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[5] "The in situ XANES results shown in Figure 10 revealed that like Fe3Ni1, the DRP Fe1Ni3 catalyst also consisted of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. Therefore, the selectivity differences among the various FexNiy catalysts were not caused by changes in oxidation state."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane.

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of iron and nickel on a ceria support, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum on ceria.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is selective towards CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), producing propylene. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 favors the DRP (dry reforming of propane) pathway, primarily generating synthesis gas.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. Both catalysts experience some coking, but the extent is comparable when accounting for different propane conversion rates.

Reaction mechanisms: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is crucial for favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. This was supported by DFT calculations. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, operates via a different mechanism favoring C-C bond breaking for the DRP reaction.

Synergistic effects: Both catalysts exhibit synergistic effects between their constituent metals. For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, the interaction between oxidized Fe and metallic Ni is key to its CO2-ODHP selectivity. In Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the combination of Ni and Pt enhances activity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts.

These catalysts show potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 offers a route to produce valuable propylene while consuming CO2, addressing both chemical feedstock needs and greenhouse gas reduction. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, while not producing alkenes directly, generates synthesis gas which can be used in various chemical processes, also while consuming CO2.

The insights gained from these experimental and theoretical studies highlight the importance of metal oxidation states, atomic ratios, and bimetallic interactions in determining catalyst performance and selectivity. This understanding can guide future catalyst design for more efficient and selective CO2 utilization processes.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在组成、选择性、稳定性和丙烷CO2-ODH及DRP反应机理方面存在显著差异。

组成：Fe3Ni1/CeO2由铁和镍组成，负载在氧化铈支撑体上，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2包含镍和铂，同样负载在氧化铈上。

选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2对CO2-ODHP（丙烷氧化脱氢）反应具有选择性，生成丙烯。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2倾向于DRP（丙烷干重整）路径，主要生成合成气。

稳定性：Ni3Pt1/CeO2表现出比Fe3Ni1/CeO2更高的活性和稳定性。两种催化剂都会发生一定程度的积碳，但考虑到不同的丙烷转化率，积碳程度是可比的。

反应机理：对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，反应条件下氧化铁的存在对于CO2-ODHP路径中氧化C-H键断裂至关重要。这一点得到了DFT计算的支持。而Ni3Pt1/CeO2则通过不同的机理运作，倾向于DRP反应中的C-C键断裂。

协同效应：两种催化剂都展现了组成金属之间的协同效应。对于Fe3Ni1/CeO2，氧化铁和金属镍之间的相互作用是其CO2-ODHP选择性的关键。在Ni3Pt1/CeO2中，镍和铂的组合相比单金属催化剂提高了活性和稳定性。

这些催化剂在全球烯烃生产和CO2减排背景下显示出环境友好催化的潜力。Fe3Ni1/CeO2提供了一种生产有价值的丙烯同时消耗CO2的途径，既满足了化学原料需求，又减少了温室气体排放。Ni3Pt1/CeO2虽然不直接生产烯烃，但生成的合成气可用于各种化学过程，同时也消耗CO2。

从这些实验和理论研究中获得的见解强调了金属氧化态、原子比例和双金属相互作用在决定催化剂性能和选择性方面的重要性。这种理解可以指导未来更高效、更具选择性的CO2利用过程的催化剂设计。
