Abstract
The activity, selectivity and stability of RhrC catalysts prepared from nitrate precursor on three different active carbon
supports was determined in ethene hydroformylation. The different active carbon supports yielded catalysts, which had

.
different extents of reduction 62–94% and dispersion 4–27% after hydrogen reduction. The best activity and selectivity
Ž .
in the formation of propanal was obtained with the coconut shell based RhrC C catalyst, presumably due to the better
Ž .
metal dispersion and the presence of unreduced Rh sites. Furthermore, without any pretreatment, the RhrC C catalyst
exhibited even higher activity and better propanal yields than its hydrogen treated counterpart. Most likely, the active sites
remained better dispersed in the absence of pretreatment than after hydrogen reduction, and it was the well-dispersed sites
that were active in the formation of propanal. High temperature CO pretreatment partially blocked the catalyst surface with
carbonaceous residues, which improved propanal selectivity, but suppressed the overall activity. Thus, the right choice of
pretreatment appears to be a key factor in providing an active and selective catalyst for heterogeneous hydroformylation. It
should also be noted that the catalysts lost 10–30% of the metal deposited on the support during 24 h on stream. q 1999

hydrogen adsorption, to promote strong or mul-
tiple adsorption of CO and to inhibit dissocia-
w
x
tive CO adsorption 14 . These special charac-
teristics of active carbon are also important for
hydroformylation, which is governed by molec-
ular reaction of CO.
On supported catalysts, the reaction sequence
involving CO insertion and subsequent hydro-
genation has been found to be much faster than
the competing reaction route consisting of CO
dissociation and hydrogenation of the surface
w x
carbon species 2 . However, when considering
the nature of the active sites, the literature data
is controversial. In some studies, the CO inser-
tion selectivity is related exclusively to the lin-
0
w
x
early adsorbed CO on isolated Rh sites 15,16 .
Other studies show that reaction rate and selec-
tivity for hydroformylation is increased in the
presence of Rhq sites, and that the reduced Rh
crystallites are highly active for the hydrogena-
w
x
tion of ethene 17 . Moreover, the hydroformy-
lation of ethene is regarded as structure sensi-
tive, and the hydrogenation of ethene structure
w
x
insensitive 15 . Accordingly, the insertion se-
lectivity has been enhanced by partial blockage
w
x
18 or selective poisoning of the active sites
w
x
19,20 . In regard to the more precise size of the
w
x
active site, Arakawa et al. 21 have reported
that a Rh particle size below approximately 3
Ž
nm is advantageous for hydroformylation the
.
number of edge and corner atoms is increased ,
and ethane formation is at a maximum with a
Rh particle size of around 4 nm. Thus, the
results clearly show that high dispersion, or
small particle size, is of the utmost importance
for hydroformylation activity.
In the case of Rh on active carbon, the
particle size of the active metal and the selectiv-
ity of the catalyst, have been greatly influenced
by the choice of the support as shown in our
previous work concerning methanol hydrocar-
w
x
bonylation 22 . Our previous studies have also
indicated that the particle size can be affected
w
x
by the pretreatment of the catalyst
23 . For
Ž
.
example, the decarbonylation of Rh CO
r
4
12
SiO
in a CO atmosphere instead of hydrogen
2
appeared to decrease the particle size. Conse-
quently, the selectivity of the catalyst to oxy-
genates in CO hydrogenation was significantly
increased. A similar positive effect of CO treat-
ment on propanal selectivity has also been no-
ticed on RhrC catalyst in ethene hydroformyla-
w
x
tion 11 . Therefore, both the characteristics of
the support and the method of pretreatment of
the supported precursor might have a profound
effect on the activity and selectivity of the
RhrC catalyst in a structure sensitive reaction,
such as ethene hydroformylation.
In this work, the performance of the RhrC
catalysts was studied in the gas phase hydro-
formylation of ethene, with the hope of enhanc-
ing the heterogeneous functionality of the cata-
lysts already observed in the liquid phase hydro-
w
x
formylation of 1-hexene 24 . The aim was to
elucidate the effect of the active carbon support
on the catalytic activity of rhodium in connec-
tion with different pretreatment conditions. In
addition, we determined the stability of the cata-
lysts since experimental evidence regarding the
stability of the heterogeneous catalysts in hydro-
formylation under flow conditions is still scarce

Three different activated carbon supports
were used for the preparation of 5 wt.% RhrC

rasagi, and C C for coconut shell based acti-
vated carbon from Johnson Matthey. The sup-
ports were impregnated with rhodium nitrate as
a catalyst precursor. The catalysts were calci-
nated under nitrogen flow at 4008C for 3 h. The
details of the preparation are presented in more

2.2. Catalyst characterisation
The catalysts were characterised by TPR, H 2
and CO chemisorption, XPS and TEM. The
metal contents of the catalysts were determined
before and after the reaction by AAS. The
details of the preparation and characterisation of
the activated carbon supported RhrC catalysts
w
x
have already been reported in detail 26 , except
for support analysis, SEM and TPR, which will
be presented in this paper.
The potassium contents of the supports were
determined by flame AAS using a Varian Spec-
trAA-600 with O rC H -flame. Prior to analy-

flushed with argon at 1108C for 30 min and
cooled down to 308C. The samples were heated
from 30 to 4008C at a rate of 108Crmin, and
kept at 4008C for 1 h under a flow of 10 vol.%

tion remains constant over the temperature range
studied. The extent of reduction determined in
this way might not be the absolute value, but it
allows a comparison of the reducibility of the
RhrC catalysts. The TCD curve was fitted by 4
Gaussian curves to obtain the area under each
curve, and thereby the hydrogen consumption
was related to each peak.
2.3. Ethene hydroformylation
The ethene hydroformylation was carried out
in an automated fixed bed tubular reactor
Ži.d.s12 mm, pocket for the thermocouples:

1738C, using a 1:2:2:2 molar ratio of Ar:CO:

and GHSV of approximately 800–

900rh. The catalyst, 1 or 0.5 g approximately
3.
2.6 or 1.3 cm , was diluted with glass beads in
a 1:1 volume ratio. In general, isothermal condi-
tions were maintained, i.e., the control point
temperatures inside the pocket for the thermo-
couples, which was placed in the catalyst bed
typically remained within "0.58C in respect to
the setpoint value, and the vertical temperature
gradient of the catalyst bed was within "18C in
respect to the setpoint value. However, in some
Ž .
cases, the initial activity of the RhrC C
and
Ž .
RhrC T
catalysts was too high to maintain
isothermal conditions; the automatic cooling
system of the reactor forced the reaction tem-
perature to the setpoint value, and the vertical
temperature gradient of the catalyst bed was
within "48C in respect to the setpoint value.
Therefore, we repeated some of the experiments
with 0.5 g of catalyst, using the same GHSV as
previously.
The product analysis was carried out on-line
using two HP 5890 Gas Chromatographs one
equipped with a DB-1 from J&W Scientific and
PoraplotQ from Hewlett Packard, and the other
one with a packed column filled with activated
carbon coated with 2% squalane. The response

27
were used in
quantitative
determinations.
The
data
was
recorded for 24 h and the steady-state conver-
sion and selectivities were calculated as an aver-
age of last 5–6 h. Conversion, selectivities and
yields were calculated based on the ethene con-
sumed.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterisations
The hydrogen consumption in TPR measure-
ments, together with water and methane forma-
tion, were determined as a function of tempera-
ture for RhrC catalysts in order to estimate the
reducibility of the catalysts. The results are
presented in Figs. 1–3. The hydrogen consump-
tion during TPR below 2508C was mainly due
Ž
.
to the formation of water Fig. 2 , whereas at
temperatures higher than 2508C, the formation
Ž
.
of methane predominated
Fig. 3 . Since the
determination of water and methane was not
quantitative, the extents of reduction were eval-
uated from hydrogen consumption. Since it is
only the hydrogen consumption for the forma-
tion of water that should be accounted for when
considering the reduction of the Rh species, the
estimation of the extents of reduction had to be
limited to 2508C.
The first peak maximum for hydrogen con-
sumption was at 85–908C, equivalent to an
extent of reduction of 29, 12 and 8% for

formation was due to the rhodium catalysed

hour and, simultaneously, the propanal yield
increased from almost zero to the steady-state

level, as illustrated in Fig. 5 for RhrC T . In
the steady state, the main products formed were
ethane and propanal. In addition, minor amounts
of side products were observed. The side prod-
ucts were mainly C
aldols, i.e., condensation

products of two propanal molecules, such as
2-methyl-2-pentenal and 2-methyl-1-pentanal,
but small amounts of propanol and 3-pentanone,
and in some cases propylformate and propylpro-
pionate, were also detected.
In addition to the changes in the activity for
ethane and propanal formation during the first
hours on stream, there were differences between
the catalysts depending on the support. The best
selectivity with regard to the desired product,
propanal, i.e., the best activity for CO insertion
and subsequent hydrogenation, was obtained
Ž .
with the RhrC C
catalyst. The propanalr

ethane molar ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which
is a surprisingly high selectivity for a nonmodi-

Rh sites 17 , i.e., both the valency and the size

reduction, the TPR results indicated that the

reducibility of RhrC T was lower compared to

RhrC C or RhrC N . In addition, a previous
study has indicated that the near-surface extent

As described above, the size of the metal
particles is of utmost importance for the hydro-
formylation activity. The determination of parti-

biguous because hydrogen treatments induce ag-

RhrC T , the Rh species were evenly dis-
tributed with an average particle size of 2–7

Together, the XPS, TEM and chemisorption
results indicate that after hydrogen reduction,
Ž .
Ž .
both
RhrC C
and
RhrC T
have
sites
favourable for hydroformylation, i.e., partially
reduced rhodium sites which are small enough
in size. As a result, both the catalysts exhibit
high yields in hydroformylation, but the signifi-
Ž .
cantly higher selectivity of RhrC C
towards
propanal still remains unexplained. The low ac-
Ž .
tivity of RhrC N
in hydroformylation is in
agreement with the characterisations: the very
Ž .
small particles present on RhrC N were fully
reduced, being thereby less active in hydro-
formylation and more active in hydrogenation.
Moreover, the considerably lower overall activ-
Ž .
ity of RhrC N
is explained by the low total
Ž
.
hydrogen uptake Table 2 .
Under the reaction conditions, surface recon-
struction occurs and thus both the extent of
reduction and particle size may be significantly
altered during the course of the reaction. Indeed,
the reactivity results also lend support to this
view since the activity and selectivity were
drastically altered during the first hours of the
reaction. Therefore, the used catalysts were
studied by SEM to see the effect of different
pretreatments on the particle size of the metal.
Unfortunately, the particle size distributions of
the catalysts could not be determined accurately
enough, although the resolution of the equip-
ment on hand was good—the sizes of the small-
Ž
.
est particles
-10 nm
were too small to be
detected. Nevertheless, another very interesting
finding was made: the SEM determinations sug-
gested that KCl particles were present on the
Ž .
RhrC C
catalyst, but not on the other two
catalysts. Perhaps, unintentional KCl promotion
was the cause of the superior selectivity—a
possibility deserving more detailed considera-
tion.

31 .
Fortunately, some relevant studies are available

was not formed, the amounts of C
oxygenates

were only slightly increased on RhrC C cata-
lyst, and the conversion level of the catalyst was
not suppressed, the effect of potassium was
most probably not profound. However, it is
possible that the potassium present slightly im-
Ž .
proved propanal yields on RhrC C compared
to the other supports.
When the potassium contents of the plain

3.3. The performance of RhrC in the absence
of pretreatment
The RhrC catalysts were also tested in the
absence of pretreatment in order to shed light on
the debate as to whether Rh0 or Rhq is the
active site for hydroformylation. The number of
Rhq sites would be expected to be higher with-
out any reductive pretreatment, due to lower
extents of reduction. Furthermore, the hydrogen
reduction has been shown to induce agglomera-
w
x
tion of rhodium on carbon 22 and, therefore,
higher dispersion might be another benefit ob-
tained by omitting the pretreatment.
Ž .
As expected, the RhrC C catalyst was more
active than its hydrogen reduced counterpart
Ž
.
when the pretreatment was omitted see Fig. 4 .
The propanal yield increased from 12 to 14%,
which was the best propanal yield achieved with
our catalysts, although the propanalrethane ra-
tio changed slightly from 1.1 to 1.0. This in-
creased activity may in part be explained by
better dispersion since Rh catalysed gasification
of the carbon support might have been responsi-
ble for the agglomeration of Rh during hydro-
Ž .
gen pretreatment in the case of RhrC C , as
Ž
discussed in connection with TPR results see
.
also Fig. 3 . However, the higher activity was
probably also influenced by the extent of reduc-
tion, which remains lower in the absence of
Ž
reduction than after hydrogen treatment
see
.
also Table 1 . Based on the TPR results, it
seems apparent that part of the rhodium species
were probably reduced to metal during the first
hours under synthesis gas flow. Moreover, the
results from
hydrogen chemisorption deter-
mined after reduction at 1758C also support the
idea of higher dispersion without high-tempera-

Ds27% due to the lower extent of
reduction of the catalyst. Thus, the high activity
Ž .
of RhrC C
catalyst without pretreatment is
explained by the better dispersed metal, and the
existence of unreduced Rh sites active in hydro-
formylation.
Ž .
In contrast to the performance of RhrC C ,
Ž .
Ž .
the overall activity of RhrC T and RhrC N
catalysts decreased slightly when the pretreat-
Ž .
ment was omitted. For RhrC T , the decrease
Ž .
in conversion was 2.5% units and for RhrC N
it was 4.5% units. The propanalrethane ratios
Ž
.
remained the same for both
pres0.7 . Per-
Ž .
Ž .
haps, in the case of RhrC N and RhrC T , the
omission of the pretreatment had a less restric-
tive effect on agglomeration since much less
hydrogasification was observed on these two
catalysts, i.e., the formation of methane during
Ž .
TPR was clearly lower than on RhrC C . In
(

regard to the extent of reduction, it seems ap-
parent that the extent of reduction was lower
after omitting the pretreatment than after hydro-
gen reduction. Thus, one would expect higher
reactivity, but nevertheless the hydroformyla-
Ž .
Ž .
tion yields of RhrC T and RhrC N were not
improved.
The changes in the product distribution with
time on stream followed a similar trend to that
observed in the experiments with hydrogen re-
duction; the ethane formation predominated in
the beginning. The decrease in overall activity
was due to a decrease in ethane conversion, i.e.,
apparently, the amount of active sites for ethane
formation decreased during the reaction. Consis-
w
x
tently, Mori et al. 40 have reported that the
active site for ethane production might be dif-
ferent from that for propanal production.
3.4. The performance of RhrC after CO pre-
treatment
The performance of the RhrC was also stud-
ied with CO pretreatment, which has previously
been found to significantly enhance the oxy-
genate yield on RhrSiO
in CO hydrogenation
2
w
x
via partial blockage of the active sites
23 .
Such a partial blockage effect should also be
beneficial for hydroformylation catalysts. Oth-
ers have claimed that CO treatment provides
w
x
high dispersion
41 —another desired feature
for hydroformylation.
Ž
.
For the CO treated catalysts 4008C, 1 h , the
Ž
.
activity was significantly lower only 5% than
Ž
.
for the ones after hydrogen reduction 12–28%
Ž
.
see Fig. 4 . Thus, the high temperature treat-
ment with CO probably blocked the catalyst
surface with coke as observed previously for
w
x
RhrSiO
23 . Due to this major decrease in
2
activity, the CO pretreatment was also carried
Ž
.
out at lower temperature
1758C , and indeed
the conversion decrease was only 5% for
Ž .
RhrC T . Evidently, the choice of temperature
is critical when considering CO pretreatment of
the catalyst surface.
As a result of the high temperature CO treat-
ment,
the
selectivity
towards
propanal
in-
creased, and this increase was highest on the
Ž .
RhrC C catalyst, which was also initially the
most selective towards propanal. Therefore, the
high temperature treatment with CO probably
partially blocked the catalyst surface with coke,
and thereby increased the amount of CO inser-
tion sites compared to hydrogenation sites. Af-
ter low temperature pretreatment, however, the
aldehyde promotion was almost negligible. Ap-
parently, the pretreatment temperature was so
low that the carbonaceous deposits formed were
reactive, and no permanent blockage of the
w
x
catalyst surface occurred 42 .
3.5. Stability of the catalysts
Our previous studies with 1-hexene hydro-
formylation showed that metal losses occurred
w
x
during the liquid-phase reaction 24 , and we
assumed that the stability of the catalysts would
be improved under less severe reaction condi-
tions. Indeed, under gas phase conditions, the
Ž .
metal losses were less than 10% for RhrC N ,
Ž .
Ž .
whereas for RhrC T and RhrC C , they were
Ž
.
Ž .
20–30% see Table 3 . Thus, the RhrC C and
Ž .
RhrC T
catalysts active in the formation of
propanal lost more metal than the less active

RhrC N . Consistently, under the reaction con-
ditions, the supported Rh species might form
volatile carbonyls which are transported away
from the support with the product flow. To
confirm this assumption, we performed a test on
Ž .
Ž
RhrC C in the absence of CO ethene hydro-
.
genation : the losses were only 8%. Thus, most
of the losses are due to the action of CO on Rh.
4. Conclusions
The RhrC catalysts were tested in gas phase
ethene hydroformylation reaction to elucidate
the effect of support characteristics and pretreat-
ments on hydroformylation activity.
After hydrogen reduction, the three active
carbon supported catalysts under study had dif-
Ž
.
ferent extents of reduction 62–94% and dis-
Ž
.
persion 8–15% , but all catalysts were never-
theless active in hydroformylation. The best se-
lectivity towards the desired product, propanal,
was obtained with the coconut shell based
Ž .
RhrC C catalyst. The propanalrethane molar
Ž .
ratio was 1.1 for RhrC C , which is a surpris-
ingly high selectivity for a nonmodified Rh
catalyst under these conditions—a result due to
the characteristics of the active carbon support
and, possibly, to the unintentional promotion by
KCl.
In the absence of pretreatment, the perfor-
Ž .
mance of RhrC C was superior to its hydrogen
treated counterpart. Most likely, the rhodium
Ž .
species on the RhrC C catalyst remained more
well dispersed in the absence of pretreatment
than in conjunction with hydrogen reduction
since the undesired Rh catalysed hydrogasifica-
Ž .
tion of the C C
support was eliminated. In
Ž .
addition, the extent of reduction for RhrC C
was presumably lower after omitting the pre-
treatment, i.e., the number of unreduced Rh
sites favourable for hydroformylation was in-
creased. However, the activity of the other two
catalysts decreased slightly without pretreatment
—a result due partly to the less profound hydro-
Ž .
gasification effect in connection with RhrC T

and RhrC N .

produced no benefits. Thus, the right
choice of pretreatment appears to be a key
factor in providing an active and selective cata-
lyst for heterogeneous hydroformylation.
In summary, the support characterististics and
the different pretreatments had an influence on
the dispersion and the extent of reduction, and
thereby on the activity and selectivity of the
catalysts. Highly dispersed catalysts were essen-
tial for hydroformylation activity, and small
amount of unreduced Rh was favourable for
propanal formation. A more detailed interpreta-
tion of the interrelation between the character-
istics and reactivity would require in situ char-
acterisation techniques since the catalyst surface
reconstructs during reaction. In addition, marked
improvements are required in the catalyst com-

position to avoid the losses
