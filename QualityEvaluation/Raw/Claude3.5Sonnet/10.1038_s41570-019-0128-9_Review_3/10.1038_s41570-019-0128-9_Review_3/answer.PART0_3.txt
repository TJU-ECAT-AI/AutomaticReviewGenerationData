[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively"

[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."

[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms"

[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."

[5] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts that show promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Their compositions differ, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 containing iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

In terms of selectivity, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates 58% selectivity for propylene (C3H6) in CO2-ODH reactions, with good stability. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, is highly selective (96%) for CO production in DRP reactions.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH scission, which is characteristic of CO2-ODH reactions, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 promotes CC scission, typical of DRP reactions. This difference in mechanism is supported by DFT calculations.

Experimental studies reveal that the metal components in these catalysts exist in different oxidation states. In Fe3Ni1/CeO2, nickel is present as Ni0, while iron exists in oxidized forms. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, both nickel and platinum are present in their metallic states (Ni0 and Pt0).

The bimetallic nature of these catalysts contributes to their enhanced performance. Synergistic effects between iron and nickel in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 result in higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to the monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe).

These catalysts show potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. They utilize less toxic metals compared to previously examined oxide catalysts, addressing concerns about catalyst toxicity and instability. Their ability to selectively produce valuable alkenes while consuming CO2 aligns with the goal of reducing net anthropogenic CO2 emissions while meeting the demand for alkene production.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2是在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中表现出良好性能的双金属催化剂。它们的成分不同，Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者都以氧化铈为载体。

在选择性方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性为58%，且具有良好的稳定性。而Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO的生成具有很高的选择性（96%）。

这两种催化剂的反应机理不同。Fe3Ni1/CeO2倾向于CH键断裂，这是CO2-ODH反应的特征，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2促进CC键断裂，这是DRP反应的典型特征。DFT计算结果支持了这种机理上的差异。

实验研究表明，这些催化剂中的金属组分存在不同的氧化态。在Fe3Ni1/CeO2中，镍以Ni0形式存在，而铁以氧化态存在。对于Ni3Pt1/CeO2，镍和铂都以金属态（Ni0和Pt0）存在。

这些催化剂的双金属性质contributes了它们的增强性能。Fe3Ni1/CeO2中铁和镍的协同作用使得丙烯产率（1.6%）高于单金属催化剂（镍为0.4%，铁为0.2%）。

这些催化剂在全球烯烃生产和CO2减排背景下显示出环境友好催化的潜力。与之前研究的氧化物催化剂相比，它们使用毒性较低的金属，解决了催化剂毒性和不稳定性的问题。它们能够选择性地生产有价值的烯烃，同时消耗CO2，这与减少人为CO2净排放量同时满足烯烃生产需求的目标相一致。
