          [1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively"

[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."

[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms"

[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."

[5] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."

          Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts that show promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Their compositions differ, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 containing iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

In terms of selectivity, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propylene (C3H6) in CO2-ODH reactions, with good stability. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, is highly selective (96%) for CO production in DRP reactions.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH scission, which is characteristic of CO2-ODH reactions, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 promotes CC scission, typical of DRP reactions. This difference in mechanism is supported by DFT calculations.

Experimental studies, including in situ XANES measurements, revealed that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains metallic platinum (Pt0), while both catalysts contain metallic nickel (Ni0). However, iron in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, which may contribute to its CO2-ODH activity.

Synergistic effects between the metals in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 were observed, with the bimetallic catalyst showing higher C3H6 yields (1.6%) compared to the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe).

These catalysts show potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in particular, demonstrates promise for CO2-ODH reactions, which could contribute to the production of valuable alkenes while consuming CO2. The use of non-precious metals like iron and nickel in these catalysts also aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems.

          Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2是在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中表现出色的双金属催化剂。它们的组成不同，Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者均以氧化铈为载体。

在选择性方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性为58%，并表现出良好的稳定性。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO的选择性高达96%。

这两种催化剂的反应机理不同。Fe3Ni1/CeO2倾向于CH键断裂，这是CO2-ODH反应的特征，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2促进CC键断裂，这是DRP反应的典型特征。DFT计算支持了这种机理上的差异。

实验研究，包括原位XANES测量，揭示了Ni3Pt/CeO2含有金属态铂（Pt0），而两种催化剂都含有金属态镍（Ni0）。然而，Fe3Ni/CeO2中的铁以氧化态存在，这可能有助于其CO2-ODH活性。

Fe3Ni/CeO2中金属间的协同效应得到了观察，双金属催化剂的C3H6产率（1.6%）高于各自的单金属催化剂（Ni为0.4%，Fe为0.2%）。

这些催化剂在全球烯烃生产和CO2减排的背景下显示出环境友好催化的潜力。特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中表现出良好的前景，可能有助于生产有价值的烯烃，同时消耗CO2。在这些催化剂中使用铁和镍等非贵金属也符合开发更可持续和经济高效的催化系统的目标。
