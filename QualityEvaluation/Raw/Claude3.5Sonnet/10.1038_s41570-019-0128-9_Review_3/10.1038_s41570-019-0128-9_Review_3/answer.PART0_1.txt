[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively"

[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."

[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms"

[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."

[5] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts that show promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Their composition differs, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 containing iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

In terms of selectivity, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propylene (C3H6) in CO2-ODH reactions, demonstrating good stability. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, is highly selective for CO production (96%) in DRP reactions.

Experimental studies, including in situ XANES measurements, reveal that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains metallic platinum (Pt0), while both catalysts contain metallic nickel (Ni0). However, iron in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, which may contribute to its CO2-ODH activity.

DFT calculations suggest that both Fe3Ni and FeONi systems energetically favor CH scission (associated with CO2-ODH) over CC scission (associated with DRP). In contrast, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt surfaces are predicted to favor CC scission, explaining its high activity in DRP reactions.

Synergistic effects between the metals in Fe3Ni/CeO2 are evident from experiments showing higher C3H6 yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%) catalysts. This synergy contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness in CO2-ODH reactions.

These findings highlight the potential of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni1/CeO2, for environmentally benign CO2-ODH processes. By utilizing CO2 and light alkanes to produce valuable alkenes, these catalysts offer a promising approach to reducing net CO2 emissions while contributing to global alkene production. The combination of experimental and theoretical studies provides crucial insights into the performance and mechanisms of these catalysts, paving the way for further optimization and development of selective, stable, and efficient catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2是在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中表现出色的双金属催化剂。它们的组成不同，Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者均以氧化铈为载体。

在选择性方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性为58%，并表现出良好的稳定性。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO的选择性高达96%。

实验研究，包括原位XANES测量，揭示了Ni3Pt/CeO2含有金属态铂（Pt0），而两种催化剂都含有金属态镍（Ni0）。然而，Fe3Ni/CeO2中的铁以氧化态存在，这可能有助于其CO2-ODH活性。

DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni和FeONi系统在能量上更倾向于CH断裂（与CO2-ODH相关）而非CC断裂（与DRP相关）。相反，铂终止的Ni3Pt表面预计会倾向于CC断裂，解释了其在DRP反应中的高活性。

Fe3Ni/CeO2中金属间的协同效应从实验中得到证实，其C3H6产率（1.6%）高于单金属Ni（0.4%）和Fe（0.2%）催化剂。这种协同作用有助于催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的效果。

这些发现突显了双金属催化剂，特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2，在环境友好的CO2-ODH过程中的潜力。通过利用CO2和轻烷烃生产有价值的烯烃，这些催化剂为减少净CO2排放同时贡献全球烯烃生产提供了一种有前景的方法。实验和理论研究的结合为这些催化剂的性能和机理提供了关键见解，为进一步优化和开发CO2-ODH反应的选择性、稳定性和高效催化剂铺平了道路。
