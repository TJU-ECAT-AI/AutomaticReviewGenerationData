[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively"

[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."

[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms"

[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."

[5] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts that show promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Their composition differs in that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 contains iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

In terms of selectivity, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propylene (C3H6) in CO2-ODH reactions, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 shows 96% selectivity for CO in DRP reactions. Both catalysts demonstrate good stability under reaction conditions.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH scission, which is characteristic of CO2-ODH reactions, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 promotes CC scission, typical of DRP reactions. This difference in mechanism is supported by DFT calculations.

Experimental studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 contains oxidized iron species and metallic nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 features metallic platinum and nickel. These differences in oxidation states contribute to their distinct catalytic behaviors.

Synergistic effects are observed in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, as the bimetallic catalyst shows higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to the monometallic Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%) catalysts. This synergy between iron and nickel enhances the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODH reactions.

These catalysts represent progress towards environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in particular, shows promise for CO2-ODH reactions, which can potentially contribute to reducing net CO2 emissions while producing valuable alkenes. The use of non-precious metals (Fe, Ni) in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 also aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable catalytic systems.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2是两种双金属催化剂，分别在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中表现出良好的性能。它们的组成不同，Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者都以氧化铈为载体。

在选择性方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性为58%，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO的选择性为96%。两种催化剂在反应条件下都表现出良好的稳定性。

这两种催化剂的反应机理不同。Fe3Ni1/CeO2倾向于CH键断裂，这是CO2-ODH反应的特征，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2促进CC键断裂，这是DRP反应的典型特征。DFT计算支持了这种机理上的差异。

实验研究表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有氧化态的铁物种和金属态的镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2则含有金属态的铂和镍。这些氧化态的差异导致了它们不同的催化行为。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2展现出协同效应，双金属催化剂的丙烯产率（1.6%）高于单金属Ni（0.4%）和Fe（0.2%）催化剂。铁和镍之间的这种协同作用增强了催化剂在CO2-ODH反应中的性能。

这些催化剂代表了全球烯烃生产和CO2减排环境友好催化的进展。特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中显示出潜力，可能有助于减少净CO2排放，同时生产有价值的烯烃。Fe3Ni1/CeO2使用非贵金属（Fe，Ni）也符合开发更可持续催化系统的目标。
