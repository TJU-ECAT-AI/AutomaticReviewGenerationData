[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8)."

[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."

[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe and FeO groups under reaction conditions102."

[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."

[5] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts that show promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Their compositions differ, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 containing iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

In terms of selectivity, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propylene (C3H6) in CO2-ODH reactions, with good stability. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, is highly selective for CO (96%) in DRP reactions.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH scission, which is characteristic of CO2-ODH reactions, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 promotes CC scission, typical of DRP reactions.

Experimental studies, including in situ XANES and EXAFS measurements, revealed that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains metallic platinum (Pt0), while both catalysts contain metallic nickel (Ni0). However, iron in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, such as FeOFe and FeO groups.

DFT calculations supported these findings, showing that Fe3Ni(111) and FeONi(111) interfaces energetically favor CH scission, while Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) favors CC scission.

The synergistic effect between the metals in these bimetallic catalysts is evident, particularly in Fe3Ni/CeO2, where the propylene yield (1.6%) is significantly higher than that of the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe).

These catalysts show potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in particular, demonstrates promise for CO2-ODH reactions, which could contribute to the production of valuable alkenes while consuming CO2. The use of non-precious metals like iron and nickel in these catalysts also aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2是在与丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中表现出良好性能的双金属催化剂。它们的成分不同，Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者都以氧化铈为载体。

在选择性方面，Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中对丙烯（C3H6）的选择性为58%，并具有良好的稳定性。而Ni3Pt1/CeO2在DRP反应中对CO的选择性很高（96%）。

这两种催化剂的反应机理不同。Fe3Ni1/CeO2倾向于CH断裂，这是CO2-ODH反应的特征，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2促进CC断裂，这是DRP反应的典型特征。

实验研究，包括原位XANES和EXAFS测量，揭示了Ni3Pt/CeO2含有金属铂（Pt0），而两种催化剂都含有金属镍（Ni0）。然而，Fe3Ni/CeO2中的铁以氧化形式存在，如FeOFe和FeO基团。

DFT计算支持了这些发现，显示Fe3Ni(111)和FeONi(111)界面在能量上有利于CH断裂，而Pt终止的Ni3Pt(111)有利于CC断裂。

这些双金属催化剂中金属之间的协同效应很明显，特别是在Fe3Ni/CeO2中，其丙烯产率（1.6%）明显高于各自的单金属催化剂（Ni为0.4%，Fe为0.2%）。

这些催化剂在全球烯烃生产和CO2减排的背景下显示出环境友好催化的潜力。特别是Fe3Ni1/CeO2在CO2-ODH反应中表现出良好的前景，这可能有助于生产有价值的烯烃，同时消耗CO2。在这些催化剂中使用铁和镍等非贵金属也符合开发更可持续和经济高效的催化系统的目标。
