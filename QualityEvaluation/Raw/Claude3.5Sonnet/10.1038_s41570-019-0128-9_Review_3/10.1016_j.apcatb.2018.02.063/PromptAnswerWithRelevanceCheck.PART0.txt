Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, and what insights can be gained from experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies regarding their performance, synergistic effects, and potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide any information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The document only mentions NiFe bimetallic catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming of n-butane with CO2. There is insufficient information to compare the catalysts or discuss their composition, selectivity, stability, reaction mechanisms, or potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

The given literature does not contain any information specifically about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts or their comparison in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The document appears to be only a title and author list for a paper on oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming of n-butane with CO2 over NiFe bimetallic catalysts. Without access to the full text, it is not possible to answer the detailed questions about catalyst composition, selectivity, stability, reaction mechanisms, experimental and theoretical studies, or potential applications.
