Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

How do the bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 compare in terms of their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, and what insights can be gained from experimental and theoretical (DFT) studies regarding their performance, synergistic effects, and potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts or their performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane. The document primarily discusses vanadium oxide catalysts supported on MSU-1 for the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. It does not mention the specific bimetallic catalysts or reactions asked about in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献中不包含有关Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂或它们在丙烷的CO2-ODH和DRP反应中的性能的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了以MSU-1为载体的钒氧化物催化剂用于CO2存在下的异丁烷脱氢反应。它没有提到问题中询问的特定双金属催化剂或反应。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。

The text primarily discusses vanadium oxide catalysts supported on MSU-1 for isobutane dehydrogenation with CO2. There is no data provided to compare the composition, selectivity, stability or reaction mechanisms of the bimetallic catalysts mentioned in the question. The document also does not contain any DFT studies or discussions on global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction in relation to these specific catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中不包含任何关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂或它们在丙烷CO2-ODH和DRP反应中性能的信息。该文本主要讨论了负载在MSU-1上的钒氧化物催化剂用于异丁烷与CO2的脱氢反应。文中没有提供任何数据来比较问题中提到的双金属催化剂的组成、选择性、稳定性或反应机理。该文件也不包含任何DFT研究或关于这些特定催化剂在全球烯烃生产和CO2减排方面的讨论。因此,仅基于给定文献中提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。
