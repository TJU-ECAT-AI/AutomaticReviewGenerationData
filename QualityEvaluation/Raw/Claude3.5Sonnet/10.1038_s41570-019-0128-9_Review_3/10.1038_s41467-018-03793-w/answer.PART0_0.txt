[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."

[2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3"

[4] "The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane. On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4b on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the pathway for the CC bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CH bond."

[5] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 contains iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on ceria. Under reaction conditions, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized iron and metallic nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic nickel and platinum.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows promising selectivity towards propylene (58.2%) via the CO2-ODHP pathway. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is highly selective towards CO (88%) via the DRP pathway.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3, while the stability of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is not explicitly compared.

Reaction mechanisms: DFT calculations reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. Conversely, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 favors CC bond cleavage, facilitating the dry reforming pathway.

These catalysts demonstrate synergistic effects, as the bimetallic systems outperform their monometallic counterparts. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows potential for environmentally benign catalysis by promoting propylene production while consuming CO2. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, while not directly producing alkenes, contributes to CO2 emissions reduction through the dry reforming of propane.

These findings provide valuable insights into the design of catalysts for global alkene production and CO2 utilization, offering pathways to address both the growing demand for propylene and the need to mitigate CO2 emissions.

双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在CO2-ODH和DRP与丙烷反应中的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机理方面存在显著差异：

组成：Fe3Ni1/CeO2含有铁和镍，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有镍和铂，两者均以氧化铈为载体。在反应条件下，Fe3Ni1/CeO2由氧化态铁和金属态镍组成，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2包含金属态镍和铂。

选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2通过CO2-ODHP途径对丙烯表现出良好的选择性（58.2%）。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2通过DRP途径对CO具有高选择性（88%）。

稳定性：与单金属Ni3相比，Ni3Pt1/CeO2表现出更好的稳定性，而Fe3Ni1/CeO2的稳定性未明确比较。

反应机理：DFT计算表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2倾向于CH键断裂，促进氧化脱氢途径。相反，Ni3Pt1/CeO2倾向于CC键断裂，有利于干重整途径。

这些催化剂展现了协同效应，双金属系统的性能优于单金属系统。Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂通过促进丙烯生产同时消耗CO2，显示出环境友好催化的潜力。Ni3Pt1/CeO2催化剂虽然不直接生产烯烃，但通过丙烷干重整contributes to CO2减排。

这些发现为全球烯烃生产和CO2利用催化剂的设计提供了宝贵见解，为解决日益增长的丙烯需求和减少CO2排放提供了途径。
