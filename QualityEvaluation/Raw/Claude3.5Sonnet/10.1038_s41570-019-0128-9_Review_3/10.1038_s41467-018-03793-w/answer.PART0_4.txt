[1] "Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[2] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3 (Supplementary Fig. 3)."

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "Overall the DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

[5] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Pt and Ni.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via CO2-ODHP. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88%) towards CO.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3, while Fe3Ni1/CeO2's stability is not explicitly mentioned but appears to be steady-state.

Reaction mechanisms: DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway.

Experimental and theoretical studies provide several insights:

1. Synergistic effects: The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields compared to monometallic counterparts.

2. Structure-function relationship: The oxidation states of metals play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance, with oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 promoting CO2-ODHP.

3. Potential for environmentally benign catalysis: Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2 utilization in propane conversion, potentially addressing the global propylene production gap while consuming greenhouse gases.
