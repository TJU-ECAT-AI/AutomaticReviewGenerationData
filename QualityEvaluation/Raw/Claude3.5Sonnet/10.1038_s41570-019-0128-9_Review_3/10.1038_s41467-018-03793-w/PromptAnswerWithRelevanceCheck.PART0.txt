<quotes>

[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."

[2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3"

[4] "The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane. On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4b on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the pathway for the CC bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CH bond."

[5] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 contains iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on ceria. Under reaction conditions, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized iron and metallic nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic nickel and platinum.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows promising selectivity towards propylene (58.2%) via the CO2-ODHP pathway. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is highly selective towards CO (88%) via the DRP pathway.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3, while the stability of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is not explicitly compared.

Reaction mechanisms: DFT calculations reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. Conversely, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 favors CC bond cleavage, facilitating the dry reforming pathway.

These catalysts demonstrate synergistic effects, as the bimetallic systems outperform their monometallic counterparts. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows potential for environmentally benign catalysis by promoting propylene production while consuming CO2. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst, while not directly producing alkenes, contributes to CO2 emissions reduction through the dry reforming of propane.

These findings provide valuable insights into the design of catalysts for global alkene production and CO2 utilization, offering pathways to address both the growing demand for propylene and the need to mitigate CO2 emissions.
