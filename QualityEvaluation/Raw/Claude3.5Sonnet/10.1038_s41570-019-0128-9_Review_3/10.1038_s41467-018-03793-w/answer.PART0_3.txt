The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms:

Composition:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni supported on CeO2, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt on CeO2.

Selectivity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is selective towards propylene production via CO2-ODHP, with 58.2% C3H6 selectivity. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP, showing 88% selectivity towards CO.

Stability:
Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher stability compared to monometallic Ni3, while Fe3Ni1/CeO2's stability is not explicitly mentioned but appears to maintain steady-state performance.

Reaction mechanisms:
DFT calculations suggest that Fe3Ni favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway.

Insights from experimental and theoretical studies:
1. Synergistic effects: The formation of bimetallic catalysts enhances their performance compared to monometallic counterparts.
2. Environmental impact: Both catalysts offer potential for CO2 utilization, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 producing valuable propylene and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 generating syngas.
3. Structure-function relationship: The oxidation state and composition of the metals significantly influence the catalyst's behavior and selectivity.

These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly catalysts for alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction in the context of global petrochemical needs.
