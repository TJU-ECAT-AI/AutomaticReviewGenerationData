[1] "Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[2] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3 (Supplementary Fig. 3)."

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "Overall the DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

[5] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Pt and Ni.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is selective for propylene production (58.2% C3H6 selectivity) via the CO2-ODHP pathway. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs the DRP reaction with high selectivity toward CO (88%).

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher stability compared to monometallic Ni3.

Reaction mechanisms: DFT calculations reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway.

Experimental and theoretical studies provide several insights:

1. Synergistic effects: The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, yielding higher propylene production compared to its monometallic counterparts.

2. Structure-function relationships: The oxidation states of metals and surface structures play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance and selectivity.

3. Reaction pathways: DFT calculations help elucidate the preferred reaction pathways on different catalyst surfaces, providing a theoretical basis for experimental observations.

These findings contribute to the development of environmentally benign catalysis for global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for CO2-ODHP, potentially addressing the propylene production gap while consuming CO2. The Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrates potential for syngas production via DRP, offering an alternative route for CO2 utilization.
