[1] "Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[2] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3 (Supplementary Fig. 3)."

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "Overall the DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

[5] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 show distinct compositions, selectivities, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

1. Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Pt and Ni.

2. Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates 58.2% selectivity towards propylene (C3H6) in the CO2-ODHP reaction. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 shows 88% selectivity towards CO in the DRP reaction.

3. Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3.

4. Reaction mechanisms: DFT calculations reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, favoring the DRP pathway.

5. Synergistic effects: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yield (1.6%) compared to monometallic Ni (0.4%) and Fe (0.2%) catalysts.

These findings provide insights into the potential of bimetallic catalysts for environmentally benign catalysis. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows promise for propylene production, addressing the global alkene demand, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 is effective for syngas production. Both catalysts utilize CO2 as a reactant, contributing to CO2 emissions reduction. The study demonstrates the importance of catalyst design in achieving desired selectivity and stability for specific reaction pathways in the context of sustainable chemical production.
