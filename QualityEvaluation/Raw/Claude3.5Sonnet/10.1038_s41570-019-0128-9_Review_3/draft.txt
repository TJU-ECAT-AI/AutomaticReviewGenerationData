Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have emerged as promising systems for CO2-ODH (oxidative dehydrogenation) and DRP (dry reforming of propane) reactions with propane, respectively. These catalysts exhibit distinct compositions, selectivities, stabilities, and reaction mechanisms, which have been elucidated through a combination of experimental and theoretical studies.

Composition and Structure:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe supported on CeO2, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt on the same support [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In situ XANES measurements confirmed that under reaction conditions, Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, whereas both catalysts contain metallic Ni (Ni0) [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3]. The presence of oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 plays a crucial role in its catalytic performance.

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88-96%) towards CO production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3]. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 also exhibits higher CO2 conversion (39%) compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

Stability:
Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates superior stability compared to monometallic Ni3 and other precious metal bimetallic catalysts with Fe3 and Co3 [10.1002/aic.16670]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 also shows good stability, maintaining steady-state performance in CO2-ODH reactions [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3].

Reaction Mechanisms:
DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. On bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111), the pathway for oxidative CH bond cleavage has a lower energy than CC bond scission [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. Conversely, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway. On Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage pathway has a lower energy than CH bond breaking [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

Synergistic Effects:
The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to its monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%) [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This synergy is attributed to the unique interaction between metallic Ni and oxidized Fe species.

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations reveal that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 segregates to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O [10.1002/aic.16670]. This surface segregation of oxidized Fe is key to promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes the formation of metallic Ni particles, which favors the DRP reaction.

Environmental Implications:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates potential for CO2-ODH reactions, contributing to the production of valuable alkenes while consuming CO2. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, provides an efficient pathway for syngas production through DRP.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The comparative study of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts offers valuable insights into the design of efficient bimetallic systems for CO2 utilization in propane conversion. The distinct performances of these catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions highlight the importance of metal combination, oxidation states, and surface structure in determining catalytic behavior.

Future research directions may include:

1. Exploring novel bimetallic combinations and support materials to further enhance selectivity and stability in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.
2. Investigating the potential of these catalysts for other alkane substrates, expanding their applicability in the petrochemical industry.
3. Developing in-operando characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions.
4. Integrating machine learning approaches with DFT calculations to accelerate the discovery of optimal catalyst compositions and structures.
5. Scaling up these catalytic systems for industrial applications, addressing challenges in catalyst synthesis, reactor design, and process optimization.

By building upon the fundamental understanding gained from these studies, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes for CO2 utilization and valuable chemical production, contributing to the broader goals of carbon neutrality and circular economy in the chemical industry.
