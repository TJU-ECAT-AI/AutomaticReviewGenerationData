Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are promising bimetallic catalysts for CO2-ODH (oxidative dehydrogenation) and DRP (dry reforming) of propane, respectively. These catalysts exhibit distinct compositions, selectivities, stabilities, and reaction mechanisms, which have been elucidated through experimental and theoretical studies.

Composition and Structure:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt, both supported on CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In situ XANES measurements confirmed that under reaction conditions, Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, while Ni in both catalysts and Pt in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 remain in their metallic states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3].

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 demonstrates promising selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs the DRP reaction with high selectivity (88-96%) towards CO production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3].

Stability:
Ni3Pt1/CeO2 exhibits higher activity and stability compared to monometallic Ni3 and other precious metal counterparts with Fe3 and Co3 [10.1002/aic.16670]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 also demonstrates good stability, maintaining steady-state performance [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3].

Reaction Mechanisms:
DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1002/aic.16670].

Synergistic Effects:
The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrates a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%) [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This synergy is attributed to the unique combination of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe in the catalyst.

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations show that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe segregates to the surface of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O [10.1002/aic.16670]. This surface segregation plays a crucial role in promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring the DRP reaction.

Environmental Implications:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in particular, demonstrates potential for CO2-ODH reactions, which could contribute to the production of valuable alkenes while consuming CO2.

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts reveals the critical role of composition, structure, and reaction conditions in determining catalyst performance for CO2 utilization reactions. Future research directions may include:

1. Catalyst design optimization: Fine-tuning the metal ratios and oxidation states to enhance selectivity and stability.
2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Utilizing advanced in situ characterization techniques to further elucidate the reaction pathways and active sites.
3. Scalability and industrial application: Investigating the feasibility of scaling up these catalytic systems for industrial propylene production and CO2 mitigation.
4. Novel bimetallic combinations: Exploring other transition metal combinations to develop more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP reactions.
5. Computational screening: Employing machine learning and high-throughput computational methods to predict and design new bimetallic catalysts with improved performance.

These advancements could pave the way for more sustainable and economically viable processes in the chemical industry, addressing both the growing demand for alkenes and the urgent need for CO2 emissions reduction.

This synergy highlights the importance of carefully designed bimetallic systems in enhancing catalytic performance.

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations reveal that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe segregates to the surface of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O. However, on surfaces with a higher Ni content, metallic Ni particles are more pronounced [10.1002/aic.16670].

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt, both supported on CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In situ XANES measurements confirmed that under reaction conditions, Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, while Ni in both catalysts and Pt in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 remain in their metallic states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3].

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, with good stability [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88-96%) towards CO production and demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9_3].

Reaction Mechanisms:
DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1002/aic.16670].

Synergistic Effects:
The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%) [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This synergy is attributed to the unique composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst.

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations revealed that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe segregates to the surface of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O, promoting CO2-ODHP [10.1002/aic.16670]. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring the DRP reaction.

Environmental Potential:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

The synergistic effects observed in these catalysts, particularly in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggest that further exploration of bimetallic compositions could lead to even more efficient catalytic systems. Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Investigating other bimetallic combinations, potentially incorporating earth-abundant metals, to optimize catalytic performance and reduce reliance on precious metals.
