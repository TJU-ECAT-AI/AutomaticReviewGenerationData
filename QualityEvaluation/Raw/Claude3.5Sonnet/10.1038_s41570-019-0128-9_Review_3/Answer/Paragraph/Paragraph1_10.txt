This paragraph explores the comparative analysis of two bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2, in their performance, mechanisms, and characteristics for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) and dry reforming of propane (DRP) reactions. The study combines experimental and theoretical approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of these catalysts' behavior. By examining their activity, selectivity, and stability in both reactions, researchers aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to their effectiveness. The investigation delves into the synergistic effects between the metal components and the CeO2 support, as well as the role of each element in the catalytic process. Additionally, the study explores how the different compositions of these bimetallic catalysts influence their surface properties, redox capabilities, and resistance to coking. Through this analysis, the research seeks to identify the key factors that determine the superior performance of one catalyst over the other in specific reaction conditions, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for propane conversion.
