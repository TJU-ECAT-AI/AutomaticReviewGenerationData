The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have shown promising performance in CO2-ODH (oxidative dehydrogenation) and DRP (dry reforming of propane) reactions with propane, respectively. These catalysts differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms, offering unique insights into the development of efficient catalytic systems for propane conversion and CO2 utilization.

Composition and Structure:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt, both supported on CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In situ XANES measurements confirmed that under reaction conditions, Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, while Ni in both catalysts and Pt in Ni3Pt1/CeO2 remain in their metallic states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, with good stability [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88-96%) towards CO production and demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].

Reaction Mechanisms:
DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1002/aic.16670].

Synergistic Effects:
The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%) [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This synergy is attributed to the unique composition and structure of the bimetallic catalyst.

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations revealed that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe segregates to the surface of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O, promoting CO2-ODHP [10.1002/aic.16670]. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring the DRP reaction.

Environmental Potential:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts provides valuable insights into the design of efficient bimetallic systems for propane conversion and CO2 utilization. The synergistic effects observed in these catalysts, particularly in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggest that further exploration of bimetallic compositions could lead to even more efficient catalytic systems. Future research efforts might focus on:

1. Investigating other bimetallic combinations, potentially incorporating earth-abundant metals, to optimize catalytic performance and reduce reliance on precious metals.

2. Developing in-depth understanding of the surface dynamics and metal-support interactions under reaction conditions, which could guide the design of more stable and selective catalysts.

3. Exploring the potential for scaling up these catalytic systems for industrial applications, addressing challenges related to catalyst stability, regeneration, and long-term performance.

4. Integrating these catalysts into broader CO2 utilization strategies, potentially coupling propane conversion with other CO2 reduction processes to maximize environmental benefits.

5. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling to further elucidate the atomic-scale mechanisms governing catalyst performance, enabling more precise catalyst design and optimization.

These future directions could contribute significantly to the development of more sustainable and efficient processes for alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction, addressing critical challenges in the chemical industry and environmental protection.

The distinct performance of these catalysts in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions highlights the importance of tailoring catalyst composition and structure to achieve desired selectivity and stability.

Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Optimizing the ratio of metal components in bimetallic catalysts to enhance synergistic effects and improve catalytic performance.

2. Investigating the role of the support material (CeO2) in stabilizing the active metal species and its potential participation in the reaction mechanism.

3. Exploring the possibility of designing multi-functional catalysts that can perform both CO2-ODH and DRP reactions efficiently, allowing for tunable product distribution based on reaction conditions.

By addressing these research directions, we can further advance the development of efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for CO2 utilization, contributing to the global efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing valuable chemicals from waste carbon dioxide.
