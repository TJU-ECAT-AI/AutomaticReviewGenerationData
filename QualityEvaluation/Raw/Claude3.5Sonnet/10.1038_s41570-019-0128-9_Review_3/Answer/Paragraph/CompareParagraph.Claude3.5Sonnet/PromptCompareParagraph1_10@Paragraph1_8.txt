This paragraph explores the comparative analysis of two bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2, in their performance, mechanisms, and characteristics for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) and dry reforming of propane (DRP) reactions. The study combines experimental and theoretical approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of these catalysts' behavior. By examining their activity, selectivity, and stability in both reactions, researchers aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that contribute to their effectiveness. The investigation delves into the synergistic effects between the metal components and the CeO2 support, as well as the role of each element in the catalytic process. Additionally, the study explores how the different compositions of these bimetallic catalysts influence their surface properties, redox capabilities, and resistance to coking. Through this analysis, the research seeks to identify the key factors that determine the superior performance of one catalyst over the other in specific reaction conditions, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for propane conversion.

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have shown promising performance in CO2-ODH (oxidative dehydrogenation) and DRP (dry reforming) reactions with propane, respectively. These catalysts differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms.

Composition and Structure:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt, both supported on CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In situ XANES measurements confirmed that under reaction conditions, Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, while Ni is present as Ni0 in both catalysts. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 features metallic Pt (Pt0) [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, with good stability [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88-96%) towards CO production and demonstrates 39% CO2 conversion [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].

Stability:
Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3 and other precious metal catalysts with Fe3 and Co3 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1002/aic.16670]. The stability of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is not explicitly mentioned but appears to maintain steady-state performance.

Reaction Mechanisms:
DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), the pathway for oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for CC bond scission. Conversely, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway. On Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the pathway for CC bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for CH bond breaking [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

Synergistic Effects:
The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%) [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3]. This indicates that the two elements operate synergistically in the bimetallic catalyst.

Structure-Function Relationship:
The oxidation states of metals play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1002/aic.16670]. DFT calculations show that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe segregates to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O, promoting CO2-ODHP [10.1002/aic.16670].

Environmental Potential:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3]. The use of non-precious metals like iron and nickel in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts provides valuable insights into the design of efficient bimetallic catalysts for CO2 utilization in propane conversion. The synergistic effects observed in these catalysts, particularly in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, suggest that further exploration of bimetallic combinations could lead to even more effective catalysts. Future research might focus on:

1. Optimizing metal ratios and support materials to enhance selectivity and stability.
2. Investigating the potential of other transition metal combinations to achieve similar or superior performance without relying on precious metals.
3. Developing in-operando characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic behavior of these catalysts under reaction conditions.
4. Exploring the scalability and long-term stability of these catalysts for industrial applications.
5. Investigating the potential of these catalysts for other alkane feedstocks or related reactions.

By building on these findings, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for CO2 utilization, potentially addressing both the global propylene production gap and greenhouse gas emissions reduction simultaneously.
