Comparative analysis of bimetallic catalysts' performance, mechanisms, and characteristics in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane: An experimental and theoretical study focusing on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 have shown promising performance in CO2-ODH (oxidative dehydrogenation) and DRP (dry reforming of propane) reactions with propane, respectively [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3]. These catalysts differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms, offering unique insights into the design of efficient catalysts for propane conversion and CO2 utilization.

Composition and Structure:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Pt and Ni, both supported on CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In-situ XANES measurements confirmed that under reaction conditions, Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, while Ni remains metallic. For Ni3Pt1/CeO2, both Ni and Pt are present in their metallic states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88%) towards CO production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst demonstrates a C3H6 yield of 1.6%, significantly higher than its monometallic counterparts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating a synergistic effect between Fe and Ni [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].

Stability:
Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3 catalysts [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The stability of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is not explicitly mentioned, but it appears to maintain steady-state performance [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

Reaction Mechanisms:
DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. On the other hand, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1002/aic.16670].

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations show that in the presence of oxygen (from CO2 dissociation), Fe segregates to the surface of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 due to stronger Fe-O bonding compared to Ni-O. However, on surfaces with higher Ni content, metallic Ni particles are more pronounced [10.1002/aic.16670]. This surface segregation phenomenon plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic behavior of these bimetallic systems.

Environmental Potential:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The use of non-precious metals like iron and nickel in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The comparative study of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts provides valuable insights into the design principles for efficient bimetallic catalysts in CO2 utilization reactions. The synergistic effects observed in these systems, particularly in Fe3Ni1/CeO2, open up new avenues for catalyst design. Future research efforts could focus on:

1. Exploring other bimetallic combinations, potentially incorporating earth-abundant metals, to further enhance catalytic performance and sustainability.
2. Investigating the role of the support material (CeO2) in these reactions and exploring alternative supports to optimize catalyst performance.
3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition under reaction conditions.
4. Scaling up these catalytic systems for potential industrial applications, addressing challenges in catalyst stability and regeneration.
5. Integrating computational modeling with high-throughput experimental screening to accelerate the discovery of novel, high-performance catalysts for CO2 utilization.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic processes for propane conversion and CO2 utilization, contributing to the broader goals of sustainable chemical production and greenhouse gas mitigation.

In situ XANES measurements have confirmed these oxidation states under reaction conditions, revealing that Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, while both catalysts contain metallic Ni (Ni0) [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3]. The presence of oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 plays a crucial role in its catalytic activity for CO2-ODH reactions [10.1002/aic.16670].

Selectivity and Activity:
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, demonstrating good stability [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP reactions with high selectivity (88-96%) towards CO production [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3] [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 also shows higher CO2 conversion (39%) compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

Stability:
Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3 catalysts [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The stability of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is not explicitly mentioned but appears to maintain steady-state performance [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

The presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway for Fe3Ni1/CeO2 [10.1002/aic.16670].

Synergistic Effects:
The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%) [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. This synergy is attributed to the unique interaction between Fe and Ni in the bimetallic system.

Theoretical Insights:
DFT calculations have provided valuable insights into the surface chemistry of these catalysts. For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, Fe segregates to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding in the presence of oxygen from CO2 dissociation, promoting CO2-ODHP [10.1002/aic.16670]. In Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring DRP reactions [10.1002/aic.16670].

Environmental Potential:
Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in particular, demonstrates potential for CO2-ODH reactions, which could contribute to the production of valuable alkenes while consuming CO2 [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9\_3].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The comparative analysis of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 catalysts reveals the intricate relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions. These findings pave the way for future research directions in the field of propane dehydrogenation and CO2 utilization:

1. Catalyst design optimization: Further exploration of bimetallic compositions and ratios could lead to catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. The synergistic effects observed in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 suggest that other bimetallic combinations might offer improved performance.

2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Advanced in situ characterization techniques, coupled with computational modeling, could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the role of each metal in the catalytic process. This understanding could guide the rational design of next-generation catalysts.

3. Scalability and industrial application: Future research should focus on scaling up these catalytic systems and evaluating their performance under industrial conditions. This includes addressing challenges related to catalyst lifetime, regeneration, and process integration.

4. Sustainable catalyst development: The use of non-precious metals in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable catalytic systems. Future efforts could explore other earth-abundant elements to create environmentally friendly and economically viable catalysts.

5. Integrated CO2 utilization processes: Developing integrated systems that combine CO2 capture with catalytic conversion could maximize the environmental benefits of these catalysts. This approach could contribute to closing the carbon cycle in industrial processes.

By addressing these research directions, the scientific community can work towards more efficient and sustainable solutions for propane conversion and CO2 utilization, potentially revolutionizing the chemical industry and contributing to global efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
