          [1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."

[2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3"

[4] "The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane. On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4b on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the pathway for the CC bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CH bond."

[5] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[6] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."

          The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Pt and Ni, both supported on CeO2.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via CO2-ODHP. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88%) towards CO.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3, while Fe3Ni1/CeO2's stability is not explicitly mentioned but appears to maintain steady-state performance.

Reaction mechanisms: DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway.

Experimental and theoretical studies provide several insights:

1. Synergistic effects: The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%).

2. Structure-function relationship: The oxidation states of metals play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance, with oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 promoting CO2-ODHP.

3. Potential for environmentally benign catalysis: Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2 utilization in propane conversion, potentially addressing the global propylene production gap while consuming greenhouse gases.

          双金属催化剂Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Ni3Pt1/CeO2在CO2-ODH和DRP与丙烷反应中的组成、选择性、稳定性和反应机理方面存在显著差异：

组成：Fe3Ni1/CeO2由氧化铁和金属镍组成，而Ni3Pt1/CeO2含有金属铂和镍，两者均以CeO2为载体。

选择性：Fe3Ni1/CeO2通过CO2-ODHP对丙烯生产表现出高选择性（58.2%）。相比之下，Ni3Pt1/CeO2主要进行DRP反应，对CO具有高选择性（88%）。

稳定性：Ni3Pt1/CeO2相比单金属Ni3表现出更好的稳定性，而Fe3Ni1/CeO2的稳定性虽未明确提及，但似乎能保持稳态性能。

反应机理：DFT研究表明，Fe3Ni1/CeO2倾向于CH键断裂，促进CO2-ODHP途径。而Ni3Pt1/CeO2则偏好CC键断裂，有利于DRP途径。

实验和理论研究提供了几点见解：

1. 协同效应：双金属Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂表现出协同效应，丙烯产率（1.6%）高于单金属对应物（Ni：0.4%，Fe：0.2%）。

2. 结构-功能关系：金属的氧化态在决定催化性能中起着关键作用，Fe3Ni1/CeO2中的氧化铁促进CO2-ODHP。

3. 环境友好催化潜力：两种催化剂都为CO2利用提供了有前景的途径，无论是通过CO2-ODHP（Fe3Ni1/CeO2）还是DRP（Ni3Pt1/CeO2），都能应对全球烯烃生产和CO2减排的关切。

这些发现有助于开发更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，用于丙烷转化中的CO2利用，有潜力解决全球丙烯生产缺口问题，同时消耗温室气体。
