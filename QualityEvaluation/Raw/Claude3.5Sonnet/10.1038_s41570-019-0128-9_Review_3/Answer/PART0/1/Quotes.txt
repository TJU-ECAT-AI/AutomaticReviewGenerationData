[1] "The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively"

[2] "Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO."

[3] "According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms"

[4] "The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111)."

[5] "Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically."

[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas Ni3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."

[2] "The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity."

[3] "The other precious metal bimetallic catalyst, Ni3Pt, primarily performs the DRP reaction with 39% CO2 conversion, a robust selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions (Supplementary Table 2) and is more stable compared to monometallic Ni3"

[4] "The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane. On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4b on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the pathway for the CC bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CH bond."

[5] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[6] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."

[1] "The previously reported Fe3Ni1 catalyst was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."

[2] "Ni3Pt1 and Ni3Pd1 were DRP catalysts and demonstrated higher activity and stability than the Pt and Pd counterparts with Fe3 and Co3."

[3] "Under reaction conditions the Fe3Ni1 catalyst had also been previously determined to consist of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe. This finding was incorporated into DFT calculations in the previous study and it was determined that the presence of oxidized Fe under reaction conditions was key to favor oxidative C-H bond cleavage via the CO2-ODHP pathway."

[4] "Ni3Pt1 had previously been examined and it was determined that the catalyst under reaction conditions consisted of metallic Ni and Pt."

[5] "From the previous DFT calculations, it was also observed that in the presence of oxygen (from the dissociation of CO2), Fe segregated to the surface due to a stronger Fe-O bond compared to Ni-O. However, on a surface that contained a greater amount of Ni than Fe, it was inferred that metallic Ni particles would be more pronounced."
