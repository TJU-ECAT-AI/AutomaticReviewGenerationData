Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 are bimetallic catalysts that show promising performance in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane, respectively. Their compositions differ, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 containing iron and nickel, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains nickel and platinum, both supported on cerium oxide.

In terms of selectivity, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% selectivity for propylene (C3H6) in CO2-ODH reactions, with good stability. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, is highly selective (96%) for CO production in DRP reactions.

The reaction mechanisms differ between the two catalysts. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH scission, which is characteristic of CO2-ODH reactions, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 promotes CC scission, typical of DRP reactions. This difference in mechanism is supported by DFT calculations.

Experimental studies, including in situ XANES measurements, revealed that Ni3Pt/CeO2 contains metallic platinum (Pt0), while both catalysts contain metallic nickel (Ni0). However, iron in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms, which may contribute to its CO2-ODH activity.

Synergistic effects between the metals in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 were observed, with the bimetallic catalyst showing higher C3H6 yields (1.6%) compared to the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe).

These catalysts show potential for environmentally benign catalysis in the context of global alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction. Fe3Ni1/CeO2, in particular, demonstrates promise for CO2-ODH reactions, which could contribute to the production of valuable alkenes while consuming CO2. The use of non-precious metals like iron and nickel in these catalysts also aligns with the goal of developing more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems.

The bimetallic catalysts Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms in CO2-ODH and DRP reactions with propane:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Pt and Ni, both supported on CeO2.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows high selectivity (58.2%) towards propylene production via CO2-ODHP. In contrast, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 primarily performs DRP with high selectivity (88%) towards CO.

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates better stability compared to monometallic Ni3, while Fe3Ni1/CeO2's stability is not explicitly mentioned but appears to maintain steady-state performance.

Reaction mechanisms: DFT studies reveal that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favors CH bond cleavage, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway. Ni3Pt1/CeO2, on the other hand, prefers CC bond cleavage, facilitating the DRP pathway.

Experimental and theoretical studies provide several insights:

1. Synergistic effects: The bimetallic Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst shows a synergistic effect, with higher propylene yields (1.6%) compared to monometallic counterparts (Ni: 0.4%, Fe: 0.2%).

2. Structure-function relationship: The oxidation states of metals play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance, with oxidized Fe in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 promoting CO2-ODHP.

3. Potential for environmentally benign catalysis: Both catalysts offer promising routes for CO2 utilization, either through CO2-ODHP (Fe3Ni1/CeO2) or DRP (Ni3Pt1/CeO2), addressing global concerns of alkene production and CO2 emissions reduction.

These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for CO2 utilization in propane conversion, potentially addressing the global propylene production gap while consuming greenhouse gases.

Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 differ significantly in their composition, selectivity, stability, and reaction mechanisms:

Composition: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 consists of metallic Ni and oxidized Fe, while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 contains metallic Ni and Pt.

Selectivity: Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is selective for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane), while Ni3Pt1/CeO2 favors DRP (dry reforming of propane).

Stability: Ni3Pt1/CeO2 demonstrates higher activity and stability compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2.

Reaction mechanisms: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, oxidized Fe is key to favoring oxidative C-H bond cleavage in the CO2-ODHP pathway. Ni3Pt1/CeO2 likely operates via a different mechanism favoring C-C bond breaking for the DRP reaction.

Experimental insights: In-situ studies confirm the oxidation states of the metals under reaction conditions.

Theoretical (DFT) insights: For Fe3Ni1/CeO2, Fe segregates to the surface due to stronger Fe-O bonding, promoting CO2-ODHP. In Ni3Pt1/CeO2, the higher Ni content likely promotes metallic Ni particle formation, favoring DRP.

Environmental potential: Both catalysts offer pathways for CO2 utilization, contributing to CO2 emissions reduction and sustainable alkene or syngas production.
