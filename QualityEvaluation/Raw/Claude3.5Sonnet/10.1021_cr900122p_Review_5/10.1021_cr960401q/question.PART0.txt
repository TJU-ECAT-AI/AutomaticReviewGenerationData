I. Characteristics of Heteropoly Compounds for Solid Catalysts
Heteropoly compounds provide a good basis for the molecular design of mixed oxide catalysts and they have high capability in practical uses. This is because the relationships among the following four levels of information can be established on the molecular basis: (i) catalytic performance; (ii) chemical and physical property; (iii) molecular and bulk composition and structure; and (iv) method of synthesis of catalyst. We assume that these relationships are most useful for the design of practical catalysts. 1-5
The catalytic function of heteropoly compounds has attracted much attention particularly in the last two decades. They are used in solution as well as in the solid state as acid and oxidation catalysts. The reason why heteropoly catalysts are attractive is their variety and high potential as catalyst. The advantageous characteristics are listed in Table 1 (cf. refs 1 and 2 for more detailed information).

Systematic research of heterogeneous catalysis that started in the mid-1970s has disclosed the presence of quantitative relationships between the acid or redox properties and catalytic performance of heteropoly catalysts as well as their unique behavior in heterogeneous catalysis such as pseudoliquid-phase (bulk-type (I)) and the bulk-type (II) catalysis. 1-11
There are already several industrial processes which utilize heteropoly catalysts. 1,12 Many known and new heteropoly compounds are being applied to a wide variety of reactions. The newest commercial process, the direct oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid catalyzed by palladium plus HPAs, will start by the end of 1997 in Japan (100000 ton/year). It is evident that the research activity of heteropoly catalysis is very high and still growing.
In this article, we attempted to avoid the overlapping with our previous review,1 but the minimum fundamental aspects are given to provide a sound overview about the present subject. The term heteropoly compounds (HPAs) is used for the hydrogen (or acid) forms and the salts. HPAs can be utilized for precursors of oxide catalysts, but this will not be included in this review. The present review focuses mostly on the Keggin HPAs, as there have been rather few systematic studies on the heterogeneous catalysis of well-characterized HPAs other than the Keggin HPAs.
II. Structure of Heteropoly Compounds in the Solid State
A. Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Structures
It is very important, in our view, for understanding the heterogeneous catalysis of HPAs to distinguishbetween the two classes of structures which we call the primary and the secondary structures.1,2,4,13 As a reference to the differences, 12-tungstophosphoric acid is shown in Figure 1. 14,15 HPAs in the solid state are ionic crystals (sometimes amorphous) consisting of large polyanions (primary structure), cations, water of crystallization, and other molecules. This three-dimensional arrangement is the secondary structure.
Figure 1 Primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of HPAs: (a) primary structure (Keggin structure, PW12O40), (b) secondary structure (H3PW12O40·6H2O), and (c) tertiary structure.
Recently, it was realized that, in addition to these two structures, the tertiary structure is very influential on the catalytic function of solid HPAs.1,2 The tertiary structure is the structure of solid HPAs as assembled. The size of the particles, pore structure, distribution of protons in the particle, etc., are the elements of the tertiary structure. Thus, HPAs in the solid bulk have hierarchic structures. Countercations greatly influence the tertiary structure of HPAs, and the salts are classified by the size of cation into group A (small metal ions like Na and Cu) and group B (large metal ions like Cs, NH4, etc.). 16
The location of the protons in dehydrated H3PW12O40 is controversial. The IR spectrum of H3PW12O40·6H2O showed broad bands at 29003600 and 15001800 cm-1 due to ν(H+(H2O)2) and δ (H+ (H2O)2), respectively, 17-20 and both bands disappeared by the evacuation at elevated temperatures.20 Although there is no reliable explanation for the disappearance by evacuation even at 423 K, it is possible that protons are only weakly bound and mobile, giving a very diffuse band. We observed that there were significant differences in the shifts of the ν(WOeW) bands (Oe, edge-shared oxygen) during the dehydration process of H3PW12O40·6H2O and D3PW12O40·6D2O and indicated that the protons migrate from the terminal oxygen onto the bridging oxygen upon dehydration above 373 K. 21 Kozhevnikov et al. suggested that protons are located at terminal oxygens (hopping around?) on the basis of the 60 ppm upfield shift of the 17O NMR signal of terminal oxygen upon the dehydration of H3PW12O40·nH2O at 473 K. 22
The relative intensities of four 31P NMR peaks for CsxH3-xPW12O40 (x = 03) demonstrated that all protons of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 are distributed nearly uniformly through the solid bulk. 2,23 In other words, they are solid solutions of H3PW12O40 and Cs3PW12O40. In addition, the same 31P NMR spectrum was observed when the sample was prepared by impregnating H3PW12O40 on Cs3PW12O40 to form the same average composition. Hence, it is certain that homogenization proceeds by the migration of Cs ion and proton.2,23-25 On the other hand, Essayem et al. suggested on the basis of 31P NMR and XRD data, which were prepared in a slightly different way, that hydrogen cesium salt corresponds to Cs3PW12O40 with a highly dispersed H3PW12O40 entrapped in the pores. 26
In many cases, the primary structure in solution is maintained as confirmed by XRD, IR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopies after solid HPAs are obtained by the evaporation to dryness or by precipitation. Figure 1a shows the PW12O403- Keggin structure. The preservation of the primary structure in the solid state is shown for most of the other cases, too. There are four different kinds of oxygen. Figure 1b shows the secondary structure of its hydrogen form in hexahydrate state, which was confirmed by neutron diffraction. 27 In this case, the PW12O403- polyanions are bridged by hydrated protons, H+(H2O)2.
The secondary structure is very variable for the group A salts. For example, in the case of H3PW12O40·nH2O, it is cubic for n = 06 (lattice constants are 1.17 nm for n = 0.3 and 1.213 nm for n = 6), and also cubic for n = 29 but the lattice constant is 2.333 nm. 27-29 The crystal structures of Cs and NH4 salts are the same as the cubic H3PW12O40·6H2O,27 with cations at the sites of H+(H2O)2 sites. The pyridine molecules (Py) are also paired around proton forming PyH+Py cations in [(Py)2H]3PW12O40.30a Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) molecules also form DMSOH+DMSO cations in [(DMSO)2H]4SiW12O40·DMSO.30b It must be remembered however that Cs or NH4 salts of H4SiW12O40 form amorphous or cubic structures. Here the cubic structure accommodates only three large monovalent cations at the regular cation sites. For example, Cs3HSiW12O40 forms a stable cubic structure.
B. Surface Area, Pore Structure, and Self-Assembly
Hydrogen forms and group A salts (e.g., Na, Mg), which are prepared from aqueous solutions, have low surface areas (115 m2 g-1), reflecting their high solubility in water. Partial hydrolysis sometimes occurs due to an increase in pH during neutralization and drying processes. On the other hand, the surface areas of group B salts (Cs, NH4, etc.) are much higher (50200 m2 g-1). Very fine particles are instantaneously precipitated when these cations are titrated to aqueous solutions of H3PW12O40 and H3PMo12O40. As described below, the control of pore structure as well as epitaxial assembly is possible for these salts.
The surface areas of CsxH4-xSiW12O40 were reported to be 9.0, 23, 49, and 83 m2 g-1 for x = 0, 2, 2.5, and 3, respectively,31 and those of CsxH3-xPW12O40 6.0, 1.0, 1.2, 135, and 156 m2 g-1 for x = 0, 1, 2.5, and 3, respectively.32 Similarly, in the case of CsxH4-xPVMo11O40, the surface areas were 2.6, 11.2, 10.0, 130, 164, and 103 m2 g-1 for x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4, respectively.33 The surface areas are variable depending on the precipitation and drying process. Washing partially removes hydrogen forms in the product.
The pores of HPA described here are interparticle, not intracrystalline, according to the TEM observation and nitrogen adsorption measurement.34 Cs3PW12O40 is composed of fine primary particles as observed by TEM. Considering the size and shape of the Keggin anion and the crystal structure of Cs3PW12O40, there are no open pores in the crystal structure through which an nitrogen molecule (0.36 nm in diameter) can penetrate. Gregg and Tayyab found that (NH4)3PW12O40 has micropores (pore diameter; <2 nm).35 Moffat et al. reported that the salts of NH4 and Cs possess micro- and mesopores as revealed by nitrogen adsorption and the pore size distribution varies by the size of the cation species.36 They further suggested that these pores exist in the crystal structure, while we indicated this to be unlikely. Recently, it was found that the micropore structure (>0.59 nm) can be controlled by the partial substitution of H by Cs or NH4 in H3PW12O40.37,38
The pore size of acidic Cs salts (CsxH3-xPW12O40) was precisely controlled by the Cs content.24,39,40 Figure 2 shows the adsorptiondesorption isotherms of nitrogen. H3PW12O40 exhibited a type II isotherm, indicating that this is nonporous. Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 showed a type IV isotherm, similar to Cs3PW12O40. These have micro- and mesopores.
Figure 2 Isotherms of N2 adsorption on CsxH3-xPW12O40 and (NH4)3PW12O40 at 77 K. The catalysts were pretreated at 573 K in vacuum: () adsorption branch; () desorption branch. (NH4)3PW12O40 was precipitated at 368 K. H3, Csx, and (NH4)3 denote H3PW12O40, CsxH3-xPW12O40, and (NH4)3PW12O40, respectively.
On the other hand, Cs2.2H0.8PW12O40 and (NH4)3PW12O40 showed a type I isotherm and most of adsorption took place at the very low pressure region, indicating the presence of only micropores. The pore sizes of CsxH3-xPW12O40 estimated from the adsorption of molecules having various molecular sizes were in the range 0.620.72 nm for x = 2.2, larger than 0.85 nm for x = 2.5, and less than 0.59 nm for x = 2.1.24,39,40
Probable preparation processes for CsxH3-xPW12O40 (randomly oriented nanocrystallites formed by precipitation at 298 K) are schematically illustrated in Figure 3.41 When the Cs content, x, is low, ultrafine particles of Cs3PW12O40 (810 nm in diameter) are thickly covered by H3PW12O40 after drying the solution. Heat treatment converted them to particles having a size similar to that before heat treatment and nearly uniform composition. This homogenization process was confirmed by 31P NMR and XRD.23,24 At x = 2.5, the hydrogen form, which remains in solution in a small quantity, forms very thin films or small islands on Cs3PW12O40 after drying. Heat treatment produces fine particles having a uniform composition of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 as discussed in section II.A. This mechanism can explain the unusual trend that the pore size increases with the surface area for x = 23.

Novel porous aggregates of (NH4)3PW12O40 and Cs3PW12O40 nanocrystallites are formed by controlling the preparation conditions.38 Figure 4a shows a SEM image of the aggregate of (NH4)3PW12O40 precipitated at 368 K. The BET surface area was 78 m2 g-1, which is much greater than the outer surface of the dodecahedron seen in Figure 4a (3 m2 g-1), demonstrating that the dodecahedron is porous inside. This dodecahedron can be regarded as a single crystal, as discussed below.
Figure 4 The microstructure of (NH4)3PW12O40 dodecahedron: (a) SEM image of (NH4)3PW12O40 prepared at 368 K using (NH4)2CO3; (b) schematic illustration of dodecahedron shown in the SEM image; and (c) electron diffraction image.
The sizes of nanocrystallites in the aggregates were calculated from the BET surface area assuming spherical shape (denoted by d(BET)) and the lengths of ordered crystal structure from the calibrated line width of XRD (denoted by L(XRD)). For dispersed primary particles as in the case of Cs3PW12O40 prepared at 298 K (1015 nm) these two values were comparable with each other. The crystal orientation was random and ring patterns were observed in electron diffraction.
However, for the sample shown in Figure 4a, the L(XRD) and d(BET) were 81150 nm and 16 nm, respectively. The much larger value of L(XRD) (>80 nm) means that the nanocrystallites (16 nm) are connected epitaxially in an aggregate. This is supported by the discrete regular spots observed in electron diffraction as shown in Figure 3c. Hence, the crystal planes of the nanocrystallites orient regularly in an aggregate. In another word, this aggregate looks like a porous single crystal. There is an intermediate case as well; round porous aggregates formed for (NH4)3PW12O40 precipitated at 273 K and Cs3PW12O40 at 368 K showed regular spots in electron diffraction, but XRD indicates that the epitaxial connections are not well developed.42 It seems that the solubility of the salts at the precipitation temperature controls the microstructure. The higher the solubility, the more the epitaxial connection between nanocrystallites is formed.
C. Thermal Stability
There are various kinds of stabilities, for example, thermal stability and hydrolytic stability in solution, and those stabilities change very much depending on the kind of HPAs.1,5 Some solid HPAs are thermally stable and applicable to vapor-phase reactions conducted at high temperatures. The thermal stability of hydrogen forms of HPAs changes with heteroatom, polyatom, and polyanion structure as follows: H3PW12O40 > H3PMo12O40 > H4SiMo12O40, and H3PW12O40 is much more stable than H6P2W18O62. 43-4531P NMR and thermoanalysis indicate that thermolysis of H3PMo12O40 proceeds by losses of water of crystallization and subsequently constitutional water to form PMo12O38.5. 46 The presence of PMo12O38.5 has not yet been confirmed in the pure state. Above 723 K, the Keggin structure of H3PMo12O40 is completely destroyed.
Thermal stability of mixed-addenda heteropolyanions is low in general. Recently, it has been demonstrated by IR and NMR spectroscopy that V5+ in H3+xPM12-xVxO40 (M = Mo, W) is expelled from the polyanion framework upon thermal treatment above 463 K or during catalytic oxidation. In the latter case, the formation of VO2+ salt of H3PM12O40 is suggested: 4H+ + PMo11VO404- + isobutyric acid  VO2+ + 2H+ + 11/12PMo12O404.09- + 1/12PO43- + 2H2O + methacrylic acid. 47,48 On the other hand, it should be considered at the same time that the regeneration of H3PM12O40 from the decomposed mixture sometimes takes place. 49,50
The thermal stability of H3PMo12O40 and its salts changes with countercations. Bi- and tervalent metal salts are not stable. The hydrogen form and ammonium salt decomposed at 693 and 743 K, respectively. Cs and K salts are stable up to their melting points. 51 The thermal stability changes generally in the order of Ba2+, Co2+ < Cu2+, Ni2+ < H+, Cd2+ < Ca2+, Mn2+ < Mg2+ < La3+,Ce3+ < NH4+ < K+, Tl+, Cs+.51 The thermal stability of Dawson heteropolyanion is also increased by the formation of K salt. H6P2W18O62 decomposed at 573 K, but the potassium salt was stable at 723 K. 52,53 As for the hydrogen cesium salts, the formation of water by the reaction between proton and the oxide ion in Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 at and above 623 K was recently reported. 54
D. Adsorption and Absorption Properties
One of the remarkable characteristics is that some solid HPAs (group A, hydrogen forms included) absorb easily a large quantity of polar or basic molecules such as alcohols and nitrogen bases in the solid bulk.4,18,55 The absorption depends on basicity and the size of the molecule to be absorbed and the rigidness of the secondary structure. As for the desorption, alcohols absorbed can readily leave the bulk, but the desorption of pyridine and ammonia needs a high temperature. Nonpolar molecules like hydrocarbons are usually adsorbed only on the surface of group A and B salts. However, it was suggested that isobutylene was absorbed into HPAs, being assisted by coexisting methanol.52
Diffusion coefficients measured quantitatively for H3PW12O40 are much lower than those in the micropores of zeolites but are close to those in the liquid phase.18,55,56 The quantity of absorbed molecules tends to be integral multiples of the number of protons.18,55 An interesting application of this behavior is to control the tertiary structure by utilizing pyridinium salts in the preparation of commercial catalysts for the oxidation of methacrolein. 57,58 The rigidness of HPAs depends on the countercations (size, charge, etc.) and apparently on the water content, as well. Group B salts like CsxH3-xPW12O40 (x > 2) adsorb even polar molecules only on the surface.
IR and NMR spectroscopies provide information about the structure of absorbed species.21,59-62 For example, the IR spectrum of protonated diethyl ether dimer in H3PW12O40, [(C2H5)2OH+O(C2H5)2], showed a characteristic ν(OH) band at 1527 cm-1.32 H3PW12O40.6C2H5OH gave three 1H NMR resonances at 9.5, 4.2, and 1.6 ppm due to OH, CH2, and CH3, respectively. This is assigned to a protonated dimer, (C2H5OH)2H+. The chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton of H3PW12O40·6C2H5OH (9.4 ppm) is close to those reported for protonated ethanol in superacids: 8.3 in HFBF3, 9.3 in FSO3FSbF5SO2, and 9.9 ppm in HSO3F 63 (as compared with 1.0 ppm for a dilute ethanol solution). In this respect, the pseudoliquid phase of H3PW12O40 may be regarded to be a superacidic media. The 13C NMR spectrum demonstrates the presence of three different species for ethanol absorption: (C2H5OH)2H+, C2H5OH2+, and ethoxide in H3PW12O40.
The dynamic behavior of CH3OH molecules in the pseudoliquid phase has been analyzed in detail.61 Figure 5 shows 1H NMR spectra of H3PW12O40·n13CH3OH with n = 1, 6, 7, and 9. For n = 0, a broad peak was observed at 10.0 ppm (not shown). The peak at around 5 ppm is due to the methyl group of 13CH3OH. Besides this methyl proton, one peak was observed at 911 ppm for all samples. This is assigned to the coalesced peak of hydroxyl protons of 13CH3OH and acidic protons of H3PW12O40. This indicates that these protons are mobile and exchanging the positions rapidly with each other. The line width (Figure 5) exhibited drastic narrowing for both methyl and hydroxyl peaks when n exceeded 6. Thus, the hydroxyl protons of CH3OH and the protons of H3PW12O40 exchange rapidly in a wide range of absorption level, but CH3OH molecules become very mobile when n exceeded 6.

It was reported that H3PW12O40 absorbed NO up to 3 molecules/anion. The heating of the NO-containing H3PW12O40 produced nitrogen, 64,65 although the structural changes have not been elucidated.
E. Supported HPAs
Dispersing HPAs on solid supports with high surface areas is important for catalytic application because the surface area of unsupported HPAs are usually low (110 m2 g-1). The supported catalysts are characterized by various methods and the changes in the acid strength, redox properties, and structure have been reported. In general, HPAs strongly interact with supports at low loading levels, while the bulk properties of HPAs prevail at high loading levels. Acidic or neutral substances such as SiO2, active carbon, acidic ion-exchange resin are suitable supports, the most frequently used support being SiO2.1,2,4 Solids having basicity such as Al2O3 and MgO tend to decompose HPAs (note the pH range of hydrolysis of heteropolyanion). 66-69
Certain active carbons can firmly entrap HPAs and, therefore, show high stability against the leakage into solvent from the carrier, when HPAs are used in solution. 70-72 The maximum loading level of HPAs on carbons was 714 wt % and varied moderately with the physical properties of the carbon support, but little with the chemical treatment.8
Enhanced catalytic activity of HPAs was found when they were supported on a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin, Amberlyst-15. 73,74 The activity was much higher than those of Amberlyst-15 and of the acids supported on active carbon. The higher activity was explained by the synergism due to the interaction of the heteropolyanions and protons of the ion exchanger.
It has been reported that H3PMo12O40 was uniformly and finely immobilized into a polysulfone film. The catalyst exhibited an improved catalytic activity for the conversion of alcohols such as ethyl and isopropyl alcohol. 75,76 For example, this film catalyst showed a higher yield of acetone but a lower yield of propene than H3PMo12O40 itself. This is mainly because the acidic function of H3PMo12O40 is suppressed by the adsorbed dimethyformamide and the formation of acetone is enhanced by the uniformly and finely dispersed H3PMo12O40 in polysulfone film.75
Microcalorimetry of ammonia absorption (adsorption) reveals that the supporting of H3PW12O40 on to SiO2 results in a decrease in the acid strength. Only 20% of the entire protons remained as strong as those in the neat H3PW12O40, and the rest showed heats of adsorption similar to those of HX and HY zeolites.71 It was reported that the acid strength of supported H3PW12O40 diminishes in the sequence of supports: SiO2 > α-Al2O3 > activated charcoal. 77 The interactions between H3PW12O40 and the surface OH groups of SiO2 have been detected at low loading levels by 1H and 31P MAS NMR and Raman spectroscopies. 78-82
SiO2-supported heteropolymolybdates such as H4SiMo12O40, H3PMo12O40, and H5PMo10V2O40 retain mostly the Keggin structure at a high loading level, but partly decompose at very low loading due to their strong interactions with surface silanol groups. 83-88 It is notable that a thermally decomposed Keggin structure on SiO2 surface can be reconstructed in some cases upon exposure to water vapor. 83,89 It was also reported for a SiO2 support that P in H3PW12O40 is partially replaced with Si of the support. 90 Thus, heteropolyanions on the oxide surface show dynamic behavior depending on the conditions.
Recently, H3PW12O40 supported on mesoporous pure-silica molecular sieve MCM-41 and pillared layered double hydroxide exchanged with Keggin heteropolyanions have been reported. 91 It is claimed in the former case that H3PW12O40 retains the Keggin structure at loading levels above 20 wt %. No crystalline phase of H3PW12O40 is seen at loading levels as high as 50 wt % (see later section for catalytic function). The acid catalysis by micro- or mesoporous CsxH3-xPW12O40 (x  2.1) will be described also in the later section.
III. Acid and Redox Properties
A. Acidic Properties
In early studies, it was shown that HPAs such as H3PW12O40 and H3PMo12O40 in the solid state are pure Brnsted acids 92 and stronger acids than the conventional solid acids such as SiO2-Al2O3, H3PO4/SiO2, and HX and HY zeolites. 77,93 According to an indicator test using Hammett indicators, H3PW12O40 was suggested to be a superacid, 93-96 but firm evidence has not been obtained. Although pyridine adsorbed on SiO2-Al2O3 is completely desorbed at 573 K, pyridine sorbed in H3PW12O40 mostly remains at 573 K, indicating that H3PW12O40 is a very strong acid.18 Here, it is to be noted that the interaction energy between HPAs and pyridine contains somehow the lattice energy of the pyridinium salt.
Thermal desorption of ammonia also shows that H3PW12O40 is an acid stronger than ZSM-5, but weaker than SO42-/ZrO2.94 Here nitrogen was also formed from ammonia, so that it was assumed that the nitrogen formation from ammonia took place after ammonia desorption. The strengths of heteropolytungstic acids have recently been determined more quantitatively by calorimetry of ammonia absorption. 77,97 Since the ammonia uptake takes place in the solid bulk, the contribution from the heat of lattice formation is included in these values as in the case of pyridine. The data show that the acid sites of H3PW12O40 are rather uniform and more strongly acidic than those of H-ZSM-5. The initial heats of absorption of ammonia measured at 423 K were 196, 185, 164, and 156 kJ mol-1 for H3PW12O40, H4SiW12O40, H6P2W21O71(H2O)3, and H6P2W18O62, respectively.77 The Keggin HPAs are much stronger acids than Dawson HPAs. The heats of ammonia adsorption were 150 and 140 kJ mol-1 for HZSM-5 and γ-Al2O3, respectively.97 Recently, it has been indicated by the calorimetric titration in acetonitrile that anhydrous H3PW12O40 is a superacid. 98
The strength and the number of acid centers of HPAs can be controlled by the structure and composition of heteropolyanions, the extent of hydration, the type of support, the thermal pretreatment, etc.
The acidic properties of salts are more complex. Five mechanisms have been proposed for the generation acidity in metal salts:1,4 (i) dissociation of coordinated water, for example refs 1 and 5, Ni(H2O)m2+  Ni(H2O)m-1(OH)+ + H+; (ii) Lewis acidity of metal ions; (iii) protons formed by the reduction of metal ions, Ag+ + 1/2H2  Ag0 + H+; (iv) protons present in the acidic salts, for example, e.g., CsxH3-xPW12O40; (v) partial hydrolysis during the preparation process, for example, H3PW12O40 + 3H2O  PW11O397- + WO42- + 9H+.
Many efforts are still being devoted to characterize the acidity of the salts of HPAs, by means of adsorption and thermal desorption of basic molecules77 as well as by NMR. 98-102
The temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia showed that Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 and H3PW12O40 have similar acid strength.21 According to indicator tests, Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 like H3PW12O40 had the acid strength 13.16.21 In TPD of ammonia, Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 gave a little broader peak than H3PW12O40, showing a slight inhomogeneiety of the acid strength.94 As the Cs content, x in CsxH3-xPW12O40, increased, the number of surface protons decreased at first, but greatly increased when the Cs content exceeded 2 and showed the highest surface acidity at x = 2.5 (see below for interpretation).23
Protons are formed by the reduction of Ag+ in Ag3PW12O40 (type iii).98-102 Ag3PW12O40 generated two kinds of protons, at 6.4 and 9.3 ppm in H-NMR, when the silver salt was partially reduced with hydrogen.99,102 The former appeared only when hydrogen was present in the gas phase. The dependence of the line shapes of the two peaks on the spinning rate indicated that the protons observed at 6.4 ppm are mobile even at room temperature, while the protons observed at 9.3 ppm are not. When the temperature was raised to 373 K in the presence of hydrogen, they merged into one peak, due to the exchange between the two kinds of protons. On the other hand, the temperature dependence of the line width was not observed for H3PW12O40 (9.1 ppm).
It was reported for Pd0-H3PW12O40 that the hydrogen atoms spillover to the surrounding heteropolyanions: H on Pd0  H+ in H3PW12O40. 103 As shown in Figure 6a, hydrogen atoms adsorbed on Pd0 and protons in H3PW12O40 were observed at 19.8 and 9.1 ppm, respectively. The peak at 4.7 ppm is attributed to H2O molecules. When Pd0-H3PW12O40 catalyst was heated to 333 K in the presence of hydrogen, the line widths of two peaks at 19.8 and 9.1 ppm were broadened and the peak of hydrogen atoms shifted toward that of acidic protons at 9.1 ppm (Figure 6b,c). This indicates that the interconversion occurs between them and that the hydrogen atoms on Pd0 spillover to the surrounding polyanions. The line width of the peak at 9.1 ppm depended on the spinning rate at 373 K, indicating that the protons are mobile. The fact is in contrast with the independence of the peak on the spinning rate in the case of H3PW12O40 at 373 K.

B. Redox Properties
The oxidizing ability of HPAs in the solid state has been estimated by various methods: rates of reduction of HPAs,13,104-110 and ESR and XPS spectra of reduced HPAs.16,49,111-115 It must be considered that the results are affected significantly by the method of reduction as well as the purity of the samples.1,4 Another important reason for the apparent inconsistency in the literature may be the ignorance of the presence of surface- and bulk-type reactions (see below).
Various parameters such as the heat of oxide formation, ionic potential, the electronegativity, etc., have been proposed for the controlling factors of the redox property. 116-118 As to the controlling methods, the selection of the kinds of cation and the polyanion composition have been investigated. Although clear correlations have not been attained yet, several useful trends have been pointed out.1,4
1. Reduction Mechanism
The reduction of H3PM12O40 (M = Mo, W) and its Na salts by hydrogen proceeds in the following three steps:13,104,105,119
The first step is H2  2H+ (present between polyanions) + 2e (present in polyanion), without formation of water. Here the number of electrons introduced per anion is variable. In the second step, the protons formed in the first step react with the oxygen of polyanion to form water, which evolves in step 3 into the gas phase.20,104 Further reduction brings about irreversible reduction to several species.
As far as the Keggin structure is maintained during reduction (I  II), most of Mo5+ are not detectable by ESR due to the rapid electron hopping as in solution. 120 A heat treatment converts II to III, and the Mo5+ signal grows, electrons being localized. IR studies on isotopic oxygen exchange and the reduction process indicate that reactive oxygen is the bridging oxygen.111,112,121 A quantum chemical calculation by Xα method is consistent with this idea. 122
The diffusion of protons and electrons in the solid of H3PM12O40 (M = Mo, W) is very rapid as compared with the rate of reduction, 119,123 since the isotopic equilibration of H2D2 in the gas phase as well as in the entire solid phase was very rapid (573 K). Electronic conductivity measurements (electron as well as proton) at 473523 K supported this, while the conductivity very much depended on the composition and thermal treatment. 124 At low temperatures the proton conduction prevails. 125 The detailed kinetic analysis shows that eq 1 is very rapid and eq 2 is the slow step: I  II  (slow) III. With H3PW12O40, the equilibrium strongly favors the left side of eq 1, while for H3PMo12O40 the equilibrium favors the right side.119,123
Since the reduction of H3PM12O40 (M = Mo, W) by hydrogen proceeds in the solid bulk by the rapid migration of protons and electrons,119,123,126 the rate depends little on the specific surface area. In other words, the rate is proportional to the number of polyanions in the bulk.
In contrast, the rates of reduction by CO of H3PMo12O40 and its alkali salts under the dry conditions are proportional to the specific surface areas as in the case of ordinary heterogeneous catalysis (surface type). Hence, due to the slow diffusion of oxide ion, the reduction mostly proceeds near the surface.110 The slow diffusion of oxide ion is demonstrated by the effect of the interruption105 of the reoxidation by oxygen on its time course and the relative rates of isotopic exchange for 16O2-18O2-H3PMo12O40 and H218O-H3PMo12O40. 127
Figure 7 Schematic illustration of bulk-type (II) and surface-type catalysis: (a) bulk type and (b) surface type.
The contrast between the two types is found in organic reactions, as well. The noncatalytic reduction of H3PMo12O40 by the dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid or cyclohexene belongs to the bulk type (II) (Figure 7a) and the reduction by the oxygenation of methacrolein or acetaldehyde belongs to the surface type (Figure 7b). Catalytic reactions of the two types will be described in the later section.
2. Reoxidation
In general, when the extent of reduction is low, the reoxidation is fast and reversible. In the case of H3PMo12O40,the redox cycle between I  II is rapid and reversible; I  III, rapid near the surface, but slow in the bulk, and both reversible; and I  III (excessively reduced species), slow and mostly irreversible (I, II, and III refer to eqs 13).105
In the reoxidation by oxygen of one-electron (1 e) reduced CsxH3-xPMo12O40, the rates divided by the surface area show a monotonic variation with x, indicating surface-type behavior.1,105b A similar variation was observed for Na and K salts. It was suggested that the reoxidizability increases with an increase in the standard electrode potential of the countercation. 128 The presence of water vapor sometimes accelerates the migration of oxide ion, probably in the form of OH- or H2O and makes surface-type reactions more like bulk type (II).110
It was reported in solution that oxidation of P2W18O627- and PV2Mo10O407- proceeds by 7-coordinate metal centers with MO bond, such as bridging and terminal oxygen adducts or ozonide. 129-131 Very recently, it was also reported by 17O NMR experiments in solution that the reoxidation of II  I proceeds by an outer-sphere mechanism without participation of lattice oxide ions.129 This mechanism appears more probable since the energetics of the sterically congested metal centers and the weak OO bond in an ozonide are unattractive and the rates of II  I, at least in some systems, are known to be faster than that of oxygen exchange between H2O and polyanions. 132-135 It is interesting to study how the reoxidation mechanism in solution reflects on that in the solid state.
3. Effects of Constituent Elements on the Redox Properties
The effect of mixed-addenda atoms is important to control the redox properties, as mixed-addenda HPAs are utilized as industrial oxidation catalysts. However, the redox mechanism and its relation to oxidation catalysis remain unclarified. For example, the rate of reduction by hydrogen is slower and less reversible for solid PMo12-xVxO40(3+x)- than for solid PMo12O403- although in solution the former systems are stronger oxidants than the latter. 136 The thermal treatment of H4PMo11VO40 formed PMo12O403- and VO2+ and the reduction of H4PMo11VO40 with isobutyric acid formed PMo12O404.09-, VO2+, PO43-, and methacrylic acid.47,48 These decomposition reactions are deeply related to the controversy about the effects of substitution by V for Mo on the catalytic activity.47,48,136-140 It is also unclear why the rate of reduction decreases with the content of alkali cation.105
IV. Heterogeneous Catalysis
A. Three Types of Catalysis
There are three types of catalysis of solid HPAs; (1) surface, (2) bulk type I (= pseudoliquid), and (3) bulk type II catalysis, as shown in Table 2. The latter two were demonstrated so far specifically for heteropoly catalysts, but could be found for other solid catalysts, as well.

1. Surface-Type Catalysis
Surface-type catalysis is the ordinary heterogeneous catalysis, where the reactions take place on the two-dimensional surface (outer surface and pore wall) of solid catalysts. The reaction rate is proportional to the surface area in principle. Rates of double-bond isomerization of olefins are proportional to the surface area of H3PMo12O40. 141 Most acid-catalyzed reactions over CsxH3-xPW12O40 (2 < x < 3) show similar parallelism between the rate and surface acidity.1,2
2. Bulk-Type (I) Catalysis
In the bulk-type (I) catalysis, e.g., acid-catalyzed reactions of polar molecules over the hydrogen forms and group A salts at relatively low temperatures, the reactant molecules are absorbed in the interpolyanion space of the ionic crystal (not intrapolyanion) and react there, and then the products desorb from the solid.5,18,55 The solid behaves in a sense like a solution and the reaction field becomes three dimensional. Therefore, we call this pseudoliquid catalysis. The reaction rate is proportional to the volume of catalyst in the ideal case, or, for example, the rate of acid-catalyzed reaction is governed by the bulk acidity. This type of catalysis has been observed not only for gassolid but also for liquidsolid systems. 142
The transient response method by using deuterated and nondeuterated alcohols confirmed that a large number of alcohol molecules are absorbed in the catalyst bulk under the reaction conditions of dehydration and the adsorption/desorption is faster than the dehydration. 143
The unusual pressure dependencies of the rate and selectivity associated with the pseudoliquid were observed for alcohol dehydration,59,144,145 etherification,59,144,145 and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) synthesis.47 Examples are shown in Figure 8;144,145 hydrogen forms exhibit unusual pressure dependencies in contrast to the surface-type catalysis of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40. In the case of the dehydration of ethanol, the amounts of ethanol absorbed under the reaction conditions corresponded to 480 times the monolayer value and the change in the amount corresponded to the unusual pressure dependency of the reaction.59 It is notable that the activity of H3PW12O40 is 102 times greater than that of SiO2-Al2O3. 146
Figure 8 Rates of formation of diethyl ether and ethylene from ethanol and those of formation of MTBE from isobutylene and methanol catalyzed by H3PW12O40 and Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 as a function of the partial pressure of ethanol and methanol: (a and b) formation of diethyl ether () and ethylene (·) at 403 K; (c and d) formation of MTBE at 323 K; (a) H3PW12O40; (b) Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40; (c) H3PW12O40 () and H6P2W18O62 (); and (d) Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40.
Scheme 1. Reaction Scheme for Dehydration of Ethanol
The unusual pressure dependencies of the rate, selectivity, and the amount of absorbed ethanol are interpreted by the following mechanism. Plausible reaction intermediates in this mechanism such as protonated ethanol dimer, (C2H5OH)2H+, monomer, C2H5OH2+, and ethoxy group coordinated with polyanion were directly detected by solid-state NMR, as described before.59
Recently, Shikata et al. have found that MTBE synthesis from isobutylene and methanol was efficiently catalyzed by a Dawson HPA, H6P2W18O62, at low temperatures where the equilibrium favors the ether synthesis.52 The catalytic activity changed in the order of H6P2W18O62  H3PW12O40 > H4SiW12O40  H4GeW12O40 > H5BW12O40 > H6CoW12O40, whereby the selectivity to MTBE was higher than 95%. The activity of H6P2W18O62 was comparable with an ion-exchange resin and much better than SO42-/ZrO2, SiO2-Al2O3, and H-ZSM-5.
The MTBE synthesis proceeds in the pseudoliquid phase and the absorption/desorption property seemed to control the reaction rate.52 Isobutylene probably absorbs, being assisted by polar methanol molecules. In the pseudoliquid phase of the Dawson HPAs, the rate of methanol absorption is rapid and the amount of methanol absorbed is moderate to form active pseudoliquid phase as was observed for dehydration,59,144,145 probably due to its amorphous and flexible secondary structure. The Keggin HPAs tended to form a stable structure absorbing a much greater amount of reactant and becomes less active. The marked difference between Dawson and Keggin HPAs is presumably brought about by the shape of the polyanion itself (ellipsoid for Dawson vs spherical for Keggin).52 Supporting H6P2W18O62 on SiO2 greatly increased the yield of MTBE, but decreased the merit due to the pseudoliquid behavior of Dawson HPAs. Hence, in the case of MTBE synthesis, the rates of reaction and diffusion of reactant may be comparable.
3. Bulk-Type (II) Catalysis
Certain oxidation reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidation of hydrogen at high temperatures exhibit bulk-type (II) catalysis.105 In this type of catalytic oxidation, although the principal reaction may proceed on the surface, the whole solid bulk takes part in redox catalysis owing to the rapid migration of redox carriers such as protons and electrons. The rate is proportional to the volume of catalyst in the ideal bulk-type (II) catalysis.
Figure 9ac shows the correlations between the oxidizing ability of catalysts and the catalytic activity for oxidation. 147-150 Monotonous correlations were observed between the rates of catalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde and methacrolein (surface-type reaction) and the rate of reduction of catalysts by CO (surface oxidizing ability).148,149 A similar good relationship for oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene (bulk-type (II) reaction) and the rate of reduction of catalysts by hydrogen (bulk oxidizing ability) was found (Figure 9c).150
Figure 9 Correlations between catalytic activity and oxidizing ability for oxidation of (a) acetaldehyde and (b) methacrolein (surface reactions) and (c) oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene (bulk-type (II) reaction). r(acetaldehyde), r(methacrolein), and r(cyclohexene) are the rates of catalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde, methacrolein, and oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, respectively. r(CO) is the rate of reduction of catalysts by CO; r(H2), rate of reduction of catalysts by H2. Mx denotes MxH3-xPMo12O40. Na2-1, -2, -3, and -4 are Na2HPMo12O40 of different lots, of which surface areas are 2.8, 2.2, 1.7, and 1.2 m2 g-1, respectively.
A redox (or Marsvan Krevelen) mechanism has been demonstrated for the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen (bulk-type (II)) and CO (surface-type) over alkali salts of H3PMo12O40; the rates of catalytic oxidation, the rates of reduction and reoxidation of catalysts coincided with each other at the stationary oxidation state of catalyst as summarized in Table 3.105,110 Due to the thermal instability, no such correlations have been established for H3+xPMo12-xVxO40 (x  1).

B. Heterogeneous Acid-Catalyzed Reactions1. General Characteristics
Acidity, basicity, and pseudoliquid behavior are the principal factors governing the acid catalysis of solid HPAs. The acidic properties are mainly controlled by (i) the structure and composition of the heteropolyanion itself, (ii) the countercations, and (iii) the dispersion on supports. The acid strength can be controlled mainly by i, and the number of acid sites is greatly influenced by ii and iii. The secondary and tertiary structures are also affected by the three factors. In addition to the acidic properties, the absorption properties for polar molecules are critical in determining the catalytic function in the case of pseudoliquid catalysis. Besides, soft basicity of the heteropolyanion itself sometimes plays an important role for high catalytic activity. Although the relationship between basicity and solubility of AgnX and AgI is not evident, the soft basicity of polyanion as estimated by the equilibrium constant in aqueous solution of the reaction, AgnX + nNaI  nAgI + NanX (X = polyanion), was in the order of SiW12O404- > GeW12O404- > PW12O403- > PMo12O403- > SiMo12O404- > SO42-. 151,152 Although the role has not sufficiently been clarified, it seems that successful industrial applications in the liquid phase take advantage of this soft basicity.
The acidity of hydrogen forms in the solid state reflects in general the acidity in solution; the acid strength decreases when W is replaced by Mo and when the central P atom is replaced by Si for Keggin HPAs, which are stronger acids than Dawson HPAs.77 The acid strength for Keggin 12-tungstates in acetonitrile solution increased with an increase in the charge of heteropolyanion. 153 The rates of heterogeneous alkylation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene catalyzed by the hydrogen forms of several 12-tungstates are correlated well with the negative charge of polyanion. 153,154 This correlation indicates that the acid strength of the hydrogen form of 12-tungstates in the solid state reflects that in solution and decreases with increasing negative charge of the polyanion. On the other hand, it was reported for HPAs of Mo that the acid strength in solution is not correlated with that in the solid.50
A remarkable effect of the countercation is shown in Figure 10a,b, where the reaction rates of several reactions are plotted against the extent of neutralization by Na or Cs, that is, x in MxH3-xPW12O40 (M = Na or Cs). 95,155 In the case of Na salts, the rates decrease more or less monotonically as the Na content increases. This change is in parallel with the change in the bulk acidity shown by the broken line in Figure 10a. Peculiar changes in activity are observed for the Cs salts (Figure 10b); maxima at x = 0 and 2.5, have been interpreted by the change in the surface acidity (= surface area multiplied by proton density on the surface) shown by the broken line in Figure 10b.95,155
Figure 10 Catalytic activities of acidic Na or Cs salts of H3PW12O40 as a function of Na or Cs content: (a) M = Na; () dehydration of 2-propanol, () conversion of methanol; and (b) M = Cs; () alkylation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with cyclohexene, () conversion of dimethyl ether. Broken lines in parts a and b indicate bulk and surface acidity, respectively. aNumber of pyridine molecules per anion which remained after the evacuation of 573 K.
Figure 11 shows the linear correlation between the catalytic activities and the surface acidity (data are from symbols  in Figure 10b). The catalytic activity increased linearly with the surface acidity. The results indicate that the acid strengths of acidic Cs salts are similar to that of the acid form, as is consistent with the results of ammonia-TPD. Thus, the high catalytic activity of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 is primarily due to the high surface acidity.
Figure 11 Surface acidity and catalytic activities for alkylation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with cyclohexene (closed symbols) and decomposition of cyclohexyl acetate (open symbols). Numbers in parentheses denote x in CsxH3-xPW12O40.
It is remarkable that the catalytic activities of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 for these reactions are much higher than those of SiO2-Al2O3, SO42-/ZrO2, and HY zeolite. Since the acid strength of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 is estimated to be between zeolite and SO42-/ZrO2 and the acid amount was much less than those of SiO2-Al2O3, SO42-/ZrO2, and HY zeolite, there must be additional effects such as acidbase bifunctional acceleration by the cooperation of proton (acid) and polyanion (base) (see the much greater slope for CsxH3-xPW12O40 than the other solid acids in Figure 11).95
The catalyst deactivation is usually observed during the catalytic reaction, and the deactivation is sensitive to the kind of reactant, product, solvent, and reaction temperature. There are several possible causes for the catalyst deactivation, e.g., coke formation, adsorption of products, catalyst reduction, catalyst decomposition, and catalyst dissolution. Deactivation due to reduction was observed, for example, for the dehydration of 2-propanol catalyzed by HPAs containing Mo and V. An oxygen treatment of the deactivated H3PMo12O40 restored the initial catalytic activity, 156 while no such deactivation was observed for HPAs of W. The coke formation or strong adsorption of polymerized products often causes deactivation as in the case of other solid acids.
Therefore, the suppression of the deactivation and the method of regeneration are the important problems in the acid catalysis of HPAs. The selection of a catalyst having uniform and appropriate acid strength is a way to avoid the catalyst deactivation: This may be the reason for the little deactivation observed in the isomerization of butene catalyzed by H3PW12O40·6H2O.156 The deactivation of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 catalyst due to the coke formation for the isomerization of n-pentane was much suppressed by the presence of hydrogen and Pt/Al2O3. Hydrogen atom spilt over from Pt probably removes the coke precursor by hydrogenation. What is more interesting is that the deactivation was almost absent in this case in contrast to the large deactivation of SO42-/ZrO2 + Pt/Al2O3 as shown in Figure 12. 157 This is presumably brought about by the uniform and moderate acid strength of HPA.157

2. Shape-Selective Acid Catalysis
Figure 13 shows the time courses of the adsorption of cyclohexyl acetate (0.60 nm) and isopropyl acetate (0.50 nm) on Cs2.2H0.8PW12O40 and Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40.24 Both cyclohexyl acetate and isopropyl acetate were adsorbed on Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40. The ratio of the adsorption isopropyl acetate to cyclohexyl acetate was about 1.5, which was close to the ratio of the molecular cross section of the two molecules. On the other hand, the adsorption of cyclohexyl acetate was about 1/10 that of isopropyl acetate on Cs2.2H0.8PW12O40 as shown in Figure 13b. This result demonstrates that the adsorption of large molecules into the pore of the latter is difficult and that the shape selectivity exists in adsorption.
Figure 13 Time courses of the adsorption of isopropyl acetate () or cyclohexyl acetate () on (a) Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 and (b) Cs2.2H0.8PW12O40.
The shape selective adsorption is well reflected in the catalysis. Cs2.2H0.8PW12O40 effectively catalyzed the dehydration of 2-hexanol (molecular size 0.50 nm) and the decomposition of isopropyl acetate (0.50 nm), but was much less active for the reactions of larger molecules such as cyclohexyl acetate (0.60 nm) and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (0.75 nm).24,37 This is in contrast to Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40, for which high reaction rates were observed for all of these reactions.
It was reported that H3PW12O40 supported on mesoporous silica molecular sieve, MCM-41, exhibited a higher activity than H2SO4 in liquid-phase alkylation of 4-tert-butylphenol with isobutene and styrene. In the latter reaction, the catalyst gave a higher yield of 2-(1-phenylethyl)-4-tert-butylphenol than more bulky 2,6-bis(1-phenylethyl)-4-tert-butylphenol and is claimed to be a size-selective catalyst.91 Recently, it was found that the impregnation of MCM-41 with an aqueous solution of H3PW12O40 gave two species. One is an intact Keggin structure and the other is H6P2W18O62 and/or H6P2W21O71. The latter species was suggested to be about 8 times more active than the former species in the liquid-phase trans-de-tert-butylation of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. 158
The isobutane alkylation with 2-butene catalyzed by H3PW12O40 supported on MCM-41 was compared with those for MCM-22, H3PW12O40/SiO2, and H3PW12O40/Al2O3. The conversion of H3PW12O40/MCM-41 was 87%. The trimethylpentane to dimehylhexane ratio for H3PW12O40/MCM-41 was higher than those for H3PW12O40/SiO2 and H3PW12O40/Al2O3, but less than that for MCM-22. 159
3. Insoluble Solid Acid Catalysts for Liquid-Phase Reactions
Insoluble solid acid catalysts to replace soluble acids are desirable to make the catalytic processes environmentally benign. For this purpose, the hydrogen cesium, ammonium, and cerium salts and the inclusion of HPAs in silica matrix have been proposed.
Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40, as an insoluble acid, catalyzed the alkylation of isobutane with butenes and the catalytic activity was higher than that of H3PW12O40 and SO42-/ZrO2, although the problem of catalyst deactivation remains still unsolved in this case. 160 Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 also catalyzed the alkylation of p-xylene and was much more active than SO42-/ZrO2. 161 Izumi et al. found that (NH4)2HPW12O40 worked as an efficient insoluble acid catalyst for the liquid-phase FriedelCrafts alkylation (benzylation) of benzene and the acylation of p-xylene with benzoic anhydride or benzoyl chloride. 162 It was confirmed that (NH4)2HPW12O40 did not deteriorate during the benzoylation with benzoyl chloride, but gradually lost its activity due to partial dissolution. In contrast, no deterioration was observed for the benzoylation of p-xylene with benzoic anhydride catalyzed by the same HPA. As shown in Table 4, (NH4)2HPW12O40 was much more active than HY, LaY, and Nafion-H and comparable to or higher than Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 and Zn-montmorillonite.

Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 was remarkably active for the hydrolysis of 2-methylphenyl acetate in excess water, while H-ZSM-5, Nb2O5, or SO42-/ZrO2 was almost inactive. 163
The liquid-phase esterification of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid with n-BuOH is efficiently catalyzed by using an insoluble acidic Ce(III) salt of H3PW12O40, Ce0.87H0.4PW12O40. 164 The catalytic activity decreased in the order of Ce0.87H0.4PW12O40  Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40  Cs3PW12O40  Cs2HPW12O40  (NH4)3PW12O40 > K3PW12O40. Since the soluble H3PW12O40 was the most active, the possibility of partial dissolution of the acidic salts needs to be carefully examined for quantitative comparison.
Izumi et al. prepared H3PW12O40 and Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 which were included in a silica matrix by in situ preparation. 165 The catalysts had large surface areas, were insoluble in aqueous media, and efficiently catalyzed the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate. Leakage of H3PW12O40 into solution during the hydrolysis was as low as 0.3%. It is of interest that the catalytic activity of the silica-included H3PW12O40 is higher than H3PW12O40 in aqueous solution. They suggested that H3PW12O40 formed a highly concentrated aqueous solution in the matrix and was therefore more active. The fixation of H3PW12O40 on activated carbon70-72 and Amberlyst-1573,74 is also effective for the heterogeneous liquid-phase catalysis as described section II.E.
More recently, Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 supported in spherical particles of SiO2 gel was reported. 166,167 SiO2 was preimpregnated by Cs ions to form surface SiOCs groups. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed uniform Cs distribution at this stage. This then was subjected to impregnation by an aqueous solution of H3PW12O40. Insoluble Cs salts were precipitated in the particles to form a beautiful eggwhite-type distribution in the SiO2 particle as shown in Figure 14.

C. Heterogeneous Oxidation Reactions1. General Characteristics
Solid HPAs catalyze various oxygenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Keggin HPAs containing Mo and V as addenda atoms are usually used for the oxidations. So far the oxidation of methacrolein to methacrylic acid is the only large-scale commercialized process using HPAs. But, ethylene to acetic acid process will start soon. HPAs show a good performance also for oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid but the performance is insufficient for commercialization.
The catalysts reported in patents for heterogeneous oxidation contain several elements other than Mo, V, and P. An excess amount of P was added in patent literature, which was claimed to stabilize the structure. The addition of transition elements like Cu improves redox reversibility. Cs is often added probably to enhance the thermal stability and surface area by forming Cs salts. As for the structure of Cs-containing HPAs, the formation of an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen form on high-surface area Cs salt was suggested.26 On the other hand, we reported that a nearly uniform solid solution was formed for CsxH3-xPW12O40 by the diffusion of Cs and H.2,23-25 The real catalyst may be in between the two extremes.
To understand the oxidation catalysis of solid HPAs, the contrast between surface- and bulk-type (II) catalysis, and acidredox bifunctionality of heteropoly catalysts must be properly taken into account, in addition to the correlation between the oxidizing ability of catalysts and their catalytic activity.1,2,4,105,106,147,168 Interestingly, the two oxidation reactions described above to form methacrylic acid belong to surface- and bulk-type catalysis, respectively.147
The fundamental correlations between the redox properties and catalytic activity have successfully been established for the hydrogen form and alkali salts of 12-molybdophosphoric acid as described in the previous section.1,2,4 However, such correlations have not been obtained for mixed-addenda HPAs due to insufficient thermal stability.1,2,4,47,48 We attempted to stabilize the mixed coordinated HPAs such as molybdovanadophosphates by forming their cesium salts. Although the possibility of slight decomposition could not be excluded, high yields were obtained for the conversion of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid as shown in Figure 15.33 In this case, not only the thermal stability and surface area, but also the acidbase property changes very much with the Cs content, as indicated by the change in the product distribution.

2. Oxidation of Alkanes with Molecular Oxygen
There have been several attempts to obtain oxygenated products from lower alkanes (C2C5) by using heteropoly catalysts. It has been reported that H3PMo12O40 catalyzes the oxidation of lower alkanes, especially propane, isobutane, and pentane, and that the substitution of V5+ for Mo6+ improves the catalytic activity and selectivity.1,169-176
By optimizing the constituent elements of heteropolyanions and the countercations, fairly good yields were obtained for the oxidation of isobutane toward methacrylic acid (MAA) and methacrolein (MAL). 177-184 The results on CsxH3-xPMo12O40 catalysts are shown in Table 5. The highest conversion and yield of MAA were observed around x = 2.52.85. The catalytic properties of Cs2.5H0.5PMo12O40 also changed by the addition of transition metal ions.177 The addition of Ni, Mn, or Fe increased the yields of MAA and MAL. In the case of Ni, the yields of MAA and MAL reached 6.5 and 1.5%, respectively. In contrast, the addition of Co, Cu, Hg, Pt, and Pd decreased the yields.
Keggin V-substituted heteropolymolybdates, Cs2.5Ni0.08H1.34PVMo11O40, catalyzed more selectively the oxidation of isobutane into methacrolein and methacrylic acid. At 613 K the yield of methacrylic acid reached 9.0%. This yield was greater than the highest value of 6.2% reported at likely steady state in the patent literature.178 Cs2.5Mn+0.08H1.5-0.08nPVMo11O40 (M = Ni2+, Fe3+) also catalyzed the oxidation of propane and ethane.182-184
It is interesting that the reduced HPAs showed higher selectivities to methacrylic acid for the oxidation of isobutane.58,177,180,185 Ueda et al. applied prereduced 12-molybdophosphoric acid to the oxidation of propane and obtained 50% selectivity to acrylic acid and acrolein at 12% conversion.58
The conversion vs selectivity relationships of oxidation of isobutane catalyzed by Cs2.5Ni0.08H0.34PMo12O40 showed that the reaction proceeds according to Scheme 2. For example, the selectivities to MAL and COx extrapolated to 0% conversion were 75% and 25%, respectively, indicating that there are two parallel paths in the first step, that is, the selective oxidation of isobutane into MAL and the complete oxidation to COx. The selectivity to MAL decreased with an increase in the selectivity to MAA, showing the oxidation of MAL to MAA.181
Scheme 2. Reaction Mechanism of Oxidation of Isobutane
It was suggested from the comparison of the conversion vs selectivity data for Cs2.5Ni0.08H1.34PVMo11O40 that the complete oxidation reactions of MAL and MAA are suppressed and the selective oxidation of MAL into MAA is accelerated by the V substitution.181 The effect of V was recently discussed also for H4PVMo11O40. In this case, it was indicated that V expelled from the polyanion controls the redox property and suppresses the overoxidations of MAL and MAA. 186 The creation of inter-Keggin VOV bonds is suggested.172
Oxidative dehydrogenation is advantageous in comparison with simple dehydrogenation with respect to equilibrium, since it can achieve much higher conversion of alkanes at low temperatures and high pressures. Cavani et al. reported that Dawson monoiron-substituted heteropolytungstates and Keggin heteropolymolybdates are active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane53,187,188 and ethane, 189,190 respectively.
V. Bifunctional Catalysis
A. AcidRedox Catalysts
The acidity and oxidizing ability work cooperatively in the oxidation of methacrolein:13
The redox mechanism assisted by acidity (eq 4) was confirmed by the several experimental facts.1 For example, a fair correlation between the rate of catalytic oxidation and the oxidizing ability of catalyst was observed,13,149 showing that the rate-limiting step is the oxidative dehydrogenation of the intermediate (second step). Rapid and direct exchanges of isotopic oxygen exist between methacrolein, water, and catalyst, supporting the presence of preequilibrium for the first step.13,149 The first step in eq 4 is catalyzed by Brnsted acid, but is not rate limiting.
Competitive function of acidity and oxidizing ability was indicated by the changes in the selectivity for the dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid 191 and methanol. 192
B. MetalHPA Composite Catalysts
The skeletal isomerization of C4, C5, and C6 alkanes are efficiently catalyzed by Pd salt of H3PW12O40 193-195 and Pd- or Pt-Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 catalysts.41,54,196-198 In the case of Pd1.5PW12O40 as described before, protons are generated by the reaction of Pd2+ with hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen is necessary to maintain the high activity at the stationary state.
As for Pt with Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40, the effect of loading amount of Pt on the skeletal isomerization of n-butane to isobutane is shown in Figure 16.41,54,196-198 The reaction at the steady state was accelerated by a factor of about 4 by the addition of 0.1 wt % Pt, and the rate and selectivity became constant above 0.1 wt % Pt. Isobutane was formed for Pt- and Pd-Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 catalysts with high selectivities (9496%) and high rates. Hydrogen suppresses the catalyst deactivation by lowering the partial pressure of butenes and hydrogenating coke or precursor of the coke. Pt-Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 also showed higher activity and selectivity than Pt-SO42-/ZrO2 and Pt-Al2O3 for the skeletal isomerization of n-pentane and n-hexane.157
Figure 16 Effect of loading amount of Pt on n-butane isomerization over Pt-Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40: (·) conversion of n-butane, and () selectivity to isobutane. Conditions: feed gas, n-butane:H2:N2 = 0.05:0.50:0.45; catalyst, 1 g; W/F = 40 g h (n-butane mol)-1. Catalysts were pretreated with O2 at 573 K.
It was demonstrated that the high selectivity to isobutane for Pt-Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 is brought about by the unique roles of protons which suppress dramatically the hydrogenolysis and enhance the isomerization. For example, when a small amount of H3PW12O40 was impregnated onto Pt-Cs3PW12O40, the isomerization of n-butane proceeded rapidly and very selectively, and the hydrogenolysis on Pt-Cs3PW12O40 nearly completely stopped. This effect was not pronounced for the isomerization of n-pentane and n-hexane, since hydrogenolysis little took place on Pt-Cs3PW12O40 due to lower reaction temperatures. Scheme 3 illustrates this phenomenon.197,198 In the absence of proton, the hydrogenolysis proceeds on Pt, while in the presence of proton only the selective isomerization proceeds.
Scheme 3. A Proposed Reaction Scheme for Isomerization of n-Butane
Heterogeneous gassolid Wacker-type oxidation of butene to methyl ethyl ketone catalyzed by H3+nPVnMo12-nO40 in combination with Cu2+, Ni2+, Pd2+, and Cs+ salts has been reported, but there was significant catalyst deactivation. 199 Reoxidation of the reduced HPAs was a slow step, which was somehow accelerated by the presence of vanadium, Cu2+, or Ni2+. The combination of Pd and HPA is applied to the commercial oxidation of ethylene to acetic acid.
Pd-Cs2.5H0.34PVMo11O40-catalyzed selective oxidation of methane into formic acid with molecular oxygen in the presence of hydrogen at and above 423 K. 200 No selective oxidation proceeded without Pd or when carbon monoxide was used instead of hydrogen. The addition of 1.9 vol % hydrogen peroxide in place of hydrogen and oxygen showed a similar conversion and selectivity to oxygenates. This suggests that the active oxygen species comes from hydrogen peroxide formed by the hydrogenoxygen reaction catalyzed by Pd. Formic acid was also formed by the liquid-phase oxidation of methane with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by H4PVMo11O40. 201
VI. Future Opportunities
Future targets of research are all related to the advantageous properties of HPAs. Progresses are anticipated in the research areas of (1) design of solid acids stronger than superacid of H3PW12O40 and acids having moderate but uniform acid strengths, (2) design of inorganic synzymes (e.g., Fe,Mn-multisubstituted heteropolyanions) and the application to catalysis, (3) bifunctional acidbase or acidredox catalysis, (4) utilization of the unique properties such as pseudoliquid and controlled pores of the assembly of HPAs for stereoselective and shape-selective reactions, and (5) synthesis and utilization of HPAs of novel structures and compositions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
