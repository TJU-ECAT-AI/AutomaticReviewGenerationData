          [1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."

[3] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[4] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[5] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(·SiO)2TaH] involves several key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in the reactants (e.g., ethane and toluene), resulting in the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reactants and different types of C-H bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The C-H activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalum-ethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], tantalum-benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5], and tantalum-methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] species.

3. Reaction with alkanes: These intermediate complexes then react with alkane molecules (e.g., ethane) to produce new alkanes (e.g., propane) and aromatic products (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes), while forming a tantalum-methyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The catalytic cycle is completed by the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an alkane or aromatic molecule, regenerating the key intermediate complexes.

The mechanism appears to follow a one-site scheme, as there is no explicit mention of a two-site process. The reaction involves both cleavage and formation of C-C bonds in acyclic alkanes, transforming them into mixtures of higher and lower homologues.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by:
1. Competition between reagents for active sites
2. Relative rates of reaction for different intermediates
3. Partial pressures of reactants, which affect the concentrations of surface species

While the document doesn't provide detailed information on the specific processes for cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, it suggests that the mechanism can be extended to other alkane conversions.

The catalyst shows some deactivation over time, which can be mitigated by the presence of hydrogen. This implies that the formation of unsaturated surface species may play a role in catalyst deactivation.

Overall, this system represents a novel approach to C-C bond formation from alkanes, demonstrating the potential for cross-metathesis between sp3 and sp2 carbon centers, albeit with modest catalytic performance.

          由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物[(·SiO)2TaH]催化的烷烃复分解全面机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：反应始于反应物（如乙烷和甲苯）中C-H键的活化，导致分子氢的释放。这一步骤涉及不同反应物之间以及分子内不同类型C-H键之间的竞争。

2. 中间体形成：C-H活化导致各种钽络合物的形成，包括钽-乙基[(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5]、钽-苄基[(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5]和钽-甲基苯基[(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3]物种。

3. 与烷烃反应：这些中间体络合物随后与烷烃分子（如乙烷）反应，产生新的烷烃（如丙烷）和芳香族产物（如乙苯、二甲苯），同时形成钽-甲基中间体。

4. 活性物种再生：催化循环通过烷烃或芳香族分子置换钽上的甲基基团来完成，重新生成关键的中间体络合物。

该机理似乎遵循单位点方案，因为没有明确提到双位点过程。反应涉及非环烷烃中C-C键的断裂和形成，将它们转化为高级和低级同系物的混合物。

催化剂的选择性和性能受以下因素影响：
1. 试剂之间对活性位点的竞争
2. 不同中间体的相对反应速率
3. 反应物的分压，这影响表面物种的浓度

虽然文档没有提供关于环状烷烃转化的具体过程或烯烃和金属环丁烷形成的详细信息，但它暗示该机理可以扩展到其他烷烃转化。

催化剂随时间显示出一些失活，这可以通过氢气的存在来缓解。这意味着不饱和表面物种的形成可能在催化剂失活中起作用。

总的来说，该系统代表了从烷烃形成C-C键的新方法，展示了sp3和sp2碳中心之间进行交叉复分解的潜力，尽管催化性能较为一般。
