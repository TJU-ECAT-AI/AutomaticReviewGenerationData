[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."

[3] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[4] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[5] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. CH bond activation: The reaction begins with CH bond activation, releasing molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reagents and different types of CH bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The CH activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalum-ethyl, tantalum-benzyl, and tantalum-methylphenyl species.

3. Reaction with alkanes: These intermediates then react with alkane molecules (e.g., ethane) to produce new alkanes (e.g., propane) or aromatic compounds (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes), while forming a tantalum-methyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The tantalum-methyl intermediate reacts with either an alkane or aromatic molecule to regenerate the key intermediates, completing the catalytic cycle.

The mechanism appears to follow a one-site scheme, as there is no explicit mention of a two-site process. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by the relative rates of formation and reaction of the different tantalum intermediates.

For linear alkanes, the process involves cleavage and formation of sp3 C-C bonds, resulting in a mixture of higher and lower homologues. The document does not provide specific information about cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes as intermediates.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are affected by factors such as the partial pressures of reactants, which influence the relative concentrations of surface species and the competition between self-metathesis and cross-metathesis reactions.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解反应机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. CH键活化：反应始于CH键的活化，释放出分子氢。这一步骤涉及不同反应物之间以及分子内不同类型CH键之间的竞争。

2. 中间体的形成：CH活化导致各种钽络合物的形成，包括钽-乙基、钽-苄基和钽-甲基苯基物种。

3. 与烷烃的反应：这些中间体然后与烷烃分子（如乙烷）反应，生成新的烷烃（如丙烷）或芳香族化合物（如乙苯、二甲苯），同时形成钽-甲基中间体。

4. 活性物种的再生：钽-甲基中间体与烷烃或芳香族分子反应，重新生成关键中间体，完成催化循环。

该机理似乎遵循单位点方案，因为没有明确提到双位点过程。催化剂的选择性和性能受不同钽中间体的形成和反应相对速率的影响。

对于线性烷烃，该过程涉及sp3 C-C键的断裂和形成，产生高级和低级同系物的混合物。该文件没有提供关于环烷烃转化或烯烃和金属环丁烷作为中间体形成的具体信息。

反应选择性和催化剂性能受到诸如反应物分压等因素的影响，这些因素影响表面物种的相对浓度以及自身复分解和交叉复分解反应之间的竞争。
