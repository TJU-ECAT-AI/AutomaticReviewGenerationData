[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[3] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[4] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. CH bond activation: The reaction begins with CH bond activation, releasing molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reagents and different types of CH bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The CH activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalumethyl, benzyl, and methylphenyl species.

3. Reaction with alkanes: These intermediate complexes then react with alkane molecules (e.g., ethane) to produce new alkanes and aromatic compounds, while forming a tantalummethyl intermediate.

4. Selectivity determination: The kinetics of the reaction between the various intermediates and the alkane molecules governs the final product selectivity.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The final step involves the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an alkane or aromatic molecule, regenerating the key intermediates.

The document does not explicitly discuss two-site versus one-site schemes or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. However, the mechanism described suggests a one-site scheme, where reactions occur at a single tantalum center.

The formation of higher and lower homologues in acyclic alkane metathesis indicates that both C-C bond cleavage and formation occur. The selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as partial pressures of reagents, which affect the relative concentrations of surface species.

While the document focuses on the cross-metathesis between ethane and toluene, it suggests that the mechanism can be extended to other alkane conversions. The catalyst shows modest performance, with some deactivation over time, which can be mitigated by the presence of hydrogen.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. CH键活化：反应始于CH键活化，释放分子氢。这一步骤涉及不同试剂之间以及分子内不同类型CH键之间的竞争。

2. 中间体形成：CH活化导致各种钽络合物的形成，包括钽甲基、苄基和甲基苯基物种。

3. 与烷烃反应：这些中间体络合物随后与烷烃分子（如乙烷）反应，产生新的烷烃和芳香族化合物，同时形成钽甲基中间体。

4. 选择性确定：各种中间体与烷烃分子之间反应的动力学决定了最终的产物选择性。

5. 催化剂再生：最后一步涉及烷烃或芳香族分子置换钽上的甲基基团，再生关键中间体。

文档没有明确讨论双位点与单位点方案，或烯烃和金属杂环丁烷的形成。然而，所描述的机理暗示了一个单位点方案，即反应在单个钽中心发生。

非环烷烃复分解中高级和低级同系物的形成表明C-C键的断裂和形成都会发生。选择性和催化剂性能受到诸如试剂分压等因素的影响，这些因素影响表面物种的相对浓度。

虽然文档主要关注乙烷和甲苯之间的交叉复分解，但它表明该机理可以扩展到其他烷烃转化。催化剂表现出适度的性能，随时间有一些失活，这可以通过氢气的存在来缓解。
