[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[3] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[4] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. CH bond activation: The reaction begins with CH bond activation, releasing molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reagents and different types of CH bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The CH activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalumethyl, benzyl, and methylphenyl species.

3. Reaction with alkanes: These intermediate complexes then react with alkane molecules (e.g., ethane) to produce new alkanes and aromatic products while forming a tantalummethyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The final step involves the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an alkane or aromatic molecule, regenerating the key intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by:

1. Competition between reagents for active sites
2. Relative rates of reaction for different intermediates
3. Partial pressures of reactants, which affect the concentrations of surface species

The document does not provide detailed information on two-site vs one-site schemes, the specific processes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations, or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The mechanism described appears to be primarily a one-site scheme focused on the transformation of acyclic alkanes and aromatic compounds.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. CH键活化：反应始于CH键活化，释放分子氢。这一步骤涉及不同试剂之间以及分子内不同类型CH键之间的竞争。

2. 中间体的形成：CH活化导致各种钽络合物的形成，包括钽甲基、苄基和甲基苯基物种。

3. 与烷烃反应：这些中间络合物然后与烷烃分子（如乙烷）反应，产生新的烷烃和芳香族产物，同时形成钽甲基中间体。

4. 活性物种的再生：最后一步涉及烷烃或芳香族分子置换钽上的甲基基团，重新生成关键中间体。

催化剂的选择性和性能受以下因素影响：

1. 试剂之间对活性位点的竞争
2. 不同中间体的相对反应速率
3. 反应物的分压，这影响表面物种的浓度

文档没有提供关于双位点与单位点方案、线性和环状烷烃转化的具体过程，或烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成的详细信息。所描述的机理主要似乎是一个单位点方案，专注于非环烷烃和芳香族化合物的转化。
