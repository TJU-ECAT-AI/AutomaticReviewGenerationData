[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."

[3] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[4] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[5] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in the reactants (e.g., ethane and toluene), resulting in the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different types of C-H bonds.

2. Formation of intermediates: The C-H activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalumethyl, benzyl, and methylphenyl species.

3. Reaction with ethane: These intermediates then react with ethane molecules to produce products like propane, ethylbenzene, or xylenes, while forming a tantalummethyl intermediate.

4. Product selectivity: The kinetics of the reaction between the different intermediates and ethane governs the final product distribution.

5. Regeneration of active species: The catalytic cycle is completed by the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either ethane or toluene, regenerating the key intermediates.

The mechanism appears to follow a one-site scheme, as there is no explicit mention of a two-site process. The formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes is not directly discussed in the given literature, suggesting that this particular system may operate through a different mechanistic pathway compared to traditional olefin metathesis catalysts.

The selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by factors such as the relative concentrations of surface species, which depend on the partial pressures of the reactants. Higher ethane pressure favors self-metathesis of ethane, while higher toluene pressure promotes cross-metathesis products.

The catalyst shows some deactivation over time, which can be mitigated by the presence of hydrogen. This suggests that the formation of unsaturated surface species may play a role in catalyst deactivation.

Overall, this system represents a novel approach to C-C bond formation from alkanes, demonstrating the potential for cross-metathesis between sp3 and sp2 carbon centers, albeit with modest catalytic performance.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：反应始于反应物（如乙烷和甲苯）中C-H键的活化，导致分子氢的释放。这一步骤涉及不同类型C-H键之间的竞争。

2. 中间体的形成：C-H活化导致各种钽络合物的形成，包括钽甲基、苄基和甲基苯基物种。

3. 与乙烷反应：这些中间体随后与乙烷分子反应，生成丙烷、乙苯或二甲苯等产物，同时形成钽甲基中间体。

4. 产物选择性：不同中间体与乙烷反应的动力学决定了最终产物分布。

5. 活性物种的再生：催化循环通过乙烷或甲苯置换钽上的甲基基团来完成，重新生成关键中间体。

该机理似乎遵循单位点方案，因为没有明确提到双位点过程。文献中没有直接讨论烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成，这表明该特定系统可能通过与传统烯烃复分解催化剂不同的机理途径运作。

选择性和催化剂性能受到诸如表面物种相对浓度等因素的影响，这些浓度取决于反应物的分压。较高的乙烷压力有利于乙烷的自身复分解，而较高的甲苯压力促进交叉复分解产物的形成。

催化剂随时间显示出一些失活，这可以通过氢气的存在来缓解。这表明不饱和表面物种的形成可能在催化剂失活中起作用。

总的来说，该系统代表了一种从烷烃形成C-C键的新方法，展示了sp3和sp2碳中心之间交叉复分解的潜力，尽管催化性能较为一般。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(·SiO)2TaH] involves several key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in the reactants (e.g., ethane and toluene), releasing molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reactants and different types of C-H bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The C-H activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalum-ethyl, tantalum-benzyl, and tantalum-methylphenyl species.

3. Reaction with ethane: These intermediate complexes then react with ethane molecules, producing products like propane, ethylbenzene, or xylenes, while forming a tantalum-methyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The final step involves the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either ethane or toluene, regenerating the key intermediate complexes.

The mechanism involves both cleavage and formation of C-C bonds in acyclic alkanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are governed by the kinetics of the reactions between the various intermediates and ethane. While the document doesn't explicitly discuss two-site versus one-site mechanisms or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, it suggests a single-site mechanism where the tantalum center undergoes successive transformations.

The reaction can produce both linear and branched products, as evidenced by the formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes. The catalyst performance is affected by factors such as partial pressures of reactants, which influence the relative concentrations of surface species and thus the selectivity towards different products.

This mechanism represents a novel approach to C-C bond formation from alkanes, which is a challenging area in organic synthesis. The ability to perform cross-metathesis between an alkane (ethane) and an aromatic compound (toluene) is particularly noteworthy.

4. 活性物种再生：最后一步涉及乙烷或甲苯取代钽上的甲基基团，重新生成关键的中间体络合物。

该机理涉及非环烷烃中C-C键的断裂和形成。催化剂的选择性和性能由各种中间体与乙烷之间反应的动力学决定。虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点与单位点机制或烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成，但它暗示了一个单位点机制，其中钽中心经历连续的转变。

反应可以产生直链和支链产物，这从乙苯和二甲苯的形成可以看出。催化剂性能受到反应物分压等因素的影响，这些因素影响表面物种的相对浓度，从而影响不同产物的选择性。

这种机制代表了从烷烃形成C-C键的新方法，这在有机合成中是一个具有挑战性的领域。特别值得注意的是，它能够在烷烃（乙烷）和芳香族化合物（甲苯）之间进行交叉复分解反应。
