[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."

[3] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[4] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[5] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(·SiO)2TaH] involves several key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in the reactants (e.g., ethane and toluene), releasing molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reactants and different types of C-H bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The C-H activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalum-ethyl, tantalum-benzyl, and tantalum-methylphenyl species.

3. Reaction with ethane: These intermediate complexes then react with ethane molecules, producing products like propane, ethylbenzene, or xylenes, while forming a tantalum-methyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The final step involves the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either ethane or toluene, regenerating the key intermediate complexes.

The mechanism involves both cleavage and formation of C-C bonds in acyclic alkanes. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are governed by the kinetics of the reactions between the various intermediates and ethane. While the document doesn't explicitly discuss two-site versus one-site mechanisms or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, it suggests a single-site mechanism where the tantalum center undergoes successive transformations.

The reaction can produce both linear and branched products, as evidenced by the formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes. The catalyst performance is affected by factors such as partial pressures of reactants, which influence the relative concentrations of surface species and thus the selectivity towards different products.

This mechanism represents a novel approach to C-C bond formation from alkanes, which is a challenging area in organic synthesis. The ability to perform cross-metathesis between an alkane (ethane) and an aromatic compound (toluene) is particularly noteworthy.

以二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物[(·SiO)2TaH]催化的烷烃复分解反应机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：反应从反应物（如乙烷和甲苯）中C-H键的活化开始，释放出分子氢。这一步骤涉及不同反应物之间以及分子内不同类型C-H键之间的竞争。

2. 中间体形成：C-H活化导致各种钽络合物的形成，包括钽-乙基、钽-苄基和钽-甲基苯基物种。

3. 与乙烷反应：这些中间体络合物然后与乙烷分子反应，产生丙烷、乙苯或二甲苯等产物，同时形成钽-甲基中间体。

4. 活性物种再生：最后一步涉及乙烷或甲苯取代钽上的甲基基团，重新生成关键的中间体络合物。

该机理涉及非环烷烃中C-C键的断裂和形成。催化剂的选择性和性能由各种中间体与乙烷之间反应的动力学决定。虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点与单位点机制或烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成，但它暗示了一个单位点机制，其中钽中心经历连续的转变。

反应可以产生直链和支链产物，这从乙苯和二甲苯的形成可以看出。催化剂性能受到反应物分压等因素的影响，这些因素影响表面物种的相对浓度，从而影响不同产物的选择性。

这种机制代表了从烷烃形成C-C键的新方法，这在有机合成中是一个具有挑战性的领域。特别值得注意的是，它能够在烷烃（乙烷）和芳香族化合物（甲苯）之间进行交叉复分解反应。
