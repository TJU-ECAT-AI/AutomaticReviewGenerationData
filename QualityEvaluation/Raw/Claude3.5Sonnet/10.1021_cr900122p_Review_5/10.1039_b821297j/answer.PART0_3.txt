<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document primarily discusses tin-containing zeolites and their Lewis acid properties, as well as their catalytic activity in various reactions such as Baeyer-Villiger oxidation and cyclization of citronellal. There is no mention of tantalum hydrides or alkane metathesis mechanisms. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
