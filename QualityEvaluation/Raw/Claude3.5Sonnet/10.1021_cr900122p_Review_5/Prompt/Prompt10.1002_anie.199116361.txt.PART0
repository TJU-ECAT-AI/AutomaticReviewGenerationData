Methyltrioxorhenium as Catalyst for 
Olefin Metathesis ** 
By Wolfgang A .  Herrmann,* Werner Wagner, 
Uwe N .  Flessner, Ursula Volkhardt, and Hartmut Komber 
Dedicated to Professor Karl Heinz Biichel 
on the occasion of his 60th birthday 
Methyltrioxorhenium (MTO, CH,ReO,) is the most easi- 
ly accessible organometal oxide. It is prepared from dirheni- 
um heptaoxide and tetramethyltin, may be conveniently pu- 
rified by vacuum sublimation, is stable far above its melting 
point (m.p. 106"C), dissolves in all organic solvents andwa- 
ter without decomposition, and is stable to air and acid.['' In 
addition to these advantageous properties, MTO has excep- 
tional catalyst qualities which we describe in this and the two 
subsequent communications.

The olefin metathesis is a reaction catalyzed by organo- 
metallic compounds, and its significance for the synthesis of 
basic and fine-chemical olefins as well as of polymers (poly- 
alkenamers) is steadily increasing.t2331 
Variants, including 
both homogeneous and heterogenous catalysis, are presently 
used in eight technical p r o c e s  e s , [       
but the metathesis of 
functionalized olefins still presents problems (e.g., high cata- 
lyst concentrations, catalyst poisoning). In these cases cocat- 
alysts (preferably alkyltin compounds) are essential, even for 
the more active systems (e.g. Re,0,/A1,0,).[2-41 
We have now discovered that the title compound MTO 
(la) and higher homologues (RReO,, R = alkyl, aryl) on 
acidic metal oxide supports form metathesis catalysts that 
are active without additives even for functionalized 
ole fin.] The K complexes 1 
b, c and the N-complex 1 
d are, 
however, not suitable. The standard system MTO/Al,O,-

ied. It catalyzes in particular the self-metathesis of ally1 
halides, ethers, silanes, and unsaturated carboxylates and ni- 
triles, but also the ethenolysis of olefins with internal double 
bonds (Table 1). Catalyst I operates at room temperature

when the considerably higher maximum rhenium charge of 
about 10 wt % is employed. 
ESCA) of reduced species (ReV1, 
ReV) 
might be catalytically 
relevant. 
2) MTO loses maximally 5% of the organic groups as 
methane and ethylene on the preparation of catalyst I. Use 
of CD,ReO, (>99% D) confirmed the participation of 
metal-coordinated CD, groups in olefin metathesis (forma- 
tion of CD,=CHC,H, and CD,=CH, from l-butene). 
3) Free MTO cannot be separated from the carrier even 
under high vacuum at temperatures up to 150C. At higher 
temperatures decomposition accompanied by predominant- 
ly methane and ethylene evolution is observed. MTO can 
also not be removed from the carrier by solvents. We assume 
that MTO is fixed by condensation reactions such as that 
represented in the model equation (a).[]

The condensation reaction increases the Lewis acidity of 
the rhenium, as is shown by solid state IR spectroscopy 
(diffuse reflectance):[ the asymmetric Re0 stretching 
band of catalyst I is shifted by up to 25 cm- to shorter 
wavelength relative to that of free MTO. This electronic 
change at the central atom is also reflected in the increased 
moisture sensitivity of catalyst I. Although free MTO is rel- 
atively stable in water and acid, the system MTO/AI,O,- 
SiO, is rapidly decomposed on hydrated surfaces to methane, 
ethylene, and perrhenate (GC, IR). Perrhenate bonded to the 
surface has been detected for the system Re,O,/AI,O, 
.[I 
MTO is also suitable for use in homogeneous catalyst 
systems for olefins that have no functional groups. Thus, the 
system MTO/R,AICI,-n (

,
 R = 
CH,, C,H,; n = 1, 2) is 
very efficient for the metathesis of 2-pentene at room tem- 
perature; equilibrium is achieved in less than 5 min (Re: 
olefin = 1 
:loo). 
Furthermore, ring-opening polymerization is catalyzed by 
the homogeneous catalyst 1
1
,
 as shown by the example of 
norbornene and some derivatives. Within minutes at room 
temperature polynorbornene of high molecular weight and 
medium polydispersity is formed [Equation (b) and Table 21.

for activation tet act."). 
The special catalyst activity of MTO is lost when the 
methyl groups are cleaved. To avoid this degradationldeacti- 
vation reaction (which forms methane!), thermally pretreat- 
ed carriers are required.l6] Besides A120,-containing sys- 
tems, Nb,O, is suitable.r81 
Usually the catalyst loading rates 
are 1-3 wt% (ca.13 g MTO per kg). 
The following picture of the nature and mechanism of the 
MTO/Al,O,-SiO, system has been formed from physical 
studies of 900 metathesis experiments: 
1) ESCA studies reveal that the metal oxidation state (Re) 
is largely maintained on impregnation of the oxide support. 
Nevertheless, a very small proportion (not quantifiable by 
The products are very soluble and have a high proportion of 
cis-configurated moieties (up to 84%, Table2). The cis- 
stereoselectivity can be controlled by the rhenium/cocatalyst 
ratio: an increase in the organoaluminum component yields 
a polymer with a higher proportion of trans-configuration. 
However, an eightfold excess of the cocatalyst causes low 
molecular weight products and insoluble 
polymers to form.[ 
21 
Because practically all metathesis catalysts are based on 
oxides or halides of molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium, 
MTO introduces-after 30 years of research in this fieldr2]- 
a new generation of structurally defined catalysts. Even 
though the mechanism (metal-carbene formation from 
MTO) has not been finally elucidated, the multifarious ap- 
plications of the catalyst are already convincing. Still more 
important is the possibility of a designed catalyst optimiza- 
tion by variation of the alkyl groups on the metal. The activ- 
ity and stability of the classical olefin metathesis catalyst

Experimental Procedure 
MTO as heterogeneous catalyst: MTO (la, 1.25 g, 5.0 mmol) was dissolved in 
50 mL of CH,CI, and added to a well-stirred suspension of the carrier material 
(161, 13Og in 500 mL of CH,CI,). 
Metathesis of I-hexene: CH,CI, (24.5 mL) was added to 1 
% of this contact 
suspension (3 wt % Re) in a lOOmL round-bottomed flask fitted with a nitrogen 
inlet and a reflux condenser. The mixture was treated with I-hexene (5mL, 
40 mmo1;'Re:olefin = 1 
:800). The system was kept under slight positive pres- 
sure of dry nitrogen by means of a mercury check valve. (If the reaction was 
carried out under reflux to drive off the evolving ethylene, 93 
% of the initial 
olefin was converted after 30 min.) After fractional microdistillation of the 
reaction mixture 5-decene was isolated as cis/trans mixture. Yield: 2.0 g (77 
%). 
Cometathesis 
of methyl oleate and ethylene: CH,Cl, (35 mL) and methyl oleate 
(1.7 mL, 5 mmol) were added to 1% of the contact suspension (Re: olefin = 
1:lOO) in a l0OOmL laboratory glass autoclave and pressurized with 7 bar 
ethylene. After 2 h at room temperature 27% of the starting material had 
reacted (see Table 1).

was added a solution of norbornene (1.2 g, 12.5 mmol) in 10 
mL of chloroben- 
zene (Re:Al:olefin = 1:4:500). No starting material could be detected after 
30 min. The reaction was stopped with 20 mL of methanol. A white polymer

Methyltrioxorhenium as Catalyst for 
Olefin Oxidation** 
By Wovgang A .  Herrmann,* Richard W Fischer, 
and Dieter W Marz 
Dedicated to Professor Karl Heinz Biichel 
on the occasion ofhis 60th birthday 
The oxides of the neighboring elements of rhenium are 
active catalysts for olefin oxidation.['] They depend, how- 
ever, on different mechanisms for their activity: With hydro- 
gen peroxide, molybdenum and tungsten oxides form "inor- 
ganic peroxides" of type L,M-OOH, which have proved to 
be efficient epoxidation agents. Osmium tetroxide reacts 
with olefins cis-stereoselectively-in 
stoichiometric and cat- 
alytic processes-to 
yield vicinal diols, which are formed 
via structurally defined osmate esters.['**' However, no

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
