Heterogeneously catalyzed reactions constitute the 
basis of most chemical and fuel technologies. The 
conversion of hydrocarbons in particular is at the heart 
of the refining of crude oil, the modification of fat in 
food industries, and the synthesis of pharmaceutical 
products and fine chemicals. Unfortunately, since 
catalytic processes are generally quite complex, little 
is known about the individual steps that take place at 
the molecular level in such systems. It is only recently 
that the advent of a variety of modern surface-sensitive 
instrumentation has made those studies feasib1e;l the 
power of using such techniques in elucidating reaction 
mechanisms has been shown already in several key 
 case., 
In spite of the recent technological advances men- 
tioned above, the details of the processes involved in 
the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons are still not 
well understood. The activation of those compounds 
is believed to occur through an initial C-H bond scission 
step that results in the formation of alkyl groups on the 
surface. However, since that reaction often displays 
quite low probabilities, catalytic processes need to be 
performed under fairly severe prmsure and temperature 
conditions in order to reach reasonable conversion rates. 
High pressures are not easy to reproduce in the vacuum 
environments normally used in surface science studies, 
and in addition, they tend to accelerate the conversion 
of alkyl groups into other species, making the steady- 
state concentration of those intermediates on the cat- 
alyst surface too low to be detected. 
Several approaches have been taken in order to ov- 
ercome the difficulties mentioned above. One way to 
make C-H bond breaking reactions easier under vacu- 
um is by using open surfaces with low-coordination 
metal atoms, because those sites tend to display higher 
reativity. 
Alternatively, supersonic beams can be 
used to deliver gas molecules having the high energies 
needed for their ativation.? 
However, even though 
studies based on these ideas have yielded very exciting 
results, they have proven less than general for inves- 
tigating the surface chemistry of hydrocarbons on 
surfaces. 
Recent studies in my laboratory and a few others 
have shown the feasibility of yet another method for 
preparing chemisorbed alkyl groups, namely, by disso-

ciating alkyl halides adsorbed on surfaces. It is well- 
known that alkyl radicals can be efficiently prepared 
in either gas or liquid phases by activating suitable 
precursors such as alkyl halides, azo compounds, and 
 peroxide. Alkyl halides are particularly good can- 
didates for studies on surfaces because they are easy to 
prepare and to handle under vacuum and because they 
have already been shown to undergo oxidative addition 
reactions in solution to form organometallic products 
with alkyl ligands attached directly 
to the metal center.8 
Over the past few years we have characterized the 
chemisorption and reactivity of alkyl halides on tran- 
sition metals using a combination of modern surface- 
sensitive techniques on well-defined single crystals. In 
this account we summarize what we have learned so far 
from those studies. 
Experimental Considerations 
Surface reactions are now routinely studied under 
ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (UHV, 10-'o-lO-ll Torr) 
in order both to facilitate the use of electron- and ion- 
based spectroscopies and to keep the sample clean from 
contaminanb. M.any surface-sensitive

Chemisorption of Alkyl Halides 
The chemisorption of alkyl halides has already been 
studied on a wide variety of surfaces (Table I). The 
experimental data available so far indicates that ad- 
sorption at low temperatures is molecular. Three main 
pieces of evidence support that conclusion: First, de- 
sorption of intact molecules can be thermally driven 
from most surfaces even at coverages below saturation; 
second, 
ion bombardment of those surfaces at low tem- 
peratures yields secondary ions with molecular stoi- 
chiometry; and finally, the vibrational spectra of the 
chemisorbed species are quite similar to those of the 
original molecules. 
The adsorption geometry of adsorbed alkyl halides 
has 
also been studied in some detail. XPS experiments 
indicate that bonding to the surface occurs through the 
halogen end of the molecule: the binding energies of 
electrons associated with the halide atom shift by up 
to 1 
eV upon chemisorption while the values for the C 
1s electrons remain u n a f f e  t e d . '         
In addition, the 
molecular axes of the hydrocarbon fragments change 
orientation in going from below to above h

by the RAIRS spectra of ethyl bromide adsorbed on 
Pt(ll1)

 while at low coverages, the 
methyl groups are oriented parallel to the surface; 
they 
rearrange to a perpendicular 
configuration upon further 
exposure. Similar results have been obtained for other 
systems.233W43

perpendicular 
to the surface are infrared active, we conclude 
that 
a flat geometxy prevails at low coverages and that a rearrangement 
takes place around half saturation where the methyl group axes 
become perpendicular to the surface. 
Formation of Surface Alkyl Groups 
The carbon-halogen bond in alkyl halides adsorbed 
on metal surfaces can be broken easily either thermally 
or photolytically. The photochemistry 
of these systems 
has been studied in detail by Professor White at the 
University of Texas, Austin;@ 
he has found that the 
C-X bond can be dissociated on surfaces by exposing 
them to ultraviolet light of lower energy than that 
needed in the gas phase. Thermal activation is equally 
effective in driving this step: the energy required to 
break the C-I bond on Ni(100) surfaces was measured 
to be less t

Our method is based on the fact that the signal

the chemical environment surrounding 
the iodine atom: the l-eV peak shift seen between 200 and 240 K (from 620.3 to

temperature range. In addition, RAIRS allows for the identification of the species formed on the surface. The right panel displays

been observed in solution.45 These reactions follow on 
surfaces trends similar to those in the gas phase, that 
is, the ease with which the bond breaks increases in 
going from chlorine to iodine. For instance, methyl 
chloride decomposes only over iron or tungsten surfaces 
while desorbing molecularly from silver, copper, plati- 
num, palladium, or nickel substrates; methyl bromide 
does react on nickel but not on silver or platinum; and 
methyl iodide dissociates on all single-crystal 
surfaces 
studied to date. In addition, ethyl and propyl iodides 
have also been shown to dissociate on silver, copper, 
platinum, and nickel surfaces. It has been found that 
in general the early transition metals are the most active 
for carbon-halogen bond scission and that alkyl iodides 
are the best candidates for the thermal production of 
hydrocarbon moieties on a given metal surface. 
The initial carbon-halogen bond dissociation in alkyl 
halides leads to the formation of chemisorbed alkyl 
moieties. Figure 2 exemplifies the occurrence of that 
reaction for the case of iodomethane adsorbed on Pt- 
(111): 
the 13d 
XPS data shown in the left frame in- 
dicate that the C-I bond breaks between 200 and 240 
K, and the right panel displays infrared spectra showing 
that such a reaction produces methyl moieties on the 
surface.24 Similar data were used to prove that ethyl 
groups are formed after ethyl iodide activation as 
well.42943 
Surface Reactivity of Alkyl Groups 
Surface alkyl groups can undergo further transfor- 
mations at higher temperatures by following a series of 
dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, H-D exchange, and 
polymerization reactions. Dehydrogenation steps are 
evidenced by the substantial desorption of hydrogen 
that is always detected in TPD experiments. This de-

(45) Rogers, H. R.; Hill, C. L.; Fujiwara, Y.; Rogers, R. J.; Mitchell, H. 
sorption usually takes place in several stages, which 
means that the hydrogen losses from those alkyl 
moieties may occur in a stepwise fashion and that 
several stable intermediates may be formed on the 
surface at different temperatures. For instance, the 
vibrational data obtained from the thermal activation 
of methyl iodide on Pt(ll1) 
indicate that methyl groups 
are converted into methylene between 240 and 280 K 
(Figure 2)?' Moreover, TPD experiments have shown 
that while the hydrogen produced by that reaction 
desorbs around 330 K (in a desorption-limited step), the 
rest comes off above 500 K, suggesting 
that methylene 
moieties are stable over a wide range of temperatures. 
On Ni(100), 
on the other hand, hydrogen desorption is 
complete by 380 K, which makes the isolation of surface 
species other than methyl groups very diffiu1t.l 
The mechanism for the dehydrogenation of ethyl 
groups is more complex than in the case of methyl 
moieties because 
of the existence of two different 
carbon 
atoms within each molecule. Hz TPD spectra from 
ethyl iodide on Pt(ll1) 
indicate that two stable species 
with CzH4 and CzH3 stoichiometries 
are formed around 
270 and 300 K, respectively (Figure 3, top), and TPD 
data from partially labeled molecules clearly show that 
the fmt dehydrogenation step occum at the methyl end 
of the ethyl groups and results in the formation of ad- 
sorbed ethylene (Figure 3, b o t t  m ) .     ?    
Such @-hy- 
drogen elimination is in fact well-known in organo- 
metallic chemistry and has also been shown to be the 
preferred dehydrogenation pathway for longer alkyl 
chains on surfaces.1631 
A fraction of the olefins resulting 
from this reaction desorb at higher temperatures while 
the rest undergo further dehydrogenation in the same 
way as 
if the alkenes were dosed on the surface directly 
from the gas  h a s e .

spectra from ethyl iodide adsorbed on Pt(ll1). The top frame 
shows that the dehydrogenation of ethyl groups takes place in 
three main temperature regimes: first, a hydrogen atom is lost

the RAIRS 
spectrum for ethylidyne prepared from 
ethyl iodide is almost identical to that recorded from 
adsorbed ethylene (Figure 4). Also,

density,

in the spectra shown in Figure 4 leads to 
the conclusion that iodine does not modify the metal 
reactivity toward hydrocarbon conversion significantly; 
it only blocks some of the chemisorption sites on the 
surface. 
The thermal desorption of hydrogenation products 
is also quite common in these alkyl halide systems: the 
yield for methane formation amounts to about 75% of 
the methyl iodide initially chemisorbed on Pt(111)% 
and 
to close to 50% in the case of Ni(100),15 and significant 
although smaller numbers are obtained in experiments 
with ethyl iodide.22 
Hydrogenation reactions proceed 
via the direct incorporation of hydrogen atoms into 
adsorbed alkyl groups as 
in the reductive elimination 
proceases commonly seen in organometallic 
compounds. 
Labeling experiments have shown that the required 
surface hydrogen originates from the alkyl dehydroge-

characteristic of ethylidyne. However, the signal inteneities in 
the case of ethyl iodide are about half of those obtained from 
adsorbing ethylene 
because of the lower saturation coveragea in 
the former awe. There are a few other subtle differences in peak 
shapes between the two spectra, but the striking similarities 
observed point to the conclusion that iodine atom codeposited 
during ethyl iodide decomposition do not alter the electronic 
structure of the metal surface significantly: the chemistry seen 
for adsorbed ethylene produced by ethyl iodide decomposition 
is the same as 
that reported from direct adsorption of gas-phase 
ethylene.

of saturation; at lower concentrations 
only dehydrogenation takes place on the  u r f a c e .   *    
Hydrogenation reactions can be enhanced selectively 
by predosing the surface with hydrogen: coadsorbing 
small amounts of hydrogen with methyl iodide on either 
Ni(100) or Pt(ll1) 
surfaces results in methane yields 
close to 100% 
,15*50951 
and over a 4-fold increase in ethane 
formation can be achieved by similar hydrogen treat- 
menta for ethyl iodide on Pt(lll).47 
These increases in 
yield are also 
accompanied by a reduction in the energy 
barrier for this reaction, a change that becomes ap- 
parent by shifts in the TPD peaks to lower tempera- 
tures. One of the best examples for this behavior is 
provided by results from methane thermal desorption 
from saturation coverages of methyl iodide on Pt(lll), 
where the main 300 
K TPD peak is entirely replaced 
by a new feature at 275 K upon hydrogen predoing. 
Alkyl moieties chemisorbed on transition metal sur- 
faces may undergo extensive H-D exchange before 
desorbing. For instance, TPD spectra from either 
CH3CD21 
or CD3CH21 on Pt(ll1) show that about 
2530% of the ethylene that desorbs around 300 
K 
(after @hydrogen 
elimination) has experienced at least 
one hydrogen or deuterium substitution.4' These 
reaulta 
have been explained by the occurrence of a series of 
ethylene-ethyl interconversion steps on the surface 
similar 
to those observed for hydrogen coadsorbed with

multiple and rapid interconversion steps among methyl, methylene, and methylidyne moieties on the surface.

of reactions involving C1

surface 
moieties adsorbed on Pt(ll1). 
Shown are the heats of formation for the relevant surface 
species (right hand side scale) 
as 
well as 
the kinetic activation barriers for 
the corresponding interconversion steps. One general conclusion derived from this diagram is that most species are about equally 
stable on the surface, so the direction in which the reactions involving those intermediates may go depends mostly on the energetics 
of surface hydrogen formation. This suggests that pressure, not temperature, 
may be the key parameter that controls reaction selectivites 
in many catalytic hydrocarbon conversion processes. 
exchange on alkyl groups can be enhanced by hydro- 
gen/deuterium predosing. The most dramatic example 
for this comes from our recent studies on the coad- 
sorption of methyl iodide with deuterium over Pt(lll), 
where we have seen that about one-quarter of the de- 
sorbing methane consists of molecules with at 
least one 
deuterium substitution and that the formation of 
multiply exchanged molecules is clearly favored over 
the formation of the monosubstituted product (Figure 
5).50951955 
The product distributions in these TPD ex- 
periments, which are similar to those obtained from 
studies on the catalytic H-D exchange of methane, re- 
quire the formation of at least three surface interme- 
diates: we have proposed a mechanism that includes 
the formation of methyl, methylene, and methylidyne

moieties where the last two species equilibrate rapidly 
with the hydrogen and deuterium atoms adsorbed on 
the s  r f a c e ?  ,    
To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first time that reversible hydrogenation-dehydro- 
genation reactions have been observed in hydrocarbons 
adsorbed on single-crystal surfaces under vacuum, a 
result that proves that alkyl groups generated by the 
dissociation of alkyl halides can be used to model cat- 
alytic processes which take place under atmospheric 
conditions. 
TPD experiments have also been used to estimate 
kinetic parameters for hydrocarbon conversion reactions 
on transition metal;'999*

Alkyl Groups Adsorbed on Metal Surfaces 
and thermodynamic data obtained for C1 
and C2 
moieties on Pt(ll1) 
surfaces. The heats of formation 
for methyl and ethyl groups on this surface are within 
3 kcal/mol of each other, which means that the met- 
al-carbon bond energies are similar in both cases (on 
the order of 30 kcal/mol). However, the activation 
barriers for the interconversion between methane and 
methyl groups are quite a bit higher than those for the 
ethane-ethyl pair, a difference of about 10 kcal/mol. 
On the other side of the diagram we see that the deh- 
ydrogenation of alkyl groups on platinum requires en- 
ergies of about 6
-
8
 kcal/mol, a little less for @-hydrogen 
elimination than for C-H 
dissociation in the a 
position. 
The remaining hydrocarbon fragments (methylene, 
methylidyne, ethylene) are almost equally stable, so 
their interconversion is mainly regulated by the ener- 
getics of hydrogen adsorption. This is an important 
conclusion for catalysis, because it implies that product 
selectivities 
may be better controlled by changing the 
pressures of the reactants rather than the reaction 
temperature. 
Finally, dimerization 
products have been reported to 
form from methyl halides on Ru(100),I1 
Pd(lW),l4 
Cu- 
(110),31 
and foils of other transition metals,40 
as 
well as 
from ethyl and propyl moieties on Ag(111).34*35 
These 
carbon-carbon bond formation reactions are responsible 
for the production of hydrocarbons in Fischel-Tropsch 
catalytic processes. 
Concluding 
Remarks 
We have shown here that alkyl halides chemisorb 
molecularly on transition metal surfaces at low tem- 
peratures and that the scission of the carbon-halogen 
bond can be easily activated either thermally or pho- 
tolytically to yield adsorbed alkyl moieties. The sub- 
sequent thermal chemistry of those surface interme- 
diates is quite complex even in the most simple cases 
because it involves a series of hydrogenation-dehydro- 
genation, H-D exchange, and polymerization steps.

Additionally, 
coadsorbing hydrogen or deuterium with 
alkyl halides has been shown to be a good way of sim- 
ulating catalytic hydrocarbon conversion reactions un- 
der vacuum. 
The use of alkyl halides as precursors for alkyl for- 
mation on surfaces is in its infancy.

proven 
to be an exciting method for custom-making adsorbed 
hydrocarbon intermediates otherwise inaccessible for 
surface science studies, but a systematic characteriza- 
tion of these systems is still needed in order to learn 
more about the general trends in hydrocarbon chem- 
istry on metal surfaces. Furthermore, the extension of 
this methodology to the synthesis of other hydrocarbon 
groups such as 
methylene, vinyl, and allyl species should 
also be explored. 
In spite of the positive outlook given above, we should 
also search for alternative techniques to prepare hy- 
drocarbon fragments on surfaces which avoid the in- 
herent inconveniences due to the codeposition of hal- 
ogen atoms in alkyl halide decomposition. The use of 
other radical precursors should be studied in detail. Azo 
compounds are excellent candidates for this purpose 
because they dissociate into alkyl radicals and nitrogen 
molecules: given that nitrogen desorbs molecularly 
from most transition metals, clean hydrocarbon over- 
layers are likely to form on the surface. The few studies 
done to date using this approach have provided mixed 
r e  u l t s .      
Hydrocarbon radicals could also be made 
in the gas phase and then dosed on metal surfaces; 
this 
method is at present completely new.61 Finally, we are 
investigating the possibility of delivering hydrocarbon 
moieties using low-energy gas-phase carbonium ions.
