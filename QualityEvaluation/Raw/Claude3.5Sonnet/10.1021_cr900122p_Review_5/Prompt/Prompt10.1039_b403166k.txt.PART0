The silica-supported tantalum hydride [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 cata-
lyzes at moderate temperature (150250 C) the cross-met-
athesis reaction between toluene and ethane, to form mainly
ethylbenzene and xylenes.
We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum
hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane
metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of
higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1)).2

where i = 1, 2,n 2 1, but with i = 1 generally favoured.
This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the
(sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin. Herein we report the
cross metathesis reaction between ethane and toluene which leads
to the simultaneous formation of ethylbenzene and xylenes
(eqn.(2)).
(2)
In the case of ethylbenzene, the reaction proceeds via a cross s-
bond metathesis between the (sp3)CH bond of the aromatic methyl
and the (sp3)C(sp3)C bond of ethane; in the case of xylenes, it
occurs via a cross s-bond metathesis between the (sp2)CH bonds
of the aromatic ring and the (sp3)C(sp3)C of ethane. To our
knowledge, although s-bond metathesis is known between molec-
ular lutetium,3 thorium4 or scandium5 hydrides, alkyls or aryls and
alkanes or aromatics, it is the first example of such catalytic cross
metathesis reactions.
The following experiment illustrates these two new catalytic
reactions. When a (3.7/97.6) molar mixture of toluene and ethane
was heated in the presence of 1 (50 mg; 5 wt% Ta), at 250 C, under
atmospheric pressure in a batch reactor (300 ml), besides methane,
propane and butanes arising from the self-metathesis of ethane,2
ethylbenzene but also the various xylenes were produced.
Ethylbenzene and xylenes can arise from the cross-metathesis
between toluene and ethane (eqn. (2)) but also from the self
metathesis of toluene (eqn. (3)) although they have not been
evidenced during blank experiments
(3)
In order to further discriminate between the two hypotheses (eqn.
(2) or eqn. (3)), 100% a-13C enriched toluene was allowed to react
with ethane at 250 C, in the presence of 1. Under these conditions,
ethylbenzene was obtained, mainly 13C-mono-labeled in the a-
position (92%), while xylenes were 98% 13C-mono-labeled.6 Thus,
ethylbenzene and xylenes turn out to form mainly through the
cross-metathesis process depicted in eqn. (2).
Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a C
H bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This
activation step involves a competition between the two reagents,
e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH
bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the
aromatic ring (Scheme 1).
This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5],
benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2Ta
C6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by
13C CP MAS NMR.7 In a second step, these complexes would then
undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate
propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tanta-
lummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the
reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final
selectivity of the different products. The last step common to all
cycles is the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by
either an ethane or a toluene molecule to regenerate the key
intermediates: the tantalumethyl, benzyl or methylphenyl
complexes.
This system was further investigated in a continuous flow
reactor. When a (3.7/97.6) mixture of toluene and ethane (flow rate
of 3 ml min21) was passed over a catalytic bed of [(·SiO)2TaH] 1
(420 mg; 4.6 wt% Ta) at 250 C, methane, propane and butanes

were again produced as well as ethylbenzene and xylenes but also
n- and iso-propylbenzenes, resulting reasonably from a double
methyl addition to the CH3 group of toluene (Table 1, entry 1).8 The
conversions of ethane and toluene decreased during the first period
of time on stream to reach after 60 h in a pseudo steady state, values
of 0.05 and 0.25% respectively. According to the number of
turnovers (TON), the reaction proves slightly catalytic affording
after 100 h a production of 1.7 mol of ethylbenzene per mol of
Ta.
When 10% of H2 was introduced in the gas flow under 101.3 kPa
at 250 C (Table 1, entry 2), the deactivation was reduced
suggesting that this process may involve the dehydrogenation of
some surface species towards unsaturated ones.9 Indeed at the
steady state, the turnover frequencies (TOF) of ethane {0.13 h21
(with H2) instead of 0.049 h21 (without H2)} and toluene {0.07 h21
(with H2) instead of 0.013 h21 (without H2} were improved.
Therefore, in the presence of H2, a better TON of toluene and a
better production of ethylbenzene (3.3 mol per mol of Ta) were
obtained.10 However, a certain amount of methylcyclohexane
(10.5%), benzene (7.7%) and cyclohexane (2.5%) was also
observed, resulting from hydrogenation and/or hydrogenolysis
processes.
When for a given pressure of toluene (3.7 kPa), the pressure of
ethane was progressively increased from 97.6 kPa to 2.53103 kPa
(Table 1, entries 1, 3, 4, 5), self-metathesis of ethane was favoured
at the expense of cross-metathesis and the deactivation process was
slowed down; indeed the resulting TON of ethane at 60 h, increased
while that of toluene decreased as well as all the selectivities of
aromatic compounds. However, the production of ethylbenzene
increased slightly at 103 kPa (2.9 mol per mol of Ta) compared to
atmospheric pressure (1.7 mol per mol of Ta). These data are
consistent with the relative dependence of the surface species
concentration on the partial pressures of both reagents as depicted
in Scheme 1. As the pressure of ethane increases, formation of
[(·SiO)2TaCH2CH3] is favoured at the expense of [(·SiO)2Ta
CH2C6H5] and [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] and thereby self-metathesis
of ethane is favoured at the expense of cross-metathesis. Con-
versely, when the partial pressure of toluene was increased (Table
1, entries 6 and 7), the respective concentrations of [(·SiO)2Ta
CH2C6H5] and [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] were increased. The TON of
toluene increased and the self-metathesis of ethane decreased
accordingly. Thus a higher yield of ethylbenzene (6 mol per mol of
Ta) was obtained after 100 h under the conditions of entry 7.
In conclusion, we have shown the possibility of performing a
cross-metathesis reaction between toluene and ethane catalyzed by
a tantalum hydride supported on silica [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 which is the
first example of such a reaction; it leads to ethylbenzene and
xylenes and constitutes a new example of a slightly catalytic
reaction in the difficult field of CC bond formation from alkanes
where examples remain rare.11 Moreover, the formation of xylenes
represents the first case of a metathesis reaction between an
aromatic (sp2)CH and a (sp3)C(sp3)C bond. Finally, although its
performance remains modest, this reaction can be compared with
the FriedelCrafts alkylation of benzene with ethylene12 which is
currently used to manufacture ethylbenzene.

species supposed to be less or non active, could be evidenced on the used
catalyst; their formation could be limited by the presence of H2.
