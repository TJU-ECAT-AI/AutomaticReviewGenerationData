I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Sr2MgMoO6-d exhibits a lower ha compared to
Sr2MnMoO6-d. The dependence of ha on the
current density agrees well with that of the power
density in Fig. 2. In addition, in most of the cases
we observed, ha is lower than the corresponding
cathode overpotential, hc. Here, LSCM exhibits
a large ha in H2 and especially in H2/H2S, which
shows that SMMO gives a superior performance.
Because the LDC buffer layer is also an
MIEC that is catalytically active for fuel oxi-
dation, a cell with only the LDC layer as anode
and with Pt mesh and Pt paste as current
collector was tested. The values of Pmax were
528 and only 27 mW/cm2 in dry H2 and CH4,
respectively, much lower than those of a cell
with Sr2MgMoO6-d as anode. Furthermore,
EDS results for the Sr2MgMoO6-d/LDC/LSGM/
SCF cell after operating in H2, H2/H2S, and
CH4 for a total of 10 days showed no Pt in the
LDC layer. This result demonstrates that the
high performance of our cells with SMMO as
anode was not dominated by the LDC layer.
We further tried to use Au mesh and Au paste
as the current collector. A drop in Pmax oc-
curred because of Au melting and a possible
formation of Au-Mg alloy (21). In addition,
because the Sr2MgMoO6-d anode was poisoned
by the existence of Au, the activity in CH4 be-
came very poor, which could not be improved by
sputtering Pt on the anode surface. Instead, the
observation reinforces the conclusion that SMMO
plays an important catalytic role in oxidation of
CH4. We note that Pt paste is also catalytic for
CH4 oxidation. However, even without Pt paste,
the Sr2MgMoO6-d anode with buried Pt mesh
as current collector still showed a Pmax of 340
mW/cm2 at 800-C in dry CH4.
With a 300-mm-thick LSGM electrolyte and
SCF as the cathode, the double-perovskite an-
odes that we investigated show a high power den-
sity and a stable performance on power cycling.
Moreover, they exhibit an excellent tolerance to
sulfur. Sr2MgMoO6-d also shows a very high
power density in dry methane. Our results are
also applicable to YSZ as electrolyte. These
preliminary results indicate that optimization of
the chemistry and the morphology of these
double perovskites can provide an anode mate-
rial for a SOFC that operates on natural gas.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
