Tuning the Selectivity of Alumina-Supported (CH3)ReO3 by Modifying the Surface Properties of the Support
Graphical Abstract
Supported metathesis: Grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto alumina covered with surface trimethylsilyl groups increases the efficiency and selectivity of this catalyst in olefin metathesis (see scheme). The SiMe3 groups (X) modify the adsorption properties of alumina by favoring desorption and thereby disfavoring secondary reactions.
Olefin metathesis has become a key reaction for basic and fine chemical synthesis.13 However, despite years of research and tremendous advances in this field, it is still difficult to control the stereochemical outcome of this reaction, which leads to mixture of (E) and (Z)isomers.47 In fact, one of the difficulties arises from competing secondary (Z)(E)isomerization. This reaction is catalyzed by the same catalyst and involves the same reaction (metathesis) and mechanism (Scheme1), therefore the products will always eventually equilibrate into a thermodynamic mixture.

Examples of productive propene metathesis and isomerization in propene metathesis: a)Formation of 2-butenes by productive propene metathesis; b)(Z)-2-butene isomerization by degenerate metathesis.
Some homogeneous catalysts, however, are highly stereoselective and can maintain this high stereoselectivity at high conversions.8 In the case of heterogeneous catalysts, and especially those supported on alumina, the thermodynamic ratio of 2-butenes (E/Z=3:1 at 25C) is usually observed for the metathesis of propene even under continuous flow conditions. To observe the kinetic product ratio, it is necessary to use very high flow rates and to work at very low conversions9,10 because the strong adsorption of olefins on alumina favors secondary isomerization (degenerate metathesis).11 Herein we show that grafting (CH3)ReO3 onto an alumina12 whose surface has been previously modified with trimethylsilyl fragments (Scheme2) leads to an improved activity as well as a (Z)-selective catalyst for the metathesis of propene.10

Synthesis of 1. a)Reaction of AllylTMS with alumina surface hydroxy groups. b)Grafting of (CH3)ReO3 onto the reactive sites of unmodified or modified alumina supports.
IR spectroscopy: γ-Al2O3-(500) was contacted with allyltrimethylsilane (AllylTMS) at room temperature under static vacuum. After 13h, residual AllylTMS was removed under vacuum for 5h at 25C. The IR spectrum of the product (Figure1ad) shows two bands at 2958 and 2901cm1 arising from symmetric and asymmetric ν(CH3) absorptions along with two bands at 1400 and 1258cm1 assigned to δ(CH3) absorptions. Almost half of the original AlOH bands disappear during this step. Further treatment with AllylTMS at 65C nearly doubles the number of grafted species, and the residual AlOH bands are replaced by a weak and broad band centered at 3673cm1. This band probably corresponds to OH groups in new environments, such as in interactions with Al-O-Si(CH3)3 surface species.13 No major changes are observed upon further treatment of the sample with AllylTMS at 150C.

The grafting of both AllylTMS and (CH3)ReO3 onto γ-Al2O3-(500), as monitored by IR spectroscopy: a)γ-Al2O3-(500) after calcination and treatment at 500C under vacuum (105torr); b)+AllylTMS/13h at 25C/5h at 105torr; c)+AllylTMS/13h at 65C/5h at 105torr; d)+AllylTMS/13h at 150C/5h at 105torr; e)after sublimation of (CH3)ReO3 onto the modified γ-Al2O3-(500) and desorption; f) after evacuation at 105torr for 2h.
Acidity measurements with pyridine1416 showed that most of the stronger Lewis acid sites had been consumed and that the weaker ones had only been partially consumed (see FigureS1 in the Supporting Information). Overall, these experimental data are consistent with a reaction of AllylTMS with the hydroxy groups of alumina to give trimethylsilyl surface species (Scheme1a).17
In a second step, (CH3)ReO3 was sublimed at room temperature onto this modified γ-Al2O3-(500) partially covered by surface OSi(CH3)3 groups. The solid turned deep red. The IR spectrum of this material (Figures1e and 1f) shows two bands at 2958 and 2901cm1 arising from the symmetric and asymmetric ν(CH3) absorptions, along with three other bands at 1400, 1258, and 1205cm1 assigned to δ(CH3) absorptions. The band at 1205cm1 corresponds to the methyl group of (CH3)ReO3. Moreover, the original AlOH bands have been replaced by a broad band centered at 3570cm1 (spanning between 3750 and 3300cm1), which probably corresponds to OH groups interacting with (CH3)ReO3, as previously observed for (CH3)ReO3 grafted onto Al2O3.18 The appearance of these new OH groups could also be due to the formation of new AlS-OH species resulting from CH bond activation of the methyl group of (CH3)ReO3 on surface defects, in other words reactive AlS-O-AlS species (Scheme1b; AlS corresponds to surface Al sites).
Mass balance analysis: γ-Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 contains 1.4Si atoms per square nanometer (0.70.1wt% according to elemental analysis), which corresponds to the reaction of about 32% of the surface OH groups of γ-Al2O3-(500) (4OH groups per square nanometer). Partial consumption of the OH groups has already been detected by IR spectroscopy (Figure1ad). This reflects the different reactivity of the various OH groups present on γ-Al2O3-(500), as observed previously during the grafting of Zr(CH2tBu)4 and W(CtBu)(CH2tBu)3.19 Propene formation was also detected (by GC analysis) during grafting although the amount formed was not quantified, thereby confirming the reaction between AllylTMS and the hydroxyl groups of alumina.17 The solid obtained after reaction with (CH3)ReO3, namely (CH3)ReO3/Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 (1), contains around 0.9Re atoms per square nanometer (2.80.1wt% of Re), which is close to the Si surface density reported above. It should be noted, however, that the Re surface coverage in 1 is slightly lower than that obtained for (CH3)ReO3/γ-Al2O3-(500) (2; 1.1Re atoms per square nanometer), which is in agreement with the consumption of some AlSOAlS reactive sites during the reaction with AllylTMS (see above).
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy: The 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) solid-state NMR spectrum of Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 displays one intense signal at δ=0ppm associated with the formation of [AlS-O-Si(CH3)3] surface species (Figure2a and Scheme2). The absence of olefinic carbon atoms is consistent with cleavage of the allylic moiety during grafting, as proposed for grafting onto silica.17 When 100% 13C-labeled (CH3)ReO3 is sublimed onto Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3, other signals are also observed for (CH3)ReO3/γ-Al2O3-(500) along with the signal at δ=0ppm associated with [AlS-O-Si(CH3)3], (Figure2b).18 For example, a weak signal at δ=67ppm can be attributed to [AlSCH2ReO3], which results from CH bond activation of the methyl ligand of (CH3)ReO3 on the truncated Al sites of the alumina surface, along with three other signals at δ=32, 22, and 11ppm, which correspond to (CH3)ReO3 coordinated to various surface Lewis acid sites of alumina through its oxo ligands (Scheme2b).18

A CP step of 2ms was used. b)13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR spectrum of 13C-labeled (CH3)ReO3 on γ-Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 (spinning frequency: 10kHz).

Active site of (CH3)ReO3 supported on γ-Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 (1): When (CH3)ReO3/γ-Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 (1) is treated with 0.61equivalents of doubly 13C labeled ethene, 11% of singly labeled ethene is detected, in other words 0.06equivalents per Re (6% of active sites). This result shows that some active sites originate from the methyl group of (CH3)ReO3 as in the original (CH3)ReO3/γ-Al2O3-(500) (2),18 but that there are less of them (6% versus 15% for 1 and 2, respectively). This is probably due to the presence of fewer defect sites on γ-Al2O3-(500) after grafting the silylating agents. Furthermore, the solid-state 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of 1 after treatment with 0.61equivalents of 100% doubly 13C labeled ethene displays a large and intense signal at δ=66ppm, a weaker signal at δ=31ppm, and three sharp signals at δ=30, 20, and 0.6ppm (see FigureS2 in the Supporting Information). No carbenic signal is detected between δ=150 and 400ppm. The two signals at δ=30 and 20ppm can be assigned to ethene oligomers formed on alumina acid sites.18,20 It should be noted, however, that those oligomers are present in a lesser amount and that no physisorbed olefin is observed, in contrast to what has been observed for γ-Al2O3-(500) alone or 2. This observation is in agreement with the weaker acidity of 1. Similarly, the signal at δ=66ppm in 1, which has been assigned to [AlSCH2ReO3] species,18 is weaker than the signal observed for 2 (Scheme3).

Metathetical exchange at the active site of (CH3)ReO3/γ-Al2O3-(500)-Si(CH3)3 (1).
Activity, selectivity, and stability as a function of time on stream: At 30C and a flow rate of 34.5mLmin1 (142mol(molRe)1min1), propene is transformed into a mixture of ethene and 2-butenes with an initial rate after 6min of 21mol of propene transformed per mol of Re per minute (see FigureS3 in the Supporting Information). Over 7800min, the turnover number (TON) reaches 23500, while the conversion decreases from 14.5% to 0.5%, thereby showing that catalyst 1 is rapidly deactivated. The initial rate and the cumulative number of turnovers (at 7800min) per active site can be estimated from the initial number of active sites (approx. 6%)a rare possibility in heterogeneous catalysisto be 350mol of propene transformed per mol of active sites per minute and 330000, respectively (see FigureS4 in the Supporting Information), which is far better than all currently known rhenium-based catalysts, including the well-defined silica-supported Re system (approx. 6000).21 Moreover, catalyst 1 displays a very high selectivity for 2-butenes, particularly for (Z)-2-butene (1-butene: <1×104%; isobutene: approx. 0.003%), and does not give a thermodynamic ratio of 2-butenes even at rather high conversions (approx. 10%), in contrast to most alumina-supported catalysts (including 2; Figure3). The E/Z ratio increases nearly linearly with conversion and thereby with respect to the partial pressure of (Z)-2-butene (PC4Z is proportional to conversion) for 1, while catalyst 2 displays a hyperbolic-like dependence of the E/Z ratio as a function of conversion or (Z)-2-butene partial pressure.

The above observation is consistent with the two solids having different adsorption properties. While describing the exact analytical expression for the rates would be complex and beyond the scope of this discussion (competition between the adsorption of gases, equilibrium), it is possible to express the rate of Z to E isomerization of 2-butenes when far from equilibrium as risom=kisomθC4Z, where the surface coverage is expressed according to Langmuir and Hinshelwood as θn=λnPn/(1+λiPi) (for a gas n in a mixture of i gases, where Pi is the partial pressure of the gas i and λi the equilibrium constant of adsorption for i). Combining these two equations gives risom=kisomθC4Z=kisomλC4ZPC4Z/(1+λiPi). For a catalyst with low adsorption properties (λiPi1), risom=kisomθC4Z=kisomλC4ZPC4Z (linear dependence, as observed for 1), while for a catalyst with stronger adsorption properties risom=kisomθC4Z=kisomλC4ZPC4Z/(1+λiPi) (hyperbolic dependence, as observed for 2). These two equations indicate that the adsorption properties of the solid can indeed dramatically alter the overall performance of a catalyst (e.g. activity, stereoselectivity). For the alumina-supported system 2, it is therefore necessary to use a very high inverse space velocity (flow rates and low conversion) to reach high Z selectivity and obtain the kinetic ratio because of the high adsorption of the support.11,14,15 A direct consequence of this is the lower (Z)-2-butene selectivity for 2 than for 1. Another less obvious consequence, however, is the higher initial activity of 1 (TOF=350 versus 185mol of propene transformed per mol of active sites per minute for 1 and 2, respectively). This activity is not due to 1 having more efficient active sites perse (they are the same, as shown by NMR spectroscopy), but to a difference of adsorption properties between the two catalysts: catalyst 1 converts propene more rapidly because the products can desorb, while catalyst 2 isomerizes the products strongly adsorbed on the surface in a metathesis reaction that competes with the productive propene metathesis (Scheme1).
In conclusion, modifying an alumina surface with trimethylsilyl groups has a drastic effect on the selectivity and activity of the catalytic system.22 The trimethylsilyl groups change the adsorption properties of alumina by favoring desorption and thereby disfavoring secondary reactions. This system appears to be very promising, and we are currently investigating ways to obtain a single-site system based on (CH3)ReO3 and modified oxide surfaces which could, in principle, allow highly efficient catalysts to be obtained.
