However, after binding of the streptavidin the reflectivity curves looked

7 and - 
1, 
this offers opportunities to fine tune the physico-chemical 
properties of zeolite encapsulated molecular forms of rheni- 
um oxide. 
An ideal molecular precursor with which to achieve this 
goal would be a small, volatile and stable species, for which 
methyltrioxorhenium(vI1) , CH,ReO, (denoted MTO) , 
is a 
potentially interesting candidate. This material has been 
demonstrated to have excellent homogeneous and heteroge- 
neous catalytic properties in, for example, the metathesis and 
oxidation of ole fin.[] In aqueous acid media MTO has been 
shown to aggregate to (MTO),.[41 
At a pressure of 150 bar 
this material undergoes an interesting depolymerization re- 
action to regenerate MTO.I4] This material is found to be 
highly conductive, with a structure that is based on layers of 
six coordinate pseudo-octahedral ReV" 
bilding-blocks.[] 
In 
this communication we describe the successful encapsula- 
tion, structural characterization, thermal and chemical sta- 
bility of MTO in both the sodium and acid forms of dehy- 
drated zeolite Y 
Encapsulation experiments were conducted with the es- 
sentially fully sodium ion, rubidium ion and proton ex- 
changed forms of dehydrated M,,Y, where M represents the 
extraframework cations."] To ensure rigorously water-free 
conditions, freshly sublimed MTO was dried in situ over 
phosphorus pentoxide and/or dehydrated potassium zeolite 
A and then directly resublimed into a self-supporting wafer 
of the zeolite host. Quantitative gravimetric experiments es- 
tablish that at a loading level corresponding to four mole- 
cules of MTO per supercage, it is not possible to thermally 
vacuum desorb the guest molecules from these zeolite hosts. 
PXRD studies of these samples demonstrates that the 
crystallinity of the zeolite host is maintained and there is 
essentially no change in the dimensions of the unit cell. Mid- 
IR studies of (MTO),,H,,Y 
show complete loss of su- 
percage protons (3643 cm- ') together with the proportional 
growth of a broad structureless, bathochromically shifted 
band centered around 3250 cm- ' 
(Fig. 1). 
Diagnostic vCH 
stretching and 6CH deformation modes for acid zeolite Y 
encapsulated and bulkL5] 
MTO are observed at 2990, 2900, 
1365 cm-' and 2984,2899,1363 cm-', respectively (Fig. 1). 
These observations indicate a homogeneous distribution 
of supercage confined MTO, hydrogen-bonded to the 
Brcansted acid sites. Methane evolution was not observed 
under these conditions, which is in contrast to the observed 
reactivity and framework anchoring chemistry of (CH,),Cd 
and (CH,),Sn in H56Y[61 
The strong electron-withdrawing 
character of the ReO, group in MTOr5] 
is likely responsible 
for the reduced nucleophilic properties of the methyl group 
and lack of methane evolution from the reaction with 
Brransted protons. 
The mid-IR spectrum of (MTO),,Na,,Y displays charac- 
teristic vCH 
stretching and 6CH deformation bands at 2986, 
2899, 1364 cm-'. The minimal perturbation of the vCH

Consistent with the proposed hydrogen-bonding an- 
choring scheme, is the observed red-shift of the vReO 
stretching mode from its value of 947 cm-' in bulk MTOL5] 
to around 865 cm-' when occluded in H,,Y We presume 
that the anchoring interaction of MTO with the NaQ 
cations 
in Na,,Y is weaker, as this vReO stretching mode remains 
obscured by the intense zeolite framework vSiO/A10 stretch- 
ing modes absorbing above 900 cm-'. 
The 'H and I3C-MAS 
NMR chemical shifts observed for 
MTO encapsulated in Na,,Y (3.2, 24.8 ppm) fall between 
the corresponding values reported for bulk MTO (4.1, 
32.6ppm) and MTO dissolved in polar solvents (2.2-2.6, 
19.0 ppni).[51 
The MAS NMR line widths for the anchored 
MTO (1 
120,450 Hz) are reduced by about a factor of about 
three relative to those of bulk MTO. These results imply that 
MTO is mobile in Na,,Y and that it is either undergoing 
exchange between different Na' anchoring sites or motion 
at its anchoring site. 
A Re L,,,-edge EXAFS structure analysis, of bulk MTO as 
well as (MTO),,Na,,Y at 120 K (the fitting procedure uti- 
lized W0,20 and ReO, reference data) shows that the encap- 
sulated MTO guest retains its structural integrity, with no 
significant perturbations to its bond lengths compared to 
those of bulk MTO (ReC = 
2.06kO.l A, Re0 =1.74* 
0.03 A). The corresponding values for gaseous MTO are 
ReC = 2.060 A and Re0 = 
1.709 
No outer shell scat- 
tering associated other Re coordination shells was observed 
(Fig. 2). Similarly, the Re L,,, and Rb K edge EXAFS results 
for MTO in Rb,,Y confirm that the structural integrity of 
MTO is retained and show no evidence for a well defined

existence of either static or dynamic disorder of MTO about

ture. Within a few hours, the (MTO),,Rb,,Y sample passes 
from white to beige. By contrast the (MTO),,Na,,Y sample, 
transforms from white to brick-red in a few days. Similar but 
less intense color effects are noticed even for low loading 
(lMTO/u.c.) samples. Mild cooling to -20 "C essentially 
quenches these color changes and gentle annealing to around 
80 "C accelerates the process. Under these conditions it is 
important to note that there is no evidence for the produc- 
tion of CH,, H,O, CO or CO,. Control experiments demon- 
strate that these coloration effects are not caused by expo- 
sure to either air, water or oxygen. In fact, even brief contact 
with air completely reverses these color changes. The mid-IR 
and EXAFS results of these materials, before and after these 
color changes have ensued, reveal that the MTO guests have 
retained their chemical identity. 
XPS investigations of freshly prepared and annealed sam- 
ples of (MTO),,Na,,Y 
clearly signal that the MTO guests 
are internally confined (correspondence between the surface 
and bulk elemental analysis, with evidence for some surface 
depletion, probably originating from the XPS ultrahigh 
vacuum environment and exposure to the X-ray source) and

A graphical illustration of a supercage encapsulated and 
anchored (MTO), tetrameric cluster is shown in Figure 4. 
EXAFS analysis shows that exposure of these aggregated 
(MTO),,Na,,Y samples to air or water, which as mentioned 
above removes the coloration, also leaves the MTO guests 
intact. It appears that solvation of Na@ 
cations and MTO by 
water, could be responsible for de-anchoring and de-aggre- 
gation of the proposed (MTO), assembly. 
In view of the fact that bulk MTO is colorless, one is 
forced to the conclusion that the new visible absorption ob- 
served for zeolite Y encapsulated MTO molecules originates 
from extraframework cation induced aggregation and en- 
hanced intermolecular interactions between MTO guests. In 
essence one can view the high Lewis acidity and intense elec- 
tric fields associated with the supercage cations or Brernsted 
protons, as being responsible for the creation of an "intra- 
zeolite nanoscale cluster" version of the aforementioned 
bulk polymeric layered form of (MTO),, the latter also being 
formed by acid treatment of MT0.[41 
Curiously, it is the 
application of pressure that depolymerizes the bulk form of 
(MTO),[41 
while it is adsorbed water that accomplishes the 
analogous function for the agglomerated form of zeolite Y 
encapsulated (MTO), . 
The thermal properties of (MTO),,Na,,Y have been in- 
vestigated at temperatures above the 80 "C annealing tem- 
perature. It was discovered that CH, in the gas phase and 
H,O in the zeolite host are the dominant products above 
120 
"C. Evolution of these species occurred concomitantly 
with the depletion of the MTO guests. Quantification of the 
evolved methane was achieved by mid-IR spectroscopy. 
These studies demonstrate that this intrazeolite process is 
complete at 220 "C and that only between 0.8 and 1 
.O CH, 
per supercage are produced from this loading sample. At this 
stage of the thermal treatment the samples are completely 
black. EXAFS analysis reveals the growth of a species that 
contains ReRe bonds with a bond length of 2.59 8, com- 
mencing at about 120 
"C. 
In summary, the combined results of this study demon- 
strate that, at room temperature, four intact MTO molecules 
can either hydrogen-bond to Brmsted acid sites or interact 
with extraframework cationic sites in the supercages of 
M,,Y, where M = H, Na, Rb. The favored anchoring inter-

In Situ X-Ray Diffraction Evidence of Guest 
Molecule Reorientation During an Intercalation 
Reaction 
By John S. 0. 
Evans, Stephen Burlow, Heng-Vee Wong 
and Dermot O'Hure* 
The intercalation of inorganic, organic and organometal- 
lic molecules or ions into lamellar host lattices is now a 
widely recognized phenomenon.['] The resulting materials 
have now been shown to exhibit some remarkable proper- 
ties; for example in the fields of superconductivity,"] cooper- 
ative magnetism,['] non-linear optics,['] and shape-selective 
absorption and recgnition.] 
However, our understanding 
of the kinetic and mechanistic details of these reactions is 
extremely limited. This has been largely due to the technical 
difficulties in performing real-time monitoring of heteroge- 
neous reactions. Recently we have been developing tech- 
niques for studying reactions of this type using in situ energy 
dispersive X-ray diffraction.[41 
The intercalation of Mo(Mes), {Mes = @-C,H,Me,} in- 
to ZrS, has been previously reported to give the lamellar 
intercalate ZrS,{Mo(Mes),},,,,

in the interlayer separation (Ac) of 5.78 A, together with 
calculated van der Waals dimensions of the guest molecule 
and lattice expansions of the host lattice were used to infer 
that this sandwich molecule adopts an orientation with its 
principal molecular axis perpendicular to the host lattice 
layers (Fig. 1). 
Fig. 1. A schematic representation of the two possible orientations of 
Mo(Mes), between the layers of ZrS,. The van der Waals surfaces of the guest 
molecules are shown. 
However, our extensive investigations of a large range of 
layered metal dichalcogenide-metallocene intercalates has 
indicated that in all other systems, with the possible excep- 
tion of the cobaltocene intercalates of TaS, (where a mixture 
of guest orientations has been suggested), the preferred ori- 
entation is that with the principal molecular axis parallel to 
the host 
It was therefore decided that the ZrS,/ 
Mo(Mes), system warranted further investigation. 
In an initial series of experiments, intercalation reactions 
were performed by stirring a suspension of ca. 200 mg of the 
host lattice in a solution of ca. 200 mg of Mo(Mes), under a 
nitrogen atmosphere at a variety of temperatures (30- 
150C) in a variety of solvents (principally toluene and 
dimethoxyethane (DME), 5 ml) for periods ranging from 1 
hour to several weeks. Samples were subsequently washed, 
dried in vacuo and their X-ray diffraction patterns recorded 
immediately following work-up. Representative spectra 
from these experiments, and the reaction conditions under 
which each sample was prepared, are shown in Figure 2. 
It can be seen from these data that this intercalation sys- 
tem is considerably more complex than was originally re- 
ported. Figure 2 
b shows the product phase obtained using a 
toluene solvent at 150 
"C. Under these conditions a single 
product phase with an interlayer separation of 11.7 
(20 = 
7.5") is formed, suggesting that the molecules all adopt 
the perpendicular orientation, as originally reported by 
Davies et al. Comparison of Figures 2a and b reveal a fur- 
ther complication in the study of this particular intercalation 
system in that the 002 of the intercalated phase (at 11.7/2 A) 
coincidentally has exactly the same d-spacing as the 001 re- 
flection of the host material; it is therefore often difficult to 
judge the extent of reaction. 
Figure 2c shows the effect of reducing the reaction tem- 
perature to 3 20 "C. Under these conditions the diffraction 
pattern indicates that the intercalated product contain inter- 
layer separations of both 11.7 and 13.6 A (20 =7.5" and
