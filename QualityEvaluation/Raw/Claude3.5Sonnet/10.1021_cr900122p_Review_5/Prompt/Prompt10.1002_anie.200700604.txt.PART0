1. Introduction
Oxidation reactions play an important role in organic
synthesis, and there is currently a demand for more selective
and efficient oxidation methods.[1] Pressure from society has
placed restrictions on industrial oxidation technology, with
emphasis on the need for sustainable and environmentally
friendly processes. Today there is an increasing demand to use
oxidants such as molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide,
which are environmentally friendly and do not give rise to any
waste products. Both of these oxidants fulfill the requirement
of green chemistry.[2]
Molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide have many
advantages and only a few minor disadvantages. The main
advantages are that both of them are environmentally
friendly and show a high efficiency per weight of oxidant.
Compared to hydrogen peroxide, molecular oxygen has the
advantage that it is inexpensive (for example, air can often be
used), but it has the disadvantage that rigorous safety
handling is required for large-scale applications. One advant-
age of H2O2 over O2 that is appreciated by industrial chemists
is that it is a liquid which is miscible with water and is
relatively easy to handle. On the negative side, H2O2 can
undergo radical-induced decomposition to H2O and 1/2O2.
Impurities and traces of metallic particles can induce this
process.
The direct oxidation of organic substrates by either O2 or
H2O2 is rare as the energy barrier for electron transfer from
the organic substrate to the oxidant is usually high. For
molecular oxygen, which has a triplet ground state, this high-
energy barrier is nature-s way of protecting organic com-
pounds from destructive oxidation. Nature has also found
methods to make controlled aerobic oxidations under highly
mild conditions. The unfavorable kinetics associated with
direct aerobic oxidations is circumvented in the respiratory
chain, which is involved in many biological oxidations.[3]
The process is rather complicated and involves several
enzyme complexes containing a variety of redox cofactors
(Scheme 1). The electrons are passed in multistep redox
processes from an energy-rich electron donor to oxygen. For
example, an alcohol is dehydrogenated by NAD+ and the
NADH produced (energy-rich electron donor) is oxidized by
molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant. The redox couple
NAD+/NADH + H+ serves, together with the dehydrogenase
enzyme, as a substrate-selective catalyst in the biological
oxidation. Cytochrome c (a small protein covalently attached
to an iron porphyrin, which is the active redox part) accepts
electrons from complex III and donates them to complex IV
(cytochrome c oxidase), which carries the electrons to molec-
ular oxygen and reduces it to water. The mobile coenzymes
ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) and cytochrome c serve as a link
for the transfer of electrons between the complexes of the
respiratory chain from NADH to molecular oxygen.[4]
For a catalytic oxidation reaction, the substrate-selective
catalyst, which may often be a transition metal (Mn+2/Mn),
oxidizes the substrate to the desired product. The reduced
form of the catalyst is subsequently reoxidized by the
stoichiometric oxidant. From an environmental point of
view, it is desirable that the oxidant is either molecular
oxygen or hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 2).
There are various examples where the metal is directly
reoxidized by O2 or H2O2.[510] Although these direct reox-
idations of the metal give efficient oxidations in many cases,
this approach fails in other cases because the electron transfer
Oxidation reactions are of fundamental importance in nature, and are
key transformations in organic synthesis. The development of new
processes that employ transition metals as substrate-selective catalysts
and stoichiometric environmentally friendly oxidants, such as molec-
ular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, is one of the most important goals
in oxidation chemistry. Direct oxidation of the catalyst by molecular
oxygen or hydrogen peroxide is often kinetically unfavored. The use of
coupled catalytic systems with electron-transfer mediators (ETMs)
usually facilitates the procedures by transporting the electrons from the
catalyst to the oxidant along a low-energy pathway, thereby increasing
the efficiency of the oxidation and thus complementing the direct
oxidation reactions. As a result of the similarities with biological
systems, this can be dubbed a biomimetic approach.

between Mn and O2 or H2O2 is too slow compared to
decomposition of the reduced metal. For example, in
palladium-catalyzed aerobic oxidations, the precipitation of
palladium metal (palladium black) from
soluble palladium species (Pd-H, Pd0) often
competes kinetically with reoxidation by
O2.[5] To circumvent this problem one can
employ ligands that stabilize Pd0 and that
are
stable
under
oxidative
conditions.
Another strategy is to mimic biological
oxidation systems[3] and squeeze in an
electron-transfer mediator (ETM) between
the substrate-selective redox catalyst and
O2 or H2O2 (Scheme 3). This ETM would
then carry the electrons from Mn to the
oxidant along a low-energy pathway which
would compete kinetically with side reac-
tions of the reduced form of the metal
(precipitation, decomposition).
The use of coupled catalytic systems
with ETMs (such as that in Scheme 3) is an
important complement to the simple sys-
tems based on direct reoxidation of the
metal by O2 or H2O2, and significantly
extends the use of oxygen and H2O2 as the final oxidants in
metal-catalyzed reactions. In this Review we will focus on
oxidation reactions where a transition metal is the substrate-
selective catalyst and ETMs are used for the reoxidation of
the metal by O2 or H2O2. We call this a biomimetic approach
because of its similarities to biological systems.
2. Palladium-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation with
ETMs
Palladium-catalyzed oxidations have been studied exten-
sively[11] and aerobic oxidations using palladium catalysts
have, in particular, received much attention in the past
decade. However, as stated above, the direct reoxidation of
palladium by molecular oxygen is difficult in many cases.
There are examples in palladium-catalyzed oxidations where
the palladium is directly reoxidized by O2 without electron-
transfer mediators (ETMs). These examples involve the
oxidation of alcohols to ketones, alkenes to carbonyl com-
pounds,

alkenes.[5,6,10] A notable example of the direct reoxidation of
palladium by molecular oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of
alcohols was reported by Sheldon and co-workers,[10] where a
water-soluble phenanthrolinepalladium(II) complex was used
as the catalyst.
An illustrative example of the principle of using an ETM
is
the
Wacker
oxidation
of
ethylene
to
acetaldehyde
(Scheme 4).[12] This is a large-scale industrial process for the
oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde by air (O2) which is
catalyzed by PdCl2 and CuCl2, with the former being the
substrate-selective redox catalyst.
The reaction between ethylene and palladium chloride in
water was first observed in 1894 by Phillips,[13] who found that
it gave rise to acetaldehyde and palladium black. About
60 years later German researchers at Wacker Chemie found
that CuCl2/CuCl can carry the electrons from Pd0 to
molecular oxygen. The direct reoxidation of Pd0 back to
PdII by molecular oxygen in water is difficult since the energy
barrier is higher than that for catalyst decomposition, that is,
precipitation of Pd black.[14] The facile transfer of electrons
from Pd0 to CuCl2 may be due to a close interaction between
the palladium and copper,[15] and CuCl is known to be readily
oxidized by air to CuCl2 in aqueous solution.[16]
The Wacker process has been extended to the oxidation of
a large variety of alkenes.[11,17] In these reactions, which are
sometimes run in a mixture of a polar solvent and water,
chloride ions are required to stabilize the system and the
combination of PdCl2, CuCl2, and O2 is used. However, the
presence of chloride ions has a negative effect on the rate
(there is an inverse square dependence on the chloride ion
concentration)[18] which makes the reaction unselective and
leads to the formation of chlorinated by-products.[19] The
reactor
also
corrodes
under
the
oxidative
conditions
employed. For this reason a chloride-free Wacker oxidation
is highly desirable, and several methods for the reoxidation of
Pd0 in the absence of chloride ions have been developed.[2022]
For example, the use of palladium acetate together with
benzoquinone and a complex with a macrocyclic ligand Lm
(MLm) as ETMs resulted in a highly efficient chloride-free
Wacker oxidation of terminal alkenes. The best results were
obtained when iron phthalocyanine (Fe(Pc)) was used as the
oxygen-activating complex MLm (Scheme 5).[20] It is essential
that a catalytic amount of strong acid (for example, HClO4) is
present to keep the palladium in solution. A large-scale,
chloride-free Wacker-type process with a polyoxometalate as
the oxygen-activating component has been developed by
Catalytica Inc. (see Scheme 8).[21]
The above-mentioned catalytic system of quinone/MLm
used for the reoxidation of Pd0 by O2 was also applied to the
aerobic 1,4-oxidation of 1,3-dienes (Scheme 6).[20b,23] In this
case, Pd(OAc)2 in acetic acid serves as the substrate-selective
redox catalyst for a conjugated diene, transforming it to a 1,4-
diacetoxy-2-alkene.[24] The ETM, which can be a metal
porphyrin, metal phthalocyanine, or a metalsalen complex,
also serves as the oxygen-activating catalyst of the system.
The MLm catalyst reacts with molecular oxygen to give
M(O2)Lm complexes.
The selection of quinone as the oxidant for the palladium
is based on the fact that quinones are well-known oxidants
and electron carriers in palladium-catalyzed oxidations.[25]
However, under the reaction conditions for the transforma-
tions described in Schemes 5 and 6, it is not possible to
directly reoxidize the hydroquinone formed with molecular
oxygen, and therefore an additional ETM is required. Since
some metal complexes with macrocyclic ligands (metal
macrocycles) are able to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of
catechols and hydroquinones,[26] they have been used in
catalytic amounts in the presence of molecular oxygen to
obtain a successful catalytic system. The success of these
processes is based on a stepwise low-energy electron transfer
that has lower redox potentials, in analogy with that occurring
in biological systems (cf. the respiratory chain). A control

experiment showed that the reaction stops completely if any
of the catalysts (Pd, benzoquinone (BQ), MLm) is removed.
The direct oxidation of palladium(0) by molecular oxygen in
acetic acid is slow under these conditions.[27] On the other
hand, the coupled system in which ETMs are utilized leads to
low-energy electron transfer (Figure 1).
It is also important to point out that there are four
oxidants with decreasing oxidation potentials[28] (O2, (MLm)ox,
BQ, and PdII) and four components that can be oxidized
(MLm, hydroquinone (HQ), Pd0, and diene). Thus, there are
ten thermodynamically favored redox reactions that can
occur, but only four of these are kinetically favored and will
occur. The high kinetic control is due to the fact that there is a
coordination between those redox couples that interact; for
example, O2 coordinates to MLm,[29] HQ binds to the metal
macrocycle,[30] Pd0 is known to coordinate to BQ,[31] and
finally PdII forms a complex with the diene.[20b]
The coupled quinone/metal macrocycle system for the
aerobic reoxidation of palladium(0) to palladium(II) was also
applied to the allylic oxidation of olefins.[20b] The reaction is
efficient and gives a high yield of the allylic acetate in the
aerobic oxidation of cyclohexene [Eq. (1)].
Very recently, an analogous three-component catalyst
system has been applied successfully to the aerobic Pd-
catalyzed oxidative carbocyclization of allene-substituted
olefins [Eq. (2), E = CO2Me].[32] The scope of the reaction
was studied and different cyclic and acyclic alkenes as well as
differently substituted allenes were subjected to the reaction
conditions, and gave the corresponding products in high to
excellent yields (Table 1).
The reaction involves a highly efficient carboncarbon
bond formation under low catalytic loading and aerobic
conditions. There are not many examples of palladium-
catalyzed aerobic oxidations involving CC bond formation
and, in most of them, a high catalytic loading or high oxygen
pressure is required.[6c,33] Here one should also mention the
work by the research groups of Larhed[34] and Jung[35]
concerning the aerobic oxidative Heck reaction, where PdII-
catalyzed CC bond formation occurs under aerobic oxida-
tive conditions in the presence of stabilizing ligands. Reac-
tion (2) can also be carried out with the oxygen-activating
catalyst [Fe(Pc)] immobilized on a resin. It was demonstrated
that the immobilized catalyst can be recycled five times

without any detectable loss of activity, which increases the
utility of the procedure.
A recent application of ETMs is the aerobic oxidation of
methane reported by Bao and co-workers.[36] In this reaction
PdII acts as the substrate-selective catalyst and oxidizes
methane to methyl trifluoroacetate, and the Pd0 formed is
reoxidized by benzoquinone. The hydroquinone formed is
recycled to benzoquinone by NO2/O2. In this application, the
redox couple (MLm)ox/(MLm)red used in the above examples as
the oxygen-activating catalyst is replaced by the redox couple
NO2/NO (Scheme 7).
A similar catalytic system in which the MLm was
substituted for a second transition-metal acetate (Cu, Mn,
or Co) was used for the allylic oxidation of cyclohexenes in
which molecular oxygen was used as the terminal oxidant.[37]
A control experiment in which the palladium salt (Pd(OAc)2)
was omitted gave no reaction. This finding shows that the
second transition metal only serves as an ETM. Recently, this
system was used for the allylic oxidation of limonene under
aerobic conditions.[38]
Polyoxometalates constitute an interesting class of com-
pounds that include hetero-polyacids. Some of these com-
pounds have found use as oxidation catalysts in reactions in
which the stoichiometric oxidant is either hydrogen peroxide
or molecular oxygen.[39] Some transition-metal-substituted
polyoxometalates have been considered to be inorganic
analogues of metalloporphyrins.[40] An industrial process for
the chloride-free Wacker oxidation of alkenes with a hetero-
polyoxometalate as an ETM was developed by Catalytica
(Scheme 8).[21] The system includes a palladium(II) catalyst as
well as a polyoxo acid or polyoxo anion oxidant comprised of
vanadium and dioxygen in contact with aqueous solutions of
the catalyst, and is suitable for a large variety of olefins.
Hetero-polyacids were also used for the activation of
molecular oxygen in place of the metal macrocycle in the PdII/
quinone/MLm system. This three-component catalytic elec-
tron-transfer
system
(PdII/quinone/hetero-polyacids)
was
used for the aerobic 1,4-diacetoxylation of conjugated
dienes and the allylic oxidation of olefins (Scheme 9).[41,42]
A related system in which a molybdovanadophosphate
(NPMoV) and hydroquinone were employed as ETMs for
allylic oxidation was reported independently by Ishii and co-
workers (Scheme 9); some selected examples are presented in
Table 2.[43] The reactivity of the multicatalyst system was
dependent on the ring size of the alkenes: Cyclopentene and
cyclohexene were transformed into the corresponding allylic
acetates in almost quantitative yields, while higher temper-
atures and longer reaction times were required for larger rings
to obtain the products in good yield. It is noteworthy that in
the case of a cyclohexene fused with a cyclopentene ring the
acetoxylation occurs only at the five-membered ring (entry 5).
Omitting hydroquinone from the catalytic system led to low
yields of the acetates. However, in later reports the system
was applied with NPMoV as the sole ETM in a variety of

reactions including the acetalization of alkenes[44] and the
Wacker-type oxidation of cyclopentene,[45] terminal alkenes,
and dienes.[46]
The same authors reported the oxidative carbomethox-
ylation of alkenes using the same catalyst system (Pd/
NPMoV) in methanol and in a carbon monoxide/air atmos-
phere.[47] The reaction proceeds with cyclopentene to give
mixtures of cis-1,2-cyclopentanedicarboxylate and cis-1,3-
cyclopentanedicarboxylate in good yields. Different temper-
atures and CO/air pressures lead to different ratios of the two
isomers. No reaction is observed with cyclohexene, and the
yields are only moderate when other alkenes are employed.
In a later study, the carboxylation of anisole derivatives was
achieved in acetic acid under similar conditions.[48] In this case
the reaction conditions affected the conversion, but the
selectivity and ratio remained constant.
Another polyoxometalate used by Ishii and co-workers in
palladium-catalyzed aerobic reactions is molybdovanado-
phosphoric acid (HPMoV). The direct aerobic oxidative
arylation of acrylates and other electron-deficient olefins
under mild conditions was achieved with this compound
[Eq. (3)].[49] The palladium(0) generated in this oxidative
Heck arylation of the acrylate is reoxidized by the hetero-
polyacid/O2 (the reaction is analogous to that shown in
Scheme 8). Another related application of the same catalyst
system is the oxidative cross-coupling of acrylates with vinyl
carboxylates.[50]
Other three-component catalyst systems related to the
PdII/quinone/hetero-polyacid system have employed CuSO4
instead of the quinone, and this system was applied to the
Wacker oxidation of cyclohexene. In this case, either molec-
ular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide was used as the terminal
oxidant.[51]
The solvent in the original Wacker process is water, which
gives good results for the oxidation of ethylene to acetalde-
hyde under acidic conditions. However, long-chain terminal
olefins show poor solubility in water, and thus results in low
reaction rates, and the presence of acid favors isomerization,
and leads to low selectivity toward methyl ketones.[52] Much
effort has been made to solve this problem, including the use
of surfactants,[53] cyclodextrins,[54] supported catalysts,[55] and
nonclassical solvents such as poly(ethyleneglycol)s,[56] fluo-
rous phases,[57] ionic liquids,[58] and supercritical carbon
dioxide.[59]
The palladium acetate/benzoquinone system has also
been used with hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant.[60]
In this way, alkenes such cyclohexene and 5-decene were
converted cleanly into the corresponding allylic acetates;
however, methyl ketones were obtained with terminal
alkenes. The hydrogen peroxide/hydroquinone system was
also used for the palladium-catalyzed 1,4-diacetoxylation of
1,3-dienes and ring closure of 1,5-dienes.[60]
3. Ruthenium-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation with
ETMs
The dehydrogenation of alcohols to give aldehydes or
ketones by the use of low-valent ruthenium complexes has
been known for more than two decades,[61] and more recently
such complexes have been applied to the dehydrogenation of
amines to give imines.[62] Morton and Cole-Hamilton[61a]
reported that treatment of alcohols such as butanol or
isopropyl alcohol with [RuH2(N2)(PPh3)3] at 1508C in the
presence of NaOH led to dehydrogenation and the produc-
tion of hydrogen gas with high turnovers. Interestingly, the
same ruthenium complexes had been used as hydrogenation
catalysts.[63] More recently, the ruthenium-catalyzed dehydro-
genation of alcohols to give H2 and a ketone has been
reported by Park and co-workers.[64,65] The ability of ruthe-
nium complexes to act as dehydrogenation and hydrogena-
tion catalysts is reflected by their use in hydrogen-transfer
reactions.[66] The principle of these hydrogen-transfer reac-
tions is that the ruthenium dehydrogenates the alcohol and
the ruthenium hydride formed adds to a ketone or an
electron-deficient olefin. One way to develop an aerobic
oxidation system would be to allow the generated ruthenium
hydride to add to benzoquinone. The hydroquinone thus
formed could then be recycled by the MLm/O2 system (see
Schemes 5 and 6).
It was demonstrated that benzoquinone can serve as a
hydrogen acceptor for the ruthenium-catalyzed dehydrogen-
ation of benzyl alcohol: The use of the ruthenium complex
[RuCl2(PPh3)3] (1.2 mol%) as the substrate-selective redox
catalyst in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol by benzoquinone
afforded benzaldehyde in 70% yield (turnover number
(TON) = 58) at room temperature.[67] This oxidation was
combined with a reoxidation system of hydroquinone (see
Schemes 5 and 6) to give an aerobic process for the oxidation
of the alcohol.[67] To obtain good efficiency it was necessary to
employ [RuCl(OAc)(PPh3)3] as the catalyst and to use
Co(salophen) (with a PPh3 ligand) as the oxygen-activating
catalyst. The principle of this biomimetic oxidation is shown
in Scheme 10. With this system, TONs up to 70 were obtained
and the yield of benzaldehyde was 60%. Other primary
alcohols such as geraniol, cinnamyl alcohol, and 2-naphthyl-
methanol were also oxidized to their aldehydes by this system.
The biomimetic catalytic system was extended to the
aerobic oxidation of secondary alcohols.[68] The substrate-

selective redox catalyst used for this transformation was the
dimeric ruthenium catalyst 3, which dissociates to the two
halves 4 and 5.[69] In the preliminary study, 2,6-di(tert-
butyl)benzoquinone was used as the hydrogen acceptor
since p-benzoquinone degraded under the reaction conditions
used for the oxidation of secondary alcohols.[68a] In a
subsequent study, the system was optimized with respect to
the quinone.[68b] Of the various quinones tested, it was found
that 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (6) was the best quinone in
the coupled biomimetic oxidation system in which air was
used as the oxidant (Scheme 11). Thus, the coupled catalytic
system chosen for the aerobic oxidation of secondary alcohols
consists of the binuclear ruthenium complex 3, quinone 6, and
oxygen-activating cobalt complex 7.
It is interesting to note that although 2,6-dimethoxyben-
zoquinone (6) was the optimal quinone for the aerobic
oxidation, chloranil (2,3,5,6-tetrachlorobenzoquinone) was
faster than 6 for the reoxidation of 4 to 5, as shown by running
the oxidation with each of the two quinones as the stoichio-
metric oxidant without 7 and O2. The faster reoxidation of 4 to
5 in the presence of chloranil as the oxidant compared to that
with 6 is expected since the oxidation potential of chloranil is
higher than that of 6. However, in the coupled catalytic
system, the reoxidation of the reduced hydroquinone also has
to be fast, and this step is faster for the electron-rich 2,6-
dimethoxyhydroquinone than for the electron-deficient tet-
rachlorohydroquinone.
A number of alcohols were oxidized to their correspond-
ing ketones by air using the biomimetic system of Scheme 11
(some selected examples are listed in Table 3). The system
was successfully applied to the oxidation of benzylic alcohols.
More resistant substrates, such as linear and cyclic aliphatic
alcohols, can be oxidized to the corresponding ketones with
good to excellent yields and high turnover frequencies
(TOFs). It is noteworthy that this catalytic system tolerates
the presence of CC double bonds, with no epoxidation of
them observed. Sterically hindered alcohols were also effi-
ciently oxidized to ketones. In most cases, the reaction was
complete within 12 h, with TONs of 100200 with catalyst 3.
This biomimetic aerobic oxidation of alcohols is reminis-
cent of biological oxidations. A comparison of the biomimetic
and biological reagents is shown in Scheme 11). It is interest-
ing to note that nature has chosen, through evolution, an
electron-rich quinone (ubiquinone) to obtain a low-energy
electron transfer from the corresponding hydroquinone to the
heme portion of cytochrome c.
In addition to the previous work, a zeolite-encapsulated
Co(salophen) catalyst was prepared and used in the three-
component catalyst system for the oxidation of primary
alcohols to aldehydes and of secondary alcohols to ketones.[70]
The new catalyst shows some advantages over the homoge-
neous system, for example ease of handling and the possibility
of recycling it irrespective of the solvent used.
Most of the ruthenium-catalyzed aerobic oxidations deal
with the oxidation of alcohols, however, ruthenium catalyst 3
can also be used for the dehydrogenation of amines to
imines.[62] The three-component catalyst system described
above was successfully applied to the aerobic oxidation of
Scheme 11. Biomimetic aerobic oxidation of alcohols.

amines.[71] The active species in catalyst 3 is the 16-electron
complex 5 which can also be generated from the dimeric
structure 8,[72] which was the selected catalyst for these
reactions. Both ketimines and aldimines were obtained in
good to excellent yields from the oxidation of the corre-
sponding amines. Amines giving ketimines were oxidized
faster than amines giving aldimines [Eq. (4)]. The combina-
tion of the biomimetic ruthenium-catalyzed oxidation of
amines in the coupled catalytic system with an organocatalytic
asymmetric Mannich reaction in one pot produces b-amino
aldehydes in high yields, excellent chemoselectivity, and up to
> 99% ee.[73]
Sheldon and co-workers have reported a related aerobic
oxidation of alcohols where the combination of [RuCl2-
(PPh3)3]
and
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
N-oxide
(TEMPO) affords an efficient catalytic system.[74] The cata-
lytic system was applied to a variety of representative primary
and secondary alcohols, which gave the corresponding
aldehydes and ketones, respectively, with greater than 99%
selectivity in all cases. Other ruthenium catalysts were tested
but gave lower reaction rates or were completely inactive.
Various metal chlorides (FeII/FeIII, NiII, PdII, and CoII/CoIII)
were tried as possible catalysts, but showed no activity when
combined with TEMPO.
Mechanistic studies are inconsistent with an oxoruthe-
nium or oxoammonium species, which led the authors to
propose a mechanism in which TEMPO acts as the ETM
between the
substrate-selective
ruthenium catalyst
and
molecular oxygen.[74b] It was proposed that the ruthenium
catalyst dehydrogenates the alcohol to give a ruthenium
hydride (RuH2(PPh3)3) species that reacts with TEMPO.
The reduced form of TEMPO (TEMPOH) reacts with
molecular oxygen to regenerate TEMPO (Scheme 12).
TEMPO does not only accelerate the oxidation of primary
alcohols to aldehydes, it also suppresses the overoxidation to
carboxylic acids by its well-documented antioxidant activity.
This stable nitroxyl radical is able to scavenge radical
intermediates during autoxidation, thereby terminating free-
radical reactions.[75]
Ishii and co-workers reported a related coupled electron-
transfer system for the oxidation of alcohols. The [RuCl2-
(PPh3)3]/hydroquinone system at atmospheric oxygen pres-
sure and in the presence of catalytic amounts of K2CO3 at
608C led to the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes in
high yield.[76]
Kaneda and co-workers developed an active trimetallic
Ru/CeO2/CoO(OH) system for the oxidation of alcohols in
the presence of molecular oxygen.[77] The heterogeneous
catalyst is effective for the oxidation of allylic, benzylic, and
secondary aliphatic alcohols to give the corresponding
ketones in high yield (8899%). Primary alcohols can be
converted into carboxylic acids; linear alcohols give excellent
yields, whereas branched or cyclic alcohols afford moderate
yields. RuIV species immobilized on the surface of the CeO2/
CoO(OH) support are responsible for the oxidation of the
alcohols. The reoxidation of the reduced Ru is believed to be
promoted by CeIV to give RuIV and CeII. It was proposed that
the electron transfer from Ru to Ce proceeds via a CeIII/RuIII
intermediate. The RuIV/CeII species is reoxidized by molec-
ular oxygen to regenerate the RuIV/CeIV system (Scheme 13).
It was assumed that the reaction of primary alcohols furnishes
aldehydes by means of the Ru/Ce system which are sub-
sequently oxidized to carboxylic acids by Co.
The use of a ruthenium/cobalt catalyst with oxygen as the
terminal oxidant for the oxidation of alcohols in the presence
of an aldehyde was reported by Murahashi et al.[78] The
aerobic oxidation is proposed to proceed through two
sequential pathways: 1) formation of peracids by a cobalt-
mediated radical chain reaction of the aldehydes with

molecular oxygen and 2) ruthenium-catalyzed oxidation of
the alcohols by the formed peracid. Ruthenium performs the
main oxidation reaction of the alcohols, and the cobalt acetate
serves as a co-catalyst for promoting the reaction of molecular
oxygen with the aldehyde. This case is a special electron-
transfer oxidation in which a stoichiometric amount of an
aldehyde is consumed and oxidized to the carboxylic acid,
which is a drawback of this method.
It should be mentioned that other transition metals can be
used in coupled electron-transfer systems for H2O2- and O2-
based oxidations of alcohols (see Sections 5 and 6).
4. Osmium-Catalyzed Biomimetic Oxidation
It has been known since the beginning of the last century
that OsO4 reacts with olefins to give an osmate ester that can
be hydrolyzed to a diol and OsO2(OH)2.[79] The OsO4/OsO3
system is an excellent substrate-selective redox catalyst for
the dihydroxylation of alkenes. Recycling of OsVI to OsVIII by
direct oxidation with H2O2
[80] or with O2
[81] has been realized.
These reoxidations lead to low selectivity for many olefins as
a result of competing CC bond cleavage and other side
reactions. More recently, efficient oxidations with O2 under
irradiation of visible light or at an elevated pH value have
been reported.[82,83] The latter process works quite well with a
range of alkenes.
In 1976 efficient oxidants for the reoxidation of OsVI to
OsVIII in catalytic dihydroxylations were reported for the first
time.[84,85] In particular the Upjohn procedure,[85] in which N-
methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) is employed as the
oxidant, was a major breakthrough and led to the frequent
use of the osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation. The synthetic
utility of the catalytic dihydroxylation was dramatically
enhanced when Sharpless and co-workers introduced the
enantioselective version.[86]
In the Upjohn procedure, alkenes are dihydroxylated
under mild conditions, with OsO4 acting as the substrate-
selective redox catalyst (Scheme 14). This system leads to
low-energy electron transfer and the use of very mild reaction
conditions for the reoxidization of OsVI back to OsVIII by
NMO. In this process, N-methylmorpholine (NMM) is formed
as a side product.
It would be highly desirable to be able to reoxidize NMM
to NMO by either molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide to
obtain a green biomimetic dihydroxylation. In 1998 we
reported that flavin 9 catalyzes the efficient oxidation of
tertiary amines to amine oxides at room temperature.[87]
Flavins constitute a part of flavoenzymes in a number of
monooxygenases; flavin 9 differs from those previously
employed, for example, 10,[88] in that N-10 is unsubstituted
and that there is an alkyl group at N-1. Furthermore, there are
no methyl groups at C-7 and C-8. The reaction of tertiary
amines with 30% aqueous H2O2 for onetwo hours at room
temperature in the presence of 9 gave quantitative yield of the
amine oxide [Eq. (5)], whereas the corresponding reaction
catalyzed by 10 gave less than 10% yield.
The new flavin was used as a catalyst for the in situ
reoxidation of NMM to NMO in the Upjohn procedure. This
reaction constitutes a new biomimetic dihydroxylation of
alkenes by H2O2, with OsO4 acting as the substrate-selective
redox catalyst, and with NMM and flavin 9 acting as ETMs.[89]
This combination results in a highly environmentally friendly
dihydroxylation of alkenes (Scheme 15). As in the other
biomimetic oxidation systems discussed above, this system
also leads to a mild kinetically controlled electron transfer
from the substrate (alkene) to the terminal oxidant (hydrogen
peroxide) at room temperature. The low-energy electron

transfer with decreasing redox potentials is the key to this
selectivity, similar to the biological oxidations.
The H2O2-based oxidation was extended to the use of
chiral ligands, such as the Sharpless ligand (DHQD)2PHAL.
The method allowed a range of olefins to be oxidized to the
corresponding diols in high enantioselectivity (Table 4, Meth-
od A).[89b] In subsequent work, the Sharpless ligand was
investigated as an ETM source as well as a source of chirality
in the catalytic system.[90] The nitrogen atom of the tertiary
amine of (DHQD)2PHAL was used as the oxo- and electron
carrier, with the N-oxide formed acting as the reoxidant of
OsVI. The results obtained with (DHQD)2PHAL functioning
as an ETM and a chiral ligand are comparable to those
obtained when NMM and (DHQD)2PHAL were used
together as the ETM and the chiral ligand, respectively
(Table 4, Method B).
Flavin 9 is an efficient ETM, but is rather unstable;
therefore, replacement of the flavin by other ETMs is of
interest. Various transition-metal complexes such as methyl-
trioxorhenium (MTO; 11) and vanadyl acetylacetonate (12)
are known to activate hydrogen peroxide. Different proce-
dures were developed in which the flavin was substituted by
these redox catalysts, and it was found that 11 and 12 can be
used as catalysts for the N oxidation of NMM in the three-
component catalyst system.[91,92]
MTO (11) was also used as an ETM in the asymmetric
osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation of various alkenes (up to
98% ee), and here the chiral ligand (DHQD)2PHAL also
played the role of an ETM.[92b] The principle of this oxidation
system is shown in Scheme 16. This new system constitutes a
robust dimetallic system for the dihydroxylation of alkenes.
It was subsequently found that the entire three-compo-
nent catalyst system of Scheme 15 can be immobilized in an
ionic liquid.[93] The use of 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate ([bmim]PF6) as the ionic liquid with
acetone as a cosolvent gave a high yield of the dihydrox-
ylation product. After extraction of the diol product, the
osmium, NMM (NMO), and flavin were retained within the
ionic liquid and could be reused after addition of new portions
of alkene and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was repeated
five times without loss of activity. The immobilization of other
three-component catalyst systems and using 11 and 12 as co-
catalysts (ETMs) has also been carried out.[94] The results
from recycling the latter catalytic system demonstrated that it
can be reused with no loss or only moderate loss of activity.
The biomimetic oxygen-transfer cascades were rational-
ized by DFT calculations.[95] It was indeed shown that
stepwise transfer of oxygen from the peroxorhenium species
via an amine N-oxide proceeds along a low-energy electron-
transfer pathway whereas direct oxygen transfer from the
peroxorhenium to an OsVI species requires a much higher
activation energy.
Choudary et al. have developed an electron-transer-based
catalytic synthesis of chiral diols by using a trifunctional solid-
state catalyst consisting of active palladium, tungsten, and
osmium species immobilized onto a layered Mg/Al double
hydroxide (LDH-PdOsW).[96] The PdCl4
2, OsO4
2, and
WO4
2 were ion-exchanged with the LDH as their potassium
or sodium salts. A prochiral olefin was obtained from a
palladium-catalyzed Heck reaction and was continuously
asymmetrically dihydroxylated by the osmium(VIII) in very
good yields and high enantioselectivity. The osmium(VI) is
reoxidized by a coupled catalytic system consisting of NMO/
WO4/H2O2 (Scheme 17). The LDH-PdOsW can be recovered
by filtration and reused up to five times with maintained
activity. It was claimed that the all three metal catalysts stay
bound to the LDH matrix during the reaction, but there is
little evidence that the osmium catalyst is effectively immo-
bilized. For example, while the OsVI (OsO4
2) can be ion-

leaching. The synthetic utility of the heterogeneous LDH-
PdOsW catalyst was demonstrated by the synthesis of
diltiazem and the taxol side chain. Chiral diols derived from
cinnamates were used as starting materials with this coupled

reported.[98] Low catalyst loadings are used in the method
and it can be run at room temperature to give the aldehyde or
ketone in high selectivity without any overoxidation products.
5. Copper-Catalyzed Biomimetic Oxidation
Many of the aerobic oxidation reactions carried out in
organic chemistry usually employ transition metals such as
palladium and ruthenium, while living organisms make use of
transition metals such as copper or iron. Copper is found in
enzymes responsible for the binding and transport of oxygen
in a variety of biological oxidation reactions.[99] However,
there are only a few examples of the use of copper as a
substrate-selective catalyst in aerobic oxidations in the
presence of ETMs.[100]
MarkK et al. reported the efficient aerobic oxidation of a
variety of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones in the presence
of a copper catalyst.[101] The use of CuCl, 1,10-phenanthroline
(phen), di-tert-butylhydrazine-1,2-dicarboxylate (DBADH2),
and K2CO3 (2 equiv) as a base in toluene at 70908C and
under O2 led to the products in good to excellent yields
[Eq. (6)]. Air can be used in place of molecular oxygen
without affecting the outcome of the reaction, but longer
reaction times are needed. The major drawback of the
procedure is the need for two equivalents of strong base
and the inefficiency in the oxidation of primary aliphatic
alcohols. Further studies showed that it was possible to
perform the reaction with only catalytic amounts of the base
in the presence of 4-L MS or in fluorobenzene.[102] Suitable
conditions for the oxidation of sensitive alcohols were
achieved by using KOtBu and the copper catalyst in a 1:1
ratio, with no racemization observed in substrates with chiral
centers at the a-position.[103] Additional studies on the
reaction conditions showed that the addition of N-methyl-
imidazole allowed the efficient oxidation of a wide range of
primary aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes
without overoxidation to the carboxylic acids.[104] This is an
elegant study, but has a disadvantage in that it is necessary to
use many co-catalysts in relatively high amounts.
In this system, copper is reoxidized by molecular oxygen
and the DBAD/DBADH2 serves as the ETM of the redox
reaction. The oxidized form of the ETM (DBAD) acts as a
hydrogen acceptor and the reduced form (DBADH2) as a
hydrogen donor when it facilitates the oxidation of the metal
by O2.
Another important catalytic system for aerobic oxidations
in the presence of copper species is the copper/TEMPO/O2
system. The first aerobic copper-catalyzed oxidation was
described by Semmelhack et al., who employed the CuCl/
TEMPO/O2 system to oxidize benzyl and allyl alcohols at
room temperature to the corresponding carbonyl com-
pounds.[105] Although TEMPO was proposed by Semmelhack
et al. to be the oxidant of the alcohol, with copper chloride
acting as a co-catalyst for the recycling of the TEMPO, recent
mechanistic studies performed by Sheldon and co-workers,
indicate that, based on their previous studies of the Ru/
TEMPO/O2 system,[74] copper is the substrate-selective redox
catalyst and TEMPO the reoxidant of the copper cata-
lyst.[2,106] The catalytic cycle starts with the reaction of
copper(I) species A with TEMPO to form a (piperidinylox-
yl)copper(II) complex B which reacts with an alcohol to give a
copper(II) alkoxide complex C and TEMPOH (Scheme 18).
The reaction of C with a second molecule of TEMPO leads to
the formation of the carbonyl compound, a second molecule
of TEMPOH, and the original copper(I) complex A. The
TEMPOH obtained during the formation of the carbonyl
compound is reoxidized by molecular oxygen, thereby closing
the catalytic cycle.
In addition to their mechanistic studies, Sheldon and co-
workers evaluated different copper salts, solvents, and N-
containing ligands and developed a mild procedure for the
oxidation of primary alcohols to give aldehydes in which
[CuBr2(bpy)], TEMPO, and air were used at room temper-
ature [Eq. (7)].[107] It is noteworthy that this system shows
high chemoselectivity for primary alcohols: when a mixture of
benzylic alcohol and a-methyl benzyl alcohol was used, only
conversion of the former was observed. This chemoselectivity
towards primary alcohols was explained as a consequence of
steric hindrance.

Punniyamurthy and co-workers have developed a related
system in which {Cu(salen)} is used as the subtrate-selective
catalyst together with TEMPO as a co-catalyst.[108] The system
offers an advantage over that described by Sheldon and co-
workers in that it does not require the use of additives, and the
catalyst can be recycled and reused up to three times without
loss of activity. However, this new system has the disadvan-
tages that it requires pure oxygen in place of air and that it has
to be performed at 1008C instead of at room temperature.
Other examples of the Cu/TEMPO system are given
below, and in these studies the aim was to recover the
catalysts by using nontraditional solvents such as perfluori-
nated solvents[109] and ionic liquids.[110,111]
Knochel and co-workers[109] described the use of perfluor-
oalkylated bipyridines as ligands for copper in the Cu/
TEMPO system. The reaction is carried out in a biphasic
perfluorinated/organic solvent mixture; the catalyst is soluble
in the perfluorinated phase while the reagents and products
are soluble in the organic phase. Thus, the method allows an
easy separation of the catalyst from the product so that the
catalyst can be recovered and reused for further reactions.
The system was applied to the aerobic oxidation of a number
of alcohols including primary and secondary benzylic, allylic,
and aliphatic alcohols in good yields [Eq. (8)].The fluorous
phase containing the catalyst was reused eight times without
significant decrease of activity.
Ansari and Gree[110] employed the CuCl/TEMPO system
in the ionic liquid [bmim]PF6 for the successful aerobic
oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to the corre-
sponding aldehydes and ketones, without any trace of over-
oxidation products [Eq. (9)]. However, only the ionic liquid
was recycled with this method and it was not possible to
recover the catalyst. In a later report, Jiang and Ragauskas[111]
developed a room-temperature aerobic oxidation of primary
alcohols to aldehydes by using the Cu/acetamido-TEMPO
system in 1-n-butyl-4-methylpyridinium hexafluorophospate
([bmpy]PF6) [Eq. (10)]. In this new system the 4-acetamido-
substituted
TEMPO
can,
in
contrast
to
unsubstituted
TEMPO, be recycled in the ionic liquid. It was possible to
oxidize a variety of primary alcohols including benzylic,
allylic, and aliphatic alcohols; no reaction was observed for
secondary alcohols. The catalysts can be recovered and reused
five times without any significant loss of activity.
The combination of MnII/CuII nitrates with TEMPO also
permits the aerobic oxidation of primary and secondary
alcohols to give aldehydes and ketones in excellent yields
under very mild conditions.[112]
6. Other Metal-Catalyzed Biomimetic Oxidations
There are only a few examples of coupled redox systems
for aerobic oxidation in which other transition metals are used
as the substrate-selective redox catalysts and electron-trans-
fer mediators. In one example, the oxidation of activated
primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding alde-
hydes and ketones, respectively, was performed with molec-
ular oxygen in the presence of a molybdenum/copper system
as the catalyst [Eq. (11)].[113] In this catalytic system, molyb-
denum acts as the oxidant of the alcohol and the copper salt
acts as the co-catalyst (ETM) which activates the molecular
oxygen. The authors evaluated different molybdenum com-
plexes, with benzylic alcohol used as the substrate, and
showed that the nature of the ligand is decisive for the success
of the reaction, with acetylacetonate (acac) being the most
effective ligand. They also studied different transition metals
known to activate O2 such as CoII, FeII, and MnII, but copper
gave the most efficient reaction. The best catalytic system
found, [MoO2(acac)2]/Cu(NO3)2, was examined for the oxi-
dation of various alcohols. Benzylic primary alcohols gave
good yields and selectivity whereas secondary benzylic
alcohols or aliphatic alcohols furnished low yields and poor
selectivity.
In 2005 Liang and co-workers reported an iron/TEMPO/
NaNO2 catalyst system for the selective and mild aerobic
oxidation of a wide range of alcohols, even those containing
CC double bonds as well as nitrogen and sulfur atoms
[Eq. (12)].[114] Benzylic and secondary alcohols were fully
converted into the corresponding carbonyl compounds in
high selectivity. It is worth noting that compounds containing

sulfur, which are problematic with many other transition-
metal-catalyzed aerobic oxidations, did not interfere with the
reaction. In a control experiment, a mixture of alcohol
(benzyl alcohol or 2-octanol) and methyl phenyl sulfide was
treated with the iron/TEMPO/nitrite catalyst: the alcohol was
oxidized selectively to the aldehyde while the sulfide
remained unchanged. The mechanism is analogous to that
of the Cu/TEMPO systems (see above). The alcohol would be
oxidized by the action of the Fe/TEMPO system and the role
of the NaNO2 would be to provide NO2, which would
reoxidize the Fe/TEMPO system to give NO. Finally, the
NO can be easily oxidized by molecular oxygen.
Zuwei et al. developed an efficient epoxidation of pro-
pylene which was performed with H2O2 and a tungsten-
containing catalyst. The process is coupled with the 2-
ethylanthraquinone/2-ethylanthrahydroquinone
(EAQ/
EAHQ) redox process for the production of H2O2 from O2;
the net effect is that the reaction consumes O2, H2 (the EAQ is
transformed into EAHQ by catalytic hydrogenation by Pd/C
and H2), and propylene to produce propylene oxide with high
selectivity (Scheme 19).[115] This system offers some advan-
tages over the previously described methods for the tungstate-
catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by H2O2;[9a,116] the first is that
in this case the terminal oxidant is molecular oxygen instead
of H2O2; the second is that the tungsten catalyst is based on a
quaternary ammonium heteropolyoxotungstate and is soluble
in the reaction mixture when it is oxidized, but insoluble when
reduced. In this way the catalyst can be recovered by simple
filtration and reused again; therefore it has the advantages of
both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous catalyst. However,
the authors state that the recovery of only 90% of the catalyst
is possible after the precipitation. This is presumably due to
the fact that precipitation/dissolution of the reduced/oxidized
catalyst is not absolute, and in this case the recycling of the
catalyst would not be effective after a few cycles.
Recently, an iron-catalyzed biomimetic epoxidation of
olefins by hydrogen peroxide was reported by Beller and co-
workers.[117]
7. Metal-Free Catalyzed Biomimetic Oxidation
There are coupled catalytic systems in which ETMs are
used for the oxidations with O2 or H2O2 where the substrate-
selective catalyst is not a transition metal. Since the aim of this
Review is to survey coupled catalytic systems with transition
metals as the substrate-selective catalyst, we will only cite a
few selected systems.
In most of these oxidations the substrate-selective catalyst
is a nitroxyl radical derived from compounds such as N-
hydroxyphthalimide
(NHPI),[106b,118]
N-hydroxysaccharin
(NHS),[106b,119] and TEMPOH.[106b,120] Some typical ETMs
that are commonly used in combination with the previous
catalysts are metal salts, usually Co, Cu, and Mn salts. It is also
worth mentioning that laccase, a multicopper oxidase, has
been used together with NHPI, TEMPOH, and other nitro-
gen-based ETMs.[121]
Hu and co-workers have recently reported a transition-
metal-free system for the aerobic oxidation of benzylic
alcohols and heteroaromatic analogues, with TEMPO used
as the oxidant.[122] In this example, Br2 and NaNO2 are used as
the co-catalysts and a wide range of primary benzylic alcohols
and secondary alcohols were effectively oxidized. The overall
mechanism of this transition-metal-free system is depicted in
Scheme 20. The same authors proposed another catalytic
system for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols with TEMPO, in
which bromine was substituted by 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethyl-
hydantoin; by using this system it is possible to perform the
reaction with water as a solvent.[123]
Another system for the oxidation of alcohols involves the
use of hypervalent iodine (iodoxybenzene) as the oxidant and
bromine and NaNO2 as ETMs.[124,125] The reactions are
conducted in water under air, and the system is suitable for
the oxidation of primary benzylic alcohols and secondary
aromatic and aliphatic alcohols to give excellent yields of the
aldehydes and ketones, respectively. However, low conver-
sions and yields are achieved with primary aliphatic alcohols.

The mechanism is similar to that proposed for the TEMPO/
Br2/NaNO2
system
developed
by
Hu
and
co-workers
(Scheme 21).
A catalytic system for the oxidation of alcohols related to
the two previous ones (TEMPO/Br2/NaNO2 and PhIO2/Br2/
NaNO2) has recently been reported. This system is composed
of TEMPO/[bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene]/NaNO2 with oxygen
as the terminal oxidant, and has been effectively employed for
the oxidation of primary benzylic alcohols, but with less
success for the oxidation of secondary benzylic or aliphatic
alcohols. The analogous immobilized hypervalent iodine
reagent was also used. It could be recycled up to three
times in the oxidation of benzylic alcohol to benzaldehyde,
with essentially the same high yield as for the free reagent,
although longer reaction times were required.[126]
Espenson et al. developed a method to oxidize alcohols by
bromine using methyltrioxorhenium (11) as a co-catalyst and
hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant in acetic acid at
room temperature.[127] With this system it is possible to oxidize
secondary alcohols and benzylic primary alcohols to the
carbonyl compounds in high yields. However, the reactions
are not totally selective and in some cases different amounts
of products derived from the esterification of the alcohols
with the solvent were detected. The method is also suitable
for the oxidation of 1,3-dioxolanes to give glycol monoesters
and for the conversion of aldehydes into methyl esters by
using methanol as a solvent. The oxidative cleavage of ethers
can be performed with this catalytic system, although the
yields for this reaction were always lower than 60%.
It is worth mentioning that in some cases flavins, which
have been typically used as ETMs (see Section 4), can be used
as the substrate-selective redox catalyst for the mild oxidation
of amines and sulfides at room temperature, with hydrogen
peroxide used as the sole reoxidant.[87,128] In nature, flavins
occurring in monooxygenases use molecular oxygen as the
oxidant. This process requires a cofactor that reduces the
hydroxyflavin that is produced after the hydroperoxyflavin
has oxidized the substrate, and in nature this cofactor is
NADPH. In an elegant study Imada, Murahashi, and co-
workers mimicked this process with the development of an
aerobic flavin-catalyzed oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides at
ambient temperature.[129] Hydrazine is used as a stoichiomet-
ric ETM (reductant), and constitutes a mimic of the NADPH
cofactor. The catalytic cycle of this biomimetic oxidation
starts with oxidation of the sulfide by a hydroperoxyflavin
(FOOH) species to give the sulfoxide and hydroxyflavin
(FOH), of which the latter undergoes dehydration to give an
oxidized flavin (F+). At this point, F+ can be transformed to
FOOH by hydrogen peroxide or it can be reduced by
hydrazine to give the reduced flavin (FH), which can be
oxidized by molecular oxygen to the hydroperoxyflavin
(FOOH, Scheme 22). The catalytic reaction also works with
tertiary amines, but only at 608C.
8. Conclusions and Outlook
Oxidation reactions are among the most commonly used
reactions in industry. However, many of the industrial
processes still use stoichiometric amounts of high-oxidation-
state metal reagents. Moreover, there is currently an active
search for environmentally friendly procedures, which are
based on the use of catalytic amounts of the metal. Thus, the
development of new methodologies that employ environ-
mentally friendly oxidants such as molecular oxygen or
hydrogen peroxide is one of the most important goals in
oxidation chemistry today. A better understanding of the
mechanisms of various electron-transfer reactions is of central
importance and will stimulate further achievements in this
area. Enantioselective oxidation reactions based on the
biomimetic approach and involving ETMs should also be
further developed.
There are systems where the catalyst is oxidized directly
by molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. However, this
strategy fails in some cases, and one can search for ligands
which facilitate the direct oxidation or make use of co-
catalysts as electron-transfer mediators (ETMs). The use of
coupled catalytic systems with electron-transfer mediators
(ETMs) is an important complement to the direct oxidation
approach which expands considerably the use of O2 and H2O2
as oxidants in catalytic oxidation reactions.

[27] This barrier may not necessarily be very high but it is much
higher than that for the competing decomposition of the Pd0
catalyst. Attempts to obtain a catalytic O2 oxidation by
stabilization of Pd0 by maleic anhydride did not lead to a
catalytic oxidation with O2 (J. E. BPckvall, R. E. Nordberg, D.
Wilhelm, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 6892; J. E. BPckvall,
R. E. Nordberg, unpublished results). In the latter case,
palladium black is not precipitated.
[28] Some of the redox potentials [eV] of the oxidants are known:
O2/H2O 1.229; BQ/HQ 0.6992. The redox potential for Pd
varies much with the ligands and, for example, for [PdCl4]2/Pd0
and Pd(OH)2/Pd0 it is 0.591 and 0.07, respectively, which
suggests that Pd(OAc)2 has an oxidation potential between
these values. The redox potential for (MLm)ox/MLm is unknown.
In general, the redox potentials vary with the solvent and the
ligand environment.

[30] There is very little known about the interaction between
hydroquinone and the metal macrocycle, it is believed that the
hydroquinone coordinates to the metal macrocycle to form a
MLm-HQ complex. This hypothesis is supported by the
observation that the addition of phenol to [Co(tpp)] gave a
new complex that was assigned on the basis of NMR
spectroscopy as [Co(tpp)(phenol)] (H. Grennberg, J. E. BPck-
vall, unpublished results).

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
