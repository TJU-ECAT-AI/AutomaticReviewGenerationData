[1] "We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12). Treatment of these two surface complexes under hydrogen at 150C overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum (111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si)(=Si-o-) Ta-H ([Ta],-H), which has been fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy, extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis, microanalysis, and quantitative chemical reactions (4)."

[2] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

[3] "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

[4] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species;"

[5] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex; reductive elimination of propane from this complex could follow, with the concomitant release of a tantalum-methyl species. (ii) A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Catalyst preparation: The active catalyst is a surface tantalum(III) monohydride ([Ta],-H) formed by treating surface tantalum complexes with hydrogen.

2. Cyclic vs. acyclic alkanes: With cyclic alkanes, only C-H bond activation occurs, forming a tantalum-cycloalkyl species. However, acyclic alkanes undergo catalytic metathesis.

3. Initiation: The first step involves C-H bond activation of the acyclic alkane via σ-bond metathesis, producing a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen.

4. C-C bond cleavage and formation: This crucial step involves the transfer of a methyl group, with two possible mechanisms:
   a) Oxidative addition followed by reductive elimination
   b) σ-bond metathesis through a four-centered transition state (preferred due to the electrophilic nature of the tantalum-alkyl species)

5. Product formation: The reaction produces higher and lower homologs of the starting alkane.

The mechanism appears to be primarily a one-site process, as it does not explicitly mention the involvement of two separate catalytic sites. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst depend on the nature of the alkane (linear vs. branched) and the possible formation of various tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The mechanism does not mention the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates, focusing instead on the direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through the proposed four-centered transition state.

由硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. 催化剂制备：活性催化剂是表面钽(III)单氢化物([Ta],-H)，通过用氢气处理表面钽络合物形成。

2. 环烷烃与非环烷烃：对于环烷烃，只发生C-H键活化，形成钽-环烷基物种。然而，非环烷烃会发生催化复分解反应。

3. 引发：第一步涉及通过σ键复分解对非环烷烃进行C-H键活化，产生钽-烷基物种和氢气。

4. C-C键断裂和形成：这一关键步骤涉及甲基的转移，有两种可能的机制：
   a) 氧化加成后还原消除
   b) 通过四中心过渡态的σ键复分解（由于钽-烷基物种的亲电性质而受到青睐）

5. 产物形成：反应产生起始烷烃的高级和低级同系物。

该机制主要appears是一个单位点过程，因为它没有明确提到两个独立催化位点的参与。催化剂的选择性和性能取决于烷烃的性质（直链vs.支链）以及可能形成的各种钽-烷基中间体。该机制没有提到烯烃或金属环丁烷作为关键中间体的形成，而是专注于通过提出的四中心过渡态直接进行C-C键断裂和形成。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. C-H Bond Activation: For acyclic alkanes, the reaction begins with C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis. This produces a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen.

2. Methyl Transfer: The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group, which requires both the breaking and formation of C-C bonds.

3. Four-Centered Transition State: The preferred mechanism involves a four-centered transition state, with an sp3 carbon at the center of the metallocycle. This is favored due to the highly electrophilic nature of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species.

4. Product Formation: This process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs of the original alkane.

The mechanism differs for cyclic and acyclic alkanes:

- Cyclic alkanes: Only stoichiometric C-H bond activation occurs, forming a tantalum(III)-cycloalkyl species.
- Acyclic alkanes: Catalytic metathesis reaction takes place, producing a range of higher and lower homologs.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst depend on:

- The nature of the alkane (cyclic vs. acyclic)
- The specific C-H and C-C bonds involved in the reaction
- The formation of various tantalum-alkyl intermediates

The document does not explicitly discuss two-site vs. one-site schemes, the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes, or provide detailed information on catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism described appears to be primarily a one-site process occurring on the surface-supported tantalum species.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：对于非环烷烃，反应始于通过σ键复分解的C-H键活化。这产生了钽-烷基物种和氢气。

2. 甲基转移：下一步涉及甲基的转移，这需要C-C键的断裂和形成。

3. 四中心过渡态：首选机理涉及四中心过渡态，金属环中心有一个sp3碳。由于二氧化硅支撑的钽-烷基物种具有高度亲电性，这种机理是首选的。

4. 产物形成：这个过程导致原始烷烃的高级和低级同系物的形成。

对于环烷烃和非环烷烃，机理是不同的：

- 环烷烃：只发生化学计量的C-H键活化，形成钽(III)-环烷基物种。
- 非环烷烃：发生催化复分解反应，产生一系列高级和低级同系物。

催化剂的选择性和性能取决于：

- 烷烃的性质（环状vs非环状）
- 参与反应的特定C-H和C-C键
- 各种钽-烷基中间体的形成

文献并未明确讨论双位点vs单位点方案、烯烃或金属环丁烷的形成，也未提供有关催化剂在各种烷烃转化中性能的详细信息。所描述的机理主要似乎是发生在表面支撑的钽物种上的单位点过程。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a one-site scheme, as the literature does not mention a two-site mechanism. The process begins with the activation of an acyclic alkane's C-H bond through σ-bond metathesis, forming a tantalum-alkyl species and releasing hydrogen. This is followed by a methyl transfer step, which involves both C-C bond cleavage and formation.

The preferred mechanism for this second step is a σ-bond metathesis involving a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle. This preference is due to the highly electrophilic nature of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species.

For linear alkanes, this process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The reaction occurs at moderate temperatures (25° to 200°C) and is catalytic in nature.

In contrast, cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic metathesis. They only experience C-H bond activation, resulting in the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum(III)-cycloalkyl species and the release of hydrogen.

The literature does not explicitly mention the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. Instead, it focuses on the formation of tantalum-alkyl species as the primary intermediates.

Regarding selectivity and catalyst performance, the mechanism suggests that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one alkane molecule to another. However, with higher alkanes, there's a wider product distribution, indicating possible secondary reactions or transfer of larger alkyl fragments.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions beyond what has been described above.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及一个单位点机制，因为文献中没有提到双位点机制。该过程始于通过σ键复分解激活非环烷烃的C-H键，形成钽-烷基物种并释放氢气。接下来是甲基转移步骤，涉及C-C键的断裂和形成。

由于二氧化硅负载的钽-烷基物种具有高度亲电性，第二步的首选机制是涉及四中心过渡态的σ键复分解，其中金属环中存在一个sp3碳。

对于直链烷烃，这个过程导致形成更高和更低的同系物。反应在中等温度（25°至200°C）下进行，并且具有催化性质。

相比之下，环烷烃不会发生催化复分解。它们只经历C-H键活化，导致钽(III)-环烷基物种的化学计量形成和氢气的释放。

文献没有明确提到烯烃或金属环丁烷作为关键中间体的形成。相反，它主要关注钽-烷基物种的形成作为主要中间体。

关于选择性和催化剂性能，该机制表明主要反应涉及从一个烷烃分子到另一个烷烃分子的甲基片段转移。然而，对于较高的烷烃，存在更广泛的产物分布，表明可能存在次级反应或较大烷基片段的转移。

除了上述描述之外，文献没有提供关于这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能的详细信息。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. C-H Bond Activation: For acyclic alkanes, the first step is the cleavage of a C-H bond through σ-bond metathesis. This produces hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl surface species. For cyclic alkanes, only this step occurs, resulting in a stoichiometric reaction rather than catalytic metathesis.

2. C-C Bond Cleavage and Formation: In acyclic alkanes, the reaction proceeds to a second step involving C-C bond cleavage and formation. This occurs through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism involving a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle.

3. Methyl Transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of a methyl group from one alkane molecule to another, facilitated by the tantalum-alkyl intermediate.

4. Product Formation: This process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs of the original alkane.

The mechanism appears to be primarily a one-site scheme, as it doesn't explicitly mention involvement of two separate catalytic sites. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on:

1. Alkane Structure: Linear and branched alkanes undergo metathesis, while cyclic alkanes only undergo C-H activation without further reaction.

2. Steric Factors: For example, in isobutane metathesis, the formation of tantalum-tert-butyl species may be disfavored due to steric hindrance.

3. Secondary Reactions: As the reaction progresses, secondary reactions can occur, leading to a wider product distribution for higher alkanes.

The mechanism does not explicitly mention the formation of alkene or metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are typically associated with olefin metathesis. Instead, it proposes direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through σ-bond metathesis. This unique mechanism allows for the metathesis of saturated alkanes, which is not possible with traditional olefin metathesis catalysts.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：对于非环烷烃，第一步是通过σ键复分解裂解C-H键。这产生氢气和钽-烷基表面物种。对于环烷烃，只发生这一步，导致化学计量反应而非催化复分解。

2. C-C键断裂和形成：在非环烷烃中，反应进行到涉及C-C键断裂和形成的第二步。这通过涉及金属环中sp3碳的四中心过渡态的σ键复分解机制发生。

3. 甲基转移：该机制涉及在钽-烷基中间体的促进下，从一个烷烃分子到另一个烷烃分子的甲基转移。

4. 产物形成：这个过程导致原始烷烃的高级和低级同系物的形成。

该机制主要是单点机制，因为它没有明确提到两个独立催化位点的参与。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能取决于：

1. 烷烃结构：直链和支链烷烃都会发生复分解，而环烷烃只发生C-H活化而无进一步反应。

2. 位阻因素：例如，在异丁烷复分解中，由于位阻，钽-叔丁基物种的形成可能不受青睐。

3. 次级反应：随着反应的进行，可能发生次级反应，导致高级烷烃产物分布更广。

该机制没有明确提到烯烃或金属环丁烷中间体的形成，这些通常与烯烃复分解相关。相反，它提出了通过σ键复分解直接断裂和形成C-C键。这种独特的机制允许饱和烷烃的复分解，而这在传统的烯烃复分解催化剂中是不可能的。

[1] "We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12).

1. Initial formation of the catalyst: The silica-supported tantalum hydride ([Ta],-H) is formed by reacting tantalum complexes with surface hydroxyl groups of dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment with hydrogen.

2. Cyclic vs. acyclic alkanes: With cyclic alkanes, only C-H bond activation occurs, forming tantalum-cycloalkyl species stoichiometrically. In contrast, acyclic alkanes undergo catalytic metathesis reactions.

3. Mechanism for acyclic alkanes:
   a. C-H bond activation: The first step involves σ-bond metathesis between the Ta-H and an alkane C-H bond, forming a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen.
   b. C-C bond cleavage and formation: The next step involves methyl group transfer, implying both C-C bond cleavage and formation.
   c. Four-centered transition state: The preferred mechanism involves a σ-bond metathesis with a four-centered transition state, featuring an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle.

4. Selectivity and product distribution: The reaction can produce both higher and lower homologs, with a preference for methyl group transfer. Secondary reactions and transfers of larger alkyl fragments may occur, especially with higher alkanes.

5. Catalyst performance: The catalyst shows activity at moderate temperatures (25-200°C) for various acyclic alkanes, including both linear and branched species. However, steric factors can limit reactivity, as seen with neopentane.

The mechanism does not explicitly mention the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes as intermediates. Instead, it focuses on the direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through the proposed four-centered transition state. This one-site mechanism appears to be the primary pathway for the observed alkane metathesis reactions.
