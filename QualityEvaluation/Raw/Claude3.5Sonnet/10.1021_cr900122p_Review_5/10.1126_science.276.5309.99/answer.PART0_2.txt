[1] "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25° to 200°C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

[2] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a σ-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species"

[3] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."

[4] "A σ-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

[5] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (III)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a one-site scheme, as the literature does not mention a two-site mechanism. The process begins with the activation of an acyclic alkane's C-H bond through σ-bond metathesis, forming a tantalum-alkyl species and releasing hydrogen. This is followed by a methyl transfer step, which involves both C-C bond cleavage and formation.

The preferred mechanism for this second step is a σ-bond metathesis involving a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle. This preference is due to the highly electrophilic nature of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species.

For linear alkanes, this process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs. The reaction occurs at moderate temperatures (25° to 200°C) and is catalytic in nature.

In contrast, cyclic alkanes do not undergo catalytic metathesis. They only experience C-H bond activation, resulting in the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum(III)-cycloalkyl species and the release of hydrogen.

The literature does not explicitly mention the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates. Instead, it focuses on the formation of tantalum-alkyl species as the primary intermediates.

Regarding selectivity and catalyst performance, the mechanism suggests that the main reaction involves the transfer of a methyl fragment from one alkane molecule to another. However, with higher alkanes, there's a wider product distribution, indicating possible secondary reactions or transfer of larger alkyl fragments.

The literature does not provide detailed information on how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions beyond what has been described above.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及一个单位点机制，因为文献中没有提到双位点机制。该过程始于通过σ键复分解激活非环烷烃的C-H键，形成钽-烷基物种并释放氢气。接下来是甲基转移步骤，涉及C-C键的断裂和形成。

由于二氧化硅负载的钽-烷基物种具有高度亲电性，第二步的首选机制是涉及四中心过渡态的σ键复分解，其中金属环中存在一个sp3碳。

对于直链烷烃，这个过程导致形成更高和更低的同系物。反应在中等温度（25°至200°C）下进行，并且具有催化性质。

相比之下，环烷烃不会发生催化复分解。它们只经历C-H键活化，导致钽(III)-环烷基物种的化学计量形成和氢气的释放。

文献没有明确提到烯烃或金属环丁烷作为关键中间体的形成。相反，它主要关注钽-烷基物种的形成作为主要中间体。

关于选择性和催化剂性能，该机制表明主要反应涉及从一个烷烃分子到另一个烷烃分子的甲基片段转移。然而，对于较高的烷烃，存在更广泛的产物分布，表明可能存在次级反应或较大烷基片段的转移。

除了上述描述之外，文献没有提供关于这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能的详细信息。
