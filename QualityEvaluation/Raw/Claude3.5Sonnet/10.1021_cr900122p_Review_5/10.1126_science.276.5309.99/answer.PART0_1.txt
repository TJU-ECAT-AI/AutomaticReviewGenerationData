[1] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

[2] "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

[3] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species"

[4] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."

[5] "A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. C-H Bond Activation: For acyclic alkanes, the reaction begins with C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis. This produces a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen.

2. Methyl Transfer: The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group, which requires both the breaking and formation of C-C bonds.

3. Four-Centered Transition State: The preferred mechanism involves a four-centered transition state, with an sp3 carbon at the center of the metallocycle. This is favored due to the highly electrophilic nature of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species.

4. Product Formation: This process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs of the original alkane.

The mechanism differs for cyclic and acyclic alkanes:

- Cyclic alkanes: Only stoichiometric C-H bond activation occurs, forming a tantalum(III)-cycloalkyl species.
- Acyclic alkanes: Catalytic metathesis reaction takes place, producing a range of higher and lower homologs.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst depend on:

- The nature of the alkane (cyclic vs. acyclic)
- The specific C-H and C-C bonds involved in the reaction
- The formation of various tantalum-alkyl intermediates

The document does not explicitly discuss two-site vs. one-site schemes, the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes, or provide detailed information on catalyst performance in various alkane conversions. The mechanism described appears to be primarily a one-site process occurring on the surface-supported tantalum species.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：对于非环烷烃，反应始于通过σ键复分解的C-H键活化。这产生了钽-烷基物种和氢气。

2. 甲基转移：下一步涉及甲基的转移，这需要C-C键的断裂和形成。

3. 四中心过渡态：首选机理涉及四中心过渡态，金属环中心有一个sp3碳。由于二氧化硅支撑的钽-烷基物种具有高度亲电性，这种机理是首选的。

4. 产物形成：这个过程导致原始烷烃的高级和低级同系物的形成。

对于环烷烃和非环烷烃，机理是不同的：

- 环烷烃：只发生化学计量的C-H键活化，形成钽(III)-环烷基物种。
- 非环烷烃：发生催化复分解反应，产生一系列高级和低级同系物。

催化剂的选择性和性能取决于：

- 烷烃的性质（环状vs非环状）
- 参与反应的特定C-H和C-C键
- 各种钽-烷基中间体的形成

文献并未明确讨论双位点vs单位点方案、烯烃或金属环丁烷的形成，也未提供有关催化剂在各种烷烃转化中性能的详细信息。所描述的机理主要似乎是发生在表面支撑的钽物种上的单位点过程。
