[1] "We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12). Treatment of these two surface complexes under hydrogen at 150C overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum (111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si)(=Si-o-) Ta-H ([Ta],-H)"

[2] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

[3] "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

[4] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species"

[5] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."

[6] "A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Initial formation of the catalyst: The silica-supported tantalum hydride ([Ta],-H) is formed by reacting tantalum complexes with surface hydroxyl groups of dehydroxylated silica, followed by treatment with hydrogen.

2. Cyclic vs. acyclic alkanes: With cyclic alkanes, only C-H bond activation occurs, forming tantalum-cycloalkyl species stoichiometrically. In contrast, acyclic alkanes undergo catalytic metathesis reactions.

3. Mechanism for acyclic alkanes:
   a. C-H bond activation: The first step involves σ-bond metathesis between the Ta-H and an alkane C-H bond, forming a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen.
   b. C-C bond cleavage and formation: The next step involves methyl group transfer, implying both C-C bond cleavage and formation.
   c. Four-centered transition state: The preferred mechanism involves a σ-bond metathesis with a four-centered transition state, featuring an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle.

4. Selectivity and product distribution: The reaction can produce both higher and lower homologs, with a preference for methyl group transfer. Secondary reactions and transfers of larger alkyl fragments may occur, especially with higher alkanes.

5. Catalyst performance: The catalyst shows activity at moderate temperatures (25-200°C) for various acyclic alkanes, including both linear and branched species. However, steric factors can limit reactivity, as seen with neopentane.

The mechanism does not explicitly mention the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes as intermediates. Instead, it focuses on the direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through the proposed four-centered transition state. This one-site mechanism appears to be the primary pathway for the observed alkane metathesis reactions.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. 催化剂的初始形成：二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物（[Ta],-H）是通过钽配合物与脱羟基二氧化硅的表面羟基反应，然后在氢气处理下形成的。

2. 环烷烃与非环烷烃的比较：对于环烷烃，只发生C-H键活化，化学计量地形成钽-环烷基物种。相比之下，非环烷烃会发生催化复分解反应。

3. 非环烷烃的机理：
   a. C-H键活化：第一步涉及Ta-H与烷烃C-H键之间的σ键复分解，形成钽-烷基物种和氢气。
   b. C-C键断裂和形成：下一步涉及甲基转移，意味着C-C键的断裂和形成。
   c. 四中心过渡态：首选机理涉及具有四中心过渡态的σ键复分解，其特征是金属环中存在sp3杂化碳。

4. 选择性和产物分布：该反应可以产生更高和更低的同系物，倾向于甲基转移。二次反应和较大烷基片段的转移可能发生，特别是对于较高的烷烃。

5. 催化剂性能：催化剂在中等温度（25-200°C）下对各种非环烷烃（包括直链和支链物种）显示活性。然而，立体因素可能限制反应性，如在新戊烷的情况中所见。

该机理并未明确提及烯烃或金属环丁烷作为中间体的形成。相反，它侧重于通过提出的四中心过渡态直接进行C-C键断裂和形成。这种单位点机理似乎是观察到的烷烃复分解反应的主要途径。
