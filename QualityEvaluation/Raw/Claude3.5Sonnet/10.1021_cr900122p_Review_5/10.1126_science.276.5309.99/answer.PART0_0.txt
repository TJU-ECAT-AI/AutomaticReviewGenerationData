[1] "We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12). Treatment of these two surface complexes under hydrogen at 150C overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum (111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si)(=Si-o-) Ta-H ([Ta],-H), which has been fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy, extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis, microanalysis, and quantitative chemical reactions (4)."

[2] "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

[3] "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

[4] "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species;"

[5] "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds. Among the known elementary steps, two possibilities can be considered: (i) The oxidative addition of the ethane C-C bond (16) would yield the dimethyl(ethyl)tantalum(V) surface complex; reductive elimination of propane from this complex could follow, with the concomitant release of a tantalum-methyl species. (ii) A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Catalyst preparation: The active catalyst is a surface tantalum(III) monohydride ([Ta],-H) formed by treating surface tantalum complexes with hydrogen.

2. Cyclic vs. acyclic alkanes: With cyclic alkanes, only C-H bond activation occurs, forming a tantalum-cycloalkyl species. However, acyclic alkanes undergo catalytic metathesis.

3. Initiation: The first step involves C-H bond activation of the acyclic alkane via σ-bond metathesis, producing a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen.

4. C-C bond cleavage and formation: This crucial step involves the transfer of a methyl group, with two possible mechanisms:
   a) Oxidative addition followed by reductive elimination
   b) σ-bond metathesis through a four-centered transition state (preferred due to the electrophilic nature of the tantalum-alkyl species)

5. Product formation: The reaction produces higher and lower homologs of the starting alkane.

The mechanism appears to be primarily a one-site process, as it does not explicitly mention the involvement of two separate catalytic sites. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst depend on the nature of the alkane (linear vs. branched) and the possible formation of various tantalum-alkyl intermediates. The mechanism does not mention the formation of alkenes or metallacyclobutanes as key intermediates, focusing instead on the direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through the proposed four-centered transition state.

由硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. 催化剂制备：活性催化剂是表面钽(III)单氢化物([Ta],-H)，通过用氢气处理表面钽络合物形成。

2. 环烷烃与非环烷烃：对于环烷烃，只发生C-H键活化，形成钽-环烷基物种。然而，非环烷烃会发生催化复分解反应。

3. 引发：第一步涉及通过σ键复分解对非环烷烃进行C-H键活化，产生钽-烷基物种和氢气。

4. C-C键断裂和形成：这一关键步骤涉及甲基的转移，有两种可能的机制：
   a) 氧化加成后还原消除
   b) 通过四中心过渡态的σ键复分解（由于钽-烷基物种的亲电性质而受到青睐）

5. 产物形成：反应产生起始烷烃的高级和低级同系物。

该机制主要appears是一个单位点过程，因为它没有明确提到两个独立催化位点的参与。催化剂的选择性和性能取决于烷烃的性质（直链vs.支链）以及可能形成的各种钽-烷基中间体。该机制没有提到烯烃或金属环丁烷作为关键中间体的形成，而是专注于通过提出的四中心过渡态直接进行C-C键断裂和形成。
