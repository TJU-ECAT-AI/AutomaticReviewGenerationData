I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

A full understanding of a catalytic reaction requires a thorough identification of precursor and
intermediate species. In this regard spectroscopies, in general, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, in
particular, can play an important role. However, the spectroscopic identification of precursor and
intermediate species is often difficult owing to their transient nature. In this review we show how
control of experimental parameters such as temperature, equilibrium pressure, and reactantcat-
alyst contact time allows experimentalists to alter the rates of dynamic processes and consequently
to modify appreciably the relative concentrations of precursor, intermediate, and product species
present under reaction conditions. In this context, time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy (with con-
stant temperature and pressure during the experiment) and also temperature-time resolved (with
both temperature and time changing simultaneously in a controlled way during the experiment)
can be useful for kinetic investigations of several types of reactions. In this review several examples
demonstrating the potential value of FTIR spectroscopy for the identification of surface transient
species are discussed. These are classified in four main categories: (i) adsorption processes and
transformations in the adsorbed state; (ii) proton-catalyzed oligomerization and polymerization
of alkenes and unsaturated molecules in protonic zeolites; (iii) oligomerization reactions catalyzed
by basic surface sites, and (iv) oligomerization and polymerization of alkenes on catalysts in-
corporating supported transition metal ions. All these reactions are discussed in the framework of
a few common potential energy profiles in which the evolution from the precursor through the
intermediate species to the final products is governed by the relative height of the corresponding
activation energy barriers.

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
