The reactivity of the two alkylidynetungsten complexes, [W(=CCMe,) (CH,CMe,),] and [W(-CCMe,) - 
Cl,(dme)] (dme = 1 
,2-dimethoxyethane), was determined with the surface o
f
 different inorganic oxides, 
such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina and niobia; their catalytic activity was tested for the metathesis of 
cis-pent-2-ene. The most efficient solids resulted from the interaction o
f
 these complexes with the 
surface o
f
 partially dehydroxylated niobia and silica-alumina. An attempt to identify the surface 
complexes on niobia (most active system) and silica (less active system) revealed the presence of a 
number o
f
 different anchored complexes, some o
f
 them bearing a neopentylidene ligand. The possible 
correlation between catalytic activity and some o

s
 discussed. 
The reactivity of organometallic complexes with the surface 
functional groups of amorphous inorganic oxides has been 
extensively studied during the last twenty years; the rules which 
govern this chemistry compare with those of molecular 
organometallic chemistry. 
Among the objectives of such 
studies is the synthesis of surface-anchored complexes with a 
predefined co-ordination sphere. With these heterogeneous 
molecular complexes, the metal atom is surrounded by two 
distinct types of ligands, (i) the solid ligands, generally non- 
labile oxy-type surface ligands which anchor the complex to the 
solid surface and (ii) the classical 
ligands, which influence the 
chemical reactivity of the complex via their steric and electronic 
properties and/or their lability, as it occurs with homogeneous 
catalysts. Stability and/or chemical reactivity of the anchored 
complexes may thus be enhanced, when compared to their 
molecular counterparts, by immobilization and/or ligand- 
substitution effects. Thus, for example, zirconium hydride 
complexes, when supported on a partially dehydroxylated silica, 
are thermally very stable (up to 473 K under H2) 
and present a 
high reactivity towards the C-H bonds of alkanes, such as 
methane, propane or cyclooctane,2 
a reactivity not yet reported 
with complexes such as [ZrH2(q 
5-C5H5)2] 
for example. 
We wish to report here our approach to the synthesis of 
supported tungsten-based molecular complexes, catalysts for 
the reaction of olefin metathesis. Given that the most active 
well characterized homogeneous tungsten-based catalysts are 
alkylidenetungsten(v1) c o m  l e x e s ,  *   
proceeding via the metal- 
locarbene mechanism of Chauvin and co-orkers, 
we decided 
to try to synthesize a surface alkylidenetungsten(v1) complex. If 
one considers on the one hand the surface chemical properties 
(redox, acid-base) of amorphous inorganic oxides and on the 
other hand the different methods of synthesis of molecular 
alkylidene complexes, then at least three different types of 
precursor complexes can reasonably be envisaged in order to 
achieve our goal. (i) Alkylidyne complexes. Direct protonation 
of the carbynic W=C bond by surface Bronsted acids [equation 
(I)] 
would lead to the formation of the desired surface- 
anchored alkylidene complexes. (ii) Alkoxyalkylidene comp- 
lexes. The simple substitution of an alkoxy ligand by a surface 
MO entity (M = Si, A
1
 . . .) is expected [equation (2)]. This 
reaction must occur under conditions where the alkylidene 
moiety is unreactive towards the surface functional groups. 
(iii) Polyalkyl complexes. The first reaction must result in the 
anchoring of the complex to the surface; this may occur via 
an alkyl or another ligand (electrophilic attack by a surface 
proton). Subsequently, an a-H abstraction on an alkyl ligand, 
with elimination of the alkane [equation (3)] would lead to 
the expected surface alkylidene complex. All these reactions 
[equations (1)-(3)] 
have been described with molecular 
complexes.

Reaction (l), in principle a one-step synthesis of a surface-

[W(CCMe,)Cl,(dme)] 
(dme = 1 
,Zdimethoxyethane) 2 as precursor complexes. The 
choice of the inorganic oxide is crucial for the catalytic 
properties of the resultant supported complex. 
l o  We report our 
results concerning the influence of the surface properties of some 
inorganic oxides on their reactivity with complexes 1 and 2 and 
the catalytic properties of these solids for olefin metathesis. 
Some aspects of the relevant surface organometallic chemistry 
will be given and discussed in relation with the most probable 
nature of the active sites.

(CBMM, 100 m2 g-I, previously calcined 
at 723 K under 0,) 
were treated under vacuum (lo4 Torr M 
1.33 x lo-' 
Pa) overnight, at the desired temperature. 
Solvents (Prolabo) were distilled under nitrogen over sodium- 
benzophenone (pentane, hexane, heptane), P,O, (methylene 
chloride) or CaCl, (acetone) and stored under argon on 
molecular sieves (4 A). cis-Pent-2-ene, pent-1

trans-2,5-dimethylhex-3-ene 
(Fluka) were stored on molecular 
sieves (4 A); allyl bromide (Aldrich) was distilled prior use. 
Synthesis o
f
 the Catalysts.-The 
catalysts were prepared at 
room temperature under argon using Schlenk-tube techniques. 
The pretreated inorganic oxides (typically 2 g) were impreg- 
nated with a solution of the complex. With 1, n-hexane was used 
as solvent and the gas phase was analysed, after ca. I5 min of 
interaction, by gas chromatography (GC) using n-butane as an 
internal standard. With 2, methylene chloride was used as 
solvent; HCl formed during the reaction was trapped by a 
NaOH solution. After ca. 30 min of reaction, acid back- 
titration of the excess alkali gave the amount of HCl released 
during the reaction. In all cases, the solids were washed with the 
appropriate solvent in order to remove unreacted complex, 
dried under vacuum and then stored at 248 K under argon (or 
vacuum) until the determination of their properties. 
Determination o
f
 the Catalytic Properties.-All experiments 
of metathesis of cis-pent-2-ene 
were carried out under argon, at 
room temperature. Aliquots of the same solid sample, prepared 
as described above, were transferred under argon to a Pyrex 
batch reactor and suspended under magnetic stirring in n- 
hexane. cis-Pent-2-ene was introduced uia a syringe. Analysis 
of the gas phase was performed on an Intersmat IGC FL 
chromatograph, equipped with a flame ionization detector and 
an Al,O,-KCl 
on fused-silica capillary column (50 m x 
0.32 mm). The conversion of cis-pent-2-ene was calculated 
according to equation (4). The reactions of exchange between

the surface alkylidene and pent- 1

analogous conditions, but using n-heptane as solvent and n- 
pentane as internal standard. The reaction between the surface 
complexes and acetone was followed by GC analysis of the 
liquid phase (n-hexane

solvent) and using n-heptane as internal 
standard. 
Typically 
0.1 cm3 
acetone was introduced on a sample 
with a content of ca. lo4 mol tungsten.

Spinning) NMR Studies.-Solid-state 
NMR spectra were 
recorded on a Bruker MSL spectrometer, operating at 75.4 
MHz and equipped with a double-bearing probe allowing 
spinning frequencies of 3-4 kHz. The conditions of cross 
polarization were a 5 ms contact time, 90" for 'H = 6.2 ps. 
Typically 11 000 scans were accumulated with a delay of 5 s. 
Chemical shifts are given relative to external SiMe,. 
Results 
We determined first which types of inorganic oxide(s) were able 
to react chemically 
with complexes 1 
and 2, with formation of a 
true surface-anchored complex. Next, we analysed the catalytic 
properties of these anchored complexes for the reaction of 
metathesis of cis-pent-2-ene. Finally, we selected the best 
catalytic systems in order to identify the active surface 
complexes.

 the 
Resulting Solids.-Four 
inorganic oxides were chosen, which 
present different surface acid-base properties, e.g. silica, 
alumina, niobia and silica-alumina.6.'2 For two of them, 
namely silica and niobia, the concentration and/or the nature of 
the surface functional groups were varied via the temperature 
(T/K) of evacuation of the solids, prior to reaction with the 
complexes. 
When these four oxides are impregnated with a solution of 
either complex 1 or 2, the liquid phase is instantaneously 
decolourized, while the solids, initially white, take up a colour 
(Table 1). In the case of SiO,, this phenomenon is slow. With 
complex 1, a yellow-orange powder, all the oxides become 
yellow, except Nb,05[573], which turns dark grey. With 
complex 2, a purple powder, most solids take up a colour 
different from that of the precursor complex, i.e. either yellow 
(SiO,, Nb,05) or green (Si0,-Al,O,). 
Only y-Al,O, takes 
up a colour similar to that of the precursor complex, i.e. 
purple. These observations suggest that, in most cases, dramatic 
changes of the ligand field around tungsten and/or the oxidation 
state of tungsten have occurred. The simultaneous evolution of 
neopentane or HCl, respectively, suggests that a true chemical 
reaction has indeed occurred between the complexes 1 and 2 
and the different inorganic oxides. 
The maximum amount of complex which can precisely 
react with a given surface, M,O,[T], 
was determined from 
preliminary experiments using a large excess of precursor 
complex (Table 1). Thus, for all subsequent experiments, 
designed for the quantitative determination of the amount 
of gas released, the amount of precursor complex introduced 
on the inorganic oxide (WIin) 
was chosen below or close to 
these values. 
With complex 1, the amount of neopentane liberated 
comprised between 1.2 and 1.8 
mol per mol w],. 
This amount 
decreases only slightly as the temperature of pretreatment of 
the support increases (Table 1). The reaction of complex 2 
with these same oxides releases only a small amount of HCl 
(0.2-0.5 mol per mol W],), except with SiO,[473] for which 
a value close to 1.5 
mol per mol [WlS 
is obtained. 
The catalytic properties of some of these solids were 
determined at room temperature for the metathesis of cis- 
pent-2-ene. Complex 1, inactive in solution, becomes active 
when supported on any of the four oxides studied [Fig. l(a)]. 
The performances seem to be correlated mainly to the nature 
of the support itself, and to some extent to its degree of 
dehydroxylation (at least for Nb,05 and SiO, in the range of 
tested T). 
This favourable effect of the support decreases as 
follows: Si0,-A1,03[773] 
M Nb,0,[573] 
> A1,0,[673] 
z 
Nb205[393] 9 SiO,[473] 
M SiO,[773]. 
With complex 2, 
the influence of these same parameters is more dramatic [Fig. 
l(b)]. Thus, the activity of supported 2 decreases as follows: 
Si0,-Al,03[773] 
> A1,03[673] > Nb,0,[573] 
> Nb,O,- 
[413] 9 SiO,[473, 7731 = 0. As far as activity is concerned 
Si0,-A1,03[773] 
is the best support for both complexes, but 
the relevant catalysts are not selective: double-bond migration 
occurs even at low conversions, and consequently cross- 
metathesis reactions take place between pent- 
1 
-ene and pent-2- 
enes. Niobium oxide appears to be a good support 
in both cases; 
the catalytic activity is lower for the trichloroneopentylidyne 
complex, despite the presence of more electron-withdrawing 
ligands. Given these differences, 
we decided to study the niobia- 
supported systems in some more detail.

53 and 11 
15 cm-, typical of neopentyl groups 
appear. Simultaneously, the IR spectrum of the gas phase 
reveals the presence of neopentane.  
Carbon-1 3 CP MAS NMR spectra were recorded on similar 
samples of complex 1 
or 2 with Nb20,[573]. With Nb20,, the 
spectrum shows a broad peak at ca. S 32. The possible presence 
of one or more of the three types of ligands, i.e. neopentyl, 
neopentylidene and neopentylidyne, around tungsten in 
different surface complexes 
hampers any reasonable assignment 
of the NMR peaks [Fig. 2(a)]. With 2-Nb20,[573] 
two 
signals, at 6 35 and 3 
1, are observed [Fig. 2 (b)]. By comparison 
with the MAS NMR spectrum of an authentic sample of 
complex 2 [Fig. 2(c)], one of these signals (possibly that at S 35) 
might be attributed to a CH, group (C,) of a neopentylidyne 
ligand; the other one may be assigned to a CH, group of either a 
neopentylidene or neopentyl ligand. No other signal could be 
detected. It must be emphasized that even in the case of 
unsupported complex 2 we could not detect, under our 
experimental conditions, any signal assignable to a C, (i.e. a 
carbon in the a position to tungsten). 
These data clearly indicate that full identification of the 
surface-grafted complexes cannot be achieved by spectroscopic 
techniques. They nevertheless confirm the participation of the 
Bronsted acidic surface hydroxyl groups to the surface reaction 
and the presence in all cases of molecular entities with a 
neopentyl backbone.

 neopentane or HC1 released during the

complexes 1 and 2 to the surface may involve either the 
alkylidyne ligand and/or the alkyl or even chlorine ligands 
respectively. In the first case, no gas evolution should occur, 
while in the second case liberation of neopentane or HCl 
respectively should take place. Quantitative analysis of the gas 
phase during impregnation of niobia by the solution of complex 
was thus performed and studied as function of T. 
Analysis of the experimental data (Table 2) reveals that the 
amount of neopentane or HCl released during impregnation 
decreases as the temperature of pretreatment of Nb205 
increases. This behaviour compares well with the variation of 
the concentration of Bronsted acid sites on the surface of 
Nb20, with temperature [Fig. 3(c)].

This latter parameter may affect 
not only the reaction of niobia with complex 1 or 2, but also 
the catalytic properties of these solids. 
All the samples were prepared with a tungsten concentration 
close to 0.5% (by weight), i.e. a concentration far from total 
surface coverage (no unreacted complex should be present, see 
Table 1). The catalytic activities of these samples were studied 
under mild conditions, as described in the Experimental section. 
Initial turnover rates are given in Table 2 as a function of T. 
For 
both niobia-supported complexes, a maximum activity is 
observed when niobia is pretreated at ca. 573 K [Fig. 3(a) 
and 
3(b)]. 
A very similar variation is observed for the Lewis-acid 
concentration on the surface of Nb205

 l-niobia and 2-niobia with acetone. If the 
initial active site is a surface tungsten complex bearing a 
neopentylidene ligand, the catalytic activity may be correlated 
to the initial concentration of alkylidene ligands. The initial 
concentration of neopentylidene fragments, resulting from the 
reaction between Nb,O,[T] and complex 1 or 2 respectively, 
was determined from the amount of 2,4,4-trimethylpent-2-ene 
liberated by the reaction of the relevant solids with acetone 
[equation (5)]. This Wittig-type reaction may not be quanti- 
place; in the case of allyl bromide, no such products were 
detected. 
With trans-2,5-dimethylhex-3-ene, 
no 2,2,5-trimethylhex-3- 
ene, the product expected for metathetical exchange of this 
olefin with a neopentylidene ligand, could be detected [equation 
(9)] which may be related to the bulkiness of this olefin.

tative, although yields comprised between 82 and 100% are 
generally reported. 
The results obtained with complexes 1 and 2 differ 
significantly; whatever T, the neopentylidene concentration 
appears to be 2-3 times larger with 2-niobia than with l-niobia 
(Table 2). But, its variation with Tis in any case rather smooth, 
a small maximum being observed in the 473-573 K temperature 
domain (Fig. 3). Thus, initial activity and concentration of 
neopentylidenetungsten complexes are not directly propor- 
tional; this suggests that different types of surface-active 
complexes, which do not necessarily directly involve 
an initially 
present neopentylidene ligand, may be present on the surface. 
Reactivity o
f
 l-niobia and 2-niobia towards ole$ns. The first 
step of any reaction of metathesis catalysed by a neopentylidene 
complex is the reaction of exchange of the neopentylidene 
ligand by the alkylidene fragment resulting from the olefin 
[equation (6)]. We first studied the behaviour of l-niobia and 
2-niobia towards pent-l-ene and allyl bromide, by analysing 
the first formed products. In both cases, 3,3-dimethylbut- 
l-ene 
is formed [equations (7) and (8)]. Only in the case of allyl

namely 3-methylbut-l-ene (by far the major product), iso- 
butene, 2,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, 5-methylhex-2-ene and traces 
of propene were observed. These unexpected results suggest that 
this bulky olefin reacts with a surface complex in a manner 
which does not involve a metathetical exchange of the olefin 
with the neopentylidene ligand. Among the mechanisms of 
formation of the first metallocarbene so far proposed in the 
literature, the n-ally1 mechanism, previously described for the 
system ReO,(Me)-Nb20, 
,I7 accounts for all the products. This 
mechanism implies that a reduced tungsten species [tungsten 
( 
GIV)] is formed initially by reaction between the precursor 
neopentylidynetungsten complexes 
and the surface of the niobia. 
Characterization o
f
 Silica-supported 1 and 2.-Under 
our 
experimental conditions, both l-Si02 and 2-SiO, are poor 
catalysts or even inactive for the metathesis of cis-pent-2-ene 
(Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the reactivity of 1-Si02[473] towards 
acetone indicates the presence of a reasonable concentration 
of neopentylidenetungsten surface complexes, an amount 
apparently slightly larger than with 1-Nb205[573] (Table 3). 
The reactivity of these same solids towards allyl bromide is also 
similar to that of 1-Nb205[573], but the reactivity of l-SiO, 
and l-Nb205 towards trans-2,5-dimethylhex-3-ene 
is dramati- 
cally 
different, only a very small amount of 3-methylbut-1 
-ene is 
formed with 1-Si02[474]. This is about ten times less than with 
1-Nb20,[573], but comparable to 2-Nb205[573]. 
Considering these data (Table 3), the activity of these 
supported tungsten complexes seems to be correlated to the 
concentration of the surface species giving rise to 3-methylbut- 
1 
-ene when treated with trans-2,5-dimethylhex-3-ene. 
Accord- 
ingly, the initially formed neopentylidene ligand would not 
necessarily be involved in the catalytic reaction. 
Discussion 
The neopentylidyne complexes W(CCMe,)X,] 
become 
(X = neopentyl) or are more (X = C1) active metathesis 
catalysts when supported on inorganic oxides such as silica- 
alumina, niobia or alumina. Under the same experimental 
conditions, silica is only a very poor support. However, Weiss 
and Lossel,18 who were the first to immobilize these same 
complexes on silica, obtained good catalysts for the metathesis 
of oct-I -ene at 344 or 395 K, when using a highly de- 
hydroxylated silica (silica[ l l  
731).

Scheme 1 Some of the possible complexes formed by reaction of 
complex 1 or 2 with the surface of inorganic oxides. Step (i) involves 
the electrophilic attack of a surface proton on an X ligand liberating 
HX, whereas step (ii) involves protonation of the carbynic WEC bond 
by surface Bronsted acid 
The formation of neopentane or HCl as the result of the 
complex-support interaction indicates that at least one type of 
chemical reaction takes place, which must be an electrophilic 
attack of surface protons on an X ligand [equation (lo)]. This 
X3W(ZCCMe,) + x H - 0 - 1  - 
( J-O),W(SCCMe3)X3-, 
(10) 
+xHX 
type of reaction leads to the anchoring of the complexes to the 
surface through a covalent bond between the tungsten atom 
and a surface oxygen. Because x, the number of moles of HX 
liberated per mole [Ws, 
is not an integer whatever the support, 
one must consider that, even if reaction (10) is the only type of 
surface reaction, then at least two types of surface complexes 
are 
formed, differing by the number of bonds to the surface. Thus, 
with HX = neopentane, x is larger than 1; this suggests that 
reaction (10) may lead to at least two surface complexes, such as 
A and A (Scheme 1). With X = C1, x is smaller than 1 and a 
second type of reaction certainly occurs on the surface, which 
does not involve the chlorine ligands. 
This latter hypothesis is corroborated by the following 
complementary observations. The Wittig-type reactivity of the 
supported complexes towards acetone, their capacity to ex- 
change metathetically with olefins such as allyl bromide 
strongly suggest that among these surface 
complexes, some bear 
a neopentylidene 
ligand. The formation of this ligand can result 
from the protonation of the initial carbynic bond, WzCR, by 
surface Bronsted acids [equation (l)]. This reaction leads 
also to tungsten complexes, covalently bonded to surface 
oxygen atoms (species B, Scheme 1). 
When the surface complex bears at least two neopentyl 
ligands, an a-H abstraction may be envisaged, with elimination 
of neopentane [equation (3)l. Such surface complexes are not 
represented in Scheme 1 for sake of simplicity. If complex 1 
was 
directly transformed uia reaction (3) (perhaps mediated by the 
surface), then the resultant alkylidene complex would not be 
bonded to the surface. As none of the surface complexes could 
be removed by a solvent, reaction (3) can only involve a 
complex already grafted to the surface by another type of 
reaction, such as, for example, reactions (1) or (10). 
It appears that in all the cases studied, and more specifically 
on niobia, at least two different types of reactions must occur on 
the surface. Their relative importance is a function of the degree 
of hydroxylation of the surface, of the surface acidity (type and 
strength) and of the nature of the ligand X. Scheme 1 represents 
most of the possible types of surface complexes which can result 
from such reactions. The formation of A, B and C 
relies on the 
existence of neighbouring hydroxyl groups, a situation which 
may be favoured on the less dehydroxylated surfaces. 
The comparison of the reactivity of 1-Nb20,[573] and 2- 
Nb20, 
[573] with that of 1-Si02[473] towards acetone, allyl 
bromide and trans-2,5-dimethylhex-3-ene 
respectively leads to 
the following observations. (i) The most active catalyst, i.e. 1- 
Nb20,[573] shows 
a low concentration of poorly exchangeable 
neopentylidene ligands, but the largest amount of reduced 
[W] surface species; 
(ii) although the amount of exchangeable 
neopentylidene 
is large for 2-Nb20, [573], the catalytic activity 
of the solid is poor. This seems to be correlated to the absence of 
reduced w] 
species; and (iii) the correlation between the 
concentration of reduced 
surface entities and catalytic 
activity seems to hold for 1-Si02[473]. 
The process of formation of such reduced species is not yet 
fully understood. It may result from a reaction of reductive 
coupling of neopentyl ligands with elimination of 2,2,5,5- 
tetramethylhexane [equation (1 l)], a reaction which can only 
occur with complex 1 as precursor; this well known reaction 
occurs during the synthesis 
of 1. On the surface, complexes A, 
B, B 
and C 
may undergo this type of reduction. Small amounts 
of dineopentane have been detected during impregnation of 
Nb205[573] with 1, 
but could not be quantified. 
The supported catalytic systems described here may never- 
theless be even more complicated. Indeed, none of the species 
so far proposed on the basis of our experimental results and on 
the reported chemical reactivity of complexes 1 and 2 towards 
different reactants, can be reconciled with the observed relation 
between catalytic activity and concentration of surface Lewis- 
acid sites on niobia. Niobia, when compared to oxides such as 
silica-alumina for example, presents very strong Lewis-acid 
sites in the low-temperature domain (373-573 K) (this occurs 
only above 773 K for silica-alumina). Such strong Lewis-acid 
sites 
may be able to induce the heterolytic dissociation of a W-C 
bond resulting in the transfer of a neopentyl ligand from W to 
the Nb5+ Lewis-acid site. This reaction would lead to the 
formation on the surface of a cation-like tungsten(v1) 
complex, 
a species co-ordinatively and electronically unsaturated and 
thus a potential active site [equation (1 
2)]. This type of reaction 
takes place when [ThMe2(qS-CsMe5)2] is treated with a 
highly dehydroxylated alumina (Al,O,[ 12231). In the present 
case, the formation of cationic tungsten surface complexes 
would help to explain the variation in activity of 1-Nb20, with 
the temperature of dehydroxylation, and its correlation with the 
number of surface Lewis-acid 
sites. 
It would also account for the 
low activity of 2-Nb205 (C1 not transferred) and the poor 
catalytic properties of silica-supported 1 and 2: indeed, silica 
does not present surface Lewis sites in the whole range of

temperatures of dehydroxylation studied here (< 
773 K). 
Identification of such cationic tungsten surface complexes is 
currently under investigation. 
Conclusion 
The interaction of the alkylidynetungsten(v1) 
complexes 1 and 
2 with the surface of inorganic oxides such as alumina, niobia 
and silica-alumina, which all present surface acid sites, leads 
to supported molecular complexes, presenting good catalytic 
activities for the metathesis of cis-pent-2-ene. A variety of 
different surface complexes are formed, making it difficult to 
determine unambiguously the precise nature of the precursor(s) 
of the active site(s). Surface Bronsted-acid sites are involved in 
the process of grafting of the complexes to the surface and/or 
intervene in the formation of surface neopentylidenetungsten 
complexes. Surface Lewis-acid sites, such as Nb5 
+ for example, 
most probably induce the formation of a tetravalent cationic 
neopentylidenetungsten(v1) complex, which may well be the 
precursor of the most active species, owing to its high electronic 
and co-ordinative unsaturation. Partial reduction of tungsten 
(VI) 
must be considered, but its mechanism of formation is still 
not clear. These studies clearly reveal the influence of the 
support on the catalytic properties of supported 1 and 2, by 
orienting the surface reaction preferentially towards one or 
the other surface complex. This is a well known situation in 
heterogeneous catalysis, although not always well understood.
