Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

The given literature does not contain any information about the alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text appears to be a bibliographic entry for an article about molybdenum and tungsten metathesis catalysts, which is not directly related to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of the mechanism, two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions based on the given information.

给出的文献中没有包含任何关于硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理的信息。这段文字似乎是一篇关于钼和钨复分解催化剂的文章的参考文献条目，与所问的问题没有直接关系。因此，我无法根据所给信息对机理、双位点和单位点方案、线性和环状烷烃转化过程中涉及的过程、关键中间体的形成和作用、以及这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能进行全面分析。

The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text appears to be a citation or reference to an article about molybdenum and tungsten metathesis catalysts, which is not directly related to the question asked. Without additional information about tantalum hydride catalysts, their mechanisms, or alkane metathesis processes, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question based solely on the given literature.

The given literature does not contain any information about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be a brief citation or reference to an article about molybdenum and tungsten metathesis catalysts, which is not relevant to the question asked. There is no content provided about tantalum hydrides, two-site or one-site schemes, linear and cyclic alkane transformations, or the formation of key intermediates in alkane metathesis. Therefore, this question cannot be answered using the given literature.
