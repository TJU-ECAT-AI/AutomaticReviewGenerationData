I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

and Fe- 
all indicates that a direct oxidative addi- 
tion pathway exists in addition to a-coordination. 
Furthermore, reductive elimination of the vinyl hydride 
can also lead directly to the a-olefin complex. Conse- 
quently, there must be two independent pathways for 
forming an olefin complex from free olefin and a co- 
ordinatively unsaturated metal: (1) 
direct a-complex- 
ation and (2) vinylic oxidative addition followed by 
intramolecular reductive elimination. It is also inter- 
esting to note that the microscopic reverse of this se- 
quence implies that olefin dissociation from the metal 
also can occur by two pathways, one of which involves 
intramolecular vinylic activation followed by reductive 
elimination of free olefin! 
Finally, the factors controlling intramolecular acti- 
vation of the C-H bond of a ligand remains poorly 
understood in a general sense. It is still not clear why 
species such as [Fe(PMe3),]37 and [ 
(C5Me5)Re- 
(PMe3)2]23C 
undergo cyclometalation whereas 
[ 
(C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] 
and [ 
(C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] 
do not. It

is also not clear why [(C5Me5)2W] 
metalates the C5Me5 
methyl 
whereas [ 
(C5Me5)Rh(PMe3)] 
and 
[(C5Me5)Ir(PMe3)] 
do not. It may be that relief of steric 
compression is the driving force for metalation of the 
PMe3 
ligand, a force that is not so important in the 
[ 
(C5Me5)M(PMe3)] 
intermediates. The more crowded 
[ 
(C5Me5)Re(PMe3)2] 
intermediate appears to sit in the 
middle, with both phosphine metalation and intermo- 
lecular hydrocarbon activation in balance. Further 
elucidation of this important side reaction is warranted.

<questions>


Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
