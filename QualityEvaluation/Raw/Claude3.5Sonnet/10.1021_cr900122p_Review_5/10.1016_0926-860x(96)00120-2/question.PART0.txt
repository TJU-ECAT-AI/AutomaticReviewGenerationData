Abstract 
The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a 
mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The relative amounts of each 
complex resultant from the reaction was determined by (a) reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 
to produce quantitatively a mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 which in turn were 
discriminated by mass spectroscopy, and (b) reaction of (--SiO)3Zrf3H 
7 with 02 followed by 
HC1 yielding 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield. Each of these methods indicated that 
( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation. The catalytic deuteration 
of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary 
C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds. A mechanism of 
degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation is invoked for the latter reaction.

1. Introduction 
Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was 
capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of 
the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]. 
This remarkable catalyst has been characterised on a molecular and atomic level 
by IR, CP-MAS IH and 3C NMR, EXAFS spectroscopies [5] as well as by 
microanalysis and other chemical assays and so we are able to write the exact 
formula for this catalyst, (-SiO)3ZrH, and its derivatives. The exceptional

properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are 
ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered 
(four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex. The objective of this 
study was to describe the regioselectivity on C-H bond activation by this 
complex toward a molecule like propane which presents primary and secondary 
C-H bonds. 
2. Results and discussion 
The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by 
infrared spectroscopy in situ. As described elsewhere, (= SiO)3Zr-H is prepared 
by heating = SiOZrNp3 under hydrogen (200 torr) at 165C for 3 h (spectrum 
(a) of Fig. 1) [1,2]. The reactor was evacuated and rigorously dry and oxygen-free 
propane (50 torr, excess) was added. Within an hour at room temperature the 
bands characteristic of the zirconium hydride (1630 cm -1) disappeared (spec- 
trum (b)) and a slight increase in the v(C-H) absorbances (2960 and 2871 
cm -1) was observed (see especially the difference spectrum, (c), in Fig. 1). 
To confirm that these subtle changes in the infrared spectrum were indeed 
due to the formation of a ( SiO)3Zr-H species, we synthesised the complex

under analogous conditions but on a larger scale (1 g of silica). A portion of this 
complex (80 mg, 1.5 wt.-% Zr, 1.3 • 10 -5 mol Zr) was introduced into each of 
two sealed glass tube reactors. A pressure of 200 torr of CH3CHzCH 3 was 
introduced into each cell. One was held at 30C, the other at 100C for 18 h. 
Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given 
off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as 
determined by GC/MS. The yield of propane with respect to grafted Zr 
adsorbed was 57% for the reaction run at 30C and 80% for the reaction at 
100C (Scheme 1). 
Careful examination of the primary fragmentation peaks (loss of methyl, 
29/30 m/e) allowed us to approximate the respective yields of (= SiO)3Zr- 
CH2CH2CH3-d I and (= SiO)3Zr-CH(CH3)2-d 1. The primary fragmentation 
peaks (and the most intense peaks overall) in the mass spectrum of propane are 
attributed to the loss of CH 3 (M-15, m/e = 29) and the loss of CH 4 (M-16, 
role = 28). These peaks appear with a relative ratio of 100:61. In the mass 
spectrum of the propane-d obtained by deuterolysis of the product of the 
reaction of propane with ( -- SiO)3Zr-H at 100C the most intense peaks in the 
mass spectrum were observed to be at role = 30 (M-15, loss of CH 3) and at 
role = 29 (M-16, loss of CH 4 or CH2D), with relative intensity ratio of 
68.2:100 (note the inversion with respect to propane-d0). The relative intensity 
of these two peaks is directly related to the relative abundance of CH 3CH 2CH2 D 
and (CH3)2(CHD) in the gas mixture (Scheme 2). The model displayed in 
Scheme 2 assumes that there is no kinetic isotope effect in the ionisation of 
propane molecules in the mass spectrometer; ionization here was by E1 at 70 eV 
and thus we neglect any kinetic isotope effect on this step. Eq. (a) is a reduced 
form of the relationship of the model. An exact solution of this equation (i% can 
be substituted by l-n%) for the observed ratio between the mass peaks at 29 and 
30 indicates a ratio between CH3CH2CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 of 49:1. The 
reader should appreciate that the model represented by Eq. (a) is very sensitive 
to small changes in the relative peak intensities. Given an error in the relative

In another study of the stoichiometric reaction of the hydride with propane, 
800 mg of (= SiO)3Zr-H (0.78 wt.-% Zr) was divided into three reactors. Two 
of these reactors were charged with 300 torr of propane and heated to 30C and 
100C respectively for 18 h. Then all three reactors were allowed to react with 
dry oxygen at room temperature. An immediate color change from faint yellow 
to white was observed. Portions of each of these samples were extracted with 
HC1 (1 M in ether) and analysed for alcohol product by gas chromatography. 
(We have previously determined that this treatment of oxidation and acidic 
extraction quantitatively produces alcohols from silica-supported zirconium 
alkyls.) 
No trace of propanol was detected in the extract of the reactor not treated 
with propane. Trace quantities of methanol, ethanol, and neopentanol, derived 
from the trace metal-alkyls present on the surface after the preparation (= 
SiO)3Zr-H, were detected. In the extract of the other two reactors, 1-propanol 
was the major product. The yields with respect to zirconium grafted were 7% for 
the reactor in which had been heated to 30C, 19% in the reactor which had

been heated to 100C 1. 2-propanol was detected only in the reactor heated at 
100C, in 0.5% yield. This indicates an n/iso selectivity of 38 for the activation 
of propane at 100C, in good accordance with that determined by mass 
spectroscopy of propane-d 1 above. 
We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hy- 
drogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of 
propane. A mixture of propane gas (44 torr, 7.46. 10 .4 mol) and deuterium 
(760 torr, 1.29. 10 .2 mol, D2/propane = 17.3) prepared in an airtight infrared 
cell attached to a sealed sample tube containing 85 mg of (--- SiO)3Zr-H (1.5 
wt.-% Zr, 1.4 • 10 .5 mol, propane/Zr-- 53). After the gases were fully mixed, 
the seal was broken exposing the gases to the catalyst and the reaction was 
followed by infrared spectroscopy of the gas phase (Fig. 2). Rapid disappear- 
ance of the bands in the region 3100-2700 cm - (v(C-H)) was accompanied 
by the appearance of bands in the region 2400-2000 cm -I (v(C-D)). The 
half-life of this catalytic deuteration was approximately 3 min representing about 
200 turnovers. 
Jens and Pyle have previously reported the catalytic partial deuteration of 
saturated alkanes in the presence of a catalyst which may very well have

contained some (- SiO)3Zr-H [6]. For propane, they report 10 turnovers of 
deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in 
the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C. 
Kinetic analysis of the catalytic deuteration experiment lends credence to the 
hypothesis that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane is regiose- 
lective. Two kinetic models were compared to the time dependence of the 
intensity of v(C-H) and v(C-D) absorbances in the infrared spectra. Several 
assumptions have been made in the development of the model and the interpreta- 
tion of the spectra. (a) The concentration of the catalyst is considered to be 
constant over the 4 h duration of the experiment. (b) The concentration of 
deuterium gas (initially in 17-fold excess, at equilibrium five-fold excess) is 
estimated to be constant. (c) The reaction is assumed to not be limited by gas 
diffusion. (d) Secondary kinetic isotope effects are negligible. (e) The reaction is 
first order in propane. (f) The integration of the entire v(C-H) (or v(C-D)) 
region is taken as an accurate measure of the concentration of C-H (or C-D) 
bonds present. The latter assumption requires that the various bands due to the 
stretching vibrations of different types of C-H bonds have similar extinction 
coeffients. This has been shown to be generally true in experimental studies and 
theoretical studies [7], (Note, it is not implied that v(C-H) extinction coeffi- 
cients are similar to v(C-D) extinction coefficients: they are not.) 
If there is no regioselectivity in the deuteration of propane and given the 
assumptions made above, the rate law for v(C-H) intensity, [CH]total, would be 
one of simple exponential decay dependent only on the initial concentration, 
[CH] 
, and the v(C-H) intensity as a function of time. (The model is described 
in the following Eqs. (b) and the decay given by the last equation.)

If the primary and secondary C-H bonds react at different rates, the model 
considers these to be two parallel first order reactions producing a two term rate 
law for the disappearance of v(C-H) intensity and appearance of v(C-D) 
intensity (Eq. (c)). Thus, the disappearance of v(C-H) intensity is described by 
a biexpontial decay dependent on the two effective rate constants, k,

emphasize the difference between the two decay models). One clearly sees that a 
single exponential decay inadequately describes the experimental data. The 
measured decay runs faster than the model early in the reaction, and much 
slower at longer times. The introduction of a second exponential term results in 
an excellent fit of the experimental data at both short and very long times 
(R = 0.998). The ratio between the effective rate constants, k, and k,2, is 
equal to the ratio between the first order rate constants, k]/k 2 (see Eq. 3), and 
represents the difference between the per carbon-hydrogen bond rate constants. 
This ratio was calculated to be 5.6. In terms of the n/iso type of selectivity 
determined in the stoichiometric experiments described above (thus taking into 
account that propane has six primary C-H bonds and only two secondary) one 
obtains an n/iso ratio of 16.8. 
Thus, for the catalytic deuteration of propane, we have shown a strong 
selectivity for primary carbon-hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, we must point out 
that the mechanism of catalytic deuteration does not need to be the same as that 
of the stoichiometric reactions. The activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by d o 
transition metal hydrides is normally described as a r-bond metathesis, that is, 
the C-H bond approached the Zr-H bond to form a four centered, four-electron 
intermediate. The selectivity determined by the analysis of the mass spectrum of 
propane-d 1 derived from the deuterolysis of (= SiO)3Zr-Pr and that determined 
by the conversion of (- SiO)3Zr-Pr to the corresponding alcohols necessarily 
pass through an intermediate zirconium-alkyl complex, (- SiO)3Zr-Pr, thus 
the selectivity is that on the formation of a zirconium-carbon bond (Scheme 3, 
upper right). In the case of the catalytic deuteration of propane, the carbon-hy- 
drogen bond activation step could also be degenerative (Scheme 3, left). The 
approach of a carbon-hydrogen bond to the zirconium-deuteride bond to form 
the four centered intermediate of the or-bond metathesis reaction can occur in 
two different orientations. In the classical C-H activation reaction, the carbon

approaches zirconium in the transition state and thus a metal-alkyl species is 
formed (Scheme 3, right), which would necessarily be the carbon-hydrogen 
activation step in the stoichiometric determination of selectivity. In this mecha- 
nism, deuterium is transferred to the propyl fragment in a second step hy- 
drogenolysis of the zirconium-carbon bond. The catalytic deuteration reaction 
can, however, take place by a degenerative activation step in which it is the 
hydrogen of the C-H bond which approaches zirconium and the deuterium is 
simultaneously transferred to propane. This type of activation has been previ- 
ously suggested for group 3 and 4 metal hydrides [8-15]. 
We would be remiss if we did not point out that we cannot eliminate the 
possibility that the selectivity observed for all of these reactions reflects a 
thermally 
equilibrated 
mixture 
of (= SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 
and 
(= 
SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3. It is quite possible that the initial C-H bond activation 
step is followed by rapid [3-hydride elimination and alkyl reinsertion (Scheme 
4). Indeed theoretical calculations on scandium n-propyl and iso-propyl frag- 
ments [16] indicate that the scandium-carbon ScCH2CH2CH  is 8.5 kcal/mol 
stronger than that of ScCH(CH3)-. 
The same theoretical study points out that the most stable conformers of the 
+ fragment are those in which the terminal methyl group of the 
ScCH2CH2CH 
3 
propyl chain is turned back toward the scandium center, acting as a weak ligand 
for the electron poor metal center. Thus we could suggest, as does Beauchamp 
in his study of the o--bond metathesis reactions of ScR- in the gas phase 
[17,18], that primary C-H bond activation is favored by the stabilisation of the 
electron poor zirconium by interaction with the nonreactant terminal methyl 
group of propane (Scheme 5, left). 
We have shown that the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds by 
(= SiO)3Zr-H is selective for primary over secondary C-H bonds by three

3. Experimental details 
3.1. General 
All manipulations and reactions were conducted in the absence of solvent 
under strictly controlled atmosphere or vacuum conditions. Sealed tube reactors 
are used throughout. The extremely air and water sensitive surface supported 
zirconium propyl complexes were stored in sealed pyrex break-seal tubes 
well-adapted to the construction of secondary reactors (for the chemical assays 
of the surface complex). ( = SiO)3Zr-C3H 7 showed no evidence of decomposi- 
tion when stored for a period of 2 weeks at -40C in such tubes. Infrared 
spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna IR 550 FT spectrometer equipped 
with a cell designed for in situ preparations under controlled atmosphere [19]. 
Gas phase analysis was performed on a Intersmat IGC 121 FL equipped with a 
flame ionization detector and a AIzO3/KC1 on fused silica column (50 m × 0.32 
mm, for light alkanes) or Carbowax column (25 m X 0.32 mm, for alcohols). 
Elemental analyses were performed by the Central Analysis Service of the 
CNRS at Solaize. Mass spectra were recorded on a quadrupole analyser 
(Supravac VG) connected to a vacuum system able to maintain a residual 
pressure of 10-0 torr. 
Silica (Degussa, 200 mZ/g) was treated under vacuum (10 -5 torr) at 500C 
for 15 h. Silica thus treated has been determined to have surface hydroxyl 
concentration of 20H/nm 2 as determined by the titration with LiA1H 4 (silica 
characteristics are provided by DEGUSSA (technical note)). Zr(CHzC(CH3)3) 4 
[20], (= SiO)3Zr(CH2C(CH3)3) 3 [21] and (-SiO)3Zr-H)[1] were prepared by 
previously published methods. 
3.2. Reaction of ( - SiO)3Zr-H with propane 
Rigorously dry and deoxygenated propane (50 torr, 800 Ixmol) was intro- 
duced via an activated zeolite to an infrared cell/reactor containing ( - SiO)3Zr- 
H (roughly 2 txmol). Infrared spectra indicate that the reaction within one h at 
room temperature the stretching band of (-SiO)3Zr-H (1630 cm -I) had 
disappeared. 
3.3. Reaction of (-SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D:O 
Rigorously dry and deoxygenated propane (200 torr, 750 Ixmol) was intro- 
duced via an activated zeolithe to a reactor containing (- SiO)3Zr-H (80 mg,

roughly 10 mol). The reactor was closed and held at a given temperature for 
18 h to produce (= SiO)3Zrf3n 7, a very pale yellow powder. Gases were 
removed by vacuum and each sample exposed to D20 vapor. 
3.4. Reaction of ( =- SiO)3ZrC3H7 with oxygen and HCI 
Rigorously dry and deoxygenated propane (300 torr, 1100 mol) was intro- 
duced via an activated zeolithe to a reactor containing (= SiO)3Zr-H (250 mg, 
roughly 30 txmol). The reactor was closed and held at a given temperature for 
18 h to produce (--SiO)3ZrC3H 7. Gases were removed by vacuum and each 
sample exposed to dry 0 2 
. The yellowish powder turned white immediately. 
The powder was transferred in air into a test tube, then extracted with etheric 
HC1 (1 M). Products in the ether extract were quantified by GC. 
3.5. Catalytic deuteration of propane 
Rigorously dry and deoxygenated propane (44 torr, 750 p, 
mol) and deuterium 
(95%D, 760 torr, 1300 pmol) were introduced via an activated zeolithe to an 
infrared cell/reactor attached to a break-seal tube containing ( = SiO)3Zr-H (85 
mg, 14 p, 
mol). Thirty minutes after the addition of deuterium and after an 
infrared spectrum of the gases had been obtained, the seal was broken and the 
cell placed in the infrared spectrometer for the duration of the experiment. 
Infrared spectra were taken at regular intervals for one h (when equilibrium had 
been established).
