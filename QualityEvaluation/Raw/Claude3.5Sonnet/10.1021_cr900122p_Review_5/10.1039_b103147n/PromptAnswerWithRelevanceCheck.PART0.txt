Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be a general overview of alkane CH activation and functionalization with homogeneous transition metal catalysts, but does not provide specific details about the mechanism requested in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately answer the question about the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis, two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation of key intermediates, or factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

所给的文献中没有包含任何关于硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的信息。该文档似乎是对均相过渡金属催化剂烷烃CH活化和官能化的一般性概述，但并未提供问题中所要求的具体机理细节。由于所提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法准确回答关于烷烃复分解的全面机理、双位点和单位点方案、直链和环状烷烃转化过程、关键中间体的形成以及这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中反应选择性和催化剂性能的问题。
