[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "With [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[3] "As observed for Ta, linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivities for higher homologues are as follows: Cn+1>Cn+2≥Cn+3. These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[4] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

[5] "These data corroborate what we observed and proposed earlier: alkane metathesis proceeds via carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] acts as the catalyst precursor, which is highly electrophilic and capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. Formation of metallocarbenes: The activation of alkanes leads to the formation of tantalum alkylidene (metallocarbene) species.

3. Olefin formation: These metallocarbenes can undergo β-hydride elimination to form olefins, which are key intermediates in the process.

4. Metallacyclobutane formation: The metallocarbenes react with olefins to form metallacyclobutane intermediates. The favored pathway involves 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes rather than 1,2-disubstituted ones.

5. Product formation: The metallacyclobutanes then undergo cycloreversion to form new olefins and regenerate the metallocarbene species.

6. Termination: The newly formed olefins can be hydrogenated to form alkane products.

This mechanism explains the observed selectivity in the reaction:

- Linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes because the formation of branched products would require less-reactive disubstituted carbenes.
- The selectivity for higher homologues follows the order Cn+1 > Cn+2 ≥ Cn+3, which is consistent with the proposed metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The mechanism is primarily based on a one-site scheme, where all steps occur on a single tantalum center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism, involving cooperation between two tantalum centers on the surface, cannot be completely ruled out based on the provided information.

This mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, with the key difference being the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed.

The catalyst performance is influenced by the electrophilicity of the tantalum center and its ability to form and stabilize the key metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the relative stability and reactivity of these intermediates, which favor the formation of linear products and specific chain length distributions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和中间体：

1. 引发：钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]作为催化剂前体，具有高度亲电性，能够活化烷烃C-H键。

2. 金属卡宾的形成：烷烃的活化导致钽烯基（金属卡宾）物种的形成。

3. 烯烃形成：这些金属卡宾可以经过β-氢消除形成烯烃，这是过程中的关键中间体。

4. 金属环丁烷的形成：金属卡宾与烯烃反应形成金属环丁烷中间体。优先路径涉及1,3-二取代金属环丁烷，而不是1,2-二取代金属环丁烷。

5. 产物形成：金属环丁烷然后经历环反转，形成新的烯烃并再生金属卡宾物种。

6. 终止：新形成的烯烃可以被氢化形成烷烃产物。

这种机制解释了反应中观察到的选择性：

- 线性烷烃优于支链烷烃，因为形成支链产物需要反应性较低的二取代卡宾。
- 高级同系物的选择性遵循Cn+1 > Cn+2 ≥ Cn+3的顺序，这与提出的金属环丁烷中间体一致。

该机制主要基于单位点方案，其中所有步骤都发生在单个钽中心上。然而，基于所提供的信息，不能完全排除涉及表面上两个钽中心合作的双位点机制的可能性。

这种机制允许线性和环状烷烃转化，关键区别在于形成的金属环丁烷中间体的性质。

催化剂性能受钽中心的亲电性以及其形成和稳定关键金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的能力的影响。反应的选择性由这些中间体的相对稳定性和反应性决定，这有利于线性产物的形成和特定链长分布。
