[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologuesan alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "With [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[3] "The selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[4] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps that contribute to the transformation of alkanes into their higher and lower homologues. The process is believed to proceed through a combination of olefin metathesis-like intermediates, including metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutanes.

The reaction begins with the activation of the alkane by the highly electrophilic tantalum hydride species [(SiO)2TaH]. This leads to the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, which can then undergo β-hydrogen elimination to generate metal-alkylidene (carbene) species and alkenes.

The key step in the catalytic cycle involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates through the reaction of metal-alkylidene species with alkenes. The model proposed for this process suggests that 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are favored over 1,2-disubstituted ones, which explains the observed selectivity towards linear products and higher homologues.

The metallacyclobutane intermediates can then undergo retro-[2+2] cycloaddition to form new metal-alkylidene species and alkenes. These products can either desorb from the catalyst surface or participate in further reactions, leading to the formation of higher and lower alkane homologues.

The selectivity of the reaction towards linear products over branched compounds is attributed to the lower reactivity of disubstituted carbenes, which would be required for the formation of branched products. This preference for linear products is consistent with the proposed mechanism involving 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss two-site versus one-site schemes, the mechanism described appears to be primarily based on a one-site model, where individual tantalum centers catalyze the entire process. However, the possibility of interactions between adjacent sites on the silica surface cannot be ruled out.

The performance and selectivity of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the electrophilicity of the tantalum center, the stability of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, and the relative rates of formation and decomposition of these intermediates. These factors contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalyst in transforming alkanes into their higher and lower homologues while maintaining selectivity towards linear products.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及一系列复杂的步骤，这些步骤促进了烷烃向其高级和低级同系物的转化。该过程被认为是通过烯烃复分解类似的中间体进行的，包括金属卡宾和金属环丁烷。

反应始于高度亲电的钽氢化物物种[(SiO)2TaH]对烷烃的活化。这导致形成金属-烷基中间体，然后可以通过β-氢消除生成金属-烷叉（卡宾）物种和烯烃。

催化循环的关键步骤涉及通过金属-烷叉物种与烯烃反应形成金属环丁烷中间体。为这个过程提出的模型表明，1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更受青睐，这解释了观察到的对线性产物和高级同系物的选择性。

金属环丁烷中间体随后可以进行逆[2+2]环加成，形成新的金属-烷叉物种和烯烃。这些产物可以从催化剂表面脱附或参与进一步的反应，导致形成更高和更低的烷烃同系物。

反应对线性产物而非支链化合物的选择性归因于二取代卡宾的反应性较低，而形成支链产物需要这种二取代卡宾。这种对线性产物的偏好与涉及1,3-二取代金属环丁烷的提议机制一致。

虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点与单位点方案，但所描述的机制主要基于单位点模型，其中单个钽中心催化整个过程。然而，不能排除二氧化硅表面相邻位点之间相互作用的可能性。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受到诸如钽中心的亲电性、金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性以及这些中间体形成和分解的相对速率等因素的影响。这些因素共同影响催化剂将烷烃转化为其高级和低级同系物的整体效率，同时保持对线性产物的选择性。
