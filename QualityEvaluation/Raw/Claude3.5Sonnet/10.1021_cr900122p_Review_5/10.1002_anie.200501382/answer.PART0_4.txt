[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon–carbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."

[3] "With [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[4] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[5] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Initial activation: The silica-supported tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] acts as a highly electrophilic species capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. C-C bond cleavage and formation: The catalyst selectively cleaves and forms carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes, resulting in the transformation of a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.

3. Metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates: The key step in alkane metathesis involves the formation of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to those observed in olefin metathesis.

4. Favored pathway for higher homologues: The formation of higher homologues preferentially occurs through a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one.

5. Linear vs. branched selectivity: The mechanism favors the formation of linear alkanes over branched ones, as the latter would require less-reactive disubstituted carbenes.

6. Product distribution: In the case of propane metathesis, the reaction selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:

1. The electrophilicity of the tantalum hydride species, which enables efficient C-H bond activation.
2. The preference for 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to the formation of higher homologues.
3. The relative reactivity of different carbene species, favoring linear over branched products.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss two-site and one-site schemes or the specific processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations, the overall mechanism suggests a single-site catalytic process centered on the tantalum atom. The formation of alkene intermediates is implied in the mechanism, as they are necessary precursors to the metallacyclobutane intermediates involved in the key C-C bond formation and cleavage steps.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 初始活化：二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]作为一种高度亲电的物种，能够活化烷烃C-H键。

2. C-C键断裂和形成：催化剂选择性地断裂和形成烷烃中的碳-碳键，导致给定烷烃转化为其更高和更低的同系物。

3. 金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体：烷烃复分解的关键步骤涉及金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的形成，类似于烯烃复分解中观察到的情况。

4. 更高同系物的优先途径：更高同系物的形成优先通过1,3-二取代金属环丁烷中间体进行，而不是1,2-二取代中间体。

5. 直链与支链选择性：该机理倾向于形成直链烷烃而非支链烷烃，因为后者需要反应性较低的二取代卡宾。

6. 产物分布：在丙烷复分解的情况下，反应选择性地生成乙烷（45-50%）和丁烷（30-35%），以及甲烷和少量更高的烷烃。

反应选择性和催化剂性能受以下因素影响：

1. 钽氢化物物种的亲电性，使其能够有效活化C-H键。
2. 对1,3-二取代金属环丁烷中间体的偏好，导致形成更高的同系物。
3. 不同卡宾物种的相对反应性，有利于直链产物而非支链产物。

虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点和单位点方案或环烷烃转化涉及的具体过程，但整体机理表明这是一个以钽原子为中心的单位点催化过程。烯烃中间体的形成在机理中是隐含的，因为它们是形成金属环丁烷中间体的必要前体，而金属环丁烷中间体参与关键的C-C键形成和断裂步骤。
