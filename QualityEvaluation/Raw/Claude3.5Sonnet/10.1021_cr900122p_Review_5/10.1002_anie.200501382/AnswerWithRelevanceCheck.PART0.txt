          [1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon–carbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."

[3] "With [(SiO)Ta(CH–tBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[4] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[5] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

          The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps:

1. Initiation: The highly electrophilic tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] supported on silica acts as the catalyst precursor, capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. C-C Bond Activation: The catalyst selectively cleaves and forms carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes.

3. Formation of Key Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis.

4. Metallacyclobutane Formation: The favored pathway for forming higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one.

5. Product Formation: The metallacyclobutanes undergo cycloreversion to form new alkanes and regenerate the active catalyst species.

6. Selectivity: The mechanism favors the formation of linear alkanes over branched ones, as branched compounds would require less-reactive disubstituted carbenes.

7. Product Distribution: In propane metathesis, for example, the reaction selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.

The mechanism appears to primarily follow a one-site scheme, where all steps occur on a single tantalum center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism involving cooperation between adjacent tantalum centers cannot be completely ruled out based on the provided information.

For both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the key steps involve the formation of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The main difference would likely be in the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed from cyclic alkanes.

The catalyst performance and selectivity are influenced by factors such as:
- The electrophilicity of the tantalum center
- The stability and reactivity of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates
- The preference for 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones
- The relative rates of formation and decomposition of various intermediates

These factors contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalyst in transforming alkanes into their higher and lower homologues while maintaining selectivity towards linear products.

          由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及一系列复杂的步骤：

1. 启动：高度亲电的二氧化硅支撑钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]作为催化剂前体，能够活化烷烃C-H键。

2. C-C键活化：催化剂选择性地断裂和形成烷烃中的碳-碳键。

3. 关键中间体的形成：反应通过金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体进行，类似于烯烃复分解。

4. 金属环丁烷形成：形成更高同系物的优先途径涉及1,3-二取代金属环丁烷中间体，而不是1,2-二取代的。

5. 产物形成：金属环丁烷经历环反转，形成新的烷烃并再生活性催化剂物种。

6. 选择性：该机制有利于直链烷烃的形成而不是支链烷烃，因为支链化合物需要反应性较低的二取代卡宾。

7. 产物分布：例如，在丙烷复分解中，反应选择性地生成乙烷（45-50%）和丁烷（30-35%），以及甲烷和少量更高的烷烃。

该机制似乎主要遵循单位点方案，所有步骤都在单个钽中心上进行。然而，基于提供的信息，不能完全排除涉及相邻钽中心合作的双位点机制的可能性。

对于直链和环状烷烃转化，关键步骤都涉及金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的形成。主要区别可能在于由环状烷烃形成的金属环丁烷中间体的性质。

催化剂性能和选择性受以下因素影响：
- 钽中心的亲电性
- 金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性
- 1,3-二取代金属环丁烷相对于1,2-二取代金属环丁烷的优先性
- 各种中间体形成和分解的相对速率

这些因素共同影响催化剂将烷烃转化为其高级和低级同系物的整体效率，同时保持对直链产物的选择性。
