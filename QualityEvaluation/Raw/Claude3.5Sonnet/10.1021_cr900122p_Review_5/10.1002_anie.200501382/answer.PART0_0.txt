[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon–carbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."

[3] "With [(SiO)Ta(CH–tBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[4] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[5] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

The alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that combines aspects of both one-site and two-site schemes. The process begins with the activation of alkanes by the highly electrophilic tantalum hydride species [(SiO)2TaH] supported on silica. This catalyst is capable of selectively cleaving and forming carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes.

The mechanism primarily involves the formation of key intermediates such as metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutanes, similar to those observed in olefin metathesis. These intermediates play a crucial role in the transformation of alkanes into their higher and lower homologues. The formation of these intermediates likely occurs through a series of steps involving C-H bond activation, β-hydride elimination, and olefin formation.

For linear alkane transformations, the favored pathway involves the formation of a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate. This preference explains the higher selectivity observed for linear products over branched ones. Cyclic alkane transformations would likely involve similar intermediates, although they may require additional ring-opening steps.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates. The model predicts that 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are more favorable for the formation of higher homologues compared to 1,2-disubstituted ones. This preference contributes to the observed product distribution, where linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivity for higher homologues follows the order Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3.

The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is affected by several factors. The electrophilicity of the tantalum center plays a crucial role in activating the C-H bonds of alkanes. The support material (silica in this case) also influences the catalyst's activity and stability. The formation and stability of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates are key determinants of catalyst efficiency and product selectivity.

In propane metathesis, for example, the catalyst selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) as the main products, along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes. This distribution reflects the balance between different reaction pathways and the stability of various intermediates formed during the catalytic cycle.

Overall, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a delicate interplay between alkane activation, formation of olefinic intermediates, and subsequent metathesis reactions. The selectivity and efficiency of the process are governed by the nature of the metal center, the support material, and the specific reaction conditions employed.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解涉及一种复杂的机理，结合了单位点和双位点方案的特点。该过程始于高度亲电的硅胶负载钽氢化物物种[(SiO)2TaH]对烷烃的活化。这种催化剂能够选择性地断裂和形成烷烃中的碳-碳键。

该机理主要涉及金属卡宾和金属杂环丁烷等关键中间体的形成，类似于烯烃复分解中观察到的中间体。这些中间体在烷烃向其高级和低级同系物转化过程中起着关键作用。这些中间体的形成可能通过一系列步骤进行，包括C-H键活化、β-氢消除和烯烃形成。

对于直链烷烃的转化，优先路径涉及1,3-二取代金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成。这种偏好解释了直链产物比支链产物具有更高的选择性。环烷烃的转化可能涉及类似的中间体，尽管可能需要额外的开环步骤。

反应的选择性受金属杂环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性的影响。该模型预测，与1,2-二取代金属杂环丁烷相比，1,3-二取代金属杂环丁烷更有利于形成高级同系物。这种偏好导致了观察到的产物分布，其中直链烷烃优于支链烷烃，高级同系物的选择性遵循Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3的顺序。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能受多个因素影响。钽中心的亲电性在活化烷烃的C-H键方面起着关键作用。载体材料（在本例中为硅胶）也影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。金属卡宾和金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成和稳定性是决定催化剂效率和产物选择性的关键因素。

例如，在丙烷复分解中，催化剂选择性地生成乙烷（45-50%）和丁烷（30-35%）作为主要产物，同时伴有甲烷和少量高级烷烃。这种分布反映了不同反应途径之间的平衡以及催化循环中形成的各种中间体的稳定性。

总的来说，硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及烷烃活化、烯烃中间体形成和随后的复分解反应之间的微妙相互作用。该过程的选择性和效率由金属中心的性质、载体材料和所采用的特定反应条件决定。
