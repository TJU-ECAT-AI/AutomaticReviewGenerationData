[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "With [(SiO)Ta(CHtBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[3] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[4] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

[5] "These data corroborate what we observed and proposed earlier: alkane metathesis proceeds via carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes and intermediates:

1. Initial activation: The silica-supported tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] acts as the catalyst precursor, which is highly electrophilic and capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. Formation of key intermediates: The reaction proceeds through the formation of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to the mechanism of olefin metathesis.

3. Alkene intermediates: Although not explicitly stated, the formation of alkene intermediates is implied, as they are necessary for the olefin metathesis-like steps in the mechanism.

4. Metallacyclobutane formation: The favored pathway for forming higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one.

5. Product selectivity: The mechanism favors the formation of linear alkanes over branched ones, as branched compounds would require the formation of less reactive disubstituted carbenes.

6. Cyclic vs. linear alkanes: The document does not provide specific information on the differences in mechanism between cyclic and linear alkane transformations.

7. Two-site vs. one-site schemes: The literature does not explicitly discuss two-site or one-site schemes for the mechanism.

8. Catalyst performance: The tantalum-based catalysts show good activity in alkane metathesis, with the ability to transform alkanes into both higher and lower homologues.

This mechanism explains the observed selectivity in product formation and the catalyst's ability to perform alkane metathesis. However, the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of two-site and one-site schemes or detailed information on cyclic alkane transformations.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程和中间体：

1. 初始活化：二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物[(SiO)2TaH]作为催化剂前体，具有高度亲电性，能够活化烷烃C-H键。

2. 关键中间体的形成：反应通过金属卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的形成进行，类似于烯烃复分解的机理。

3. 烯烃中间体：虽然没有明确说明，但暗示了烯烃中间体的形成，因为它们是机理中类似烯烃复分解步骤所必需的。

4. 金属环丁烷的形成：形成更高同系物的优先途径涉及1,3-二取代金属环丁烷中间体，而不是1,2-二取代的。

5. 产物选择性：该机理有利于直链烷烃的形成而不是支链烷烃，因为支链化合物需要形成反应性较低的二取代卡宾。

6. 环烷烃与直链烷烃：文献没有提供环烷烃和直链烷烃转化机理差异的具体信息。

7. 双位点与单位点方案：文献没有明确讨论机理的双位点或单位点方案。

8. 催化剂性能：基于钽的催化剂在烷烃复分解中表现出良好的活性，能够将烷烃转化为更高和更低的同系物。

这种机理解释了产物形成的观察到的选择性和催化剂进行烷烃复分解的能力。然而，文献并未提供双位点和单位点方案的全面比较，也没有详细介绍环烷烃转化的信息。
