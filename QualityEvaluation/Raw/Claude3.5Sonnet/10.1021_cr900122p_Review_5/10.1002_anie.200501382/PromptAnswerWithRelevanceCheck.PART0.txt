[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[3] "With [(SiO)Ta(CH–tBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[4] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

The alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that combines aspects of both one-site and two-site schemes. The process begins with the activation of alkanes by the highly electrophilic tantalum hydride species [(SiO)2TaH] supported on silica. This catalyst is capable of selectively cleaving and forming carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes.

The mechanism primarily involves the formation of key intermediates such as metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutanes, similar to those observed in olefin metathesis. These intermediates play a crucial role in the transformation of alkanes into their higher and lower homologues. The formation of these intermediates likely occurs through a series of steps involving C-H bond activation, β-hydride elimination, and olefin formation.

For linear alkane transformations, the favored pathway involves the formation of a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate. This preference explains the higher selectivity observed for linear products over branched ones. Cyclic alkane transformations would likely involve similar intermediates, although they may require additional ring-opening steps.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates. The model predicts that 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are more favorable for the formation of higher homologues compared to 1,2-disubstituted ones. This preference contributes to the observed product distribution, where linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes, and the selectivity for higher homologues follows the order Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3.

The catalyst performance in various alkane conversions is affected by several factors. The electrophilicity of the tantalum center plays a crucial role in activating the C-H bonds of alkanes. The support material (silica in this case) also influences the catalyst's activity and stability. The formation and stability of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates are key determinants of catalyst efficiency and product selectivity.

In propane metathesis, for example, the catalyst selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) as the main products, along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes. This distribution reflects the balance between different reaction pathways and the stability of various intermediates formed during the catalytic cycle.

Overall, the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a delicate interplay between alkane activation, formation of olefinic intermediates, and subsequent metathesis reactions. The selectivity and efficiency of the process are governed by the nature of the metal center, the support material, and the specific reaction conditions employed.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解涉及一种复杂的机理，结合了单位点和双位点方案的特点。该过程始于高度亲电的硅胶负载钽氢化物物种[(SiO)2TaH]对烷烃的活化。这种催化剂能够选择性地断裂和形成烷烃中的碳-碳键。

该机理主要涉及金属卡宾和金属杂环丁烷等关键中间体的形成，类似于烯烃复分解中观察到的中间体。这些中间体在烷烃向其高级和低级同系物转化过程中起着关键作用。这些中间体的形成可能通过一系列步骤进行，包括C-H键活化、β-氢消除和烯烃形成。

对于直链烷烃的转化，优先路径涉及1,3-二取代金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成。这种偏好解释了直链产物比支链产物具有更高的选择性。环烷烃的转化可能涉及类似的中间体，尽管可能需要额外的开环步骤。

反应的选择性受金属杂环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性的影响。该模型预测，与1,2-二取代金属杂环丁烷相比，1,3-二取代金属杂环丁烷更有利于形成高级同系物。这种偏好导致了观察到的产物分布，其中直链烷烃优于支链烷烃，高级同系物的选择性遵循Cn+1 > Cn+2 > Cn+3的顺序。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能受多个因素影响。钽中心的亲电性在活化烷烃的C-H键方面起着关键作用。载体材料（在本例中为硅胶）也影响催化剂的活性和稳定性。金属卡宾和金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成和稳定性是决定催化剂效率和产物选择性的关键因素。

例如，在丙烷复分解中，催化剂选择性地生成乙烷（45-50%）和丁烷（30-35%）作为主要产物，同时伴有甲烷和少量高级烷烃。这种分布反映了不同反应途径之间的平衡以及催化循环中形成的各种中间体的稳定性。

总的来说，硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及烷烃活化、烯烃中间体形成和随后的复分解反应之间的微妙相互作用。该过程的选择性和效率由金属中心的性质、载体材料和所采用的特定反应条件决定。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps that contribute to the transformation of alkanes into their higher and lower homologues. The process is believed to proceed through a combination of olefin metathesis-like intermediates, including metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutanes.

The reaction begins with the activation of the alkane by the highly electrophilic tantalum hydride species [(SiO)2TaH]. This leads to the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, which can then undergo β-hydrogen elimination to generate metal-alkylidene (carbene) species and alkenes.

The key step in the catalytic cycle involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates through the reaction of metal-alkylidene species with alkenes. The model proposed for this process suggests that 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are favored over 1,2-disubstituted ones, which explains the observed selectivity towards linear products and higher homologues.

The metallacyclobutane intermediates can then undergo retro-[2+2] cycloaddition to form new metal-alkylidene species and alkenes. These products can either desorb from the catalyst surface or participate in further reactions, leading to the formation of higher and lower alkane homologues.

The selectivity of the reaction towards linear products over branched compounds is attributed to the lower reactivity of disubstituted carbenes, which would be required for the formation of branched products. This preference for linear products is consistent with the proposed mechanism involving 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss two-site versus one-site schemes, the mechanism described appears to be primarily based on a one-site model, where individual tantalum centers catalyze the entire process. However, the possibility of interactions between adjacent sites on the silica surface cannot be ruled out.

The performance and selectivity of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the electrophilicity of the tantalum center, the stability of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, and the relative rates of formation and decomposition of these intermediates. These factors contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalyst in transforming alkanes into their higher and lower homologues while maintaining selectivity towards linear products.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及一系列复杂的步骤，这些步骤促进了烷烃向其高级和低级同系物的转化。该过程被认为是通过烯烃复分解类似的中间体进行的，包括金属卡宾和金属环丁烷。

反应始于高度亲电的钽氢化物物种[(SiO)2TaH]对烷烃的活化。这导致形成金属-烷基中间体，然后可以通过β-氢消除生成金属-烷叉（卡宾）物种和烯烃。

催化循环的关键步骤涉及通过金属-烷叉物种与烯烃反应形成金属环丁烷中间体。为这个过程提出的模型表明，1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更受青睐，这解释了观察到的对线性产物和高级同系物的选择性。

金属环丁烷中间体随后可以进行逆[2+2]环加成，形成新的金属-烷叉物种和烯烃。这些产物可以从催化剂表面脱附或参与进一步的反应，导致形成更高和更低的烷烃同系物。

反应对线性产物而非支链化合物的选择性归因于二取代卡宾的反应性较低，而形成支链产物需要这种二取代卡宾。这种对线性产物的偏好与涉及1,3-二取代金属环丁烷的提议机制一致。

虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点与单位点方案，但所描述的机制主要基于单位点模型，其中单个钽中心催化整个过程。然而，不能排除二氧化硅表面相邻位点之间相互作用的可能性。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受到诸如钽中心的亲电性、金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性以及这些中间体形成和分解的相对速率等因素的影响。这些因素共同影响催化剂将烷烃转化为其高级和低级同系物的整体效率，同时保持对线性产物的选择性。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] acts as the catalyst precursor, which is highly electrophilic and capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. Formation of metallocarbenes: The activation of alkanes leads to the formation of tantalum alkylidene (metallocarbene) species.

3. Olefin formation: These metallocarbenes can undergo β-hydride elimination to form olefins, which are key intermediates in the process.

4. Metallacyclobutane formation: The metallocarbenes react with olefins to form metallacyclobutane intermediates. The favored pathway involves 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes rather than 1,2-disubstituted ones.

5. Product formation: The metallacyclobutanes then undergo cycloreversion to form new olefins and regenerate the metallocarbene species.

6. Termination: The newly formed olefins can be hydrogenated to form alkane products.

This mechanism explains the observed selectivity in the reaction:

- Linear alkanes are favored over branched alkanes because the formation of branched products would require less-reactive disubstituted carbenes.
- The selectivity for higher homologues follows the order Cn+1 > Cn+2 ≥ Cn+3, which is consistent with the proposed metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The mechanism is primarily based on a one-site scheme, where all steps occur on a single tantalum center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism, involving cooperation between two tantalum centers on the surface, cannot be completely ruled out based on the provided information.

This mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, with the key difference being the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed.

The catalyst performance is influenced by the electrophilicity of the tantalum center and its ability to form and stabilize the key metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The selectivity of the reaction is determined by the relative stability and reactivity of these intermediates, which favor the formation of linear products and specific chain length distributions.

该机制主要基于单位点方案，其中所有步骤都发生在单个钽中心上。然而，基于所提供的信息，不能完全排除涉及表面上两个钽中心合作的双位点机制的可能性。

这种机制允许线性和环状烷烃转化，关键区别在于形成的金属环丁烷中间体的性质。
