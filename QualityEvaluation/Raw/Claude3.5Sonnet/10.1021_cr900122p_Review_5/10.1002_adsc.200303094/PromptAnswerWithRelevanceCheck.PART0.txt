Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

This literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text primarily discusses various catalytic methods for C-H bond functionalization, including C-H/olefin coupling, C-H/acetylene coupling, carbonylation, arylation, dehydrogenation of alkanes, silylation, and borylation of C-H bonds. It does not mention tantalum hydride catalysts or alkane metathesis mechanisms.

The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document primarily discusses various catalytic methods for C-H bond functionalization, including C-H/olefin coupling, C-H/acetylene coupling, carbonylation, arylation, dehydrogenation of alkanes, silylation, and borylation. It does not cover the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis using tantalum catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of the comprehensive mechanism, two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation of key intermediates, or factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance for this particular reaction based on the given information.
