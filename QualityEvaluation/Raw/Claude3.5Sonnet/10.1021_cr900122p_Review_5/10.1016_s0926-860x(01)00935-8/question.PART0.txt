Abstract
This paper presents the results of a study of the methanedeuterium exchange reaction for a range of metal oxides.
Interestingly, particularly with respect to their potential dehydrogenation role in other catalytic systems, Ga2O3 was found
to be the most active by a considerable margin followed by ZnO. The results indicate that the oxide basicity may be an
important factor in the activation of methane, although basicity arguments cannot be used to rationalise the dataset as a whole.

1. Introduction
The H/D exchange reaction of CH4 with D2 has
been extensively studied over metal catalysts for
many years. There is little doubt remaining that ex-
change in such systems takes place via an adsorbed
radical intermediate [1]. Deuterated products in these
reaction systems often include singly and multiply
exchanged species. It is widely considered that the
latter species originate from the conversion of surface
methyl radicals to surface methylene radicals, and
ultimately by interconversion to more highly dissoci-
ated species, which subsequently react with surface
deuterium atoms.
In contrast to the exchange reaction over met-
als, oxides have not received the same degree of
attention. Possibly the most studied oxide has been
-Al2O3. Kemball and co-workers [2] have shown

that exchange occurred readily in the temperature
range 1183 C when using a batch reactor. The ac-
tivation energy for this process was reported to be
17  4 kJ mol1. Other hydrocarbons were studied
and were found to have higher activation energies, e.g.
C3H8 Ea = 36  4 kJ mol1. When normalised for
the surface area of the oxides, the rates for hydrocar-
bon exchange at 25 C were all of similar magnitude
for these hydrocarbons. A dependence of exchange
reactivity with hydrocarbon structure was explained
qualitatively by considering the order of stability of
the intermediate carbanions. CH3was found to be
the most stable, and consequently methane showed the
highest degree of exchange. In a further study using
-Al2O3, predominantly directed towards CH4/CD4
exchange, Larson and Hall showed that a primary ki-
netic isotope effect was apparent [3]. These observa-
tions suggest that the rate determining step was CH
bond breaking, and interestingly it was suggested
that hydroxyl groups were implicated in methane

activation. Burwell and co-workers [4,5] have ex-
tensively studied the exchange of hydrocarbons over
chromium oxide gel. Although mainly dealing with
higher alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes and stereo-
chemical effects, methane was also included [4]. The
Cr2O3 gel was activated by heating in an inert dry
gas or in vacuo above 300 C. Maximum activity was
observed after pre-treatment was carried out at, or
above, 470 C. Once activated, the oxide was effec-
tive for exchange at temperatures above 200 C. The
alkanes showed two distinct types of exchange, these
were a single exchange process producing a random
distribution of deuterium in the substrate and multi-
ple exchange. Single exchange was observed with all
alkanes and was the exclusive process with CH4. At
235 C, CH4 showed a relatively low rate of exchange
compared to a range of higher hydrocarbons, only
C2H6 was lower.
Utiyama et al. [6] studied CH4/D2 exchange over
a limited range of oxides and found that the alkaline
earth oxides and La2O3 were most active. The correla-
tion of activity with basicity indicated that heterolytic
CH bond dissociation was rate determining. This was
also supported by the observation that ethane was less
reactive than methane, and this was attributed to ethane
having a higher pKa and lower CH bond dissocia-
tion energy than methane. Conversely, in their study
of hydrocarbon/D2 exchange over TiO2 (rutile) in a
static batch reactor, Kemball and co-workers [7] have
found that initial rates at 440 C followed the order:
CH4 < C2H6 < C3H8 < i-C4H10 < n-C4H10
Dehydrogenation was observed to occur as a concur-
rent process for the C3 and C4 alkanes. The activity
pattern was very similar to that observed over metal
catalysts involving homolytic fission and related di-
rectly to CH bond dissociation energy rather than
hydrocarbon pKa.
The present paper describes a study of the
methane/deuterium exchange reaction over a wide
range of metal oxides. This was undertaken as part
of an ongoing study aimed at the development of
improved catalysts for the selective partial oxidation
of methane, the overall approach of which has been
described elsewhere [8]. The specific aim of this
study was to probe methane activation efficacy over
metal oxide catalysts, however, the present study also
has wider application to the more general problem of
alkane activation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalytic microreactor
Methane/deuterium exchange experiments were
performed in a laboratory plug flow microreactor.
Gas flow rates were maintained with Brooks 5850
TR mass flow controllers. Helium (BOC, 99.995%)
could be fed directly to the catalyst bed, whilst
hydrogen (BOC, 99.99%) and deuterium (BOC,
99.7%) were fed to a four-port Valco valve, which
could be switched using a two-way actuator driven
by compressed air, allowing pulses of deuterium to
be introduced to the catalyst. The reactor tube was
made from 6 mm o.d. fused silica tubing and was ap-
proximately 70 mm in length. The catalytic bed was
heated using a furnace with a 25 mm uniform heated
length, regulated with a Eurotherm controller with a
thermocouple located within the furnace block. The
reactor lines were built from 316 stainless steel tub-
ing, and it was designed such that any dead volume,
particularly after the catalyst bed, was reduced to
a minimum.
Analysis of the reaction products was performed
on line using a modified Varian Saturn GCMS sys-
tem, configured with two Valco gas sampling valves
and two columns for separation, a Megabore Poraplot
GS-Q and a Megabore GSMolsieve (both 30 m
length and 0.53 mm i.d.), both of which were used for
the methane elution. Helium (BOC, 99.995%) was
used as the carrier gas. The system consisted of two
detectors, a TCD and a quadrupole mass spectrome-
ter in parallel. The column effluent was split in a 9:1
ratio, the majority going to the TCD. The quadrupole
mass spectrometer was supplied by Hiden and oper-
ated over a range of 0200 atomic mass units at unit
mass resolution. Sixteen channels could be simulta-
neously monitored covering partial pressure ranges
from 1 × 104 to 1 × 1010 Torr for any mass in
the scan range. Data acquisition was extremely rapid
and under normal operation all mass channels were
scanned in approximately 0.2 s.
The catalysts were loaded into the reactor tube in
powdered form. The catalyst bed length was typically
J.S.J. Hargreaves et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 227 (2002) 191200
193
25 mm and was held in place between two silica wool
plugs. Mass flow controller settings for CH4 and
H2/D2 were 0.69 and 0.83 ml min1, respectively, giv-
ing a GSHV of 290 h1 and contact time of approx-
imately 12 s. Catalysts were pre-treated in situ with
CH4 and H2 at 540 C for 2 h prior to use. Approxi-
mately, 120 s before the introduction of a D2 pulse,
the D2 flow rate was set to 0.83 ml min1 and allowed
to stabilise. A 200 s pulse of D2 was then introduced
to the catalyst and 185 s after its commencement the
reactor effluent was sampled by the GCMS. Methane
was separated effectively from residual components
in the system and the methane peak was analysed
by monitoring the m/e values of 1520. Masses 15
and 16 were measured on a 105 Torr partial pressure
range, and masses 1720 on a 107 Torr range. This
procedure was repeated until concordant results were
obtained. The influence of temperature on activity
was measured by decreasing the reaction temperature,
allowing the reaction to stabilise for 15 min and then
introducing further pulses of D2.
The methane chromatographic peak shapes were
found to differ between analyses, probably due to
water accumulation on the Molsieve column, and
thus, because it was therefore, unreliable to use
m/e partial pressure ratios from peak heights, areas
were integrated for each peak. The cracking pat-
terns for methane and its deuterated forms have been
well-studied [911]. In the present study, m/e 16
was used to identify CH4 and m/e values of 1720
were used for CH3D, CH2D2, CHD3 and CD4, re-
spectively. The mass spectrometer response factor for
methane was determined by calibration with mixtures
of methane in helium and this value was also applied
to the various deuterated methanes, making the as-
sumption that their response factors were identical,
as demonstrated by Hill et al. [11]. The integrated
peak area for m/e 17 was corrected for contributions
from naturally abundant 13C in CH4. Under condi-
tions where the exchange reaction produced CH2D2,
the m/e 17 peak was also corrected for its contribu-
tion from cracking. In accordance with the literature
[11], the m/e 18/17 ratio from the CH2D2 species was
taken to be 0.55. Interfering contributions to peak
areas introduced via the reactor such as m/e 17 and
18 from atmospheric H2O and m/e 16 from O2 did
not influence the results since they were removed
chromatographically. The mass spectrometer was also
calibrated for higher levels of CH4 in the 4050%
range, so that it could be used to determine the exact
methane feed concentration.
The conversion was calculated using:
 CD
CH4
× 100%
where  CD is the sum of all the deuterated methane
product concentrations and CH4 is the methane con-
centration in the feed.
2.2. Catalytic materials and characterisation
A wide range of metal oxides was used in this study
(Table 1). All the materials used were commercially
supplied oxides, generally of guaranteed purity >99%.
No pre-treatment was performed prior to charging the
materials into the catalytic microreactor.
Surface areas were determined by nitrogen adsorp-
tion at 77 K in accordance with the BET method. Pow-
der X-ray diffraction measurements were performed
using a Hiltonbrooks modified Philips 1050 W diffrac-
tometer with a Cu K radiation source operating at
40 kV and 20 mA. Specimens were prepared by com-
paction into a glass-backed aluminium sample holder.
Data was collected over a 2θ range from 5 to 75
and phases were identified by matching experimental
patterns to entries in the JCPDS powder diffraction
file.
3. Results
3.1. Characterisation
Table 1 shows the phases identified by powder
X-ray diffraction before and after use and the results
of BET surface area determination. It is apparent that
many of the materials have undergone reduction on
reaction, which is not surprising given the reducing
nature of the reaction atmosphere. Some of the more
basic oxides contained hydroxide phases after test-
ing, which probably formed after discharge from the
reactor due to exposure in moist air. In contrast, the
Ga2O3 based catalyst initially contained a GaO(OH)
phase which was not evident after reaction. Several
months after reaction, the GaO(OH) phase was again

apparent in this sample. After use, Co3O4, Fe2O3
and SnO2 contained metallic phases. Co3O4 was
completely reduced, whilst Fe2O3 reduced to a mix-
ture comprising predominantly Fe3O4 with some Fe,
and SnO2 partially reduced to yield a minority Sn
phase. Mn2O3, Tb4O7 and V2O5 reduced to give sin-
gle phases of MnO, Tb2O3 and V2O3, respectively.
MoO3 and WO3, which are known to form shear
structures [12], retained some original structure but
also exhibited additional broad X-ray reflections were
evident in the post-reactor material. The identification
of these phases proved difficult and only W25O73
could be unequivocally assigned in the case of WO3.
It is therefore, most probable that many of the new
reflections evident in the analyses of the used WO3
and MoO3 are due to similar oxygen-deficient phases.

3.2. Catalytic performance
Experiments performed in the empty reactor tube
and in the presence of silica wool demonstrated that
there was no contribution of background effects to ac-
tivity. The oxides Nb2O5, MoO3, SiO2, SnO2, Tb4O7,
WO3 and Y2O3 did not demonstrate any detectable
exchange activity, even after 5 h on line at 540 C.
The remaining oxides, which did not reduce fully,
demonstrated activity patterns which are described
here. Initially, activity was observed to increase with
time on line until after ca. 1.52 h, depending on the
oxide, steady state activity was attained. The majority
of the remaining materials, i.e. Al2O3, CaO, Gd2O3,
La2O3, MgO, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, Sm2O3, V2O5, Yb2O3
and ZrO2, were moderately active at temperatures of
ca. 420 C and above. In accordance with its surface
area, the total conversion over Al2O3 was greatest in
this grouping of oxides. In all these cases, CH3D was
the predominant reaction product, CH2D2 was only
observed when the conversion was above 6%, and was
generally in the region of 515% of the conversion
to CH3D. It is noteworthy that the selectivity towards
CH2D2 was higher in the case of MgO, accounting
for approximately 27% of the conversion to CH3D.
It appears that the production of CH3D and CH2D2
are related for the above grouping, since they vary
in a similar manner with temperature. The activities
of the Fe2O3-, Mn2O3- and TiO2-based materials
were determined under similar conditions and were
observed to be considerably lower. None of these ox-
ides showed any selectivity towards CH2D2, although
it should be noted that at these levels of conversion
CH2D2 may be below the limit of detection.
The conversion shown by Cr2O3, Ga2O3 and ZnO
were considerable higher than the other oxides investi-
gated over the same temperature range (420540 C).
The maximum dynamic range of the mass spectrom-
eter was exceeded, and for experimental reasons and
to minimise any potential diffusion limitations the
three catalysts were investigated at lower tempera-
tures. Catalytic activities were investigated over the
ranges 370450 C for Cr2O3, 290300 C for Ga2O3
and 350400 C for ZnO. As observed previously with
the majority of oxides, exchange products were dom-
inated by CH3D, with minor quantities of CH2D2
formed with selectivity patterns similar to that de-
scribed above.
Co3O4- and Ta2O5-based materials showed differ-
ent activity patterns from all the other materials. The
conversions over these materials were so low that peak
areas could not be reliably determined. The conver-
sions demonstrated by these materials at the maximum
temperature of this investigation (540 C) were below
0.2%. However, qualitatively it is interesting to note
that under our reaction conditions, all possible deuter-
ated products were observed and relative selectivities
were:
CH3D > CH2D2 > CHD3 > CD4
To facilitate comparison between all the oxides stud-
ied, the Arrhenius plots for low conversion data (typi-
cally <8%) are shown in Fig. 1. Linear regression was
performed to fit a straight line function to the datasets;
a correlation coefficient of 0.985 was exceeded in all
cases. Table 2 lists the activation energies and inter-
cept values determined from the gradients. The Arrhe-
nius plots were then used to calculate the exchange
rates at 500 C, giving the data which is presented in
Table 3 along with total surface areas of the materi-
als in the reactor. Correcting the exchange rates for
the effect of surface area gives rise to a ranking order
to compare the ability of each metal oxide to activate
methane (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion
In view of the potential dehydrogenation activity of
Ga2O3 and ZnO species in the Cyclar process [1315],
it is noteworthy that these two materials were found
to be the most active for the exchange reaction. The
explanation for their efficacy is at present unclear, and
may relate to redox behaviour, hydroxyl chemistry,
alkyl formation or catalyst structure. It is not clear
whether methane activation, hydrogen (deuterium) ac-
tivation or the corresponding desorption processes are
rate limiting in this study. Although further studies
are necessary to answer the above questions, it is in-
formative to make comparisons with related litera-
ture. Rooney and co-workers [16] have reported the
use of gallium oxide for the exchange of deuterium
with the allylic hydrogen atoms of alkenes. They note
that activity is dependent upon the loss of optimum
amounts of oxygen from the catalyst surface which
is achieved by outgassing at 290 C for 10 min. On
this basis, we would expect gallium oxide to be in
a partially reduced state during catalyst testing. We
expect zinc oxide to be similarly partially reduced,
since the loss of oxygen from this material on heat-
ing is well known [12]. Chromium oxide, which has
frequently been identified in the literature as an active
dehydrogenation catalyst, and is used for dehydro-
genation industrially [17], was the third most active
material. By virtue of its weak n-type semiconductiv-
ity [18], it would be expected that Cr2O3 would also
be partially reduced during testing. Although on the
basis of these arguments it is tempting to relate ac-
tivity pattern to reduction, however, consideration of
the dataset as a whole indicates that this explanation
is too simplistic. For example, Fe3O4, which consists
of iron in both oxidation state 2+ and 3+, was com-
paratively low in activity for exchange.
The non-stoichiometry of zinc oxide and gallium
oxide has previously been related to weak adsorption
of hydrogen [18], which suggests the possibility that
these materials facilitate hydrogen desorption which
could be rate limiting. In agreement with this sugges-
tion, altervalent doping of ZnO catalysts has been ob-
served to influence the rate of H2/D2 exchange [19].
The introduction of a donor dopant (Al3+ or Ga3+)
was reported to enhance activity whilst an acceptor
(Li+) had a retarding effect. Conversely, such doping
did not alter the hydrogen chemisorption rates, or in
a separate study, the activation energy [20]. Again, it
would be difficult to apply this explanation to the en-
tire dataset, as chromia, e.g. has been reported to ad-
sorb hydrogen strongly [18]. This suggests that if a
general rationalisation to our dataset as a whole is ap-
plicable, then activity must be related to the methane
activation or desorption processes, and this could be
easily probed by studying the rates of CH4/CD4 equi-
libration.
Utiyama et al. [6] have emphasised the importance
of catalyst basicity in the exchange process, ascribing
its importance for methane activation by heterolytic
dissociation, i.e.
CH4 CH3+ H+
Although we have not experimentally determined
the acidbase properties of the materials used in the
present study, we can find indirect support for the role
of basicity by considering the rare-earth sesquioxides
and the two alkaline earth oxides tested. In general,
activity was observed to increase with increasing
cationic radius for these two sets of oxides. Fig. 3
presents a plot of the normalised activity against the
cationic radius [21], for the rare-earth oxides. It is
apparent that the activity does not vary in a linear
manner with the radius and that Sm2O3 is not as

active as would be expected on this basis. A possible
reason for the low activity is evidenced in our XRD
studies. On comparing the widths of reflections of
the pre- and post-reactor samples, it was apparent
that the used sample showed significantly narrower
diffraction peaks when compared to the unused sam-
ple indicating crystallite size increased on reaction,
which suggests that the pre-reactor surface area used
in the activity normalisation could have been an
over-estimate, leading to an anomalously low nor-
malised activity. In the context of the influence of
basicity, an additional observation is that those mate-
rials with metals in oxidation states of four and higher,
and which hence may be expected to display higher
Lewis acid strengths [22], are amongst the least active
in this study. However, any attempt to rank the oxides
in terms of acidbase properties can be misleading,
since the above types of basicity argument do not
hold for our dataset as a whole, e.g. Ga2O3 is not
expected to be the most basic material. In view of the
basicity arguments, it is surprising that Y2O3 which
is known to be basic, was inactive for the exchange
reaction. It is possible that inactive surface phases had
formed which were not removed by the pre-treatment
procedure.
It is very interesting to note the similarity of the
activity patterns for the first row transition metal ox-
ides in this study with those reported for hydrogena-
tion [23] and hydrogendeuterium exchange reactions
[18]. Fig. 4 is a comparison of our data and data for
the activity for ethene hydrogenation. In both ethylene
hydrogenation and methane exchange, there are max-
ima for Cr2O3 and ZnO, although the relative mag-
nitudes of these are interchanged. The maximum for
Co3O4 is not apparent for methane exchange, due to
reduction to cobalt metal, whilst NiO was not tested.
This similarity in behaviour cannot be taken to indi-
cate that hydrogen activation, the simplest common
step, is rate determining for these materials since this
pattern extends to reactions such as disproportiona-
tion of cyclohexene. The pattern has previously been
interpreted in relation to outer electronic configura-
tion and crystal field effects of the metal cation. It
has been argued that an incomplete d electron shell
with an optimum number of unpaired electrons is re-
quired for high activity. Although it is notable that

the ions of the most active oxides tested in our study,
i.e. Ga3+ and Zn2+, are isoelectronic, they are both
3d10 systems. Gallium oxide and zinc oxide were in-
cluded in the hydrogen/deuterium exchange study and
were found to be comparatively inactive [18]. Extrap-
olation of the rates in Table 3, using the Arrhenius
parameters in Table 2, to the temperature used for
the hydrogendeuterium exchange study demonstrates
that the difference in relative activities between the two
studies is not a function of the different temperatures
employed. We currently cannot identify the origin of
this difference, but it is possible that there is a differ-
ent rate determining steps operating in the reactions.
As noted above, and in contrast to Cr2O3, Ga2O3 was
reported to activate hydrogen but only weakly. How-
ever, the high propensity of partially reduced gallium
oxide to form alkyls cannot be used to explain our
results since gallium alkyl formation by direct routes
from the metal is known to be difficult [24]. Another
consideration to be made is that the form of gallium
oxide in the present study and the hydrogen/deuterium
study may be different since there is little character-
isation data in the previous study. Recent work has
shown that there can be large differences in turnover
frequency for  and  forms of Ga2O3, when applied
to the selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxide with
methane [25].
To summarise the above, it is not possible to re-
late the overall activity pattern obtained in this study
to catalyst basicity, although a correlation is observed
for the rare earth and alkaline earth oxides. An activity
pattern for the first row transition metal oxides similar
to those previously published for hydrogendeuterium
exchange and hydrogenation, and suggests a similar-
ity in mechanism may exist. This relationship between
comparative activities does not extend to all the com-
mon materials tested, however. Taken together, these
observations suggest that different rate determining
steps may be occurring for the different groupings of
oxides. However, from the similar activity patterns be-
tween singly and doubly deuterated methane forma-
tion for many of the materials, it does appear that in
the most cases a sequential pathway is in operation.
Exceptions to this are the Co3O4- and Ta2O5-based
materials. As is evident from Table 1, it is clear that
Co3O4 has been completely reduced to metallic cobalt
on reaction; the simultaneous observation of all deuter-
ated products is consistent with previous studies of
this reaction over metals, where the intermediacy of
hydrogen deficient surface species has been proposed
200

[1]. The behaviour over the Ta2O5 material is more
difficult to explain; it may be that there is an intrinsic
difference in the behaviour of this oxide compared to
the others, or that a limited degree of reduction has
occurred, producing an XRD invisible active metal-
lic phase. Also, the significantly higher selectivity to
CH2D2 for MgO is interesting and may indicate that
this material may effects exchange to a doubly ex-
changed species via a sequential route and a second
route resulting directly in CH2D2. A further possibility
to explain the activity pattern is that coke is formed on
the catalyst and facilitates hydrogen transfer However,
if this was simply the case it would be anticipated that
the more acidic catalysts would display higher activity.
5. Conclusion
A
range
of
metal
oxides
have
been
evalu-
ated for their ability to activate methane using
methane/deuterium exchange as a probe reaction.
Ga2O3, which has not, to the best of our knowledge,
been previously reported by others in the literature for
this reaction, was the most active material, followed by
ZnO. These observations are interesting in view of the
dehydrogenation role of these two materials in alkane
aromatisation reactions. The previously reported ba-
sicity trends were observed for limited groups of these
oxides, although when taking the dataset as a whole,
no direct relationship between predicted basicity
and performance could be discerned. Thus, equating
methane activation ability to expected acid-base prop-
erties of all the metal oxides can lead to erroneous con-
clusions. An activity pattern similar to those observed
for hydrogenation and H2/D2 exchange reactions in
other studies was apparent for the first row transition
metal oxides, and this may indicate a similarity of
mechanism for this sub-set of materials. It is proposed
that the origin of the exceptional activity of Ga2O3
and ZnO may relate to partial reduction during testing.
