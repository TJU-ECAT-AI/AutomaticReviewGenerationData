Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be an errata notice for a conference proceedings, and does not discuss catalysis mechanisms or alkane transformations. Without additional relevant information, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive analysis of the alkane metathesis process as requested in the question.

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be about errata for conference proceedings and does not discuss alkane metathesis or tantalum catalysts. Without relevant information in the provided text, I cannot properly answer the question about the comprehensive mechanism, two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in alkane transformations, formation of intermediates, or factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.
