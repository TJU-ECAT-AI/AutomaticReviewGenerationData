[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."

[2] "While we earlier proposed mechanism based on cleaving the CC bond system by either σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition,13 we now propose that it proceeds via carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis as suggested by previous studies.18,19"

[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

[4] "To observe a productive cross-metathesis of methane with an alkane, the reaction with propane was investigated in a continuous-flow reactor, and the reaction conditions tuned to work at full conversion of propane."

[5] "1.9 moles of ethane are produced per mole of propane consumed and 95% of the propane is converted by cross-metathesis, that is through its reaction with methane to produce two ethane molecules."

The alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes and intermediates:

1. Activation: The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through CH bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species.

2. Carbene formation: The mechanism now proposed involves carbene intermediates, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

3. Olefin metathesis: The reaction proceeds through olefin metathesis, implying the formation of alkene intermediates.

4. One-site and two-site mechanisms: Both are proposed, depending on whether the active site is generated from TaIII or TaV intermediates.

5. Metallacyclobutane intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, these are likely involved in the olefin metathesis step.

6. Linear alkane transformations: The catalyst can convert propane to ethane through cross-metathesis with methane, demonstrating its ability to handle linear alkanes.

7. Cyclic alkane transformations: Not specifically addressed in the given text.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios affect the equilibrium and kinetics.

2. Catalyst design: The highly electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride supported on silica contributes to its activity.

3. Continuous-flow setup: This allows for tuning conditions to achieve full conversion of the higher alkane (e.g., propane).

The catalyst shows high selectivity for cross-metathesis (95% for propane conversion) and can incorporate methane into higher alkanes, demonstrating its potential for various alkane conversions and valorization of methane.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程和中间体：

1. 活化：催化剂[(SiO)2Ta-H]通过CH键断裂活化烷烃，形成表面烷基物种。

2. 卡宾形成：目前提出的机理涉及卡宾中间体，而不是先前建议的σ键复分解或氧化加成。

3. 烯烃复分解：反应通过烯烃复分解进行，这意味着形成烯烃中间体。

4. 单位点和双位点机制：两种机制都被提出，取决于活性位是从TaIII还是TaV中间体产生。

5. 金属杂环丁烷中间体：虽然没有明确提到，但这些可能涉及烯烃复分解步骤。

6. 线性烷烃转化：催化剂可以通过与甲烷的交叉复分解将丙烷转化为乙烷，证明了其处理线性烷烃的能力。

7. 环状烷烃转化：在给定的文本中没有具体提及。

反应选择性和催化剂性能受以下因素影响：

1. 反应条件：温度、压力和反应物比例影响平衡和动力学。

2. 催化剂设计：二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物的高度亲电性有助于其活性。

3. 连续流动设置：这允许调整条件以实现较高烷烃（如丙烷）的完全转化。

催化剂对交叉复分解表现出高选择性（丙烷转化率95%），并且可以将甲烷并入较高烷烃中，展示了其在各种烷烃转化和甲烷增值方面的潜力。
