          [1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."

[2] "While we earlier proposed mechanism based on cleaving the CC bond system by either σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition,13 we now propose that it proceeds via carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis as suggested by previous studies.18,19"

[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

Possible mechanisms via carbene intermediates: a) on two sites and b) on one site."

[5] "To observe a productive cross-metathesis of methane with an alkane, the reaction with propane was investigated in a continuous-flow reactor, and the reaction conditions tuned to work at full conversion of propane."

[6] "1.9 moles of ethane are produced per mole of propane consumed and 95% of the propane is converted by cross-metathesis, that is through its reaction with methane to produce two ethane molecules."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through C-H bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species. The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

Two possible mechanisms are proposed:
1. Two-site mechanism: This involves cooperation between two tantalum sites, with one site forming the carbene and the other activating the alkane.
2. One-site mechanism: A single tantalum site performs both the carbene formation and alkane activation steps.

The process for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations includes:
1. Initial activation of alkanes
2. Carbene formation
3. Olefin formation (likely through β-hydride elimination)
4. Olefin metathesis
5. Chain propagation

Key intermediates in this process include:
- Surface alkyl species
- Carbenes
- Olefins
- Metallacyclobutanes (likely involved in the olefin metathesis step)

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on factors such as:
- Relative stability of different carbene intermediates
- Rates of olefin formation and consumption
- Ability of the catalyst to coordinate and activate different alkanes
- Reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure)
- Catalyst design (e.g., the electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride)

The catalyst shows high selectivity for cross-metathesis, as demonstrated in the propane conversion experiment where 95% of propane is converted through cross-metathesis with methane to produce ethane. This ability to incorporate methane into higher alkanes demonstrates the catalyst's potential for various alkane conversions and valorization of methane.

However, the exact details of how these factors contribute to selectivity and performance are still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand the intricacies of the catalyst's behavior in different alkane conversion scenarios.

          由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理涉及双位点和单位点方案。催化剂[(SiO)2Ta-H]通过C-H键断裂活化烷烃，形成表面烷基物种。目前提出的机理涉及卡宾中间体和烯烃复分解，而不是先前建议的σ键复分解或氧化加成。

提出了两种可能的机理：
1. 双位点机理：这涉及两个钽位点之间的协作，一个位点形成卡宾，另一个位点活化烷烃。
2. 单位点机理：单个钽位点同时执行卡宾形成和烷烃活化步骤。

线性和环状烷烃转化的过程包括：
1. 烷烃的初始活化
2. 卡宾形成
3. 烯烃形成（可能通过β-氢消除）
4. 烯烃复分解
5. 链传播

此过程中的关键中间体包括：
- 表面烷基物种
- 卡宾
- 烯烃
- 金属环丁烷（可能涉及烯烃复分解步骤）

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能取决于以下因素：
- 不同卡宾中间体的相对稳定性
- 烯烃形成和消耗的速率
- 催化剂配位和活化不同烷烃的能力
- 反应条件（如温度、压力）
- 催化剂设计（如钽氢化物的亲电性）

催化剂对交叉复分解表现出高选择性，如丙烷转化实验所示，其中95%的丙烷通过与甲烷的交叉复分解转化为乙烷。这种将甲烷并入高级烷烃的能力展示了催化剂在各种烷烃转化和甲烷增值方面的潜力。

然而，这些因素如何影响选择性和性能的确切细节仍在研究中，需要进一步研究以充分理解催化剂在不同烷烃转化情况下行为的复杂性。
