The alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that can proceed through both two-site and one-site pathways. The reaction transforms alkanes into their higher and lower homologues through a series of carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation steps.

The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition pathways. This mechanism can occur via either TaIII or TaV intermediates.

In the two-site mechanism, two tantalum centers work cooperatively. One site activates the alkane to form a metal-alkyl species, while the other site forms a metal carbene. These intermediates then interact to form a metallacyclobutane, which subsequently breaks down to form new alkanes and regenerate the active sites.

The one-site mechanism involves a single tantalum center that goes through multiple transformations. It first activates the alkane to form a metal-alkyl species, then undergoes α-hydrogen abstraction to form an alkene and a metal-hydride. The alkene then reacts with the metal center to form a carbene, which can undergo olefin metathesis with another alkene to form new carbon-carbon bonds.

Both linear and cyclic alkanes can undergo this metathesis process. For linear alkanes, the reaction can lead to both chain shortening and lengthening. Cyclic alkanes can be opened and recombined to form different ring sizes or linear products.

Key intermediates in this process include metal-alkyl species, metal-carbenes, alkenes, and metallacyclobutanes. The formation and stability of these intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and overall catalyst performance.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by factors such as the nature of the alkane substrate, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and the specific properties of the catalyst. The silica support and the electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride are crucial for the catalyst's performance, allowing for efficient alkane activation and transformation.

This mechanism allows for various alkane conversions, including the cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes, which provides a route for the direct transformation of methane into more valuable hydrocarbon materials. The versatility of this catalytic system opens up possibilities for new processes in hydrocarbon chemistry and petrochemical industry applications.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解涉及一个复杂的机制，可以通过双位点和单位点途径进行。该反应通过一系列碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤将烷烃转化为其更高和更低的同系物。

目前提出的机制涉及卡宾中间体和烯烃复分解，而不是先前建议的σ-键复分解或氧化加成途径。这种机制可以通过TaIII或TaV中间体进行。

在双位点机制中，两个钽中心协同工作。一个位点激活烷烃形成金属-烷基物种，而另一个位点形成金属卡宾。这些中间体然后相互作用形成金属环丁烷，随后分解形成新的烷烃并再生活性位点。

单位点机制涉及单个钽中心经历多重转化。它首先激活烷烃形成金属-烷基物种，然后经历α-氢抽提形成烯烃和金属-氢化物。烯烃随后与金属中心反应形成卡宾，卡宾可以与另一个烯烃进行烯烃复分解形成新的碳-碳键。

直链和环状烷烃都可以经历这种复分解过程。对于直链烷烃，反应可以导致链的缩短和延长。环状烷烃可以被打开并重组形成不同的环大小或直链产物。

这个过程中的关键中间体包括金属-烷基物种、金属-卡宾、烯烃和金属环丁烷。这些中间体的形成和稳定性在决定反应选择性和整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。

反应的选择性受到诸如烷烃底物的性质、反应条件（温度、压力）以及催化剂的特定性质等因素的影响。二氧化硅支持和钽氢化物的亲电性对催化剂的性能至关重要，允许高效的烷烃活化和转化。

这种机制允许各种烷烃转化，包括甲烷与高级烷烃的交叉复分解，为甲烷直接转化为更有价值的碳氢化合物材料提供了途径。这个催化系统的多功能性为碳氢化合物化学和石油化工行业应用中的新工艺打开了可能性。
