[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."

[2] "While we earlier proposed mechanism based on cleaving the CC bond system by either σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition,13 we now propose that it proceeds via carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis as suggested by previous studies.18,19"

[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

[4] "To observe a productive cross-metathesis of methane with an alkane, the reaction with propane was investigated in a continuous-flow reactor, and the reaction conditions tuned to work at full conversion of propane."

[5] "1.9 moles of ethane are produced per mole of propane consumed and 95% of the propane is converted by cross-metathesis, that is through its reaction with methane to produce two ethane molecules."

The alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes and intermediates:

1. Activation: The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through CH bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species.

2. Carbene formation: The mechanism now proposed involves carbene intermediates, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

3. Olefin metathesis: The reaction proceeds through olefin metathesis, implying the formation of alkene intermediates.

4. One-site and two-site mechanisms: Both are proposed, depending on whether the active site is generated from TaIII or TaV intermediates.

5. Metallacyclobutane intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, these are likely involved in the olefin metathesis step.

6. Linear alkane transformations: The catalyst can convert propane to ethane through cross-metathesis with methane, demonstrating its ability to handle linear alkanes.

7. Cyclic alkane transformations: Not specifically addressed in the given text.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios affect the equilibrium and kinetics.

2. Catalyst design: The highly electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride supported on silica contributes to its activity.

3. Continuous-flow setup: This allows for tuning conditions to achieve full conversion of the higher alkane (e.g., propane).

The catalyst shows high selectivity for cross-metathesis (95% for propane conversion) and can incorporate methane into higher alkanes, demonstrating its potential for various alkane conversions and valorization of methane.

The alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that can proceed through both two-site and one-site pathways. The reaction transforms alkanes into their higher and lower homologues through a series of carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation steps.

The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition pathways. This mechanism can occur via either TaIII or TaV intermediates.

In the two-site mechanism, two tantalum centers work cooperatively. One site activates the alkane to form a metal-alkyl species, while the other site forms a metal carbene. These intermediates then interact to form a metallacyclobutane, which subsequently breaks down to form new alkanes and regenerate the active sites.

The one-site mechanism involves a single tantalum center that goes through multiple transformations. It first activates the alkane to form a metal-alkyl species, then undergoes α-hydrogen abstraction to form an alkene and a metal-hydride. The alkene then reacts with the metal center to form a carbene, which can undergo olefin metathesis with another alkene to form new carbon-carbon bonds.

Both linear and cyclic alkanes can undergo this metathesis process. For linear alkanes, the reaction can lead to both chain shortening and lengthening. Cyclic alkanes can be opened and recombined to form different ring sizes or linear products.

Key intermediates in this process include metal-alkyl species, metal-carbenes, alkenes, and metallacyclobutanes. The formation and stability of these intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and overall catalyst performance.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by factors such as the nature of the alkane substrate, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and the specific properties of the catalyst. The silica support and the electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride are crucial for the catalyst's performance, allowing for efficient alkane activation and transformation.

This mechanism allows for various alkane conversions, including the cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes, which provides a route for the direct transformation of methane into more valuable hydrocarbon materials. The versatility of this catalytic system opens up possibilities for new processes in hydrocarbon chemistry and petrochemical industry applications.

The alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both one-site and two-site schemes. The process begins with the activation of the catalyst, forming surface alkyl species through CH bond activation. The reaction proceeds through carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously proposed σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition mechanisms.

In the two-site mechanism, two tantalum centers are involved. One site activates an alkane to form a metal-alkyl species, while the other site forms a metal-carbene. These intermediates then interact to form a metallacyclobutane, which subsequently breaks down to form new alkanes and regenerate the active sites.

The one-site mechanism involves a single tantalum center that alternates between metal-alkyl and metal-carbene species. This site activates an alkane, forms a carbene, and then reacts with another alkane to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The metallacyclobutane then decomposes to yield new alkanes and regenerate the active site.

Key intermediates in both mechanisms include metal-alkyls, metal-carbenes, alkenes (formed transiently), and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of alkenes is crucial for the olefin metathesis step, which is central to the overall alkane metathesis process.

These mechanisms apply to both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. For linear alkanes, the process can lead to chain lengthening or shortening, while for cyclic alkanes, it can result in ring expansion or contraction.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on factors such as the relative stability of different carbene intermediates, the rate of alkane activation, and the thermodynamics of the overall process. The ability of the catalyst to form and stabilize carbene intermediates is crucial for its efficiency in alkane metathesis reactions.

The proposed mechanisms explain the observed incorporation of methane into higher alkanes, as well as the formation of both higher and lower homologues from a given alkane. However, further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the details of these mechanisms and their relative contributions to the overall catalytic process.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Initial activation: The tantalum hydride catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through C-H bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species.

2. Carbene formation: The current proposed mechanism suggests the formation of carbene intermediates, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

3. Olefin formation: The mechanism requires the formation of olefins as intermediates, likely through β-hydride elimination from the surface alkyl species.

4. Olefin metathesis: The carbene intermediates engage in olefin metathesis with the formed olefins, leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation.

5. Chain propagation: The process continues with further C-H activations and metathesis steps, resulting in the transformation of alkanes into their higher and lower homologues.

Two possible mechanisms are proposed:

1. Two-site mechanism: This involves cooperation between two tantalum sites, with one site forming the carbene and the other activating the alkane.

2. One-site mechanism: A single tantalum site performs both the carbene formation and alkane activation steps.

The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates include surface alkyl species, carbenes, and olefins. The formation of these intermediates and their subsequent reactions contribute to the selectivity of the process.

The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions depends on its ability to activate C-H bonds, form stable carbene intermediates, and facilitate olefin metathesis. The electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride catalyst plays a crucial role in its activity and selectivity.

The proposed mechanisms are still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully elucidate the details of the catalytic cycle and the factors influencing selectivity and performance in different alkane conversions.

The alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] can convert alkanes into their higher and lower homologues.

The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the earlier proposed σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition. This suggests the formation of olefins as key intermediates in the process.

Both one-site and two-site mechanisms are proposed, depending on whether the active site is generated from TaIII or TaV intermediates. In the two-site mechanism, two tantalum centers likely work cooperatively to facilitate the transformation. The one-site mechanism would involve a single tantalum center cycling through different oxidation states and coordinating multiple species.

While not explicitly detailed in the text, the formation of metallacyclobutanes is likely involved as a key step in the olefin metathesis portion of the mechanism, based on established olefin metathesis pathways.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions would be influenced by factors such as the relative stability of different carbene intermediates, the rates of olefin formation and consumption, and the ability of the catalyst to coordinate and activate different alkanes. The balance between these factors would determine the distribution of products and the overall efficiency of the metathesis process.

However, the exact details of how these factors contribute to selectivity and performance are not fully elucidated in the given text, as the mechanisms are still under investigation. Further research would be needed to fully understand the intricacies of the catalyst's behavior in different alkane conversion scenarios.
