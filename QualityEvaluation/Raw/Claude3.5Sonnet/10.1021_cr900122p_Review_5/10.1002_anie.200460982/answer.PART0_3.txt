[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."

[2] "While we earlier proposed mechanism based on cleaving the CC bond system by either σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition,13 we now propose that it proceeds via carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis as suggested by previous studies.18,19"

[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Initial activation: The tantalum hydride catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through C-H bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species.

2. Carbene formation: The current proposed mechanism suggests the formation of carbene intermediates, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

3. Olefin formation: The mechanism requires the formation of olefins as intermediates, likely through β-hydride elimination from the surface alkyl species.

4. Olefin metathesis: The carbene intermediates engage in olefin metathesis with the formed olefins, leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation.

5. Chain propagation: The process continues with further C-H activations and metathesis steps, resulting in the transformation of alkanes into their higher and lower homologues.

Two possible mechanisms are proposed:

1. Two-site mechanism: This involves cooperation between two tantalum sites, with one site forming the carbene and the other activating the alkane.

2. One-site mechanism: A single tantalum site performs both the carbene formation and alkane activation steps.

The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. Key intermediates include surface alkyl species, carbenes, and olefins. The formation of these intermediates and their subsequent reactions contribute to the selectivity of the process.

The catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions depends on its ability to activate C-H bonds, form stable carbene intermediates, and facilitate olefin metathesis. The electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride catalyst plays a crucial role in its activity and selectivity.

The proposed mechanisms are still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully elucidate the details of the catalytic cycle and the factors influencing selectivity and performance in different alkane conversions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 初始活化：钽氢化物催化剂[(SiO)2Ta-H]通过C-H键断裂活化烷烃，形成表面烷基物种。

2. 卡宾形成：当前提出的机理表明形成卡宾中间体，而不是先前建议的σ键复分解或氧化加成。

3. 烯烃形成：该机理需要形成烯烃作为中间体，可能是通过表面烷基物种的β-氢消除实现的。

4. 烯烃复分解：卡宾中间体与形成的烯烃进行烯烃复分解，导致碳-碳键的断裂和形成。

5. 链传播：该过程继续进行进一步的C-H活化和复分解步骤，导致烷烃转化为其更高和更低的同系物。

提出了两种可能的机理：

1. 双位点机理：这涉及两个钽位点之间的协作，一个位点形成卡宾，另一个位点活化烷烃。

2. 单位点机理：单个钽位点同时执行卡宾形成和烷烃活化步骤。

该机理允许线性和环状烷烃的转化。关键中间体包括表面烷基物种、卡宾和烯烃。这些中间体的形成及其后续反应有助于过程的选择性。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能取决于其活化C-H键、形成稳定卡宾中间体和促进烯烃复分解的能力。钽氢化物催化剂的亲电性在其活性和选择性中起着关键作用。

提出的机理仍在研究中，需要进一步研究以充分阐明催化循环的细节以及影响不同烷烃转化中选择性和性能的因素。
