[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."

[2] "While we earlier proposed mechanism based on cleaving the CC bond system by either σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition,13 we now propose that it proceeds via carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis as suggested by previous studies.18,19"

[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

The alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both one-site and two-site schemes. The process begins with the activation of the catalyst, forming surface alkyl species through CH bond activation. The reaction proceeds through carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously proposed σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition mechanisms.

In the two-site mechanism, two tantalum centers are involved. One site activates an alkane to form a metal-alkyl species, while the other site forms a metal-carbene. These intermediates then interact to form a metallacyclobutane, which subsequently breaks down to form new alkanes and regenerate the active sites.

The one-site mechanism involves a single tantalum center that alternates between metal-alkyl and metal-carbene species. This site activates an alkane, forms a carbene, and then reacts with another alkane to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate. The metallacyclobutane then decomposes to yield new alkanes and regenerate the active site.

Key intermediates in both mechanisms include metal-alkyls, metal-carbenes, alkenes (formed transiently), and metallacyclobutanes. The formation of alkenes is crucial for the olefin metathesis step, which is central to the overall alkane metathesis process.

These mechanisms apply to both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. For linear alkanes, the process can lead to chain lengthening or shortening, while for cyclic alkanes, it can result in ring expansion or contraction.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on factors such as the relative stability of different carbene intermediates, the rate of alkane activation, and the thermodynamics of the overall process. The ability of the catalyst to form and stabilize carbene intermediates is crucial for its efficiency in alkane metathesis reactions.

The proposed mechanisms explain the observed incorporation of methane into higher alkanes, as well as the formation of both higher and lower homologues from a given alkane. However, further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the details of these mechanisms and their relative contributions to the overall catalytic process.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及单位点和双位点方案。该过程始于催化剂的活化，通过CH键活化形成表面烷基物种。反应通过卡宾中间体和烯烃复分解进行，而不是先前提出的σ键复分解或氧化加成机理。

在双位点机理中，涉及两个钽中心。一个位点活化烷烃形成金属-烷基物种，而另一个位点形成金属-卡宾。这些中间体然后相互作用形成金属环丁烷，随后分解形成新的烷烃并再生活性位点。

单位点机理涉及单个钽中心，在金属-烷基和金属-卡宾物种之间交替。该位点活化烷烃，形成卡宾，然后与另一个烷烃反应形成金属环丁烷中间体。金属环丁烷随后分解，产生新的烷烃并再生活性位点。

两种机理中的关键中间体包括金属-烷基、金属-卡宾、烯烃（暂时形成）和金属环丁烷。烯烃的形成对于烯烃复分解步骤至关重要，这是整个烷烃复分解过程的核心。

这些机理适用于直链和环烷烃的转化。对于直链烷烃，该过程可导致链的延长或缩短，而对于环烷烃，可导致环的扩大或收缩。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能取决于不同卡宾中间体的相对稳定性、烷烃活化速率以及整个过程的热力学等因素。催化剂形成和稳定卡宾中间体的能力对其在烷烃复分解反应中的效率至关重要。

提出的机理解释了观察到的甲烷掺入高级烷烃的现象，以及从给定烷烃形成高级和低级同系物的现象。然而，需要进一步研究以充分阐明这些机理的细节及其对整个催化过程的相对贡献。
