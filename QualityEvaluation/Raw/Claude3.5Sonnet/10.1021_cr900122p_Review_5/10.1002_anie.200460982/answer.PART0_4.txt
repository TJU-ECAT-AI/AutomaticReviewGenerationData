The alkane metathesis mechanism catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] can convert alkanes into their higher and lower homologues.

The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the earlier proposed σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition. This suggests the formation of olefins as key intermediates in the process.

Both one-site and two-site mechanisms are proposed, depending on whether the active site is generated from TaIII or TaV intermediates. In the two-site mechanism, two tantalum centers likely work cooperatively to facilitate the transformation. The one-site mechanism would involve a single tantalum center cycling through different oxidation states and coordinating multiple species.

While not explicitly detailed in the text, the formation of metallacyclobutanes is likely involved as a key step in the olefin metathesis portion of the mechanism, based on established olefin metathesis pathways.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions would be influenced by factors such as the relative stability of different carbene intermediates, the rates of olefin formation and consumption, and the ability of the catalyst to coordinate and activate different alkanes. The balance between these factors would determine the distribution of products and the overall efficiency of the metathesis process.

However, the exact details of how these factors contribute to selectivity and performance are not fully elucidated in the given text, as the mechanisms are still under investigation. Further research would be needed to fully understand the intricacies of the catalyst's behavior in different alkane conversion scenarios.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的复杂过程。催化剂[(SiO)2Ta-H]可以将烷烃转化为其高级和低级同系物。

目前提出的机理涉及卡宾中间体和烯烃复分解，而不是早期提出的σ键复分解或氧化加成。这表明烯烃的形成是该过程中的关键中间体。

根据活性位是由TaIII还是TaV中间体产生，提出了单位点和双位点机理。在双位点机理中，两个钽中心可能协同工作以促进转化。单位点机理将涉及单个钽中心在不同氧化态之间循环并配位多个物种。

虽然文本中没有明确详述，但基于已建立的烯烃复分解途径，金属环丁烷的形成可能作为烯烃复分解部分的关键步骤参与其中。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能将受到诸如不同卡宾中间体的相对稳定性、烯烃形成和消耗的速率以及催化剂配位和活化不同烷烃的能力等因素的影响。这些因素之间的平衡将决定产物的分布和复分解过程的整体效率。

然而，由于这些机理仍在研究中，给定文本中并未完全阐明这些因素如何影响选择性和性能的确切细节。需要进一步研究以充分理解催化剂在不同烷烃转化情况下行为的复杂性。
