[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[6] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism:
1. CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl species
2. One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides
3. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer
4. Alkene undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes
5. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps release lower and higher alkane homologues

One-site mechanism:
1. Tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates form from tantalum hydrides
2. Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere
3. Cross-metathesis products result from alkane reaction with neopentyl neopentylidene surface complexes

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. The key processes involve CH bond activation, alkene formation, and CC bond cleavage/formation through metallacyclobutane intermediates.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n±1 homologues due to 1-alkene participation in metathesis. Cyclic alkanes undergo similar processes but with lower rates, forming lower cyclic homologues through γ-H activation and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of these catalysts depend on:
1. Support material (silica, alumina, etc.)
2. Metal used (Ta, W, Mo, etc.)
3. Ligand environment (hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes)
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)

These factors influence the stability of key intermediates, rates of elementary steps, and overall catalytic activity. The ability to form and maintain active alkylidene species is crucial for sustained catalytic performance in various alkane conversions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种位点和单位点方案：

双位点机制：
1. CH键活化形成H2和Ta-烷基物种
2. 一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，同时再生钽氢化物
3. 另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基叉氢化物
4. 烯烃与烷基叉进行复分解，产生新的烯烃和烷基叉
5. 氢化和氢解步骤释放低级和高级烷烃同系物

单位点机制：
1. 钽烷基烷基叉中间体从钽氢化物形成
2. 烯烃的形成和转化发生在金属的配位球内
3. 交叉复分解产物来自烷烃与新戊基新戊基叉表面络合物的反应

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基叉氢中间体。关键过程涉及CH键活化、烯烃形成以及通过金属环丁烷中间体的CC键断裂/形成。

对于直链烷烃，反应主要产生n±1同系物，这是由于1-烯烃参与复分解。环烷烃经历类似的过程，但速率较低，通过γ-H活化和金属环丁烷中间体形成低级环状同系物。

这些催化剂的选择性和性能取决于：
1. 载体材料（二氧化硅、氧化铝等）
2. 使用的金属（Ta、W、Mo等）
3. 配体环境（氢化物、烷基、烷基叉）
4. 反应条件（温度、压力）

这些因素影响关键中间体的稳定性、基元步骤的速率和整体催化活性。形成和维持活性烷基叉物种的能力对于在各种烷烃转化中保持持续的催化性能至关重要。
