[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process,"

[4] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two proposed schemes: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. 

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which form in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The formation of alkenes is crucial in the homologation process, with 1-alkenes being the primary participants. This explains the selectivity towards n±1 linear homologues in the product distribution.

For cyclic alkanes, the catalyst can also facilitate hydrogenolysis, although at lower rates and with fewer turnovers compared to linear alkanes. This process involves the conversion of larger cyclic alkanes into smaller homologues.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by the formation and participation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The preference for 1-alkenes in the homologation process contributes to the specific product distribution observed, particularly the predominance of n±1 linear homologues.

Overall, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrates a complex interplay of CH bond activation, alkene formation, and metathesis processes, resulting in the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种提议的方案：双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程始于CH键活化，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。然后，一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基叉氢化物。

单位点机制涉及钽烷基烷基叉中间体，这些中间体原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基叉钽表面络合物形成。

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基叉氢化物作为关键中间体。烯烃的形成在同系化过程中至关重要，1-烯烃是主要参与者。这解释了产品分布中对n±1线性同系物的选择性。

对于环烷烃，催化剂也可以促进氢解，尽管与直链烷烃相比，反应速率较低，周转次数较少。这个过程涉及将较大的环烷烃转化为较小的同系物。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受到关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和参与的影响。1-烯烃在同系化过程中的优先参与贡献了所观察到的特定产品分布，特别是n±1线性同系物的优势。

总的来说，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理展示了CH键活化、烯烃形成和复分解过程的复杂相互作用，导致了直链和环状烷烃的转化。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two proposed schemes: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. This mechanism allows for the generation and transformation of alkenes on separate sites.

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. In this case, alkene formation and conversion occur within the coordination sphere of a single metal center.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The alkene metathesis process is crucial for the homologation of alkanes, primarily involving 1-alkenes. This results in the selective formation of n±1 linear homologues.

For cyclic alkanes, the catalyst also promotes hydrogenolysis, although at lower rates and with fewer turnovers compared to linear alkanes. This process leads to the formation of lower cyclic homologues.

The selectivity observed in alkane metathesis, particularly the predominance of n±1 linear homologues, is attributed to the alkene metathesis step and the preferential participation of 1-alkenes in the homologation process.

These mechanisms contribute to the catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions, allowing for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. The formation and role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes (implied in the metathesis process), are crucial for the overall reaction selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

单位点机制涉及由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基亚钽表面络合物原位形成的钽烷基烷基亚中间体。在这种情况下，烯烃的形成和转化发生在单个金属中心的配位球内。

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基亚氢化物作为关键中间体。烯烃复分解过程对烷烃的同系化至关重要，主要涉及1-烯烃。这导致选择性形成n±1线性同系物。

对于环烷烃，催化剂也促进氢解，尽管与线性烷烃相比，速率较低且周转次数较少。这个过程导致形成较低的环状同系物。

在烷烃复分解中观察到的选择性，特别是n±1线性同系物的优势，归因于烯烃复分解步骤和1-烯烃在同系化过程中的优先参与。

这些机制有助于催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能，允许线性和环状烷烃的转化。关键中间体的形成和作用，如烯烃和金属环丁烷（复分解过程中暗示的），对催化剂的整体反应选择性和效率至关重要。

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as crucial intermediates. The formation of alkenes is a primary step, followed by [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, which are key processes in alkene metathesis.

For linear alkanes, the selectivity towards higher homologues (mainly n±1 linear homologues) is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with 1-alkenes primarily participating.

Cyclic alkanes also undergo transformation, albeit at lower rates. The proposed mechanism for cyclic alkanes involves CH bond activation to form cycloalkyl derivatives, followed by γ-H activation. This produces a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion, hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

The formation and role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are crucial in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The ability to form these intermediates and control their subsequent reactions contributes to the effectiveness of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in various alkane conversions, including both linear and cyclic alkane transformations.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种提议的方案：双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程从C-H键活化开始，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，重新生成钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基叉氢化物。

单位点机制涉及钽烷基烷基叉中间体，这些中间体由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基叉钽表面络合物原位形成。

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基叉氢化物作为关键中间体。烯烃的形成是主要步骤，随后是[2+2]环加成和环反转，这些是烯烃复分解的关键过程。

对于直链烷烃，高级同系物的选择性（主要是n±1直链同系物）与烯烃复分解作为关键均化过程一致，主要是1-烯烃参与其中。

环烷烃也会发生转化，尽管速率较低。环烷烃的提议机制涉及C-H键活化形成环烷基衍生物，然后进行γ-H活化。这产生了一个金属环丁烷中间体，可以进行环反转、氢解、氢化和重排，生成较低环烷烃和非环烷烃同系物。

关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用对于决定反应选择性和催化剂性能至关重要。形成这些中间体并控制其后续反应的能力有助于二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物在各种烷烃转化中的有效性，包括直链和环状烷烃的转化。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism:
1. CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl species
2. One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides
3. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer
4. Alkene undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes
5. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps release lower and higher alkane homologues

One-site mechanism:
1. Tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates form from tantalum hydrides
2. Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere
3. Cross-metathesis products result from alkane reaction with neopentyl neopentylidene surface complexes

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. The key processes involve CH bond activation, alkene formation, and CC bond cleavage/formation through metallacyclobutane intermediates.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n±1 homologues due to 1-alkene participation in metathesis. Cyclic alkanes undergo similar processes but with lower rates, forming lower cyclic homologues through γ-H activation and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of these catalysts depend on:
1. Support material (silica, alumina, etc.)
2. Metal used (Ta, W, Mo, etc.)
3. Ligand environment (hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes)
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)

These factors influence the stability of key intermediates, rates of elementary steps, and overall catalytic activity. The ability to form and maintain active alkylidene species is crucial for sustained catalytic performance in various alkane conversions.
