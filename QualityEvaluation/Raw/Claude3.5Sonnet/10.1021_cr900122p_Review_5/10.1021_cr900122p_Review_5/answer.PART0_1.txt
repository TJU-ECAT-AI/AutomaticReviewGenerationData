[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[4] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[5] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two proposed schemes: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. This mechanism allows for the generation and transformation of alkenes on separate sites.

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. In this case, alkene formation and conversion occur within the coordination sphere of a single metal center.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The alkene metathesis process is crucial for the homologation of alkanes, primarily involving 1-alkenes. This results in the selective formation of n±1 linear homologues.

For cyclic alkanes, the catalyst also promotes hydrogenolysis, although at lower rates and with fewer turnovers compared to linear alkanes. This process leads to the formation of lower cyclic homologues.

The selectivity observed in alkane metathesis, particularly the predominance of n±1 linear homologues, is attributed to the alkene metathesis step and the preferential participation of 1-alkenes in the homologation process.

These mechanisms contribute to the catalyst's performance in various alkane conversions, allowing for the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes. The formation and role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes (implied in the metathesis process), are crucial for the overall reaction selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种提议的方案：双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程始于CH键活化，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。然后，一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基亚氢化物。这种机制允许在不同位点上生成和转化烯烃。

单位点机制涉及由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基亚钽表面络合物原位形成的钽烷基烷基亚中间体。在这种情况下，烯烃的形成和转化发生在单个金属中心的配位球内。

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基亚氢化物作为关键中间体。烯烃复分解过程对烷烃的同系化至关重要，主要涉及1-烯烃。这导致选择性形成n±1线性同系物。

对于环烷烃，催化剂也促进氢解，尽管与线性烷烃相比，速率较低且周转次数较少。这个过程导致形成较低的环状同系物。

在烷烃复分解中观察到的选择性，特别是n±1线性同系物的优势，归因于烯烃复分解步骤和1-烯烃在同系化过程中的优先参与。

这些机制有助于催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能，允许线性和环状烷烃的转化。关键中间体的形成和作用，如烯烃和金属环丁烷（复分解过程中暗示的），对催化剂的整体反应选择性和效率至关重要。
