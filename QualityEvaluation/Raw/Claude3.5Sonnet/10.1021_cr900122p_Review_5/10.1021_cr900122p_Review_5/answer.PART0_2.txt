[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[6] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two proposed schemes: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as crucial intermediates. The formation of alkenes is a primary step, followed by [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, which are key processes in alkene metathesis.

For linear alkanes, the selectivity towards higher homologues (mainly n±1 linear homologues) is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation process, with 1-alkenes primarily participating.

Cyclic alkanes also undergo transformation, albeit at lower rates. The proposed mechanism for cyclic alkanes involves CH bond activation to form cycloalkyl derivatives, followed by γ-H activation. This produces a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion, hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

The formation and role of key intermediates, such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, are crucial in determining the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. The ability to form these intermediates and control their subsequent reactions contributes to the effectiveness of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in various alkane conversions, including both linear and cyclic alkane transformations.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种提议的方案：双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程从C-H键活化开始，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，重新生成钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基叉氢化物。

单位点机制涉及钽烷基烷基叉中间体，这些中间体由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基叉钽表面络合物原位形成。

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基叉氢化物作为关键中间体。烯烃的形成是主要步骤，随后是[2+2]环加成和环反转，这些是烯烃复分解的关键过程。

对于直链烷烃，高级同系物的选择性（主要是n±1直链同系物）与烯烃复分解作为关键均化过程一致，主要是1-烯烃参与其中。

环烷烃也会发生转化，尽管速率较低。环烷烃的提议机制涉及C-H键活化形成环烷基衍生物，然后进行γ-H活化。这产生了一个金属环丁烷中间体，可以进行环反转、氢解、氢化和重排，生成较低环烷烃和非环烷烃同系物。

关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和作用对于决定反应选择性和催化剂性能至关重要。形成这些中间体并控制其后续反应的能力有助于二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物在各种烷烃转化中的有效性，包括直链和环状烷烃的转化。
