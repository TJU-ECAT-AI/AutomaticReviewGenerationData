[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process,"

[4] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[5] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two proposed schemes: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. 

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which form in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The formation of alkenes is crucial in the homologation process, with 1-alkenes being the primary participants. This explains the selectivity towards n±1 linear homologues in the product distribution.

For cyclic alkanes, the catalyst can also facilitate hydrogenolysis, although at lower rates and with fewer turnovers compared to linear alkanes. This process involves the conversion of larger cyclic alkanes into smaller homologues.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by the formation and participation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. The preference for 1-alkenes in the homologation process contributes to the specific product distribution observed, particularly the predominance of n±1 linear homologues.

Overall, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides demonstrates a complex interplay of CH bond activation, alkene formation, and metathesis processes, resulting in the transformation of both linear and cyclic alkanes.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种提议的方案：双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程始于CH键活化，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。然后，一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基叉氢化物。

单位点机制涉及钽烷基烷基叉中间体，这些中间体原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基叉钽表面络合物形成。

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基叉氢化物作为关键中间体。烯烃的形成在同系化过程中至关重要，1-烯烃是主要参与者。这解释了产品分布中对n±1线性同系物的选择性。

对于环烷烃，催化剂也可以促进氢解，尽管与直链烷烃相比，反应速率较低，周转次数较少。这个过程涉及将较大的环烷烃转化为较小的同系物。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受到关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和参与的影响。1-烯烃在同系化过程中的优先参与贡献了所观察到的特定产品分布，特别是n±1线性同系物的优势。

总的来说，由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理展示了CH键活化、烯烃形成和复分解过程的复杂相互作用，导致了直链和环状烷烃的转化。
