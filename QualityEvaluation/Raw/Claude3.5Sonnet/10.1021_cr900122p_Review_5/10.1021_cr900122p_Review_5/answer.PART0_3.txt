[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[4] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[5] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves two proposed schemes: a two-site mechanism and a one-site mechanism.

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation, forming H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene produced by the first site then undergoes homologation on the second site, leading to different alkene and alkylidene species.

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ from silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes. In this case, alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal center's coordination sphere.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The selectivity for higher homologues (mainly n±1 linear homologues) is consistent with alkene metathesis being the primary homologation process, with 1-alkenes playing a major role.

For cyclic alkanes, the process involves hydrogenolysis, albeit at lower rates. The proposed mechanism includes CH bond activation to form cycloalkyl derivatives, followed by γ-H activation. This produces a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion, hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues.

These factors contribute to the reaction selectivity and catalyst performance by controlling the distribution of products and the types of transformations possible. The ability to form specific intermediates and undergo particular elementary steps determines which products are favored and how efficiently the catalyst can convert various alkanes.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种提议的方案：双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程始于CH键活化，形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃，再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基叉氢化物。第一个位点产生的烯烃然后在第二个位点上进行均化，导致不同的烯烃和烷基叉物种。

单位点机制涉及由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基叉钽表面络合物原位形成的钽烷基烷基叉中间体。在这种情况下，烯烃的形成和转化发生在金属中心的配位球内。

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基叉氢化物作为关键中间体。对高级同系物的选择性（主要是n±1线性同系物）与烯烃复分解作为主要均化过程一致，其中1-烯烃起主要作用。

对于环烷烃，该过程涉及氢解，尽管速率较低。提议的机制包括CH键活化形成环烷基衍生物，然后进行γ-H活化。这产生了一个金属环丁烷中间体，它可以经历环反转、氢解、氢化和重排，产生较低环状和非环状烷烃同系物。

这些因素通过控制产物分布和可能的转化类型来影响反应选择性和催化剂性能。形成特定中间体和经历特定基元步骤的能力决定了哪些产物被优先生成，以及催化剂能够多么有效地转化各种烷烃。
