Unfortunately, this literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be about molybdenum imido olefin metathesis catalysts supported on silica, which is a different topic. There is no mention of tantalum hydrides, alkane metathesis mechanisms, or any of the specific processes or intermediates asked about in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given literature.

遗憾的是,这篇文献不包含任何与回答硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于硅胶负载的钼亚胺烯烃复分解催化剂的,这是一个不同的主题。文中没有提到钽氢化物、烷烃复分解机理,或问题中询问的任何具体过程或中间体。因此,我无法根据给定的文献提供答案。
