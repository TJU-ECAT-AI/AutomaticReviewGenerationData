          "Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

"This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds"

"kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor, revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride."

"Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."

"Recently, we have developed a W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, 1b, giving higher turnover numbers (TON) and having a much greater stability than Ta hydrides."

"The peculiarity of both systems lies in the fact that Ta or W hydrides are multifunctional–single site catalysts (alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis and olefin hydrogenation)."

          The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a single-site approach. The key steps in this process are:

1. Paraffin dehydrogenation: C-H bond activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl complex, which then produces an olefin and a metal-hydride.

2. Olefin metathesis: This occurs on a metallocarbene formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl.

3. Hydrogenation: The newly formed olefins are hydrogenated on the metal-hydride.

This mechanism allows for the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, involving both cleavage and formation of C-H and C-C bonds. The process can transform light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures.

For linear alkanes, such as propane, the reaction typically produces ethane (45-50%), butanes (30-35%), methane, and higher C5+ alkanes. The primary products of the reaction are olefins and H2.

The catalyst [(RSiO)2TaH] is described as a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. A newer catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, has been developed which gives higher turnover numbers and greater stability than the tantalum hydrides. Both the tantalum and tungsten hydride systems are characterized as multifunctional single-site catalysts, capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation.

The formation of key intermediates like olefins and metallocarbenes plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These intermediates facilitate the carbon transfer process and contribute to the overall selectivity of the reaction.

The provided information does not specifically discuss cyclic alkane transformations, two-site schemes, or the formation of metallacyclobutanes. It also doesn't provide detailed information on how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity in various alkane conversions beyond what has been mentioned for propane.

          由硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及单位点方法。该过程的关键步骤包括：

1. 烷烃脱氢：C-H键活化导致金属-烷基络合物的形成，随后形成烯烃和金属-氢化物。

2. 烯烃复分解：这发生在通过金属-烷基的α-H消除形成的金属卡宾上。

3. 加氢：新形成的烯烃在金属-氢化物上被加氢。

这种机制允许单个碳原子从一个链转移到另一个链，涉及C-H和C-C键的断裂和形成。该过程可以在中等温度下将轻烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。

对于直链烷烃，如丙烷，该反应通常产生乙烷（45-50%）、丁烷（30-35%）、甲烷和更高的C5+烷烃。反应的主要产物是烯烃和H2。

催化剂[(RSiO)2TaH]被描述为负载在硅胶上的高度亲电性钽氢化物。一种更新的催化剂W(H)3/Al2O3500已被开发，它具有更高的转化数和更好的稳定性，比钽氢化物更优越。钽和钨氢化物系统都被描述为多功能单位点催化剂，能够进行烷烃脱氢、烯烃复分解和烯烃加氢。

关键中间体如烯烃和金属卡宾的形成在反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体促进了碳转移过程，并有助于反应的整体选择性。

提供的信息未具体讨论环烷烃转化、双位点方案或金属环丁烷的形成。它也没有提供关于这些因素如何影响除丙烷以外的各种烷烃转化的反应选择性的详细信息。
