[1] "Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

[2] "Typically propane gives mainly ethane (4550%) and butanes (3035%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."

[3] "kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor, revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2."

[4] "This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a single-site approach. The key steps in this process are:

1. Paraffin dehydrogenation: CH bond activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl complex, which then produces an olefin and a metal-hydride.

2. Olefin metathesis: This occurs on a metallocarbene formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl.

3. Hydrogenation: The newly formed olefins are hydrogenated on the metal-hydride.

The primary products of the reaction are olefins and H2, as revealed by kinetic studies on propane metathesis. This mechanism allows for the transformation of light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures.

For example, in propane metathesis, the main products are ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes. This distribution of products reflects the selectivity of the reaction, which is influenced by the formation and reactivity of key intermediates such as olefins and metallacyclobutanes.

The catalyst's performance is demonstrated by its ability to transform various alkanes, including linear ones like propane. The single-site nature of the catalyst contributes to its effectiveness in catalyzing these transformations.

While the provided literature does not explicitly discuss cyclic alkane transformations or compare two-site and one-site schemes, it emphasizes the importance of the single-site approach in achieving alkane metathesis. The formation of olefins as primary products and their subsequent involvement in metathesis and hydrogenation steps are crucial for the overall reaction mechanism and selectivity.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及单点方法。该过程的关键步骤包括：

1. 烷烃脱氢：CH键活化导致形成金属-烷基络合物，然后产生烯烃和金属-氢化物。

2. 烯烃复分解：这发生在通过金属-烷基的α-H消除形成的金属卡宾上。

3. 加氢：新形成的烯烃在金属-氢化物上被加氢。

反应的主要产物是烯烃和H2，这是通过丙烷复分解的动力学研究揭示的。该机制允许在温和温度下将轻烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。

例如，在丙烷复分解中，主要产物是乙烷（45-50%）和丁烷（30-35%），以及甲烷和更高的C5+烷烃。这种产物分布反映了反应的选择性，其受到关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成和反应性的影响。

催化剂的性能通过其转化各种烷烃（包括线性烷烃如丙烷）的能力得到证明。催化剂的单点性质有助于其在催化这些转化反应中的有效性。

虽然所提供的文献没有明确讨论环烷烃的转化或比较双点和单点方案，但它强调了单点方法在实现烷烃复分解中的重要性。烯烃作为主要产物的形成及其随后在复分解和加氢步骤中的参与对整体反应机理和选择性至关重要。
