[3] "kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor, revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a single-site approach. The key steps in this process are:

1. Paraffin dehydrogenation: CH bond activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl, followed by the production of an olefin and a metal-hydride.

2. Olefin metathesis: This occurs on a metallocarbene formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl.

3. Hydrogenation: The newly formed olefins are hydrogenated on the metal-hydride.

This mechanism involves the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, through both cleavage and formation of C-H and C-C bonds. The primary products of the reaction are olefins and H2.

The catalyst [(RSiO)2TaH] is described as a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. It can catalytically transform light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures.

A newer catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, has been developed which gives higher turnover numbers and greater stability than the tantalum hydrides. Both the tantalum and tungsten hydride systems are characterized as multifunctional single-site catalysts, capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation.

The document does not provide specific information about cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of metallacyclobutanes. It also doesn't discuss in detail how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions beyond mentioning the higher turnover numbers and stability of the tungsten catalyst.

由硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及单位点方法。该过程的关键步骤包括：

1. 烷烃脱氢：C-H键活化导致形成金属-烷基，随后产生烯烃和金属-氢化物。

2. 烯烃复分解：这发生在通过金属-烷基的α-H消除形成的金属卡宾上。

3. 加氢：新形成的烯烃在金属-氢化物上被加氢。

这种机制涉及单个碳原子从一个链转移到另一个链，通过C-H和C-C键的断裂和形成。反应的主要产物是烯烃和H2。

催化剂[(RSiO)2TaH]被描述为负载在硅胶上的高度亲电性钽氢化物。它可以在温和的温度下催化将轻烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。

一种更新的催化剂W(H)3/Al2O3500已被开发，它具有更高的转化数和更好的稳定性，比钽氢化物更优越。钽和钨氢化物系统都被描述为多功能单位点催化剂，能够进行烷烃脱氢、烯烃复分解和烯烃加氢。

文献没有提供关于环烷烃转化或金属环丁烷形成的具体信息。它也没有详细讨论这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能，除了提到钨催化剂的更高转化数和稳定性。
