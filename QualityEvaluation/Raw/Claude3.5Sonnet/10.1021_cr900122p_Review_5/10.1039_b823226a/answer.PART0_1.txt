[1] "Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

[2] "Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."

[3] "This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via C–H bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride."

[4] "Recently, we have developed a W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, 1b, giving higher turnover numbers (TON) and having a much greater stability than Ta hydrides."

[5] "The peculiarity of both systems lies in the fact that Ta or W hydrides are multifunctional–single site catalysts (alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis and olefin hydrogenation)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a single-site approach. The key steps in this mechanism are:

1. Paraffin dehydrogenation: C-H bond activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl complex, which then produces an olefin and a metal-hydride.

2. Olefin metathesis: A metallocarbene is formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl. This metallocarbene then participates in olefin metathesis.

3. Olefin hydrogenation: The newly formed olefins are hydrogenated on the metal-hydride.

This single-site mechanism allows for the transformation of light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures. For example, propane metathesis typically yields ethane (45-50%), butanes (30-35%), methane, and higher C5+ alkanes.

The catalyst's multifunctionality is crucial for its performance. Both tantalum and tungsten hydrides act as single-site catalysts capable of performing alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation. This multifunctionality contributes to the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity in various alkane conversions.

It's worth noting that a tungsten-based catalyst (W(H)3/Al2O3500) has been developed more recently, showing higher turnover numbers and greater stability compared to tantalum hydrides. This improvement in catalyst performance demonstrates ongoing advancements in the field of alkane metathesis.

The formation of key intermediates, such as olefins and metallocarbenes, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These intermediates facilitate the transformation of alkanes into their homologues through the series of steps described above.

While the provided information doesn't specifically discuss cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of metallacyclobutanes, the general mechanism described can be applied to various alkane conversions. The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the catalyst's ability to perform multiple functions (dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) in a coordinated manner.

In summary, the single-site approach using supported tantalum or tungsten hydrides provides an efficient mechanism for alkane metathesis, allowing for the conversion of light alkanes into a range of products with good selectivity and catalyst performance.

通过硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及单位点方法。该机理的关键步骤包括：

1. 烷烃脱氢：C-H键活化导致形成金属-烷基络合物，然后产生烯烃和金属-氢化物。

2. 烯烃复分解：通过金属-烷基的α-H消除形成金属卡宾。这个金属卡宾随后参与烯烃复分解。

3. 烯烃氢化：新形成的烯烃在金属-氢化物上被氢化。

这种单位点机理允许在温和温度下将轻质烷烃转化为其低级和高级同系物。例如，丙烷复分解通常产生乙烷（45-50%）、丁烷（30-35%）、甲烷和更高的C5+烷烃。

催化剂的多功能性对其性能至关重要。钽和钨氢化物都作为单位点催化剂，能够进行烷烃脱氢、烯烃复分解和烯烃氢化。这种多功能性有助于催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的效率和选择性。

值得注意的是，最近开发了一种基于钨的催化剂（W(H)3/Al2O3500），与钽氢化物相比，它显示出更高的转化数和更大的稳定性。这种催化剂性能的改进表明了烷烃复分解领域的持续进展。

关键中间体（如烯烃和金属卡宾）的形成在反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体通过上述一系列步骤促进烷烃向其同系物的转化。

虽然所提供的信息没有特别讨论环烷烃转化或金属环丁烷的形成，但所描述的一般机理可以应用于各种烷烃转化。反应的选择性受催化剂以协调方式执行多种功能（脱氢、复分解和氢化）的能力影响。

总之，使用负载型钽或钨氢化物的单位点方法为烷烃复分解提供了一种高效的机制，允许将轻质烷烃转化为一系列具有良好选择性和催化剂性能的产物。
