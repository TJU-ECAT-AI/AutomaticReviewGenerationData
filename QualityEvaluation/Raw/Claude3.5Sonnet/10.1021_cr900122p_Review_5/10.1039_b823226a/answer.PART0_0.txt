[1] "Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

[2] "This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds"

[3] "kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor, revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride."

[4] "Recently, we have developed a W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, 1b, giving higher turnover numbers (TON) and having a much greater stability than Ta hydrides."

The document does not provide a comprehensive analysis of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides as requested in the question. Instead, it mainly focuses on tungsten-based catalysts and briefly mentions some aspects of tantalum-based catalysis. However, based on the limited information provided, we can discuss some key points about alkane metathesis:

1. The reaction was discovered in 1997 using a single-site approach with a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(RSiO)2TaH].

2. Alkane metathesis involves the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, through both cleavage and formation of C-H and C-C bonds.

3. The proposed mechanism for alkane metathesis (based on propane metathesis studies) involves three key steps:
   a) Paraffin dehydrogenation via C-H bond activation, leading to a metal-alkyl and subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride.
   b) Olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl.
   c) Hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride.

4. The primary products of the reaction are olefins and H2, as revealed by kinetic studies.

5. More recently, a tungsten-based catalyst (W(H)3/Al2O3500) was developed, which shows higher turnover numbers and greater stability compared to tantalum hydrides.

The document does not provide detailed information on two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, or specific details on the formation and role of key intermediates like metallacyclobutanes. It also doesn't discuss how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions beyond the brief mention of the tungsten catalyst's improved performance.

该文档并未提供问题所要求的硅胶负载钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解的全面分析。相反，它主要集中讨论了钨基催化剂，并简要提及了一些钽基催化的方面。然而，根据所提供的有限信息，我们可以讨论烷烃复分解的一些关键点：

1. 这个反应是在1997年使用单一位点方法发现的，采用了负载在硅胶上的高度亲电性钽氢化物[(RSiO)2TaH]。

2. 烷烃复分解涉及单个碳原子从一个链转移到另一个链，通过C-H和C-C键的断裂和形成。

3. 烷烃复分解的提议机理（基于丙烷复分解研究）包括三个关键步骤：
   a) 通过C-H键活化的烷烃脱氢，形成金属-烷基，随后生成烯烃和金属-氢化物。
   b) 在金属-烷基通过α-H消除形成的金属卡宾上进行烯烃复分解。
   c) 在金属-氢化物上对新生成的烯烃进行氢化。

4. 动力学研究表明，反应的主要产物是烯烃和H2。

5. 最近开发了一种钨基催化剂（W(H)3/Al2O3500），与钽氢化物相比，它显示出更高的转化数和更大的稳定性。

该文档没有提供关于双位点和单位点方案的详细信息，也没有涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的过程，或关于关键中间体（如金属环丁烷）形成和作用的具体细节。除了简要提及钨催化剂性能改进外，它也没有讨论这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能。
