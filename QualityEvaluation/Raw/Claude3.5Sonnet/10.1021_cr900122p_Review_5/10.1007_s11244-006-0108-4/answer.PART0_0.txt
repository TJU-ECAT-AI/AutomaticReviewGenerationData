[1] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

[2] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

[3] "Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

[4] "The ratio of linear to branched products is due to the relative amount of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the initial CH bond activation step [11,12]."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: 
   a) Carbene hydride species form through α-H abstraction
   b) Olefin hydride species form through β-H abstraction
   
3. Metallacycle formation: The carbene and olefin intermediates interact to form a tantallacyclobutane.

4. Product formation: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. These are then hydrogenated to produce new alkanes.

5. Selectivity control: The selectivity of products is governed by [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates.

6. Linear vs. branched products: The ratio of linear to branched products is determined by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H activation step.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur at a single metal center. In a two-site scheme, the alkane activation and olefin formation may occur at one site, while the metathesis reaction occurs at another.

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism would be similar, but the metallacyclobutane intermediates would be part of a larger ring system.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins then participate in the classical olefin metathesis cycle involving carbenes and metallacyclobutanes.

Catalyst performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions depend on:
1. The efficiency of initial C-H activation
2. The relative rates of α-H and β-H abstraction
3. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates
4. The steric and electronic factors influencing the formation of linear vs. branched products

This mechanism explains the observed product distributions and allows for the rational design of improved catalysts for alkane metathesis.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和中间体：

1. 启动：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃的C-H键活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 关键中间体的形成：
   a) 通过α-H抽提形成卡宾氢化物物种
   b) 通过β-H抽提形成烯烃氢化物物种
   
3. 金属环形成：卡宾和烯烃中间体相互作用形成钽杂环丁烷。

4. 产物形成：钽杂环丁烷分解产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。这些随后被氢化生成新的烷烃。

5. 选择性控制：产物的选择性由金属杂环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定。

6. 直链与支链产物：直链和支链产物的比例由初始C-H活化步骤中形成的直链与异构烷基中间体的相对数量决定。

这种机理支持单点和双点方案。在单点方案中，所有步骤都在单个金属中心进行。在双点方案中，烷烃活化和烯烃形成可能在一个位点发生，而复分解反应在另一个位点发生。

对于环状烷烃，机理将类似，但金属杂环丁烷中间体将是更大环系统的一部分。

烯烃作为初级产物的形成，以及氢气的产生，对整个复分解过程至关重要。这些烯烃随后参与涉及卡宾和金属杂环丁烷的经典烯烃复分解循环。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性取决于：
1. 初始C-H活化的效率
2. α-H和β-H抽提的相对速率
3. 金属杂环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性
4. 影响直链与支链产物形成的立体和电子因素

这种机理解释了观察到的产物分布，并允许合理设计改进的烷烃复分解催化剂。
