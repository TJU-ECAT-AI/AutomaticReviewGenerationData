[1] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction."

[2] "On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

[3] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

[4] "Concerning the selectivities of the reaction obtained with the various hydrides (figure 5), it turns out that tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones; in particular, a smaller amount of methane and pentanes is formed. Both these products come from the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane, which should be less favoured with tungsten than tantalum (scheme 2)."

[5] "Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Initial CH bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of the CH bond in the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Through α-H and β-H abstractions on the alkyl complex, carbene hydride and olefin hydride species are formed. These are crucial intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The interaction between the carbene and olefin leads to the formation of a tantallacyclobutane intermediate. This step is analogous to the mechanism in olefin metathesis.

4. Decomposition and product formation: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. These products then undergo hydrogenation to form new alkanes.

5. Primary product formation: Studies have shown that olefins and hydrogen are primary products in this reaction, supporting the proposed mechanism.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by several factors:

1. Substituent interactions: The [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates govern product selectivity.

2. Metallacyclobutane geometry: 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes lead to the formation of methane and pentanes. The formation of these products is less favored with tungsten catalysts compared to tantalum, resulting in a narrower product distribution.

3. Catalyst metal: Tungsten-based catalysts generally produce a narrower distribution of products compared to tantalum-based catalysts, indicating that the choice of metal significantly affects selectivity.

The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, with the specific products depending on the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed during the reaction.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss one-site versus two-site mechanisms, the described process suggests a one-site mechanism where all steps occur on a single metal center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism cannot be entirely ruled out based on the provided information.

The performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depends on its ability to efficiently carry out each step of the mechanism, particularly the initial CH bond activation and the formation and decomposition of the metallacyclobutane intermediates. The choice of metal (tantalum or tungsten) and support (silica or alumina) can significantly impact these processes and, consequently, the overall catalytic performance.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. 初始CH键活化：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃CH键的活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 关键中间体的形成：通过烷基络合物的α-H和β-H抽取，形成卡宾氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。这些是催化循环中的关键中间体。

3. 金属杂环丁烷的形成：卡宾和烯烃之间的相互作用导致形成钽杂环丁烷中间体。这一步类似于烯烃复分解的机理。

4. 分解和产物形成：钽杂环丁烷分解产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。这些产物随后经过氢化形成新的烷烃。

5. 初级产物形成：研究表明，烯烃和氢气是该反应的初级产物，支持了proposed的机理。

反应的选择性受几个因素影响：

1. 取代基相互作用：金属杂环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定了产物选择性。

2. 金属杂环丁烷几何构型：1,2-二取代金属杂环丁烷导致甲烷和戊烷的形成。与钽相比，这些产物在钨催化剂中的形成较少，导致产物分布更窄。

3. 催化剂金属：与钽基催化剂相比，钨基催化剂通常产生更窄的产物分布，表明金属的选择显著影响选择性。

该机理允许线性和环状烷烃转化，具体产物取决于反应过程中形成的金属杂环丁烷中间体的性质。

虽然文献没有明确讨论单位点与双位点机制，但所描述的过程暗示了一个单位点机制，其中所有步骤都发生在单个金属中心上。然而，根据所提供的信息，不能完全排除双位点机制的可能性。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能取决于其有效执行机理中每个步骤的能力，特别是初始CH键活化以及金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成和分解。金属（钽或钨）和载体（硅胶或氧化铝）的选择可以显著影响这些过程，从而影响整体催化性能。
