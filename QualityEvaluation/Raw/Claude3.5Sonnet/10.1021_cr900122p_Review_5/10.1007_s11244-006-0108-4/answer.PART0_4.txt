[1] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

[2] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

[3] "Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

[4] "The ratio of linear to branched products is due to the relative amount of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the initial CH bond activation step [11,12]."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Olefin formation: α-H and β-H abstractions on the alkyl complex produce carbene hydride and olefin hydride species. These olefins are primary products along with hydrogen.

3. Metallacycle formation: The carbene and olefin interact to form a tantallacyclobutane intermediate.

4. Metathesis: The metallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin.

5. Product formation: Hydrogenation of the new olefins produces the new alkanes.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur on a single metal center. In a two-site scheme, olefin formation and metallacycle formation/decomposition could occur on separate sites.

For linear and cyclic alkanes, the basic steps remain the same, but the specific intermediates and product distributions may differ. Cyclic alkanes may form more complex metallacycles.

The selectivity of the reaction is governed by [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. This affects the distribution of linear vs. branched products. The initial C-H activation step also influences the ratio of linear to branched products based on the formation of linear vs. iso-alkyl intermediates.

Catalyst performance in various alkane conversions depends on the metal's ability to facilitate each step, particularly C-H activation, olefin formation, and metallacycle formation/decomposition. The stability of intermediates and the rates of various steps can significantly impact overall activity and selectivity.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和中间体：

1. 引发：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃的C-H键活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 烯烃形成：烷基络合物上的α-H和β-H消除产生卡宾氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。这些烯烃与氢气一起是主要产物。

3. 金属环形成：卡宾和烯烃相互作用形成钽杂环丁烷中间体。

4. 复分解：金属环丁烷分解，产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。

5. 产物形成：新烯烃的氢化生成新的烷烃。

这一机理支持单位点和双位点方案。在单位点方案中，所有步骤都在单个金属中心上进行。在双位点方案中，烯烃形成和金属环形成/分解可能在不同的位点上进行。

对于直链和环状烷烃，基本步骤保持不变，但具体的中间体和产物分布可能有所不同。环状烷烃可能形成更复杂的金属环。

反应的选择性由金属环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定。这影响直链vs.支链产物的分布。初始C-H活化步骤也会通过直链vs.异构烷基中间体的形成影响直链对支链产物的比例。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能取决于金属促进每个步骤的能力，特别是C-H活化、烯烃形成和金属环形成/分解。中间体的稳定性和各步骤的速率可以显著影响整体活性和选择性。
