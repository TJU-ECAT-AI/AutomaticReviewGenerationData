[1] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

[2] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

[3] "Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: 
   a) Carbene hydride species form through α-H abstraction
   b) Olefin hydride species form through β-H abstraction
   
3. Metallacycle formation: The carbene and olefin intermediates interact to form a tantallacyclobutane.

4. Product formation: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. These are then hydrogenated to produce new alkanes.

5. Selectivity control: The selectivity of products is governed by [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates.

6. Linear vs. branched products: The ratio of linear to branched products is determined by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H activation step.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur at a single metal center. In a two-site scheme, the alkane activation and olefin formation may occur at one site, while the metathesis reaction occurs at another.

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism would be similar, but the metallacyclobutane intermediates would be part of a larger ring system.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins then participate in the classical olefin metathesis cycle involving carbenes and metallacyclobutanes.

Catalyst performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions depend on:
1. The efficiency of initial C-H activation
2. The relative rates of α-H and β-H abstraction
3. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates
4. The steric and electronic factors influencing the formation of linear vs. branched products

This mechanism explains the observed product distributions and allows for the rational design of improved catalysts for alkane metathesis.

6. 直链与支链产物：直链和支链产物的比例由初始C-H活化步骤中形成的直链与异构烷基中间体的相对数量决定。

这种机理支持单点和双点方案。在单点方案中，所有步骤都在单个金属中心进行。在双点方案中，烷烃活化和烯烃形成可能在一个位点发生，而复分解反应在另一个位点发生。

对于环状烷烃，机理将类似，但金属杂环丁烷中间体将是更大环系统的一部分。

烯烃作为初级产物的形成，以及氢气的产生，对整个复分解过程至关重要。这些烯烃随后参与涉及卡宾和金属杂环丁烷的经典烯烃复分解循环。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性取决于：
1. 初始C-H活化的效率
2. α-H和β-H抽提的相对速率
3. 金属杂环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性
4. 影响直链与支链产物形成的立体和电子因素

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Initial CH bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of the CH bond in the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Through α-H and β-H abstractions on the alkyl complex, carbene hydride and olefin hydride species are formed. These are crucial intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The interaction between the carbene and olefin leads to the formation of a tantallacyclobutane intermediate. This step is analogous to the mechanism in olefin metathesis.

4. Decomposition and product formation: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. These products then undergo hydrogenation to form new alkanes.

5. Primary product formation: Studies have shown that olefins and hydrogen are primary products in this reaction, supporting the proposed mechanism.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by several factors:

1. Substituent interactions: The [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates govern product selectivity.

2. Metallacyclobutane geometry: 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes lead to the formation of methane and pentanes. The formation of these products is less favored with tungsten catalysts compared to tantalum, resulting in a narrower product distribution.

3. Catalyst metal: Tungsten-based catalysts generally produce a narrower distribution of products compared to tantalum-based catalysts, indicating that the choice of metal significantly affects selectivity.

The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, with the specific products depending on the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed during the reaction.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss one-site versus two-site mechanisms, the described process suggests a one-site mechanism where all steps occur on a single metal center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism cannot be entirely ruled out based on the provided information.

The performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depends on its ability to efficiently carry out each step of the mechanism, particularly the initial CH bond activation and the formation and decomposition of the metallacyclobutane intermediates. The choice of metal (tantalum or tungsten) and support (silica or alumina) can significantly impact these processes and, consequently, the overall catalytic performance.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. 初始CH键活化：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃CH键的活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 关键中间体的形成：通过烷基络合物的α-H和β-H抽取，形成卡宾氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。这些是催化循环中的关键中间体。

3. 金属杂环丁烷的形成：卡宾和烯烃之间的相互作用导致形成钽杂环丁烷中间体。这一步类似于烯烃复分解的机理。

4. 分解和产物形成：钽杂环丁烷分解产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。这些产物随后经过氢化形成新的烷烃。

5. 初级产物形成：研究表明，烯烃和氢气是该反应的初级产物，支持了proposed的机理。

反应的选择性受几个因素影响：

1. 取代基相互作用：金属杂环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定了产物选择性。

2. 金属杂环丁烷几何构型：1,2-二取代金属杂环丁烷导致甲烷和戊烷的形成。与钽相比，这些产物在钨催化剂中的形成较少，导致产物分布更窄。

3. 催化剂金属：与钽基催化剂相比，钨基催化剂通常产生更窄的产物分布，表明金属的选择显著影响选择性。

该机理允许线性和环状烷烃转化，具体产物取决于反应过程中形成的金属杂环丁烷中间体的性质。

虽然文献没有明确讨论单位点与双位点机制，但所描述的过程暗示了一个单位点机制，其中所有步骤都发生在单个金属中心上。然而，根据所提供的信息，不能完全排除双位点机制的可能性。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能取决于其有效执行机理中每个步骤的能力，特别是初始CH键活化以及金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成和分解。金属（钽或钨）和载体（硅胶或氧化铝）的选择可以显著影响这些过程，从而影响整体催化性能。

6. Linear vs. branched products: The ratio of linear to branched products is influenced by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H bond activation step.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur on a single tantalum center. In a two-site scheme, different tantalum centers may be involved in the various steps, such as C-H activation, olefin formation, and metathesis.

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism would be similar, but the metallacyclobutane intermediates would involve ring structures, potentially leading to different product distributions compared to linear alkanes.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins can then participate in further reactions, leading to the redistribution of carbon chains characteristic of alkane metathesis.

Catalyst performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions depend on several factors:

1. The efficiency of C-H bond activation
2. The stability and reactivity of carbene and olefin intermediates
3. The relative rates of metallacyclobutane formation and decomposition
4. The hydrogenation rates of newly formed olefins

These factors can vary depending on the specific alkane substrate, reaction conditions, and catalyst structure, leading to differences in activity and selectivity across different alkane conversions.

Olefins play a key role as primary products and intermediates in the catalytic cycle. They are formed through β-H abstraction and subsequently participate in metallacycle formation.

Catalyst performance and selectivity can change over time due to modifications in the coordination sphere of the active site. This may lead to an increase in linear products as the reaction progresses.

The mechanism allows for the conversion of various alkanes, but the efficiency may differ depending on the specific alkane. Factors such as the ease of initial C-H activation and olefin formation can influence the overall performance for different alkane substrates.
