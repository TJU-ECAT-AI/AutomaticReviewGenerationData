[1] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

[2] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

[3] "The selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

[4] "The ratio of linear to branched products is due to the relative amount of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the initial CH bond activation step [11,12]."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: The surface alkyl complex undergoes α-H or β-H abstractions to form carbene hydride and olefin hydride species. These are crucial intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The carbene and olefin species interact to form a tantallacyclobutane intermediate, similar to the mechanism in olefin metathesis.

4. Product formation: The metallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin. These products then undergo hydrogenation to form new alkanes.

5. Selectivity control: The selectivity of the reaction is governed by [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. This determines the distribution of linear and branched products.

6. Linear vs. branched products: The ratio of linear to branched products is influenced by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H bond activation step.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur on a single tantalum center. In a two-site scheme, different tantalum centers may be involved in the various steps, such as C-H activation, olefin formation, and metathesis.

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism would be similar, but the metallacyclobutane intermediates would involve ring structures, potentially leading to different product distributions compared to linear alkanes.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins can then participate in further reactions, leading to the redistribution of carbon chains characteristic of alkane metathesis.

Catalyst performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions depend on several factors:

1. The efficiency of C-H bond activation
2. The stability and reactivity of carbene and olefin intermediates
3. The relative rates of metallacyclobutane formation and decomposition
4. The hydrogenation rates of newly formed olefins

These factors can vary depending on the specific alkane substrate, reaction conditions, and catalyst structure, leading to differences in activity and selectivity across different alkane conversions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解反应机理涉及几个关键步骤和中间体：

1. 引发：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃的C-H键活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 形成关键中间体：表面烷基络合物经α-H或β-H消除形成卡宾氢化物和烯烃氢化物物种。这些是催化循环中的关键中间体。

3. 金属环丁烷形成：卡宾和烯烃物种相互作用形成钽环丁烷中间体，类似于烯烃复分解的机理。

4. 产物形成：金属环丁烷分解产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。这些产物随后经氢化形成新的烷烃。

5. 选择性控制：反应的选择性由金属环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定。这决定了直链和支链产物的分布。

6. 直链vs支链产物：直链和支链产物的比例受初始C-H键活化步骤中形成的直链与异构烷基中间体相对数量的影响。

这种机理支持单位点和双位点方案。在单位点方案中，所有步骤都发生在单个钽中心。在双位点方案中，不同的钽中心可能参与各种步骤，如C-H活化、烯烃形成和复分解。

对于环烷烃，机理类似，但金属环丁烷中间体会涉及环状结构，可能导致与直链烷烃相比产物分布不同。

烯烃作为初级产物的形成，以及氢气的产生，对整个复分解过程至关重要。这些烯烃随后可以参与进一步的反应，导致烷烃复分解特有的碳链重新分配。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性取决于几个因素：

1. C-H键活化的效率
2. 卡宾和烯烃中间体的稳定性和反应性
3. 金属环丁烷形成和分解的相对速率
4. 新形成烯烃的氢化速率

这些因素可能因特定的烷烃底物、反应条件和催化剂结构而异，导致不同烷烃转化过程中活性和选择性的差异。
