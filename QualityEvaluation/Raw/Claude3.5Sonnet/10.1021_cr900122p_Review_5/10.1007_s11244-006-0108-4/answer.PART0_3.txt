[1] "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

[2] "Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

[3] "Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

[4] "The ratio of linear to branched products is due to the relative amount of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the initial CH bond activation step [11,12]. The increase of linear products, as the reaction proceeds, is probably the result of a change over time of the coordination sphere of the active site."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and intermediates:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: 
   a) Carbene hydride species form through α-H abstraction
   b) Olefin hydride species form through β-H abstraction
   
3. Metallacycle formation: The carbene and olefin intermediates interact to form a tantallacyclobutane.

4. Metallacycle decomposition: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to produce a new carbene and a new olefin.

5. Product formation: Hydrogenation of the new olefins produces new alkanes.

The selectivity of the reaction is governed by [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates. This affects the distribution of linear vs. branched products.

The mechanism appears to primarily follow a one-site scheme, where all steps occur on a single tantalum center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism involving hydride transfer between metal centers cannot be completely ruled out based on the given information.

For both linear and cyclic alkanes, the initial C-H activation step is crucial in determining product distribution. The relative amounts of linear vs. iso-alkyl intermediates formed in this step influence the ratio of linear to branched products.

Olefins play a key role as primary products and intermediates in the catalytic cycle. They are formed through β-H abstraction and subsequently participate in metallacycle formation.

Catalyst performance and selectivity can change over time due to modifications in the coordination sphere of the active site. This may lead to an increase in linear products as the reaction progresses.

The mechanism allows for the conversion of various alkanes, but the efficiency may differ depending on the specific alkane. Factors such as the ease of initial C-H activation and olefin formation can influence the overall performance for different alkane substrates.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和中间体：

1. 引发：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃的C-H键活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 形成关键中间体：
   a) 通过α-H消除形成卡宾氢化物物种
   b) 通过β-H消除形成烯烃氢化物物种
   
3. 金属环形成：卡宾和烯烃中间体相互作用形成钽杂环丁烷。

4. 金属环分解：钽杂环丁烷分解产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。

5. 产物形成：新烯烃的氢化产生新的烷烃。

反应的选择性由金属环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定。这影响了直链与支链产物的分布。

该机理主要似乎遵循单位点方案，其中所有步骤都发生在单个钽中心上。然而，基于给定信息，不能完全排除涉及金属中心之间氢化物转移的双位点机制的可能性。

对于直链和环状烷烃，初始C-H活化步骤对于确定产物分布至关重要。在这一步骤中形成的直链与异构烷基中间体的相对数量影响了直链与支链产物的比例。

烯烃作为主要产物和中间体在催化循环中起关键作用。它们通过β-H消除形成，随后参与金属环的形成。

随着时间的推移，由于活性位点配位球的变化，催化剂性能和选择性可能会发生变化。这可能导致随着反应进行，直链产物增加。

该机制允许各种烷烃的转化，但效率可能因特定烷烃而异。初始C-H活化和烯烃形成的难易程度等因素可能影响不同烷烃底物的整体性能。
