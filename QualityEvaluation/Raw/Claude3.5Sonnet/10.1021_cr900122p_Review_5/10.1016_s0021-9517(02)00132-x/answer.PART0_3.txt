The provided literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document primarily focuses on zeolite catalysts and their applications in various reactions, including acid catalysis, base catalysis, and redox catalysis. It does not discuss tantalum hydrides or alkane metathesis mechanisms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the given information.
