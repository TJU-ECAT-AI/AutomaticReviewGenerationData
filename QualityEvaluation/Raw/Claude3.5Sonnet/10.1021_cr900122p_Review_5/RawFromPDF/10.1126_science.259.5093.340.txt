A homogeneous system for the selective, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol via
methyl bisulfate is reported. The net reaction catalyzed by mercuric ions, Hg(ll), is the
oxidation of methane by concentrated sulfuric acid to produce methyl bisulfate, water, and
sulfur dioxide. The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50 percent, 85 percent
selectivity to methyl bisulfate (-43 percent yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide)
was achieved at a molar productivity of 10-7 mole per cubic centimeter per second and
Hg(ll) turnover frequency of 10-3 per second. Separate hydrolysis of methyl bisulfate and
reoxidation of the sulfur dioxide with air provides a potentially practical scheme for the
oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen. The primary steps of the Hg(ll)-
catalyzed reaction were individually examined and the essential elements of the mech-
anism were identified. The Hg(ll) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement
mechanism to produce an observable species, CH3HgOSO3H, 1. Under the reaction
conditions, 1 readily decomposes to CH30SO3H and the reduced mercurous species,
Hg22
The catalytic cycle is completed by the reoxidation of Hg22+ with H2S04 to re-
generate Hg(ll) and byproducts S02 and H20. Thallium(lIl), palladium(ll), and the cations
of platinum and gold also oxidize methane to methyl bisulfate in sulfuric acid.
One of nature's great challenges to the
scientist is the selective oxidation of meth-
ane (the primary component in natural gas)
to methanol or another efficiently trans-
portable material. Methane is an abundant
resource that could serve as an efficient fuel
source and chemical feedstock. The known
and projected world reserves of natural gas,
more than 9000 trillion cubic feet (250,000
trillion liters), are comparable to those of
petroleum (1). However, petroleum is to-
day's primary energy source and chemical
feedstock, and the current use of methane is
relatively small. If methane could be used
efficiently, it could replace projected dwin-
dling petroleum reserves in the 21st centu-
ry. Efficient utilization of methane is chal-
lenging because the largest reserves are in
remote locations, far from centers of con-
sumption. This situation, coupled with the
gaseous state and low boiling point of meth-
ane (- 164°C), makes this
resource
too
expensive
to transport
(2). An obvious
solution is the conversion of methane to
methanol or other efficiently transportable
liquid material at the remote site before
transportation. Such processes have been
developed, but current technology based on
the high-temperature (>900C),
energy-
intensive conversion of methane and water
to carbon monoxide and hydrogen is uneco-
nomical. The scientific and engineering
community accepts
as
a general,
conser-
vative
guideline
that
a
high-selectivity
340
(>85%), high-conversion (.30%) (3) pro-
cess for the oxidation of methane to meth-
anol with molecular oxygen
as the final
oxidant could provide the basis for an eco-
nomical process for the conversion of meth-
ane to a transportable material (4).
Methane is a very unreactive molecule,
as demonstrated by the high C-H bond
strength [D(C-H)
= 438.8 kJ/molJ, high
ionization potential (12.5 eV), low proton
affinity (4.4 eV), and low acidity (pKa =
48) of the molecule. Methane can be made
to
react by using
very reactive
species.
Radicals are among the most reactive spe-
cies, and radical chemistry has been tradi-
tionally used for reaction with methane.
These species can be generated under very
forcing conditions
or with very reactive
reagents. However, under these conditions,
the initial (and more useful) products (5) of
reaction are more reactive than methane,
and selective reaction of methane in high
yield is very difficult. Thus, reactions with
oxygen can be accomplished but require
temperatures above 700°C. Under these
conditions, only low selectivities (<30%)
to methanol have been reported at methane
conversions above 10%, giving -3% over-
all yields (6). Reactions with more reactive
species such as chlorine can be carried out
at 350°C, but the reaction selectivity to
methyl chloride is still low and significant
amounts of polychlorinated methanes
are
generated (7). Given the low proton affin-
ity and acidity of methane, it would not be
expected that reaction of typical acids or
bases with methane would occur at temper-
atures lower than those of radical processes.

This unreactivity has been found to be the
case. Only with extremely reactive species,
such as protons in "superacid" media (SbF5/
HF), are reactions with methane observed
at lower temperatures (8). However, these
reactions are stoichiometric or use expen-
sive reagents and thus are not practical for
the large-scale oxidation of methane.
We describe the use of Hg(II) to catalyze
the selective oxidation ofmethane to meth-
anol, through methyl bisulfate,
in high
yield, -43% (9). The reaction occurs un-
der mild conditions (180'C) with reagents
that can potentially be used on
a large
scale. The keys to this discovery are the
novel use of Hg(II)
as a catalyst for the
oxidation of methane through an electro-
philic displacement reaction (10) and the
production of the monomethyl ester of sul-
furic acid, methyl bisulfate, as a methanol
precursor that is less reactive than meth-
ane.
A significant amount of work exploring
the electrophilic reactions of alkanes with
transition metals has been reported (11,
12). However, to our knowledge, the elec-
trophilic reaction of methane with Hg(II),
a posttransition metal, has not been report-
ed (13). Hg(II) is a "soft" (14), powerful
electrophile with good oxidizing properties
(15). Consistent with these properties, this
cation is known to readily activate (16)
arenes by electrophilic displacement, gen-
erating stable aryl mercury species (Eq. 1)
(11, 12):
ArH + Hg(II)
--
Ar-Hg(II)
+ H+
(1)
Related
electrophiles,
palladium(II)
and
platinum(II), have also been reported to
activate and oxidize
arenes
(17). These
species as well as Co(III) have been report-
ed
to
react with methane,
presumably
through a methyl metal species (Eq. 2), to
produce methyl esters in the cases of Pd(II)
(18) and Co(III) (19) and methanol and
methyl chloride in the case of Pt(II) (12):
CH4 + Mn+
--
CH3-Mn+I + H+
CH3X + M(n-2)+
X = CF3CO2, OH, Cl
Mn+ = Pd2+, Pt2+ Co3+
(2)
The reactions with Pt(II), first reported by
Shilov in 1972, have played a central role
in focusing attention on the important field
of alkane chemistry with transition metals.
However, the Pt(II), Pd(II) and Co(III)
systems are all characterized by low yields,
and only limited success has been reported
in making these reactions catalytic in the
metals.
We have found that the stoichiometric
reaction of methane with mercuric triflate
in triflic acid at 180°C results in an almost
quantitative yield of methyl triflate based
on added mercuric triflate (20). In this

reaction, the mercuric triflate is reduced to
mercurous triflate (no metallic mercury is
observed) as shown in Eq. 3:
CH4 + 2 Hg(CF3S03)2 -* CF3SO3CH3
+ CF3SO3H + Hg2(CF3S03)2
(3)
The reaction was also found to proceed
efficiently in 100% sulfuric acid to produce
the corresponding methyl ester, methyl
bisulfate. Moreover, in this solvent the
reaction is catalytic in mercuric ions, with
sulfuric acid playing the role of oxidant.
The reaction stoichiometry is shown in
Eq. 4:
Hg(II)
CH4 + 2 H2S04 -
a CH30SO3H
+ 2 H20 + SO2
(4)
Consistent with this stoichiometry, the co-
production of sulfur dioxide was observed.
The reaction is quite efficient and, to our
knowledge, unprecedented. In batch reac-
tions, methane conversions as high as 50%
at 85%
selectivity
to methyl
bisulfate
(~43% yield; the major side product is
carbon dioxide) and molar productivity
rates of 1O-7 mol cm-3 s-1 with Hg(II)
turnover frequencies of 10-3 s-' have been
observed (21). Consistent with the high
yield of methyl bisulfate, control experi-
ments have shown that the rate of oxida-
tion of methyl bisulfate by the Hg(II)-
sulfuric acid system is less than the rate of
oxidation of methane. The methyl bisulfate
solution produced in the reaction can be
readily hydrolyzed (Eq. 5) and the metha-
nol can be isolated by distillation:
CH30SO3H + H20 -_
CH30H + H2S04
(5)
Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric
(GC-MS) analyses of isolated samples of
methanol
produced
from
'3C-enriched
methane confirmed that the methanol is
produced from the oxidation of methane
(and not some carbon-containing contam-
inant). Thallium(III), palladium(II), and
the cations of platinum and gold have also
been shown to oxidize methane in triflic
and sulfuric
acids to the corresponding
methyl esters.
The conversion ofmethane to methanol
with the concomitant reduction of sulfuric
acid to sulfur dioxide (Eqs. 4 and 5) cannot,
as such, be the basis for an economical
synthesis of methanol. However, sulfuric
acid is the single largest commodity chem-
ical produced in the world today and is
prepared from the oxidation of sulfur diox-
ide. Thus, the technology for the reoxida-
tion of sulfur dioxide
to
sulfuric
acid
(through sulfur trioxide) with air (20%
oxygen) is practiced on a large scale and is
relatively inexpensive. By combining this
step with reactions shown in Eqs. 4 and 5,
a potentially practical process can be de-
scribed.
Such an
integrated scheme
is
shown in Scheme 1.

In this scheme, sulfuric acid functions as an
oxygen-atom
transfer
reagent. The
net
transformation of the established steps is
the selective oxidation ofmethane to meth-
anol with molecular oxygen. Compared to
the typical 3% yields obtained for the gas-
phase oxidation of methane to methanol
(6), the ~43% methanol yield disclosed in
this report represents a significant advance.
The catalyzed oxidation of methane by
mercuric ions is a remarkably efficient reac-
tion. Understanding the molecular basis for
such a system would be valuable to the
continuing search for even more efficient
methane oxidation catalysts. Three key
steps in the catalytic sequence have been
established. The working model based on
the available data is shown in Scheme 2.

The activation of methane is proposed to

cies then decomposes to the product and the

step.

furic acid, regenerating mercuric bisulfate.
In the activation step, an electrophilic
displacement mechanism
is assumed be-
cause of the similarity of this reaction to
other electrophilic reactions involving hy-
drocarbons and metal electrophiles, such as
the reactions of Pt(II) with alkanes (Eq. 2)
and the well-established electrophilic sub-
stitution reaction of arenes with Hg(II)
(Eq. 1). Thus, weakly basic counteranions
to Hg(II) have been found to facilitate the
reaction,
whereas
electron
withdrawing
groups substituted for a C-H bond on meth-
ane disfavored reaction. We have observed
that methane activation occurs readily (in
the corresponding acids) with the weakly
basic and poorly coordinating anions, tri-
flate and bisulfate,
as counteranions
to
Hg(II). However,
less activation
is ob-
served with the more basic and better co-
ordinating acetate anion (CH3CO21. The
observed lower rate of oxidation of methyl
bisulfate and triflate compared to methane
is also consistent with an electrophilic pro-
cess (ifwe assume that the activation step is
the slowest step in the overall oxidation).
Bisulfate and triflate groups are electron
withdrawing,
and
substitution
of these
groups for a C-H bond of methane would
be expected to retard participation of the
C-H bonds of these substituted species in
electrophilic reactions. Processes involving
free radicals are not considered likely based
on the high selectivity of the reaction.
Another possible mechanism, oxidative ad-
dition
(22)
to produce an intermediate
Hg(IV) species, has been considered but is
deemed unlikely because it would require
participation and disruption of the stable
5d10 filled shell configuration of Hg(II).
Two pieces of evidence have been ob-
tained for the involvement of the activa-
tion step as shown in Scheme 2 to produce
methyl mercuric bisulfate, 1. Direct obser-
vations of crude reaction mixtures by 13C
(and
`99Hg) nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy show that 1 is present
at a low steady-state concentration during
the reaction with methane (Fig. 1). The
use of "C-enriched methane confirms that
this species is produced by reaction with
methane and not by some contaminant.
The identity of intermediate 1 was con-
firmed by comparison to a sample prepared
independently by treatment of dimethyl
mercury with one equivalent of sulfuric acid
(Eq. 6):
Hg(CH3)2 + H2S04 -*
CH3HgOSO3H + CH4
Further evidence that
1
is produced by
methane activation was provided by the
reaction of CH4 with 2H2SO4 in the pres-
ence of Hg(II). Under these conditions,
deuterium incorporation into the CH4 was
observed by GC-MS analyses. This result

two
sets of data provide strong evidence for
the
formation
of
1
by
the
activation
step
proposed in Scheme

not imply that Hg(OSO3H)2
is the species
that
activates
methane.
At

the
identity of this species is unknown. However,
a
likely
candidate
is
the
solvated
cation
[Hg(OSO3H)J+,
which
is produced by

toionization of Hg(OSO3H)2 (23).
The evidence for the involvement of the
functionalization step shown in Scheme 2 is
straightforward and quite compelling. Inde-
pendently

mercuric
bisulfate,
1,
is quite stable in concentrated
sulfuric acid
at room temperature. Howev-

sulfur dioxide,
mercurous
bisulfate,
and
methane
at
a
rate
that
is
consistent
with
the intermediacy
of

in
Scheme
2. The evidence
for the reoxida-
tion
step
shown
in
Scheme
2
is
also
straightforward.
Hot concentrated
sulfuric
acid is a powefful oxidant and was observed
to
rapidly
oxidize
mercurous

to
mercuric
bisulfate
with
the
formation
of
sulfur dioxide.
The
Hg(II)-sulfuric
acid
system
de-
scribed
in
this
report
provides
important
precedent that true catalytic systems can be
developed
for
the selective,,
low-tempera-
ture,
overall oxidation of methane to meth-
anol. A
novel
use
of sulfuric
acid
as
an
effective
oxygen-atom
transfer
reagent
for
methane
oxidation
is
also
demonstrated.
This
work
further
demonstrates
that
the
posttransition metal,
isoelectronic
d10 ions
Hg(II) and Th(III) can be used for selective
oxidation
of
methane.
The
catalytic
342
Hg(I1)-sulfuric acid system is well suited for
study because the key intermediates can be
synthesized and examined under controlled
conditions. Few truly catalytic systems
can
be examined
in such detail. Thus far, the
strong evidence for intermediacy of methyl
mercury species in the activation of meth-
ane adds credibility
to the general supposi-
tion that the electrophilic, metal-mediated
oxidation
of
alkanes
can
occur
through
intermediate alkyl metal species (12). The
information gained from the discovery and
study
of
this
system
should
be
useful
in
guiding the development of more
efficient
systems.

that the low yields are due to reduction of palla-

GC analysis of the gas phase by using Ne as an
internal standard.
21. Reactions were carried out as described in (20)
but with a 1-liter Hastaloy-C reactor and 300 ml of
a 0.1 M solution of Hg(OSO3H)2 in 100% sulfuric
acid. Higher selectivities were achieved at lower
conversions. The selectivity was observed to de-
crease at higher conversions.
22. Oxidative addition of methane to Hg(ll) would be
formally described as involving the formation of
methyl mercury(IV) hydride, (CH3)(H)Hg(IV).
23. An intriguing possibility is that a complex involv-
ing
coordinated
methane
and
solvated
[Hg(OSO3H)]+ might be an intermediate on the
reaction pathway to 1. Such coordinated com-
plexes have been proposed; see R. A. Periana
and R. G. Bergman, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 7332
(1986).

Production of Syngas by Direct
Catalytic Oxidation of Methane
D. A. Hickman* and L. D. Schmidt
The reaction between methane and oxygen over platinum and rhodium surfaces in metal-
coated ceramic monoliths can be made to produce mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide
(greater than 90% selectivity for both) with almost complete conversion of methane and
oxygen at reaction times as short as 10-3 seconds. This process has great promise for
conversion of abundant natural gas into liquid products such as methanol and hydrocar-
bons, which can be easily transported from remote locations. Rhodium was considerably
superior to platinum in producing more H2 and less H20, which can be explained by the
known chemistry and kinetics of reactants, intermediates, and products on these surfaces.
The conventional production of syngas or
of H2 therefore requires at least two reac-
tors,
a steam reformer and shifter, and
excess C02 by-product is necessarily pro-
duced that must be vented. Residence
times in each of these reactors are on the
order of 1
s, so the size of a world-scale
liquid fuel plant is very large.
An alternative method to produce hy-
drocarbons, particularly ethylene, is oxida-
tive coupling (2, 3), in which CH4 and 02
flow over a mixed oxide catalyst which
produces gaseous CH3 radicals that ulti-
mately form ethane and ethylene.
Al-
though this process
is
a topic of active
research, it currently is limited by either
low conversion of CH4 or low selectivity to
hydrocarbon products. Several publications
have also appeared in which CO and H2 are
produced with only CH4 and 02 reactants
(4-9). These
processes
were thought
to
involve first the oxidation of CH4 primarily
to H2O, CO, and CO2 followed by reaction
of CH4 with H20 (reaction 2) and the
water gas shift reaction (reaction 4), giving
fairly long reactor residence times of 0.01 to
1 s. In fact, some H2 may be formed initially
in those experiments by the direct oxida-
tion reaction (5). However, because the
catalyst and reaction conditions
are not
optimized for this reaction, the formation of
syngas by the direct oxidation reaction is
not believed to be the primary route of H2
generation (4-9).
We have produced syngas in nearly a
2:1 ratio by the direct catalytic oxidation
of CH4:
1
CH4 + jO02 -->CO + 2H2
Natural gas is our most abundant, clean,
and easily extractable energy source. How-
ever, most methane (CH4) is in locations
far from consumption sites, and its trans-
portation is expensive as gas and hazardous
as liquid or compressed gas. Therefore, it is
desirable to convert methane into liquid
products for more efficient utilization. The
conventional route to liquid fuel produc-
tion is through a syngas intermediate, a CO
+ H2 mixture, which can then be easily
reacted to form either methanol (CH3OH)
(1) over Cu/ZnO catalysts:
CO + 2H2 -- CH30H
or to hydrocarbons through the Fischer-Ti
sch process (1) over Fe and Ru catalysts:
nCO + 2nH2 -> (CH2)A
Syngas is typically produced by react
CH4 with H2O at -800°C to produce a
mixture of CO, H2, H20, and CO2 in a
process termed steam reforming (l):
CH4 + H2O -C CO, CO2, H2, H20
(3)
The products are then converted into a 2: 1
H2/CO mixture (syngas)
or into a H2 +
CO2
mixture
(hydrogen generation) by
adding excess steam in the water gas shift
reaction (l):
CO + H2O -> CO2 + H2

by using oxygen or air over Pt or Rh surfaces
and feed gases near room temperature in a
single monolith
reactor with extremely
short residence times. This reaction is en-
tirely a surface
process because homoge-
neous reaction in flames requires a combus-
tible reactant mixture and would proceed
by free-radical intermediates, thus generat-
ing very little H2.
It is, of course, very surprising that com-
bustion of CH4 in 02 should produce H2
because: (i) the H2 + 02 reaction is very
