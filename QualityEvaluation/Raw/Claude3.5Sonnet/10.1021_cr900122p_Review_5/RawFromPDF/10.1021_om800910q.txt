Abstract
The neopentylidene-neopentyl complex (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(CH2tBu) (1; (PNP− = N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2) extrudes neopentane in neat fluorobenzene under mild conditions (25 °C) to generate the transient titanium alkylidyne (PNP)Ti≡CtBu (A), which subsequently undergoes regioselective 1,2-CH bond addition of a fluorobenzene across the Ti≡C linkage to generate (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-FC6H4) (2). Kinetic and mechanistic studies suggest that the C−H activation process is pseudo-first-order in titanium, with the α-hydrogen abstraction being the rate-determining step and the post-rate-determining step being the C−H bond activation of fluorobenzene. At 100 °C complex 2 does not equilibrate back to A and the preference for C−H activation in benzene versus fluorobenzene is 2:3, respectively. Compound 1 also reacts readily, and in most cases cleanly, with a series of hydrofluoroarenes (HArF), to form a family of alkylidene-arylfluoride derivatives of the type (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(ArF). Thermolysis of the latter compounds generates the titanium alkylidene-fluoride (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(F) (14) by a β-fluoride elimination, concurrent with formation of o-benzyne. β-Fluoride elimination to yield 14 occurs from 2 under elevated temperatures with kaverage = 4.96(16) × 10−5 s−1 and with activation parameters ΔH⧧ = 29(1) kcal/mol and ΔS⧧ = −3(4) cal/mol·K. It was found that β-fluoride elimination is accelerated when electron-rich groups are adjacent to the fluoride group, thus implying that a positive charge buildup at the arylfluoride ring occurs in the activated complex of 2. The alkylidene derivative (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(CH2SiMe3) (15) also undergoes α-hydrogen abstraction to form the putative (PNP)Ti’≡CSiMe3 (B) at higher temperatures (>70 °C) and dehydrofluorinates the same series of HArF when the reaction mixture is thermolyzed at >100 °C over 72 h to produce o-benzyne products and the fluoride analogue (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(F) (26). Only in the case of the substrate 1,2-F2C6H4 can the kinetic C−H activation product (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(o,m-F2C6H3) be isolated and crystallographically characterized. 1-Fluorohexane and fluorocyclohexane can also be dehydrofluorinated by intermediates A and B. No intermediates are observed, but in the case of 1-fluorohexane, the terminal olefin is spectroscopically identified. The dehydrofluorination of HArF and hydrofluoroalkanes (HAlF) can be made cyclic via the quantitative conversion of the alkylidene-fluorides to 1 and 15, by means of transmetalation with LiCH2XMe3 (X = C and Si), and the reactivity of 1 with halobenzenes is also presented and discussed.

Synopsis
The neopentylidene-neopentyl complex (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(CH2tBu) (1; (PNP− = N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2) can generate the transient titanium alkylidyne (PNP)Ti≡CtBu (A), which subsequently undergoes regioselective 1,2-CH bond addition of a fluorobenzene across the Ti≡C linkage to produce (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-FC6H4) (2). Thermolysis of the latter complex promotes β-fluoride elimination, to extrude o-benzyne, and form the alkylidene-fluoride (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(F) (14). Detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies of both the C−H and C−F activation steps are presented in this work along with a detailed discussion of the reaction profile. Likewise, we also present reactivity studies of compound 1 as well the trimethylsilylalkylidyne precursor (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(CH2SiMe3), with a series of hydrofluoroarenes.
1 Introduction
Activation of the carbon−fluoride σ bond found in hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) represents a major challenge for organometallic chemists due to its resistance to oxidative degradation and overall chemical inertness of the C−F bond. (1) Consequently, once released into the environment, these intrinsic features increase the atmospheric lifetimes of such potentially potent greenhouse gases (300−2000 years). (2) As a result, the removal of these fluoride-containing moieties from our environment and their conversion into more useful commodity byproducts remains an essential topic among chemists. Fluoride removal can be achieved by defluorination, dehydrofluorination, or hydrodefluorination reactions that often rely on the use of reactive transition-metal complexes. (3) Indeed, catalytic C−F bond activation has been reported in a number of cases; however, only a few of these involve the use of homogeneous systems. (4) Of paramount importance in this research is therefore an in-depth understanding of the possible mechanisms involved in the cleavage of C−F bonds as well as the isolation of intermediates along the dehydrofluorination pathway. This is especially true if such a process can be achieved under mild conditions.
Although the C−F aryl σ bond is one of the strongest bonds, the binding affinities of hydrofluoroarenes (HArF) toward organometallic reagents are such that the arene itself becomes more susceptible to nucleophilic attack, rendering the fluoride a better leaving group than one would expect. (1) As such, C−F bond activation has been shown to occur using a number of electron-deficient metal complexes, (2) as well as in an unsaturated Ti(III) center. (5) Although a well-defined mechanism for how these transformations take place is currently uncertain, a variety of mechanisms have been postulated, including electron transfer, homolytic cleavage, oxidative addition, β-fluoride elimination, and nucleophilic, electrophilic, or radical pathways. (1, 5, 6) Unfortunately, given the drastic conditions required to achieve C−F activation, intermediates leading to the breaking of this tough bond have been for the most part only proposed, but not isolated. Indeed, the lack of kinetically stable intermediates in the C−F bond cleavage of vinyl fluoride by Cp*2ScH to form Cp*2ScF has led to the proposal of two separate pathways (eq 1). (7) These pathways could proceed via migratory insertion followed by β-fluoride elimination (pathway A) or by a concerted nucleophilic attack of a hydride on the substrate by means of a σ-bond metathesis (pathway B). (7)
Also of notable mention, the C−F activation of hydrofluoroalkanes (HAlF), which are more harmful to the environment, versus HArF are usually proposed to involve different mechanisms. For example, Jones et al. have suggested a free radical chain mechanism for the C−F bond rupture of HAlF using Cp*2Zr(H)2, resulting in the formation of Cp*2Zr(H)F and the corresponding alkane (eq 2). (8) Complex Cp*2Zr(H)2 is also capable of defluorinating fluorobenzene, but this process appears to proceed via two different but competitive pathways. The first entails direct nucleophilic attack of the hydride on the fluorobenzene ring to make a zwitterion and subsequent fluoride abstraction by zirconium to generate the hydrogenated arene. The second pathway involves ortho C−H activation of the fluorobenzene followed by β-fluoride elimination, and finally insertion of the benzyne into the metal hydride to form Cp*2Zr(C6H5)F (eq 2). (8) Andersen and co-workers reported hydrogen for fluorine exchange for a series of HArF and HAlF reactions using Cp′2CeH (Cp′ = 1,2,4-(Me3C)3C5H2) or its corresponding metallacycle. (9) In some instances the kinetic product resulting from C−H activation could be isolated. (9a), (9c) Despite the variety of proposed mechanisms for defluorination of HFCs, a well-defined early transition metal system that can activate both saturated and unsaturated HFCs, by virtue of a similar dehydrofluorination pathway, to our knowledge has not been discovered.
We recently reported that the transient titanium alkylidyne (PNP)Ti≡CtBu (PNP− = N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2) activated strong C−F bonds of HArF under mild conditions, presumably by means of 1,2-CF bond addition across the Ti≡C multiple bond. (10, 11) Hence, the reaction of C6F6 with the alkylidyne synthon (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(CH2tBu) (1) (PNP− = N[2-P(CHMe2)2-4-methylphenyl]2) represented the first example of intermolecular aryl C−F bond activation promoted by a metal carbon multiple bond. (12) Parallel to this result, we have also shown that the transient titanium alkylidyne can readily activate C−H bonds of HArF (13) to afford C−H bond activation products with the fluoride group being ortho with respect to the Ti−C bond. (13) Herein, we report that the transient titanium alkylidynes (PNP)Ti≡CR (R = tBu, A; SiMe3, B) engage not only in regioselective C−H activation of an extensive list of HArF but also in intramolecular C−F activation pathways, ultimately dehydrofluorinating the formal HArF concurrent with the discharge of an organic byproduct (o-benzyne formation). Aliphatic HFCs can also be dehydrofluorinated under mild conditions, and the nature of the organic product suggests a similar mechanism being operative with respect to HArF dehydrofluorination. The type of HArF has allowed us to isolate both kinetic and thermodynamic products, as well as investigate the mechanism behind the sequential C−H/C−F bond activations. A mechanistic study surrounding the dehydrofluorination of saturated and unsaturated HFCs will be presented and discussed in this work.
2 Results and Discussion
2a. Intermolecular C−H Activation of HArF by a Transient Titanium Neopentylidyne
Previous work in our laboratory had established that complex 1 readily extruded neopentane to generate a transient titanium neopentylidyne A, which then activated the C−H bonds in solvent media to form an alkylidene-alkyl derivative. (10, 11) When the alkylidyne precursor 1 was dissolved in fluorobenzene, C−H activation would take place adjacent to the C−F group. (13) Regioselective C−H activation of HArF has previously been explored. For example, Perutz and co-workers conducted systematic DFT studies on the regioselective C−F over C−H activation of pentafluorobenzene with a Pt(H2PCH2CH2PH2) complex. (14) Likewise, the regioselective activation of the haloaryl C−H bond has been recently described by the groups of Legzdins and Piers. (15) In our case, it was found that FC6H5, 1,2-F2C6H4, and 1,4-F2C6H4 all yielded the alkylidene-fluorophenyl complexes (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-FC6H4) (2), (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,m-F2C6H3) (3), and (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,m′-F2C6H3) (4), respectively, when the HArF was treated with 1 (Scheme 1). (13) The connectivity in 2−4 was clearly evident from multinuclear NMR spectroscopic data in addition to X-ray structural studies. (13) Exploration of the asymmetrical HArF, 1,3-F2C6H4, suggested that only two C−H activation products were generated when the mixture was assayed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. These products were the result of ortho C−H activation with respect to the fluoride groups, namely, the compounds (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,p-F2C6H3) (5a) and (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,o′-F2C6H3) (5b), shown in Scheme 1. On the basis of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, isomer 5a was judged to be the major product. The mixture of 5 could be cocrystallized and exposed C−H activation to be occurring at the least hindered position relative to one of the fluorides, as well as ortho to both fluoride groups (Figure 1, vide infra). Similarly, Legzdins reported that the reaction of Cp*W(NO)(CH2CMe3) with 1,3-F2C6H4 resulted in ortho C−H activation and formation of two isomers. The major product, Cp*W(NO)(CH2CMe3)(o,p-F2C6H3) (84%), was the result of activation of the less hindered site compared to the more sterically hindered minor product, Cp*W(NO)(CH2CMe3)(o,o′-F2C6H3) (16% yield). (15a) In our case as well as Legzdins’, activation of the C−H group meta to F was not observed. For the case of the HArF 1,2,3-F3C6H3 and 1,2,3,4-F4C6H2, C−H activation also yielded a product with the fluoride in the ortho position to form (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,m,p-F3C6H2) (6) and (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,m,m′,p-F4C6H) (7), respectively (Scheme 1). In the formation of complex 7, examination of the reaction mixture revealed another product labeled “X” in minor amounts along with traces of an impurity (vide infra). Intuitively, C−H activation of 1,3,5-F3C6H3 yielded the product (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,o′,p-F3C6H2) (8) when treated with 1 (Scheme 1). Unfortunately, treatment of 1 with 1,2,4,5-F4C6H2 resulted in the formation of (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,o′,m,m′-F4C6H2) (9) and two minor products, one of which was also “X” (Scheme 2). When 1,2,4-F3C6H3 reacted with 1, three alkylidene-arylfluoride isomers were clearly visible from the 13C and 19F NMR spectrum. We propose these isomers to be the compounds (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,p,m′-F3C6H2) (10a), (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,o′,m-F3C6H2) (10b), and (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o,m,m′-F3C6H2) (10c), all of which are depicted in Scheme 1. In the reaction of pentafluorobenzene with 1, a mixture of two products is observed. One of the products is proposed to be the pentafluorophenyl complex (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(F5C6) (11). This mixture slowly decayed over 1 week to yield one compound we denote temporarily as X (vide infra) and which is not the C−H activated material 11 (Scheme 2). This byproduct formed from 1 and F5C6H has the same spectroscopic features as one of the two minor products observed from treating 1 with 1,2,3,4-F4C6H2 and 1,2,4,5-F4C6H2 (vide supra). Therefore, the activation of the C−H group to yield putative compounds 9 and 11 does not proceed cleanly via this pathway. We were able to generate 9 and 11, however, by an independent approach by treatment of the corresponding HArF with nBuLi thawing from −190 °C, thus forming “Li(F5C6)” or “Li(F4C6H)” in situ, followed by addition of (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(OTf) (12). (16) Although the reaction of Li(F5C6) with 12 is clean, treating 12 with “Li(o,o′,m,m′-F4C6H)” resulted in formation of 9 along with another product, which was identified to be the third unidentified minor impurity from the reaction of 1 and 1,2,3,4-F4C6H2 (Scheme 2). We have been unable thus far to identify this minor product. Table 1 compiles spectroscopic data for the alkylidene-arylfluoride derivatives 2−11.

In all cases, and based on our previous mechanistic studies for the C−H activation of benzene, we propose that α-hydrogen abstraction toward the formation of A takes place prior to C−H activation of the HArF (vide infra). (10, 11) Coordination of the HArF to the alkylidyne precursor, 1, is not likely taking place in these sets of reactions since (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(C6H5) (13), a reagent that equilibrates to A at higher temperatures (>90 °C), (10, 11) fails to react with the same list of HArF at room temperature. Therefore, binding of the HArF is not facilitating α-hydrogen abstraction in 1.
Complexes 2−11 all display diagnostic alkylidene resonances in the 13C (281−275 ppm) and 1H NMR (9.2−6.8 ppm) spectra, and the 31P NMR spectroscopic data (two doublets with JP−P = 43−28 Hz) are clearly consistent with pseudo-Cs symmetric systems arising from skewing of the aryl backbone in the PNP ancillary. The solid state structures of compounds 5 (isomers 5a and 5b), (17)6, (18) and 11 have been determined as well (Figure 1), and all systems are comparable to the molecular structures of 2−4. In each case, the Ti═C distances (1.870(5) Å, 5; 1.8659(17) Å, 6) are consistent with these compounds bearing a terminal alkylidene ligand (Figure 1), while the Ti···F distances (2.99(4) Å, 5; 3.03(2) Å, 6) are too long to imply that a rigid coordination or pseudo-cyclometalation is taking place in the solid state. In fact, these distances are much longer when compared to the few structural examples of Ti(IV)-fluoroarene adducts (2.113(7)−2.151(2) Å) such as the cationic titanium imide salt [(nacnac)Ti═NAr(FC6H5)][B(C6F5)4] (nacnac− = [ArNCtBu]2CH, Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) (19) and the titanocene(III) cation [Cp*2Ti(FC6H5)][BPh4]. (20) The crystal structure of 11 differs slightly from 2−6 since it shows a contact between the alkylidene α-H and the o-F of the aryl ring (∼2.45 Å). (22) The Ti═C distance (1.858(5) Å) in 11 is similar to that of 5 and 6 and does not display a titanium fluoride interaction.
2b. C−F Activation Reactions in Titanium Alkylidene-Fluorophenyl Derivatives
Complexes 2−11 are all shown to be kinetic products under an atmosphere of nitrogen since thermolysis at 100 °C over 48 h resulted in the quantitative formation of the neopentylidene-fluoride complex (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(F) (14) (Scheme 3). Production of the latter complex is evident from the 19F NMR spectrum (Ti−F, 166.2 ppm), which is comparable to other alkylidene-fluoride compounds reported by our group. (11) Likewise, the 31P NMR spectrum of 14 reveals 2JP−F (17 Hz) and 2JP−P (55 Hz) values resulting in two doublets of doublets (Table 2). We could not, however, resolve 2JC−F coupling for the alkylidene resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum (314 ppm, JC−H = 103 Hz). The 1H NMR spectrum displayed a downfield singlet at 11.79 ppm for the alkylidene hydrogen. In fact, comparison of the crude 1H and 31P NMR spectra from the reaction of 1,2,3,4-F4C6H2 and pentafluorobenzene with 1 at room temperature reveals complex 14 to be the other product “X” generated in these reactions (vide supra, Schemes 1 and 2).

Table 2. List of Salient NMR Spectroscopic Features (bolded in complex) for Compounds 14, 26, 32, and 33
Given the rarity of terminal alkylidene-fluorides (11, 22) we proceeded to collect solid state structural data for 14. Interestingly, the solid state structure of 14 differed from that of 12 since the α-hydrogen was pointed away from the fluoride ligand (Figure 2). This orientation seemed counterintuitive given the potential formation of a strong hydrogen bond to form a locked alkylidene rotamer. Low-temperature NMR spectral data of 14, collected at −55 °C, did not resolve the alkylidene α-hydrogen to the corresponding rotamers.

Selected bond lengths (Å) and angles (odeg): Ti1−C27 = 1.878(2), Ti1−P1 = 2.5946(7), Ti1−P2 = 2.5815(7), Ti1−N1 = 2.1027(17), Ti1−F1 = 1.812(14), Ti1−C27−C28 = 156.2(3), P1−Ti1−P2 = 150.32(2).
2c. o-Benzyne Trapping and Isotopic Labeling Experiments
Formation of 14 from the neopentylidene-aryl fluorides 2−11 implied that β-fluoride elimination was taking place. To exclude a radical pathway, which has been proposed for d0 zirconocene dihydrides, (8) the organic byproducts generated from the C−F activation were analyzed using a combination of isotopic labeling as well as organic traps. Vacuum transfer of the volatiles from the thermolysis of 2 in C7D8 revealed several organic products generated from C−F bond cleavage. Examination of this solution by GC-MS suggested one product originating from the Diels−Alders addition of o-benzyne to C7D8 (MW = 176 g/mol inferred by GC-MS), as well as the presence of biphenylene (MW = 152 g/mol). Likewise, a significant amount of C6H4D2 (MW = 80 g/mol) was observed, presumably due to benzylic C−D abstraction from the solvent media. Attempts to thermolyze 2 with other traps, such as furan, resulted in complicated mixtures, possibly due to the reactive nature of the alkylidene ligand present in 2. In fact, no 1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalene was observed for the latter reaction when judged by 1H NMR spectra and GC-MS. (23) The use of durene as a trap in the thermolysis of 2 yielded only a small fraction of the cycloaddition product, as indicated by GC-MS (MW = 210 g/mol). Given the ability of o-benzyne to undergo free radical chemistry, potentially resulting in unwanted pathways including the formation of biphenylene or triphenylene side products, (24-26) we resorted to generating o-tetrafluorobenzyne. This reagent is inclined to show more controllable dienophile chemistry as opposed to secondary radical pathways. (27) Accordingly, thermolysis of 11 in durene at 100 °C over 7 days resulted in the clean formation of 14 concurrent with production of the [6+2]-cycloaddition product 5,6,7,8-tetrafluoro-1,4-dihydro-2,3,9,10-tetramethyl-1,4-ethenonaphthalene depicted in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4. Formation of 14 and o-Benzyne Trapping by Thermolysis of 11 in Neat Durene
Formation of the latter organic product was confirmed via a combination of GC-MS and 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy. (9, 26, 27) Therefore, this work unambiguously confirms that C−F activation in precursors 2−11 must be transpiring through a β-fluoride elimination pathway concomitant with o-benzyne extrusion.
2d. Dehydrofluorination of HFCs by C−H and C−F Activation Reactions Involving a Transient Titanium Trimethylsilylmethylidyne
Complex 1 undergoes α-hydrogen abstraction much more readily than the trimethylsilylmethylidene-trimethysilylmethyl derivative (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(CH2SiMe3) (15), but the latter complex is also a synthon to the alkylidyne analogue intermediate B, albeit at higher temperatures. (10, 11) Consequently, treatment of 15 with all of the HArF substrates (discussed previously with 1) at room temperature resulted in no reaction. Only upon heating (>60 °C) was there a noticeable transformation, toward a mixture of the corresponding fluoroaryl-alkylidene derivatives (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(ArF) (ArF = o-FC6H4 (16), o,m-F2C6H3 (17), o,p-F2C6H3 (18), o,o′-F2C6H3 (19), o,m,p-F3C6H2 (20), o,m,m′,p-F4C6H (21), o,o′,p-F3C6H2 (22), o,o′,m,m′-F4C6H (23), o,p,m′-F3C6H2 (24a) and isomers o,o′,m-F3C6H2 (24b) and o,m,m′-F3C6H2 (24c), and F5C6 (25)), and the fluoride (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(F) (26). In some instances, starting material was also present in the reaction mixture (Scheme 5). Table 1 compiles salient spectroscopic features for the trimethylsilylmethylidene-ArF derivatives, while Table 2 provides some spectroscopic signatures for 26. Analogous to 14, complex 26 displayed a diagnostic 19F NMR spectroscopic resonance at 165.2 ppm, while the 31P NMR spectrum evinced two doublets of doublets arising from 2JP−F coupling with the inequivalent phosphine arms of the bound PNP ligand (Table 2). As observed for 1, formation of 26 from 15 and the HArF likely proceeds via an intermolecular C−H activation step followed by β-fluoride elimination, concurrent with formation of o-benzyne or fluoro- o-benzyne derivatives.

Scheme 5. Reactivity of 15 with Fluoroarenes at >100 °C to Form 26 and Organic Byproducts (benzyne byproducts not shown) or at 60 °C to Form (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(ArF) and 26 as a Mixture
In general, the reactions are slow, and complete decay of 15 is observed only after extensive periods of time at 60 °C (∼3 weeks). Unfortunately, the extended periods of time resulted in partial decomposition to a mixture of products, which included (PNP)H as well as other metal-based materials when judged by 31P NMR spectroscopy. This feature is not surprising given that 15 itself has a limited half-life in C6H6 (∼3 h at >60 °C). (10, 11) Therefore, formation of 26 from 15 and the corresponding HArF can be expedited to ∼72 h by thermolysis of 15 at >100 °C. Under these conditions, no kinetic products are observed in the reaction mixture. Only in one case were we fortunate enough to crystallize the kinetic product, (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(o,m-F2C6H3) (17), from the reaction of 15 with 1,2-F2C6H4 at 60 °C over 3 weeks. Upon isolation, complex 17 does indeed transform to 26 under thermolytic conditions at 100 °C over 48 h, further endorsing the hypothesis that C−H activation of the HArF is the first step along the dehydrofluorination sequence. In the formation of complexes 21, 23, and 25, the reactions are not clean, and the 31P NMR spectra displayed three products, those of C−H and C−F activation as well as another unknown impurity that we have been unable to identify thus far.
To unambiguously confirm the connectivity in 17, single-crystal X-ray diffraction data was collected. As depicted in Figure 3, the solid state structure of 17 portrays a rare example of a distorted and terminal trimethylsilylmethylidene complex (Ti═C, 1.859(3) Å, Ti═C−Si 157.7(2)o) (10, 11, 16, 28) in addition to a difluorophenyl ligand. Analogous to 3, the fluoride groups on the ring are ortho and meta with respect to the C−H activation site, and the phenyl ring is oriented in the C═Ti−Caryl plane. As noted in the mono-, di-, and trifluorophenyl derivatives 2, 5, and 6, the Ti···F distance (3.268(2) Å) is too long to suggest the presence of a strong interaction in the solid state. Similar to the solid state structure of 3, complex 17 has the alkylidene trimethylsilyl methylidene hydrogen oriented away from the ArF groups (Figure 3).

2e. Dehydrofluorination of Fluoroalkanes by Complexes 1 and 15
HArF are not the only substrates amenable to dehydrofluorination since complex 1 also gradually transforms to 14 quantitatively in the presence of 1-fluorohexane (FC6H13) at 25 °C over 12 h (Scheme 6). Examination of the volatiles by GC-MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy reveals formation of the olefin 1-hexene. This result further supports the notion that C−H activation and β-fluoride elimination are taking place along the dehydrofluorination pathway of the fluoroalkane. The GC-MS also yielded traces of other organic products that we are currently attempting to identify. The formation of the terminal olefin in the reaction of 1 with 1-fluorohexane implies that C−H activation at the 2-position of the fluoroalkane is likely occurring to form a transient titanium alkylidene-fluoroalkyl, which then undergoes β-fluoride elimination to form 14 (Scheme 6). We cannot refute, however, the possibility of C−H activation taking place away from the fluoride group and the system undergoing “chain walking” to ultimately produce the titanium-fluoride product. (29) Jordan and co-workers have reported similar halide elimination reactions when attempting to polymerize and copolymerize polar monomers such as vinyl ethers and halides. (30) Isotopic labeling studies using (PNP)Ti═CDtBu(CD2tBu) (1) -d3 and 1-fluorohexane reveal that the alkylidyne intermediate A is generated in this reaction, since the α-hydrogen in 14 is not isotopically enriched (based on the 1H and 2H NMR spectra). Interestingly, a competition experiment between 1 and a 1:1 mixture of fluorohexane and fluorobenzene revealed a slight preference for C−H/C−F activation of fluorohexane over fluorobenzene (58% to 42%, respectively).
Scheme 6
Scheme 6. Dehydrofluorination of 1-Fluorohexane Using Precursors 1 and 15
Jones and co-workers have proposed divergent pathways taking place for the hydrodefluorination of HArF versus that for HAlF. For example, the possibility of β-fluoride elimination, by virtue of a benzyne intermediate Cp*2Zr(H)(F)(η2-C6H4), has been invoked as a likely pathway for the isomerization of Cp*2Zr(H)(o-FC6H4) to the fluoride complex Cp*2Zr(F)(C6H5), while a radical chain mechanism involving a putative Zr(III) species Cp*2Zr(H) has been suggested in the hydrodefluorination of HAlF (eq 2). (8) In our case, the dehydrofluorination mechanism appears to be common for both HArF and HAlF, presumably due to the propensity of intermediate A to first activate the C−H bond of the substrate.
Likewise, complex 15 also promotes the dehydrofluorination of 1-fluorohexane at >60 °C to yield 26 and 1-hexene. As with 1, traces of some unidentified organic species are observed in the reaction of 15 with the terminal HAlF when the volatiles are analyzed by GC-MS (Scheme 6). The reaction of 1 or 15 with fluorocyclohexane also resulted in some formation of 14 and 26, respectively. However, other titanium-based products were observed via 31P NMR spectroscopy, and the organic byproduct could not be conclusively scrutinized.
2f. Mechanistic Studies of the Regioselective C−H Activation of HArF by 1
The ability to isolate both kinetic and thermodynamic products from the dehydrofluorination reaction of HArF using 1 as our reagent allowed both the C−H and C−F activation steps to be investigated independently. Accordingly, kinetic parameters for the conversion of 1 → 2 were assessed experimentally by monitoring the decay of 1 using 31P NMR spectroscopy in FC6H5 and revealed a kaverage = 5.896(5) × 10−5 s−1 at 25 °C. As anticipated for a C−H activation reaction by a transient Ti≡CtBu linkage in A, (10, 11) the conversion was found to obey pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to titanium, which is in excellent agreement with the reaction energy profile suggested by our earlier experiments and DFT calculations reported for the C−H activation of benzene. (10, 11) Not surprisingly, under a depleted amount of fluorobenzene, formation of 2 is not clean, given the ability of intermediate A to react with both the arene and other media, such as benzene, cyclohexane, hexane, 1-fluorohexane, fluorocyclohexane, and pentane. In fact, competition experiments of 1 with FC6H5 and C6H6 (1:1) consistently produced a 60:40 mixture of 2 and 13, respectively. This result implies that the preference of one product over the other may be slightly influenced by a binding event of the fluoro group inasmuch as a positive polarization at the ortho hydrogen by an inductive effect. In fact, we speculate that the regioselective activation of the C−H bond in the HArF is dominated by a combination of sterics, the binding affinity of the fluoro group to the Ti, and incipient positive charge at the o-carbon promoted by the fluoro group (vide infra).
Competition experiments between FC6H5 and 1,3,5-F3C6H3 (55% to 45%) as well as 1,3,5-F3C6H3 and C6H6 (51% to 49%) do not show any preference for C−H activation of one substrate over the other, hence suggesting that there is a fine line between electronic and thermodynamic preference. Clearly, a binding event is not accelerating C−H activation of the HArF. This feature is further corroborated by the fact that treatment of 1 with anisole results solely in ortho C−H activation with respect to the OCH3 group to form (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-CH3OC6H4) (27) (11) after 1 day at 25 °C. The rate for the conversion of 1 to 27 (4.26 × 10−5 s−1) is similar to that of the conversion of 1 → 2 and is in agreement with the rate-determining step likely being formation of A. This result also implies that binding of the fluoride group, if any, does not have a significant effect on the rate. If 1 is treated with 2-fluoroanisole, we observe exclusive activation of the C−H bond ortho to the fluoro group to form the compound (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-F,m-CH3OC6H3) (28) (kaverage = 1.71(7) × 10−4 s−1), depicted in Scheme 8. (13) The latter result also suggests that the fluoro group must enhance positive polarization on the ortho-hydrogen as opposed to the ether site being a better donor. Preference for C−H activation adjacent to the fluoro substituent is also observed when 1 is dissolved in 4-fluoroanisole to yield a 3:1 mixture of regioisomers (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-F,m′-CH3OC6H3) and (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-CH3O,m′-FC6H3), respectively. (13) On the basis of all of our comparative studies, we cannot disregard the possibility of A activating a distant C−H bond in a substrate such as FC6H5 and then undergoing ring-walking, (9a) via α-hydrogen abstraction steps, (15a) to ultimately afford the final product 2 (Scheme 8). This is not unreasonable to propose since Legzdins reported the meta and para intermediates to be kinetic products preceeding the ortho C−H bond activation of chlorobenzene. (15a) To further elucidate whether or not ring-walking could be taking place in the C−H activation pathway leading to ortho-selectivity, complex (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(p-FC6H4) (29) was synthesized independently, in 90% yield, from 12 and 1 equiv of Mg(p-FC6H4)2 (Scheme 7). Upon heating 29 for 18 h at 110 °C in C6D6, the formation of complex 14 was evident in the 31P NMR spectrum. However, only at high temperature does complex 29 form 14, therefore implying that fluorobenzene must be first eliminated to form transient A, followed by ring-walking to ultimately produce 14 (Scheme 7). Since the thermolysis is conducted in benzene, we cannot argue against C−H activation of the media (i.e., C6D6) occurring under these conditions. Monitoring the thermolysis of 29 in C6D6 does not reveal formation of 13. In fact, low-temperature 31P and 19F NMR spectroscopic data (10 °C) collected on a sample of 1, after immediately dissolving in FC6H5, do not reveal other product(s), apart from 2 being generated in the reaction mixture. However, one would argue against the proposal of ring-walking since the barrier to equilibration to A should be comparable to, if not higher than, the barrier predicted and experimentally assessed for the 13 ↔ A equilibration (∼30.1 kcal/mol at 298.15 K). (13)

Scheme 8. Synthesis of Compounds 2, 3, 28, 30, and 31 from Regioselective C−H Activation Using 1 and Subsequent Thermolysis at 100 °C to Afford 14 and Substituted o-Benzyne
Temperature dependence studies of the 1 → 2 transformation between 10 and 40 °C allowed for extraction of the activation parameters from the Eyring plot: ΔH⧧ = 21(1) kcal/mol and ΔS⧧ = −7(3) cal/molK−1, yielding a ∼ΔG⧧ = 23 kcal/mol at 298.15 K (Figure 4). Not surprisingly, our activation parameters are similar to previously reported experimental values obtained for the C−H activation of benzene (ΔH⧧ = 24(7), ΔS⧧ = −2(3) cal/mol K−1, ∼ΔG⧧ = 24.7 kcal/mol), which suggested that a similar reaction coordinate is operative here. (11) These parameters are also in reasonable agreement with the DFT prediction of 27.8 kcal/mol for the rate-determining step along the C−H activation of benzene. (10, 11) The intermolecular kH/kD ratio is remarkably close to unity (1.01(17) at 25 °C) when substituting FC6D5 for FC6H5, suggesting that the overall rate of the reaction has minor contributions from the C−H bond activation of the HArF. (27) As anticipated for an α-hydrogen abstraction being the rate-determining step to yield intermediate A, the rates for the decay of 1 and 1-d3 are substantially different, thus yielding a kH/kD ratio of 4.04(7) at 25 °C. This result also discards an associative mechanism, whereby 1 binds the fluorobenzene substrate, given the similarities of the KIEs between benzene and fluorobenzene. Our smaller difference in KIE versus Wolczanki’s systems (KIE = 5−14) (31) might be rationalized on the basis of a more asymmetric H+ transfer from the Calkylidene to the Calkyl group in 1, consistent with our proposed and more acute four-centered transition state leading to A. This feature is analogous to the transition state computed along the activation of a benzene C−H bond. (11) The meridional constraint imposed by the PNP ancillary could be enforcing a more distorted H+ migration to the departing neopentyl group. The data therefore provide strong credence to the rate-determining step being the α-hydrogen abstraction to generate a transient titanium alkylidyne intermediate A. On this basis, one would expect the C−H activation step not to contribute significantly to the KIE values obtained at 25 °C.

2g. Mechanistic Studies of the C−F Bond Activation of Fluorobenzene via the Kinetic Product 2
As noted earlier, our ability to cleanly isolate most of the C−H activation kinetic products derived from 1 and the corresponding HArF (vide supra) allowed for mechanistic studies on the C−F activation step leading to formation of 14. Concentration dependence studies on the thermolysis of 2 (0.078, 0.156, and 0.234 mM solutions in toluene) suggests an intramolecular C−F activation pathway since the rate (kaverage = 4.9(3) × 10−5 s−1) does not change significantly at 100 °C. As a result, the C−F activation reaction derived from 2, and leading to 14, was found to obey first-order kinetics with respect to titanium. The conversion of 2 → 14 was assessed experimentally by monitoring the decay of 2 using 31P NMR spectroscopy in a C7H8 solution to reveal a kaverage = 4.96(16) × 10−5 s−1 at 100 °C. Likewise, the rate of the reaction does not deviate when thermolysis of 2 is conducted in other nonpolar aprotic solvents such as benzene or methylcyclohexane. Unfortunately, monitoring the reaction in a polar aprotic solvent such as THF, pyridine, or 2,6-lutidine resulted in a myriad of products.
Extraction of the activation parameters from the Eyring plot (85−115 °C) revealed ΔH⧧ = 29(1) kcal/mol and ΔS⧧ = −3(4) cal/mol K−1, yielding a ∼ΔG⧧ = 30 kcal/mol at 298.15 K (Figure 5). From our entropy value there is no clear evidence for less or more ordering in the transition state. This result can, however, be rationalized in terms of an “early” transition state being formed with respect to formation of 14 where there is some Ti···F interaction concomitant with weakening of the Ti−CarylF bond. Unfortunately, the high barrier ∼ΔG⧧ of 30 kcal/mol for this reaction argues against this hypothesis and favors a “late” transition state given the energy penalty in generating a reactive species such as o-benzyne. In other words, the C−F bond should be nearly broken and the leaving o-benzyne nearly formed in the activated complex. For the activated complex of 2, the constrained geometry is most likely due to the Ti···F interaction. The plausibility of intermolecular interactions (such as H···F) seems dubious to propose given the steric constraint offered by the aryl, alkylidene, and PNP ancillaries. The solid state structure of 14 also argues against this possibility given that there is not even a weak intermolecular H···F interaction. Likewise, our concentration dependence studies veto this possibility, because the rate did not fluctuate significantly under those conditions (vide supra). Therefore, we speculate that the activated complex must have significant Ti···F bond formation concurrent with Ti−CarylF weakening en route to extrusion of the o-benzyne.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Eyring plot for the 2 → 14 transformation in toluene.
Fortunately, our ability to selectively activate the C−H group ortho to the fluoride in substrates such as 1,2-F2C6H4 and 2-F-anisole, to form 3 and 28, respectively, provided the premise to vary the H in complex 2 to other substituents. Accordingly, treating 1 with other ortho-substituted HArF, such as 2-fluorotoluene and fluorobenzotrifluoride, resulted in selective C−H activation ortho with respect to the fluoride, to furnish the aryl derivatives (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-F,m-CH3C6H3) (30) and (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-F,m-CF3C6H3) (31), respectively (Scheme 8). An attempt to selectively activate the C−H bond in substrates such as 1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene or 1-chloro-2-fluorobenzene was unsuccessful.
Table 3 summarizes the rate constants measured at 100 °C for the transformation of 2, 3, 28, 30, and 31 to product 14 and the corresponding organic byproduct most likely generated from o-benzyne degradation (Scheme 8). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a linear, free-energy relationship observed from the Hammett correlation using the substituent constants σm (meta-substituent constants, see Supporting Information). (32) For clarity, our meta-substituent constant corresponds to the X substituent with respect to the Ti−Caryl bond. From our rate constants, however, it can be inferred that the more electron-donating substituent (i.e., CH3) resulted in a faster C−F cleavage rate, while the more electron-withdrawing (i.e., OCH3, F, CF3) slowed the rate of β-fluoride elimination. The sterics (provided by X) do not appear to be playing a significantly large role in this type of transformation since the rate for C−F activation of 4 to 14 (kaverage = 1.38(13) × 10−5 s−1) is not significantly different from the conversion of 3 to 14 (kaverage = 1.1(5) × 10−5 s−1). The slowing of the rate inflicted by the electron with drawing substituent X implies a positive charge buildup at the arylfluoride moiety for the activated complex 2-TS.

Previous work had demonstrated that complex 13 can slowly equilibrate back to intermediate A with a kaverage = 1.2(2) × 10−5 s−1 at 95 °C, and activation parameters ΔH⧧ = 31(16) kcal/mol and ΔS⧧ = 3(9) cal/molK−1 (ΔG⧧ value of ∼30.1 kcal/mol at 298.15 K). (11) Since C−F activation in intermediates such as 2−11 generally occurs at temperatures above 90 °C, we inquired whether a pre-equilibrium step, to form an intermediate such as A, preceded β-fluoride elimination. In accordance with Scheme 10, thermolysis of 13 in FC6D5 at 100 °C does yield (PNP)Ti═CDtBu(F) (14)-d1, thus consistent with sequential C−H and C−F bond activation reactions involving intermediates A and 2-d5, respectively. This also supports the notion that the barrier leading to A should at least approach or exceed the barrier to formation of 14 from 2 (≥30.1 kcal/mol at 298.15 K, vide supra). By increasing the α-hydrogen abstraction barrier, β-fluoride elimination is then overcome in the case of the alkylidyne synthon, 13, thus preventing the isolation of an intermediate such as 2. To address if 2 converts back to A by an α-hydrogen abstraction and under the conditions leading to C−F activation, complex 2-d5 was independently prepared from 1 and FC6D5 and subsequently thermolyzed in FC6H5 at 100 °C over 7 days. No proton incorporation into the α-alkylidene carbon of the product 14-d1 (formed quantitatively) was observed when judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy, hence implying that 2 does not pre-equilibrate to A under those conditions (Scheme 9). Therefore, the barrier for β-fluoride elimination must be lower than the α-hydrogen abstraction barrier in the reverse direction, 2 → A. Despite us not knowing a relative ground state energy for 2 (with respect to 1), our experimental data suggest that the reverse barrier, 2 → A, must be well above ∼30 kcal/mol.

Scheme 10. Cyclic Dehydrofluorination of Fluorobenzene Applying Precursor 1 and FC6H5 as the Model Reagent
To further elucidate the role of the fluoride in the bond-breaking event, the thermolysis of 27 was explored with the idea of promoting a β-methoxide elimination. (33, 34) Complex 27 is conveniently prepared via treatment of 1 with neat anisole (videsupra), (13) but heating solutions of 27 at 90 °C over 48 h in toluene resulted in a myriad of unidentifiable products. Therefore, the fluoride group is essential in promoting the β-elimination step in these types of systems.
2h. Cyclic Dehydrofluorination of Fluorobenzene
Complex 14 or 26 can be readily converted back to 1 and 15 in 88% or 70% isolated yield, respectively, by transmetalation with LiCH2tBu (35) or LiCH2SiMe3, to formally close the cycle for the dehydrofluorination of HArF and HAlF. Given that formation of 14 and 26 is virtually quantitative for HArF and HAlF, the overall yield for the recycling of titanium essentially depends on the last step of the cycle. Since the latter reaction is also quantitative by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, the cycle for dehydrofluorination is quantitative overall. Scheme 10 displays the cycle for dehydrofluorination of HFCs using precursor 1 and fluorobenzene as our model substrate. As established from this work, the formation of intermediate A from 1 is rate-determining along the C−H activation of fluorobenzene to form the kinetic product 2. Thermolysis of 2 resulted in Ti−F bond formation concomitant with formation of benzyne and 14. The use of durene as a trap along the formation of 14 from 2 is not imperative, given the ability of benzyne to undergo other decomposition pathways that do not appear to involve the degradation of 2 or 14. (24-26)
The propensity of complex 1 to dehydrofluorinate substrates such as HArF and HAlF in a stepwise fashion, and under relatively mild conditions, led us to examine the possibility of carrying out catalytic reactions using an excess of an alkylating reagent in the presence of 1 and fluorobenzene at 100 °C. Unfortunately, the tendency of nucleophiles such as Zn(CH2tBu)2, (35) Mg(CH2tBu)2, (35) ClMg(CH2tBu), and LiCH2tBu (35) to react preferentially with fluorobenzene over 14 (or not react with 14 at all) under these conditions has prevented the use of 1 as a dehydrofluorination catalyst. In fact, an attempt to replace the fluoride in 14 with a hydride, by using neat Et3SiH, did not result in a reaction, even under forcing conditions (>75 °C over 72 h). Likewise, the catalytic dehydrofluorination of HAlF is also unlikely since independent treatment of compound 1 with terminal olefins (a byproduct from the dehydrofluorination of HAlF) resulted in a mixture of products, which we have been unable to characterize.
2i. Reactivity of Complex 1 with Haloarene Derivatives
Treatment of 1 or 15 with other haloarenes, such as PhX (X = Cl and Br), resulted in complicated mixtures when assayed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. To assess whether putative products such as (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(Cl) (32) or (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(Br) (33) were formed in these mixtures, they were prepared independently using salt metathesis of 12 with excess MgX2 (X = Cl and Br) in THF. Accordingly, treatment of 12 with MgX2 cleanly produced the halide derivatives 32 and 33 in 68% and 88% yield, respectively (Scheme 11). Table 2 displays salient spectroscopic features for these two complexes. Unlike the alkylidene precursor reported by Legzdins and co-workers, Cp*W(NO)(CH2tBu)2, (15a) we were unable to isolate any aryl C−H activated products from the reaction of PhX (X = Cl and Br) with 1. Although a myriad of products are observed, formation of 32 and 33 is evident, albeit in low concentrations, when judged by 31P NMR spectroscopy and in comparison with independently prepared samples (vide supra). This result suggests some formation of an alkylidene-arylhalide such as (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(o-XC6H4), although other explanations are possible (Scheme 11). Our capacity to generate and crystallize the alkylidene-halide derivatives 32 and 33 allowed us to closely study the orientation of the neopentylidene α-hydrogen. As depicted in Figure 3, the alkylidene hydrogen is pointing away from the Cl or Br ligand. Analogously to 14, no H-bonding or striking differences are observed in 32 and 33.

2j. Proposed Overall Reaction Coordinate for Sequential C−H and C−F Activation
Theoretical studies reported earlier for the C−H activation of arenes by a transient titanium alkylidyne, (10, 11) as well as kinetic analysis described in this work, clearly support the idea of compound 1 undergoing an initial α-hydrogen abstraction, with this step being overall rate-determining (ΔGC-HAlkane⧧) in the C−H activation sequence to produce 2. Such an event likely occurs by the alkane adduct (PNP)Ti≡CtBu(CH3tBu) (A-CH3tBu), eventually undergoing entropy-assisted loss of CH3tBu to yield the transient and reactive alkylidyne A (Figure 6). As observed in the benzene C−H activation reaction coordinate, theoretical studies suggest that 1-TS should be representative of a “late” transition state (CH3tBu nearly formed at 1-TS) with respect to formation of A. (11) Our kinetic studies involving the C−H activation of fluorobenzene suggest a similar pathway along formation of A. In the case presented here, the fluorinated substrate (i.e., FC6H5) would bind to the four-coordinate Lewis acidic titanium center to generate the F-coordinated fluorobenzene adduct (PNP)Ti≡CtBu(FC6H5) (A-ArylF, F-bound). (13) Binding of the HArF should not stabilize the (PNP)Ti≡CtBu scaffold significantly, since coordination of a much stronger Lewis base such as pyridine has been computed to be virtually barrierless and not exceedingly exergonic with respect to A. (36) Therefore, A and A-ArylF (F-bound) should be virtually isothermal. Our speculation is further corroborated by the minor selectivity of A toward the C−H bond of FC6H5 versus C6H6, to form 2 versus 13 in a 3:2 ratio, respectively (vide supra). Likewise, we do not observe any significant preference in the dehydrofluorination competition reaction of 1 with 1-fluorohexane versus FC6H5. Putative A-ArylF (F-bound), however, does not necessarily have to lie along the reaction coordinate to 2. In addition, a similar C−H bond rupture selectivity is observed in anisole, thus supporting the idea of formation of an adduct along the C−H activation sequence. Whether intermediate A-ArylF (F-bound) undergoes rearrangement to a C−H bound σ-adduct or a π-complex is uncertain at this point. Regardless, rearrangement of A-ArylF (F-bound) to the ArylF, A-ArylF (CH-adduct), has an energy penalty ΔGC-HArylF⧧ that most likely arises from an entropic component as well as a steric constraint in the F-bound versus the more sterically crowded CH-bound hydrofluoroarene adduct (Figure 6). As noted in the C−H activation of benzene, intermediate A-ArylF (CH-adduct) should possess an “early” transition state (with the hydrofluoroaryl C−H bond essentially not broken, A-ArylF-TS) with respect to formation of 2. However, in Figure 6 we are speculating that ΔGC-HArylF⧧ (FC6H5 binding to A) is rate-determining along the C−H bond breaking step. Synthesis of o-d1-fluorobenzene and intramolecular KIE measurements could give us some insight into this mechanistic feature; however, we have been unable to obtain interpretable data from these experiments. (37) The preference for the activation of the HArF versus the aliphatic C−H bond (from CH3tBu) is clearly reflected by the asymmetry in the reaction profile, ΔΔG1⧧. The reverse reaction, formation of HArF and A or A-ArylF from precursor 2, is thermodynamically inaccessible due to the high barrier ΔGC-HArylF associated with this process. Intuitively, the barrier ΔGC-HArylF from 2 must be greater than ΔGC−F⧧ since 2 does not equilibrate with A or adduct A-ArylF under forcing conditions. Therefore, arylfluoride ring-walking via intermediate A (or adduct) is unlikely given the high barrier, ΔGC-HArylF, that complex 2 needs to overcome. Although we have experimentally demonstrated that ring-walking is feasible at temperatures > 100 °C, this pathway seems irrelevant to the mild conditions applied for the 1 → 2 transformation. Therefore, complex 2 must be the only regioisomer produced, and intramolecular C−F activation results in formation of 14 and o-benzyne. Traversing the high barrier ΔGC−F⧧ to produce 14 and o-benzyne is compensated by formation of the strong Ti−F bond, thus placing compound 14 exceedingly lower in energy than 2 and even further below precursor 1. As indicated in Figure 6, complex 2 β-fluoride eliminates, mostly likely concertedly via 2-TS. Our experimental data suggest the presence of a significant Ti−F interaction and positive charge buildup at the ArF ring of 2-TS, thus consistent with a late-activated complex with respect to formation of 14 (refer to Table 1 and Scheme 8). The idea of a benzyne intermediate, (PNP)Ti═CHtBu(F)(η2-C6H4), being generated along formation of 14 is unlikely for two reasons. First, one would expect reactivity of this dienophile with the adjacent alkylidene motif. Second, the coordinatively saturated environment about the Ti(IV) center is unlikely, especially with the sterically imposing PNP and neopentylidene ancillaries.

Replacing tBu with SiMe3 in precursor 1, namely, complex 15, brings about significant consequences to the reaction profile displayed in Figure 6. One clear illustration to this effect is that ΔΔG2⧧ must be greater for the dehydrofluorination reaction of HArF by 15. In fact, this barrier is much greater than in 1 to the extent that ΔΔG2⧧ overcomes ΔGC-HArylF⧧ with respect to A or its F-bound hydrofluoroarene adduct. Such a contrast is primarily due to the greater ΔGC-HAlkane⧧ needed when traversing from 15 to transient alkylidyne B, hence preventing kinetic products such as 16−25 from being cleanly isolated under milder conditions (i.e., 60 °C).
3 Conclusions
Although dehydrofluorination has occurred via a number of metal complexes, a well-defined early transition metal system that could activate both HArF and HAlF by a similar mechanism was previously not known. We were able to discern the mechanistic pathway, since the isolable intermediates can be characterized and studied for the subsequent step: β-fluoride elimination. Under this premise, we have illustrated that the transient titanium alkylidynes A and B participate in stepwise C−H/C−F bond activation to form the titanium fluoride complexes 14 and 26 under relatively mild conditions. Compound 1 selectively activates the ortho C−H bond to the fluorine moiety in an array of HArF to produce a series of alkylidene-fluoroaryl complexes 2−11. Compounds 2−11 are all kinetic products in the overall dehydrofluorination pathway since their thermolysis results in the formation of the alkylidene-fluoride 14 via β-fluoride elimination and formation of benzyne. Trapping of the organic byproduct, benzyne, was achieved by heating 11 in neat durene at 100 °C to form the [6+2]-cycloaddition product 5,6,7,8-tetrafluoro-1,4-dihydro-2,3,9,10-tetramethyl-1,4-ethenonaphthalene. Another titanium alkylidene derivative, 15, dehydrofluorinated the same series of HArF at higher temperatures to produce the alkylidene-fluoride complex 26, also via C−H bond activation and intramolecular C−F bond cleavage. Of great importance was the dehydrofluorination of 1-fluorohexane by complexes 1 and 15 to produce 1-hexene and 14 and 26, respectively. Isolation of the organic byproduct, 1-hexene, allowed us to propose the same dehydrofluorination pathway for both the HArF and HAlF: 1,2-CH bond addition followed by β-fluoride elimination.

General Procedures
Unless otherwise stated, all operations were performed in a M. Braun Laboratory Master double-drybox under an atmosphere of purified nitrogen or using high-vacuum standard Schlenk techniques under an argon atmosphere. Anhydrous n-hexane, pentane, toluene, and benzene were purchased from Aldrich in Sure-Seal reservoirs (18 L) and dried by passage through two columns of activated alumina and a Q-5 column. Diethyl ether was dried by passage through a column of activated alumina. THF was distilled, under nitrogen, from purple sodium benzophenone ketyl and stored under sodium metal. Distilled THF was transferred under vacuum into bombs before being pumped into a drybox. HArF and HAlF were dried via addition of CaH2 and stirring for 3 days; more CaH2 was added and stirred for one more day. The HArF and HAlF were vacuum transferred under inert atmosphere. The solvent was then passed through a column of alumina to obtain dry HArF and HAlF. C6D6 was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory (CIL), degassed, and transferred to 4 Å molecular sieves. Celite, alumina, and 4 Å molecular sieves were activated under vacuum overnight at 200 °C.

Analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum and GC-MS verified the formation of 1-hexene. 1H NMR (23 °C, 399.8 MHz, C6D12): 5.75 (m, 1H, CH2═CHCH2CH2CH2CH3), 4.97 (m, 2H, CH2═CHCH2CH2CH2CH3), 1.96 (m, 2H, CH2═CHCH2CH2CH2CH3), 1.44 (m, 4H, CH2═CHCH2CH2C H2CH3), 0.98 (t, 1H, CH2═CHCH2CH2CH2CH3). MS-GC: theoretical, 84; found, 84.
Preparation of (PNP)Ti═CHSiMe3(F) (16) from 1-Fluorohexane and 15
In a J. Young tube was dissolved 15 [200 mg, 0.307 mmol] in neat 1-fluorohexane (∼0.5 mL, excess) at room temperature. The solution was heated at 100 °C for 5 h, changing from green to red. The solution was extracted with pentane (10 mL) and dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in pentane and filtered through a bed of Celite. The red filtrate was reduced in volume (2 mL) under reduced pressure to give a red solid [146 mg, 0.251 mmmol, 78% yield]. The multinuclear NMR spectra gave the corresponding resonances to 16.
Isolation of 1-Hexene
In a J. Young tube was dissolved 15 [200 mg, 0.307 mmol] in deuterated cyclohexane (∼0.5 mL) at room temperature, and to this was added three drops of 1-fluorohexane. The solution was heated to 100 °C for 5 h. The solution changed from green to red, and the volatiles were vacuum transferred. Analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum and GC-MS verified the formation of 1-hexene.
Recycling of 14 to 1
In a vial 14 [100 mg, 0.177 mmol] was dissolved in pentane (5 mL) and cooled to −35 °C. To this was added an analogous cold solution containing LiCH2tBu [14 mg, 0.179 mmol] in pentane (5 mL). After 30 min the green suspension was filtered, then concentrated in vacuo (∼1 mL) and placed in the freezer to obtain pure 1 as green crystals [91 mg, 0.147 mmol, 83%]. The reaction is quantitative by 31P NMR spectroscopy and matches the spectroscopic details for the previously published 1.
Recycling of 26 to 15
In a vial 26 [100 mg, 0.172 mmol] was dissolved in pentane (5 mL) and cooled to −35 °C. To this was added a cold solution of an analogous cold solution containing LiCH2SiMe3 [16 mg, 0.172 mmol] in pentane (5 mL). After 30 min the green suspension was filtered, then concentrated in vacuo (∼1 mL) and placed in the freezer to obtain pure 15 as green crystals [79 mg, 0.121 mmol, 70%]. The reaction is quantitative by 31P NMR spectroscopy and matches the spectroscopic details for the previously published 15.
Kinetic Studies
The kinetic experiments were conducted as described below for the reaction of 1 to 2 and 2 to 14. Standard deviations for the entropy (ΔS⧧) and enthalpy (ΔH‡) were calculated on the basis of the two equations described by Girolami et al. (shown). (38) The NMR temperature probe was calibrated using an ethylene glycol standard and σT was determined by calculating the standard deviation in temperature measurement fluctuations and averaged over several temperatures. The standard deviations for the rates at three temperatures, collected in triplicates, were averaged to obtain σk.
For the Conversion of 1 → 2
In each experiment, 50 mg of 1 [0.086 mmol] was dissolved in 0.4 mL of FC6H5 and placed inside an oven-dried J. Young NMR tube with a HPCy3 capillary as an internal standard. The NMR tube was then placed in a temperature-controlled and calibrated NMR probe (10.0−40.0 °C) and monitored at set time intervals until ∼90% conversion to 2. No side products were evident by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The HPCy3 internal standard was referenced to −112 ppm and integrated to 1000. The decay of one doublet of the phosphine resonances of the starting material was recorded with time, and the resulting data were fit to a first-order kinetics plot. The rate constant at 25 °C (5.896(5) × 10−5 s−1) is an average of three trials. The experiment was repeated at various temperatures (triplicate runs at 15 and 35 °C and single runs at 10, 20, 30, and 40 °C) to obtain activation parameters of ΔH⧧ = 21(1) kcal/mol and ΔS⧧ = −7(3) eu. Inter- and intramolecular kinetic isotope effects (KIE) were determined in a similar manner to that described above. To obtain the intramolecular KIE, (PNP)Ti═CDtBu(CD2tBu) (2-d3) was prepared using LiCD2tBu (35) in place of LiCH2tBu. (35) An average of three trials at 25 °C produced a KIE of 4.04(7). To obtain the intermolecular KIE, the reaction was performed using 1 in FC6D5 as a solvent versus FC6H5. Triplicate runs were monitored at 25 °C to obtain a KIE of 1.01(17).
For the Conversion of 2 → 14
Complex 2 [50 mg, 0.078 mmol] was dissolved in 0.5 mL of toluene and placed inside an oven-dried J. Young NMR tube with a HPCy3 capillary as an internal standard. The NMR tube was then placed in a temperature-controlled and calibrated NMR probe (85.0−115.0 °C) and monitored at set time intervals until ∼90% conversion to 14. No side products were evident by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The HPCy3 internal standard was referenced to −112 ppm and integrated to 1000. The decay of one doublet of the phosphine resonances of the starting material was recorded with time, and the resulting data were fit to a first-order kinetics plot. The rate constant at 100 °C (4.96(16) × 10−5 s−1) is an average of three trials. The experiment was repeated at various temperatures (triplicate runs at 90 and 110 °C and single runs at 85, 95, 105, and 115 °C) to obtain activation parameters of ΔH⧧ = 29(1) kcal/mol and ΔS⧧ = −3(4) eu. The intramolecular kinetic isotope effect was determined in a similar manner to that described above, monitoring the conversion of 2-d to 14-d at 100 °C. An average of three trials produced a KIE of 1.0(3).
For the Conversion of 3, 4, 28, 30, and 31 → 14
Complexes 3, 4, 28, 30, and 31 [50 mg] were dissolved in 0.5 mL of toluene and placed inside an oven-dried J. Young NMR tube with a HPCy3 capillary as an internal standard. The NMR tube was then placed in a temperature-controlled and calibrated NMR probe (85 °C) and monitored at set time intervals until ∼90% conversion to 14. No side products were evident by 31P NMR spectroscopy. The HPCy3 internal standard was referenced to −112 ppm and integrated to 1000. The decay of one doublet of the phosphine resonances of the starting material was recorded with time, and the resulting data were fit to a first-order kinetics plot. The rates for the conversions of 3, 4, 28, 30, and 31→ 14 are listed in Table 3.
Concentration Dependence Studies
Following the protocol described above concentration-dependent studies at 85 °C were carried out at varying concentrations (0.078, 0.156, 0.234 M) in titanium for the conversion of 2 → 14.
X-ray Crystallography
Crystals of suitable size were mounted on glass fibers and measured at low temperatures (nitrogen and helium). The data collection for compounds 5, 6, 14, 17, and 32 was carried out using Mo Kα radiation (graphite monochromator) with a frame time of 10−90 s and a detector distance of 6.0 cm. Three major sections of frames were collected with 0.30° steps in ω at different ϕ settings and a detector position of −43° in 2θ. Data to a resolution of 0.77 Å were considered in the reduction. Final cell constants were calculated from the xyz centroids of the strong reflections from the actual data collection after integration. (39) The intensity data were corrected for absorption. (40) For compounds 11 and 32, the data collection was carried out using synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.44280 and 0.49595, diamond 111 monochromator, two mirrors to exclude higher harmonics) with a frame time of 1 s and a detector distance of 6.0 cm. A randomly oriented region of reciprocal space was surveyed to the extent of a hemisphere. Two major sections of frames were collected with 0.50ϕ and a detector position of −30° and 0° in 2θ. Data to a resolution of 0.80 Å were considered in the reduction. Final cell constants were calculated from the xyz centroids of the strong reflections from the actual data collection after integration. (39) The intensity data were corrected for absorption. (40) Table 4 depicts all pertinent crystal and refinement data.
