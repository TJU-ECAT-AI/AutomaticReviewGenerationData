Abstract 
Titanium silicalite catalyses the oxidation of alkanes, alkylbenzenes, 
I-chlorohexane, 
and methyl 
heptanoate with hydrogen peroxide, at very mild conditions. The reaction may be performed in water, 
acetonitrile, methanol and t-butyl alcohol, below 55°C. In the latter two solvents, the reaction is faster. 
Alcohols and ketones are formed at secondary and tertiary sites of the alkyl chain. Yields vary in a wide 
range of values, according to reaction conditions and to the nature of substrates. With n-hexane, yields 
higher than 90% on hydrogen peroxide can be observed. The rate of the reaction is strongly affected by 
acids and bases which are added to the reaction mixture. Some aspects of the reaction mechanism and 
the properties of the active species are discussed. 
Keywords: 
titanium silicalite, hydrogen peroxide, titanium peroxo species, hydrocarbon oxidation, low 
temperature oxidation, acidity, basicity , ketone synthesis, secondary alcohol synthesis. 
INTRODUCTION 
The oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons usually requires drastic conditions, 
i.e. high temperatures, strong oxidants, radical reagents. A mixture of products 
is formed in the vast majority of cases [ 1,2]. Due to the scientific and economic 
relevance of this reaction, many efforts have been made aimed at the devel- 
opment of new and selective catalysts 13 
] . 
A number of active catalysts which are able to perform the hydroxylation of 
alkanes under mild conditions have been described in the last two decades [ 4- 
121. Most of them are transition metal complexes with organic ligands. They 
usually require monooxygen donor oxidants, such as hydroperoxides, bydrogen 
peroxide and iodosobenzene. Some of them are also able to activate molecular 
oxygen [ 3,10-121. In this case, a reducing agent is also required. However, 
yields and selectivity are unsatisfactory. 
A new heterogeneous and inorganic catalyst for the oxidation of unactivated 
C-H bonds with hydrogen peroxide is reported here [ 13 
1. Titanium silicalite 
was previously shown to be an efficient catalyst for the epoxidation of alkenes, 
hydroxylation of aromatics, oxidation of alcohols, and caprolactam synthesis.

The structure and the overall reactivity of titanium silicalite have been de- 
scribed in detail [14-171. In this work it was found that titanium silicalite is 
also a catalyst for the oxidation of alkanes under mild conditions. After com- 
pletion of this study, two reports appeared on the same reaction [ 18,191, which 
prompted to publish these results. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials 
Methanol, t-butyl alcohol (Nlerck, analytical reagent grade ), acetonitrile, 
ethanol (C. Erba, WE-ACS 
1, liquid alkanes, l-chlorohexane, methylheptan- 
oate (Fluka, purum), alkylbenzenes (Fluka, GC Standards), propane (99% ), 
butane (99% ), isobutane (99.9% ), 33% hydrogen peroxide (Rudi Pont ) were 
used as received. Titanium silicalite (T&l ) was prepared according to exam- 
ple 1 of ref. 20 (TX& 2.8% ). TiG,/§iO, 
was obtained by impregnation of silica 
with TiCl, 1211. II-ZSM-5 
[22]? BOILC [23], AI-TS-1 (TX& 2.25%, AL& 
0.69% ) [ 241 were prepared according to literature methods. Gas-liquid chro- 
matographic (GE 
) analyses were performed on a IIewlett-Packard HI? 5880 
gas chromatograph, using a flame ionization detector. 
Oxidation ofpropane and butane 
1.74 g of TS-1 and 100 ml of a 0.306 M solution of hydrogen peroxide in 
methanol (water 5%) were charged in a glass pressure vessel (140 ml total 
volume) equipped with an inlet, an outlet for liquid sampling, and a thermo- 
couple. After cooling at - 20’ C, known amounts of propane or butane were 
dissolved in the slurry. The apparatus was then immersed in a water bath and 
maintained at 55’ C under magnetic stirring, Aliquots were removed at various 
time intervals and analysed by iodometric titration and by gas chromato- 
graphy. For GLC analysis a glass column (2.4 m x 4 mm) containing Porapak 
PS and a SE-30 capillary ~o~~rn~ 
(50 m) were used. Tbe identity of products 
was ~Q~firrned 
by comparison with authentic samples and mass spectra. Re- 
sults are shown in Table 1. The yields reported are based on hydrogen peroxide. 
Oxidation of 
linear and brandied alkanes 
Method A 
4.4 ml of hexane and 50 ml of a 0.307 ikf solution of bydrogen peroxide in 
methanol (water 5% ) were added to a YOO-ml 
round bottom flask fitted with a 
nitrogen inlet, a thermQ~ete~, a reflux condenser, and a magnetic stirrer. The 
flask was immersed in a water bath maintained at 55 o 
C. After the solution bad 
reached this ~em~e~at~re, 
0.856 g of TS-l were added under magnetic stirring.

RESULTS 
Titanium silicalite (TS-1) catalyses the partial oxidation of unactivated al- 
kanes with hydrogen peroxide, under mild conditions. Alcohols and ketones 
are formed according to reaction ( 1).

(1) 
A titanium derivative of silicalite-1 containing titanium atoms in lattice po- 
sitions, and hydrogen peroxide are both required for reaction (1). No C-H 
bond hydroxylation took place when t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was used 
as the oxidant. Ti02/SiOz, H-ZSM5, and Bor C (a boron derivative of silical- 
ite-1) did not show any activity, with TBHP or hydrogen peroxide used as the 
oxidant. TS-1 and AI-TS-I are very active catalysts. 
TS-1 catalyses the oxidation of linear, branched and cycle alkanes and re- 
lated compounds, with either organic or aqueous solutions of hydrogen per- 
oxide [ 131. In the latter, at lQO”C, even less reactive molecules, such as 2,2- 
dimethylbutane and 3-methylpentane, are readily oxidized [ 13,18,19]. In ho- 
mogeneous organic solutions and at lower temperatures, a higher selectivity is 
observed. Thus useful information for a better insight into the reaction mech- 
anism is gained. For this purpose, reactions in this study were carried out mostly 
in methanol solutions and below 60°C. In this solvent, side reactions such as 
methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen peroxide 
decomposition to oxygen, also occur. In some cases they are negligible. When 
less reactive molecules are studied, a major amount of hydrogen peroxide is 
consumed by these side reactions. Nevertheless a comparison between differ- 
ent substrates or different C-H bonds is still possible, by comparing yields and 
reaction times. 
Oxidation of linear alkanes occurs at secondary C-H bonds and produces a 
mixture of secondary alcohols and ketones (Table 1). No terminal oxidation 
products were detected in the reaction mixture below 55°C. n-Hexane reacts 
faster and gives higher yields than any other alkane. After 90 min, hydrogen 
peroxide conversion in methanol solutions is 98% at 55’ C. The yields of hex- 
anols and hexanones approach 90% on hydrogen peroxide (Tables 1 and 4). 
Unexpectedly, lower n-alkanes exhibited the following order of reactivity: 
n-hexane > n-heptane N 
n-octane > n-butane > n-pentane > propane. This or- 
der is not consistent with the decrease in diffusivity observed in zeolites, with 
increasing chain length of hydrocarbons [ 251. It is also not the result of prod- 
uct inhibition. Control experiments showed that neither acetone nor isopropyl 
alcohol inhibit alkane oxidation. 
Branched and cyclic alkanes react more slowly than linear ones (Tables 1 
and 2). The former are hydroxylated at tertiary C-H bonds and give tertiary 
alcohols (Table 2 ) 
. Again, oxidation at primary and secondary sites was not 
observed. Cyclohexane gives cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. The presence 
of one methyl substituent on the alkyl chain strongly decreases the yields of 
tertiary alcohols. These are 45% with isobutane, between 10% and 14% with 
2-methylbutane and 2-methylpentane, and even lower with 3_methylpentane, 
2-methylheptane and 2,2_dimethylbutane. 
255 
Oxidation of alkylbenzenes occurs at aromatic C-H bonds and at secondary 
sites of alkyl side chains. Therefore a number of products are formed, among 
which alcohols and ketones are predominant (Table 3). Ethylbenzene and 
n-butylbenzene are preferentially oxidized at a! and y 
positions. Hydroxylation 
of cumene was unsuccessful. 
Electron withdrawing substituents such as chlorine, carbonyl, hydroxyl and 
ester groups, exert a retarding influence on vicinal C-II bond reactivity. There- 
fore the regioselectivity is enhanced. Oxidation of l-chlorohexane and methyl 
heptanoate occurs at co-1 
and w-2 positions (Table 3 
). Mono-oxyfunctionali- 
zation is observed on lower alkanes even for alkane conversion up to 60% (Ta- 
ble 4). Diketones have only been detected in trace amounts in the oxidation of 
either octane or higher paraffins. 
Reaction kinetics are solvent dependent. Thus the rates of oxidation of 
n-hexane decrease in the order: t-butanol> methanol > acetonitrile (Table 4) I 
Adding water in t-butanol (TIM) 
decreases reaction kinetics. Nevertheless 
the oxidation of n-hexane may be performed also without any added organic 
solvent, just by mixing an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide with the hy- 
drocarbon and the catalyst (Table 4). Ethyl acetate and ethanol are unstable 
to TS P hydrogen peroxide. They undergo extensive oxidation when they are 
used as solvents. Thus yields as low as 34% and 13%, respectively, are observed 
in the latter, while in methanol and TIM yields higher than 90% can be achieved 
(Tables 4 and 5 ) 
. 
The oxidation of n-alkanes in water is not regioselective. Product distribu- 
tion at secondary sites is almost statistical. Ketones are preferentially formed 
at p and y positions (Table 4). In organic solutions a more complex behaviour 
is observed (Tables 1 and 4). In methanol and TIM, CH, groups which are 
nearest to terminal positions are preferentially oxidized: /MXI, > y-U-I, > 
6-@I-&. 
In acetonitrile, on the contrary, y-C& react faster than/3-CH,. Ketone- 
to-alcohol ratio increases in the order 6< y 
< /_? 
(Tables 1 and 4). Thus carbonyl 
groups are formed mainly at j3, 
while alcohols are predominant products at y 
and 6 sites. Investigation of either alcohol stability or n-hexane oxidation at 
different hydrogen peroxide to n-kexane co~ce~t~~tio~ ratios suggests that 
ketones are mainly formed by further oxidation of corresponding alcohols. In 
fact, the hexan-!&one to kexan-Sol ratio increases with alkane conversion. 
IIexan-Sol 
is oxidized somewhat faster than n-hexane. Cyclohexanol yields 
cyclohexanone at a comparable rate as cyclohexane oxidation. 
The kinetic isotope effect k,,k, 
was d~t@rrni~~d 
from the competitive oxi- 
dation of an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane-D,, in meth- 
anol solution GIG-MS 
analysis, at the end of the reaction, gave a CGII,lOII- 
to-CBD1lOH ratio equal to 3.76, and a C~~~~~~to”C~~~~~ 
ratio equal to 6.14 
for an overall cyc~obexano~-to-cyclobexa~o~e 
ratio equal to 4.24. This indi- 
cated a primary isotope effect kn/kn of 4.1 for the ~ydroxylatio~ of cyclohex- 
ane. Similarly in t-butanol a value of 4.7 for kH/kD 
was found. 
256 
Efforts were made to show possible intermediate radical species in the oxi- 
dation of n-hexane (Table 5). BIIT had no effect on the outcome of the reac- 
tion. Thus a radical chain mechanism in bulk methanol solution outside TS-1 
channels can be discarded. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and dichlorome- 
thane did not alter the rate of reaction and product distribution 
Moreover no 
CG 
chlorinated derivatives were found in the reaction mixture. 
In competition experiments, n-hexane and cyclohexane were preferentially 
hydroxylated relative to benzene. 
TS-1 has very weak acid properties. Its acid strength is comparable to that 
of S-l 
[26]. However, its catalytic activity shows a marked dependence on 
acids and bases which are added to the reaction medium (Table 6). Hydrogen 
chloride enhances the rate of hydrogen peroxide consumption, whereas it does 
not significantly change the product distribution. The yields, however, are 
somewhat lower because side reactions too become faster. Other strong acids, 
such as nitric, trifluoroacetic and p-toluenesulfonic 
acids, have a similar but 
smaller effect. Hydrogen fluoride shows a different behaviour. The latter sig- 
nificantly decreases the rate of the reaction. This might be due to the compe- 
tition of F- ligand for coordination on titanium sites, thus preventing the for- 
mation of a Ti( H@,) 
adduct. It is known from the literature that fluorine 
anion makes stable complexes with titanium [ 271. 
Al-TS-1, which has strong acid sites, gives the same products as TS-1, in 
lower yields (Table 6). It is also a less efficient catalyst, due to a lower titanium 
content. 
Kinetics and product distribution are also affected by lithium and sodium 
salts. Table 6 shows that they decrease the rates of the reaction and that this 
effect increases as their concentration increases (Table 6, experiments 7 and 
8). Addition of small amounts of hydrochloric acid compensates for the inhi- 
bition by lithium chloride and increases again the rate of reaction. From these 
results it appears that reaction kinetics are not lowered by the ligand properties 
of the anions Cl- and NO, m 
Although the latter is a worse ligand than the 
former for Ti4’, they have a similar effect on the reaction. 
Sodium acetate, which is a basic compound, completely stops the reaction.

l?egative results with amorphous TiOz/SiOZ and with silicalite-1 derivatives 
which do not contain titanium in their crystalline framework, and positive 
results with TS-1 and Al-TS-1, strongly suggest that the oxidation of unacti- 
vated C-II bonds on alkanes and other organic molecules occurs at lattice ti- 
tanium sites. The reaction occurs preferentially inside TS-1 channels, as in- 
dicated by shape selectivity effects. The yields and the rates of reaction, with 
n-alkanes C, 2 C, [ 131 are consistent with the decrease of diffusivity in zeo- 
lites with increasing molecular weight [ 251. Furthermore the higher reactivity 
257 
of cyclohexane, 
as compared 
to that of 2,2_dimethylbutane, 
is in good agree- 
ment with diffusivity 
studies made on these molecules by Wu et al. [ZS] . How- 
ever, adsorptive 
properties 
alone do not account completely 
for the reactivity 
trend of branched 
alkanes. The 3-methylpentane 
molecule has a cross section 
which is smaller than that of cyclohexane, 
and very close to that of a-methyl- 
pentane 
[ 28]. Nevertheless, 
the former reacts at a lower rate than the other 
two. It is likely that this result is due to steric constraints 
present 
during the 
transition 
state of H-abstraction. 
Two ethyl substituents 
make the tertiary 
C- 
H bond of 3-methylpentane 
more hindered than that of 2-methylpentane, 
which 
has two methyl groups at the same position. 
The reactivity 
order C-H,> 
C-H,, the inertness 
of CH, groups, the oxida- 
tion of side-chain 
C-H bonds on alkyl aromatics, 
and the preferential 
oxida- 
tion of n-hexane 
and cyclohexane 
relative 
to benzene 
are strong indications 
that the reaction 
proceeds 
through 
a homolytic 
mechanism. 
However, 
a free 
radical chain mechanism 
in bulk methanol 
solution is discarded because BHT 
inhibitor 
has no effect on the rate of n-hexane 
oxidation. 
Also, it is unlikely 
that C,H&+, 
radicals 
have a free existence 
outside, 
as well as inside TS-1 
channels, 
because no chlorinated 
organic products 
are formed in the presence 
of carbon tetrachloride, 
chloroform 
and dichloromethane. 
Although 
it is un- 
certain that carbon tetrachloride 
can diffuse inside TS-1 channels, 
dichloro- 
methane 
(and perhaps 
chloroform), 
because of its smaller cross section, may 
diffuse. 
Mono-oxyfunctionalization 
of lower alkanes and remote C-H bond oxida- 
tion on 1-chlorohexane 
and on methyl heptanoate 
can be interpreted 
with the 
assumption 
that the active species which attacks C-H bonds has also electro- 
philic properties. 
Electron 
withdrawing 
substituents, 
such as chlorine, 
hy- 
droxyl, carbonyl, 
and ester groups decrease electron density on the alkyl chain. 
Polar effects are larger on vicinal CH2 groups and rapidly decrease along the 
alkyl chain, in good agreement 
with experimental 
results. Thus, the overall 
reactivity 
of these compounds 
is lower and oxidation 
at a-1 and m-2 CH, is 
observed. 
These results are similar to those reported 
by Minisci and Citterio 
[29] for the chlorination 
and bromination 
of organic compounds, 
in which 
electrophilic 
chlorine, 
bromine 
and chloriminium 
radicals are involved. They 
found that l-chlorohexane 
and methyl 
heptanoate 
react at lower rate than 
parent alkanes and are chlorinated 
at w-l and o-2 positions 
[ 
291. 
Furthermore, 
following this assumption, 
the reactivity 
sequence found with 
n-alkanes 
is accounted 
for by combined 
polar and shape selectivity 
effects. 
o-Inductive 
donor 
properties 
of 
alkyl 
groups 
increase 
in 
the 
order 
CHB<CzH5<...<C,Hz,+1 
and reach an upper limit. Thus the electron 
den- 
sity of C-H bonds and their nucleophilic 
character 
consistently 
increase in the 
same order. At the same time, because 
of shape selectivity, 
the rates of the 
reaction 
decrease 
as the number 
and bulkiness 
of alkyl substituents 
on CH2 
groups increase. 
n-Hexane 
gives the highest rate of reaction 
as the optimum 
258 
result of these two opposite effects. With alkanes C,> C7, shape selectivity 
effects prevail and the rates of reaction decrease as chain lengths increase. 
The discussion so far leads to the conclusion that the reaction of hydrogen 
peroxide with lattice titanium atoms eventually gives rise to an electrophilic 
species, which abstracts homolytically a hydrogen atom from alkane C-H bonds. 
The radical C, Hint 1 which is formed, is then rapidly hydroxylated to give an 
alcohol. In the transition state of the rate-determining step, considerable C-H 
bond breaking occurs, as indicated by the primary isotope effect kH/kD = 4.1. 
Notari [ 151 and Huybrechts et al. [ 
191 
have suggested that a titanium per- 
oxo-species of type (I) is formed inside TS-1 and that the hydroxylation of 
C-H bonds is due to this species ] 
191. This proposal is as yet undemonstrated. 
Peroxo-compounds are easily formed by reaction of titanium complexes with 
hydrogen peroxide either in acid or basic solutions. Many studies have been 
devoted to their synthesis, structure, and chemical properties 130 and refs. 
therein]. Usually there is little agreement on the structures and formulae of 
most of them. However, a small number have been well characterized [ 31-331. 
They have the configuration (I), in which the peroxo-group acts as bidentate 
ligand forming a triangular Ti (0,) unit.

These are remarkably stable compounds. Mimoun et al. [32] and Ledon and 
Varescon [33] found that Ti(02) 
complexes do not react with alkenes and 
other organic compounds which are normally oxidized by Group V-VI transi- 
tion metal peroxo complexes. 
Hydroperoxo-titanium compounds, with structure (II) (R=H) have never 
been isolated. However, it has been shown that in the epoxidation of alkenes 
with alkyl or aryl hydroperoxides catalyzed by Group IV-VI metal oxide cat- 
alysts, including titanium, M-OOR species (R=Alkyl, 
Aryl) are the active 
oxidants [ 34-35 ] ~ 
They are formed by the reaction of the metal oxide with 
ROOH in solution. Furthermore, Ledon and Varescon [ 33 
] presented evidence 
that a tetraph@~ylpo~hyri~ titanium peroxocomplex, (TE’P )Ti (Cl,), which 
does not epoxidize alkenes, becomes an active catalyst once it is transformed 
to a cis-hydroxo (alkylperoxo)complex, 
(T~~)T~(~~) 
(OOR). 
In agreement with these literature data, which indicate that titanium alkyl- 
hy~o~eroxocomplexes of type (II) are formed in solution, (although they have 
never been isolated), our results in experiments with acids and bases strongly 
suggest that, from the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with lattice titanium at- 
oms in TS-1, a Ti-OOH species is analogously formed. Structures (III), 
(IV), 
and (V) are all consistent witb the results of this study and with the structures 
which have been proposed for the titanium sites in TS-1 [ 
15,161.

A five-membered ring is formed with a methanol molecule in (III), a Ti-OH 
group in (IV), or a lattice Si-OH group in (V) (Scheme 1). The stability of 
Ti-OOH species is therefore increased. At this stage of the research, it is not 
possible to establish which species, among (III)-(V), 
is actually formed in 
TS-1. (III) might account for the unique role of methanol solvent in the re- 
actions with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by TS-1. Species (III)-(V) 
are weak 
acids which can dissociate into a proton and an anion. The latter is stabilized 
by the hydrogen bond which is formed in the cyclic five-membered structure. 
In Scheme 2 the dissociation of (III) is shown.

Basic compounds shift the equilibrium to the right, thus decreasing the con- 
centration of the electrophilic species (III). Therefore, they decrease overall 
reactivity of TS-1/H202 system towards alkanes and alkenes [ 261. An oppo- 
site effect is shown by acids, which shift the equilibrium to the left. Results 
observed in other reactions catalysed by TS-1 further support Schemes 1 and 
2. They will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper [ 26 1. 
This study shows that a titanium hydroperoxo-species is formed by reaction 
of TS-1 with hydrogen peroxide. It is very likely that it has a five-membered 
ring structure, as shown by Scheme 1. However the experimental data avail- 
able at present time, from this work and from the literature [ 18,191, are not 
sufficient to establish the nature of the active species which is involved in the 
hydrogen-abstraction 
step. Further research is needed in order to clarify this 
important aspect of titanium silicalite reactivity.
