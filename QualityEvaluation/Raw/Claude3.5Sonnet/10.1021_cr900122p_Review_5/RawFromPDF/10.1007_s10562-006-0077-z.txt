The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence and absence of CO2 over b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide
catalysts has been studied. The eﬀect of chromium content and feed composition on the dehydrogenation of propane has been
investigated. It has been found that deposition of chromium oxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke
deposition. Moreover, it has been shown that CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane above 848 K. At that temperature in
the presence of CO2 both the yield of propene and conversion of propane were higher than in the inert gas atmosphere.
KEY WORDS: gallium and chromium oxides; dehydrogenation with CO2; propene.
1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of
CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative way for
obtaining propene with simultaneous conversion of CO2
to CO, which is more useful raw material for a number of
chemical processes. Several diﬀerent bulk and supported
oxide catalysts have been tested in this reaction. Diﬀerent
oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as active
components [1–10] and potassium oxide was introduced
as promoter [7,8]. Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3) [1–3],
mesoporous materials (MCM-41) [4] and carbonaceous
materials (diamond, active carbon) [1,5] were used as the
supports. Among them, chromium and gallium oxides
based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to
their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. These
observations led us to conclusion that it is worthwhile to
extend catalytic studies giving more attention to the cat-
alysts containing both of the latter mentioned materials.
In this communication, we report the results obtained in
the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and
absence of CO2 over b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide
catalysts. The b polymorph of Ga2O3 was taken as the
active support due to its high dehydrogenation activity,
thermal stability, and relatively high speciﬁc surface area.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation and characterization of catalysts
Bulk b-Ga2O3 was obtained by thermal decomposition
of Ga(NO3)3Æ8H2O at 923 K for 6 h in air atmosphere.
The chromium containing catalysts were prepared by
impregnation technique from an aqueous solution of
Cr(NO3)3. The chromium content in the catalysts was
regulated by varying the concentration of chromium salt
in the impregnation solutions. The solutions were mixed
with b-Ga2O3 and evaporation under constant stirring.
After the impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 423 K
for 2 h and calcined at 923 K for 3 h in air atmosphere.
The notation such Cr(3.4)O/Ga2O3 was employed for the
chromium oxide-based catalyst supported on b-Ga2O3,
with the value in parenthesis indicating the Cr content
(wt%).
Speciﬁc surface areas of the obtained materials were
determined by the BET method using Ar as adsorbate at
77 K.
The number and strength of Lewis acid sites were
determined by adsorption of pyridine after activation of
the samples in vacuum (10)6 mbar) at 723 K for 1 h. An
excess of pyridine was adsorbed at 440 K and next the
physisorbed phase has been removed by evacuation at
the same temperature. The adsorbed pyridine was sub-
sequently desorbed at 570 K, and the ratios A570/A440
(where A440 and A570 are the intensities of IR bands of
pyridine bonded to Lewis sites after the evacuation at
440 K and 570 K, respectively) were taken as the mea-
sure of the acid strength of the Lewis acid sites. The
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Equinox 55 IR
spectrometer

and
were
normalized to the 10 mg of sample.
2.2. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were carried out in a ﬂow-type
quartz reactor packed with 500 mg of catalyst (grain size

0.2–0.3 mm). The feed was a mixture of C3H8:He(CO2) at
the molar ratio 1:7. The total ﬂow rate of the feed was
30 ml/min. The reactants and products collected during
10 min on stream were analyzed using two gas chroma-
tographs. One of them was equipped with a column
packed with Porapak Q and a ﬂame ionization detector
(for hydrocarbon analyses). The other GC was equipped
with a column packed with Carboxen 1000 and, a thermal
conductivity detector (for H2, CO and CO2 analyses).
Coke amounts were estimated from amounts of CO2
and CO evolved during oxidative regeneration of the
catalysts at 873 K.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Eﬀect of chromium content
Table 1 lists the average conversion of propane and
the distribution of products in the dehydrogenation of
propane as a function of chromium content.
In addition to propene, products attributed to cracking
such, as ethene, ethane and methane as well as products of
deep oxidation of propane, carbon oxides (
<0.02% not
shown in table 1), were detected in the gaseous products
ﬂow. The results presented in the table conﬁrm high
dehydrogenation activity of bulk b-Ga2O3 reported pre-
viously [9,10]. It is clear that the deposition of chromium
oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average
yield of propene. With the increase of Cr content up to
6.8 wt%, the average yield of propene gradually increa-
ses, and then declines, which can be caused partially by the
lower surface area of the catalyst with the highest Cr
content. The average selectivity to products varies with Cr
content. In the case of propene the selectivity changes
between 84% and 88%, whereas the average selectivity to
coke gradually decreases with increase of Cr content.
Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we
suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the sur-
face of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly
active in the dehydrogenation process. Such species have
been previously proposed as the active sites for the
dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the case of CrOx/
Al2O3 [11,12]. Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases
the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the
catalyst, which was conﬁrmed by quantitative IR studies
of pyridine adsorption (ﬁgure 1).
3.2. Eﬀect of CO2
The eﬀect of reaction temperature on the dehydro-
genation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2
is shown in ﬁgure 2. The average conversion of propane
in the presence of CO2 is lower at temperature below
823 K, however, the conversion increases steeply with
temperature and exceeds the value obtained in He
atmosphere above 848 K.
In inert atmosphere, the average conversion of pro-
pane gradually increases up to 848 K and then rises
insigniﬁcantly with the further increase of the reaction
temperature. In the presence of CO2 the average yield of
propene increments in the whole temperature range,
while in the absence of CO2 it increases linearly up to
848 K and then declined. The average selectivity of
propene both in the presence and absence of CO2
decreases
with
temperature.

temperatures the decrease was more signiﬁcant in the
presence of CO2.
The insigniﬁcant eﬀect of the reaction temperature on
the average conversion of propane observed in He
atmosphere is probably related to the deactivation of the
catalyst by coke deposition. It is known that coke for-
mation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the
absence of gasiﬁcation agents like H2O or CO2. Thus,
increasing the reaction temperature enhances the deac-
tivation rate and consequently the average conversion of
propane increases slightly above 848 K. On the other
hand, such eﬀect is not observed in the presence of CO2.
This observation and the fact that at 848 K (where
similar average conversion of propane are achieved) the
amount of coke deposited during the dehydrogenation
of propane in the presence of CO2 was 40% lower than
that in He, clearly show that CO2 suppresses partially
the coke deposition. There are two explanations for this
phenomenon: (i) facilitation of desorption of propene by
CO2, which suppresses further deep dehydrogenation
resulting in coke formation; (ii) direct reaction of CO2
with coke (1).

The gasiﬁcation eﬀect of CO2 seems to conﬁrm the
calculations of the CO/C3H6 molar ratios in the process
in the presence and absence of CO2 (ﬁgure 3). In CO2
atmosphere, the molar ratio of CO/C3H6 strongly
increases with temperature from 0.7 at 773 K to 3.6 at
923 K.
On the other hand, the molar ratio of H2/C3H6 in the
presence of CO2 is lower than that in He, and is below
1.0 at 773–873 K (ﬁgure 3). Such results suggest that the
reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed simulta-
neously with dehydrogenation of propane.

Both of the reactions are probably responsible for the
promoting eﬀect of CO2 observed above 848 K.

4. Conclusion
The presented results lead to the following conclu-
sions:
 b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are
active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation
of propane. The high catalytic activity of these
catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating proper-
ties of both gallium and chromium oxides.
 Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of
b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,
which is caused probably by decreasing the surface
acidity.
 CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above
848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactiva-
tion by coke deposition.
