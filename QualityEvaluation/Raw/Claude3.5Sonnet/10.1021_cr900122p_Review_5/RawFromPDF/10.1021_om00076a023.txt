analyzed the lanthanum 
derivative contains two molecules of THF while the erbium 
and lutetium derivatives contain one molecule of THF. 
The complexes are not sufficiently soluble in THF for 13C 
NMR spectroscopy or isopiestic molecular weight mea- 
surement. 
Attempted alkyl derivatization 
of the (C&-Ia)LnC1(THF), 
series has been initially confined to Ln = La, Sm, and Lu 
due to the ease of characterization of these complexes and 
their reaction products by 'H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. 
Accordingly, we have synthesized the first cyclooctatet- 
raenyllanthanide alkyl and aryl complexes (CaHa)Lu[ 
C- 
H,Si(CH,),] (THF)2 (1) and (CaHa)Lu[o-CeH4CH2N- 
(CH,),](THF) (2) 
by reaction of (CaH&LUCl(THF) 
and the 
appropriate lithium reagent.', 
The reactions are con- 
ducted in THF at -78 "C, and the reaction mixture is then 
allowed to slowly warm to ambient temperature with 
stirring. Solvent is removed in vacuo, and the resulting 
oils are triturated with pentane or hexane to yield off- 
whitelbeige powders. After the mixture was washed with 
additional alkane solvent, the powders are extracted with 
toluene, and the solvent is removed in vacuo to yield 
spectroscopically pure 1 and 2 in 5045% yield (eq 1).

Unfortunately, analogous alkyl and aryl derivatives 
cannot be isolated for La and Sm. When R = CH2Si(C- 
H,),, no characterizable product can be obtained for Sm. 
For La, only the THF-soluble [(C8Ha),La] 
[Li(THF),] can 
be isolated (identified by infrared and 'H NMR spec- 
troscopy and complexometric metal analysis),'6 suggesting 
that the desired alkyl or alkyl intermediate has formed but 
is unstable with respect to ligand redistribution. In this 
context, it should be noted that [ 
(CBH~)~LU] 
[Li(THF),]17 
is an isolated byproduct in the synthesis of 1, indicating 
that, even at the end of the lanthanide series, ligand re- 
distribution is a concern when R = CH2Si(CH3),. When 
R = CeH4CH2N(CH3),, 
no characterizable product is ob- 
tained for either La or Sm. 
Despite these synthetic difficulties, this work clearly 
demonstrates that (1) an easily prepared homologous 
monocyclooctatetraenyl-based organolanthanide series 
exists and is available for systematic study and derivati- 
zation and (2) alkyl- and arylmonocyclooctatetraenyl- 
lutetium derivatives can be synthesized and characterized. 
Studies aimed at broadening the scope and number of 
these derivative complexes along with an investigation of 
their reaction chemistry are currently being conducted.

We have previously shown that bis(pentamethylcycl0-

surface area metal oxides such as

the organoactinide species present on the surface and to 
provide information concerning how, in general, such 
surfaces afford organometal-derived catalysts,2 we have 
undertaken a mechanistic investigation of the reaction of 
M[q6-(CH3)SC6]2(CH3)2 
complexes (M = Th, U) 
with 
partially dehydroxylated (or dedeuteroxylated) alumina 
(PDA or PDA-d) and nearly completely dehydroxylated 
(or dedeuteroxylated) alumina (DA or DA-d). PDA (Am- 
erican Cyanamid PHF y-alumina, 99.99% purity) contains 
ca. 4 surface OH (OD) groups (weak Brernsted acid), 5.5 
surface 02- 
(strong Lewis base), and 5.5 exposed AP+ 
(strong Lewis acid) sites/100 A2, while DA, although 
mainly composed of 02- 
and exposed AP+ ions, also con- 
tains ca. 0.12 residual OH unit/per 100 A2.3 In this com- 
munication we report several reaction pathways that have 
been identified; 
perhaps most significant 
is the observation 
that alumina surfaces may stabilize reactive metal alkyl- 
idenes in a manner analogous to recently documented 
solution chemistry. 
PDA and DA were prepared in flowing helium (475 "C 
and 950-1000 "C, respectively) and were deuterated 
(PDA-d, DA-d) as described el~ewhere.l~~**~ 
The com- 
pounds M[(CH3)&&(CH3)2 and M[(CHJ&I(CD3)2 (M 
= Th, U) 
were synthesized from CH3Li or CD3Li as re- 
ported previ~usly.~ 
The CD3 
groups in the latter com- 
plexes were shown to be >98% trideuterated by lH NMR 
(integrating vs. the (CH3)& resonance) and mass spec- 
trometry. Measured quantities (18-47 pmol) of the or- 
ganometallics 
were dissolved in pentane and slurried with 
0.25 g of alumina under rigorously anaerobic conditions 
in a previously described flow reaction/analysis systema6 
These loadings correspond to 0.3-0.7 actinide molecule/100 
A2 of surface area.3f The samples were then subjected to 
the following sequence of reaction conditions: flowing 
helium for 1 
h at 0 "C (pentane evaporation), for 1 
h at 
25 "C, and for 1 
h at 100 "C (abbreviated as 
follows: He, 
0 "C, 1; He, 25 "C, 1; He, 100 
"C, 1). Gases evolved during 
these time intervals were measured gas chromatographi- 
cally and were collected for mass spectrometric analysis. 
Labeling experiments were designed to probe three 
distinct methane-evolving pathways: H abstraction from 
a surface OH group;5a 
H abstraction from the (CH3)5C5 
rings; H abstraction from another methyl group. These

extensive, this would be evidenced by lack of self-con- 
sistency in the yield data, i.e., the sum of the three path- 
ways deduced from the three separate labeling experiments 
would not equal 100%. Furthermore, we find in control 
experiments that, under the reaction conditions, added 
methane does not undergo significant isotopic exchange 
with PDA-d or D A d 7  It is also conceivable, but at this 
time not established, 
that the quantitative reaction channel 
analysis might be biased somewhat by kinetic isotope ef- 
fects. This question is presently under investigation. In 
other work we have shown that U(1V) does not undergo 
detectable oxidation (evolve H,) under the reaction con- 
ditions,lbYc 
nor is it likely1bs5a 
that significant (CH3),C5H 
displacement occurs. 
The results of the labeling experiments are shown in 
Tables I and 1
1
.
 It can be seen in Table I that PDA with 
a high coverage of surface OH (OD) functionalities is far 
more reactive for methane evolution than DA, and under 
all conditions on PDA, pathway S dominates. It can also 
be seen in Table I that there is good self-consistency in 
the data (C(S + R + M) = 100%). Pathway S is con- 
siderably less important on DA, and although pathways 
R and M take on greater relative importance, the U[(C- 
H3),C512(CH3), 
data show that the absolute yields through 
He, 100 O
C
,
 via R and M are roughly the same on PDA and 
DA. The amount of methane produced via S in heating 
the uranium complex on DA through He, 100 OC, repre- 
sents approximately one-eighth of the surface OH content 
(ca. 8 pmo1/0.25 g). Table I1 shows that on DA, Th[(C- 
H3)5C512(CH3)2, 
and U[(CH3)5C51&CH3)2 
give comparable 
yields of methane and, furthermore, that the t
o
t
a
l
 
methane 
yield via pathway M is nearly the same for the two metals. 
Again C(S + R + M) i
=
 100% except in cases where the 
quantities of methane approach the detection limits. The 
molecularity of pathway M was investigated in a cross-over 
experiment whereby a 1:l mixture of Th[ 
(CH3)5C5]2(CH3)2 
and Th[ 
(CH3)5C5]2(CD3)2 
was subjected to the standard 
activation conditions on DA. It was found in all three 
activation periods that the methane isotopic distribution 
was identical with the sum of the distributions from the 
experiments. From these results it is possible to estimate 
that the percentage of pathway M which is intramolecular 
is greater than 95%. 
The course of and the environment in which pathway 
M occurs strongly suggest an analogy to the group 4B 
aluminum-stabilized alkylidenes of Tebbe, Grubbs, and 
separate Th[(CH3)5C512(CH3)2 
and Th[(CH3)5C512(CD3)2

chemical evidence. When pulses of acetone were passed 
at 25 "C over M[(CH3)5C5]2(CH3)2/DA 
that had been ac- 
tivated at He, 100 "C, 1, 
the major (70-90%) hydrocarbon 
product was isobutylene. For a large excess of acetone, 
(360 pmol), yields of isobutylene were -20% (M = U) and 
-38% (M = Th) on the basis of available surface meth- 
ylene calculated from the data in Tables I and 1
1
.
 Also 
produced in these reactions were traces (totalling <5% of 
the isobutylene 
yield) of ethylene, propane, propylene, 
cis- 
and trans-Zbutene, and five isomeric pentenes. Blank 
experiments indicated that only propane and propylene 
are primary reaction products of acetone and DA. When 
the above methylene assay was conducted with Th[(C- 
H3),C5I2(CD3),, 
the evolved isobutylene was found to be 
>99 % isobutylene-d, ((CH3),C=CD2) by mass spectrom- 
etry. The isobutylene formation can be interpreted in 
terms of the known methylene-transfer chemistry of 
species such as 
A89J2 (eq 1 
and 2). As for the trace, non-C3

that they might arise from propylene and/or isobutylene

No effort has been made to optimize any of the reaction 
pathways, and indeed, actinide ions are not likely to be 
optimum for any one particular pathway. However, on a 
more general leve1 and with specific reference to metal 
alkylidene stabilization by electron-deficient supports, it 
is not difficult to visualize how such species might play

Summary: Monohexylthlaborane 1, derived from CIS -3- 
hexene and 6-SBeH11, 
reacted with addltional cis-3-hex- 
ene at elevated temperatures to produce monohexyl- 
thlaborane 2, dihexylthiaborane 3, and trihexylthiaborane 
4 in a process called multiple hydroboration. Pyrolysis 
and displacement experiments with monohexylthlaborane 
1 and monooctyithlaborane 5, respectively, suggested 
that multiple hydroboratlon was reversible. 
Hydroboration has proven to be an effective means for 
generating organoboranes that have wide utility in syn- 
thetic organic chemi8try.l In most cases, only monomeric 
boron hydrides participate in the reaction. Previous at- 
tempts to treat unsaturated organic substrates with 
polyhedral boranes resulted in complex product mixtures 
and/or low overall yieldsS2 
We recently demonstrated that 
the borane cluster 6-SBeH11 
will add to 01efins.~ In our 
continuing examination of this novel hydroboration agent, 
we wish to report that additional borons on 6-SBgHl1 
en- 
gage in multiple hydroboration with olefins at elevated 
temperatures to yield di- and trialkylthiaboranes in high 
yields. This result suggests the possibility of employing 
6-SBgHl1 
for cross-linking olefinic polymers.

Figure I. The boron cage numbering scheme and the proposed 
structure of the products (monohexylthiaborane 2, dihexyl- 
thiaborane 3, and trihexylthiaborane 4) are depicted. 
Monohexylthiaborane l4 
(Figure 1) 
and a 10-fold 
excess 
of cis-3-hexene were placed in a pyrolysis tube, which was 
sealed under vacuum conditions and heated at 190 O
C
 for 
3 days. After removal of excess substrate, sublimation 
produced monohexylthiaborane 2, dihexylthiaborane 3,5 
and trihexylthiaborane 46 in 84% total yield. Preparative 
gas chromatography was then used to separate dihexyl- 
thiaborane 3 from the other species. 
GC/MS and proton-coupled 
llB NM'R data suggest that 
a second cis-3-hexene 
molecule adds to the thiaborane cage 
at boron 1. Assignment of the second hydroboration site 
was made by comparing the llB NMR spectra of mono- 
hexylthiaborane 1 and dihexylthiaborane 3 (Figure 2). 
The presence of a second singlet and nine signals in the 
dihexylthiaborane 3 spectrum indicated that a reaction 
took place at an asymmetric boron. Attachment of a 
second alkyl group induces a dramatic shift of the boron 
1 
signal, as was observed with the initial monohydro- 
boration at boron 9.' 
Nearly exclusive formation of trihexylthiaborane 4 was 
attained by heating monohexylthiaborane 1, a 10-fold 
excess of cis-3-hexene, and tetralin in a sealed tube for 3 
days at 200 O C .  GC/MS and llB NMR showed that tri- 
hexylthiaborane 4 and dihexylthiaborane 3 were present 
in the ratio 98:2, respectively, in 75% yieldes 
The proton-coupled llB NMR spectrum of trihexyl- 
thiaborane 4 is consistent with addition of a third olefin 
molecule onto the thiaborane cage. In contrast to di- 
hexylthiaborane 3 (Figure 21, the downfield shift of an 
additional boron signal combined with restoration of 
symmetry means that hydroboration occurs at boron 3. 
Extensive broadening obscures B-H coupling in tri- 
hexylthiaborane 4 at room temperature because of the 
quadrupolar nature of the IlB nucleu~.~ 
The spectrum 
shown in Figure 2 was taken at 100 "C and displays no- 
(4) Treatment of equimolar amounta of cis-3-hexene and 6-SB8Hl1 
in 
toluene for 4 h at room temperature produced monohexylthiaborane 1 
in 96% yield. Alkaline peroxide oxidation yielded 3-hexanol. Anal.

During the workup procedure, the removal of tetralin by distilla- 
tion also provides a separation of monohexylthiaborane 2 and dihexyl-
