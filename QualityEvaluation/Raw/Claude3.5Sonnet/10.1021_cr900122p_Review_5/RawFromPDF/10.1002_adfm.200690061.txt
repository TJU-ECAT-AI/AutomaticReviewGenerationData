Cover:
Low-voltage, hysteresis-free, flexible
thin-film-type electronic systems based
on networks of single-walled carbon
nanotubes and bilayer organic–inorgan-
ic nanodielectrics are detailed in work
by Rogers and co-workers reported
on p. 2355. The cover image shows
a schematic array of such thin-film
transistors (TFTs) on a plastic substrate.
The structure of the bilayer nanodielec-
tric, which consists of a film of HfO2
formed by atomic layer deposition
and an ultrathin layer of epoxy formed
by spin-casting, is also illustrated
schematically.
Inside Front Cover:
A bottom-up fabrication route for
PbTiO3 nanograins with dimensions
of 30 nm, based on predefined TiO2
nanostructures, is presented on p. 2346
by Karthäuser, Rathgeber, and
co-workers. The patterning of the TiO2
seeds was performed by means of a
self-organized micellar monofilm used
as an etching template. The dimensions
of the micelle template are transferred
across all process steps to the final
PbTiO3 nanograins.

A severely distorted 9,10-bis[4’-(4’’-aminostyryl)styryl]anthracene derivative (see
figure) exhibits enhanced two-photon absorption and subsequently generates strong
up-converted fluorescence upon nanoaggregation because of the planarization of
p-conjugation and the reduced intermolecular interaction by loose stacking.

Microstructuring of conjugated poly-

reported. The importance of polymer
structure in the preparation of self-orga-
nized, highly periodic, microstructured,
fluorescent, honeycomb films is demon-
strated. The light-emitting properties of
these high-surface-area films with peri-
odical patterns make them particularly
interesting.

A novel magnetic resonance imaging

in the figure, the robust multilayered
ligand shell formed around the gold
particles is able to bind many gadolini-
um ions, thereby yielding much greater

There is a fine line between too much
host–guest interaction and too little.
Guest species can be introduced into
mesoporous materials by solid-state
grinding (see figure) thanks to the
interactions between the host and guest
molecules. Host–guest interactions that
are too strong disturb the nanocasting,
whilst a lack of these interactions
inhibits the good dispersion of the guest
species.

A photoreactive hole-transporting

High-purity carbon nanofiber webs are

area, good electrical conductivity, high
reversible capacity ca. 450 mA h g–1)
that make it a potentially excellent can-
didate for use as the anode material in
high-power lithium-ion batteries, owing
to the highly reduced lithium-ion diffu-

tion and growth of PbS, CdS, and ZnS

here. As shown in the figure, this
strategy involves the nondestructive,

nanotube sidewalls with a bifunctional

of inorganic nanoparticles on the

ZnO–CuO nanostructures are

ambient conditions. ZnO products can
be 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets, or 3D
nanoscaffolds (see figure), in coexis-
tence with CuO nanowires. This method
provides a route to the simultaneous
fabrication of nanostructures with
different functions on the same

and structural differences are not
observed in analogous transistors with

Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)

complexes as phosphorescent dopants.
The color of electroluminescence (see
figure) and current-density–voltage
characteristics of the devices are deter-
mined solely by the Pt–Pt separation in
the complexes. White OLEDs are fabri-
cated using compounds 1 and 3 in three
different device architectures.
