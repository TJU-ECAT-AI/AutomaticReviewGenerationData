Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center"

[3] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[4] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[5] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. One site activates the CH bond to form a Ta-alkyl species and H2, then generates an alkene through β-H transfer, regenerating the tantalum hydride. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ. Both the formation and conversion of alkene intermediates occur within the metal center's coordination sphere.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n-1 and n+1 linear homologues, consistent with alkene metathesis as the key homologation process involving primarily 1-alkenes.

Cyclic alkanes like methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane also undergo hydrogenolysis, though at much lower rates. Cyclopentane is an exception.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as crucial intermediates. The formation of metallacyclobutanes, though not explicitly mentioned, is implied in the alkene metathesis step.

The selectivity towards linear products and the ability to process both linear and cyclic alkanes demonstrate the versatility of this catalyst system. The preference for 1-alkenes in the homologation process contributes to the selectivity observed in the product distribution.

Overall, the complex interplay between CH bond activation, alkene formation, and metathesis processes, occurring either on two separate sites or within a single metal center, enables the effective conversion of various alkanes. The catalyst's performance in these transformations is influenced by the nature of the alkane substrate and the specific reaction pathways available.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两位点和单位点方案：

在两位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。一个位点通过CH键活化形成Ta-烷基物种和H2，然后通过β-H转移生成烯烃，重新生成钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-亚烷基氢化物。

单位点机制涉及原位形成的钽烷基亚烷基中间体。烯烃中间体的形成和转化都在金属中心的配位球内进行。

对于直链烷烃，反应主要产生n-1和n+1直链同系物，这与烯烃复分解作为关键的均聚过程并主要涉及1-烯烃是一致的。

环烷烃如甲基环戊烷、环己烷和环庚烷也能发生氢解，但速率和转化数要低得多。环戊烷是个例外。

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和亚烷基氢化物作为关键中间体。虽然没有明确提到金属环丁烷的形成，但在烯烃复分解步骤中暗示了这一点。

对直链产物的选择性以及处理直链和环状烷烃的能力展示了该催化剂体系的多功能性。均聚过程中对1-烯烃的偏好有助于观察到的产物分布选择性。

总的来说，CH键活化、烯烃形成和复分解过程之间的复杂相互作用，无论是在两个独立的位点上还是在单个金属中心内发生，都能实现各种烷烃的有效转化。催化剂在这些转化中的性能受烷烃底物的性质和可用的特定反应途径的影响。
