Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center"

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate. Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes"

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism: 
1. CH bond activation forms Ta-alkyl species and H2
2. One site generates alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating Ta-H 
3. Other site forms Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer

One-site mechanism:
Ta-alkyl alkylidene intermediates form in situ
Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. Key steps include:
1. CH bond activation
2. Formation of alkyl, alkylidene, and alkene intermediates  
3. Alkene metathesis reactions

For linear alkanes, the process is selective for n±1 homologues, indicating 1-alkenes are the primary participants. This selectivity stems from the alkene metathesis step.

Cyclic alkanes (except cyclopentane) undergo hydrogenolysis but at lower rates. The mechanism likely involves ring-opening followed by metathesis steps.

The catalyst performance depends on the formation and reactivity of key intermediates like Ta-H, Ta-alkyl, Ta-alkylidene, and alkenes. Optimizing these intermediates through catalyst design can improve activity and selectivity for various alkane conversions.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及双位点和单位点方案:

双位点机理:
1. CH键活化形成Ta-烷基物种和H2
2. 一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃,再生Ta-H
3. 另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-亚烷基氢化物

单位点机理:
Ta-烷基亚烷基中间体原位形成
烯烃的形成和转化发生在金属的配位球内

两种机理都依赖于烯烃复分解和亚烷基氢化物中间体。关键步骤包括:
1. CH键活化
2. 形成烷基、亚烷基和烯烃中间体
3. 烯烃复分解反应

对于直链烷烃,该过程选择性地生成n±1同系物,表明1-烯烃是主要参与物。这种选择性源于烯烃复分解步骤。

环烷烃(除环戊烷外)也发生氢解,但速率较低。机理可能涉及开环后的复分解步骤。

催化剂性能取决于关键中间体(如Ta-H、Ta-烷基、Ta-亚烷基和烯烃)的形成和反应性。通过催化剂设计优化这些中间体可以提高各种烷烃转化的活性和选择性。
