[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center"

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate. Today, several catalysts have been developed on the basis of well-defined metal hydrides, alkyl alkylidene, or alkylidyne surface complexes"

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism: 
1. CH bond activation forms Ta-alkyl species and H2
2. One site generates alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating Ta-H 
3. Other site forms Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer

One-site mechanism:
Ta-alkyl alkylidene intermediates form in situ
Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. Key steps include:
1. CH bond activation
2. Formation of alkyl, alkylidene, and alkene intermediates  
3. Alkene metathesis reactions

For linear alkanes, the process is selective for n±1 homologues, indicating 1-alkenes are the primary participants. This selectivity stems from the alkene metathesis step.

Cyclic alkanes (except cyclopentane) undergo hydrogenolysis but at lower rates. The mechanism likely involves ring-opening followed by metathesis steps.

The catalyst performance depends on the formation and reactivity of key intermediates like Ta-H, Ta-alkyl, Ta-alkylidene, and alkenes. Optimizing these intermediates through catalyst design can improve activity and selectivity for various alkane conversions.

[1] "In 1997, Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (CniH2(ni)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides"

[2] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors and kinetic studies in flow reactors showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion"

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. 

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which form in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The key CC bond cleavage and formation steps involve [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, similar to alkene metathesis.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n-1 and n+1 linear homologues, indicating that 1-alkenes are the primary participants in the homologation process. This selectivity is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation step.

Cyclic alkanes also undergo transformation, but at lower rates. They yield lower cyclic homologues - for example, cyclohexane converts to methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, while cycloheptane forms methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane.

The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation of key intermediates (alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), the specific mechanism followed (one-site or two-site), and the structure of the starting alkane (linear or cyclic). The predominance of n-1 and n+1 products in linear alkane conversions demonstrates the catalyst's ability to control the degree of chain growth, which is crucial for its practical application in alkane upgrading processes.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种机制:双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中,钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程始于CH键活化,形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。然后,一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃,重新生成钽氢化物,而另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基烯基氢化物。

单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基烯中间体,这些中间体原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基烯基钽表面络合物形成。

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基烯基氢化物作为关键中间体。关键的CC键断裂和形成步骤涉及[2+2]-环加成和环反转,类似于烯烃复分解。

对于线性烷烃,反应主要产生n-1和n+1线性同系物,表明1-烯烃是均化过程的主要参与者。这种选择性与烯烃复分解作为关键均化步骤是一致的。

环烷烃也会发生转化,但速率较低。它们产生较低的环状同系物 - 例如,环己烷转化为甲基环戊烷和环戊烷,而环庚烷形成甲基环己烷和环己烷。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受到诸多因素的影响,如关键中间体(烯烃和金属环丁烷)的形成、所遵循的具体机制(单位点或双位点)以及起始烷烃的结构(线性或环状)。线性烷烃转化中n-1和n+1产物的优势表明了催化剂控制链增长程度的能力,这对于其在烷烃升级过程中的实际应用至关重要。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides are key intermediates. One site activates the C-H bond to form Ta-alkyl species and H2. This site then generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. 

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ. Both alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal center's coordination sphere.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates as key steps. Alkenes, particularly 1-alkenes, are crucial intermediates that participate in the homologation process through metathesis reactions.

For linear alkanes, the selectivity favors n±1 homologues, consistent with alkene metathesis as the key homologation step. This selectivity arises from the preferential formation and reaction of 1-alkenes.

Cyclic alkanes like methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane can also undergo transformation, but at much lower rates. The exception is cyclopentane, which does not react.

The formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates is implied in the alkene metathesis steps, though not explicitly mentioned in the quotes. These intermediates are crucial for the carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming processes in metathesis reactions.

The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions depend on the balance between dehydrogenation (to form alkenes), metathesis (to redistribute carbon chains), and hydrogenation (to form new alkanes). The preference for linear n±1 products suggests that the catalyst favors terminal alkene formation and reaction, leading to controlled chain growth or reduction.

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和亚烷基氢化物中间体作为关键步骤。烯烃,特别是1-烯烃,是通过复分解反应参与均化过程的重要中间体。

对于直链烷烃,选择性倾向于n±1同系物,这与烯烃复分解作为关键均化步骤一致。这种选择性源于1-烯烃的优先形成和反应。

环烷烃如甲基环戊烷、环己烷和环庚烷也可以发生转化,但速率要低得多。例外的是环戊烷,它不发生反应。

虽然在引文中没有明确提到,但金属环丁烷中间体的形成在烯烃复分解步骤中是隐含的。这些中间体对复分解反应中的碳-碳键断裂和形成过程至关重要。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性取决于脱氢(形成烯烃)、复分解(重新分配碳链)和加氢(形成新烷烃)之间的平衡。对直链n±1产物的偏好表明,该催化剂有利于端烯烃的形成和反应,从而导致可控的链增长或减少。

Cyclic alkanes like methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane also undergo hydrogenolysis, though at much lower rates. Cyclopentane is an exception.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as crucial intermediates. The formation of metallacyclobutanes, though not explicitly mentioned, is implied in the alkene metathesis step.

The selectivity towards linear products and the ability to process both linear and cyclic alkanes demonstrate the versatility of this catalyst system. The preference for 1-alkenes in the homologation process contributes to the selectivity observed in the product distribution.

Overall, the complex interplay between CH bond activation, alkene formation, and metathesis processes, occurring either on two separate sites or within a single metal center, enables the effective conversion of various alkanes. The catalyst's performance in these transformations is influenced by the nature of the alkane substrate and the specific reaction pathways available.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n-1 and n+1 linear homologues, indicating that 1-alkenes are the primary participants in the homologation process. This selectivity distinguishes the tantalum hydride catalyst from other alkane metathesis processes that generate a broader distribution of products.

Cyclic alkanes also undergo transformation, albeit at lower rates. They yield lower cyclic homologues, such as the conversion of cyclohexane to methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, or cycloheptane to methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane. However, cyclopentane is an exception and does not undergo this transformation.

The catalytic performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, as well as the specific reaction pathways available in the two-site or one-site mechanisms. The ability of the catalyst to facilitate both CH bond activation and CC bond cleavage/formation contributes to its effectiveness in alkane metathesis.
