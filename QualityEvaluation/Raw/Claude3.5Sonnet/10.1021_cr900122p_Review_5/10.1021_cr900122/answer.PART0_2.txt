Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center"

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides are key intermediates. One site activates the C-H bond to form Ta-alkyl species and H2. This site then generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. 

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ. Both alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal center's coordination sphere.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates as key steps. Alkenes, particularly 1-alkenes, are crucial intermediates that participate in the homologation process through metathesis reactions.

For linear alkanes, the selectivity favors n±1 homologues, consistent with alkene metathesis as the key homologation step. This selectivity arises from the preferential formation and reaction of 1-alkenes.

Cyclic alkanes like methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane can also undergo transformation, but at much lower rates. The exception is cyclopentane, which does not react.

The formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates is implied in the alkene metathesis steps, though not explicitly mentioned in the quotes. These intermediates are crucial for the carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming processes in metathesis reactions.

The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions depend on the balance between dehydrogenation (to form alkenes), metathesis (to redistribute carbon chains), and hydrogenation (to form new alkanes). The preference for linear n±1 products suggests that the catalyst favors terminal alkene formation and reaction, leading to controlled chain growth or reduction.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及双位点和单位点两种方案:

在双位点机制中,钽氢化物是关键中间体。一个位点通过C-H键活化形成Ta-烷基物种和H2。该位点然后通过β-H转移生成烯烃,重新生成钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-亚烷基氢化物。

单位点机制涉及原位形成的钽烷基亚烷基中间体。烯烃的形成和转化都在金属中心的配位sphere内进行。

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和亚烷基氢化物中间体作为关键步骤。烯烃,特别是1-烯烃,是通过复分解反应参与均化过程的重要中间体。

对于直链烷烃,选择性倾向于n±1同系物,这与烯烃复分解作为关键均化步骤一致。这种选择性源于1-烯烃的优先形成和反应。

环烷烃如甲基环戊烷、环己烷和环庚烷也可以发生转化,但速率要低得多。例外的是环戊烷,它不发生反应。

虽然在引文中没有明确提到,但金属环丁烷中间体的形成在烯烃复分解步骤中是隐含的。这些中间体对复分解反应中的碳-碳键断裂和形成过程至关重要。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性取决于脱氢(形成烯烃)、复分解(重新分配碳链)和加氢(形成新烷烃)之间的平衡。对直链n±1产物的偏好表明,该催化剂有利于端烯烃的形成和反应,从而导致可控的链增长或减少。
