[1] "Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (CniH2(ni)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides"

[2] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors and kinetic studies in flow reactors showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion"

[3] "Several mechanistic schemes are possible, involving either two sites or one site, and they involve well-known steps of molecular organometallic chemistry."

[4] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[5] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes"

[6] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[7] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. 

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. One site undergoes CH bond activation to form a Ta-alkyl species, which then generates an alkene via β-H transfer and regenerates the tantalum hydride. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism involves tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates formed in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis as the key homologation process, with alkylidene hydride as a crucial intermediate. The key CC bond cleavage and formation steps involve [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, similar to traditional alkene metathesis.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n-1 and n+1 linear homologues, indicating that 1-alkenes are the primary participants in the homologation process. This selectivity distinguishes the tantalum hydride catalyst from other alkane metathesis processes that generate a broader distribution of products.

Cyclic alkanes also undergo transformation, albeit at lower rates. They yield lower cyclic homologues, such as the conversion of cyclohexane to methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, or cycloheptane to methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane. However, cyclopentane is an exception and does not undergo this transformation.

The catalytic performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by the formation of key intermediates like alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, as well as the specific reaction pathways available in the two-site or one-site mechanisms. The ability of the catalyst to facilitate both CH bond activation and CC bond cleavage/formation contributes to its effectiveness in alkane metathesis.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及双位点和单位点两种方案。

在双位点机制中，钽氢化物作为关键中间体。一个位点进行CH键活化形成Ta-烷基物种，然后通过β-H转移生成烯烃并再生钽氢化物。另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-亚烷基氢化物。

单位点机制涉及原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊叉钽表面络合物形成的钽烷基亚烷基中间体。

两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解作为关键的均聚过程，亚烷基氢化物是关键的中间体。关键的CC键断裂和形成步骤涉及[2+2]环加成和环反转，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。

对于直链烷烃，反应主要产生n-1和n+1直链同系物，表明1-烯烃是均聚过程的主要参与者。这种选择性使钽氢化物催化剂区别于其他产生更广泛产物分布的烷烃复分解过程。

环烷烃也会发生转化，但速率较低。它们产生较低的环状同系物，例如环己烷转化为甲基环戊烷和环戊烷，或环庚烷转化为甲基环己烷和环己烷。然而，环戊烷是一个例外，不会发生这种转化。

在各种烷烃转化中的催化性能和选择性受到关键中间体（如烯烃和金属环丁烷）的形成以及双位点或单位点机制中可用的特定反应途径的影响。催化剂促进CH键活化和CC键断裂/形成的能力contributes to its effectiveness in alkane metathesis.
