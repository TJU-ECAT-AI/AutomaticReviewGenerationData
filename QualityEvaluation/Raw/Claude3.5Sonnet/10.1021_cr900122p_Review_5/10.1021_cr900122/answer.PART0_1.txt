Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "In 1997, Vidal et al. found that acyclic alkanes (CnH2n+2) are catalytically transformed into their lower and higher homologues (CniH2(ni)+2 and Cn+iH2(n+i)+2) in the absence of hydrogen by the silica supported tantalum hydrides"

[2] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors and kinetic studies in flow reactors showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion"

[3] "Several mechanistic schemes are possible, involving either two sites or one site, and they involve well-known steps of molecular organometallic chemistry."

[4] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates. After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[5] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes"

[6] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[7] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[8] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[9] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. 

In the two-site mechanism, tantalum hydrides act as key intermediates. The process begins with CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species. One site then generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides, while the other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer.

The one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which form in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes.

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates. The key CC bond cleavage and formation steps involve [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion, similar to alkene metathesis.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n-1 and n+1 linear homologues, indicating that 1-alkenes are the primary participants in the homologation process. This selectivity is consistent with alkene metathesis being the key homologation step.

Cyclic alkanes also undergo transformation, but at lower rates. They yield lower cyclic homologues - for example, cyclohexane converts to methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, while cycloheptane forms methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane.

The catalyst's performance and selectivity in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the formation of key intermediates (alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), the specific mechanism followed (one-site or two-site), and the structure of the starting alkane (linear or cyclic). The predominance of n-1 and n+1 products in linear alkane conversions demonstrates the catalyst's ability to control the degree of chain growth, which is crucial for its practical application in alkane upgrading processes.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及两种机制:双位点机制和单位点机制。

在双位点机制中,钽氢化物作为关键中间体。该过程始于CH键活化,形成H2和Ta-烷基表面物种。然后,一个位点通过β-H转移生成烯烃,重新生成钽氢化物,而另一个位点通过α-H转移形成Ta-烷基烯基氢化物。

单位点机制基于钽烷基烷基烯中间体,这些中间体原位从二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物或新戊基新戊基烯基钽表面络合物形成。

这两种机制都依赖于烯烃复分解和烷基烯基氢化物作为关键中间体。关键的CC键断裂和形成步骤涉及[2+2]-环加成和环反转,类似于烯烃复分解。

对于线性烷烃,反应主要产生n-1和n+1线性同系物,表明1-烯烃是均化过程的主要参与者。这种选择性与烯烃复分解作为关键均化步骤是一致的。

环烷烃也会发生转化,但速率较低。它们产生较低的环状同系物 - 例如,环己烷转化为甲基环戊烷和环戊烷,而环庚烷形成甲基环己烷和环己烷。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受到诸多因素的影响,如关键中间体(烯烃和金属环丁烷)的形成、所遵循的具体机制(单位点或双位点)以及起始烷烃的结构(线性或环状)。线性烷烃转化中n-1和n+1产物的优势表明了催化剂控制链增长程度的能力,这对于其在烷烃升级过程中的实际应用至关重要。
