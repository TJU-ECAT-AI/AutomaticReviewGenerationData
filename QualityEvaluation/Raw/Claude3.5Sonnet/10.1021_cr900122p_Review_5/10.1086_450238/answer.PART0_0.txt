The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text appears to be about a book review of "Local Government in Japan" by Kurt Steiner, which is unrelated to the chemistry topic in question. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of the alkane metathesis mechanism or discuss the catalytic processes, intermediates, or factors affecting selectivity and performance based on this document.

所提供的文献不包含任何与回答有关硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解问题的相关信息。这段文字似乎是关于Kurt Steiner所著《日本地方政府》一书的书评，与所问的化学主题无关。因此，我无法根据这份文档分析烷烃复分解机理，或讨论催化过程、中间体以及影响选择性和性能的因素。
