[5] "The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1: in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. Low coordination and electron-deficient metal centers are crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction steps: While not explicitly detailed in the given text, alkane metathesis typically involves:
   a) C-H bond activation to form metal-alkyl species
   b) β-hydride elimination to generate metal-alkene intermediates
   c) Formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates
   d) Cycloreversion to form new alkenes
   e) Hydrogenation to form new alkanes

3. Selectivity: The catalyst shows higher selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. For example, in propane metathesis, it produces more ethane and butanes (80% selectivity) compared to methane (10% selectivity).

4. Catalyst performance: The improved catalyst (6) shows higher overall activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1). It achieves 100 turnovers after 120 hours, compared to 58 for the original catalyst. This improvement is due to slower deactivation rather than a higher initial reaction rate.

5. Side reactions: The improved catalyst (6) is less active for hydrogenolysis compared to the original catalyst (1), with a 5 times lower initial rate for propane hydrogenolysis.

The text does not provide specific information on two-site vs. one-site mechanisms or the processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations. However, the improved performance and selectivity of the new catalyst suggest that it may better facilitate the desired metathesis pathway while suppressing undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a low-coordination, electron-deficient tantalum(III) monohydride supported on silica. This structure is crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction process: Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues through a redistribution process.

3. Key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism likely involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species, which are typical in olefin metathesis reactions.

4. Support interactions: The silica support plays an important role, as reactions between metal hydride intermediates and adjacent siloxane bridges can occur, forming new Si-H bonds.

5. Selectivity: The catalyst shows selectivity towards C(n-1) and C(n+1) homologues. For example, in propane metathesis, there is high selectivity for ethane and butanes (80%) with low methane production (10%).

6. Catalyst performance: The performance is influenced by factors such as deactivation rate and turnover number (TON). Modifications to the support, such as incorporating zirconium, can improve catalyst lifetime and overall activity.

7. One-site vs. two-site mechanism: The literature does not explicitly discuss one-site versus two-site mechanisms. However, the emphasis on low-coordination metal centers suggests a one-site mechanism may be more likely.

8. Linear vs. cyclic alkanes: The document focuses on linear alkanes (specifically propane), and does not provide information on cyclic alkane transformations.

The overall mechanism involves a delicate balance of metal center coordination, support interactions, and reaction conditions to achieve efficient alkane redistribution with high selectivity for desired products.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane homologue redistribution: The catalyst converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This process allows for the transformation of linear alkanes into both shorter and longer chain alkanes.

2. Low coordination of tantalum: The catalytic performance is optimized by maintaining a low coordination environment around the tantalum center. This is achieved by grafting tantalum on metal hydroxides, which helps maintain the necessary electron deficiency at the metal center.

3. Formation of key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned in the given excerpts, alkane metathesis typically involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species. These intermediates are crucial for the redistribution of carbon atoms in the alkane chains.

4. Selectivity: The tantalum hydride catalyst supported on zirconium hydroxide (catalyst 6) shows improved selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride (catalyst 1). Specifically, catalyst 6 produces 80% ethane and butanes, with only 10% methane, while catalyst 1 produces 70% ethane and butanes, with 20% methane.

5. Reduced hydrogenolysis: Catalyst 6 exhibits lower hydrogenolysis activity compared to catalyst 1, with the initial rate of propane hydrogenolysis being about 5 times lower. This reduced side reaction likely contributes to the improved overall performance and selectivity of catalyst 6.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although the specific details are not provided in the given excerpts. The one-site mechanism would involve the formation and transformation of metallacyclobutane intermediates on a single tantalum center, while the two-site mechanism would involve the cooperation of two tantalum centers in the redistribution process.

The improved performance of catalyst 6 can be attributed to its modified coordination environment, which likely stabilizes the active species and promotes the desired metathesis pathway over competing reactions like hydrogenolysis. This results in higher selectivity for the desired alkane homologues and improved catalyst longevity.

烷烃复分解反应由硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化的机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 烷烃同系物重新分配：催化剂将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。这一过程允许将直链烷烃转化为更短和更长链的烷烃。

2. 钽的低配位：通过保持钽中心周围的低配位环境来优化催化性能。这是通过将钽接枝到金属氢氧化物上实现的，有助于维持金属中心所需的电子缺陷。

3. 关键中间体的形成：虽然在给定的摘录中没有明确提及，但烷烃复分解通常涉及烯烃中间体和金属环丁烷物种的形成。这些中间体对于烷烃链中碳原子的重新分配至关重要。

4. 选择性：与硅胶负载的钽氢化物（催化剂1）相比，氧化锆氢氧化物支持的钽氢化物催化剂（催化剂6）对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物表现出更好的选择性。具体来说，催化剂6产生80%的乙烷和丁烷，仅10%的甲烷，而催化剂1产生70%的乙烷和丁烷，20%的甲烷。

5. 减少氢解：与催化剂1相比，催化剂6表现出较低的氢解活性，丙烷氢解的初始速率约为前者的1/5。这种副反应的减少可能有助于催化剂6的整体性能和选择性的改善。

该机理可能涉及单位点和双位点途径，尽管在给定的摘录中没有提供具体细节。单位点机制将涉及在单个钽中心上形成和转化金属环丁烷中间体，而双位点机制将涉及两个钽中心在重新分配过程中的协同作用。

催化剂6性能的改善可归因于其改进的配位环境，这可能稳定了活性物种并促进了所需的复分解途径，而不是竞争反应如氢解。这导致了对所需烷烃同系物的更高选择性和改善的催化剂寿命。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane homologue redistribution: The catalyst converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This results in a mixture of products with different carbon chain lengths.

2. Low coordination and electron deficiency: The active catalyst requires low coordination, electron-deficient metal centers. This structural feature is crucial for catalytic performance.

3. Formation of intermediates: While not explicitly stated, the process likely involves the formation of alkene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. These are typical intermediates in metathesis reactions.

4. Product formation: The reaction produces a mixture of products, including methane, ethane, and higher alkanes. The relative proportions of these products depend on the specific catalyst used.

5. Catalyst performance: The tantalum hydride supported on zirconium hydroxide (6) shows improved performance compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride (1). This includes:

   a) Higher turnover number (TON): 100 vs 58 after 120 hours.
   b) Slower deactivation: Deactivation occurs after 20 hours for 6, compared to 8 hours for 1.
   c) Improved selectivity: 6 shows higher selectivity towards ethane and butanes (80%) and lower methane production (10%) compared to 1 (70% and 20% respectively).

6. Support effect: The presence of zirconium in the support appears to enhance catalyst performance, possibly by maintaining low coordination of the tantalum center.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although the document does not provide explicit details on these. The improved performance of the zirconium-supported catalyst suggests that the support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active species and influencing product selectivity.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. While the literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the two-site and one-site schemes, it does offer insights into key aspects of the catalytic process.

The catalyst is based on a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. The reaction mechanism relies on low coordination, electron-deficient metal centers, which are crucial for catalytic performance. The addition of ancillary ligands is generally detrimental to the catalyst's activity.

The literature does not explicitly discuss the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. However, the selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues suggests that these intermediates likely play a role in the reaction mechanism.

The performance of the catalyst is characterized by its turnover number (TON) and deactivation rate. An improved catalyst formulation (referred to as 6 in the text) showed higher activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1), achieving 100 turnovers after 120 hours instead of 58. This improvement is attributed to slower deactivation rather than a higher initial reaction rate.

Regarding selectivity, the improved catalyst (6) demonstrates higher selectivity towards ethane and butanes (80% combined) with lower methane production (10%) compared to the original catalyst (1), which produced 70% ethane and butanes and 20% methane.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, it is clear that the catalyst's performance varies depending on its formulation and support. The presence of zirconium in the support appears to enhance catalytic activity and lifetime, although the exact role of zirconium is not fully explained in the given text.

烷烃复分解反应由硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化，其机理涉及将给定的烷烃转化为其低级和高级同系物。虽然文献没有提供关于双位点和单位点方案的全面解释，但确实对催化过程的关键方面提供了一些见解。

催化剂基于硅胶负载的钽(III)单氢化物[(SiO2)TaH]。反应机理依赖于低配位、缺电子的金属中心，这对催化性能至关重要。添加辅助配体通常会降低催化剂的活性。

文献没有明确讨论烯烃和金属环丁烷等关键中间体的形成。然而，对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物的选择性表明，这些中间体可能在反应机理中发挥作用。

催化剂的性能通过其转化数(TON)和失活率来表征。改进的催化剂配方(文中称为6)与原始催化剂(1)相比，显示出更高的活性和更长的寿命，在120小时后达到100次转化，而不是58次。这种改进归因于较慢的失活速度，而不是更高的初始反应速率。

关于选择性，改进的催化剂(6)对乙烷和丁烷的选择性更高(合计80%)，甲烷产量更低(10%)，而原始催化剂(1)产生70%的乙烷和丁烷，20%的甲烷。

虽然文献没有提供有关线性和环状烷烃转化过程的详细信息，但很明显，催化剂的性能因其配方和载体而异。载体中锆的存在似乎能够提高催化活性和寿命，尽管给定的文本中没有完全解释锆的确切作用。
