          "One process, which allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis. This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

"The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1)"

"structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordination electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."

"Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 8 h for 1."

"Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

"The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1: in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

"Note that treatment of well-defined silica supported perhydrocarbyl complexes of early transition metals under H2 gives hydrides along with (SiH), which has been explained by the reaction of putative metal hydride intermediates with adjacent siloxane bridges."

          The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. Low coordination and electron-deficient metal centers are crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction process: Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues through a redistribution process.

3. Key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism likely involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species, which are typical in olefin metathesis reactions.

4. Support interactions: The silica support plays an important role, as reactions between metal hydride intermediates and adjacent siloxane bridges can occur, forming new Si-H bonds.

5. Selectivity: The catalyst shows selectivity towards C(n-1) and C(n+1) homologues. For example, an improved catalyst (6) shows 80% selectivity for ethane and butanes, with only 10% methane production.

6. Catalyst performance: The performance is influenced by factors such as deactivation rate and turnover number (TON). The improved catalyst (6) shows higher overall activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1), achieving 100 turnovers after 120 hours, compared to 58 for the original catalyst.

7. Side reactions: The improved catalyst (6) is less active for hydrogenolysis compared to the original catalyst (1), with a 5 times lower initial rate for propane hydrogenolysis.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although specific details are not provided. The improved performance of catalyst 6 can be attributed to its modified coordination environment, which likely stabilizes the active species and promotes the desired metathesis pathway over competing reactions like hydrogenolysis.

          由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及以下几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂结构：活性催化剂是一种二氧化硅支撑的钽(III)单氢化物[(SiO2)TaH]。低配位和缺电子的金属中心对催化性能至关重要。

2. 反应过程：烷烃复分解通过重新分配过程将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。

3. 关键中间体：虽然没有明确提及，但该机制可能涉及烯烃中间体和金属环丁烷物种的形成，这在烯烃复分解反应中很常见。

4. 载体相互作用：二氧化硅载体起着重要作用，因为金属氢化物中间体与相邻的硅氧烷桥之间可能发生反应，形成新的Si-H键。

5. 选择性：催化剂对C(n-1)和C(n+1)同系物表现出选择性。例如，改进的催化剂(6)对乙烷和丁烷的选择性为80%，而甲烷产量仅为10%。

6. 催化剂性能：性能受到诸如失活速率和转化数（TON）等因素的影响。改进的催化剂（6）与原始催化剂（1）相比，显示出更高的整体活性和更长的寿命，在120小时后达到100次转化，而原始催化剂为58次。

7. 副反应：改进的催化剂（6）在氢解反应中的活性比原始催化剂（1）低，丙烷氢解的初始速率低5倍。

该机制可能涉及单位点和双位点途径，尽管没有提供具体细节。催化剂6性能的改善可归因于其改进的配位环境，这可能稳定了活性物种并促进了所需的复分解途径，而不是竞争反应如氢解。
