[1] "One process, which allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis. This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

[2] "The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1)"

[3] "structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordination electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."

[4] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 8 h for 1."

[5] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. While the literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the two-site and one-site schemes, it does offer insights into key aspects of the catalytic process.

The catalyst is based on a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. The reaction mechanism relies on low coordination, electron-deficient metal centers, which are crucial for catalytic performance. The addition of ancillary ligands is generally detrimental to the catalyst's activity.

The literature does not explicitly discuss the formation of key intermediates such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes. However, the selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues suggests that these intermediates likely play a role in the reaction mechanism.

The performance of the catalyst is characterized by its turnover number (TON) and deactivation rate. An improved catalyst formulation (referred to as 6 in the text) showed higher activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1), achieving 100 turnovers after 120 hours instead of 58. This improvement is attributed to slower deactivation rather than a higher initial reaction rate.

Regarding selectivity, the improved catalyst (6) demonstrates higher selectivity towards ethane and butanes (80% combined) with lower methane production (10%) compared to the original catalyst (1), which produced 70% ethane and butanes and 20% methane.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, it is clear that the catalyst's performance varies depending on its formulation and support. The presence of zirconium in the support appears to enhance catalytic activity and lifetime, although the exact role of zirconium is not fully explained in the given text.

烷烃复分解反应由硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化，其机理涉及将给定的烷烃转化为其低级和高级同系物。虽然文献没有提供关于双位点和单位点方案的全面解释，但确实对催化过程的关键方面提供了一些见解。

催化剂基于硅胶负载的钽(III)单氢化物[(SiO2)TaH]。反应机理依赖于低配位、缺电子的金属中心，这对催化性能至关重要。添加辅助配体通常会降低催化剂的活性。

文献没有明确讨论烯烃和金属环丁烷等关键中间体的形成。然而，对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物的选择性表明，这些中间体可能在反应机理中发挥作用。

催化剂的性能通过其转化数(TON)和失活率来表征。改进的催化剂配方(文中称为6)与原始催化剂(1)相比，显示出更高的活性和更长的寿命，在120小时后达到100次转化，而不是58次。这种改进归因于较慢的失活速度，而不是更高的初始反应速率。

关于选择性，改进的催化剂(6)对乙烷和丁烷的选择性更高(合计80%)，甲烷产量更低(10%)，而原始催化剂(1)产生70%的乙烷和丁烷，20%的甲烷。

虽然文献没有提供有关线性和环状烷烃转化过程的详细信息，但很明显，催化剂的性能因其配方和载体而异。载体中锆的存在似乎能够提高催化活性和寿命，尽管给定的文本中没有完全解释锆的确切作用。
