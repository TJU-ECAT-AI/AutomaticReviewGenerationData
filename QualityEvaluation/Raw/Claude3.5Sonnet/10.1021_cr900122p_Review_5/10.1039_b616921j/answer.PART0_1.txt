[1] "One process, which allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis. This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

[2] "The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1)"

[3] "structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordination electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."

[4] "Note that treatment of well-defined silica supported perhydrocarbyl complexes of early transition metals under H2 gives hydrides along with (SiH), which has been explained by the reaction of putative metal hydride intermediates with adjacent siloxane bridges."

[5] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 8 h for 1."

[6] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a low-coordination, electron-deficient tantalum(III) monohydride supported on silica. This structure is crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction process: Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues through a redistribution process.

3. Key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism likely involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species, which are typical in olefin metathesis reactions.

4. Support interactions: The silica support plays an important role, as reactions between metal hydride intermediates and adjacent siloxane bridges can occur, forming new Si-H bonds.

5. Selectivity: The catalyst shows selectivity towards C(n-1) and C(n+1) homologues. For example, in propane metathesis, there is high selectivity for ethane and butanes (80%) with low methane production (10%).

6. Catalyst performance: The performance is influenced by factors such as deactivation rate and turnover number (TON). Modifications to the support, such as incorporating zirconium, can improve catalyst lifetime and overall activity.

7. One-site vs. two-site mechanism: The literature does not explicitly discuss one-site versus two-site mechanisms. However, the emphasis on low-coordination metal centers suggests a one-site mechanism may be more likely.

8. Linear vs. cyclic alkanes: The document focuses on linear alkanes (specifically propane), and does not provide information on cyclic alkane transformations.

The overall mechanism involves a delicate balance of metal center coordination, support interactions, and reaction conditions to achieve efficient alkane redistribution with high selectivity for desired products.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及以下几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂结构：活性催化剂是一种低配位、缺电子的二氧化硅支撑的钽(III)单氢化物。这种结构对催化性能至关重要。

2. 反应过程：烷烃复分解通过重新分配过程将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。

3. 关键中间体：虽然没有明确提及，但该机制可能涉及烯烃中间体和金属环丁烷物种的形成，这在烯烃复分解反应中很常见。

4. 载体相互作用：二氧化硅载体起着重要作用，因为金属氢化物中间体与相邻的硅氧烷桥之间可能发生反应，形成新的Si-H键。

5. 选择性：催化剂对C(n-1)和C(n+1)同系物表现出选择性。例如，在丙烷复分解中，乙烷和丁烷的选择性高（80%），甲烷产量低（10%）。

6. 催化剂性能：性能受到诸如失活速率和转化数（TON）等因素的影响。对载体的修饰，如引入锆，可以改善催化剂寿命和整体活性。

7. 单位点与双位点机制：文献没有明确讨论单位点与双位点机制。然而，对低配位金属中心的强调表明单位点机制可能更为可能。

8. 链状与环状烷烃：文档主要关注链状烷烃（特别是丙烷），没有提供关于环状烷烃转化的信息。

总的来说，该机制涉及金属中心配位、载体相互作用和反应条件的微妙平衡，以实现高选择性所需产物的高效烷烃重新分配。
