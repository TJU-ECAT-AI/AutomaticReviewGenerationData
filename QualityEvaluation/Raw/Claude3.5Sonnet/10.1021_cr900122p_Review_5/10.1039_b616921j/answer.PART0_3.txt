The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane homologue redistribution: The catalyst converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This results in a mixture of products with different carbon chain lengths.

2. Low coordination and electron deficiency: The active catalyst requires low coordination, electron-deficient metal centers. This structural feature is crucial for catalytic performance.

3. Formation of intermediates: While not explicitly stated, the process likely involves the formation of alkene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. These are typical intermediates in metathesis reactions.

4. Product formation: The reaction produces a mixture of products, including methane, ethane, and higher alkanes. The relative proportions of these products depend on the specific catalyst used.

5. Catalyst performance: The tantalum hydride supported on zirconium hydroxide (6) shows improved performance compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride (1). This includes:

   a) Higher turnover number (TON): 100 vs 58 after 120 hours.
   b) Slower deactivation: Deactivation occurs after 20 hours for 6, compared to 8 hours for 1.
   c) Improved selectivity: 6 shows higher selectivity towards ethane and butanes (80%) and lower methane production (10%) compared to 1 (70% and 20% respectively).

6. Support effect: The presence of zirconium in the support appears to enhance catalyst performance, possibly by maintaining low coordination of the tantalum center.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although the document does not provide explicit details on these. The improved performance of the zirconium-supported catalyst suggests that the support plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active species and influencing product selectivity.

烷烃复分解反应由硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化的机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 烷烃同系物重分配：催化剂将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。这导致产生不同碳链长度的产物混合物。

2. 低配位和电子缺陷：活性催化剂需要低配位、电子缺陷的金属中心。这一结构特征对催化性能至关重要。

3. 中间体的形成：虽然没有明确说明，但该过程可能涉及烯烃和金属环丁烷中间体的形成。这些是复分解反应中的典型中间体。

4. 产物形成：反应产生一系列产物，包括甲烷、乙烷和更高级的烷烃。这些产物的相对比例取决于所使用的具体催化剂。

5. 催化剂性能：与硅胶负载的钽氢化物(1)相比，氢氧化锆负载的钽氢化物(6)显示出改进的性能。这包括：

   a) 更高的转化数(TON)：120小时后为100，相比之下1为58。
   b) 更慢的失活：6在20小时后失活，而1在8小时后失活。
   c) 改进的选择性：6对乙烷和丁烷的选择性更高(80%)，甲烷产量更低(10%)，相比之下1分别为70%和20%。

6. 载体效应：载体中锆的存在似乎能增强催化剂性能，可能是通过维持钽中心的低配位状态。

该机理可能涉及单位点和双位点途径，尽管文档没有提供这些方面的明确细节。锆负载催化剂性能的改善表明，载体在稳定活性物种和影响产物选择性方面起着关键作用。
