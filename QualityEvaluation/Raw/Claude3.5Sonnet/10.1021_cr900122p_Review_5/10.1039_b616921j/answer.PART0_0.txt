[1] "The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1)"

[2] "structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordination electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."

[3] "Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 8 h for 1."

[4] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

[5] "The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1: in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. Low coordination and electron-deficient metal centers are crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction steps: While not explicitly detailed in the given text, alkane metathesis typically involves:
   a) C-H bond activation to form metal-alkyl species
   b) β-hydride elimination to generate metal-alkene intermediates
   c) Formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates
   d) Cycloreversion to form new alkenes
   e) Hydrogenation to form new alkanes

3. Selectivity: The catalyst shows higher selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. For example, in propane metathesis, it produces more ethane and butanes (80% selectivity) compared to methane (10% selectivity).

4. Catalyst performance: The improved catalyst (6) shows higher overall activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1). It achieves 100 turnovers after 120 hours, compared to 58 for the original catalyst. This improvement is due to slower deactivation rather than a higher initial reaction rate.

5. Side reactions: The improved catalyst (6) is less active for hydrogenolysis compared to the original catalyst (1), with a 5 times lower initial rate for propane hydrogenolysis.

The text does not provide specific information on two-site vs. one-site mechanisms or the processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations. However, the improved performance and selectivity of the new catalyst suggest that it may better facilitate the desired metathesis pathway while suppressing undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键方面：

1. 催化剂结构：活性催化剂是硅胶负载的钽(III)单氢化物[(SiO2)TaH]。低配位和缺电子的金属中心对催化性能至关重要。

2. 反应步骤：虽然给定文本中没有明确详述，但烷烃复分解通常涉及：
   a) C-H键活化形成金属-烷基物种
   b) β-氢消除生成金属-烯烃中间体
   c) 形成金属环丁烷中间体
   d) 环反转生成新的烯烃
   e) 氢化形成新的烷烃

3. 选择性：催化剂对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物显示更高的选择性。例如，在丙烷复分解中，它产生更多的乙烷和丁烷（80%选择性），而甲烷的选择性较低（10%）。

4. 催化剂性能：改进的催化剂（6）与原始催化剂（1）相比，显示出更高的整体活性和更长的寿命。它在120小时后达到100次转化，而原始催化剂为58次。这种改进是由于较慢的失活速率，而不是更高的初始反应速率。

5. 副反应：改进的催化剂（6）在氢解反应中的活性比原始催化剂（1）低，丙烷氢解的初始速率低5倍。

文本没有提供关于双位点vs.单位点机制或环状烷烃转化过程的具体信息。然而，新催化剂的改进性能和选择性表明，它可能更好地促进所需的复分解途径，同时抑制不需要的副反应，如氢解。
