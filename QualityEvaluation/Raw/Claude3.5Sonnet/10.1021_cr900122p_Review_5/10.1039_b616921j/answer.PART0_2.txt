[1] "One process, which allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis. This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

[2] "The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1)"

[3] "In view of optimising the catalytic performances, one possible approach is to change the coordination sphere of tantalum by grafting the tantalum on a metal hydroxide obtained through epitaxy with the hope that similar low coordination would occur."

[4] "Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

[5] "The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1: in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane homologue redistribution: The catalyst converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues. This process allows for the transformation of linear alkanes into both shorter and longer chain alkanes.

2. Low coordination of tantalum: The catalytic performance is optimized by maintaining a low coordination environment around the tantalum center. This is achieved by grafting tantalum on metal hydroxides, which helps maintain the necessary electron deficiency at the metal center.

3. Formation of key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned in the given excerpts, alkane metathesis typically involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species. These intermediates are crucial for the redistribution of carbon atoms in the alkane chains.

4. Selectivity: The tantalum hydride catalyst supported on zirconium hydroxide (catalyst 6) shows improved selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues compared to the silica-supported tantalum hydride (catalyst 1). Specifically, catalyst 6 produces 80% ethane and butanes, with only 10% methane, while catalyst 1 produces 70% ethane and butanes, with 20% methane.

5. Reduced hydrogenolysis: Catalyst 6 exhibits lower hydrogenolysis activity compared to catalyst 1, with the initial rate of propane hydrogenolysis being about 5 times lower. This reduced side reaction likely contributes to the improved overall performance and selectivity of catalyst 6.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although the specific details are not provided in the given excerpts. The one-site mechanism would involve the formation and transformation of metallacyclobutane intermediates on a single tantalum center, while the two-site mechanism would involve the cooperation of two tantalum centers in the redistribution process.

The improved performance of catalyst 6 can be attributed to its modified coordination environment, which likely stabilizes the active species and promotes the desired metathesis pathway over competing reactions like hydrogenolysis. This results in higher selectivity for the desired alkane homologues and improved catalyst longevity.

烷烃复分解反应由硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化的机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 烷烃同系物重新分配：催化剂将给定的烷烃转化为其较低和较高的同系物。这一过程允许将直链烷烃转化为更短和更长链的烷烃。

2. 钽的低配位：通过保持钽中心周围的低配位环境来优化催化性能。这是通过将钽接枝到金属氢氧化物上实现的，有助于维持金属中心所需的电子缺陷。

3. 关键中间体的形成：虽然在给定的摘录中没有明确提及，但烷烃复分解通常涉及烯烃中间体和金属环丁烷物种的形成。这些中间体对于烷烃链中碳原子的重新分配至关重要。

4. 选择性：与硅胶负载的钽氢化物（催化剂1）相比，氧化锆氢氧化物支持的钽氢化物催化剂（催化剂6）对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物表现出更好的选择性。具体来说，催化剂6产生80%的乙烷和丁烷，仅10%的甲烷，而催化剂1产生70%的乙烷和丁烷，20%的甲烷。

5. 减少氢解：与催化剂1相比，催化剂6表现出较低的氢解活性，丙烷氢解的初始速率约为前者的1/5。这种副反应的减少可能有助于催化剂6的整体性能和选择性的改善。

该机理可能涉及单位点和双位点途径，尽管在给定的摘录中没有提供具体细节。单位点机制将涉及在单个钽中心上形成和转化金属环丁烷中间体，而双位点机制将涉及两个钽中心在重新分配过程中的协同作用。

催化剂6性能的改善可归因于其改进的配位环境，这可能稳定了活性物种并促进了所需的复分解途径，而不是竞争反应如氢解。这导致了对所需烷烃同系物的更高选择性和改善的催化剂寿命。
