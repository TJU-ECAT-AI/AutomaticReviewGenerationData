The disproportionation 
of alkanes 
wvas carried 
out over 
a dual-functional 
catalyst 
comprising 
platinum-on-alumina 
mixed 
with 
tungsten 
oxide-on-silica. 
The 
reaction 
involves 
formation 
of low concentrations 
of olefinic 
intermediates 
over a dehydrogena- 
tion catalyst 
followed 
by disproportionation 
of these olefins over a disproportionat,ion 
catalyst. 
Product 
olefins are rehydrogenated 
to the corresponding 
paraffins. 
A series of 
layered 
bed experiments 
involving 
the individual 
cat,alyst components 
was performed 
to 
confirm 
this sequence of reactions. 
Because a complex mixture 
of reacting 
species and 
products 
is generated 
from a single reactant 
and cross reactions 
occur between 
different 
classes of hydrocarbons, 
t,he overall 
process is termed 
molecular 
redistribution 
rather 
than simply 
disproportionation 
(1). 
In this system, 
straight-chain 
alkanes 
are more reactive 
than branched, 
with 
pure 
isobutane 
being 
only 
slightly 
reactive. 
With 
mixtures 
of n-butane 
and isobutane, 
the former 
reacts not only with itself but also with isobutane, 
in which 
case isopentane 
is a major product. 
The molecular 
redistribution 
catalyst 
system is extremely 
sensit.ive to poisoning 
by 
impurities, 
and the catalyst 
must be protected 
by a suitable 
guard chamber in the feed 
line. An excess of either olefins or hydrogen 
over the low concentrations 
formed as reac- 
tion 
intermediates 
inhibits 
the reaction. 
Catalyst 
stability 
increases 
with 
decreasing 
temperature 
and wit.h increasing 
pressure 
and is also influenced 
by the ratio 
of the 
two catalyst 
components. 
The intriguing 
reaction of disproportiona- 
tion of olefins first introduced by Banks and 
Bailey (2) in 1964 has prompted much work 
concerning 
applications 
and 
mechanistic 
studies (3-11). In this reaction, linear olefins 
are converted 
to homologs of shorter and 
longer carbon chains. It has since been dis- 
covered that use of dual-functional 
catalysts 
combining 
dehydrogenation 
and 
dispro- 
portionation 
components allows for a series 
of alkane disproportionation 
reactions in a 
one-reactor 
system. Another 
combination 
catalyst system for t.his type of reaction was 
disclosed by Heckelsberg and Banks (la). 
The 
experiments 
of 
Heckelsberg 
and 
Banks 
were performed 
with 
a tungsten 
oxide-on-silica 
catalyst 
mixed with 
several 
different deh ydrogenation 
components such 
as chromia-alumina. 
At 
527 to 607C, 
where olefin and hydrogen 
concentrations 
become appreciable, propane was converted 
with formation 
of heavier ,olefins and paraf- 
fins. Propylene 
was a principal 
product, 
and large amounts of cracked products were 
formed. 
The work described in the present paper 
was carried 
out largely 
at t,emperatures 
below 425C under 
conditions 
restricting 
olefin 
and hydrogen 
content 
of reacting 
streams t,o very low levels. Skeletal isom- 
erization 
and 
cracking 
do not 
occur to 
any appreciable 
extent 
at these tempera- 
tures, and catalyst 
stability 
is better than 
at higher temperatures.

extensive data on catalyst stability,

EXPERIMENTAL 
METHODS 
I. Catalysts 
Tungsten 
oxide 
on silica 
gel catalysts 
comprised the disproportionation 
component 
and were prepared 
by 
impregnation 
of 
Davison 
Grade 70 silica gel with 
aqueous 
solutions of ammonium tungstate. 
This was 
followed 
by air calcination 
at 540C and 
reduction in hydrogen at 540C. 
oxygen at both 370 and 48OC, successively; 
and reducing with hydrogen at 480C. This 
treatment 
was so successful in establishing 
reproducible 
initial 
catalyst 
activity 
after 
repeated regeneration cycles that it became 
a standard procedure to treat a fresh charge 
of catalyst in this manner as well. In order 
to get the unit up to pressure at the begin- 
ning of a run, the reactor was pressurized 
initially 
with either Nz or Hz; and this gas 
was then slowly purged from the catalyst 
by the feed as the latter was introduced. 
RESULTS 
AND 
DISCUSSION 
The dehydrogenation 
catalyst component 
was prepared by impregnation 
of a gamma- 
alumina having a BET specific surface area 
of 207 mZ/g with 
an aqueous solution 
of 
Pt(NH&(NO& 
and LiN03. 
Calcination 
in 
air at 540C was followed by reduction 
in 
hydrogen at 480C.

Apparatus and Procedure 
The disproportionation 
and dehydrogena- 
tion catalysts were ground to a particle size 
of 0.25-0.65 
mm 
and 
mixed. 
Catalyst 
charges of 5 cc were loaded into a 0.95-cm 
316 stainless 
steel tube 
mounted 
in an 
electric 
furnace. 
The reactor temperature 
was controlled 
to within 
1C. Volumetric 
ratio of catalyst components was either 2 : 
7 
or 4:5 Pt catalyst: WOs catalyst. 
When n-butane 
is the sole react.ant, a 
typical 
product 
distribution 
is as repre- 
sented in the first 
column 
of Table 
1. 
n-Paraffins 
are the predominant 
products, 
as predicted 
by the mechanistic 
theory 
of 
olefin disproportionation 
(4, S). While the 
dual site mechanism is proven below, it is

Instrument-grade

and were 
pumped through the reactor with a constant

was depressurized through 
a pneumatically

helpful 
here to consider 
the reaction 
to 
occur as indicated in Fig. 1. The wide boil- 
ing range of the products obtained may be 
explained 
by secondary disproportionation 
reactions 
of the primary 
products. 
Since 
all isomeric straight-chain 
olefins may be 
generated by the dehydrogenation 
catalyst 
component, the specificity 
experienced with 
olefins over a nonacidic 
disproportionation 
catalyst 
(4, 8) is not obtained 
with 
the 
alkane molecular redistribution 
system. 
B. Catalyst Stability 
The decline of alkane disproportionation 
activity 
with time at constant temperature 
usually 
approximates 
closely a linear semi- 
logarithmic 
relationship 
(1). The slope of 
this line, d log c/d 
[where c is conversion 
of feed (To) and t is time (hr)], can be used 
as a measure of catalyst stability. 
The con- 
version extrapolated 
to zero time gives a 
measure of initial 
catalyst activity. 
There is 
a marked temperature 
dependency 
of the 
fouling 
rate as shown in Fig. 2. For this 
reason, the reaction 
temperature 
is best 
kept below about 400 to 425C. 
C. Catalyst Activity 
The catalyst activity 
as defined by initial 
conversion is shown in Fig. 2 to increase 
with 
temperature 
up to about 425C. At 
higher temperatures, 
conversion 
ceases to 
increase; and the yield of liquid 
products

falls off, again making it desirable to stay 
below about 425C. 
D. Mixtures 
of Iso- and n-Butane 
Mixtures 
of isobutane and n-butane were 
contacted with a Pt-Li/AlzOs 
+ 16% WOa/ 
SiOZ catalyst (4:5 ratio) at 399C 62.2 atm, 
and 1.0 LHSV. Table 1 compares the product 
distributions 
for n-butane by itself and in a 
71:29 mixture 
with isobutane. 
These data 
show that appreciable quantities of both iso- 
mers have reacted, producing both branched 
and straight-chain 
products. 
Figure 
3 brings 
out the fact that 
the 
reactivity 
of *butane 
is only slightly 
de- 
creased as the feed isobutane 
concentra- 
tion increases to 70 wt %. An appreciable 
fraction 
of isobutane 
reacts when a large 
excess of n-butane 
is present. As the con- 
centration 
of isobutane in the feed increases, 
its reactivity 
decreases much more rapidly 
than that of n-butane. 
However, 
the reac- 
tivity 
of isobutane with itself is still finite in 
the absence of n-butane. 
II. 
Reaction Mechanism 
A. Layered Bed Experiments 
It was desired to learn whether the prod- 
ucts of the molecular redistribution 
reaction 
could be explained by a stepwise mechanistic 
theory as in Fig. 1, or whether some other 
mechanism 
such 
as one involving 
free 
radical 
intermediates 
or direct 
dispropor- 
tionation 
over the Pt catalyst 
(13) without 
participation 
of the WOJ$!+iO, might 
pre- 
vail. To this end, a set of experiments was 
devised to allow the various steps to occur, 
one at a time. 
Four 
catalyst 
beds were 
employed : Pt catalyst 
only, WO, catalyst 
only, Pt-WOB, and Pt-WOs-Pt. 
When more 
than one catalyst component was employed, 
it was in a layer separated by 2.5 cm from 
the next catalyst component. A pressure of 
4.4 atm rather than 62.2 atm was employed 
in order to make the linear 
gas velocity 
through 
the reactor 
sufficiently 
great to 
make back diffusion effects negligible. 
Table 2 summarizes the product distribu- 
tion over these four catalyst beds. Over the 
Pt catalyst alone, dehydrogenation 
of n-bu- 
tane to butenes is the main reaction. A small 
amount of hydrogenolysis 
also occurred and 
is backed out of the data for the other 
catalyst combinations. 
WO3/SiO2 alone did 
nothing. 
When a layer of WOa catalyst was 
placed beneath the Pt, about half of the 
butenes were disproportionated 
to Ca and 
lighter 
and to Cg and heavier 
products. 
Olefins were the predominant 
non-C1 species, 
rather than the corresponding 
alkanes. Still 
another 
layer 
of Pt following 
the WOa 
catalyst hydrogenated 
the olefinic products 
to the corresponding 
alkanes and reestab-

These results prove that olefinic intermedi-

and that both the Pt and 
WOS components are required, 
not merely

In the same manner as with the n-butane 
feed, a set of layered bed experiments was 
carried out with a feed consisting of 2.7% 
propylene :in n-butane.

The latter set of layered bed experiments 
also helped to show which 
catalyst

of 
the 
molecular 
redistribution 
catalyst 
system. When only the Pt com-

Most

experiments 
were conducted over a catalyst system com-

WO,/SiO,. 
Since fouling 
seemed to occur 
more as a result 
of deterioration 
of Pt 
activit.y rather than WOa activity, 
consecu- 
tive 
runs were made with 
2 :7 and 4: 5

ratios 
of Pt: WOO catalyst

ate product 
olefins to be primarily 
respon- 
sible for the overall observed fouling of the 
catalyst system for the following 
reasons: 
1. It has been shown in a separate paper 
(1) that combinations 
of WO@iO, 
with a 
variety 
of 
dehydrogenation 
components 
have butane redistribution 
activity 
but that 
deactivation 
rates with 
different 
dehydro- 
genation 
components 
show 
loo-fold 
dif- 
ferences. 
From 
this, 
one may 
conclude 
either that the dehydrogenation 
components 
deactivate at very different rates or that they 
give off drastically 
different amounts of sub- 
stances that poison the WOa/SiOp catalyst. 
2. Increasing 
the ratio 
of Pt: WOS im- 
proves 
catalyst 
stability. 
If 
the 
dehy- 
drogenation 
component 
were causing de- 
activation 
of the WOs/SiOz by giving 
off 
poisons, more Pt would 
increase the de- 
activation 
rate 
rather 
than 
decrease it. 
Therefore, the dehydrogenation 
component 
is the 
one which 
is deactivating 
more 
rapidly. 
3. As the catalyst 
deactivates, 
the ratio 
of butene 
to butane 
increases 
(Fig. 
5). 
Moreover, 
the more stable 4: 5 Pt : 
WOs 
system has a lower 
butene: butane 
ratio 
than the 2:7 system. These results are the 
opposite of those expected if dehydrogena- 
tion activity 
were rate limiting 
and its loss 
were responsible for deactivation 
of the re- 
distribution 
reaction. 
Therefore, 
deactiva- 
tion 
involves 
a decrease in activity 
for 
hydrogenation 
of product oleflns. 
Both hydrogenation 
and dehydrogenation 
activities 
of the Pt catalyst 
must decrease 
as it deactivates. The reason that the loss of 
molecular redistribution 
activity 
involves 
a 
decrease in hydrogenation 
rather than de- 
hydrogenation 
activity 
is probably 
related 
to mass action considerations. 
The concen- 
trations 
of the alkanes reacting in the de- 
hydrogenation 
step are much higher than 
the very small concentrations 
of the product 
olefins reacting 
in the hydrogenation 
step 
(Fig. 1).

E. Excess of Olejin or Hydrogen 
In considering the effects of added olefin

The fact that the molecular redistribution 
of 
n-butane 
proceeds through 
this sequence 
was demonstrated 
by 
the 
layered 
bed 
experiments. 
Early in the present study, experiments 
were undertaken 
in which 
propylene 
was 
added with 
the 
n-butane 
reactant. 
We 
expected that the rate of butane dispropor- 
tionation 
might thereby 
be increased; this 
could occur if Reactions 1 and 3 were very 
rapid and Reaction 
2 limited 
t,he rate of 
overall butane redistribution. 
Results of the 
olefin addition experiments were contrary to 
this expectation. 
An excess of olefin over the amount gen- 
erated from the reactant 
alkane by the 
dehydrogenation 
catalyst 
was found to be 
detrimental 
to redistribution 
activity. 
Figure 
11 plots the effect of various 
amount,s of 
added propylene 
relative 
to the case in 
which no olefin is added. The olefin tolerance 
is somewhat greater at higher catalyst tem- 
perature. Most of the butane redisbribubion 
activity 
was restored if the added propylene 
was removed from the butane feed within 
a 
few hours. Longer exposure of the catalyst 
to excess olefin produced last.ing deactiva- 
tion, recovery from which required oxidative 
removal of coke from the catalyst,. The re- 
mainder 
of this 
discussion 
is concerned 
solely with the reversible inhibit,ion. 
With 6% propylene in the butane feed at 
343C, essentially no redistribution 
of n-bu- 
tane was observed. Hydrogenation 
of pro- 
pylene 
did not 
occur to an appreciable 
extent, but propylene was disproportionated 
to about an equilibrium 
mixture of olefins. 
Under 
t.hese condit.ions, 
the excess olefin 
had completely 
deactivated 
the Pt eom- 
ponent but had left the WO, component 
fully active. The effect of a smaller amount 
of added propylene 
(2.7%) 
at a higher 
temperature 
(399C) may be seen by com- 
paring the dat,a of Tables 2 and 3. In those 
experiments 
in which t.hc reactant 
passed 
over a layer of Pt> last, t.he product 
(pro- 
pylene/propane) 
: (butene/butane) 
rat8io was 
much 
larger 
than 
the equilibrium 
value 
when 
excess olefin 
was added with 
the 
butane feed. An appreciable amount, of net 
hydrogen transfer from butane to the added 
propylene did occur under t,hese condit.ions. 
However, the hydrogen 
transfer 
ability 
of 
the Pt catalyst was sufficiently 
lowered by 
the presence of excess olefin 
t)o prevent.

The inhibition 
of molecular redistribution 
by excess olefin involves 
one or more reac- 
tions catalyzed by the Pt, rather than the 
olefin disproportionation 
reaction catalyzed 
by the WO,/SiO,. 
The inhibition 
may in- 
volve either a simple, mass action effect on 
the olefin hydrogenation 
step, or a decrease 
in the activity 
of the Pt catalyst for paraffin 
dehydrogenation. 
In the former case, deple- 
tion of the Hz to a very low concentration 
by reaction with the excess propylene may 
cause 
Reaction 
3 to become rate limiting. 
In the latter 
case, the activity 
of the Pt 
for Reaction 
1 may be decreased in either 
of two ways. Strong adsorption of the excess 
olefin may block Pt sites active for paraffin 
dehydrogenation. 
Alternatively, 
depletion of 
chemisorbed hydrogen on the Pt surface by 
reaction with excess olefin may render the 
Pt ineffective 
for paraffin dehydrogenation. 
That the latter may be a possibility 
is sug- 
gested by the work 
of Wood (14), who 
reported 
the 
presence 
of 
dissociatively 
adsorbed hydrogen 
on a Pd surface neces- 
sary in order for cyclohexane dehydrogena- 
tion to occur. 
Excess hydrogen added with the reactant 
alkane 
also inhibited 
the 
redistribution 
reaction. Data on the effect of added hydro- 
gen are given in Table 4, where 32 mole To 
of Hz was added to the n-butane 
feed. 
Redistribution 
activity 
decreased markedly, 
probably 
by a mass action effect through 
Reaction 
1. Hydrogenolysis 
activity 
in- 
creased, as evidenced by increased methane 
production. 
The effect of added Hz was 
reversible, 
for redistribution 
activity 
and 
selectivity 
were largely 
recovered 
within 
1.15 hr after addition 
of Hz was stopped 
(Table 4).
