Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

The given literature does not contain any information to answer the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text appears to be a bibliographic citation for an article, but does not include the actual content of the article. Without access to the full text, it is not possible to analyze the comprehensive mechanism, discuss two-site and one-site schemes, describe processes involved in alkane transformations, explain the formation and role of key intermediates, or evaluate how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

Unfortunately, there is no relevant information in the given literature to answer the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The provided text appears to be only a title and author list for a scientific article, without any content about the actual mechanisms, processes, or intermediates involved in alkane metathesis. To properly address this question, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional sources that discuss the specific details of alkane metathesis reactions and catalysts.
