[1] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

[2] "It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

[3] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

[4] "Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. CH Activation: The process begins with the activation of CH bonds in alkanes, forming an alkyl species on the catalyst surface.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, resulting in the formation of olefins or hydridocarbene intermediates. These serve as the necessary propagating centers for olefin metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to yield the alkane metathesis products.

This mechanism represents a one-site scheme, as the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst performs all necessary functions (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) on a single metal center. This is in contrast to two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction is primarily towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. This selectivity arises from the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds of alkanes (Cn-1).

The catalyst's ability to perform all necessary steps on a single metal center contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions. Notably, these catalytic systems can incorporate methane into higher homologues, demonstrating their versatility in alkane transformations.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the differences between linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism suggests that the process could potentially accommodate both types of alkanes, as long as CH activation and subsequent steps can occur.

The formation of key intermediates like olefins and metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role in the overall process. Olefins serve as the substrate for metathesis, while metallacyclobutanes are likely involved in the [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion steps of the metathesis process.

In summary, the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst offers a unique one-site approach to alkane metathesis, combining multiple catalytic functions to achieve selective transformation of alkanes into their homologues.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. CH活化：过程始于烷烃中CH键的活化，在催化剂表面形成烷基物种。

2. 脱氢：烷基物种经历β-H或α-H转移，生成烯烃或氢化物卡宾中间体。这些作为烯烃复分解所需的传播中心。

3. 烯烃复分解：关键的碳-碳键断裂和键形成步骤通过[2+2]环反转和环加成进行，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。这可能涉及金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

4. 加氢：最后一步涉及复分解产物的加氢，得到烷烃复分解产物。

这种机理代表了一个单点方案，因为二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂在单一金属中心上执行所有必要的功能（CH活化、脱氢、复分解和加氢）。这与像Chevron过程这样的双点方案不同，后者使用单独的催化剂进行脱氢/加氢和复分解。

反应的选择性主要倾向于Cn-1和Cn+1同系物。这种选择性源于主要路径，即终端烯烃（Cn-2）与由烷烃终端CH键活化形成的烷基化合物（Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。

催化剂在单一金属中心上执行所有必要步骤的能力有助于其在各种烷烃转化中的性能。值得注意的是，这些催化系统可以将甲烷并入更高的同系物中，展示了它们在烷烃转化中的多功能性。

虽然文献没有明确讨论线性和环状烷烃转化之间的差异，但该机理表明，只要能发生CH活化和后续步骤，该过程可能适用于这两种类型的烷烃。

关键中间体如烯烃和金属环丁烷的形成在整个过程中起着至关重要的作用。烯烃作为复分解的底物，而金属环丁烷可能参与复分解过程中的[2+2]环加成和环反转步骤。

总之，二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂为烷烃复分解提供了一种独特的单点方法，结合多种催化功能，实现烷烃向其同系物的选择性转化。
