<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. C-H Activation: The catalyst first activates the C-H bond of the alkane, forming an alkyl species on the metal center.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, yielding either an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. This step is crucial for generating the necessary species for metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

The catalyst operates as a single-site system, with one metal center capable of performing all necessary functions: C-H activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This contrasts with two-site systems like the Chevron process, which use separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. This selectivity arises from the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal C-H bonds of alkanes (Cn-1).

The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues suggests it can effectively activate and transform even the shortest alkanes. This versatility allows for a wide range of alkane conversions, including both linear and potentially cyclic alkanes, although the text doesn't specifically mention cyclic alkane transformations.

The performance and efficiency of the catalyst are likely influenced by its ability to balance these various processes and maintain active sites for each step of the reaction. Factors such as the support material (silica in this case), the nature of the metal-support interaction, and reaction conditions would all play roles in determining overall catalyst performance and longevity.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. C-H活化：催化剂首先活化烷烃的C-H键，在金属中心形成烷基物种。

2. 脱氢：烷基物种经历β-H或α-H转移，产生烯烃或氢化卡宾中间体。这一步对于产生复分解所需的物种至关重要。

3. 烯烃复分解：关键的碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤通过[2+2]环反转和环加成进行，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。这可能涉及金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

4. 氢化：最后一步涉及复分解产物的氢化，形成新的烷烃。

催化剂作为单一位点系统运作，一个金属中心能够执行所有必要的功能：C-H活化、脱氢、复分解和氢化。这与像Chevron过程这样的双位点系统形成对比，后者使用单独的催化剂进行脱氢/氢化和复分解。

反应对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物表现出选择性。这种选择性源于主要路径涉及终端烯烃（Cn-2）和由烷烃终端C-H键活化形成的烷基烯物种（Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。

催化剂将甲烷并入更高同系物的能力表明它可以有效地活化和转化最短的烷烃。这种多功能性允许广泛的烷烃转化，包括直链和可能的环烷烃，尽管文本没有特别提到环烷烃的转化。

催化剂的性能和效率可能受到其平衡这些不同过程并为反应的每个步骤保持活性位点能力的影响。诸如支撑材料（在这种情况下是硅胶）、金属-支撑物相互作用的性质以及反应条件等因素都会在决定整体催化剂性能和寿命方面发挥作用。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps that combine aspects of both two-site and one-site schemes. The process begins with CH activation of alkanes to form an alkyl species. This alkyl species then undergoes either β-H or α-H transfer, resulting in the formation of an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, respectively. The hydridocarbene intermediate serves as the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis.

The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps in this process mirror those of olefin metathesis, involving a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition step. This likely leads to the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.

One of the unique aspects of this catalytic system is that it utilizes a single metal center that possesses all the necessary properties for the complete transformation: CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This contrasts with other systems like the Chevron process, which requires separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues is attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between a terminal olefin (R=Cn-2) and an alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn-1). This selectivity is a key factor in the catalyst's performance, allowing for more controlled alkane conversions.

The versatility of these catalytic systems is further demonstrated by their ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues, expanding their potential applications in alkane conversions.

While the text doesn't provide specific information on the processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations, it can be inferred that similar mechanisms would apply, with additional considerations for ring strain and conformational changes.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a intricate interplay of CH activation, dehydrogenation, olefin formation, metathesis, and hydrogenation steps. The single-metal, multi-function nature of the catalyst, combined with its selectivity towards specific homologues, contributes to its unique performance in alkane conversions.

反应对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物的选择性归因于主要路径涉及端烯烃（R=Cn-2）与烷烃端CH键活化产生的烯烃基物种（R=Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。这种选择性是催化剂性能的关键因素，允许更受控制的烷烃转化。

这些催化体系的多功能性进一步体现在它们能够将甲烷并入更高的同系物中，扩大了它们在烷烃转化中的潜在应用。

虽然文本没有提供环烷烃转化过程的具体信息，但可以推断类似的机理也适用，同时还需考虑环张力和构象变化等额外因素。

总之，由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理涉及CH活化、脱氢、烯烃形成、复分解和加氢步骤的复杂相互作用。催化剂的单金属、多功能性质，结合其对特定同系物的选择性，促成了其在烷烃转化中的独特性能。

This is in contrast to two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction is primarily towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. This selectivity arises from the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds of alkanes (Cn-1).

The catalyst's ability to perform all necessary steps on a single metal center contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions. Notably, these catalytic systems can incorporate methane into higher homologues, demonstrating their versatility in alkane transformations.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the differences between linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism suggests that the process could potentially accommodate both types of alkanes, as long as CH activation and subsequent steps can occur.

The formation of key intermediates like olefins and metallacyclobutanes plays a crucial role in the overall process. Olefins serve as the substrate for metathesis, while metallacyclobutanes are likely involved in the [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion steps of the metathesis process.

In summary, the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst offers a unique one-site approach to alkane metathesis, combining multiple catalytic functions to achieve selective transformation of alkanes into their homologues.
