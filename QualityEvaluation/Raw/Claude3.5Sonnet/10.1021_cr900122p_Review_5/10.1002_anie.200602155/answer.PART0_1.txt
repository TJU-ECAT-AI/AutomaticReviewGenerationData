[1] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

[2] "It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

[3] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

[4] "Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps that combine aspects of both two-site and one-site schemes. The process begins with CH activation of alkanes to form an alkyl species. This alkyl species then undergoes either β-H or α-H transfer, resulting in the formation of an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, respectively. The hydridocarbene intermediate serves as the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis.

The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps in this process mirror those of olefin metathesis, involving a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition step. This likely leads to the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.

One of the unique aspects of this catalytic system is that it utilizes a single metal center that possesses all the necessary properties for the complete transformation: CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This contrasts with other systems like the Chevron process, which requires separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues is attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between a terminal olefin (R=Cn-2) and an alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn-1). This selectivity is a key factor in the catalyst's performance, allowing for more controlled alkane conversions.

The versatility of these catalytic systems is further demonstrated by their ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues, expanding their potential applications in alkane conversions.

While the text doesn't provide specific information on the processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations, it can be inferred that similar mechanisms would apply, with additional considerations for ring strain and conformational changes.

In summary, the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a intricate interplay of CH activation, dehydrogenation, olefin formation, metathesis, and hydrogenation steps. The single-metal, multi-function nature of the catalyst, combined with its selectivity towards specific homologues, contributes to its unique performance in alkane conversions.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及一系列复杂的步骤，结合了双位点和单位点方案的特点。该过程始于烷烃的CH活化，形成烷基物种。这种烷基物种随后经历β-H或α-H转移，分别生成烯烃或氢化卡宾中间体。氢化卡宾中间体作为烯烃复分解所需的传播中心。

这个过程中的关键碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤类似于烯烃复分解，涉及[2+2]环反转和环加成步骤。这可能导致金属环丁烷中间体的形成，尽管在给定的文本中没有明确提到。

这种催化体系的独特之处在于它利用单一金属中心具备完成整个转化所需的所有性质：CH活化、脱氢、复分解和加氢。这与其他系统（如Chevron过程）形成对比，后者需要单独的催化剂进行脱氢/加氢和复分解。

反应对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物的选择性归因于主要路径涉及端烯烃（R=Cn-2）与烷烃端CH键活化产生的烯烃基物种（R=Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。这种选择性是催化剂性能的关键因素，允许更受控制的烷烃转化。

这些催化体系的多功能性进一步体现在它们能够将甲烷并入更高的同系物中，扩大了它们在烷烃转化中的潜在应用。

虽然文本没有提供环烷烃转化过程的具体信息，但可以推断类似的机理也适用，同时还需考虑环张力和构象变化等额外因素。

总之，由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理涉及CH活化、脱氢、烯烃形成、复分解和加氢步骤的复杂相互作用。催化剂的单金属、多功能性质，结合其对特定同系物的选择性，促成了其在烷烃转化中的独特性能。
