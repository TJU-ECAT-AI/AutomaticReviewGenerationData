[1] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

[2] "It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c)."

[3] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

[4] "Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. C-H Activation: The catalyst first activates the C-H bond of the alkane, forming an alkyl species on the metal center.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, yielding either an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. This step is crucial for generating the necessary species for metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

The catalyst operates as a single-site system, with one metal center capable of performing all necessary functions: C-H activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This contrasts with two-site systems like the Chevron process, which use separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. This selectivity arises from the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal C-H bonds of alkanes (Cn-1).

The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues suggests it can effectively activate and transform even the shortest alkanes. This versatility allows for a wide range of alkane conversions, including both linear and potentially cyclic alkanes, although the text doesn't specifically mention cyclic alkane transformations.

The performance and efficiency of the catalyst are likely influenced by its ability to balance these various processes and maintain active sites for each step of the reaction. Factors such as the support material (silica in this case), the nature of the metal-support interaction, and reaction conditions would all play roles in determining overall catalyst performance and longevity.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. C-H活化：催化剂首先活化烷烃的C-H键，在金属中心形成烷基物种。

2. 脱氢：烷基物种经历β-H或α-H转移，产生烯烃或氢化卡宾中间体。这一步对于产生复分解所需的物种至关重要。

3. 烯烃复分解：关键的碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤通过[2+2]环反转和环加成进行，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。这可能涉及金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

4. 氢化：最后一步涉及复分解产物的氢化，形成新的烷烃。

催化剂作为单一位点系统运作，一个金属中心能够执行所有必要的功能：C-H活化、脱氢、复分解和氢化。这与像Chevron过程这样的双位点系统形成对比，后者使用单独的催化剂进行脱氢/氢化和复分解。

反应对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物表现出选择性。这种选择性源于主要路径涉及终端烯烃（Cn-2）和由烷烃终端C-H键活化形成的烷基烯物种（Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。

催化剂将甲烷并入更高同系物的能力表明它可以有效地活化和转化最短的烷烃。这种多功能性允许广泛的烷烃转化，包括直链和可能的环烷烃，尽管文本没有特别提到环烷烃的转化。

催化剂的性能和效率可能受到其平衡这些不同过程并为反应的每个步骤保持活性位点能力的影响。诸如支撑材料（在这种情况下是硅胶）、金属-支撑物相互作用的性质以及反应条件等因素都会在决定整体催化剂性能和寿命方面发挥作用。
