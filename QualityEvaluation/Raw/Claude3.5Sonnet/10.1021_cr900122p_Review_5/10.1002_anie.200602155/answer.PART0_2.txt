[1] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

[2] "It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

[3] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

[4] "Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. C-H Activation: The process begins with the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes, forming an alkyl species on the catalyst surface.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, yielding either an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. This step is crucial for generating the necessary species for olefin metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

The system operates as a dual catalyst, with a single metal center performing all necessary functions: C-H activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This contrasts with two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction favors the formation of Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues. This is due to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal C-H bonds in alkanes (Cn-1).

The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues demonstrates its versatility in alkane conversions. However, the literature does not provide specific details on the mechanisms for cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The performance and selectivity of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by its ability to carry out all necessary steps on a single metal center, as well as its preference for activating terminal C-H bonds and forming specific olefin intermediates.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. C-H活化：该过程始于烷烃C-H键的活化，在催化剂表面形成烷基物种。

2. 脱氢：烷基物种经历β-H或α-H转移，产生烯烃或氢化碳烯中间体。这一步对于生成烯烃复分解所需的物种至关重要。

3. 烯烃复分解：关键的碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤通过[2+2]环反转和环加成机制进行，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。这可能涉及金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

4. 氢化：最后一步涉及复分解产物的氢化，形成新的烷烃。

该系统作为双功能催化剂运作，单一金属中心执行所有必要功能：C-H活化、脱氢、复分解和氢化。这与像Chevron过程这样的双位点方案形成对比，后者使用单独的催化剂进行脱氢/氢化和复分解。

反应的选择性有利于形成Cn-1和Cn+1同系物。这是由于主要途径涉及端烯烃（Cn-2）与由烷烃端C-H键活化形成的烷基碳烯物种（Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。

催化剂将甲烷掺入更高同系物的能力展示了其在烷烃转化中的多功能性。然而，文献并未提供环烷烃转化机制或金属环丁烷中间体形成的具体细节。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和选择性受其在单一金属中心上执行所有必要步骤的能力的影响，以及其对活化端C-H键和形成特定烯烃中间体的偏好。
