[1] "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

[2] "It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

[3] "Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

[4] "Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. CH Activation: The process begins with the activation of CH bonds in alkanes, forming an alkyl species on the catalyst surface.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, resulting in the formation of olefins or hydridocarbene intermediates. These are crucial for the subsequent metathesis steps.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

The catalyst system is unique in that it uses a single metal center to perform all necessary functions: CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation. This contrasts with two-site systems like the Chevron process, which use separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues is attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds in alkanes. This selectivity differentiates the silica-supported tantalum hydride system from other alkane metathesis catalysts.

The ability of these catalysts to incorporate methane into higher homologues suggests they can effectively activate and transform even the shortest alkanes. This feature enhances their versatility in various alkane conversion processes.

While the document doesn't provide specific details on the transformation of cyclic alkanes, the general mechanism should apply to both linear and cyclic systems, with potential differences in reactivity and selectivity based on structural constraints.

The performance and efficiency of these catalysts in various alkane conversions likely depend on their ability to balance the rates of each step in the catalytic cycle, maintain active sites, and resist deactivation under reaction conditions. However, the document doesn't provide specific performance metrics for different alkane substrates.

二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键步骤和过程：

1. CH活化：该过程始于烷烃中CH键的活化，在催化剂表面形成烷基物种。

2. 脱氢：烷基物种经历β-H或α-H转移，生成烯烃或氢化物卡宾中间体。这些对后续的复分解步骤至关重要。

3. 烯烃复分解：关键的碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤通过[2+2]环加成和环断裂机制进行，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。这可能涉及金属杂环丁烷中间体的形成。

4. 氢化：最后一步涉及复分解产物的氢化，形成新的烷烃。

该催化剂体系的独特之处在于它使用单一金属中心执行所有必要功能：CH活化、脱氢、复分解和氢化。这与Chevron过程等双位点系统形成对比，后者使用单独的催化剂进行脱氢/氢化和复分解。

反应对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物的选择性归因于主要途径，即端烯烃与由烷烃端CH键活化形成的烯叉基物种之间的交叉复分解。这种选择性使二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物系统与其他烷烃复分解催化剂区分开来。

这些催化剂能够将甲烷并入更高的同系物，表明它们可以有效地活化和转化最短的烷烃。这一特性增强了它们在各种烷烃转化过程中的多功能性。

虽然文档没有提供环烷烃转化的具体细节，但一般机理应适用于直链和环状系统，基于结构限制可能在反应性和选择性上存在潜在差异。

这些催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和效率可能取决于它们平衡催化循环中每个步骤速率、维持活性位点以及在反应条件下抗失活的能力。然而，文档没有提供不同烷烃底物的具体性能指标。
