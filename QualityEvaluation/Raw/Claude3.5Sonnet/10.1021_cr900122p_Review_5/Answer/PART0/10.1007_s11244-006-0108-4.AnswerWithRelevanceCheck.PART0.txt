          "Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

"Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

"Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

"The ratio of linear to branched products is due to the relative amount of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the initial CH bond activation step [11,12]."

"Concerning the selectivities of the reaction obtained with the various hydrides (figure 5), it turns out that tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones; in particular, a smaller amount of methane and pentanes is formed. Both these products come from the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane, which should be less favoured with tungsten than tantalum (scheme 2)."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: 
   a) Carbene hydride species form through α-H abstraction
   b) Olefin hydride species form through β-H abstraction
   These are crucial intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The carbene and olefin intermediates interact to form a tantallacyclobutane. This step is analogous to the mechanism in olefin metathesis.

4. Metallacycle decomposition: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin.

5. Product formation: Hydrogenation of the new olefins produces new alkanes.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur on a single tantalum center. In a two-site scheme, different tantalum centers may be involved in the various steps, such as C-H activation, olefin formation, and metathesis.

For linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the basic steps remain the same, but the specific intermediates and product distributions may differ. Cyclic alkanes may form more complex metallacycles.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins then participate in further reactions, leading to the redistribution of carbon chains characteristic of alkane metathesis.

Key factors influencing reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include:

1. The [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates govern product selectivity.

2. The ratio of linear to branched products is determined by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H bond activation step.

3. The choice of metal (tantalum vs. tungsten) affects product distribution. Tungsten-based catalysts generally produce a narrower distribution of products compared to tantalum-based catalysts.

4. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, which can vary depending on the metal and substituents.

5. The efficiency of C-H bond activation, olefin formation, and hydrogenation steps.

These factors can vary depending on the specific alkane substrate, reaction conditions, and catalyst structure, leading to differences in activity and selectivity across different alkane conversions.

          由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理包括几个关键步骤和过程：

1. 引发：反应始于钽氢化物对烷烃的C-H键活化，形成表面钽烷基络合物。

2. 关键中间体的形成：
   a) 通过α-H消除形成卡宾氢化物物种
   b) 通过β-H消除形成烯烃氢化物物种
   这些是催化循环中的关键中间体。

3. 金属杂环丁烷形成：卡宾和烯烃中间体相互作用形成钽杂环丁烷。这一步类似于烯烃复分解的机理。

4. 金属环分解：钽杂环丁烷分解产生新的卡宾和新的烯烃。

5. 产物形成：新烯烃的氢化产生新的烷烃。

这种机理支持单位点和双位点方案。在单位点方案中，所有步骤都发生在单个钽中心上。在双位点方案中，不同的钽中心可能参与各种步骤，如C-H活化、烯烃形成和复分解。

对于直链和环状烷烃转化，基本步骤保持不变，但具体的中间体和产物分布可能有所不同。环状烷烃可能形成更复杂的金属环。

烯烃作为初级产物的形成，以及氢气的产生，对整个复分解过程至关重要。这些烯烃随后参与进一步的反应，导致烷烃复分解特有的碳链重新分配。

影响反应选择性和催化剂性能的关键因素包括：

1. 金属杂环丁烷中间体中甲基或乙基取代基的[1,2]和[1,3]相互作用决定了产物选择性。

2. 直链和支链产物的比例由初始C-H键活化步骤中形成的直链与异构烷基中间体的相对数量决定。

3. 金属的选择（钽vs钨）影响产物分布。与钽基催化剂相比，钨基催化剂通常产生更窄的产物分布。

4. 金属杂环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性，这可能因金属和取代基而异。

5. C-H键活化、烯烃形成和氢化步骤的效率。

这些因素可能因特定的烷烃底物、反应条件和催化剂结构而异，导致不同烷烃转化过程中活性和选择性的差异。
