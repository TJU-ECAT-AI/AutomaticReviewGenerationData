          "We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12). Treatment of these two surface complexes under hydrogen at 150C overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum (111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si)(=Si-o-) Ta-H ([Ta],-H)"

          "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

          "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

          "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species"

          "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."

          "A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

          "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

          1. Catalyst formation: The active catalyst, a surface tantalum(III) monohydride ([Ta],-H), is formed by reacting tantalum complexes with surface hydroxyl groups of dehydroxylated silica, followed by hydrogen treatment.

          2. C-H Bond Activation: For acyclic alkanes, the first step involves C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis, producing a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen. For cyclic alkanes, only this step occurs, resulting in a stoichiometric reaction rather than catalytic metathesis.

          3. C-C Bond Cleavage and Formation: In acyclic alkanes, the reaction proceeds to a second step involving C-C bond cleavage and formation. This occurs through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism involving a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle.

          4. Methyl Transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of a methyl group from one alkane molecule to another, facilitated by the tantalum-alkyl intermediate.

          5. Product Formation: This process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs of the original alkane.

          The mechanism appears to be primarily a one-site scheme, as it doesn't explicitly mention involvement of two separate catalytic sites. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on:

          1. Alkane Structure: Linear and branched alkanes undergo metathesis, while cyclic alkanes only undergo C-H activation without further reaction.

          2. Steric Factors: For higher alkanes, the formation of different tantalum-alkyl species (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl for propane) can occur, influencing product distribution.

          3. Secondary Reactions: As the reaction progresses, secondary reactions can occur, leading to a wider product distribution for higher alkanes.

          The mechanism does not explicitly mention the formation of alkene or metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are typically associated with olefin metathesis. Instead, it proposes direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through σ-bond metathesis. This unique mechanism allows for the metathesis of saturated alkanes, which is not possible with traditional olefin metathesis catalysts.

          由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理涉及几个关键步骤：

          1. 催化剂形成：活性催化剂，表面钽(III)单氢化物([Ta],-H)，是通过钽配合物与脱羟基二氧化硅的表面羟基反应，然后在氢气处理下形成的。

          2. C-H键活化：对于非环烷烃，第一步涉及通过σ键复分解的C-H键活化，产生钽-烷基物种和氢气。对于环烷烃，只发生这一步，导致化学计量反应而非催化复分解。

          3. C-C键断裂和形成：在非环烷烃中，反应进行到涉及C-C键断裂和形成的第二步。这通过涉及金属环中sp3碳的四中心过渡态的σ键复分解机制发生。

          4. 甲基转移：该机制涉及在钽-烷基中间体的促进下，从一个烷烃分子到另一个烷烃分子的甲基转移。

          5. 产物形成：这个过程导致原始烷烃的高级和低级同系物的形成。

          该机制主要是单点机制，因为它没有明确提到两个独立催化位点的参与。催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能取决于：

          1. 烷烃结构：直链和支链烷烃都会发生复分解，而环烷烃只发生C-H活化而无进一步反应。

          2. 位阻因素：对于高级烷烃，可能形成不同的钽-烷基物种（例如，丙烷形成正丙基和异丙基），影响产物分布。

          3. 次级反应：随着反应的进行，可能发生次级反应，导致高级烷烃产物分布更广。

          该机制没有明确提到烯烃或金属环丁烷中间体的形成，这些通常与烯烃复分解相关。相反，它提出了通过σ键复分解直接断裂和形成C-C键。这种独特的机制允许饱和烷烃的复分解，而这在传统的烯烃复分解催化剂中是不可能的。
