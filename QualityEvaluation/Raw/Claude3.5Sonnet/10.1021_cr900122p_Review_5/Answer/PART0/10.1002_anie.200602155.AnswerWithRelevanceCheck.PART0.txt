          "Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

"It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

"Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

"Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. CH Activation: The process begins with the activation of CH bonds in alkanes, forming an alkyl species on the catalyst surface.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, yielding either an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. These serve as the necessary propagating centers for olefin metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

This mechanism represents a one-site scheme, as the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst performs all necessary functions (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) on a single metal center. This contrasts with two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds in alkanes (Cn-1).

Key intermediates in this process include olefins, hydridocarbenes, and likely metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the overall transformation. The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues demonstrates its versatility in alkane conversions.

While the information provided doesn't specifically address cyclic alkane transformations, the general mechanism should apply to both linear and cyclic systems, with potential differences in reactivity and selectivity based on structural constraints.

The catalyst's performance and efficiency in various alkane conversions are influenced by its ability to balance the rates of each step in the catalytic cycle, maintain active sites, and resist deactivation under reaction conditions.

          由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. CH活化：过程始于烷烃中CH键的活化，在催化剂表面形成烷基物种。

2. 脱氢：烷基物种经历β-H或α-H转移，生成烯烃或氢化物卡宾中间体。这些作为烯烃复分解所需的传播中心。

3. 烯烃复分解：关键的碳-碳键断裂和键形成步骤通过[2+2]环反转和环加成机制进行，类似于传统的烯烃复分解。这可能涉及金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

4. 加氢：最后一步涉及复分解产物的加氢，得到新的烷烃。

这种机理代表了一个单点方案，因为二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂在单一金属中心上执行所有必要的功能（CH活化、脱氢、复分解和加氢）。这与像Chevron过程这样的双点方案形成对比，后者使用单独的催化剂进行脱氢/加氢和复分解。

反应对Cn-1和Cn+1同系物表现出选择性，这归因于主要路径涉及终端烯烃（Cn-2）与由烷烃终端CH键活化形成的烯叉基物种（Cn-1）之间的交叉复分解。

这个过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃、氢化物卡宾和可能的金属环丁烷，它们在整个转化过程中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂将甲烷并入更高同系物的能力展示了其在烷烃转化中的多功能性。

虽然提供的信息没有具体提到环烷烃的转化，但一般机理应该适用于直链和环状系统，基于结构限制可能在反应性和选择性上存在潜在差异。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的性能和效率受其平衡催化循环中每个步骤速率、维持活性位点以及在反应条件下抗失活能力的影响。
