The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps:

1. Initiation: The highly electrophilic tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] supported on silica acts as the catalyst precursor, capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. C-C Bond Activation: The catalyst selectively cleaves and forms carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes.

3. Formation of Key Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis.

4. Metallacyclobutane Formation: The favored pathway for forming higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one.

5. Product Formation: The metallacyclobutanes undergo cycloreversion to form new alkanes and regenerate the active catalyst species.

6. Selectivity: The mechanism favors the formation of linear alkanes over branched ones, as branched compounds would require less-reactive disubstituted carbenes.

7. Product Distribution: In propane metathesis, for example, the reaction selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.

The mechanism appears to primarily follow a one-site scheme, where all steps occur on a single tantalum center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism involving cooperation between adjacent tantalum centers cannot be completely ruled out based on the provided information.

For both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the key steps involve the formation of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The main difference would likely be in the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed from cyclic alkanes.

The catalyst performance and selectivity are influenced by factors such as:
- The electrophilicity of the tantalum center
- The stability and reactivity of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates
- The preference for 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones
- The relative rates of formation and decomposition of various intermediates

These factors contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalyst in transforming alkanes into their higher and lower homologues while maintaining selectivity towards linear products.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(·SiO)2TaH] involves several key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in the reactants (e.g., ethane and toluene), resulting in the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reactants and different types of C-H bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The C-H activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalum-ethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], tantalum-benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5], and tantalum-methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] species.

3. Reaction with alkanes: These intermediate complexes then react with alkane molecules (e.g., ethane) to produce new alkanes (e.g., propane) and aromatic products (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes), while forming a tantalum-methyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The catalytic cycle is completed by the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an alkane or aromatic molecule, regenerating the key intermediate complexes.

The mechanism appears to follow a one-site scheme, as there is no explicit mention of a two-site process. The reaction involves both cleavage and formation of C-C bonds in acyclic alkanes, transforming them into mixtures of higher and lower homologues.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by:
1. Competition between reagents for active sites
2. Relative rates of reaction for different intermediates
3. Partial pressures of reactants, which affect the concentrations of surface species

While the document doesn't provide detailed information on the specific processes for cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, it suggests that the mechanism can be extended to other alkane conversions.

The catalyst shows some deactivation over time, which can be mitigated by the presence of hydrogen. This implies that the formation of unsaturated surface species may play a role in catalyst deactivation.

Overall, this system represents a novel approach to C-C bond formation from alkanes, demonstrating the potential for cross-metathesis between sp3 and sp2 carbon centers, albeit with modest catalytic performance.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: 
   a) Carbene hydride species form through α-H abstraction
   b) Olefin hydride species form through β-H abstraction
   These are crucial intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The carbene and olefin intermediates interact to form a tantallacyclobutane. This step is analogous to the mechanism in olefin metathesis.

4. Metallacycle decomposition: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin.

5. Product formation: Hydrogenation of the new olefins produces new alkanes.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur on a single tantalum center. In a two-site scheme, different tantalum centers may be involved in the various steps, such as C-H activation, olefin formation, and metathesis.

For linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the basic steps remain the same, but the specific intermediates and product distributions may differ. Cyclic alkanes may form more complex metallacycles.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins then participate in further reactions, leading to the redistribution of carbon chains characteristic of alkane metathesis.

Key factors influencing reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include:

1. The [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates govern product selectivity.

2. The ratio of linear to branched products is determined by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H bond activation step.

3. The choice of metal (tantalum vs. tungsten) affects product distribution. Tungsten-based catalysts generally produce a narrower distribution of products compared to tantalum-based catalysts.

4. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, which can vary depending on the metal and substituents.

5. The efficiency of C-H bond activation, olefin formation, and hydrogenation steps.

These factors can vary depending on the specific alkane substrate, reaction conditions, and catalyst structure, leading to differences in activity and selectivity across different alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through C-H bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species. The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

Two possible mechanisms are proposed:
1. Two-site mechanism: This involves cooperation between two tantalum sites, with one site forming the carbene and the other activating the alkane.
2. One-site mechanism: A single tantalum site performs both the carbene formation and alkane activation steps.

The process for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations includes:
1. Initial activation of alkanes
2. Carbene formation
3. Olefin formation (likely through β-hydride elimination)
4. Olefin metathesis
5. Chain propagation

Key intermediates in this process include:
- Surface alkyl species
- Carbenes
- Olefins
- Metallacyclobutanes (likely involved in the olefin metathesis step)

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on factors such as:
- Relative stability of different carbene intermediates
- Rates of olefin formation and consumption
- Ability of the catalyst to coordinate and activate different alkanes
- Reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure)
- Catalyst design (e.g., the electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride)

The catalyst shows high selectivity for cross-metathesis, as demonstrated in the propane conversion experiment where 95% of propane is converted through cross-metathesis with methane to produce ethane. This ability to incorporate methane into higher alkanes demonstrates the catalyst's potential for various alkane conversions and valorization of methane.

However, the exact details of how these factors contribute to selectivity and performance are still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand the intricacies of the catalyst's behavior in different alkane conversion scenarios.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane activation: The Ta-H species activates C-H bonds in alkanes to form Ta-alkyl intermediates.

2. Formation of intermediates: This activation leads to the formation of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates.

3. π-bond metathesis: The key C-C bond formation/cleavage step occurs through π-bond metathesis between the metallacarbene and the alkene intermediates. This likely proceeds through metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Product formation: The metallacyclobutane intermediates break down to form new alkanes and regenerate the tantalum carbene species.

The mechanism can operate through both one-site and two-site pathways:

- One-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single tantalum center.
- Two-site mechanism: Alkane activation and alkene formation occur on one site, while carbene formation and metathesis occur on another.

For linear alkanes, this process results in the formation of lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane. 

Cyclic alkanes can undergo similar transformations, potentially leading to ring opening or redistribution of carbon atoms in the ring.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as:
- The nature of the silica support, which provides site isolation
- The reactivity of the tantalum hydride species
- The stability of the various intermediates
- The relative rates of alkane activation, alkene formation, and metathesis steps

Related processes include:
- Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes, likely involving similar intermediates
- Non-oxidative coupling of methane, which involves C-H activation on tantalum carbene or carbyne intermediates, though this process is less efficient due to its endothermic nature.

The unique ability of supported Ta-H species to perform both C-H activation and olefin metathesis allows for the direct transformation of unactivated alkanes under relatively mild conditions (e.g., 150°C).

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which play a crucial role in the selective production of linear homologues.

Key aspects of this mechanism include:

1. Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are crucial for the stepwise transfer of carbon atoms.

2. Carbon transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, leading to the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane. This stepwise transfer effectively prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes.

3. Carbene-olefin mechanism: The product selectivities in alkane metathesis follow the Chauvin and Hérisson carbene-olefin mechanism. This mechanism explains:
   a) High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.
   b) Low selectivity towards branched alkanes because of the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

4. Product distribution: For tantalum hydride catalysts supported on oxide supports, linear higher homologues are the major products, with butanes and pentanes being the primary higher homologues formed, along with trace amounts of hexanes. However, when supported on silica, there is a contrast in selectivity, with branched higher homologues up to C10 being favored, particularly the isohomologues (except for pentanes).

5. Selectivity: The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, although the literature focuses primarily on linear alkane conversions. The selective nature of this catalytic system contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions by favoring the formation of specific homologues and limiting the production of certain types of alkanes.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on two-site versus one-site schemes, the described mechanism suggests a single-site process involving the tantalum hydride catalyst. The formation of key intermediates, along with the stepwise carbon transfer process, contributes significantly to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism:
1. CH bond activation forms Ta-alkyl species and H2
2. One site generates alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating Ta-H 
3. Other site forms Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer

One-site mechanism:
Ta-alkyl alkylidene intermediates form in situ within the metal's coordination sphere

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. Key steps include:
1. CH bond activation
2. Formation of alkyl, alkylidene, and alkene intermediates  
3. Alkene metathesis reactions via [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion

For linear alkanes, the process is selective for n±1 homologues, indicating 1-alkenes are the primary participants. This selectivity stems from the alkene metathesis step.

Cyclic alkanes (except cyclopentane) undergo transformation at lower rates, yielding lower cyclic homologues. For example, cyclohexane converts to methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, while cycloheptane forms methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane.

The catalyst performance depends on the formation and reactivity of key intermediates like Ta-H, Ta-alkyl, Ta-alkylidene, alkenes, and metallacyclobutanes. The balance between dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation processes influences the overall reaction. Optimizing these intermediates through catalyst design can improve activity and selectivity for various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a single-site approach. The key steps in this process are:

1. Paraffin dehydrogenation: C-H bond activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl complex, which then produces an olefin and a metal-hydride.

2. Olefin metathesis: This occurs on a metallocarbene formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl.

3. Hydrogenation: The newly formed olefins are hydrogenated on the metal-hydride.

This mechanism allows for the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, involving both cleavage and formation of C-H and C-C bonds. The process can transform light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures.

For linear alkanes, such as propane, the reaction typically produces ethane (45-50%), butanes (30-35%), methane, and higher C5+ alkanes. The primary products of the reaction are olefins and H2.

The catalyst [(RSiO)2TaH] is described as a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. A newer catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, has been developed which gives higher turnover numbers and greater stability than the tantalum hydrides. Both the tantalum and tungsten hydride systems are characterized as multifunctional single-site catalysts, capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation.

The formation of key intermediates like olefins and metallocarbenes plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These intermediates facilitate the carbon transfer process and contribute to the overall selectivity of the reaction.

The provided information does not specifically discuss cyclic alkane transformations, two-site schemes, or the formation of metallacyclobutanes. It also doesn't provide detailed information on how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity in various alkane conversions beyond what has been mentioned for propane.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. Low coordination and electron-deficient metal centers are crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction process: Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues through a redistribution process.

3. Key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism likely involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species, which are typical in olefin metathesis reactions.

4. Support interactions: The silica support plays an important role, as reactions between metal hydride intermediates and adjacent siloxane bridges can occur, forming new Si-H bonds.

5. Selectivity: The catalyst shows selectivity towards C(n-1) and C(n+1) homologues. For example, an improved catalyst (6) shows 80% selectivity for ethane and butanes, with only 10% methane production.

6. Catalyst performance: The performance is influenced by factors such as deactivation rate and turnover number (TON). The improved catalyst (6) shows higher overall activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1), achieving 100 turnovers after 120 hours, compared to 58 for the original catalyst.

7. Side reactions: The improved catalyst (6) is less active for hydrogenolysis compared to the original catalyst (1), with a 5 times lower initial rate for propane hydrogenolysis.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although specific details are not provided. The improved performance of catalyst 6 can be attributed to its modified coordination environment, which likely stabilizes the active species and promotes the desired metathesis pathway over competing reactions like hydrogenolysis.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

          1. Catalyst formation: The active catalyst, a surface tantalum(III) monohydride ([Ta],-H), is formed by reacting tantalum complexes with surface hydroxyl groups of dehydroxylated silica, followed by hydrogen treatment.

          2. C-H Bond Activation: For acyclic alkanes, the first step involves C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis, producing a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen. For cyclic alkanes, only this step occurs, resulting in a stoichiometric reaction rather than catalytic metathesis.

          3. C-C Bond Cleavage and Formation: In acyclic alkanes, the reaction proceeds to a second step involving C-C bond cleavage and formation. This occurs through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism involving a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle.

          4. Methyl Transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of a methyl group from one alkane molecule to another, facilitated by the tantalum-alkyl intermediate.

          5. Product Formation: This process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs of the original alkane.

          The mechanism appears to be primarily a one-site scheme, as it doesn't explicitly mention involvement of two separate catalytic sites. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on:

          1. Alkane Structure: Linear and branched alkanes undergo metathesis, while cyclic alkanes only undergo C-H activation without further reaction.

          2. Steric Factors: For higher alkanes, the formation of different tantalum-alkyl species (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl for propane) can occur, influencing product distribution.

          3. Secondary Reactions: As the reaction progresses, secondary reactions can occur, leading to a wider product distribution for higher alkanes.

          The mechanism does not explicitly mention the formation of alkene or metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are typically associated with olefin metathesis. Instead, it proposes direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through σ-bond metathesis. This unique mechanism allows for the metathesis of saturated alkanes, which is not possible with traditional olefin metathesis catalysts.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the primary carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation process, involving the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of critical intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides and metallacyclobutane intermediates are crucial in the reaction.

3. Two possible mechanisms:
   a) Single-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single catalytic site.
   b) Two-site mechanism: One site generates the olefin, while another performs the metathesis.

4. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

5. Linear vs. branched alkanes: The catalyst efficiently converts linear alkanes (e.g., butane) into lower and higher homologues, but struggles with branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylpropane).

6. Chain length effects: The catalyst shows different performance for alkanes of different chain lengths. For instance, it effectively converts butane but not ethane.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:
- Steric factors in metallacyclobutane formation
- The ability to form and break carbon-carbon bonds through π-bond metathesis
- The structure of the alkane (linear vs. branched)
- The chain length of the alkane

These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis process, with the catalyst showing high activity for linear alkanes but limited effectiveness for very short chain or branched alkanes.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. CH Activation: The process begins with the activation of CH bonds in alkanes, forming an alkyl species on the catalyst surface.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, yielding either an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. These serve as the necessary propagating centers for olefin metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

This mechanism represents a one-site scheme, as the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst performs all necessary functions (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) on a single metal center. This contrasts with two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds in alkanes (Cn-1).

Key intermediates in this process include olefins, hydridocarbenes, and likely metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the overall transformation. The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues demonstrates its versatility in alkane conversions.

While the information provided doesn't specifically address cyclic alkane transformations, the general mechanism should apply to both linear and cyclic systems, with potential differences in reactivity and selectivity based on structural constraints.

The catalyst's performance and efficiency in various alkane conversions are influenced by its ability to balance the rates of each step in the catalytic cycle, maintain active sites, and resist deactivation under reaction conditions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism:
1. CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl species
2. One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides
3. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer
4. Alkene undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes
5. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps release lower and higher alkane homologues

One-site mechanism:
1. Tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates form from tantalum hydrides
2. Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere
3. Cross-metathesis products result from alkane reaction with neopentyl neopentylidene surface complexes

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. The key processes involve CH bond activation, alkene formation, and CC bond cleavage/formation through metallacyclobutane intermediates.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n±1 homologues due to 1-alkene participation in metathesis. Cyclic alkanes undergo similar processes but with lower rates, forming lower cyclic homologues through γ-H activation and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of these catalysts depend on:
1. Support material (silica, alumina, etc.)
2. Metal used (Ta, W, Mo, etc.)
3. Ligand environment (hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes)
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)

These factors influence the stability of key intermediates, rates of elementary steps, and overall catalytic activity. The ability to form and maintain active alkylidene species is crucial for sustained catalytic performance in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] (1) shows high reactivity towards alkanes through various pathways:

1. For linear alkanes:
- CH bond activation occurs at low temperatures (25-80°C), forming surface alkyl complexes.
- Successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time is preferred over two-carbon cleavage processes.
- The catalyst can perform H/D exchange, transform acyclic alkanes into lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis), and catalyze hydrogenolysis into methane.

2. For cyclic alkanes:
- Multiple pathways are proposed, including σ-bond metathesis, direct oxidative addition, and CH bond activation followed by intramolecular rearrangements.
- Hydrogenolysis occurs under mild conditions, but with lower activity compared to acyclic alkanes.
- Ring contraction is a key feature, likely occurring via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways.

3. Key intermediates and their roles:
- Surface alkyl complexes form through CH bond activation.
- Metallacyclobutanes and carbenes are crucial for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation of smaller ring systems.
- Alkylidene hydrides, olefin hydrides, and metallacyclobutanes are generated through α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction.

4. Factors affecting selectivity and catalyst performance:
- Ring size influences the reactivity of cycloalkanes, with larger rings being more reactive.
- Formation of cyclopentadienyl species from cyclopentane leads to catalyst deactivation.
- Temperature affects the formation of inactive species and overall catalyst performance.

The mechanism involves both one-site and two-site processes, with evidence suggesting that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition for certain steps. The formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions is proposed as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in cycloalkane transformations.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps:

1. Initiation: The highly electrophilic tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] supported on silica acts as the catalyst precursor, capable of activating alkane C-H bonds.

2. C-C Bond Activation: The catalyst selectively cleaves and forms carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes.

3. Formation of Key Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to olefin metathesis.

4. Metallacyclobutane Formation: The favored pathway for forming higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane intermediate rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one.

5. Product Formation: The metallacyclobutanes undergo cycloreversion to form new alkanes and regenerate the active catalyst species.

6. Selectivity: The mechanism favors the formation of linear alkanes over branched ones, as branched compounds would require less-reactive disubstituted carbenes.

7. Product Distribution: In propane metathesis, for example, the reaction selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes.

The mechanism appears to primarily follow a one-site scheme, where all steps occur on a single tantalum center. However, the possibility of a two-site mechanism involving cooperation between adjacent tantalum centers cannot be completely ruled out based on the provided information.

For both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the key steps involve the formation of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. The main difference would likely be in the nature of the metallacyclobutane intermediates formed from cyclic alkanes.

The catalyst performance and selectivity are influenced by factors such as:
- The electrophilicity of the tantalum center
- The stability and reactivity of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates
- The preference for 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones
- The relative rates of formation and decomposition of various intermediates

These factors contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalyst in transforming alkanes into their higher and lower homologues while maintaining selectivity towards linear products.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides [(·SiO)2TaH] involves several key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in the reactants (e.g., ethane and toluene), resulting in the liberation of molecular hydrogen. This step involves competition between different reactants and different types of C-H bonds within molecules.

2. Formation of intermediates: The C-H activation leads to the formation of various tantalum complexes, including tantalum-ethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], tantalum-benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5], and tantalum-methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] species.

3. Reaction with alkanes: These intermediate complexes then react with alkane molecules (e.g., ethane) to produce new alkanes (e.g., propane) and aromatic products (e.g., ethylbenzene, xylenes), while forming a tantalum-methyl intermediate.

4. Regeneration of active species: The catalytic cycle is completed by the displacement of the methyl group from tantalum by either an alkane or aromatic molecule, regenerating the key intermediate complexes.

The mechanism appears to follow a one-site scheme, as there is no explicit mention of a two-site process. The reaction involves both cleavage and formation of C-C bonds in acyclic alkanes, transforming them into mixtures of higher and lower homologues.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by:
1. Competition between reagents for active sites
2. Relative rates of reaction for different intermediates
3. Partial pressures of reactants, which affect the concentrations of surface species

While the document doesn't provide detailed information on the specific processes for cyclic alkane transformations or the formation of alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, it suggests that the mechanism can be extended to other alkane conversions.

The catalyst shows some deactivation over time, which can be mitigated by the presence of hydrogen. This implies that the formation of unsaturated surface species may play a role in catalyst deactivation.

Overall, this system represents a novel approach to C-C bond formation from alkanes, demonstrating the potential for cross-metathesis between sp3 and sp2 carbon centers, albeit with modest catalytic performance.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps and processes:

1. Initiation: The reaction begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride, forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex.

2. Formation of key intermediates: 
   a) Carbene hydride species form through α-H abstraction
   b) Olefin hydride species form through β-H abstraction
   These are crucial intermediates in the catalytic cycle.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The carbene and olefin intermediates interact to form a tantallacyclobutane. This step is analogous to the mechanism in olefin metathesis.

4. Metallacycle decomposition: The tantallacyclobutane decomposes to yield a new carbene and a new olefin.

5. Product formation: Hydrogenation of the new olefins produces new alkanes.

This mechanism supports both one-site and two-site schemes. In a one-site scheme, all steps occur on a single tantalum center. In a two-site scheme, different tantalum centers may be involved in the various steps, such as C-H activation, olefin formation, and metathesis.

For linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the basic steps remain the same, but the specific intermediates and product distributions may differ. Cyclic alkanes may form more complex metallacycles.

The formation of olefins as primary products, along with hydrogen, is crucial for the overall metathesis process. These olefins then participate in further reactions, leading to the redistribution of carbon chains characteristic of alkane metathesis.

Key factors influencing reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include:

1. The [1,2] and [1,3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutane intermediates govern product selectivity.

2. The ratio of linear to branched products is determined by the relative amounts of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates formed during the initial C-H bond activation step.

3. The choice of metal (tantalum vs. tungsten) affects product distribution. Tungsten-based catalysts generally produce a narrower distribution of products compared to tantalum-based catalysts.

4. The stability and reactivity of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, which can vary depending on the metal and substituents.

5. The efficiency of C-H bond activation, olefin formation, and hydrogenation steps.

These factors can vary depending on the specific alkane substrate, reaction conditions, and catalyst structure, leading to differences in activity and selectivity across different alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes. The catalyst [(SiO)2Ta-H] activates alkanes through C-H bond cleavage, forming surface alkyl species. The current proposed mechanism involves carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis, rather than the previously suggested σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition.

Two possible mechanisms are proposed:
1. Two-site mechanism: This involves cooperation between two tantalum sites, with one site forming the carbene and the other activating the alkane.
2. One-site mechanism: A single tantalum site performs both the carbene formation and alkane activation steps.

The process for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations includes:
1. Initial activation of alkanes
2. Carbene formation
3. Olefin formation (likely through β-hydride elimination)
4. Olefin metathesis
5. Chain propagation

Key intermediates in this process include:
- Surface alkyl species
- Carbenes
- Olefins
- Metallacyclobutanes (likely involved in the olefin metathesis step)

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on factors such as:
- Relative stability of different carbene intermediates
- Rates of olefin formation and consumption
- Ability of the catalyst to coordinate and activate different alkanes
- Reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure)
- Catalyst design (e.g., the electrophilic nature of the tantalum hydride)

The catalyst shows high selectivity for cross-metathesis, as demonstrated in the propane conversion experiment where 95% of propane is converted through cross-metathesis with methane to produce ethane. This ability to incorporate methane into higher alkanes demonstrates the catalyst's potential for various alkane conversions and valorization of methane.

However, the exact details of how these factors contribute to selectivity and performance are still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand the intricacies of the catalyst's behavior in different alkane conversion scenarios.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane activation: The Ta-H species activates C-H bonds in alkanes to form Ta-alkyl intermediates.

2. Formation of intermediates: This activation leads to the formation of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates.

3. π-bond metathesis: The key C-C bond formation/cleavage step occurs through π-bond metathesis between the metallacarbene and the alkene intermediates. This likely proceeds through metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Product formation: The metallacyclobutane intermediates break down to form new alkanes and regenerate the tantalum carbene species.

The mechanism can operate through both one-site and two-site pathways:

- One-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single tantalum center.
- Two-site mechanism: Alkane activation and alkene formation occur on one site, while carbene formation and metathesis occur on another.

For linear alkanes, this process results in the formation of lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane. 

Cyclic alkanes can undergo similar transformations, potentially leading to ring opening or redistribution of carbon atoms in the ring.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by factors such as:
- The nature of the silica support, which provides site isolation
- The reactivity of the tantalum hydride species
- The stability of the various intermediates
- The relative rates of alkane activation, alkene formation, and metathesis steps

Related processes include:
- Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes, likely involving similar intermediates
- Non-oxidative coupling of methane, which involves C-H activation on tantalum carbene or carbyne intermediates, though this process is less efficient due to its endothermic nature.

The unique ability of supported Ta-H species to perform both C-H activation and olefin metathesis allows for the direct transformation of unactivated alkanes under relatively mild conditions (e.g., 150°C).

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which play a crucial role in the selective production of linear homologues.

Key aspects of this mechanism include:

1. Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are crucial for the stepwise transfer of carbon atoms.

2. Carbon transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, leading to the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane. This stepwise transfer effectively prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes.

3. Carbene-olefin mechanism: The product selectivities in alkane metathesis follow the Chauvin and Hérisson carbene-olefin mechanism. This mechanism explains:
   a) High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.
   b) Low selectivity towards branched alkanes because of the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

4. Product distribution: For tantalum hydride catalysts supported on oxide supports, linear higher homologues are the major products, with butanes and pentanes being the primary higher homologues formed, along with trace amounts of hexanes. However, when supported on silica, there is a contrast in selectivity, with branched higher homologues up to C10 being favored, particularly the isohomologues (except for pentanes).

5. Selectivity: The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, although the literature focuses primarily on linear alkane conversions. The selective nature of this catalytic system contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions by favoring the formation of specific homologues and limiting the production of certain types of alkanes.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on two-site versus one-site schemes, the described mechanism suggests a single-site process involving the tantalum hydride catalyst. The formation of key intermediates, along with the stepwise carbon transfer process, contributes significantly to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism:
1. CH bond activation forms Ta-alkyl species and H2
2. One site generates alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating Ta-H 
3. Other site forms Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer

One-site mechanism:
Ta-alkyl alkylidene intermediates form in situ within the metal's coordination sphere

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. Key steps include:
1. CH bond activation
2. Formation of alkyl, alkylidene, and alkene intermediates  
3. Alkene metathesis reactions via [2+2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion

For linear alkanes, the process is selective for n±1 homologues, indicating 1-alkenes are the primary participants. This selectivity stems from the alkene metathesis step.

Cyclic alkanes (except cyclopentane) undergo transformation at lower rates, yielding lower cyclic homologues. For example, cyclohexane converts to methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, while cycloheptane forms methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane.

The catalyst performance depends on the formation and reactivity of key intermediates like Ta-H, Ta-alkyl, Ta-alkylidene, alkenes, and metallacyclobutanes. The balance between dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation processes influences the overall reaction. Optimizing these intermediates through catalyst design can improve activity and selectivity for various alkane conversions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a single-site approach. The key steps in this process are:

1. Paraffin dehydrogenation: C-H bond activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl complex, which then produces an olefin and a metal-hydride.

2. Olefin metathesis: This occurs on a metallocarbene formed via α-H elimination from the metal-alkyl.

3. Hydrogenation: The newly formed olefins are hydrogenated on the metal-hydride.

This mechanism allows for the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, involving both cleavage and formation of C-H and C-C bonds. The process can transform light alkanes into their lower and higher homologues at moderate temperatures.

For linear alkanes, such as propane, the reaction typically produces ethane (45-50%), butanes (30-35%), methane, and higher C5+ alkanes. The primary products of the reaction are olefins and H2.

The catalyst [(RSiO)2TaH] is described as a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica. A newer catalyst, W(H)3/Al2O3500, has been developed which gives higher turnover numbers and greater stability than the tantalum hydrides. Both the tantalum and tungsten hydride systems are characterized as multifunctional single-site catalysts, capable of alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis, and olefin hydrogenation.

The formation of key intermediates like olefins and metallocarbenes plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These intermediates facilitate the carbon transfer process and contribute to the overall selectivity of the reaction.

The provided information does not specifically discuss cyclic alkane transformations, two-site schemes, or the formation of metallacyclobutanes. It also doesn't provide detailed information on how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity in various alkane conversions beyond what has been mentioned for propane.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key aspects:

1. Catalyst structure: The active catalyst is a silica-supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH]. Low coordination and electron-deficient metal centers are crucial for catalytic performance.

2. Reaction process: Alkane metathesis converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues through a redistribution process.

3. Key intermediates: While not explicitly mentioned, the mechanism likely involves the formation of alkene intermediates and metallacyclobutane species, which are typical in olefin metathesis reactions.

4. Support interactions: The silica support plays an important role, as reactions between metal hydride intermediates and adjacent siloxane bridges can occur, forming new Si-H bonds.

5. Selectivity: The catalyst shows selectivity towards C(n-1) and C(n+1) homologues. For example, an improved catalyst (6) shows 80% selectivity for ethane and butanes, with only 10% methane production.

6. Catalyst performance: The performance is influenced by factors such as deactivation rate and turnover number (TON). The improved catalyst (6) shows higher overall activity and longer lifetime compared to the original catalyst (1), achieving 100 turnovers after 120 hours, compared to 58 for the original catalyst.

7. Side reactions: The improved catalyst (6) is less active for hydrogenolysis compared to the original catalyst (1), with a 5 times lower initial rate for propane hydrogenolysis.

The mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways, although specific details are not provided. The improved performance of catalyst 6 can be attributed to its modified coordination environment, which likely stabilizes the active species and promotes the desired metathesis pathway over competing reactions like hydrogenolysis.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

          1. Catalyst formation: The active catalyst, a surface tantalum(III) monohydride ([Ta],-H), is formed by reacting tantalum complexes with surface hydroxyl groups of dehydroxylated silica, followed by hydrogen treatment.

          2. C-H Bond Activation: For acyclic alkanes, the first step involves C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis, producing a tantalum-alkyl species and hydrogen. For cyclic alkanes, only this step occurs, resulting in a stoichiometric reaction rather than catalytic metathesis.

          3. C-C Bond Cleavage and Formation: In acyclic alkanes, the reaction proceeds to a second step involving C-C bond cleavage and formation. This occurs through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism involving a four-centered transition state with an sp3 carbon in the metallocycle.

          4. Methyl Transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of a methyl group from one alkane molecule to another, facilitated by the tantalum-alkyl intermediate.

          5. Product Formation: This process leads to the formation of higher and lower homologs of the original alkane.

          The mechanism appears to be primarily a one-site scheme, as it doesn't explicitly mention involvement of two separate catalytic sites. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on:

          1. Alkane Structure: Linear and branched alkanes undergo metathesis, while cyclic alkanes only undergo C-H activation without further reaction.

          2. Steric Factors: For higher alkanes, the formation of different tantalum-alkyl species (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl for propane) can occur, influencing product distribution.

          3. Secondary Reactions: As the reaction progresses, secondary reactions can occur, leading to a wider product distribution for higher alkanes.

          The mechanism does not explicitly mention the formation of alkene or metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are typically associated with olefin metathesis. Instead, it proposes direct C-C bond cleavage and formation through σ-bond metathesis. This unique mechanism allows for the metathesis of saturated alkanes, which is not possible with traditional olefin metathesis catalysts.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the primary carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation process, involving the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of critical intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides and metallacyclobutane intermediates are crucial in the reaction.

3. Two possible mechanisms:
   a) Single-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single catalytic site.
   b) Two-site mechanism: One site generates the olefin, while another performs the metathesis.

4. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

5. Linear vs. branched alkanes: The catalyst efficiently converts linear alkanes (e.g., butane) into lower and higher homologues, but struggles with branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylpropane).

6. Chain length effects: The catalyst shows different performance for alkanes of different chain lengths. For instance, it effectively converts butane but not ethane.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:
- Steric factors in metallacyclobutane formation
- The ability to form and break carbon-carbon bonds through π-bond metathesis
- The structure of the alkane (linear vs. branched)
- The chain length of the alkane

These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis process, with the catalyst showing high activity for linear alkanes but limited effectiveness for very short chain or branched alkanes.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key steps:

1. CH Activation: The process begins with the activation of CH bonds in alkanes, forming an alkyl species on the catalyst surface.

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl species undergoes β-H or α-H transfer, yielding either an olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate. These serve as the necessary propagating centers for olefin metathesis.

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism, similar to traditional olefin metathesis. This likely involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates.

4. Hydrogenation: The final step involves the hydrogenation of the metathesis products to form new alkanes.

This mechanism represents a one-site scheme, as the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst performs all necessary functions (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) on a single metal center. This contrasts with two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.

The reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds in alkanes (Cn-1).

Key intermediates in this process include olefins, hydridocarbenes, and likely metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the overall transformation. The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues demonstrates its versatility in alkane conversions.

While the information provided doesn't specifically address cyclic alkane transformations, the general mechanism should apply to both linear and cyclic systems, with potential differences in reactivity and selectivity based on structural constraints.

The catalyst's performance and efficiency in various alkane conversions are influenced by its ability to balance the rates of each step in the catalytic cycle, maintain active sites, and resist deactivation under reaction conditions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both two-site and one-site schemes:

Two-site mechanism:
1. CH bond activation forms H2 and Ta-alkyl species
2. One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides
3. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer
4. Alkene undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes
5. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis steps release lower and higher alkane homologues

One-site mechanism:
1. Tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates form from tantalum hydrides
2. Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere
3. Cross-metathesis products result from alkane reaction with neopentyl neopentylidene surface complexes

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride intermediates. The key processes involve CH bond activation, alkene formation, and CC bond cleavage/formation through metallacyclobutane intermediates.

For linear alkanes, the reaction produces mainly n±1 homologues due to 1-alkene participation in metathesis. Cyclic alkanes undergo similar processes but with lower rates, forming lower cyclic homologues through γ-H activation and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of these catalysts depend on:
1. Support material (silica, alumina, etc.)
2. Metal used (Ta, W, Mo, etc.)
3. Ligand environment (hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes)
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)

These factors influence the stability of key intermediates, rates of elementary steps, and overall catalytic activity. The ability to form and maintain active alkylidene species is crucial for sustained catalytic performance in various alkane conversions.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] (1) shows high reactivity towards alkanes through various pathways:

1. For linear alkanes:
- CH bond activation occurs at low temperatures (25-80°C), forming surface alkyl complexes.
- Successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time is preferred over two-carbon cleavage processes.
- The catalyst can perform H/D exchange, transform acyclic alkanes into lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis), and catalyze hydrogenolysis into methane.

2. For cyclic alkanes:
- Multiple pathways are proposed, including σ-bond metathesis, direct oxidative addition, and CH bond activation followed by intramolecular rearrangements.
- Hydrogenolysis occurs under mild conditions, but with lower activity compared to acyclic alkanes.
- Ring contraction is a key feature, likely occurring via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways.

3. Key intermediates and their roles:
- Surface alkyl complexes form through CH bond activation.
- Metallacyclobutanes and carbenes are crucial for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation of smaller ring systems.
- Alkylidene hydrides, olefin hydrides, and metallacyclobutanes are generated through α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction.

4. Factors affecting selectivity and catalyst performance:
- Ring size influences the reactivity of cycloalkanes, with larger rings being more reactive.
- Formation of cyclopentadienyl species from cyclopentane leads to catalyst deactivation.
- Temperature affects the formation of inactive species and overall catalyst performance.

The mechanism involves both one-site and two-site processes, with evidence suggesting that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition for certain steps. The formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions is proposed as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in cycloalkane transformations.
