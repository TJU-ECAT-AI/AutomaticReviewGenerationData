[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon–carbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."

[3] "With [(SiO)Ta(CH–tBu)(CH2tBu)2] as a catalyst precursor, the ratio of cross-metathesis products and the selectivity in higher alkanes led us to propose that the key step in alkane metathesis involves metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutane intermediates as is the case with olefin metathesis."

[4] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[5] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

[1] "We have previously reported that the silica-supported tantalum hydride1 [(·SiO)2TaH] 1 catalyzes a new reaction of alkane metathesis which transforms any acyclic alkane into a mixture of higher and lower homologues (eqn. (1))."

[2] "This reaction proceeds via both cleavage and formation of the (sp3)C(sp3)C bonds of any acyclic paraffin."

[3] "Regarding the possible mechanism, both reactions begin by a CH bond activation with liberation of molecular hydrogen. This activation step involves a competition between the two reagents, e.g. ethane and toluene, as well as between the two types of CH bonds in the toluene molecule, e.g. in the methyl group or on the aromatic ring (Scheme 1)."

[4] "This leads to a mixture of tantalumethyl [(·SiO)2Ta-C2H5], benzyl [(·SiO)2Ta-CH2C6H5] or methylphenyl [(·SiO)2TaC6H4CH3] complexes which have been effectively identified by 13C CP MAS NMR."

[5] "In a second step, these complexes would then undergo mainly the reaction with a molecule of ethane to liberate propane, ethylbenzene or xylenes respectively and form a tantalummethyl intermediate; during this step, the kinetic of the reaction with ethane of the three intermediates will govern the final selectivity of the different products."

"Recent studies of propane metathesis in a continuous flow reactor showed by varying the contact time, that olefins and hydrogen were primary products of this reaction. On the basis of the product selectivities and the properties of tantalum complexes to undergo a-H [8,9] or b-H [9,10] transfer processes, it was then inferred [11,12] that alkane metathesis should involve the same carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates as olefin metathesis [13]."

"Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

"Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

"The ratio of linear to branched products is due to the relative amount of linear versus iso-alkyl intermediates, arising from the initial CH bond activation step [11,12]."

"Concerning the selectivities of the reaction obtained with the various hydrides (figure 5), it turns out that tungsten-based catalysts give a narrower distribution of products than the tantalum ones; in particular, a smaller amount of methane and pentanes is formed. Both these products come from the 1,2-disubstituted metallacyclobutane, which should be less favoured with tungsten than tantalum (scheme 2)."

[1] "Recently, we have shown that a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2Ta-H] (1), prepared by surface organometallic chemistry,12 can catalytically transform a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues.13,14 This reaction, called alkane metathesis, involves a successive cleavage and formation of carboncarbon bonds: hence two ethane molecules give one methane and one propane molecule."

[2] "While we earlier proposed mechanism based on cleaving the CC bond system by either σ-bond metathesis or oxidative addition,13 we now propose that it proceeds via carbene intermediates and olefin metathesis as suggested by previous studies.18,19"

[3] "Since the alkane-metathesis active site can be generated from either TaIII or TaV intermediates, and since olefin metathesis would require the formation of olefins, one and two-site mechanisms can be proposed (Scheme 1), which are under investigation."

Possible mechanisms via carbene intermediates: a) on two sites and b) on one site."

[5] "To observe a productive cross-metathesis of methane with an alkane, the reaction with propane was investigated in a continuous-flow reactor, and the reaction conditions tuned to work at full conversion of propane."

[6] "1.9 moles of ethane are produced per mole of propane consumed and 95% of the propane is converted by cross-metathesis, that is through its reaction with methane to produce two ethane molecules."

"Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs, and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This reaction involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleavage step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

"Cross-metathesis of methane and higher alkanes [48]: this reaction has been discovered using [TaH] and probably involves the reverse step of alkane metathesis."

"Non-oxidative coupling of methane [49]: this reaction is highly endothermic, leading to low conversions, and involves the CH activation of methane on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates."

[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

[4] "This selectivity is in contrast with that reported with tantalum hydride or tungsten hydride supported on oxide supports: 1)linear higher homologues are the major products; 2)higher homologues are mainly butanes and pentanes along with trace amounts of hexanes."

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28). In this case, the formation and the conversion of the alkene intermediates take place within the coordination sphere of the metal center"

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[4] "Detailed mechanistic studies using different types of Ta-based catalyst precursors and kinetic studies in flow reactors showed that alkenes were primary products and that the key CC bond cleavage and formation steps corresponded to those involved in alkene metathesis, i.e. [2 + 2]-cycloaddition and cycloreversion"

[5] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[6] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[7] "Here cyclic alkanes yield lower cyclic homologues: conversion of cyclohexane into methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane, and that of cycloheptane into methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane."

"Using a single site approach, we reported in 1997 the discovery of a new reaction, the alkane metathesis where a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(RSiO)2TaH] 1a, could catalytically transform at moderate temperatures any light alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

"This reaction consists mainly in the transfer of a single carbon from one chain to another, by both cleavage and formation of CH and CC bonds"

"kinetic studies on propane metathesis, carried out at extremely low contact time in a continuous flow reactor, revealed the primary products of the reaction, namely olefins and H2. This observation as well as elementary steps known in tantalum organometallic chemistry led us to propose a mechanism based on the following key steps: (i) paraffin dehydrogenation via CH bond activation leading to a metal-alkyl with subsequent formation of an olefin and a metal-hydride; (ii) olefin metathesis on a metallocarbene formed in parallel via a-H elimination from the metal-alkyl; and (iii) hydrogenation of the new olefins on the metal-hydride."

"Typically propane gives mainly ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and higher C5+ alkanes."

"Recently, we have developed a W(H)3/Al2O3500 catalyst, 1b, giving higher turnover numbers (TON) and having a much greater stability than Ta hydrides."

"The peculiarity of both systems lies in the fact that Ta or W hydrides are multifunctional–single site catalysts (alkane dehydrogenation, olefin metathesis and olefin hydrogenation)."

"One process, which allows alkane homologue redistribution is alkane metathesis. This process converts a given alkane into its lower and higher homologues."

"The first well-defined catalyst was based on a silica supported tantalum(III) monohydride [(SiO2)TaH] (1)"

"structurereactivity relationships have shown that low coordination electron-deficient metal centers are necessary, and that the addition of ancillary ligands is usually detrimental to catalytic performances."

"Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 8 h for 1."

"Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

"The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1: in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

"Note that treatment of well-defined silica supported perhydrocarbyl complexes of early transition metals under H2 gives hydrides along with (SiH), which has been explained by the reaction of putative metal hydride intermediates with adjacent siloxane bridges."

"We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12). Treatment of these two surface complexes under hydrogen at 150C overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum (111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si)(=Si-o-) Ta-H ([Ta],-H)"

          "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

          "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

          "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species"

          "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."

          "A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

          "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."

"Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

"Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

"The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

"Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

"Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

"Finally, 1a does not catalyze the metathesis of 2-methylpropane, a branched alkane, under the same reaction conditions, despite the presence of a reasonable amount of one of the initiation products."

"Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

"It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

"Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

"Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[6] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

"This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

"We previously described the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes in the presence of 1 and showed that successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time was preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like a β-alkyl transfer."

"In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."

"Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkane to 1 (Scheme 2, Pathway 2)13 could also take place and generate the surface intermediate 3. This process can also explain the formation of acyclic alkanes, and the smaller cyclic alkanes would have to be formed via a route similar to that delineated for a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, but in which the steps would involve successive oxidative addition and reductive elimination."

"Firstly, activation of a proton in the α, β or γ position in 4 (also called α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction18) generates alkylidene hydride,19 olefin hydride or metallacyclobutane20 (5) intermediates (Scheme 3)."

"While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

"We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes. A key feature is the ring contraction of cycloalkanes under hydrogenolysis conditions, which probably occurs via carbene intermediates (carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane)."

"Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes) and the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on 1 provides an aged catalyst with similar spectroscopic features to that of the model cyclopentadienyl surface complex 14, we propose that the deactivation observed in the hydrogenolysis of all cycloalkanes is most consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions."

[1] "A highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica, [(SiO)2TaH], catalytically transforms a given alkane into its higher and lower homologues—an alkane metathesis reaction."

[2] "This reaction involves selective cleavage and formation of carbon–carbon bonds; for example, propane metathesis selectively gives ethane (45–50%) and butanes (30–35%) along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes."

[4] "These selectivities are fully consistent with the model proposed earlier (Scheme 3), which is based on olefin metathesis intermediates and predicts that the favored pathway for the formation of higher homologues involves a 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutane rather than a 1,2-disubstituted one, as proposed in olefin metathesis."

[5] "The higher selectivity of linear over branched compounds is also consistent with this model, as the latter would involve the less-reactive disubstituted carbenes."

"Thus the reaction is believed to begin by the CH bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride leading to a surface tantalum alkyl complex [4,14,15]; a carbene hydride and an olefin hydride species can then result from a-H and b-H abstractions on this complex; classically, the interaction of the carbene and the olefin can lead to a tantallacyclobutane [16,17] which by decomposition will afford a new carbene and a new olefin; hydrogenation of these latter produces the new alkanes."

"Indeed, the selectivity of products in alkane metathesis is governed by the [1, 2] and [1, 3] interactions of methyl or ethyl substituents in the metallacyclobutanes intermediates, as in olefin metathesis [11]."

"Under similar conditions (970 equiv/Ta, 150 C, 5 d), 100 turnovers (TON) were obtained after 120 h, in place of 58 for 1 (Fig. 4a). This improvment is not due to a greater initial reaction rate, but to a slower deactivation, which manifests itself only after 20 h for 6 instead of 8 h for 1."

"Noteworthy: this system is more selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues (Fig. 4b): the overall selectivity in ethane and butanes is 80% and that of methane is only 10% for 6, in contrast to 1, for which they are 70 and 20%, respectively."

"The hydride 6 was also observed to be a poor hydrogenolysis catalyst compared to 1: in fact, the initial rate for the hydrogenolysis of propane is ca. 5 times greater for 1 than for 6 (19 h1 and 4 h1 respectively)."

"Note that treatment of well-defined silica supported perhydrocarbyl complexes of early transition metals under H2 gives hydrides along with (SiH), which has been explained by the reaction of putative metal hydride intermediates with adjacent siloxane bridges."

"We recently reported that the reaction of Ta(-CH,CMe,),(=CHCMe,) (Me, methyl) (1 0) with the surface hydroxyl groups of a dehydroxylated silica (1 1) leads to the formation of a mixture of two species: (Si-0-) Ta(-CH2CMe3),(=CHCMe,) (-65%) and (Si-0-),Ta(-CH2CMe3) (=CHCMe3) (-35%) (12). Treatment of these two surface complexes under hydrogen at 150C overnight yields mainly a surface tantalum (111) monohydride, (=Si-o-Si)(=Si-o-) Ta-H ([Ta],-H)"

          "When [Ta],-H was contacted at room temperature with a cyclic alkane (4, 13), no catalytic reaction occurred. Only a C-H bond activation was observed, which led to the stoichiometric formation of a tantalum (111)-cycloalkyl species with the evolution of 1 mol of hydrogen."

          "When [Ta],-H was contacted with an acyclic alkane, a catalytic metathesis reaction occurred at moderate temperature (25" to 200C), leading to the formation of the higher and lower homologs (Table 1)."

          "Regarding the mechanism of the reaction (15) (Scheme I), we assume that in a first step, a C-H bond of acyclic alkane (for example, ethane) is cleaved by a a-bond metathesis, producing hydrogen and a tantalum-alkyl (for example, ethyl) species"

          "The next step involves the transfer of a methyl group and necessarily implies the cleavage and the formation of C-C bonds."

          "A a-bond metathesis mechanism, which we prefer because of the highly electrophilic character of the silica-supported tantalum-alkyl species, would involve a four-centered transition state with the presence of an sp3 carbon in the middle of the metallocycle (Scheme 2)."

          "Such a mechanism is also operating in the case of higher alkanes. For example, the formation of n-butane and isobutane from propane is determined in the first step of C-H bond activation, which yields two species, tantalum-n-propyl and tantalum-isopropyl surface complexes (Scheme 3)."

"Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

"Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

"The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

"Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

"Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

"Finally, 1a does not catalyze the metathesis of 2-methylpropane, a branched alkane, under the same reaction conditions, despite the presence of a reasonable amount of one of the initiation products."

"Recent kinetic and mechanistic studies in our laboratories12,14 have shown that the key carboncarbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, that is, a [2+2] cycloreversion and a cycloaddition step."

"It has been proposed that an alkyl species is formed by CH activation of alkanes, which, by a subsequent β-H or α-H transfer step, yields the olefin or a hydridocarbene intermediate, the necessary propagating center for olefin metathesis (Scheme 1c). The corresponding reverse step yields the alkane metathesis product."

"Notably, and in contrast to the Chevron process, alkane metathesis is carried out on a dual catalyst based on a single metal having all the necessary properties (CH activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation), and moreover, these catalytic systems can be used to incorporate methane into higher homologues."

"Finally, these systems are selective towards Cn1 and Cn+1 homologues, because the major pathway involves the cross-metathesis of the terminal olefin (R=Cn2, Scheme 1c) and the alkylidene species resulting from the activation of the terminal CH bond of the alkane (R=Cn1, Scheme 1c)"

[1] "First, the two-site mechanism is proposed to involve tantalum hydrides as key intermediates (Scheme 27c). After a first CH bond activation to form H2 and Ta-alkyl surface species, one site generates an alkene via a β-H transfer, thus regenerating tantalum hydrides; the other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer."

[2] "Second, the one-site mechanism is based on tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates, which are formed in situ from either silica supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes (Scheme 28)."

[3] "Both mechanisms are based on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as a key intermediate."

[4] "The selectivity in higher homologues, i.e. the presence of mainly n  1 and n + 1 linear homologues, is fully consistent with the fact that alkene metathesis is the key homologation process and that 1-alkenes are mainly participating in the homologation process"

[5] "Moreover, various cyclic alkanes, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cycloheptane, with the exception of cyclopentane also undergo hydrogenolysis with this catalyst, albeit with much lower rates and number of turnovers."

[6] "It has been proposed that the key step probably involved, after the formation of the cycloalkyl derivatives via CH bond activation, a γ-H activation (Scheme 26). This yields a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps, e.g. hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement, to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues."

"This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

"We previously described the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes in the presence of 1 and showed that successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time was preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like a β-alkyl transfer."

"In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."

"Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkane to 1 (Scheme 2, Pathway 2)13 could also take place and generate the surface intermediate 3. This process can also explain the formation of acyclic alkanes, and the smaller cyclic alkanes would have to be formed via a route similar to that delineated for a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, but in which the steps would involve successive oxidative addition and reductive elimination."

"Firstly, activation of a proton in the α, β or γ position in 4 (also called α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction18) generates alkylidene hydride,19 olefin hydride or metallacyclobutane20 (5) intermediates (Scheme 3)."

"While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

"We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes. A key feature is the ring contraction of cycloalkanes under hydrogenolysis conditions, which probably occurs via carbene intermediates (carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane)."

"Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes) and the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on 1 provides an aged catalyst with similar spectroscopic features to that of the model cyclopentadienyl surface complex 14, we propose that the deactivation observed in the hydrogenolysis of all cycloalkanes is most consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions."
