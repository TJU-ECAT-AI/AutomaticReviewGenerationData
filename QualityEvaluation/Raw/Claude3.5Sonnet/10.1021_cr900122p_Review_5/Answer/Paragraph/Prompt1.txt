This contrasts with two-site schemes like the Chevron process, which uses separate catalysts for dehydrogenation/hydrogenation and metathesis.\n\nThe reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the major pathway involving cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal CH bonds in alkanes (Cn-1).\n\nKey intermediates in this process include olefins, hydridocarbenes, and likely metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in the overall transformation. The catalyst's ability to incorporate methane into higher homologues demonstrates its versatility in alkane conversions.\n\nWhile the information provided doesn't specifically address cyclic alkane transformations, the general mechanism should apply to both linear and cyclic systems, with potential differences in reactivity and selectivity based on structural constraints.\n\nThe catalyst's performance and efficiency in various alkane conversions are influenced by its ability to balance the rates of each step in the catalytic cycle, maintain active sites, and resist deactivation under reaction conditions.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.200602155"},
