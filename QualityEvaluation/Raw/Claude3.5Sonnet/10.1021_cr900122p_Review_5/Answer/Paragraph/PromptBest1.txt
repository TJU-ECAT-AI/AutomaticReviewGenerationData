The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps and intermediates, operating through both one-site and two-site schemes. This process allows for the transformation of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under relatively mild conditions.

Key aspects of the mechanism include:

1. Initiation: The highly electrophilic tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH] supported on silica acts as the catalyst precursor, capable of activating alkane C-H bonds at low temperatures (25-80°C) [10.1002/anie.200501382].

2. C-H Bond Activation: This step involves the formation of surface tantalum alkyl complexes with the evolution of molecular hydrogen [10.1002/chem.200390162].

3. Formation of Key Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through several crucial intermediates:
   a) Metallocarbenes and metallacyclobutanes, similar to olefin metathesis [10.1002/anie.200501382].
   b) Alkenes and alkylidene hydrides, formed through β-H or α-H transfer processes [10.1021/cr900122].
   c) Olefin hydrides, resulting from β-H transfer [10.1002/chem.200390162].

4. C-C Bond Cleavage and Formation: The key step involves π-bond metathesis between olefin and carbene intermediates, proceeding through [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion steps [10.1002/anie.200602155].

5. Product Formation: Metallacyclobutanes undergo cycloreversion to form new alkanes and regenerate the active catalyst species [10.1002/anie.200501382].

The mechanism can operate through both one-site and two-site pathways:

- One-site mechanism: All steps occur within the coordination sphere of a single metal center [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
- Two-site mechanism: One site generates alkenes via β-H transfer, while another forms alkylidene hydrides via α-H transfer [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

For linear alkanes, the process shows selectivity towards Cn±1 homologues, with 1-alkenes being the primary participants in the metathesis step [10.1021/cr900122p_5]. For example, propane metathesis selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes [10.1002/anie.200501382].

Cyclic alkane transformations follow a similar mechanism but with some key differences:
- Lower reaction rates and turnover numbers compared to linear alkanes [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
- Ring contraction occurs, likely through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways [10.1002/chem.200390162].
- γ-H activation plays a crucial role in forming metallacyclobutane intermediates for cyclic alkanes [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on several factors:
1. The electrophilicity of the tantalum center [10.1002/anie.200501382].
2. The stability and reactivity of key intermediates [10.1002/anie.200501382].
3. Steric factors in metallacyclobutane formation [10.1002/anie.200602171].
4. The structure of the alkane (linear vs. branched) [10.1002/anie.200602171].
5. The chain length of the alkane [10.1002/anie.200602171].
6. Support material and metal used [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
7. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure) [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst system represents a significant advancement in alkane activation and transformation. Its ability to perform multiple functions (C-H activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) on a single metal center opens up new possibilities for alkane valorization.

Future research directions may include:
1. Catalyst optimization: Developing new support materials or modifying the tantalum center to enhance stability and selectivity.
2. Expanding substrate scope: Investigating the catalyst's performance on more complex alkanes or other hydrocarbon feedstocks.
3. Mechanistic studies: Further elucidating the roles of various intermediates, particularly in cyclic alkane transformations.
4. Process intensification: Exploring continuous flow reactors or membrane systems to improve efficiency and product separation.
5. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced simulations to predict catalyst behavior and guide design improvements.
6. Green chemistry applications: Investigating the potential for using this catalyst in the upcycling of plastic waste or biomass-derived alkanes.

These advancements could lead to more efficient utilization of alkane resources, potentially revolutionizing petrochemical processes and contributing to the development of more sustainable chemical transformations.

3. The process involves γ-H activation, leading to metallacyclobutane intermediates that can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on several factors:
1. The electrophilicity of the tantalum center

6. The chain length of the alkane
[10.1002/anie.200501382] [10.1002/anie.200602171]

The catalyst's performance is also influenced by its ability to resist deactivation. For cyclic alkanes, the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions is proposed as the main cause of catalyst deactivation [10.1002/chem.200390162].

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps and intermediates. This process can occur through both one-site and two-site mechanisms, each with distinct characteristics and implications for catalyst performance.

One-site mechanism:
In this scheme, all catalytic steps occur on a single tantalum center. The process begins with C-H bond activation of the alkane by the tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH], forming a surface tantalum alkyl complex [10.1002/anie.200460982]. This is followed by either α-H or β-H transfer, yielding carbene hydride or olefin hydride species, respectively. These intermediates then undergo olefin metathesis, involving [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion steps, similar to traditional olefin metathesis [10.1002/anie.200602155]. The key feature of this mechanism is that all transformations occur within the coordination sphere of a single metal center.

Two-site mechanism:
This scheme involves cooperation between two tantalum sites. After initial C-H bond activation, one site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides. The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer. The alkene then undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene on the second site, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

Key intermediates and their roles:
1. Tantalum alkyl complexes: Formed through initial C-H bond activation.
2. Carbene and olefin intermediates: Critical for the metathesis process.
3. Metallacyclobutanes: Formed during the metathesis step, these are crucial for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation.

The reaction exhibits selectivity towards Cn±1 homologues, primarily due to the participation of 1-alkenes in the metathesis process [10.1002/anie.200602155]. This selectivity is influenced by the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones [10.1002/anie.200501382].

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism involves additional complexity. After initial C-H activation forming cycloalkyl derivatives, γ-H activation leads to metallacyclobutane intermediates. These can undergo cycloreversion, hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation, and rearrangement to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues [10.1021/cr900122p_5]. However, cyclic alkanes generally react more slowly and with lower turnover numbers compared to linear alkanes [10.1002/chem.200390162].

Factors influencing catalyst performance and selectivity include:
1. Support material (e.g., silica, alumina)
2. Metal center (Ta, W, etc.)
3. Ligand environment
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)
5. Alkane structure (linear vs. branched, chain length)

The highly electrophilic nature of the tantalum center is crucial for its catalytic activity [10.1002/anie.200501382]. However, this also makes the catalyst susceptible to deactivation, particularly in the case of cyclic alkanes, where cyclopentadienyl species can form and render the catalyst inactive [10.1002/chem.200390162].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The comprehensive study of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides has revealed a complex and versatile catalytic system capable of transforming both linear and cyclic alkanes. The ability of these catalysts to perform multiple functions (C-H activation, dehydrogenation, metathesis, and hydrogenation) on a single metal center sets them apart from traditional multi-component systems.

Looking forward, several avenues for future research and development emerge:

1. Catalyst design: The understanding of structure-reactivity relationships could guide the development of more efficient and stable catalysts. This might involve exploring new support materials, modifying the electronic properties of the metal center, or introducing ancillary ligands to fine-tune reactivity.

2. Mechanism elucidation: While significant progress has been made in understanding the reaction mechanism, further studies using advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling could provide deeper insights into the formation and transformation of key intermediates.

3. Expanding substrate scope: The differences observed between linear and cyclic alkanes suggest potential for tailoring catalysts for specific substrate classes. Future work could focus on developing catalysts optimized for branched alkanes or larger cyclic systems.

4. Addressing deactivation: The identification of cyclopentadienyl species as a source of catalyst deactivation opens up possibilities for developing strategies to mitigate this issue, potentially through catalyst regeneration methods or modified reaction conditions.

5. Application in alkane upgrading: The ability of these catalysts to redistribute carbon chains could find applications in upgrading low-value alkanes to more valuable products. This could have significant implications for the petrochemical industry and the utilization of unconventional hydrocarbon resources.

6. Integration with other processes: Exploring the combination of alkane metathesis with other transformations in one-pot reactions could lead to new, more efficient pathways for complex molecule synthesis from simple alkane feedstocks.

These directions highlight the potential for silica-supported tantalum hydride catalysts to play a significant role in future alkane conversion technologies, offering new possibilities for sustainable chemical production and energy applications.

The key carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming steps correspond to those of olefin metathesis, involving a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism [10.1002/anie.200602155]. This process occurs through π-bond metathesis between the metallacarbene and the alkene intermediates [10.1351/pac-con-08-07-18].

5. Product Formation:
The metallacyclobutane intermediates decompose to yield new carbenes and olefins. Subsequent hydrogenation of these olefins produces new alkanes [10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4].

Two possible mechanistic schemes have been proposed:

1. Two-site mechanism:
- One site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides
- The other site evolves toward a Ta-alkylidene hydride via an α-H transfer
- Alkene undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes [10.1021/cr900122p_5]

2. One-site mechanism:
- Tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates form in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes
- Alkene formation and conversion occur within the metal's coordination sphere [10.1021/cr900122p_5]

For linear alkanes, the process is selective for n±1 homologues, indicating that 1-alkenes are the primary participants in the metathesis step [10.1021/cr900122p_5]. For example, propane metathesis selectively produces ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%), along with methane and minor amounts of higher alkanes [10.1002/anie.200501382].

Cyclic alkane transformations follow a similar mechanism but with some key differences:
- Cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with lower rates and turnover numbers compared to acyclic alkanes
- Ring contraction is a key feature, likely occurring via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways
- γ-H activation leads to the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues [10.1021/cr900122p_5]

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors:
1. The electrophilicity of the tantalum center
2. The stability and reactivity of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates
3. The preference for 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones
4. The relative rates of formation and decomposition of various intermediates
5. The structure of the alkane (linear vs. branched)
6. The chain length of the alkane
7. Support material (silica, alumina, etc.)
8. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)

These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis process, with the catalyst showing high activity for linear alkanes but limited effectiveness for very short chain or branched alkanes [10.1002/anie.200602171].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides represents a significant advancement in C-C bond activation and formation under relatively mild conditions. This process offers a unique approach to alkane homologue redistribution, which could have important implications for the valorization of light alkanes and the production of higher-value hydrocarbons.

Future research directions may include:

1. Catalyst design: Developing new catalysts with improved stability, activity, and selectivity by fine-tuning the metal center, support material, and ligand environment. This could involve exploring other early transition metals or bimetallic systems.

2. Mechanistic studies: Further investigation into the details of the one-site and two-site mechanisms, possibly using advanced spectroscopic techniques or computational modeling to elucidate the precise nature of the active sites and intermediates.

3. Substrate scope expansion: Exploring the potential for this catalytic system to transform more complex hydrocarbons, including those derived from biomass or waste plastics.

4. Process intensification: Developing continuous-flow reactors or membrane reactors to improve the efficiency and scalability of the alkane metathesis process.

5. Integration with other processes: Investigating the potential for combining alkane metathesis with other catalytic transformations to create more complex and valuable products in a single process.

6. Addressing catalyst deactivation: Developing strategies to mitigate the formation of inactive species, particularly in cycloalkane transformations, to improve catalyst longevity and overall process economics.

7. Theoretical studies: Employing advanced computational methods to predict and design catalysts with optimal electronic and steric properties for specific alkane transformations.

These research directions could potentially lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for upgrading light hydrocarbons, contributing to the development of cleaner and more versatile technologies for the petrochemical industry.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps that can proceed through both one-site and two-site schemes. The catalyst, typically a highly electrophilic tantalum hydride supported on silica [(SiO)2TaH], demonstrates remarkable reactivity towards both linear and cyclic alkanes.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism involves:

1. C-H Bond Activation: The process begins with the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes at low temperatures (25-80°C), forming surface tantalum-alkyl complexes with the evolution of molecular hydrogen [10.1002/chem.200390162].

2. Formation of Key Intermediates: This activation leads to the formation of various intermediates, including carbenes, alkenes, and metallacyclobutanes [10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4].

3. Olefin Metathesis: The key carbon-carbon bond-breaking and bond-making steps occur through a [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition mechanism, similar to traditional olefin metathesis [10.1002/anie.200602155].

4. Product Formation: The metallacyclobutanes undergo cycloreversion to form new alkanes and regenerate the active catalyst species [10.1002/anie.200501382].

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism is more complex:

1. C-C Bond Activation: This can occur through σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, leading to ring-opened intermediates [10.1002/chem.200390162].

2. Intramolecular Rearrangements: These intermediates can undergo further intramolecular C-C or C-H bond activations, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic alkanes [10.1002/chem.200390162].

3. Ring Contraction: A key feature of cycloalkane transformation is ring contraction, likely occurring via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways [10.1002/chem.200390162].

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by several factors:

1. Alkane Structure: Linear alkanes generally show higher reactivity compared to cyclic alkanes [10.1002/anie.200602171].

2. Ring Size: For cyclic alkanes, larger rings tend to be more reactive [10.1002/chem.200390162].

3. Steric Factors: The formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes is favored over 1,2-disubstituted ones, influencing product selectivity [10.1002/anie.200501382].

4. Support Material: The nature of the silica support provides site isolation and influences the stability of key intermediates [10.1351/pac-con-08-07-18].

5. Reaction Conditions: Temperature and pressure affect the formation of active species and overall catalyst performance [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

The mechanism demonstrates a preference for the formation of Cn±1 homologues, particularly for linear alkanes, due to the participation of 1-alkenes in the metathesis process [10.1021/cr900122p_5]. However, the catalyst struggles with very short chain alkanes (like ethane) and branched alkanes (like 2-methylpropane) [10.1002/anie.200602171].

Catalyst deactivation, especially in cycloalkane transformations, is attributed to the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl species, particularly from cyclopentane [10.1002/chem.200390162].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides represents a significant advancement in C-C bond activation and formation under mild conditions. This system's ability to transform both linear and cyclic alkanes opens up new possibilities for alkane valorization and the potential incorporation of methane into higher homologues.

Future research directions may include:

1. Catalyst Design: Developing new catalysts with improved stability and selectivity, possibly by exploring different support materials or incorporating additional metals to create bimetallic systems.

2. Mechanistic Studies: Further investigation into the precise nature of the active sites and the role of the support in stabilizing key intermediates could lead to more efficient catalyst designs.

3. In-situ Characterization: Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques to observe the formation and transformation of intermediates in real-time could provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism.

4. Computational Modeling: Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict and understand the energetics of different reaction pathways could guide the development of more selective catalysts.

5. Application to Other Substrates: Exploring the potential of this catalytic system for the transformation of more complex hydrocarbons or even biomass-derived molecules could open up new avenues for sustainable chemical production.

6. Process Intensification: Investigating the use of continuous flow reactors or membrane reactors to improve the efficiency and scalability of the alkane metathesis process.

7. Coupling with Other Reactions: Exploring the potential of combining alkane metathesis with other transformations in one-pot reactions could lead to novel synthetic pathways for valuable chemicals.

These research directions could potentially lead to more efficient and selective catalytic systems for alkane conversion, contributing to the broader goal of utilizing abundant hydrocarbon resources more effectively and sustainably.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps and processes that allow for the transformation of alkanes into their lower and higher homologues. This mechanism can be described through both two-site and one-site schemes, each with its own unique features and implications for catalyst performance.

Two-site mechanism:
1. C-H bond activation: The reaction begins with the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes, forming Ta-alkyl surface species and releasing H2 [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
2. Alkene formation: One catalytic site generates an alkene via β-H transfer, regenerating tantalum hydrides [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
3. Alkylidene formation: The other site forms a Ta-alkylidene hydride via α-H transfer [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
4. Metathesis: The alkene undergoes metathesis with the alkylidene, producing new alkenes and alkylidenes [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

One-site mechanism:
1. Formation of key intermediates: Tantalum alkyl alkylidene intermediates form in situ from either silica-supported tantalum hydrides or neopentyl neopentylidene tantalum surface complexes [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
2. Alkene formation and conversion: These processes occur within the coordination sphere of the metal center [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

Both mechanisms rely on alkene metathesis and alkylidene hydride as key intermediates [10.1021/cr900122p_5]. The process involves the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates, which undergo [2+2] cycloreversion and cycloaddition steps, similar to traditional olefin metathesis [10.1002/anie.200602155].

For linear alkanes, the reaction shows selectivity towards Cn-1 and Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the cross-metathesis between terminal olefins (Cn-2) and alkylidene species formed from the activation of terminal C-H bonds in alkanes (Cn-1) [10.1002/anie.200602155]. This selectivity is influenced by the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones [10.1002/anie.200501382].

3. γ-H activation leads to the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates, which can undergo cycloreversion and subsequent steps to yield both lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

The formation and role of key intermediates are crucial for the overall catalytic process:
1. Alkenes: Formed through β-H transfer and serve as primary products and reactants in the metathesis step [10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4].
2. Carbenes: Generated through α-H transfer and participate in the metathesis reaction [10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4].
3. Metallacyclobutanes: Formed through the interaction of carbenes and alkenes, these intermediates are central to the C-C bond cleavage and formation process [10.1002/anie.200501382].

Factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance include:
1. The electrophilicity of the tantalum center [10.1002/anie.200501382].
2. The stability and reactivity of metallocarbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates [10.1002/anie.200501382].
3. The preference for 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones [10.1002/anie.200501382].
4. The relative rates of formation and decomposition of various intermediates [10.1002/anie.200501382].
5. Support material (silica, alumina, etc.) [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
6. Metal used (Ta, W, Mo, etc.) [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
7. Ligand environment (hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes) [10.1021/cr900122p_5].
8. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure) [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

These factors collectively influence the catalyst's ability to perform various alkane conversions efficiently and selectively.

The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex series of steps and intermediates, operating through both one-site and two-site schemes. The process begins with C-H bond activation of alkanes by the highly electrophilic tantalum hydride [(SiO)2TaH], forming surface tantalum-alkyl species [10.1002/anie.200501382]. This initial step is crucial for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism proceeds as follows:
1. C-H bond activation forms tantalum-alkyl species.
2. α-H or β-H transfer generates carbene hydride or olefin hydride intermediates, respectively.
3. Olefin metathesis occurs through metallacyclobutane intermediates, involving [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion steps [10.1002/anie.200602155].
4. Hydrogenation of the resulting olefins produces new alkanes.

The reaction shows selectivity towards Cn±1 homologues, with propane metathesis typically yielding ethane (45-50%) and butanes (30-35%) [10.1002/anie.200501382]. This selectivity is attributed to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones [10.1002/anie.200501382].

For cyclic alkanes, the mechanism is more complex:
1. C-H bond activation forms cycloalkyl derivatives.
2. γ-H activation leads to metallacyclobutane intermediates.
3. Cycloreversion, hydrogenolysis, and rearrangement steps yield lower cyclic and acyclic alkane homologues [10.1021/cr900122p_5].

The reaction proceeds more slowly for cyclic alkanes compared to linear ones, with ring contraction being a key feature [10.1002/chem.200390162].

The catalyst's performance and selectivity are influenced by several factors:
1. The nature of the support material (e.g., silica, alumina)
2. The metal used (Ta, W, Mo)
3. The ligand environment (hydrides, alkyls, alkylidenes)
4. Reaction conditions (temperature, pressure)
5. Alkane structure (linear vs. branched, chain length)

The formation and stability of key intermediates, particularly carbenes and metallacyclobutanes, play a crucial role in determining the catalyst's efficiency and product distribution [10.1007/s11244-006-0108-4].
