[1] "Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs, and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This reaction involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleavage step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

[2] "Cross-metathesis of methane and higher alkanes [48]: this reaction has been discovered using [TaH] and probably involves the reverse step of alkane metathesis."

[3] "Non-oxidative coupling of methane [49]: this reaction is highly endothermic, leading to low conversions, and involves the CH activation of methane on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Formation of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates: The [TaH] species activates the alkane to form a Ta=CHR carbene and an alkene.

2. π-bond metathesis: The key C-C bond formation/cleavage step occurs through π-bond metathesis between the metallacarbene and an alkene.

3. Chain growth and degradation: This process results in the formation of lower and higher homologs of the starting alkane.

4. Cyclic vs. linear alkanes: While not explicitly stated, the mechanism likely differs for cyclic alkanes, potentially involving ring-opening steps.

5. Methane involvement: Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes is possible, likely through the reverse of the alkane metathesis steps.

6. C-H activation: Non-oxidative coupling of methane involves C-H activation on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on:

- Temperature: Higher temperatures (e.g., 150°C) are required for efficient alkane metathesis.
- Substrate: Different alkanes (linear, branched, cyclic) may show varying reactivity.
- Intermediate stability: The relative stability of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates affects product distribution.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss one-site vs. two-site mechanisms, the description suggests a primarily one-site process where all steps occur on a single Ta center. However, the possibility of alkene migration between sites cannot be ruled out based on the given information.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 金属卡宾和烯烃中间体的形成：[TaH]物种活化烷烃形成Ta=CHR卡宾和一个烯烃。

2. π键复分解：关键的C-C键形成/断裂步骤通过金属卡宾和烯烃之间的π键复分解发生。

3. 链增长和降解：这个过程导致形成起始烷烃的低级和高级同系物。

4. 环状vs.直链烷烃：虽然没有明确说明，但对于环状烷烃，机理可能不同，可能涉及开环步骤。

5. 甲烷参与：甲烷与高级烷烃的交叉复分解是可能的，可能通过烷烃复分解步骤的逆过程进行。

6. C-H活化：甲烷的非氧化偶联涉及Ta卡宾或卡拜中间体上的C-H活化。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能取决于：

- 温度：需要较高温度（如150°C）才能进行有效的烷烃复分解。
- 底物：不同的烷烃（直链、支链、环状）可能表现出不同的反应活性。
- 中间体稳定性：金属卡宾和烯烃中间体的相对稳定性影响产物分布。

虽然文献没有明确讨论单位点vs.双位点机制，但描述暗示主要是单位点过程，所有步骤都发生在单个Ta中心。然而，根据给定信息，不能排除烯烃在位点之间迁移的可能性。
