[1] "Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs, and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This reaction involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleavage step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

[2] "Cross-metathesis of methane and higher alkanes [48]: this reaction has been discovered using [TaH] and probably involves the reverse step of alkane metathesis."

[3] "Non-oxidative coupling of methane [49]: this reaction is highly endothermic, leading to low conversions, and involves the CH activation of methane on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Formation of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates: The tantalum hydride species activates the alkane to form these reactive intermediates.

2. π-bond metathesis: This is the crucial step for CC bond formation and cleavage. It likely involves the interaction of the metallacarbene with an alkene to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then cleaves to form new alkenes.

3. CH activation: This occurs particularly with methane, forming Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates.

4. Alkane transformation: The process converts alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is converted mainly into ethane and butane.

5. Reverse reactions: Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes involves the reverse of the alkane metathesis steps.

The mechanism can operate through both one-site and two-site schemes:

One-site scheme: A single Ta center performs all steps of the catalytic cycle.

Two-site scheme: Different Ta centers may be involved in different steps, with alkenes or other intermediates migrating between sites.

For linear alkanes, the process involves successive CC bond breaking and forming steps to yield shorter and longer chain products. Cyclic alkanes likely undergo ring-opening followed by similar linear alkane processes.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by:

1. The ability to form and stabilize metallacarbene intermediates
2. The rate of π-bond metathesis reactions
3. The stability and reactivity of metallacyclobutane intermediates
4. The rate of CH activation, particularly for methane coupling

These factors contribute to the observed product distributions in various alkane conversions, such as the formation of mainly ethane and butane from propane, and the ability to perform cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 金属卡宾和烯烃中间体的形成：钽氢化物物种活化烷烃形成这些反应性中间体。

2. π键复分解：这是CC键形成和断裂的关键步骤。它可能涉及金属卡宾与烯烃的相互作用形成金属环丁烷中间体，然后裂解形成新的烯烃。

3. CH活化：这特别发生在甲烷上，形成钽卡宾或卡拜中间体。

4. 烷烃转化：该过程将烷烃转化为其低级和高级同系物。例如，丙烷主要转化为乙烷和丁烷。

5. 逆反应：甲烷与高级烷烃的交叉复分解涉及烷烃复分解步骤的逆过程。

该机理可以通过单点和双点方案进行：

单点方案：单个钽中心执行催化循环的所有步骤。

双点方案：不同的钽中心可能参与不同的步骤，烯烃或其他中间体在位点之间迁移。

对于直链烷烃，该过程涉及连续的CC键断裂和形成步骤，以产生较短和较长链的产物。环烷烃可能经历开环，然后进行类似的直链烷烃过程。

催化剂的选择性和性能受以下因素影响：

1. 形成和稳定金属卡宾中间体的能力
2. π键复分解反应的速率
3. 金属环丁烷中间体的稳定性和反应性
4. CH活化的速率，特别是对于甲烷偶联

这些因素影响了各种烷烃转化中观察到的产物分布，例如从丙烷主要形成乙烷和丁烷，以及进行甲烷与高级烷烃交叉复分解的能力。
