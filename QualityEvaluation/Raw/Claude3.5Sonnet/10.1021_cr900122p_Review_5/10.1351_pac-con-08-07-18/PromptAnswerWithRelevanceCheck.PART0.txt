[1] "Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs, and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This reaction involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleavage step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

[2] "Cross-metathesis of methane and higher alkanes [48]: this reaction has been discovered using [TaH] and probably involves the reverse step of alkane metathesis."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Formation of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates: The [TaH] species activates the alkane to form a Ta=CHR carbene and an alkene.

2. π-bond metathesis: The key C-C bond formation/cleavage step occurs through π-bond metathesis between the metallacarbene and an alkene.

3. Chain growth and degradation: This process results in the formation of lower and higher homologs of the starting alkane.

4. Cyclic vs. linear alkanes: While not explicitly stated, the mechanism likely differs for cyclic alkanes, potentially involving ring-opening steps.

5. Methane involvement: Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes is possible, likely through the reverse of the alkane metathesis steps.

6. C-H activation: Non-oxidative coupling of methane involves C-H activation on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions depend on:

- Temperature: Higher temperatures (e.g., 150°C) are required for efficient alkane metathesis.
- Substrate: Different alkanes (linear, branched, cyclic) may show varying reactivity.
- Intermediate stability: The relative stability of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates affects product distribution.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss one-site vs. two-site mechanisms, the description suggests a primarily one-site process where all steps occur on a single Ta center. However, the possibility of alkene migration between sites cannot be ruled out based on the given information.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane activation: The Ta-H species activates C-H bonds in alkanes to form Ta-alkyl intermediates.

2. β-hydride elimination: These Ta-alkyl species can undergo β-hydride elimination to form alkene intermediates and regenerate the Ta-H active site.

3. Olefin metathesis: The alkene intermediates undergo olefin metathesis with Ta=CHR carbene species to form metallacyclobutanes, which then cleave to yield new alkenes.

4. Hydrogenation: The newly formed alkenes are hydrogenated by Ta-H to form new alkanes.

This cycle can occur through both one-site and two-site mechanisms:

One-site: All steps occur on a single Ta center, with the Ta alternating between hydride, alkyl, carbene, and metallacyclobutane states.

Two-site: Alkane activation and hydrogenation occur on Ta-H sites, while olefin metathesis occurs on separate Ta=CHR carbene sites. Alkenes shuttle between the two types of sites.

For linear alkanes, this process leads to the formation of lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is converted to a mixture of mainly ethane and butane. 

Cyclic alkanes can also undergo ring-opening metathesis to form linear products.

The selectivity is influenced by the relative rates of alkane activation, β-hydride elimination, olefin metathesis, and hydrogenation steps. Slower β-hydride elimination favors alkane redistribution over complete fragmentation to methane.

Catalyst performance is affected by factors like the Ta-H and Ta=CHR site densities, their stability under reaction conditions, and the accessibility of the active sites.

The mechanism also enables related reactions like cross-metathesis between methane and higher alkanes, and non-oxidative coupling of methane, though the latter suffers from thermodynamic limitations.

Overall, the unique ability of supported Ta-H species to perform both C-H activation and olefin metathesis allows for the direct transformation of unactivated alkanes under relatively mild conditions.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 烷烃活化：Ta-H物种活化烷烃中的C-H键，形成Ta-烷基中间体。

2. β-氢消除：这些Ta-烷基物种可以进行β-氢消除，形成烯烃中间体并再生Ta-H活性位点。

3. 烯烃复分解：烯烃中间体与Ta=CHR卡宾物种进行烯烃复分解，形成金属环丁烷，然后裂解产生新的烯烃。

4. 加氢：新形成的烯烃被Ta-H加氢形成新的烷烃。

这个循环可以通过单位点和双位点机制进行：

单位点：所有步骤都发生在单个Ta中心上，Ta在氢化物、烷基、卡宾和金属环丁烷状态之间交替。

双位点：烷烃活化和加氢发生在Ta-H位点上，而烯烃复分解发生在独立的Ta=CHR卡宾位点上。烯烃在两种类型的位点之间穿梭。

对于直链烷烃，这个过程导致形成较低和较高的同系物。例如，丙烷被转化为主要由乙烷和丁烷组成的混合物。

环烷烃也可以进行开环复分解形成直链产物。

选择性受烷烃活化、β-氢消除、烯烃复分解和加氢步骤的相对速率影响。较慢的β-氢消除有利于烷烃重分配而不是完全碎片化为甲烷。

催化剂性能受到Ta-H和Ta=CHR位点密度、它们在反应条件下的稳定性以及活性位点的可及性等因素的影响。

该机制还能实现相关反应，如甲烷与高级烷烃之间的交叉复分解，以及甲烷的非氧化偶联，尽管后者受到热力学限制。

总的来说，负载的Ta-H物种独特的能力，即同时进行C-H活化和烯烃复分解，允许在相对温和的条件下直接转化未活化的烷烃。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Alkane activation: The tantalum hydride species activates the C-H bond of the alkane, likely through a σ-bond metathesis mechanism.

2. Formation of intermediates: This activation leads to the formation of tantalum alkyl species and metallacarbenes.

3. Alkene formation: β-hydrogen elimination from the tantalum alkyl species produces alkenes as intermediates.

4. π-bond metathesis: The key C-C bond formation/cleavage step occurs through π-bond metathesis between the metallacarbene and the alkene intermediates. This step is crucial for redistributing carbon atoms.

5. Metallacyclobutane formation: The π-bond metathesis likely proceeds through metallacyclobutane intermediates, similar to alkene metathesis mechanisms.

6. Product formation: The metallacyclobutane intermediates then break down to form new alkanes and regenerate the tantalum carbene species.

This mechanism can operate through both one-site and two-site pathways:

- One-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single tantalum center.
- Two-site mechanism: Alkane activation and alkene formation occur on one site, while carbene formation and metathesis occur on another.

For linear alkanes, this process results in the formation of lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane. The selectivity is influenced by the relative rates of alkane activation, alkene formation, and metathesis steps.

Cyclic alkanes can undergo similar transformations, potentially leading to ring opening or redistribution of carbon atoms in the ring.

The catalyst's performance is affected by factors such as:
- The nature of the silica support, which provides site isolation
- The reactivity of the tantalum hydride species
- The stability of the various intermediates

The system also shows interesting reactivity in related processes:
- Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes, likely involving similar intermediates
- Non-oxidative coupling of methane, which involves C-H activation on tantalum carbene or carbyne intermediates, though this process is less efficient due to its endothermic nature.

Overall, the silica-supported tantalum hydride system demonstrates remarkable activity in alkane transformation, enabled by its ability to form and stabilize highly reactive intermediates through site isolation on the silica surface.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Formation of metallacarbene and alkene intermediates: The tantalum hydride species activates the alkane to form these reactive intermediates.

2. π-bond metathesis: This is the crucial step for CC bond formation and cleavage. It likely involves the interaction of the metallacarbene with an alkene to form a metallacyclobutane intermediate, which then cleaves to form new alkenes.

3. CH activation: This occurs particularly with methane, forming Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates.

4. Alkane transformation: The process converts alkanes into their lower and higher homologs. For example, propane is converted mainly into ethane and butane.

5. Reverse reactions: Cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes involves the reverse of the alkane metathesis steps.

The mechanism can operate through both one-site and two-site schemes:

One-site scheme: A single Ta center performs all steps of the catalytic cycle.

Two-site scheme: Different Ta centers may be involved in different steps, with alkenes or other intermediates migrating between sites.

For linear alkanes, the process involves successive CC bond breaking and forming steps to yield shorter and longer chain products. Cyclic alkanes likely undergo ring-opening followed by similar linear alkane processes.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst are influenced by:

1. The ability to form and stabilize metallacarbene intermediates
2. The rate of π-bond metathesis reactions
3. The stability and reactivity of metallacyclobutane intermediates
4. The rate of CH activation, particularly for methane coupling

These factors contribute to the observed product distributions in various alkane conversions, such as the formation of mainly ethane and butane from propane, and the ability to perform cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes.
