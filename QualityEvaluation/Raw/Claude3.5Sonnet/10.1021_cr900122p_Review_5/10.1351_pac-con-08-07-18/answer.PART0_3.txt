[1] "Alkane metathesis: at 150 C, [TaH] transforms an alkane into its lower and higher homologs, and, for instance, propane is converted into a mixture of mainly ethane and butane [42]. This reaction involves metallacarbene and alkene intermediates and the key CC bond formation/cleavage step is in fact a π-bond metathesis [4346]."

[2] "Cross-metathesis of methane and higher alkanes [48]: this reaction has been discovered using [TaH] and probably involves the reverse step of alkane metathesis."

[3] "Non-oxidative coupling of methane [49]: this reaction is highly endothermic, leading to low conversions, and involves the CH activation of methane on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. Formation of intermediates: The reaction proceeds through metallacarbene and alkene intermediates. These are formed via C-H bond activation of the alkane by the Ta-H species.

2. C-C bond formation/cleavage: The crucial step in alkane metathesis is π-bond metathesis, where C-C bonds are broken and formed.

3. Two-site vs one-site mechanisms: While not explicitly stated, the mechanism likely involves both one-site and two-site pathways. The one-site pathway would involve a single Ta center performing all steps, while the two-site pathway would involve cooperation between two Ta centers.

4. Linear vs cyclic alkanes: The mechanism can accommodate both linear and cyclic alkanes, as evidenced by the transformation of propane into ethane and butane.

5. Selectivity: The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the formation of specific metallacarbene intermediates and the relative rates of different metathesis steps.

6. Catalyst performance: The silica support helps isolate and stabilize the reactive Ta-H species, enabling the reaction to occur at relatively low temperatures (150°C).

7. Related reactions: The mechanism also explains related processes like cross-metathesis of methane with higher alkanes (involving the reverse step of alkane metathesis) and non-oxidative coupling of methane (involving C-H activation on Ta carbene or carbyne intermediates).

The overall process demonstrates the unique ability of supported Ta-H species to activate and transform unactivated alkanes under mild conditions, showcasing the power of surface organometallic chemistry in catalysis.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. 中间体的形成：反应通过金属卡宾和烯烃中间体进行。这些中间体是通过Ta-H物种对烷烃的C-H键活化形成的。

2. C-C键的形成/断裂：烷烃复分解的关键步骤是π键复分解，其中C-C键被打破和形成。

3. 双位点vs单位点机制：虽然没有明确说明，但该机制可能涉及单位点和双位点途径。单位点途径将涉及单个Ta中心执行所有步骤，而双位点途径将涉及两个Ta中心之间的协作。

4. 线性vs环状烷烃：该机制可以适应线性和环状烷烃，这从丙烷转化为乙烷和丁烷的过程中可以看出。

5. 选择性：反应的选择性受特定金属卡宾中间体的形成和不同复分解步骤相对速率的影响。

6. 催化剂性能：二氧化硅支持有助于分离和稳定反应性Ta-H物种，使反应能够在相对较低的温度（150°C）下进行。

7. 相关反应：该机制还解释了相关过程，如甲烷与高级烷烃的交叉复分解（涉及烷烃复分解的逆步骤）和甲烷的非氧化偶联（涉及Ta卡宾或卡拜中间体上的C-H活化）。

整个过程展示了支持的Ta-H物种在温和条件下活化和转化未活化烷烃的独特能力，展示了表面有机金属化学在催化中的强大力量。
