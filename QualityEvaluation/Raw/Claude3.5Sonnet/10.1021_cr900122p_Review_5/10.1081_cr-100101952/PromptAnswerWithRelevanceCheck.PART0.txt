Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text appears to be focused on the conversion of ethane to aromatic hydrocarbons using different catalysts, primarily modified H-ZSM-5 zeolites. It does not discuss tantalum hydride catalysts or alkane metathesis mechanisms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given literature.

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解的信息。这篇文章似乎主要关注的是使用不同催化剂(主要是改性H-ZSM-5沸石)将乙烷转化为芳烃。它没有讨论钽氢化物催化剂或烷烃复分解机理。因此,我无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。
