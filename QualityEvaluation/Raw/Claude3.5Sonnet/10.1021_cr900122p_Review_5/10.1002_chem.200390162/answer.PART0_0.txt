[1] "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

[2] "The formation of smaller cyclic compounds must involve a carboncarbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carboncarbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction,12 while the formation of acyclic alkanes probably arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane (vide infra for mechanistic discussion) followed by the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the open alkane chains."

[3] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

[4] "This speaks in favour of metallacyclobutane/carbene mechanism, which is to be related to that found on metallic surfaces, for which carbene de-insertion was proposed to be a key step in carboncarbon bond cleavage."

[5] "Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis, while it readily reacts with 1 to give a cyclopentyl surface complex as a major surface species. This cyclopentyl derivative evolves upon heating towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative 15, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of cyclic or acyclic alkanes."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations:

1. Activation of C-H bonds: The tantalum hydride catalyst initially activates C-H bonds in alkanes at low temperatures, forming surface alkyl complexes and releasing molecular hydrogen.

2. Linear alkane transformations: For acyclic alkanes, the catalyst can perform H/D exchange, transform alkanes into lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis), and catalyze hydrogenolysis into methane.

3. Cyclic alkane transformations: The process involves carbon-carbon bond activation followed by rearrangement of the carbon skeleton through ring expansion or contraction. Ring opening can also occur, leading to the formation of acyclic alkanes.

4. Key intermediates: Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are likely involved in the mechanism, rather than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition. Carbene de-insertion is proposed as a key step in carbon-carbon bond cleavage.

5. Selectivity and catalyst performance: The reactivity varies depending on the alkane structure. Cyclopentane, for example, does not undergo hydrogenolysis but instead forms a cyclopentyl surface complex that evolves into an inactive cyclopentadienyl derivative upon heating. This deactivation process affects catalyst performance in cyclic alkane conversions.

6. Two-site vs. one-site schemes: While not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, the mechanism appears to primarily involve one-site processes on the supported tantalum hydride catalyst.

The overall mechanism combines various processes including C-H and C-C bond activations, rearrangements, and the formation of key intermediates like metallacyclobutanes and carbenes. The catalyst's performance and selectivity are influenced by the structure of the alkane substrate and the potential formation of inactive species during the reaction.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的几个复杂过程：

1. C-H键的活化：钽氢化物催化剂最初在低温下活化烷烃中的C-H键，形成表面烷基络合物并释放出分子氢。

2. 线性烷烃转化：对于非环烷烃，催化剂可以进行H/D交换，将烷烃转化为更低和更高的同系物（烷烃复分解），并催化生成甲烷的氢解反应。

3. 环状烷烃转化：该过程涉及碳-碳键活化，随后通过环扩张或环缩合重排碳骨架。还可能发生开环反应，导致形成非环烷烃。

4. 关键中间体：金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体可能参与该机理，而不是σ-键复分解或直接氧化加成。卡宾去插入被提出作为碳-碳键裂解的关键步骤。

5. 选择性和催化剂性能：反应活性因烷烃结构而异。例如，环戊烷不发生氢解，而是形成环戊基表面络合物，加热后演变为无活性的环戊二烯基衍生物。这种失活过程影响了环状烷烃转化中的催化剂性能。

6. 双位点与单位点方案：虽然在给定的引用中没有明确讨论，但该机理似乎主要涉及支持的钽氢化物催化剂上的单位点过程。

整体机理结合了各种过程，包括C-H和C-C键活化、重排以及关键中间体如金属环丁烷和卡宾的形成。催化剂的性能和选择性受烷烃底物结构以及反应过程中可能形成的无活性物种的影响。
