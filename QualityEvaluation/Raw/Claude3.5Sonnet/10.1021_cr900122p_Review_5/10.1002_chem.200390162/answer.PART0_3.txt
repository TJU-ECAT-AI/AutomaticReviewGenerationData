[1] "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

[2] "We previously described the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes in the presence of 1 and showed that successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time was preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like a β-alkyl transfer."

[3] "Besides these mechanistic intricacies, the lack of reactivity of cyclopentane towards 1 in the presence of H2 is still puzzling, and its reactivity towards 1 has been investigated in more details in the hope of understanding this difference in reactivity compared to higher cycloalkanes."

[4] "We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes. A key feature is the ring contraction of cycloalkanes under hydrogenolysis conditions, which probably occurs via carbene intermediates (carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane)."

[5] "Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes) and the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on 1 provides an aged catalyst with similar spectroscopic features to that of the model cyclopentadienyl surface complex 14, we propose that the deactivation observed in the hydrogenolysis of all cycloalkanes is most consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations:

1. For linear alkanes:
- CH bond activation occurs at low temperatures, forming surface alkyl complexes.
- Successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time is preferred over two-carbon cleavage processes.
- The catalyst can perform H/D exchange and transform acyclic alkanes into lower and higher homologues.

2. For cyclic alkanes:
- Hydrogenolysis occurs under mild conditions, but with lower activity compared to acyclic alkanes.
- Ring contraction is a key feature, likely occurring via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways.
- The reactivity order is: cycloheptane > methylcyclohexane > cyclohexane > methylcyclopentane > cyclopentane.

3. Key intermediates and their roles:
- Surface alkyl complexes form through CH bond activation.
- Carbene intermediates and metallacyclobutanes are involved in ring contraction processes.
- Cyclopentadienyl species form as inactive derivatives, leading to catalyst deactivation.

4. Factors affecting selectivity and catalyst performance:
- The preference for one-carbon cleavage in linear alkanes influences product distribution.
- Ring size and substitution patterns affect the reactivity of cyclic alkanes.
- The formation of cyclopentane during higher cycloalkane hydrogenolysis leads to catalyst deactivation through the generation of inactive cyclopentadienyl species.

The mechanism demonstrates a complex interplay between one-site and two-site processes, with the formation of various intermediates contributing to the overall reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst in different alkane conversions. The deactivation pathway through cyclopentadienyl formation is a crucial factor limiting the catalyst's performance, especially in cyclic alkane transformations.

由二氧化硅支撑的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的几个复杂过程：

1. 对于线性烷烃：
- CH键活化在低温下发生，形成表面烷基络合物。
- 优先逐个碳原子裂解，而不是两个碳原子的裂解过程。
- 催化剂可以进行H/D交换，并将非环烷烃转化为低级和高级同系物。

2. 对于环状烷烃：
- 在温和条件下进行氢解，但活性比非环烷烃低。
- 环收缩是一个关键特征，可能通过卡宾中间体经由卡宾去插入/金属环丁烷途径发生。
- 反应活性顺序为：环庚烷 > 甲基环己烷 > 环己烷 > 甲基环戊烷 > 环戊烷。

3. 关键中间体及其作用：
- 表面烷基络合物通过CH键活化形成。
- 卡宾中间体和金属环丁烷参与环收缩过程。
- 环戊二烯基物种形成为无活性衍生物，导致催化剂失活。

4. 影响选择性和催化剂性能的因素：
- 线性烷烃中优先单碳裂解影响产物分布。
- 环的大小和取代模式影响环状烷烃的反应活性。
- 高级环烷烃氢解过程中环戊烷的形成导致催化剂失活，这是由于生成了无活性的环戊二烯基物种。

该机理展示了单位点和双位点过程之间的复杂相互作用，各种中间体的形成对催化剂在不同烷烃转化中的整体反应性和选择性产生影响。通过环戊二烯基形成的失活途径是限制催化剂性能的关键因素，特别是在环状烷烃转化中。
