[1] "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

[2] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

[3] "Besides these mechanistic intricacies, the lack of reactivity of cyclopentane towards 1 in the presence of H2 is still puzzling, and its reactivity towards 1 has been investigated in more details in the hope of understanding this difference in reactivity compared to higher cycloalkanes."

[4] "We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes. A key feature is the ring contraction of cycloalkanes under hydrogenolysis conditions, which probably occurs via carbene intermediates (carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane)."

[5] "Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis, while it readily reacts with 1 to give a cyclopentyl surface complex as a major surface species. This cyclopentyl derivative evolves upon heating towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative 15, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of cyclic or acyclic alkanes."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides is complex and involves multiple processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] (1) shows high reactivity towards alkanes, activating C-H bonds at low temperatures to form surface alkyl complexes.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism likely involves metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates rather than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition. This allows for the transformation of acyclic alkanes into both lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis) as well as hydrogenolysis to methane.

Cyclic alkanes undergo hydrogenolysis and ring contraction, albeit with lower activity compared to acyclic alkanes. The ring contraction process is believed to occur via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways. This mechanism explains the formation of smaller cyclic compounds and acyclic alkanes from larger cycloalkanes.

A key factor in catalyst performance and selectivity is the reactivity difference between various cycloalkanes. Larger cycloalkanes (e.g., cycloheptane, cyclohexane) are more reactive, while cyclopentane shows unique behavior. Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis but instead forms a cyclopentyl surface complex that evolves into an inactive cyclopentadienyl derivative upon heating.

This cyclopentadienyl formation is crucial for understanding catalyst deactivation. As cyclopentane is produced during the hydrogenolysis of larger cycloalkanes, it leads to the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl species on the catalyst surface. This self-poisoning effect explains the fast deactivation and low conversion observed in cycloalkane hydrogenolysis compared to acyclic alkanes.

The overall mechanism highlights the importance of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst's ability to form these intermediates, along with its susceptibility to deactivation by cyclopentadienyl formation, greatly influences its performance and selectivity in various alkane conversion reactions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理是复杂的，涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的多个过程。催化剂[(SiO)2TaH] (1)对烷烃表现出高反应性，在低温下活化C-H键形成表面烷基络合物。

对于线性烷烃，机理可能涉及金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体，而不是σ键复分解或直接氧化加成。这允许将非环状烷烃转化为较低和较高的同系物（烷烃复分解）以及加氢裂解成甲烷。

环状烷烃进行加氢裂解和环缩小，尽管与非环状烷烃相比活性较低。环缩小过程被认为是通过卡宾中间体经由卡宾脱插入/金属环丁烷途径发生的。这种机理解释了从较大的环烷烃形成较小的环状化合物和非环状烷烃的过程。

催化剂性能和选择性的一个关键因素是不同环烷烃之间的反应性差异。较大的环烷烃（如环庚烷、环己烷）反应性更强，而环戊烷表现出独特的行为。环戊烷不进行加氢裂解，而是形成一个环戊基表面络合物，在加热时演变成一个无活性的环戊二烯基衍生物。

这种环戊二烯基的形成对于理解催化剂失活至关重要。由于在较大环烷烃的加氢裂解过程中产生环戊烷，它导致催化剂表面形成无活性的环戊二烯基物种。这种自毒化效应解释了环烷烃加氢裂解中观察到的快速失活和低转化率，与非环状烷烃相比。

整体机理突出了卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体在线性和环状烷烃转化中的重要性。催化剂形成这些中间体的能力，以及其易于被环戊二烯基形成而失活的特性，极大地影响了其在各种烷烃转化反应中的性能和选择性。
