[1] "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

[2] "We previously described the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes in the presence of 1 and showed that successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time was preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like a β-alkyl transfer."

[3] "Firstly, activation of a proton in the α, β or γ position in 4 (also called α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction18) generates alkylidene hydride,19 olefin hydride or metallacyclobutane20 (5) intermediates (Scheme 3)."

[4] "The formation of smaller cyclic products can readily be explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes as delineated in Scheme 4 (678, 79 and 810)."

[5] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both one-site and two-site schemes, with various processes contributing to the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism primarily involves CH bond activation at low temperatures, followed by successive cleavage of carbon atoms one at a time. This process is preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like β-alkyl transfer.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism is more complex and likely involves metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates. The process begins with the activation of CH bonds, followed by intramolecular rearrangements. Key steps include α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction, which generate alkylidene hydride, olefin hydride, or metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The formation of smaller cyclic products is explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. This process involves multiple steps, including the formation and transformation of various intermediates.

Alkenes play a crucial role as intermediates in the metathesis process. They can form through dehydrogenation of alkanes or as products of metallacyclobutane rearrangements. Metallacyclobutanes are key intermediates that facilitate carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming processes.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the size and structure of the alkane, the ability to form stable intermediates, and the relative rates of competing processes. For example, cyclic alkanes show different reactivity compared to linear alkanes, with the ring size affecting the ease of transformation.

Overall, the mechanism involves a complex interplay of CH and CC bond activations, intramolecular rearrangements, and the formation of various organometallic intermediates. The unique structure and reactivity of the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst enable these transformations to occur under relatively mild conditions.

由二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及单位点和双位点方案，各种过程都对线性和环状烷烃的转化起作用。

对于线性烷烃，该机理主要涉及在低温下的CH键活化，随后是逐个碳原子的连续裂解。这个过程比两个碳的裂解过程（如β-烷基转移）更受青睐。

在环状烷烃转化中，机理更为复杂，很可能涉及金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体。该过程始于CH键的活化，随后是分子内重排。关键步骤包括α-或β-H转移和γ-H抽提，这些过程生成烷基叉氢化物、烯烃氢化物或金属环丁烷中间体。

较小环状产物的形成可以通过金属环丁烷的重排和氢解的组合来解释。这个过程涉及多个步骤，包括各种中间体的形成和转化。

烯烃在复分解过程中作为中间体起着关键作用。它们可以通过烷烃脱氢或作为金属环丁烷重排的产物形成。金属环丁烷是促进碳-碳键断裂和形成过程的关键中间体。

各种烷烃转化中的选择性和催化剂性能受到诸如烷烃的大小和结构、形成稳定中间体的能力以及竞争过程的相对速率等因素的影响。例如，环状烷烃与线性烷烃相比表现出不同的反应性，环的大小影响转化的难易程度。

总的来说，该机理涉及CH和CC键活化、分子内重排以及各种有机金属中间体形成的复杂相互作用。二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化剂的独特结构和反应性使这些转化能够在相对温和的条件下进行。
