[1] "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

[2] "We previously described the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes in the presence of 1 and showed that successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time was preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like a β-alkyl transfer."

[3] "In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."

[4] "Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkane to 1 (Scheme 2, Pathway 2)13 could also take place and generate the surface intermediate 3. This process can also explain the formation of acyclic alkanes, and the smaller cyclic alkanes would have to be formed via a route similar to that delineated for a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, but in which the steps would involve successive oxidative addition and reductive elimination."

[5] "The CH bond activation of cycloheptane on the surface complex 1 would give 4. In fact this reaction has been shown to take place, and the corresponding cycloalkyl tantalum surface species characterised."

[6] "Firstly, activation of a proton in the α, β or γ position in 4 (also called α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction18) generates alkylidene hydride,19 olefin hydride or metallacyclobutane20 (5) intermediates (Scheme 3)."

[7] "On the other hand, the latter generates a metallacyclobutane 5, which is a key intermediate for carboncarbon cleavage, for example, in olefin metathesis (Scheme 4, Pathway 3)."

[8] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

[9] "Besides these mechanistic intricacies, the lack of reactivity of cyclopentane towards 1 in the presence of H2 is still puzzling, and its reactivity towards 1 has been investigated in more details in the hope of understanding this difference in reactivity compared to higher cycloalkanes."

[10] "Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes) and the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on 1 provides an aged catalyst with similar spectroscopic features to that of the model cyclopentadienyl surface complex 14, we propose that the deactivation observed in the hydrogenolysis of all cycloalkanes is most consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst, [(SiO)2TaH] (1), shows high reactivity towards alkanes through various pathways:

1. CH bond activation: At low temperatures (25-80°C), 1 activates CH bonds to form surface alkyl complexes, releasing H2.

2. Hydrogenolysis: In the presence of H2, 1 catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures.

3. Alkane metathesis: Under mild conditions, 1 transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism involves successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time, rather than a two-carbon cleavage process like β-alkyl transfer.

For cyclic alkanes, several possible pathways are proposed:

1. σ-bond metathesis: This mechanism involves intramolecular CC or CH bond activations, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic alkanes.

2. Oxidative addition: Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkanes to 1 can generate surface intermediates, explaining the formation of both acyclic and cyclic products.

3. CH bond activation followed by intramolecular rearrangements: This pathway involves the formation of cycloalkyl tantalum surface species, which can undergo various intramolecular processes such as α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction.

The formation of key intermediates, such as metallacyclobutanes and carbenes, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These intermediates are particularly important for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and the formation of smaller ring systems.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors:

1. Ring size: The reactivity of cycloalkanes decreases with decreasing ring size, with cyclopentane showing the least reactivity.

2. Formation of cyclopentadienyl species: Cyclopentane, formed during the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, can be transformed into cyclopentadienyl derivatives. These species are inactive in alkane hydrogenolysis and contribute to catalyst deactivation.

3. Temperature: Higher temperatures promote the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl species, affecting catalyst performance.

The comprehensive mechanism involves both one-site and two-site processes, with evidence suggesting that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition for certain steps. The formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions is proposed as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in cycloalkane transformations.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的多个复杂过程。催化剂[(SiO)2TaH] (1)通过多种途径对烷烃表现出高反应性：

1. CH键活化：在低温（25-80°C）下，1活化CH键形成表面烷基配合物，释放H2。

2. 加氢裂解：在H2存在下，1在低温下催化脂肪族烷烃加氢裂解成甲烷。

3. 烷烃复分解：在温和条件下，1将脂肪族烷烃转化为它们的低级和高级同系物。

对于直链烷烃，机理涉及一次一个碳原子的连续裂解，而不是像β-烷基转移那样的两个碳的裂解过程。

对于环烷烃，提出了几种可能的途径：

1. σ-键复分解：这种机制涉及分子内CC或CH键活化，导致形成较小的环烷烃。

2. 氧化加成：环烷烃直接对1进行氧化加成可以生成表面中间体，解释了脂肪族和环状产物的形成。

3. CH键活化后接分子内重排：这条途径涉及环烷基钽表面物种的形成，这些物种可以经历各种分子内过程，如α-或β-H转移和γ-H抽提。

关键中间体的形成，如金属环丁烷和卡宾，在反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体对碳-碳键断裂和较小环系的形成特别重要。

各种烷烃转化中的选择性和催化剂性能受几个因素影响：

1. 环大小：环烷烃的反应性随环大小的减小而降低，环戊烷显示出最低的反应性。

2. 环戊二烯基物种的形成：在高级环烷烃加氢裂解过程中形成的环戊烷可以转化为环戊二烯基衍生物。这些物种在烷烃加氢裂解中是不活跃的，并导致催化剂失活。

3. 温度：较高的温度促进不活跃环戊二烯基物种的形成，影响催化剂性能。

全面的机理涉及单位点和双位点过程，证据表明，对于某些步骤，金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体比σ-键复分解或直接氧化加成更可能发生。在加氢裂解条件下形成不活性环戊二烯基衍生物被提出作为环烷烃转化中催化剂失活的主要原因。
