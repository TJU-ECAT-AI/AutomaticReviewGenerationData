          "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

"We previously described the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes in the presence of 1 and showed that successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time was preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like a β-alkyl transfer."

"In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."

"Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkane to 1 (Scheme 2, Pathway 2)13 could also take place and generate the surface intermediate 3. This process can also explain the formation of acyclic alkanes, and the smaller cyclic alkanes would have to be formed via a route similar to that delineated for a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, but in which the steps would involve successive oxidative addition and reductive elimination."

"Firstly, activation of a proton in the α, β or γ position in 4 (also called α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction18) generates alkylidene hydride,19 olefin hydride or metallacyclobutane20 (5) intermediates (Scheme 3)."

"While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

"We have shown that cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenolysis under mild conditions, albeit with low turnovers; the activities are much lower than those obtained with acyclic alkanes. A key feature is the ring contraction of cycloalkanes under hydrogenolysis conditions, which probably occurs via carbene intermediates (carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane)."

"Since cyclopentane is formed in the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, cyclopentane is transformed into cyclopentadienyl species (which are inactive in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes) and the hydrogenolysis of cycloalkanes on 1 provides an aged catalyst with similar spectroscopic features to that of the model cyclopentadienyl surface complex 14, we propose that the deactivation observed in the hydrogenolysis of all cycloalkanes is most consistent with the formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions."

          The comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] (1) shows high reactivity towards alkanes through various pathways:

1. For linear alkanes:
- CH bond activation occurs at low temperatures (25-80°C), forming surface alkyl complexes.
- Successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time is preferred over two-carbon cleavage processes.
- The catalyst can perform H/D exchange, transform acyclic alkanes into lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis), and catalyze hydrogenolysis into methane.

2. For cyclic alkanes:
- Multiple pathways are proposed, including σ-bond metathesis, direct oxidative addition, and CH bond activation followed by intramolecular rearrangements.
- Hydrogenolysis occurs under mild conditions, but with lower activity compared to acyclic alkanes.
- Ring contraction is a key feature, likely occurring via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways.

3. Key intermediates and their roles:
- Surface alkyl complexes form through CH bond activation.
- Metallacyclobutanes and carbenes are crucial for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation of smaller ring systems.
- Alkylidene hydrides, olefin hydrides, and metallacyclobutanes are generated through α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction.

4. Factors affecting selectivity and catalyst performance:
- Ring size influences the reactivity of cycloalkanes, with larger rings being more reactive.
- Formation of cyclopentadienyl species from cyclopentane leads to catalyst deactivation.
- Temperature affects the formation of inactive species and overall catalyst performance.

The mechanism involves both one-site and two-site processes, with evidence suggesting that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition for certain steps. The formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions is proposed as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in cycloalkane transformations.

          由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的综合机理涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的复杂过程。催化剂[(SiO)2TaH] (1)通过多种途径对烷烃表现出高反应性：

1. 对于线性烷烃：
- CH键活化在低温（25-80°C）下发生，形成表面烷基络合物。
- 优先逐个碳原子裂解，而不是两个碳原子的裂解过程。
- 催化剂可以进行H/D交换，将非环烷烃转化为低级和高级同系物（烷烃复分解），并催化加氢裂解成甲烷。

2. 对于环状烷烃：
- 提出了多种途径，包括σ-键复分解、直接氧化加成以及CH键活化后接分子内重排。
- 在温和条件下进行氢解，但活性比非环烷烃低。
- 环收缩是一个关键特征，可能通过卡宾中间体经由卡宾去插入/金属环丁烷途径发生。

3. 关键中间体及其作用：
- 表面烷基络合物通过CH键活化形成。
- 金属环丁烷和卡宾对碳-碳键断裂和较小环系的形成至关重要。
- 通过α-或β-H转移和γ-H抽提生成烷基叉氢化物、烯烃氢化物和金属环丁烷。

4. 影响选择性和催化剂性能的因素：
- 环的大小影响环烷烃的反应活性，较大的环更具反应性。
- 环戊烷形成环戊二烯基物种导致催化剂失活。
- 温度影响不活性物种的形成和催化剂的整体性能。

该机理涉及单位点和双位点过程，证据表明，对于某些步骤，金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体比σ-键复分解或直接氧化加成更可能发生。在加氢裂解条件下形成不活性环戊二烯基衍生物被提出作为环烷烃转化中催化剂失活的主要原因。
