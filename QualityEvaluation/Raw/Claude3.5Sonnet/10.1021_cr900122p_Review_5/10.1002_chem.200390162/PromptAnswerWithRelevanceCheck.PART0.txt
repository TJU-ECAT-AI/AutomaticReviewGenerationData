[1] "This hydride of unusual structure, for both molecular and surface chemistry, exhibits tremendous reactivity towards alkanes (Scheme 1): a) it readily activates their CH bonds at low temperatures (2580C) to give the corresponding surface alkyl complexes with evolution of molecular hydrogen,4, 5 b) it catalyses H/D exchange in mixtures of deuterated and nondeuterated alkanes including methane,6 c) it transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues under mild conditions (alkane metathesis),7 and d) it catalyses the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures in the presence of H2."

[2] "The formation of smaller cyclic compounds must involve a carboncarbon activation step followed by rearrangement of the carboncarbon bond skeleton by ring expansion or contraction,12 while the formation of acyclic alkanes probably arises from the ring opening of the corresponding cyclic alkane (vide infra for mechanistic discussion) followed by the subsequent hydrogenolysis of the open alkane chains."

[3] "While it is difficult to point to a specific mechanism in this system, it seems that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition, since they both involve transition states with seven-membered rings."

[4] "This speaks in favour of metallacyclobutane/carbene mechanism, which is to be related to that found on metallic surfaces, for which carbene de-insertion was proposed to be a key step in carboncarbon bond cleavage."

[5] "Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis, while it readily reacts with 1 to give a cyclopentyl surface complex as a major surface species. This cyclopentyl derivative evolves upon heating towards the cyclopentadienyl derivative 15, which is inactive in the hydrogenolysis of cyclic or acyclic alkanes."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations:

1. Activation of C-H bonds: The tantalum hydride catalyst initially activates C-H bonds in alkanes at low temperatures, forming surface alkyl complexes and releasing molecular hydrogen.

2. Linear alkane transformations: For acyclic alkanes, the catalyst can perform H/D exchange, transform alkanes into lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis), and catalyze hydrogenolysis into methane.

3. Cyclic alkane transformations: The process involves carbon-carbon bond activation followed by rearrangement of the carbon skeleton through ring expansion or contraction. Ring opening can also occur, leading to the formation of acyclic alkanes.

4. Key intermediates: Metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are likely involved in the mechanism, rather than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition. Carbene de-insertion is proposed as a key step in carbon-carbon bond cleavage.

5. Selectivity and catalyst performance: The reactivity varies depending on the alkane structure. Cyclopentane, for example, does not undergo hydrogenolysis but instead forms a cyclopentyl surface complex that evolves into an inactive cyclopentadienyl derivative upon heating. This deactivation process affects catalyst performance in cyclic alkane conversions.

6. Two-site vs. one-site schemes: While not explicitly discussed in the given quotes, the mechanism appears to primarily involve one-site processes on the supported tantalum hydride catalyst.

The overall mechanism combines various processes including C-H and C-C bond activations, rearrangements, and the formation of key intermediates like metallacyclobutanes and carbenes. The catalyst's performance and selectivity are influenced by the structure of the alkane substrate and the potential formation of inactive species during the reaction.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides is complex and involves multiple processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst [(SiO)2TaH] (1) shows high reactivity towards alkanes, activating C-H bonds at low temperatures to form surface alkyl complexes.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism likely involves metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates rather than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition. This allows for the transformation of acyclic alkanes into both lower and higher homologues (alkane metathesis) as well as hydrogenolysis to methane.

Cyclic alkanes undergo hydrogenolysis and ring contraction, albeit with lower activity compared to acyclic alkanes. The ring contraction process is believed to occur via carbene intermediates through carbene de-insertion/metallacyclobutane pathways. This mechanism explains the formation of smaller cyclic compounds and acyclic alkanes from larger cycloalkanes.

A key factor in catalyst performance and selectivity is the reactivity difference between various cycloalkanes. Larger cycloalkanes (e.g., cycloheptane, cyclohexane) are more reactive, while cyclopentane shows unique behavior. Cyclopentane does not undergo hydrogenolysis but instead forms a cyclopentyl surface complex that evolves into an inactive cyclopentadienyl derivative upon heating.

This cyclopentadienyl formation is crucial for understanding catalyst deactivation. As cyclopentane is produced during the hydrogenolysis of larger cycloalkanes, it leads to the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl species on the catalyst surface. This self-poisoning effect explains the fast deactivation and low conversion observed in cycloalkane hydrogenolysis compared to acyclic alkanes.

The overall mechanism highlights the importance of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates in both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst's ability to form these intermediates, along with its susceptibility to deactivation by cyclopentadienyl formation, greatly influences its performance and selectivity in various alkane conversion reactions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理是复杂的，涉及线性和环状烷烃转化的多个过程。催化剂[(SiO)2TaH] (1)对烷烃表现出高反应性，在低温下活化C-H键形成表面烷基络合物。

对于线性烷烃，机理可能涉及金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体，而不是σ键复分解或直接氧化加成。这允许将非环状烷烃转化为较低和较高的同系物（烷烃复分解）以及加氢裂解成甲烷。

环状烷烃进行加氢裂解和环缩小，尽管与非环状烷烃相比活性较低。环缩小过程被认为是通过卡宾中间体经由卡宾脱插入/金属环丁烷途径发生的。这种机理解释了从较大的环烷烃形成较小的环状化合物和非环状烷烃的过程。

催化剂性能和选择性的一个关键因素是不同环烷烃之间的反应性差异。较大的环烷烃（如环庚烷、环己烷）反应性更强，而环戊烷表现出独特的行为。环戊烷不进行加氢裂解，而是形成一个环戊基表面络合物，在加热时演变成一个无活性的环戊二烯基衍生物。

这种环戊二烯基的形成对于理解催化剂失活至关重要。由于在较大环烷烃的加氢裂解过程中产生环戊烷，它导致催化剂表面形成无活性的环戊二烯基物种。这种自毒化效应解释了环烷烃加氢裂解中观察到的快速失活和低转化率，与非环状烷烃相比。

整体机理突出了卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体在线性和环状烷烃转化中的重要性。催化剂形成这些中间体的能力，以及其易于被环戊二烯基形成而失活的特性，极大地影响了其在各种烷烃转化反应中的性能和选择性。

[3] "In the case of cycloalkanes, more specifically cycloheptane, CC bond activation by a σ-bond metathesis mechanism would lead to the formation of 2, which could then undergo a series of intramolecular CC or CH bond activations by a similar σ-bond metathesis mechanism16 to form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, respectively (Scheme 2, Pathway 1)."

[4] "Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkane to 1 (Scheme 2, Pathway 2)13 could also take place and generate the surface intermediate 3. This process can also explain the formation of acyclic alkanes, and the smaller cyclic alkanes would have to be formed via a route similar to that delineated for a σ-bond metathesis mechanism, but in which the steps would involve successive oxidative addition and reductive elimination."

[5] "The CH bond activation of cycloheptane on the surface complex 1 would give 4. In fact this reaction has been shown to take place, and the corresponding cycloalkyl tantalum surface species characterised."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations. The catalyst, [(SiO)2TaH] (1), shows high reactivity towards alkanes through various pathways:

1. CH bond activation: At low temperatures (25-80°C), 1 activates CH bonds to form surface alkyl complexes, releasing H2.

2. Hydrogenolysis: In the presence of H2, 1 catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of acyclic alkanes into methane at low temperatures.

3. Alkane metathesis: Under mild conditions, 1 transforms acyclic alkanes into their lower and higher homologues.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism involves successive cleavage of one carbon atom at a time, rather than a two-carbon cleavage process like β-alkyl transfer.

For cyclic alkanes, several possible pathways are proposed:

1. σ-bond metathesis: This mechanism involves intramolecular CC or CH bond activations, leading to the formation of smaller cyclic alkanes.

2. Oxidative addition: Direct oxidative addition of cycloalkanes to 1 can generate surface intermediates, explaining the formation of both acyclic and cyclic products.

3. CH bond activation followed by intramolecular rearrangements: This pathway involves the formation of cycloalkyl tantalum surface species, which can undergo various intramolecular processes such as α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction.

The formation of key intermediates, such as metallacyclobutanes and carbenes, plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These intermediates are particularly important for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and the formation of smaller ring systems.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by several factors:

1. Ring size: The reactivity of cycloalkanes decreases with decreasing ring size, with cyclopentane showing the least reactivity.

2. Formation of cyclopentadienyl species: Cyclopentane, formed during the hydrogenolysis of higher cycloalkanes, can be transformed into cyclopentadienyl derivatives. These species are inactive in alkane hydrogenolysis and contribute to catalyst deactivation.

3. Temperature: Higher temperatures promote the formation of inactive cyclopentadienyl species, affecting catalyst performance.

The comprehensive mechanism involves both one-site and two-site processes, with evidence suggesting that metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates are more likely than σ-bond metathesis or direct oxidative addition for certain steps. The formation of cyclopentadienyl derivatives as inactive species under hydrogenolysis conditions is proposed as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in cycloalkane transformations.

2. 加氢裂解：在H2存在下，1在低温下催化脂肪族烷烃加氢裂解成甲烷。

3. 烷烃复分解：在温和条件下，1将脂肪族烷烃转化为它们的低级和高级同系物。

对于直链烷烃，机理涉及一次一个碳原子的连续裂解，而不是像β-烷基转移那样的两个碳的裂解过程。

对于环烷烃，提出了几种可能的途径：

1. σ-键复分解：这种机制涉及分子内CC或CH键活化，导致形成较小的环烷烃。

2. 氧化加成：环烷烃直接对1进行氧化加成可以生成表面中间体，解释了脂肪族和环状产物的形成。

3. CH键活化后接分子内重排：这条途径涉及环烷基钽表面物种的形成，这些物种可以经历各种分子内过程，如α-或β-H转移和γ-H抽提。

关键中间体的形成，如金属环丁烷和卡宾，在反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。这些中间体对碳-碳键断裂和较小环系的形成特别重要。

各种烷烃转化中的选择性和催化剂性能受几个因素影响：

1. 环大小：环烷烃的反应性随环大小的减小而降低，环戊烷显示出最低的反应性。

2. 环戊二烯基物种的形成：在高级环烷烃加氢裂解过程中形成的环戊烷可以转化为环戊二烯基衍生物。这些物种在烷烃加氢裂解中是不活跃的，并导致催化剂失活。

3. 温度：较高的温度促进不活跃环戊二烯基物种的形成，影响催化剂性能。

全面的机理涉及单位点和双位点过程，证据表明，对于某些步骤，金属环丁烷和卡宾中间体比σ-键复分解或直接氧化加成更可能发生。在加氢裂解条件下形成不活性环戊二烯基衍生物被提出作为环烷烃转化中催化剂失活的主要原因。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several complex processes for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations:

1. For linear alkanes:
- CH bond activation occurs at low temperatures, forming surface alkyl complexes.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves both one-site and two-site schemes, with various processes contributing to the transformation of linear and cyclic alkanes.

For linear alkanes, the mechanism primarily involves CH bond activation at low temperatures, followed by successive cleavage of carbon atoms one at a time. This process is preferred over a two-carbon cleavage process like β-alkyl transfer.

In cyclic alkane transformations, the mechanism is more complex and likely involves metallacyclobutane and carbene intermediates. The process begins with the activation of CH bonds, followed by intramolecular rearrangements. Key steps include α- or β-H transfer and γ-H abstraction, which generate alkylidene hydride, olefin hydride, or metallacyclobutane intermediates.

The formation of smaller cyclic products is explained by a combination of rearrangements and hydrogenolysis of metallacyclobutanes. This process involves multiple steps, including the formation and transformation of various intermediates.

Alkenes play a crucial role as intermediates in the metathesis process. They can form through dehydrogenation of alkanes or as products of metallacyclobutane rearrangements. Metallacyclobutanes are key intermediates that facilitate carbon-carbon bond breaking and forming processes.

The selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions are influenced by factors such as the size and structure of the alkane, the ability to form stable intermediates, and the relative rates of competing processes. For example, cyclic alkanes show different reactivity compared to linear alkanes, with the ring size affecting the ease of transformation.

Overall, the mechanism involves a complex interplay of CH and CC bond activations, intramolecular rearrangements, and the formation of various organometallic intermediates. The unique structure and reactivity of the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst enable these transformations to occur under relatively mild conditions.
