The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be about molybdenum-based olefin metathesis catalysts supported on silica, which is a different topic. There is no mention of tantalum hydrides, alkane metathesis, or the specific mechanisms and intermediates asked about in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

所给的文献不包含任何与回答硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理问题相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于硅胶负载的钼基烯烃复分解催化剂，这是一个不同的主题。文中没有提到钽氢化物、烷烃复分解，或问题中询问的具体机理和中间体。因此，无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。
