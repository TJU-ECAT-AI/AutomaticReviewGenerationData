Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text appears to be a partial citation of a different article about titanium alkylidynes, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Without relevant information from the given literature, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive analysis of the mechanism of alkane metathesis as requested.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be about intermolecular CH bond activation reactions promoted by transient titanium alkylidynes. It does not discuss tantalum catalysts, silica supports, or alkane metathesis mechanisms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given information.
