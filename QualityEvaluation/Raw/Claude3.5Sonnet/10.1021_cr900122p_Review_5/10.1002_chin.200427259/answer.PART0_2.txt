The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The abstract provided is too brief and does not discuss the requested topic. The document appears to be about combined metal catalysis and biocatalysis for deracemization processes, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of the mechanism of alkane metathesis or discuss the aspects mentioned in the question based on this literature.

所给文献不包含任何关于硅胶负载钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解的信息。提供的摘要过于简短,没有讨论所要求的主题。该文档似乎是关于联合金属催化和生物催化用于去消旋过程,这与所提问题无关。因此,我无法根据这篇文献分析烷烃复分解的机理或讨论问题中提到的各个方面。
