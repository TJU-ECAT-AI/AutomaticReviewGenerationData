The provided literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The abstract appears to be about combined metal catalysis and biocatalysis for deracemization, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is not enough relevant information in the given text to answer the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis, two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in alkane transformations, formation of intermediates, or factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance.

提供的文献中没有包含任何关于二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解的信息。摘要似乎是关于金属催化和生物催化相结合的外消旋化过程,这与所问的问题无关。给出的文本中没有足够的相关信息来回答有关烷烃复分解机理、双位点和单位点方案、烷烃转化所涉及的过程、中间体的形成或影响反应选择性和催化剂性能的因素等问题。
