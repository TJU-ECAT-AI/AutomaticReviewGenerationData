Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides, discussing both two-site and one-site schemes, the processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, the formation and role of key intermediates (such as alkenes and metallacyclobutanes), and how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be a brief citation or reference to an article about d0-olefin metathesis catalysts, but it does not provide any details about the specific catalytic process mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of the alkane metathesis mechanism, two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation and role of key intermediates, or how these factors contribute to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various alkane conversions based on the given information.

所提供的文献中不包含任何关于二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解机理的信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于d0-烯烃复分解催化剂的文章的简短引用或参考，但它没有提供问题中提到的特定催化过程的任何细节。因此，基于给定的信息，我无法对烷烃复分解机理、双位点和单位点方案、线性和环状烷烃转化过程、关键中间体的形成和作用，以及这些因素如何影响各种烷烃转化中的反应选择性和催化剂性能进行全面分析。

I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be a partial citation or reference to a scientific article, but it does not contain any detailed information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text does not discuss the mechanism, two-site or one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation of key intermediates, or factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance. Without access to the full text of the article or additional relevant information, it is not possible to accurately analyze and discuss the requested aspects of alkane metathesis catalysis.
