If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be focused on attempts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis, but does not discuss the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis that was asked about in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately analyze or discuss the comprehensive mechanism of this reaction, the schemes involved, processes for different types of alkanes, key intermediates, or factors affecting selectivity and performance.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The text primarily discusses attempts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis, focusing on topics such as enzyme mimics, catalytic antibodies, and molecularly imprinted materials. It does not cover the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis or tantalum hydride catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of the comprehensive mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides based on this document.
