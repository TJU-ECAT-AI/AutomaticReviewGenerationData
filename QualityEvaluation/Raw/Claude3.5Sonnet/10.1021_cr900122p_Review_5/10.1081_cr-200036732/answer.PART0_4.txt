The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document primarily discusses attempts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis, focusing on topics such as enzyme mimics, catalytic antibodies, molecular imprinting, and supported metal complexes. There is no mention of tantalum hydrides or alkane metathesis mechanisms. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

所给文献不包含任何关于二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解的信息。该文档主要讨论了试图弥合酶催化、均相催化和多相催化之间差距的尝试,重点关注酶模拟物、催化抗体、分子印迹和负载金属配合物等主题。文中没有提到钽氢化物或烷烃复分解机理。因此,无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。
