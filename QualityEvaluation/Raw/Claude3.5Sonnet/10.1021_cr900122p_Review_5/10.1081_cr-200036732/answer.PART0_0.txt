The given literature does not contain any information about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be focused on attempts to bridge the gap between enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis, but does not discuss the specific mechanism of alkane metathesis that was asked about in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately analyze or discuss the comprehensive mechanism of this reaction, the schemes involved, processes for different types of alkanes, key intermediates, or factors affecting selectivity and performance.

所提供的文献中没有关于二氧化硅负载钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解的任何信息。该文档似乎主要关注弥合酶催化、均相催化和多相催化之间差距的尝试，但没有讨论问题中询问的烷烃复分解的具体机制。由于从提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法准确分析或讨论这个反应的综合机制、涉及的方案、不同类型烷烃的过程、关键中间体或影响选择性和性能的因素。
