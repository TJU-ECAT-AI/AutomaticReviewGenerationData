The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about the mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The abstract appears to be about rhenium-based olefin metathesis catalysts, which is a different topic. There is insufficient information to discuss the two-site and one-site schemes, processes involved in linear and cyclic alkane transformations, formation of key intermediates, or factors contributing to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in alkane conversions as requested in the question.

所提供的文献不包含任何与回答硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理有关的信息。摘要似乎是关于铼基烯烃复分解催化剂的，这是一个不同的主题。没有足够的信息来讨论问题中要求的双位点和单位点机制、线性和环状烷烃转化过程、关键中间体的形成，或影响烷烃转化反应选择性和催化剂性能的因素。
