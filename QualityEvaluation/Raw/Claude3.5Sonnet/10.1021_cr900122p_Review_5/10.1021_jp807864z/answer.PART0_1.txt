<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be about a density functional theory study of propane dehydrogenation over a Ga2O3 surface, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given text.

给出的文献中没有任何与回答硅支撑钽氢化物催化烷烃复分解有关的信息。该文档似乎是关于在Ga2O3表面上丙烷脱氢的密度泛函理论研究,与所问的问题无关。因此,我无法根据给定的文本提供答案。
