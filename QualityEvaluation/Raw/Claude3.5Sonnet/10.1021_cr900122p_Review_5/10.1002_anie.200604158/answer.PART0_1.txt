[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which play a crucial role in the selective production of linear homologues.

The reaction proceeds through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which results in the formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane. This stepwise transfer mechanism effectively prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes, contributing to the selectivity of the process.

The selectivity in alkane metathesis is explained by the carbene-olefin mechanism proposed by Chauvin and Hérisson. This mechanism favors the formation of Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones. Additionally, the formation of branched alkanes is limited due to the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on two-site and one-site schemes or the specific processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations, it does highlight the importance of metallacyclobutane intermediates in determining reaction selectivity. The formation of these intermediates, along with the stepwise carbon transfer process, contributes significantly to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The literature also mentions that linear higher homologues are the major products in tantalum-catalyzed reactions, with butanes and pentanes being the primary higher homologues formed, along with trace amounts of hexanes. This selectivity pattern further underscores the unique properties of the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst in alkane metathesis reactions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及烷烃向其直接低级和高级同系物的转化。这个过程的特点是形成卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，它们在线性同系物的选择性生产中起着关键作用。

反应通过一次转移一个碳原子进行，这导致形成起始烷烃的直接低级和高级线性同系物。这种逐步转移机制有效地防止了长链烷烃的形成，有助于提高过程的选择性。

烷烃复分解中的选择性可以通过Chauvin和Hérisson提出的卡宾-烯烃机理来解释。这种机制有利于形成Cn+1同系物，因为1,3-二取代金属环丁烷的形成比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易。此外，由于gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成非常不利，因此限制了支链烷烃的形成。

虽然文献没有提供关于双位点和单位点方案的详细信息，或环烷烃转化中涉及的具体过程，但它确实强调了金属环丁烷中间体在决定反应选择性方面的重要性。这些中间体的形成，以及逐步的碳转移过程，对催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的整体性能做出了重大贡献。

文献还提到，在钽催化的反应中，线性高级同系物是主要产物，其中丁烷和戊烷是形成的主要高级同系物，还有少量的己烷。这种选择性模式进一步强调了二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂在烷烃复分解反应中的独特性质。
