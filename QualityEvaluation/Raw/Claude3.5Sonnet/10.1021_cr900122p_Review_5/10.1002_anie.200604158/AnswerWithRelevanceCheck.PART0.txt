          [1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

[4] "This selectivity is in contrast with that reported with tantalum hydride or tungsten hydride supported on oxide supports: 1)linear higher homologues are the major products; 2)higher homologues are mainly butanes and pentanes along with trace amounts of hexanes."

          The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which play a crucial role in the selective production of linear homologues.

Key aspects of this mechanism include:

1. Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which are crucial for the stepwise transfer of carbon atoms.

2. Carbon transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, leading to the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane. This stepwise transfer effectively prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes.

3. Carbene-olefin mechanism: The product selectivities in alkane metathesis follow the Chauvin and Hérisson carbene-olefin mechanism. This mechanism explains:
   a) High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.
   b) Low selectivity towards branched alkanes because of the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

4. Product distribution: For tantalum hydride catalysts supported on oxide supports, linear higher homologues are the major products, with butanes and pentanes being the primary higher homologues formed, along with trace amounts of hexanes. However, when supported on silica, there is a contrast in selectivity, with branched higher homologues up to C10 being favored, particularly the isohomologues (except for pentanes).

5. Selectivity: The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, although the literature focuses primarily on linear alkane conversions. The selective nature of this catalytic system contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions by favoring the formation of specific homologues and limiting the production of certain types of alkanes.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on two-site versus one-site schemes, the described mechanism suggests a single-site process involving the tantalum hydride catalyst. The formation of key intermediates, along with the stepwise carbon transfer process, contributes significantly to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

          由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及将烷烃转化为其直接较低和较高的同系物。这个过程的特征是形成卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，它们在线性同系物的选择性生产中起着关键作用。

该机制的关键方面包括：

1. 中间体：反应通过卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体进行，这些中间体对碳原子的逐步转移至关重要。

2. 碳转移：该机制涉及一次转移一个碳原子，导致起始烷烃直接较低和较高线性同系物的选择性形成。这种逐步转移有效地防止了长链烷烃的形成。

3. 卡宾-烯烃机制：烷烃复分解中的产物选择性遵循Chauvin和Hérisson的卡宾-烯烃机制。这种机制解释了：
   a) 由于1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易形成，因此Cn+1同系物具有高选择性。
   b) 由于gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成极不利，因此对支链烷烃的选择性较低。

4. 产物分布：对于在氧化物支持物上负载的钽氢化物催化剂，线性高级同系物是主要产物，其中丁烷和戊烷是形成的主要高级同系物，还有少量的己烷。然而，当负载在二氧化硅上时，选择性存在对比，高达C10的支链高级同系物被优先生成，特别是异构同系物（除了戊烷）。

5. 选择性：该机制允许线性和环状烷烃转化，尽管文献主要关注线性烷烃转化。这个催化系统的选择性特征通过有利于特定同系物的形成并限制某些类型烷烃的生成，有助于其在各种烷烃转化中的性能。

虽然文献没有提供关于双位点与单位点方案的详细信息，但所描述的机制暗示了涉及钽氢化物催化剂的单位点过程。关键中间体的形成，以及逐步的碳转移过程，对催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的整体性能做出了重大贡献。
