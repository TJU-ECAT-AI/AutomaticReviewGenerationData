[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process occurs through a carbene-olefin mechanism, which includes the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

Key aspects of this mechanism include:

1. Transfer of one carbon atom at a time, leading to the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues.

2. Prevention of long-chain alkane formation due to the step-wise carbon transfer.

3. High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.

4. Low selectivity towards branched alkanes, due to the unfavorable formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

The mechanism follows the Chauvin and Hérisson model, which explains the observed product distributions. This process allows for efficient conversion of various alkanes while maintaining specificity in the products formed.

The literature does not provide detailed information on two-site versus one-site schemes or specific processes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations. However, the mechanism described suggests a single-site process involving the tantalum hydride catalyst.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及将烷烃转化为其直接较低和较高的同系物。这个过程通过卡宾-烯烃机制进行，包括卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体的形成。

该机制的关键方面包括：

1. 一次转移一个碳原子，导致直接较低和较高线性同系物的选择性形成。

2. 由于逐步碳转移，防止长链烷烃的形成。

3. 对Cn+1同系物具有高选择性，这归因于1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易形成。

4. 对支链烷烃的选择性低，这是由于不利于形成gem-二取代金属环丁烷。

该机制遵循Chauvin和Hérisson模型，解释了观察到的产物分布。这个过程允许各种烷烃的高效转化，同时保持生成产物的特异性。

文献没有提供关于双位点与单位点方案或线性和环状烷烃转化的具体过程的详细信息。然而，所描述的机制暗示了涉及钽氢化物催化剂的单位点过程。
