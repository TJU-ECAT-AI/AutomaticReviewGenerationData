[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "This selectivity is in contrast with that reported with tantalum hydride or tungsten hydride supported on oxide supports: 1)linear higher homologues are the major products; 2)higher homologues are mainly butanes and pentanes along with trace amounts of hexanes."

[4] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

The alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that results in the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the following key features:

1. Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. These are crucial for the stepwise transfer of carbon atoms.

2. Carbon transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which explains the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane.

3. Product selectivity: The reaction favors the formation of linear higher homologues, with butanes and pentanes being the main products. Only trace amounts of hexanes are typically formed.

4. Carbene-olefin mechanism: The product selectivities in alkane metathesis follow the Chauvin and Hérisson carbene-olefin mechanism. This mechanism explains:
   a) High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.
   b) Low selectivity towards branched alkanes because of the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

5. Prevention of long-chain alkanes: The stepwise transfer of single carbon atoms prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes, limiting the product range.

This mechanism contributes to the catalyst's performance by enabling selective conversion of alkanes to their immediate homologues, with a preference for linear products. The reaction's selectivity and the limited range of products formed are direct consequences of the specific intermediates and processes involved in the tantalum hydride-catalyzed alkane metathesis.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解反应涉及一个复杂的机理，该机理导致烷烃转化为其直接的低级和高级同系物。这个过程具有以下几个关键特征：

1. 中间体：反应通过卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体进行。这些中间体对碳原子的逐步转移至关重要。

2. 碳转移：该机理涉及一次转移一个碳原子，这解释了起始烷烃直接低级和高级线性同系物的选择性形成。

3. 产物选择性：反应倾向于形成线性高级同系物，其中丁烷和戊烷是主要产物。通常只形成微量的己烷。

4. 卡宾-烯烃机理：烷烃复分解中的产物选择性遵循Chauvin和Hérisson的卡宾-烯烃机理。这种机理解释了：
   a) 由于1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易形成，因此Cn+1同系物具有高选择性。
   b) 由于gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成极不利，因此对支链烷烃的选择性较低。

5. 防止长链烷烃形成：单个碳原子的逐步转移防止了长链烷烃的形成，限制了产物范围。

这种机理通过使烷烃选择性地转化为其直接同系物，并且偏好线性产物，从而促进了催化剂的性能。反应的选择性和形成的有限产物范围是钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解反应中特定中间体和过程的直接结果。
