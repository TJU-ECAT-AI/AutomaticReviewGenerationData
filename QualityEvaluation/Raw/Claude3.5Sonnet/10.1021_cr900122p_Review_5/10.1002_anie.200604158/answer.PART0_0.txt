[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which facilitate the selective production of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane.

The reaction proceeds through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which explains why long-chain alkanes are not formed in significant quantities. This mechanism follows the carbene-olefin pathway proposed by Chauvin and Hérisson, which accounts for the observed selectivity patterns.

In terms of product distribution, the reaction shows a high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues. This is attributed to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones. Conversely, there is a low selectivity towards branched alkanes, which is explained by the unfavorable formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, although the literature focuses primarily on linear alkane conversions. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction pathways and product distributions.

The selective nature of this catalytic system contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions. By favoring the formation of specific homologues and limiting the production of branched alkanes, the catalyst demonstrates a high degree of control over the reaction outcomes. This selectivity is a key factor in the efficiency and utility of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis reactions.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss two-site and one-site schemes, the described mechanism suggests a single-site process where the tantalum hydride acts as the active catalytic center. However, further research would be needed to conclusively determine the exact nature of the catalytic sites involved in this reaction.

硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及烷烃向其直接低级和高级同系物的转化。这个过程的特征是形成卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，这些中间体促进了起始烷烃直接低级和高级线性同系物的选择性生成。

反应通过一次转移一个碳原子进行，这解释了为什么不会形成大量的长链烷烃。这种机理遵循Chauvin和Hérisson提出的卡宾-烯烃途径，这解释了观察到的选择性模式。

在产物分布方面，反应对Cn+1同系物表现出高选择性。这归因于1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易形成。相反，对支链烷烃的选择性较低，这是由于gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成不利所致。

该机理允许线性和环状烷烃转化，尽管文献主要关注线性烷烃转化。这个过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在决定反应途径和产物分布方面起着至关重要的作用。

这个催化系统的选择性特征有助于其在各种烷烃转化中的性能。通过有利于特定同系物的形成并限制支链烷烃的生成，催化剂展示了对反应结果的高度控制。这种选择性是硅胶负载钽氢化物在烷烃复分解反应中效率和实用性的关键因素。

虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点和单位点方案，但所描述的机理暗示了一个单位点过程，其中钽氢化物充当活性催化中心。然而，还需要进一步的研究来最终确定这个反应中涉及的确切催化位点性质。
