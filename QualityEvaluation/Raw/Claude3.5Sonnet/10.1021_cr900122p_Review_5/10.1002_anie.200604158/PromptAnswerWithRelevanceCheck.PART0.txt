[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbene–olefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hérisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which facilitate the selective production of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane.

The reaction proceeds through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which explains why long-chain alkanes are not formed in significant quantities. This mechanism follows the carbene-olefin pathway proposed by Chauvin and Hérisson, which accounts for the observed selectivity patterns.

In terms of product distribution, the reaction shows a high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues. This is attributed to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones. Conversely, there is a low selectivity towards branched alkanes, which is explained by the unfavorable formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

The mechanism allows for both linear and cyclic alkane transformations, although the literature focuses primarily on linear alkane conversions. Key intermediates in this process include alkenes and metallacyclobutanes, which play crucial roles in determining the reaction pathways and product distributions.

The selective nature of this catalytic system contributes to its performance in various alkane conversions. By favoring the formation of specific homologues and limiting the production of branched alkanes, the catalyst demonstrates a high degree of control over the reaction outcomes. This selectivity is a key factor in the efficiency and utility of silica-supported tantalum hydrides in alkane metathesis reactions.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss two-site and one-site schemes, the described mechanism suggests a single-site process where the tantalum hydride acts as the active catalytic center. However, further research would be needed to conclusively determine the exact nature of the catalytic sites involved in this reaction.

硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及烷烃向其直接低级和高级同系物的转化。这个过程的特征是形成卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，这些中间体促进了起始烷烃直接低级和高级线性同系物的选择性生成。

反应通过一次转移一个碳原子进行，这解释了为什么不会形成大量的长链烷烃。这种机理遵循Chauvin和Hérisson提出的卡宾-烯烃途径，这解释了观察到的选择性模式。

在产物分布方面，反应对Cn+1同系物表现出高选择性。这归因于1,3-二取代金属环丁烷比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易形成。相反，对支链烷烃的选择性较低，这是由于gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成不利所致。

该机理允许线性和环状烷烃转化，尽管文献主要关注线性烷烃转化。这个过程中的关键中间体包括烯烃和金属环丁烷，它们在决定反应途径和产物分布方面起着至关重要的作用。

这个催化系统的选择性特征有助于其在各种烷烃转化中的性能。通过有利于特定同系物的形成并限制支链烷烃的生成，催化剂展示了对反应结果的高度控制。这种选择性是硅胶负载钽氢化物在烷烃复分解反应中效率和实用性的关键因素。

虽然文献没有明确讨论双位点和单位点方案，但所描述的机理暗示了一个单位点过程，其中钽氢化物充当活性催化中心。然而，还需要进一步的研究来最终确定这个反应中涉及的确切催化位点性质。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which play a crucial role in the selective production of linear homologues.

The reaction proceeds through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which results in the formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane. This stepwise transfer mechanism effectively prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes, contributing to the selectivity of the process.

The selectivity in alkane metathesis is explained by the carbene-olefin mechanism proposed by Chauvin and Hérisson. This mechanism favors the formation of Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones. Additionally, the formation of branched alkanes is limited due to the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

While the literature does not provide detailed information on two-site and one-site schemes or the specific processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations, it does highlight the importance of metallacyclobutane intermediates in determining reaction selectivity. The formation of these intermediates, along with the stepwise carbon transfer process, contributes significantly to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions.

The literature also mentions that linear higher homologues are the major products in tantalum-catalyzed reactions, with butanes and pentanes being the primary higher homologues formed, along with trace amounts of hexanes. This selectivity pattern further underscores the unique properties of the silica-supported tantalum hydride catalyst in alkane metathesis reactions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及烷烃向其直接低级和高级同系物的转化。这个过程的特点是形成卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，它们在线性同系物的选择性生产中起着关键作用。

反应通过一次转移一个碳原子进行，这导致形成起始烷烃的直接低级和高级线性同系物。这种逐步转移机制有效地防止了长链烷烃的形成，有助于提高过程的选择性。

烷烃复分解中的选择性可以通过Chauvin和Hérisson提出的卡宾-烯烃机理来解释。这种机制有利于形成Cn+1同系物，因为1,3-二取代金属环丁烷的形成比1,2-二取代金属环丁烷更容易。此外，由于gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成非常不利，因此限制了支链烷烃的形成。

虽然文献没有提供关于双位点和单位点方案的详细信息，或环烷烃转化中涉及的具体过程，但它确实强调了金属环丁烷中间体在决定反应选择性方面的重要性。这些中间体的形成，以及逐步的碳转移过程，对催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的整体性能做出了重大贡献。

文献还提到，在钽催化的反应中，线性高级同系物是主要产物，其中丁烷和戊烷是形成的主要高级同系物，还有少量的己烷。这种选择性模式进一步强调了二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂在烷烃复分解反应中的独特性质。

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process occurs through a carbene-olefin mechanism, which includes the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates.

Key aspects of this mechanism include:

1. Transfer of one carbon atom at a time, leading to the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues.

2. Prevention of long-chain alkane formation due to the step-wise carbon transfer.

3. High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues, attributed to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.

4. Low selectivity towards branched alkanes, due to the unfavorable formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

The mechanism follows the Chauvin and Hérisson model, which explains the observed product distributions. This process allows for efficient conversion of various alkanes while maintaining specificity in the products formed.

The literature does not provide detailed information on two-site versus one-site schemes or specific processes for linear and cyclic alkane transformations. However, the mechanism described suggests a single-site process involving the tantalum hydride catalyst.

The alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves a complex mechanism that results in the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the following key features:

1. Intermediates: The reaction proceeds through carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates. These are crucial for the stepwise transfer of carbon atoms.

2. Carbon transfer: The mechanism involves the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which explains the selective formation of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane.

3. Product selectivity: The reaction favors the formation of linear higher homologues, with butanes and pentanes being the main products. Only trace amounts of hexanes are typically formed.

4. Carbene-olefin mechanism: The product selectivities in alkane metathesis follow the Chauvin and Hérisson carbene-olefin mechanism. This mechanism explains:
   a) High selectivity for Cn+1 homologues due to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones.
   b) Low selectivity towards branched alkanes because of the highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes.

5. Prevention of long-chain alkanes: The stepwise transfer of single carbon atoms prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes, limiting the product range.

This mechanism contributes to the catalyst's performance by enabling selective conversion of alkanes to their immediate homologues, with a preference for linear products. The reaction's selectivity and the limited range of products formed are direct consequences of the specific intermediates and processes involved in the tantalum hydride-catalyzed alkane metathesis.

However, it can be inferred that the catalyst performance is optimized for linear alkane production, given the high selectivity towards linear homologues and the ability to prevent the formation of long-chain alkanes.

The key intermediates in this process are carbenes, metallacyclobutanes, and likely alkenes, although the latter are not explicitly mentioned in the context of tantalum-catalyzed reactions. These intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and overall catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.
