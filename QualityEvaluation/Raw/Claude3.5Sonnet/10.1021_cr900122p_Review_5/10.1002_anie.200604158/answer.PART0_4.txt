[1] "Silica-supported tantalum hydrides also catalyze the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This reaction, named alkane metathesis, involves carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, and it explains the selective formation of the directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, thereby preventing the formation of long-chain alkanes."

[2] "Notably, the major product was 2-methylpropane (20.7%), and overall branched higher homologues up to C10 are favored, and particularly the isohomologues, except for pentanes"

[3] "This selectivity is in contrast with that reported with tantalum hydride or tungsten hydride supported on oxide supports: 1)linear higher homologues are the major products; 2)higher homologues are mainly butanes and pentanes along with trace amounts of hexanes."

[4] "The product selectivities in alkane metathesis are associated with the formation of the products by the carbeneolefin mechanism of Chauvin and Hrisson, which explains the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues (1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes are formed more readily than 1,2-disubstituted ones) and the low selectivity towards branched alkanes (highly disfavored formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves the conversion of alkanes into their direct lower and higher homologues. This process is characterized by the formation of carbene and metallacyclobutane intermediates, which facilitate the selective production of directly lower and higher linear homologues of the starting alkane.

The reaction proceeds through the transfer of one carbon atom at a time, which prevents the formation of long-chain alkanes. This mechanism follows the carbene-olefin pathway proposed by Chauvin and Hérisson, explaining the high selectivity for Cn+1 homologues and low selectivity towards branched alkanes.

In terms of product distribution, tantalum hydride catalysts primarily yield linear higher homologues, with butanes and pentanes being the main products, along with trace amounts of hexanes. This selectivity is attributed to the preferential formation of 1,3-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes over 1,2-disubstituted ones, while the formation of gem-disubstituted metallacyclobutanes is highly disfavored.

The literature does not provide specific information on two-site and one-site schemes or the processes involved in cyclic alkane transformations. However, it can be inferred that the catalyst performance is optimized for linear alkane production, given the high selectivity towards linear homologues and the ability to prevent the formation of long-chain alkanes.

The key intermediates in this process are carbenes, metallacyclobutanes, and likely alkenes, although the latter are not explicitly mentioned in the context of tantalum-catalyzed reactions. These intermediates play crucial roles in determining the reaction selectivity and overall catalyst performance in various alkane conversions.

硅胶负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及将烷烃转化为其直接的低级和高级同系物。这个过程的特点是形成卡宾和金属环丁烷中间体，这些中间体促进了起始烷烃的直接低级和高级线性同系物的选择性生成。

反应通过一次转移一个碳原子进行，这防止了长链烷烃的形成。这种机理遵循Chauvin和Hérisson提出的卡宾-烯烃途径，解释了对Cn+1同系物的高选择性和对支链烷烃的低选择性。

在产物分布方面，钽氢化物催化剂主要产生线性高级同系物，其中丁烷和戊烷是主要产物，还有少量的己烷。这种选择性归因于1,3-二取代金属环丁烷的优先形成，而1,2-二取代金属环丁烷次之，gem-二取代金属环丁烷的形成则被高度抑制。

文献没有提供关于双位点和单位点方案或环烷烃转化过程的具体信息。然而，可以推断催化剂性能针对线性烷烃生产进行了优化，考虑到对线性同系物的高选择性和防止长链烷烃形成的能力。

这个过程中的关键中间体是卡宾、金属环丁烷，可能还有烯烃，尽管后者在钽催化反应的背景下没有被明确提及。这些中间体在决定反应选择性和各种烷烃转化中的整体催化剂性能方面起着关键作用。
