The given literature does not contain information relevant to answering the question about alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides. The document appears to be primarily about olefin metathesis reactions catalyzed by tungsten compounds, and does not discuss tantalum catalysts or alkane metathesis mechanisms. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the specific question posed based solely on the information in this document.
