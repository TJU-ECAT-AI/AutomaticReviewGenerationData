[1] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

[2] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

[3] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

[4] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

[5] "Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the central process for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. It involves the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in the reaction. Metallacyclobutane intermediates are also formed during the process.

3. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange, which occurs via C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

4. Olefin generation: In a two-site mechanism, one site generates the olefin while the other performs the metathesis reaction.

5. Steric considerations: The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in the metallacyclobutane intermediates or during their formation.

The mechanism contributes to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various ways:

1. Linear vs. branched alkanes: The catalyst shows higher efficiency for linear alkanes. For example, butane is efficiently converted to its homologues, while branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane are not effectively catalyzed.

2. Chain length effects: The catalyst shows different performance for alkanes of different chain lengths. For instance, it effectively converts butane and propane but not ethane.

3. Product distribution: The mechanism leads to the formation of both lower and higher homologues of the starting alkane, with specific selectivities for different products.

This comprehensive mechanism allows for the efficient conversion of certain alkanes, particularly linear ones, into their homologues, demonstrating the versatility and selectivity of the catalyst in alkane metathesis reactions.

硅胶负载钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. π键复分解：这是碳-碳键断裂和形成的核心过程。它涉及烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用。

2. 关键中间体的形成：烷基亚氢是反应中的关键中间体。在过程中还形成了金属环丁烷中间体。

3. 配体交换：通过配体交换形成较低的烷烃同系物，这种交换通过卡宾中间体上的C-H活化和α-H消除发生。

4. 烯烃生成：在双位点机制中，一个位点生成烯烃，而另一个位点执行复分解反应。

5. 空间位阻考虑：反应的选择性受到金属环丁烷中间体中或在其形成过程中空间相互作用最小化的影响。

该机理以多种方式影响反应选择性和催化剂性能：

1. 直链与支链烷烃：催化剂对直链烷烃表现出更高的效率。例如，丁烷能有效转化为其同系物，而支链烷烃如2-甲基丙烷则不能有效催化。

2. 链长效应：催化剂对不同链长的烷烃表现出不同的性能。例如，它能有效转化丁烷和丙烷，但不能转化乙烷。

3. 产物分布：该机理导致起始烷烃的低级和高级同系物的形成，对不同产物具有特定的选择性。

这种综合机理允许某些烷烃，特别是直链烷烃，高效地转化为其同系物，展示了催化剂在烷烃复分解反应中的多功能性和选择性。
