[1] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

[2] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

[3] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

[4] "Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

[5] "Finally, 1a does not catalyze the metathesis of 2-methylpropane, a branched alkane, under the same reaction conditions, despite the presence of a reasonable amount of one of the initiation products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the primary carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation process, involving the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of critical intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are crucial intermediates in the reaction.

3. Two possible mechanisms:
   a) Single-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single catalytic site.
   b) Two-site mechanism: One site generates the olefin, while another performs the metathesis.

4. Metallacyclobutane intermediates: The selectivity of products is influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in these intermediates or during their formation.

5. Linear vs. branched alkanes: The catalyst efficiently converts linear alkanes (e.g., butane) into lower and higher homologues, but struggles with branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylpropane).

6. Ethane conversion: Unlike other alkanes, ethane is not efficiently converted, suggesting limitations in the catalyst's ability to handle very short chain alkanes.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:
- Steric factors in metallacyclobutane formation
- The ability to form and break carbon-carbon bonds through π-bond metathesis
- The structure of the alkane (linear vs. branched)
- The chain length of the alkane

These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis process, with the catalyst showing high activity for linear alkanes but limited effectiveness for very short chain or branched alkanes.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. π键复分解：这是主要的碳-碳键断裂和形成过程，涉及烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用。

2. 关键中间体的形成：烯烃氢化物是反应中的重要中间体。

3. 两种可能的机制：
   a) 单点机制：所有步骤都在单个催化位点上发生。
   b) 双点机制：一个位点产生烯烃，另一个位点进行复分解。

4. 金属环丁烷中间体：产物的选择性受这些中间体中或在其形成过程中立体相互作用最小化的影响。

5. 直链烷烃vs支链烷烃：催化剂能有效地将直链烷烃（如丁烷）转化为低级和高级同系物，但对支链烷烃（如2-甲基丙烷）的效果较差。

6. 乙烷转化：与其他烷烃不同，乙烷不能被有效转化，表明催化剂在处理极短链烷烃方面存在局限性。

反应选择性和催化剂性能受以下因素影响：
- 金属环丁烷形成过程中的立体因素
- 通过π键复分解形成和断裂碳-碳键的能力
- 烷烃的结构（直链vs支链）
- 烷烃的链长

这些因素共同影响烷烃复分解过程的整体效率和选择性，催化剂对直链烷烃表现出高活性，但对极短链或支链烷烃的效果有限。
