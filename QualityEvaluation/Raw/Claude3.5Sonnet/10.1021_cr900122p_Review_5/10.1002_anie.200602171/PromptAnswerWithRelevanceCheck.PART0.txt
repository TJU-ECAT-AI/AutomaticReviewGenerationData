The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the critical step for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. It involves the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are crucial intermediates in the reaction.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The reaction proceeds through metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, with their formation influenced by steric interactions.

4. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

5. Olefin generation and metathesis: The reaction can involve either a single-site mechanism or a two-site mechanism, where one site generates the olefin and another performs the metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by:

1. Steric interactions: The minimization of steric hindrance in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates affects product selectivity.

2. Alkane structure: Linear alkanes like butane are efficiently converted, while branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane are not effectively metathesized.

3. Carbon chain length: Longer-chain alkanes (e.g., butane) are more efficiently converted than shorter ones (e.g., ethane).

These factors contribute to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions, with the reaction showing higher efficiency for linear, longer-chain alkanes.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the central carbon-carbon bond-breaking and -forming step, involving the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in the reaction.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The reaction proceeds through metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, with product selectivity influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in these structures.

4. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange processes, involving C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

5. Olefin generation and metathesis: While primarily described as a single-site mechanism, a two-site mechanism is also possible, where one site generates the olefin and another performs the metathesis.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by:

1. Steric factors: The relative position of substituents in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates affects product formation.

2. Nature of the alkane: Linear alkanes (e.g., propane, butane) are efficiently converted, while branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylpropane) show limited reactivity.

3. Presence of ancillary ligands: The study demonstrates that certain ancillary ligands (e.g., imido groups) can be compatible with alkane metathesis, potentially allowing for further catalyst optimization.

This mechanism explains the observed product distributions and provides a framework for understanding the reactivity and selectivity of silica-supported tantalum hydride catalysts in alkane metathesis reactions.

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis is the primary mechanism for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. This involves the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in the reaction.

3. The mechanism can operate via either a single-site or two-site scheme. In the two-site scheme, one site generates the olefin while the other performs the metathesis.

4. The formation of metalla-cyclobutane intermediates is crucial, with product selectivity influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in these intermediates or during their formation.

5. The reaction shows different efficiencies for various alkanes. Butane is efficiently converted to its lower and higher homologues, while ethane is not. This suggests that the catalyst performs differently depending on the carbon chain length of the alkane.

6. The catalyst does not effectively catalyze the metathesis of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, indicating a limitation in dealing with more sterically hindered substrates.

7. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by these mechanistic factors, particularly the steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates and the ability to form and interact with olefins.

This mechanism explains the observed selectivity in product formation and the varying efficiency of the catalyst with different alkane substrates. The inability to catalyze branched alkanes suggests that the propagation step is hindered, likely due to unfavorable [2+2] cycloaddition between disubstituted carbenes and olefins.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in the reaction. Metallacyclobutane intermediates are also formed during the process.

3. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange, which occurs via C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

4. Olefin generation: In a two-site mechanism, one site generates the olefin while the other performs the metathesis reaction.

5. Steric considerations: The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in the metallacyclobutane intermediates or during their formation.

The mechanism contributes to reaction selectivity and catalyst performance in various ways:

1. Linear vs. branched alkanes: The catalyst shows higher efficiency for linear alkanes. For example, butane is efficiently converted to its homologues, while branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane are not effectively catalyzed.

2. Chain length effects: The catalyst shows different performance for alkanes of different chain lengths. For instance, it effectively converts butane and propane but not ethane.

3. Product distribution: The mechanism leads to the formation of both lower and higher homologues of the starting alkane, with specific selectivities for different products.

This comprehensive mechanism allows for the efficient conversion of certain alkanes, particularly linear ones, into their homologues, demonstrating the versatility and selectivity of the catalyst in alkane metathesis reactions.

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the primary carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation process, involving the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of critical intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are crucial intermediates in the reaction.

3. Two possible mechanisms:
   a) Single-site mechanism: All steps occur on a single catalytic site.
   b) Two-site mechanism: One site generates the olefin, while another performs the metathesis.

4. Metallacyclobutane intermediates: The selectivity of products is influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in these intermediates or during their formation.

5. Linear vs. branched alkanes: The catalyst efficiently converts linear alkanes (e.g., butane) into lower and higher homologues, but struggles with branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylpropane).

6. Ethane conversion: Unlike other alkanes, ethane is not efficiently converted, suggesting limitations in the catalyst's ability to handle very short chain alkanes.

The reaction selectivity and catalyst performance are influenced by:
- Steric factors in metallacyclobutane formation
- The ability to form and break carbon-carbon bonds through π-bond metathesis
- The structure of the alkane (linear vs. branched)
- The chain length of the alkane

These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency and selectivity of the alkane metathesis process, with the catalyst showing high activity for linear alkanes but limited effectiveness for very short chain or branched alkanes.
