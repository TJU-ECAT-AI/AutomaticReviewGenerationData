[1] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

[2] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

[3] "The product selectivity clearly shows that the products are formed by π-bond metathesis as a key carboncarbon bond-breaking and -forming step."

[4] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

[5] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the central carbon-carbon bond-breaking and -forming step, involving the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in the reaction.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The reaction proceeds through metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, with product selectivity influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in these structures.

4. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange processes, involving C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

5. Olefin generation and metathesis: While primarily described as a single-site mechanism, a two-site mechanism is also possible, where one site generates the olefin and another performs the metathesis.

The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by:

1. Steric factors: The relative position of substituents in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates affects product formation.

2. Nature of the alkane: Linear alkanes (e.g., propane, butane) are efficiently converted, while branched alkanes (e.g., 2-methylpropane) show limited reactivity.

3. Presence of ancillary ligands: The study demonstrates that certain ancillary ligands (e.g., imido groups) can be compatible with alkane metathesis, potentially allowing for further catalyst optimization.

This mechanism explains the observed product distributions and provides a framework for understanding the reactivity and selectivity of silica-supported tantalum hydride catalysts in alkane metathesis reactions.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. π键复分解：这是关键的碳-碳键断裂和形成步骤，涉及烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用。

2. 关键中间体的形成：烷基亚氢是反应中的关键中间体。

3. 金属环丁烷的形成：反应通过金属环丁烷中间体进行，产物选择性受这些结构中空间位阻相互作用最小化的影响。

4. 配体交换：较低的烷烃同系物通过配体交换过程形成，涉及卡宾中间体上的C-H活化和α-H消除。

5. 烯烃生成和复分解：虽然主要描述为单位点机制，但双位点机制也是可能的，其中一个位点生成烯烃，另一个位点进行复分解。

催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受以下因素影响：

1. 空间因素：金属环丁烷中间体中取代基的相对位置影响产物形成。

2. 烷烃的性质：直链烷烃（如丙烷、丁烷）能有效转化，而支链烷烃（如2-甲基丙烷）表现出有限的反应活性。

3. 辅助配体的存在：研究表明某些辅助配体（如亚胺基）可以与烷烃复分解兼容，potentially允许进一步优化催化剂。

这种机制解释了观察到的产物分布，并为理解二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化剂在烷烃复分解反应中的反应性和选择性提供了框架。
