[1] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

[2] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

[3] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

[4] "The product selectivity clearly shows that the products are formed by π-bond metathesis as a key carboncarbon bond-breaking and -forming step."

[5] "Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

[6] "Finally, 1a does not catalyze the metathesis of 2-methylpropane, a branched alkane, under the same reaction conditions, despite the presence of a reasonable amount of one of the initiation products."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis is the primary mechanism for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. This involves the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates in the reaction.

3. The mechanism can operate via either a single-site or two-site scheme. In the two-site scheme, one site generates the olefin while the other performs the metathesis.

4. The formation of metalla-cyclobutane intermediates is crucial, with product selectivity influenced by the minimization of steric interactions in these intermediates or during their formation.

5. The reaction shows different efficiencies for various alkanes. Butane is efficiently converted to its lower and higher homologues, while ethane is not. This suggests that the catalyst performs differently depending on the carbon chain length of the alkane.

6. The catalyst does not effectively catalyze the metathesis of branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane, indicating a limitation in dealing with more sterically hindered substrates.

7. The selectivity and performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions are influenced by these mechanistic factors, particularly the steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates and the ability to form and interact with olefins.

This mechanism explains the observed selectivity in product formation and the varying efficiency of the catalyst with different alkane substrates. The inability to catalyze branched alkanes suggests that the propagation step is hindered, likely due to unfavorable [2+2] cycloaddition between disubstituted carbenes and olefins.

由二氧化硅支持的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. π键复分解是碳-碳键断裂和形成的主要机制。这涉及烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用。

2. 烷基亚甲基氢化物是反应中的关键中间体。

3. 该机制可以通过单位点或双位点方案运作。在双位点方案中，一个位点产生烯烃，而另一个位点执行复分解。

4. 金属环丁烷中间体的形成至关重要，产物选择性受这些中间体中或它们形成过程中立体相互作用最小化的影响。

5. 该反应对不同烷烃显示不同的效率。丁烷能有效地转化为其较低和较高的同系物，而乙烷则不能。这表明催化剂对不同碳链长度的烷烃表现不同。

6. 该催化剂不能有效催化支链烷烃（如2-甲基丙烷）的复分解，表明在处理更具立体障碍的底物时存在局限性。

7. 催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的选择性和性能受这些机理因素的影响，特别是金属环丁烷中间体中的立体相互作用以及形成和与烯烃相互作用的能力。

这种机制解释了产物形成中观察到的选择性以及催化剂对不同烷烃底物的不同效率。无法催化支链烷烃表明传播步骤受到阻碍，这可能是由于二取代卡宾和烯烃之间的[2+2]环加成不利所致。
