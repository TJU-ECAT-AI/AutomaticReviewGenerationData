[1] "Based on kinetic and structurereactivity relationship studies, we have shown that π-bond metathesis (interaction of an olefin and a carbene) was the key carboncarbon bond-cleavage and formation process and that alkylidene hydrides are critical intermediates (Scheme 1)."

[2] "Although this mechanism is based on a single-site mechanism, it is also possible to involve two sites, one that generates the olefin and the other that carries out the metathesis."

[3] "The selectivity of initiation products can therefore be understood on the basis of the model developed for olefin metathesis, which is based on the minimization of steric interactions in the metalla-cyclobutane intermediates (or in their formation);"

[4] "Lower alkane homologues are formed using the same elementary steps, that is, by exchanging ligands through CH activation on carbene intermediates and extrusion processes (α-H abstraction)."

[5] "Butane is also converted efficiently into its lower and higher homologues (TON=90 in 120 h) and its cross-metathesis products (Table 1 and Table 2), whereas ethane is not."

The mechanism of alkane metathesis catalyzed by silica-supported tantalum hydrides involves several key processes:

1. π-bond metathesis: This is the critical step for carbon-carbon bond cleavage and formation. It involves the interaction between an olefin and a carbene.

2. Formation of key intermediates: Alkylidene hydrides are crucial intermediates in the reaction.

3. Metallacyclobutane formation: The reaction proceeds through metalla-cyclobutane intermediates, with their formation influenced by steric interactions.

4. Ligand exchange: Lower alkane homologues are formed through ligand exchange via C-H activation on carbene intermediates and α-H abstraction.

5. Olefin generation and metathesis: The reaction can involve either a single-site mechanism or a two-site mechanism, where one site generates the olefin and another performs the metathesis.

The selectivity of the reaction is influenced by:

1. Steric interactions: The minimization of steric hindrance in metalla-cyclobutane intermediates affects product selectivity.

2. Alkane structure: Linear alkanes like butane are efficiently converted, while branched alkanes like 2-methylpropane are not effectively metathesized.

3. Carbon chain length: Longer-chain alkanes (e.g., butane) are more efficiently converted than shorter ones (e.g., ethane).

These factors contribute to the overall performance of the catalyst in various alkane conversions, with the reaction showing higher efficiency for linear, longer-chain alkanes.

由二氧化硅负载的钽氢化物催化的烷烃复分解机理涉及几个关键过程：

1. π键复分解：这是碳-碳键断裂和形成的关键步骤。它涉及烯烃和卡宾之间的相互作用。

2. 关键中间体的形成：烷基叉氢化物是反应中的重要中间体。

3. 金属环丁烷的形成：反应通过金属环丁烷中间体进行，其形成受立体相互作用的影响。

4. 配体交换：通过卡宾中间体上的C-H活化和α-H消除，形成较低的烷烃同系物。

5. 烯烃生成和复分解：反应可以涉及单位点机制或双位点机制，其中一个位点生成烯烃，另一个位点进行复分解。

反应的选择性受以下因素影响：

1. 立体相互作用：金属环丁烷中间体中立体障碍的最小化影响产物选择性。

2. 烷烃结构：线性烷烃（如丁烷）能够有效转化，而支链烷烃（如2-甲基丙烷）则不能有效进行复分解。

3. 碳链长度：长链烷烃（如丁烷）比短链烷烃（如乙烷）更有效地转化。

这些因素共同影响催化剂在各种烷烃转化中的整体性能，反应对线性、长链烷烃表现出更高的效率。
