The HIS promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane to 
butadiene can be efficiently carried out if a molten salt me- 
dium, e.g. LiCI/KCl, is used to dissipate the heat from the 
highly exothermic reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by the 
addition of soluble salts such at TI,O,, BaCl, or MnC1,. Opti- 
mization of reaction conditions by varying temperature, space 
velocity and quantity o
f
 promoter results in a 53% olefin yield 
(5% butenes, 48% butadiene) at 80% butane conversion. The 
system is also shown to be efficient for the dehydrogenation of 
ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene 
and ethylbenzene to styrene. 
xidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons pro-

moted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to 
be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins 
and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated 
feedstocks“J’. The generalized equations for the re- 
actions involved can be written:

Specialized catalysts have been developed for the 
dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene“), ethane to 
ethylene“’ and ethylbenzene to styrene‘”. These cata- 
lysts serve to promote the oxidative reaction and/or 
minimize undesirable side reaction such as cracking 
or uncontrolled burning of the hydrocarbon. In the 
cases of butene or ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation is 
achieved at relatively mild conditions of temperature, 
i.e. 1000-1200°F (640-650°C). This is made possible 
by the alIylic nature of the hydrogen atom to be 
removed caused by the existing double bond in butene 
or the benzene nucleus in ethylbenzene. In the case 
of ethane dehydrogenation, more severe conditions - 
1300°F (705°C) - 
are required due to the absence 
of such activated hydrogen atoms. This high tem- 
perature is allowable only because of the high stability 
of the small ethane molecule. For higher paraffins 
such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking 
and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been 
found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to 
proceed efficiently. Additionally, dehydrogenation of 
butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as 
does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and 
this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking 
of the feed. 
I n an effort to overcome these problems, experi- 
ments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media 
for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation 
of butane. It was thought that the excellent heat 
transfer properties of molten salts would result in 
rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the

formation of hot spots which cause feed and product 
degradation. Furthermore, judicious selection of the 
salts could result in the development of a molten 
catalyst system for the hydrogen sulphide promoted 
dehydrogenation reaction. 
A full review of the use of fused salts as reaction 
media and their use as catalysts for specific reactions 
has been published by S~ndermeyer‘~). 
In this review, 
he cites the high thermal stability, low viscosity and 
wide useful temperature range as desirable properties 
of molten salts for use as reaction media and, as 
mentioned above, their high thermal conductivity for 
dissipation of reaction heat in catalytic reactions. An 
additional advantage for the use of melts as catalytic 
media includes the general immiscibility of decom- 
position products which, while they may cover the 
surface of a solid catalyst, blocking the active sites, 
can be easily removed from a melt. Sundermeyer 
states that catalytic activity is shown particularly by 
salts whose cations can exist in two or more valence 
states, generally salts of the transition metals. None 
of the examples of catalytic reactions in the melts 
quoted in Sundermeyer’s review were relevant to the 
system under study in this paper. 
Melts have been used as reaction media in the 
petroleum ind~stry‘~,~’ 
but chiefly as media for hydro- 
carbon cracking. The latter is an endothermic reaction 
and the melt is used as a heat transfer medium to 
supply heat to the reaction rather than remove heat 
from an exothermic reaction as desired in the present 
system. A variety of melts such as metal halides and 
pure metals“’ and alkali metal carbonates and hy- 
droxides‘” have been utilized in the cracking reactions. 
Oxidative dehydrogenation has been carried out in 
molten salts by Phillips Petroleum Co. on C4 and 
higher paraffins‘’,” but in their work an unpromoted 
system was used and very low yields of olefinic 
products were obtained. Melts used in their studies 
included alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal 
chlorides containing silver chloride.

develop suitable molten systems for the dehydrogena-

tion of butane to butadiene, the optimization of these 
systems and their application to other feedstocks such 
as ethane, propane, butene and ethylbenzene. 
Experimental 
All experiments were carried out in the apparatus 
shown schematically in Figure 1. Reactants and 
diluents were fed from separate containers and meas- 
ured by flowmeters. They were premixed and fed 
through a single inlet tube to the bottom of a stainless 
steel reactor about 1 
inch in diameter and 14 inches 
long containing about 8 inches of melt. The reactor 
was packed in some instances with stainless steel 
mesh or porcelain beads to break up gas bubbles and 
improve contact between reactants and melt. The 
reactor was heated in a 12-inch electric tube furnace 
controlled by a temperature controller. Melt tempera- 
ture was measured by a thermocouple inserted in a 
thermowell positioned in the center of the molten bed 
and connected to a portable pyrometer. The effluent 
gases were cooled in a water condenser and non- 
condensible gases were passed directly to a gas 
chromatograph for analysis. In cases in which the 
products were condensible, the water and hydrocar- 
bon products were separated and a sample of the 
hydrocarbon taken for chromatographic analysis. Den- 
sity and volume of gaseous products were measured 
as was the weight of any liquid product and complete 
weight and material balances were calculated. Typical- 
ly, these balances were 100 +- 2%. 
In place of air as the oxidant for hydrogen sulphide, 
a mixture of oxygen and helium was used. This was 
for analytical convenience as helium was used as the 
carrier gas in the gas chromatographs and if air 
were used as a reactant the large volume of nitrogen 
in the products would tend to hide the fixed gases in 
the chromatographic analyses unless a complicated 
cooling system and dual column analysis was em- 
ployed. 
The composition of a number of mixtures of salts 
which were both molten and stable under the reaction 
conditions was obtained from “International Critical 
Tables”. These included mixtures of alkali and al- 
kaline earth halides and some metal sulphide mixtures 
and are listed in Table 1. In addition, a number of 
metal sulphides and oxides which were reported to 
be soluble in lithium chloride/potassium chloride 
melts‘o,lO,ll’ were investigated for catalytic activity. 
Melt screening for butane dehydrogenation 
The melts listed in Table 1 were screened for ac- 
tivity for the H,S promoted oxidative dehydrogena- 
tion of butane. In each case, 100 g of melt was placed 
in the reactor and heated to 1150°F (621°C). Normal 
butane was passed through at a space velocity of 
0.1 w/w/hr. Hydrogen sulphide and an oxygenlhelium 
mixture (simulated air) were added in the mole 
ratios of nC4/HzS/Oz/He of 1/2/1/3.4. Results are 
shown in Table 2. It may be seen from this table that 
molten chlorides were generally preferable to molten 
sulphides and chlorides containing at least one alkali 
metal chloride gave the best results. Such melts gave 
conversions of the butane feed of 60-100% with 
selectivities to C4 olefins of 24-59% for yields of 
24-40%. The ratio of butadiene to butenes in the 
product varied from 1/1 
to 4/1. Best results - 
yields 
approaching 40% - 
were observed with melts eon- 
taining lithium chloride/potassium chloride and so- 
dium chloride/potassium chloride/cadmium chloride. 
In view of the good results obtained from the mix- 
ture of cadmium chloride with an alkali metal chloride 
mixture, it was decided to investigate other metal 
additives in the lithium chloride/potassium chloride 
mixture for promotional or catalytic activity. A num- 
ber of salts were found to be soluble in LiCl/KCl‘”~lo~ll’ 
These included NiC12, TiOa, CdCI2, TleOs, BaCh and 
MnCL. Table 3 shows the results obtained when 20 wt 
% of each of these compounds was added to the 
LiCl/KCl melt. Experiments were carried out under 
conditions similar to those in Table 2, but at 1200°F 
(649°C). It can be seen that a number of the additives 
showed catalytic effects on the reaction. In particu- 
lar, BaCL and MnCle gave yields of butene and buta- 
diene of 40% or better, with selectivities of about 
50% a t  80% conversions. At the temperature used, the 
butadiene/butene product ratio was in the order of 
two to three. 
Effect of promoter concentrations on yield 
The above experiments were carried out with the 
stoichiometric amount of HzS and O2 for conversion 
of butane to butadiene. Other experiments were 
carried out to determine the effect of increasing the 
amounts of sulphur promoter added to the butane 
feed. The results from these experiments are shown 
in Table 4. These runs were carried out in NaCl/KCl/ 
CdCL melt and used 2, 4, 5 and 6 moles H,S per mole 
of butane with a corresponding increase in the amount 
of oxygen. As would be expected, butane conversion 
increased with the amount of promoter and the ratio 
of butadiene to butene in the product also increased. 
Selectivity to C4 olefins increased to a maximum at 
4 moles H,S/mole Ca and then dropped as H2S was 
increased further. This selectivity drop as H S  and 
O2 were increased was due to (a) increased burning 
with increasing oxygen and (b) increasing reaction 
of products with excess sulphur in the system to 
form sulphur containing by-products (mainly thio- 
phene). The optimum HeS concentration was thus 
4 moles/mole C4, i.e. twice the stoichiometric amount. 
The best melts from the screening program - 
LiCl/KCl alone and promoted with MnCL and BaCL 
- 
were therefore tested at this higher H2S 
level with 
the results shown in Table 5. It may be seen that 
the best results were obtained from the LiCl/KCl + 
MnClz which gave a 65.3% selectivity at 80.9% con- 
version for a 52.9% yield. The products were prin- 
cipally butadiene as the ratio of butadiene to butene 
in the product was better than 10/1.

Application of best system to other feeds 
The LiClIKCl + MnCll system with twice the 
stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for ap- 
plicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely 
ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to 
butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene. Results of 
these experiments are shown in Table 6. It was shown 
that this system was effective in each of these re- 
actions and product yields were as good or better 
than results obtained on using solid catalysts. Thus, 
75% yield of ethylene was obtained compared to 
77% on solid catalyst'z', 82% butadiene was obtained 
from butene as compared to 60% on solid catalyst"' 
and 72% styrene was obtained, compared to 76% on 
solid ~atalyst'~'. 
A brief process variable study on the butadiene 
from butene reaction is reported in Table 7. From 
this table, it may be noted that at constant space 
velocity and HzS/butene ratio, an increase in tem- 
perature from 1200 to 1300°F (649-705°C) caused 
an increase in conversion but a loss in selectivity. At 
a constant temperature a lowering of space velocity 
from 0.08 to 0.04 w/w/hr resulted in an increase in 
conversion and loss in selectivity even when the 
sulphur promoter ratio was dropped from 2 to 1
.
 
Thus, best results of >80% butadiene yields were 
obtained at high space velocity and high sulphur ratio. 
Discussion 
The superior results for hydrogen sulphide pro- 
moted oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in 
molten lithium/potassium chloride eutectics may be 
explained by the observation of Delarue(lo' 
that sulphur 
is soluble in this eutectic and imparts a blue colour 
to the solution. This has been interpreted as due to 
the presence of sulphur in its diatomic formc4) 
which 
has been previously postulated by the authors of this 
paper as being one of the active hydrogen abstracting 
species present in the solid catalyst reaction system"'. 
The stabilization of this active species by the melt 
in high concentration would increase the rate of de- 
hydrogenation. Additionally, the rapid dissipation of 
reaction heat by the melt reduces hydrocarbon de- 
gradation by burning or cracking and leads to the 
improved selectivities to the desired products o b  
served. The reasons for the promotional and catalytic 
activity of added manganese chloride and other soluble 
salts are not understood but it is interesting to note 
that a recent publication by workers at Monsanto"", 
carried out after the present work"", 
in which they 
found that for pure oxidative dehydrogenation of al- 
kanes, a mixture of LiCVKCl + MnClz supported on 
a low surface area alumina was the best catalyst. In 
their case, however, in the absence of hydrogen sul- 
phide only 49% yield of ethylene was obtained from 
ethane compared to the 75% yield shown in our work 
(Table 6) and only 14-18% C
4
 olefins were obtained 
from n-butane compared to the best yield of 52.9% 
shown in Table 5. Furthermore, a Russian patent 
issued in 1972"') essentially duplicated the work pub- 
lished here, again finding that LiC1/ KCl/ MnCh was 
the best melt for hydrogen sulphide promoted oxida- 
tive dehydrogenation of butane. In their work, am- 
monia was added to the feed gases. This has the 
effect of solubilizing the sulphur containing species 
in the reaction products as ammonium sulphide, hy- 
drosulphide and polysulphides, thus simplifying prod- 
uct separation and recycle of promoter. T
