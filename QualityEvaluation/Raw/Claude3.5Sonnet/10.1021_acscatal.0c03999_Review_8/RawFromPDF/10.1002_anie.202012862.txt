Abstract: The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 
hydrocarbons with oxygen (O2-OCM) 
has garnered renewed 
worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of 
enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of 
typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to 
COx products. Other gaseous reagents such as N2O, CO2, and S2 
have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder 
oxidants to replace O2. Although several authoritative review articles 
have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative 
coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X-OCM) have not 
been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze 
OCM research results reporting the implementation of N2O, CO2, S2, 
and other non-O2 oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of 
these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O2-
OCM. Current outlook and potential areas for future study are also 
discussed.   
 
1. Introduction 
Methane is an abundant hydrocarbon and the principal 
component of natural gas. Currently, over 90% of the methane in 
natural gas is flared or combusted for energy generation instead 
of being used as an inexpensive carbon feedstock.[1] The rise of 
shale gas in the past decade has led to a renewed interest in 
upgrading methane 
to value-added 
chemicals. 
Methane 
reforming to syngas, CO and H2, can serve as a source of 
methanol,[1] or followed by the Fischer-Tropsch oligomerization 
process, as a source of  liquid hydrocarbons. These are the most 
widely utilized approaches to methane-derived chemicals  on the 
industrial scale.[2] However, the direct catalytic conversion of 
methane into higher hydrocarbons such as ethylene would be 
highly desirable. Oxidative coupling of methane with O2 (O2-OCM), 
is one such approach in which methane molecules can be 
coupled to form C2 products (equations 1-2).

These OCM reactions are generally thought to involve the 
formation of methyl radicals (CH3·) on the surface of metal oxide 
catalysts.[1, 3] The radicals desorb and couple in the gas phase to 
form ethane, which can be further dehydrogenated to ethylene.[4] 
Unfortunately, in the presence of an oxidant, the ethane and 
ethylene also undergo facile oxidation to CO and CO2, reflecting 
the pronounced thermodynamic stability of these over-oxidation 
products (Table 1). Mechanistically, COx may derive from a 
number of pathways. For example, C2 products such as ethane 
and ethylene may be further activated on the catalyst surface.[5] 
Alternatively, surface or gas phase oxygen species may react with 
methyl radicals.[4, 6] The high temperatures of O2-OCM may also 
facilitate hydrocarbon combustion in the gas phase.[6]    
     Since the discovery of O2-OCM by Keller and Bhasin in 1982,[7] 
there have been over 2000 publications on the topic. As shown in 
Figure 1, there was an initial surge in publications in the decade 
and a half following the original 1982 report. In the past several 
years, the hydrocarbon catalysis community has witnessed a 
second surge in OCM research due to the current shale gas 
revolution. However, despite the abundance of OCM research 
findings, achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and 
ethylene) remains a major challenge. It has been estimated that 
a C2 yield of at least 30% will be necessary for OCM 
commercialization, yet few catalytic systems are able to approach 
this benchmark.[8] The main limiting factor is the formation of the 
aforementioned COx byproducts. Thus, approaches that seek to 
suppress the formation of CO2 and CO from methane or C2 
products will be necessary to achieve high yields of the desired 
products.

The blue bars represent publications utilizing O2 as the oxidant (O2-OCM), while 
the red bars correspond to publications using other oxidants (X-OCM).   
 
       One conceivable strategy to enhance OCM selectivity is to 
control the types of active oxidizing species that are present under 
reaction conditions. The replacement of O2 with other oxidants is 
one possible approach to achieve this goal. In fact, substituting 
O2 with less aggressive, “softer” oxidants such as CO2 or N2O has 
been a frequent strategy for light alkane partial oxidations.[9] As 
shown in Figure 1, a small fraction (about 3%) of OCM 
publications have also pursued this strategy, making use of N2O, 
CO2, S2, and other milder oxidants (X-OCM). Alternative oxidants 
may improve selectivity to desired products by decreasing the 
thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation processes, forming 
more selective active oxygen species, or a combination of these 
factors. Table 1 summarizes the Gibbs free energies of OCM 
coupling and overoxidation reactions for O2, N2O, CO2, and S2 
oxidants. The unique thermodynamic characteristics of these

kinetic considerations relating to oxidant activation may also lead
to mechanistic pathway differences when alternative oxidants are 
employed.   
       Although there have 
been several 
recent reviews 
summarizing the OCM literature, many do not address research 
on alternative oxidants.[1, 10] Those that do often only mention 
them briefly or only discuss one potential oxidant. However, X-
OCM 
systems 
often 
exhibit 
unique, 
under-investigated 
chemistries and promising C2 selectivities compared to traditional 
O2-OCM. As such, this article will, for the first time, review recent 
developments in X-OCM research, focusing on the oxidants N2O, 
CO2, S2, and others. We will compare and contrast the potential 
advantages and limitations of each oxidant, summarize the 
results that have been achieved to date, and critically assess 
current challenges and areas of interest for further study.

2. N2O as an Oxidant (N2O-OCM) 
2.1. Motivation 
N2O is one possible alternative oxidant for OCM and related 
partial oxidation reactions. Like CH4, N2O is a greenhouse gas, 
and its use in the production of value-added chemicals is 
desired.[11] It has been frequently investigated as an oxidant for 
methane partial oxidation to oxygenates such as methanol and 
formaldehyde over zeolite catalysts.[12] As such, N2O can also act 
as the oxidant for OCM (N2O-OCM) to form C2 products via 
equations 3-4. ΔG° of the ethane-forming reaction is -279 kJ/mol 
 
 
2 CH4 + N2O → C2H6 + H2O + N2   
         (3) 
 
2 CH4 + 2 N2O → C2H4 + 2 H2O + 2 N2           (4) 
 
at 800 °C, compared to -114 kJ/mol for the same coupling reaction 
with O2 (Table 1).[13] Note that although N2O-OCM is 
thermodynamically more “downhill” than O2-OCM, the kinetic 
tendency of the catalyst to activate the oxidant is also an 
important parameter that influences reactivity.   
        Utilizing N2O as an oxidant could conceivably lead to 
enhanced C2 selectivity in OCM due to its relatively mild oxidizing 
tendency compared to O2.[14] In particular, N2O can only provide 
a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·.[15] Dioxygen, in 
contrast, can form peroxo species under OCM reaction conditions 
that are precursors to CO2.[16] Furthermore, N2O decomposes on 
the catalyst surface, leading to the release of N2 gas and the 
formation of surface oxygen sites.[15] It has generally been 
observed in the OCM literature that monoatomic surface oxygen 
species (O*) are responsible for selective C2 formation, whereas 
molecular or gas phase oxygen species facilitate overoxidation.[17] 
In fact, it has been estimated that there is an upper limit of 28% 
single pass C2 yield for OCM in the presence of gas phase O2 
under typical O2/CH4 cofeed conditions.[17a] Thus, if N2O 
preferentially forms selective O* sites, with limited to no 
competing diatomic or gas phase oxygen formation, a high C2 
selectivity might be achieved. Additionally, the range of possible 
oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider when using N2O, as there is no 
threat of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion as with O2.[18]   
2.2. N2O-OCM Scope and Mechanism 
The literature reports for each different alternative oxidant for X-
OCM systems tend to highlight very different aspects of the 
catalytic reaction. For example, studies of OCM with N2O as the 
oxidant have focused primarily on comparing N2O-OCM to O2-
OCM systems, activation of the oxidant, and mechanistic insights. 
As such, our discussion in this section will emphasize these 
aspects and end with a brief description of some nontraditional 
N2O-OCM catalysts.  
Catalysts for N2O-OCM are frequently irreducible, basic, or 
rare earth metal oxides. For most of these catalysts, the use of 
N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 
selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant.[18-19] Even at approximately 
equal CH4 conversion levels, the C2 selectivity has been 
observed to be significantly higher using N2O than O2.[19f, 20] For 
example, Hutchings et. al showed that the total C2 selectivity over 
a Sm2O3-based catalyst was 75% with N2O compared to about 
50% using O2 at similar CH4 conversions. More recently, a 2012 
publication from Schomäcker et. al compared the OCM 
performance of a series of literature catalysts and catalysts 
prepared via cellulose templating (CT) using both N2O and O2 as 
oxidants.[20b] The CT synthesis method had previously been 
applied to perovskite O2-OCM catalysts in order to cheaply 
produce bulk materials with high surface area.[21] In the CH4 
conversion range of 25-35%, the C2 selectivity on average is 11% 
higher when using N2O compared to O2. This trend can be 
visualized graphically in Figure 2.  
      The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been 
attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O¯  sites, 
which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals.[18, 20a, 22] A series of 
publications investigated the nature of defects in Li/CaO catalysts 
following both O2-OCM and N2O-OCM.[23] The authors observed 
that N2O-OCM leads to decreased CO production and greater 
yields of C2 products. Electron paramagnetic 
resonance 
spectroscopy (EPR) was used to determine the concentrations of 
various defect centers, such as O3-·, CO2-·, LiCO3-· and O-·. In the 
presence of an O2/CH4 mixture, predominately O3-·, CO2-·, and 
LiCO3-· defects were detected. However, in an N2O/CH4 reaction 
medium, the concentration of O-· increased significantly, providing 
evidence that O-· species are derived from N2O and lead to 
selective C2 formation.[23a, 23b]

using O2 (black) and N2O (red) as oxidants. Data taken from reference 20b.  
 
From the above discussion, the activation of N2O on oxide 
catalysts to release N2 and O* is presumably an important step in 
an N2O-OCM process. The reduction of N2O with CH4 over Fe-
exchanged zeolites may provide additional insight into this 
process.[11a, 24] Such studies have reported the formation of 
adsorbed monatomic oxygen species (O*) after N2O treatment as 
assessed 
via 
techniques such as 
O2-TPD and 
FT-IR 
spectroscopy. Additionally, results from pulse reactions of N2O 
and CH4 suggest that N2O decomposition releases N2 and creates

O* species which then oxidize methane to CO, CO2, or C2 
products.[24d, 25]  
      Several reports using N2O as an oxidant also investigated the 
mechanism of N2O decomposition on the surface of metal oxide 
OCM catalysts.[25-26] Many of these studies attempted to 
differentiate between 
two 
possible 
N2O 
decomposition 
pathways.[26] In Pathway 1 (equations 5-6), N2O is activated at a 
coordination-unsaturated cation to form N2 gas and an O* species. 
A second N2O molecule then interacts with O* to regenerate the 
active center. In Pathway 2, N2O decomposes into N2 and O* over 
anion vacancies, and two O* species may come together to 
release molecular oxygen (equations 7-8).  
 
Pathway 1: 
 
N2O + * → O* + N2  
 
 
 
 
  (5) 
 
N2O + O* → O2 + N2 + *

       O* + O* ↔ O2 + 2 *   
 
   
 
  (8) 
 
  * = anion vacancy 
 
      These pathways can be distinguished by measuring the effect 
of cofed O2 during N2O-OCM. Since Pathway 2 involves a 
reversible O2 adsorption step, the addition of O2 to the reactant 
stream should inhibit N2O decomposition on catalysts that follow 
this route. In contrast, added O2 should have no effect on the 
decomposition rate for catalysts that follow Pathway 1.[26a, 26c] In 
Pathway 1, the active centers for N2O decomposition are 
suggested to be coordinately unsaturated transition metal or 
redox active cations. Oxides such as undoped Bi2O3 or CaO 
catalysts with Fe impurities fall under this category.[26a-c] Contrarily, 
catalysts such as SrO and Li or Er-doped Bi2O3 proceed via 
Pathway 2. Here, the active sites for N2O decomposition are anion 
vacancies, and O2 addition inhibits the decomposition rate by 
competing for the same sites.[26a, 27] In a comparative study of SrO 
(Pathway 2) and Na/CaO (Pathway 1), SrO exhibits significantly 
higher N2O-OCM activity and selectivity.[26a] Thus, it can be 
argued that anion vacancies are the more desirable active sites 
for N2O-OCM compared to redox sites such as under-coordinated 
cations.  
      Kinetic measurements on N2O-OCM reactions have also 
provided insight into the role of N2O. Lunsford measured the KIE 
and reaction rate orders of N2O-OCM over Li/MgO and found that 
the kinetics depend on the N2O concentration.[18] At low 
concentrations, the N2O-OCM reaction is first order in oxidant and 
the measured KIE is near unity, suggesting that oxygen 
incorporation on the catalyst surface due to N2O decomposition is 
rate determining. The CH4 reaction order is zero under these 
conditions, consistent with previous studies by Otsuka that 
claimed the N2O decomposition activation barrier was unchanged 
in the presence of CH4.[22] However, under excess N2O, the KIE 
increases to 1.9 and the reaction becomes first order in CH4, 
suggesting that C-H activation becomes rate-limiting. Kinetic 
analyses over Pb/MgO revealed an N2O order that transitioned 
from 1 to 0 as the oxidant partial pressure was increased, 
although CH4 remained first order across all N2O/CH4 ratios.[19d] 
In traditional O2-OCM, C-H activation is typically the rate-limiting 
step, even at low O2 concentrations.[28] However, N2O 
decomposition is slow on oxide surfaces compared to that of O2, 
plausibly accounting for the mechanistic differences.[19h] 
      Another important factor to consider is how the catalyst 
properties affect the activity of N2O-OCM processes. Branco and 
coworkers studied 
a 
series 
of 
Ca/actinide 
oxide 
and 
Ca/lanthanide oxide catalysts for N2O-OCM in order to determine 
how basicity and reducibility affected the product distribution.[29] 
They found that catalyst basicity, as measured by CO2-TPD and 
probe reactions, correlated with high C2 yields over lanthanide 
and actinide oxides. Furthermore, greater catalyst reducibility and 
more labile lattice oxygen species lead to increased activity but 
lower C2 yields.[29b] These trends are depicted in Figure 3. 
Interestingly, the authors observed that the catalysts are more 
active under N2O than under O2, contrary to most other systems. 
They attributed this result to a cooperative effect between Ca and 
the f block elements.   
       In addition to traditional alkaline and rare earth-based oxides, 
a number of other catalyst systems have proven to be effective 
for N2O-OCM. For example, Sugiyama examined hydroxyapatite 
catalysts for N2O-OCM and observed that the selectivity displays 
little to no dependence on the N2O partial pressure.[30] In contrast, 
O2-OCM selectivity often falls significantly as more O2 is added 
due to overoxidation reactions in the gas phase.[31] It was 
proposed that CH4 is activated by surface O¯ species, which are 
replenished by N2O 
decomposition.[30a] The addition of 
tetrachloromethane (TCM) to the reactant mixture was observed 
to suppress total oxidation in N2O-OCM by replacing surface OH 
groups with Cl.[30b]

maximum H2-TPR temperature) on C2 yield with O2 and N2O for various Ca-

Chlorine is also present in other effective N2O-OCM catalysts, 
such as KCl-LnCl3 molten salts.[20c] The La catalyst displays stable 
75% C2 selectivity at about 10% conversion for 48 hours, while 
the same catalyst only achieves 40% C2 selectivity with O2 at 
isoconversion. After reaction, the presence of oxides and 
oxychlorides was confirmed via XPS and XRD, and catalysts with 
greater concentrations of these oxygen functionalities generally 
display increased activity but decreased C2 yield. Chlorine has

remarkable 30.7% C2 yield (66.8% CH4 conversion, 46% C2

(ethylene/ethane = 2.6), whereas many OCM catalysts produce 
primarily ethane.[5a, 33]

         Many similarities can be drawn between O2 and N2O-OCM 
systems. Research on both oxidants has predominantly focused 
on basic, alkaline earth, or rare earth oxides. Surface basicity and 
oxygen content/lability are important factors affecting reactivity 
and selectivity for both systems.[10b, 29] Furthermore, the role of 
both O2 and N2O in replenishing/forming active oxygen species 
on the surface has been emphasized.[27, 34] However, the nature 
of these active species may differ. While O2 can form peroxo 
species that act as COx precursors, N2O can only initially form 
monoatomic O or O¯ species and does not cause gas phase 
combustion reactions. These oxygen species can be formed via 
N2O decomposition, releasing N2. Figure 4 summarizes the 
mechanistic steps of N2O-OCM that have been proposed by 
various authors.[18, 19d, 22, 32] The higher C2 selectivity with N2O as 
an oxidant in turn has afforded promising yields. In fact, several 
catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater 
than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems.[35] Figure 5 
depicts the conversion and C2 selectivity of the top-performing 
N2O-OCM catalysts. These high C2 yields highlight that N2O-
OCM is an approach that merits further study during this shale 
gas age.

investigated frequently as a softer oxidant for light alkane partial 
oxidation reactions.[36] Its use as an oxygen source for light alkane 
activation is currently especially attractive due to the high content 
of CO2 that is found in some shale gas reservoirs. For example, 
the New Albany Shale in Illinois and Kentucky contains up to 10% 
CO2.[37]  For OCM with CO2 as an oxidant (CO2-OCM), ethane and 
ethylene may be produced according to equations 9-10.  ΔG° of  
 
  
   2 CH4 + CO2 → C2H6 + H2O + CO

      (10) 
 
the reaction in equation 10 (ethylene) is +71 kJ/mol at 800 °C, 
compared to -307 kJ/mol with O2 (Table 1).[38] The endergonic 
nature of CO2-OCM, coupled with the inherent stability of the CO2 
molecule implies that CO2-OCM is a more challenging reaction to 
drive forward then the O2 variant. However, employing CO2 as the 
oxidant alleviates heat management issues that challenge the 
highly exothermic O2-OCM. Furthermore, ethylene forms via 
thermal dehydrogenation of ethane in the gas phase in many 
OCM systems according to equation 11.[34, 39]  
 
         C2H6 → C2H4 + H2  
                               (11) 
 
The addition of CO2 could help shift the equilibrium of this process 
towards the more valuable ethylene by consuming H2 via the 
reverse water-gas shift reaction (equation 12). 
 
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O  
 
 
    (12) 
  
Likewise, other side reactions between CH4 and CO2 to form CO 
(equations 13-14) such as dry reforming may occur, although they 
are less common over metal oxide catalysts compared to 
supported metallic catalysts. However, unlike O2-OCM where  
 
CH4 + CO2 → 2 CO + 2 H2   
    
    (13) 
 
        CH4 + 3 CO2 → 4 CO + 2 H2O  
             (14) 
 
both CO and CO2 are formed, CO will be the only carbon-
containing byproduct when CO2 is the oxidant. 
      Furthermore, CO2-OCM can plausibly improve the C2 
selectivity owing to the nature of active oxygen species. Like N2O, 
CO2 can only deliver monoatomic oxygen species to activate CH4 
on the catalyst surface, preventing the formation of surface 
peroxo and gas phase oxygen that lead to overoxidation. 
Moreover, unlike O2, CO2 is unlikely to interact with ·CH3 radicals 
in the gas phase.[40] Thermodynamic analyses place equilibrium 
CH4 conversions in the range of 10-30% in the temperature range

3.2. CO2-OCM Scope and Mechanism 
Unlike the literature on N2O-OCM, which focuses heavily on 
oxidant activation, prior discussions of CO2-OCM tended to 
concentrate more on the development of active/selective 
catalysts and alternate reactor designs. This section will therefore 
examine the advancement of CO2-OCM catalyst discovery, 
followed by a discussion of unconventional CO2-OCM reactor 
concepts.  
Because CO2 is often a major (although undesired) product 
of O2-OCM, several studies have cofed CO2 along with CH4 and 
O2 in order to determine the effect on reactivity. For example, CO2 
was found to decrease OCM activity over Li/MgO due to the 
formation of carbonate species, but also to improve C2 selectivity 
and stabilize the catalyst against deactivation.[42] In the early 
1990’s, researchers began to introduce significant concentrations 
of CO2 as co-oxidants/reactive diluents in an attempt to manage 
heat production and make use of the oxygen in CO2.[38, 43] Aika 
and Nishiyama found that the addition of CO2 increases the C2 
yield over PbO-based catalysts, although the reaction cannot be 
sustained without oxygen.[38] They also performed the reaction 
using isotopically-labelled 13CO2 and 12CD4 with O2 and found that 
only 13CO and 12C2 hydrocarbons are produced.[43a] Therefore, C2 
hydrocarbons form exclusively from methane, whereas CO is 
derived from CO2, suggesting that CO2 acts as an oxidant. A 
further study of Pb catalysts compared the reaction of CH3I (a 
methyl radical precursor) under OCM conditions.[43c] With O2 as 
an oxidant, only CO2 is formed. However, when CO2 is added, C2 
products are observed, implying that CO2 inhibits the over-
oxidation of methyl radicals. Suzuki also observed increased C2 
selectivity and yield in the presence of CO2 over various basic 
oxides, although oxide catalysts that form highly stable 
carbonates such as SrO deactivated rapidly.[43b] 
      In the first example of CO2-OCM without added O2, Asami 
investigated 17 monometallic metal oxides for the reaction and 
found that rare earth oxides were most selective to C2’s.[40] A 
follow-up study compared the CO2-OCM reactivity of lanthanide 
oxides.[44] Pr and Tb oxides, in particular, afforded high C2 yields. 
The authors suggested a mechanism in which CO2 first oxidizes 
the catalyst surface, and these surface oxygen species activate 
the C-H bond in CH4 to form methyl radicals. This mechanism was 
later supported by O2-TPD experiments on the redox-active Pr2O3 
catalyst.[45] The nature of the active oxygen species was also 
studied using the well-known Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 O2-OCM 
catalyst.[46] Here O2-TPD and CH4 pulse experiments suggested 
that surface lattice oxygen is involved in methane activation. 
Furthermore, CO2 pulse experiments showed that CO is formed 
over the catalyst in the absence of CH4.  This result suggests that 
CO2 is activated to CO and O*, consistent with CO2 producing 
oxygen species that can activate methane. 
       Several CO2-OCM studies have also examined binary 
oxides.[41, 47] The first of these systems utilized a La2O3/ZnO 
catalyst.[47a] The addition of La to ZnO led to a dramatic increase 
from 7.6% to above 90% C2 selectivity, even at comparable 
conversions. The authors postulated a mechanism in which CO2 
dissociation leads to active O* formation according to equations  
15-17, where * represents an oxygen-deficient site. This 
mechanism bears strong resemblance to that of N2O- and O2-
OCM, with the major difference being that CO2 provides the active 
O* in this case.

       Later, a series of binary oxide systems was developed, 
consisting of basic oxide and redox-active oxide components. The 
idea here is that the basic component facilitates CO2 
chemisorption 
whereas 
the 
redox 
component 
enables 
dissociation into CO and O*. CaO-Cr2O3,[47b] CaO-CeO2,[41, 47c] 
CaO-ZnO,[47d] and Sr-Mn[47e, 47f] have all proven effective for CO2-
OCM. 
Ternary 
Ca-Mn/CeO2 
catalysts 
have 
also 
been 
explored.[47g-j] When tested alone under CO2-OCM conditions, the 
redox-active oxide is typically highly active but poorly selective. 
Contrarily, the basic oxide displays negligible activity when used 
alone, presumably because it is unable to dissociate CO2 and 
form active O*. However, the binary and ternary oxides display a 
cooperative effect in which high C2 selectivity is sustained at 
reasonable conversions.[41, 47b] Figure 7 depicts the proposed 
mechanism for CO2-OCM over binary/ternary oxides such as 
CaO-CeO2. This mechanism has been supported by CO2-TPD 
and H2-TPR experiments. Istadi[47g] and Wang[41] both showed 
that incorporating CaO into CeO2 leads to the formation of basic 
sites, while CeO2 alone displays little to no CO2 sorption. TPR also 
revealed that catalysts with greater reducibility are more active for 
CO2-OCM.[47g, 47h]

      Some research groups have also attempted to modify the 
synthetic method or morphology of CO2-OCM catalysts in order 
to achieve enhanced performance. One group prepared CeO2-
ZnO nanocatalysts 
using a synthetic method combining 
homogeneous precipitation and micro-emulsions.[48] Although the 
C2 selectivities were about the same, the nanocatalyst displayed 
significantly higher conversion and a 100 °C lower light-off 
temperature than the traditionally prepared counterpart. An 
optimum C2 yield of 4.8% was obtained. These researchers also 
found that the methane conversion rises with increasing fractal 
dimensions of the catalyst. Since fractal dimension is an indicator 
of surface defect density, this result suggests that more defects 
lead to greater active site density. Recent work by Zhang and 
coworkers also applied the polymerized complex (PC) synthesis 
method to Na-Cl/CaO catalysts for CO2-OCM.[49] The catalyst 
synthesized by the PC method performed better than the same 
composition prepared by impregnation, with a maximum C2 yield 
of 6.6% at 950 °C.  
      To increase conversion and decrease reaction temperature, 
various non-traditional catalytic systems have also been 
proposed for CO2-OCM. For example, Larkin and coworkers 
applied a plasma reactor system to achieve low temperature CO2-
OCM in the absence of a catalyst.[50] Although, CH4 conversions 
in excess of 20% were achieved, almost all the products were 
oxygenates such as formaldehyde. Another group achieved over 
22% C2 selectivity at a high 70.8% CH4 conversion without a 
catalyst in a plasma reactor.[51] However, the reforming reaction 
still dominates, and the majority of the C2 products are acetylene. 
Likewise, a catalytic system using a plasma reactor delivered 
18.1% C2 yield over La/Al2O3, but about 65% of the C2 products 
were acetylene.[52]  
      CO2-OCM reactor systems that use electric fields have also 
been studied. Oshima and coworkers examined Zr- and La-based 
catalysts for CO2-OCM in the presence of an electric field.[53] The 
CH4 conversion in the electric field at 423 K was significantly 
higher than in a conventional reactor at 1173 K. Nevertheless, the 
reaction heavily favored dry reforming to CO over the CH4 
coupling reaction. Another publication studied Ca-doped LaAlO3 
perovskites as CO2-OCM catalysts in an electric field.[54] CH4 
conversions greater than 10% were achieved at low furnace 
temperatures of 348 K. The authors reported a maximum C2 yield 
of 7.4%, the highest yield with CO2 as an oxidant to date. However, 
the conversion, C2 selectivity, and product breakdowns were 
unfortunately not provided under these conditions. A reaction rate 
order of 0.7 was also measured for CO2, signifying that CO2 may 
be involved in the rate determining step.  
      Recently, photochemistry has also been explored as an 
unconventional method for CO2-OCM catalysis. Although several 
publications have reported photocatalytic reactions between CH4 
and CO, most are focused on reforming and do not produce any 
C2 products.[55] However, Li and coworkers reported significant 
ethylene yields over a 1 wt% Ag/TiO2 catalyst at room 
temperature using a plasma-assisted photocatalytic system.[56] 
For example, under optimized conditions, the authors observed 
an ethylene yield rate of about 7 μmol/g/h×102, compared to 12 
μmol/g/h ×102 for CO. TPD experiments suggested that CO2 
adsorbs on TiO2 while CH4 adsorbs on the Ag sites. Additionally, 
isotope experiments using 13CO2 showed that the produced CO 
derived from CO2, while ethylene formed due to CH4 coupling.  
       In summary, much like in O2- or N2O-OCM, oxygen species 
on the surface of the catalyst activate CH4 to form methyl radicals 
when CO2 is used as the oxidant. The CO2 molecule provides one 
oxygen to form these sites via decomposition. Catalyst discovery 
has therefore focused on materials that are efficient at CO2 
adsorption and decomposition. Binary oxides with basic and 
redox components have been found to be most effective. In 
general, the addition of CO2 in OCM has been shown to increase 
C2 yield, which may reflect the formation of monatomic O* and/or 
reduced reaction exothermicity. However, far fewer comparative 
studies of O2-OCM vis-a-vis CO2-OCM have been performed than 
for N2O-OCM, currently making a direct comparison between 
these oxidants difficult. The thermodynamic constraints on CO2-
OCM and competing dry reforming reaction have thus far limited 
the C2 yield to mostly below 10% (see Table 2 for a summary of 
some of the best performing CO2-OCM systems). Nevertheless, 
research into CO2-OCM catalyst systems that are able to increase 
CH4 conversion without sacrificing selectivity may provide 
valuable insight into how to effectively utilize these two 
greenhouse gases.   
4. S2 as an Oxidant (S2-OCM) 
4.1. Motivation 
 
The elemental sulfur dimer (disulfur, S2) was first investigated by 
Marks and Neurock as a soft oxidant for the OCM reaction in 
2013.[57] S2 is the primary sulfur allotrope above 700 °C and is 
isoelectronic with the O2 molecule.[58] As such, an S2-OCM 
process (SOCM; Table 1) could presumably proceed analogously 
to the O2 system according to equations 18-20, with total oxidation 
to CS2 occurring via equation 20.

Importantly, when O2 is replaced with S2, methane coupling 
remains thermodynamically feasible at 800 °C, and becomes 
more favorable at higher temperatures.[57] The feasibility of the 
reaction is also supported by studies of the partial oxidation of 
CH4/H2S mixtures with O2 to produce ethylene, since H2S and O2 
may 
react to produce S2 at elevated temperatures.[59]  
Furthermore, as evident in Figure 8, the thermodynamic driving 
force for total oxidation is significantly reduced with S2, suggesting 
that SOCM might afford higher ethylene selectivity.

methane coupling to ethylene and total oxidation for S2 (blue) and O2 (red) at

The reduced exothermicity may also alleviate heat management 
issues and local temperature hotspots that arise during the highly 
exothermic O2-OCM process. Additionally, elemental sulfur is an 
abundant resource that is routinely processed at most plants that 
deal with hydrocarbons. For example, the H2S byproduct of 
SOCM could be recycled back to elemental sulfur via the efficient, 
industrialized Claus process according to Equations 21-22.[60]

4.2. SOCM Scope and Mechanism 
 
 
Compared to N2O- and CO2-OCM, SOCM is relatively new, with 
the first report of the catalytic reaction appearing in 2013. The 
earliest two studies focused on catalyst discovery of the new 
reaction, with a more recent publication studying the mechanism 
in greater depth via both experiment and theory. This section will 
examine each of these literature reports chronologically.  
In the original study of SOCM, four metal sulfide materials 
(PdS, MoS2, TiS2, RuS2) displayed activity for the SOCM 
reaction.[57] Ethylene selectivities of up to 18% were achieved at 
a conversion of 15% over PdS, although the reaction temperature 
was quite high (1050 °C). Both conversion and selectivity could 
be improved by dispersing PdS onto a ZrO2 support. DFT 
techniques were used to calculate the M-S bond energies of the 
various sulfide catalysts. A positive correlation was observed 
between methane C-H bond cleavage activation energy and the 
M-S bond strength, while the activation energy of :CH2 methylene 
coupling to ethylene followed an opposite trend.  
A follow-up study examined simple metal oxides as catalyst 
precursors for SOCM.[61] Since the oxides transform into the 
corresponding metal sulfides following pretreatment in an H2S/S2 
mixture, the resulting metal sulfide was considered to be the 
active phase. Sulfided Fe3O4 achieves stable ethylene selectivity 
of about 30% at 950 °C and 5% conversion, a significant gain over 
the previous SOCM study at the same temperature (<10% 
ethylene over PdS at 950 °C). The addition of Pd to the Fe catalyst 
did not improve conversion or selectivity, signifying that precious 
metals are not required for high ethylene yields. Additionally, 
ethylene/ethane product ratios are notably higher than those 
reported for typical O2-OCM.[5a, 33]   
Marks and Neurock more recently conducted a detailed 
mechanistic investigation of SOCM over sulfided Fe3O4 using 
combined theory and experiment.[62] Some key mechanistic 
differences are observed between the SOCM and OCM catalytic 
systems. For example, SOCM is found to be first order in both 
CH4 and S2, whereas O2-OCM is first order in CH4 and ½ order in 
the oxidant over many catalysts, reflecting an O2 dissociation 
step.[5a, 63]  DFT calculations on an FeS2 surface corroborate the 
experimental results, and a complex reaction network (Figure 9) 
was proposed. Briefly, ethylene is suggested to form mainly over 
Fe-S surface sites via coupling of :CH2 species (Figure 9, left). 
Dehydrogenation of ethane is also possible, although it is not the 
primary pathway (Figure 9, right). In contrast, adsorbed sulfur 
dimer (Sdim) sites catalyze the total oxidation of CH4 → CS2 (Figure 
9, center). Direct conversion of C2 products to CS2 is relatively 
minimal. These results stand in contrast to traditional OCM, where 
COx often arises from overoxidation of ethylene.[5]

865 °C. The numbers in brackets are the intrinsic activation barriers (kJ/mol) 
for C-H activation in methane over the respective surface sites. Modified from 
reference 61. 
 
        To date, the C2 yields obtained via SOCM remain below 
industrially attractive metrics. However, considering that only 
three investigations have been published on this reaction, there is 
an enormous opportunity for future catalyst design and process 
engineering to improve upon the current numbers. Under-
standably, the SOCM mechanism over metal sulfides differs

significantly from the OCM mechanism when O2, N2O, or CO2 is 
the oxidant. Nevertheless, the unselective sulfur dimer sites that 
form CS2 are reminiscent of peroxo species that are precursors to 
COx in O2-OCM. The fact that monatomic sulfur species in Fe-S 
sites are selective for C2 formation likewise mirrors the selectivity 
of O* sites in N2O- and CO2-OCM. These intriguing similarities 
highlight that far higher C2 selectivities may be achievable in 
SOCM if the influence of the unselective sulfur dimer sites can be 
suppressed/modified. Additionally, the efficacy of S2 as an oxidant 
has recently been expanded to the selective oxidative 
dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.[64] Future studies of 
these 
reactions 
may 
provide 
additional 
mechanistic 
understanding of SOCM. 
5. Other Oxidants 
While the oxidants that have been discussed in the previous 
sections represent the majority of publications in the field of 
alternative oxidants for OCM, it is conceivable that an oxidizing 
species could also be derived from a number of other gaseous 
species, such as NO, NO2, SO2, SO3, O3, or H2O. A handful of 
studies in the 1980’s and 1990’s examined these potential 
oxidants. An early study by Asami and coworkers compared O2, 
N2O, and NO for gas-phase OCM in the absence of catalyst.[65]  
The C2 yield and selectivity were greater when using N2O 
compared to O2 under all the conditions tested. However, very 
little CH4 conversion was observed when NO was employed, and 
carbon oxides were the primary products. The authors attributed 
these results to the known radical quenching nature of NO,[66] 
since the formation and coupling of methyl radicals is considered 
to be the route of C2 formation.  
      The same group later studied OCM over a PbO/MgO catalyst  
using a variety of different oxidants.[13] Consistent with many of 
the reports discussed in Section 2, N2O exhibited the best 
performance, with greater C2 selectivity than O2 at approximately 
equal CH4 conversions. CO2 as an oxidant also produced C2 
hydrocarbons, although the reaction rate was considerably slower. 
In contrast, NO and SO2 formed CO2 almost exclusively. 
Additionally, the PbO catalyst was sulfided to PbS under reaction 
conditions when SO2 was employed, which led to catalyst 
deactivation with time on stream. Shepelev and coworkers also 
studied the effect of oxidant identity for OCM over zeolite 
catalysts.[67] Like the aforementioned Asami studies, N2O-OCM 
displays promising activity and C2 selectivity, while NO, NO2, and 
SO3 yield CO2 as the only carbon-containing product.  
       Ozone (O3) may potentially also act as an OCM oxidant. In 
particular, O3 can activate methane at  considerably lower 
temperatures (<400 °C) than O2 due to the capacity of O3 to form 
radicals at these low temperatures.[68] Indeed, when O3 was 
utilized as an oxidant for OCM over Li/MgO catalysts, methane 
conversion was observed at temperatures as low as 215 °C, 
whereas the same catalyst was inactive in methane  conversion 
with O2 until at least 400 °C.[19c, 69] Although O3 is a significantly 
more reactive oxidant than O2 in the low temperature regime, the 
difference in activity becomes insignificant at higher temperatures. 
This effect likely reflects the fact that O3 is unstable and 
decomposes to O2 at elevated temperatures.[70] Furthermore, CO2 
and CO were the only carbon-containing products at low 
temperatures; C2 products were not observed until the 
temperature reached 700 °C. 
      There has additionally been at least one publication using H2O 
as an oxidant for OCM.[71] Unlike other systems, this oxidant is 
expected to produce H2 as the main byproduct over metal oxide 
catalysts, according to equations 23-24, where M is a metal site 
on the catalyst surface. Steam reforming reactions of methane 
 
2 CH4 + MO → C2H6 + H2O + M   
      (23) 
 
M + H2O → MO + 2 H2  
 
 
      (24) 
 
could also occur simultaneously, yielding CO and CO2. A variety 
of Ti-containing perovskite oxide structures were examined for 
this reaction, and it was found that partially substituting Ti4+ with 
Mg2+ or Ca2+ shifts the product distribution from predominately 
COx to C2 products. However, the overall product yield remains 
very low (<1%). Nevertheless, various studies have reported 
improved activity and C2 selectivity in O2-OCM when H2O is 
included as an additive, although the mechanism of such 
improvement is not agreed upon.[72] Thus, future research should 
address the mechanism of H2O/O2 cofeeding rather than H2O as 
a sole oxidant.  
       OCM may also proceed in solid oxide membrane cells via 
electrochemically derived O2- ions. The attraction of this approach 
is that by changing the electrode potential or current passing 
through the cell, the reaction rate and selectivity can also be 
influenced.[73] Early studies examined electrocatalytic OCM using 
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as a catalyst and solid oxide 
oxygen source.[73-74] In general, electrochemically provided 
oxygen leads to higher C2 yields compared to gas phase O2, 
although the selectivity decreases with higher oxygen flux.[73, 74b, 
74c] More recently, Zhu and coworkers used perovskite anodes for 
electrocatalytic OCM and achieved a maximum C2 selectivity of 
82.2%, a maximum CH4 conversion of 40.5%, and an C2H4/C2H6 
ratio of 2.2/1.[75] Their system also coupled OCM with CO2 
electrolysis at the cathode. Thus, electrocatalytic OCM may be a 
promising method to produce C2’s from methane while also 
utilizing greenhouse gases.  
      As can be inferred from the above discussion, although it is 
chemically feasible to use other oxygen-containing gases (NO, 
NO2, SO2, SO3, O3, and H2O) as oxidants for OCM, these systems 
suffer from inherent low activity, preference for total oxidation, or 
catalyst deactivation. As such, most OCM research using 
alternative oxidants has focused on N2O, CO2, and S2 oxidants 
that are able to provide appreciable C2 yields and stable catalytic 
activity.  
6. Summary and Outlook 
To date, N2O and CO2 have received the most attention as 
alternative oxidants for OCM, with S2 emerging as another 
contender in the recent decade. These oxidants are all milder 
compared to O2, and as such are capable of yielding promising 
OCM selectivity to C2 products. Additionally, for N2O, CO2, and 
S2 OCM systems, the role of the oxidant in providing surface O or 
S species that activate CH4 has been emphasized.  
N2O-OCM research has generally focused on basic alkaline 
earth and rare earth metal oxides. While these catalysts are also 
frequently employed for O2-OCM, N2O provides selective O* 
species that lead to enhanced C2 selectivities compared to O2, 
even over the same catalyst at isoconversion. Because N2O-OCM 
is more selective, it may also facilitate heat management, since 
overoxidation is much more exothermic than the coupling reaction. 
However, the high cost of the oxidant challenges practical 
application, and the product stream also becomes diluted with N2, 
which would likely necessitate additional separation steps. 
Nevertheless, N2O-OCM is a useful process for studying the role 
of adsorbed oxygen species and highlights that high C2 yields are 
possible if the presence of unselective oxygen species can be 
controlled. Moving forward, new process designs such as 
membrane reactors may also help mitigate some of the 
drawbacks of N2O-OCM. 
       In contrast, many CO2-OCM catalysts are binary oxides that 
contain a basic and a redox-active component. This combination 
permits both CO2 adsorption onto the catalyst surface and 
activation to yield CO and O*. Compared to O2-OCM, CO2-OCM 
has generated lower C2 yields, although the C2 selectivities are 
comparable.[76] The main challenge is low CH4 conversion due to

assisted CO2-OCM may help mitigate this issue if more selective 
catalysts can be developed, although the industrial applicability of 
these unconventional processes may be limited. Another 
interesting possibility could be a combined process of O2-OCM 
and CO2-OCM, where both O2 and CO2 are cofed in order to 
achieve sufficient CH4 conversion while also controlling the C2 
selectivity and reaction exothermicity.   
In SOCM, transition metal sulfide surfaces have been 
shown to be the most promising catalysts, with both lattice sulfur 
and adsorbed sulfur acting as active sites. The use of sulfur may 
present unique challenges, such as the formation of CS2. 
However, if the CS2 formation can be suppressed, the principal 
sulfur-byproduct, H2S, could be recycled back to elemental sulfur 
via the efficient industrial Claus process. Additionally, the 
mechanistic studies of SOCM over sulfided Fe3O4 reveal that CS2 
primarily forms on different active sites than methane coupling. As 
such, future research should focus on designing catalysts with 
fewer non-selective sulfur dimer sites and higher densities of M-
S active sites. Alternate process designs such as chemical 
looping or site-specific poisoning may also be valuable in 
improving C2 selectivity and provide more mechanistic insight on 
the role of the sulfide surface.  
      Thus far, replacing O2 with alternative oxidants for OCM has 
proven to an effective method for selectively producing C2 
hydrocarbons (ethane and ethylene). A summary of the key 
results for each oxidant, including O2 [77], is provided in Table 3. 
The accomplished work has also provided valuable fundamental 
insight into how CH4 interacts with various oxidants over oxide 
and sulfide catalyst surfaces. Moving forward, future research in 
X-OCM is needed to design catalysts and reactor systems that 
facilitate 
activation 
of the methane 
C-H 
bond without 
simultaneous CH4 combustion or further activation of the weaker 
C-H bonds of C2 products.

The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane to C2 products with O2 (O2-OCM) is challenged by overoxidation to CO and CO2, despite 
extensive research. OCM with alternative oxidants such as N2O, CO2, S2 may provide a route to higher C2 selectivities. In this review, 
we analyze progress on catalytic OCM with alternative oxidants, discussing the current status and future prospects.
