Abstract 
Iron-zeolites with well-defined extra-framework iron species were prepared via organometallic 
chemistry grafting route, i.e. the surface reaction between ferrocene and Brønsted acid sites in 
zeolites, and the calcined iron-zeolites were studied as catalysts for N2O-mediated oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The framework structures of zeolite hosts and the 
calcination temperatures showed great impact on the catalytic performances. Fe-ZSM-5 calcined at 
1073 K exhibited the highest activity for N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation and a 
maximal initial propylene yield of ca. 30 %  can be obtained at a reaction temperature of 748 K 
(after time-on-stream of 15 min). A transformation of iron sites in Fe-ZSM-5 upon high-temperature 
calcination was well established based on the spectroscopic characterization results from UV-Vis, 
H2-TPR, EPR and FTIR of NO adsorption. According to the correlation between catalytic activity 
and iron sites, extra-framework Fe-O-Al species are proposed to be the preferred active sites for 
N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. Introduction 
Iron-zeolites with extra-framework iron species have attracted special attention due to their 
remarkable activity in N2O-involved reactions, e.g. the catalytic decomposition and reduction of N2O 
[1-8], the N2O-mediated benzene hydroxylation [9-14] and N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation 
of propane (ODHP) [15-23]. To our knowledge, iron-zeolites have been successfully commercialized 
in the process of N2O abatement from nitric acid plants by Uhde [24] and the process of

N2O-mediated benzene hydroxylation to phenol by SOLUTIA [25]. The N2O-mediated ODHP has 
been proposed as an alternative promising route for the production of propylene. 
As for the N2O-involved reactions catalyzed by iron-zeolites, the most important thing to know is 
what the active iron sites are and how to produce them on purpose. However, great contradictions 
still exist in the identification of active iron sites for N2O-involved reactions, which may keep us 
away from the reliable structure-activity relationship for these reactions. Taking the N2O-mediated 
ODHP for example, Bulánek et al. [15] claimed that the catalytic activity of Fe-ZSM-5 could be 
ascribed to the presence of extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes, similar to that reported by Panov et 
al. [26] in N2O-mediated benzene hydroxylation. While Kondratenko et al. [16] proposed that 
oligonuclear iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 was more active than isolated iron species for N2O-mediated 
ODHP, probably due to the higher mobility of atomic oxygen species attached to oligonuclear iron 
species formed upon nitrous oxide chemisorption. Pérez-Ramírez et al. [18] suggested that traces of 
well-isolated iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 be extremely active in N2O-mediated ODHP, while large iron 
clusters enhance the deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to COx. 
The controversies on active iron sites in N2O-involved reactions, to a large extent, depend on the 
complicated constitution of iron sites in iron-zeolites and the resulting difficulty in the 
characterization of specific iron sites. Generally, extra-framework iron species in iron-zeolites may 
be present as isolated and oligonuclear cationic species, as well as neutral iron oxides with varying 
degrees of aggregation. Numerous techniques, including but not limited to Mössbauer spectroscopy 
[27], UV-Vis spectroscopy [7, 28], EPR spectroscopy [29, 30] and X-ray absorption spectroscopy [31, 
32], have been applied to the characterization of iron sites in iron-zeolites. Due to the limitation of 
each single characterization technique, multiple characterization techniques should be used

simultaneously with cross-reference to provide more accurate information on the specific iron sites. 
The preparation of iron-zeolites is the initial step in the study of iron-zeolites, and a simple and 
reproducible preparation route is highly desired. Moreover, the proper preparation of iron-zeolites 
with relatively simple constitution of iron species can greatly reduce the difficulty in the 
characterization of iron sites. Various methods, e.g. ion-exchange and isomorphous substitution 
followed by extraction, have been proposed for the preparation of iron-zeolites with extra-framework 
iron species. Isomorphous substitution is an efficient method to introduce low concentration Fe 
species into the zeolite framework and extra-framework iron species can be obtained after 
subsequent extraction. In this case, the constitution of iron sites is greatly dependent on the 
extraction procedure [33]. Liquid phase ion exchange is a simple and feasible means to prepare 
iron-zeolite, as it involves fewer steps and the preparation parameters are easily controlled. However, 
due to the complicated solution behavior of ferric and ferrous ions as well as the diffusion problem 
during ion exchange, a lack of reproducibility may be a problem for the iron-zeolites prepared by 
solution ion exchange [34]. To solve the problem, solid-state ion exchange [35] and vapor phase ion 
exchange (also known as chemical vapor deposition) [36] have been adopted to prepare fully or 
over-exchanged iron-zeolites. Recently, a surface organometallic chemistry grafting route, i.e. the 
reaction between ferrocene and Brønsted acid sites in zeolites, has been proposed for the preparation 
of iron-zeolites [37]. This grafting route can be regarded as an improved solid-state ion exchange 
route using ferrocene instead of FeCl3 as reactant. Interestingly, the iron sites in iron-zeolites, i.e. 
Fe-HY, prepared via grafting route exhibit low nuclearity and good activity in phenol hydroxylation 
reaction [38]. 
In the present study, a series of iron-zeolites are prepared by the grafting route and studied as

possible catalysts for N2O-mediated ODHP. The iron sites in Fe-MFI are characterized by multiple 
techniques with cross-reference, and the transformation of iron sites upon high-temperature 
calcination is revealed. Based on the characterization and catalytic results, the active iron sites for 
N2O-mediated ODHP are discussed and the structure-activity relationship is identified, which are of 
great significance for the rational design of highly-active iron-zeolites. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Catalyst preparation 
A series of alumino-silicate zeolites in their H-form with different framework structure (MFI: 
H-ZSM-5, MOR: H-modenite, FAU: H-USY, FER: H-ZSM-35, BEA: H-Beta) were provided by 
Sinopec and employed as hosts for iron species. Prior to being used as hosts, the zeolite samples 
were calcined in flowing air at 873 K for 6 h. Fe-zeolite samples were prepared by the so-called 
grafting method. During the grafting process, the organometallic Fe precursor ferrocene sublimated 
at elevated temperature and then reacted with the Brønsted acid sites in zeolites [37, 38]. In a typical 
experiment, a zeolite sample of ca. 3g was placed in a quartz reaction chamber connected to a 
vacuum line and treated under vacuum of 5*10-2 Pa at 573 K for 4 h. After cooling to 323 K, 0.5 g 
ferrocene was added into the reaction chamber and the chamber was then heated to 423 K. The 
chamber was kept at 423 K under vacuum for 24 h to insure the complete surface reaction between 
ferrocene and the Brønsted acid sites in zeolites. The resulting solid was then subjected to calcination 
in flowing air at different temperatures for 6 h. The final product was labeled as Fe-zeolite-xG-y, 
where x indicated the Si/Al ratio of zeolite, G indicated the grafting preparation method and y 
indicated the calcination temperature.

For reference, Fe-MFI samples were also prepared by reductive liquid-phase ion exchange, 
solid-state ion exchange and isomorphous substitution followed by extraction. In a typical 
experiment of reductive liquid-phase ion exchange, 0.5 g zeolite MFI sample was placed in the 
three-necked flask and exchanged with 200 mL 0.1 M FeCl2 aqueous solution for two days under the 
protection of nitrogen (pH = 3). The resulting solid was thoroughly washed with deionized water, 
dried at 353 K overnight and calcined in flowing air at 1073 K for 6 h. The final product was labeled 
as Fe-MFI-24LE-1073, where 24 indicated the Si/Al ratio of MFI zeolite, LE indicated the 
liquid-phase ion exchange preparation method and 1073 indicated the calcination temperature. In a 
typical experiment of solid-state ion exchange, 0.5 g zeolite MFI sample was mechanically mixed 
with 0.5 g FeCl3 in the glove box and the mixture was placed in a sealed reactor. The reactor was 
heated to 573 K at 10 K/min and kept at this temperature for 2 h. The resulting solid was thoroughly 
washed with deionized water, dried at 353 K overnight and calcined in flowing air at 1073 K for 6 h. 
The final product was labeled as Fe-MFI-24SE-1073, where 24 indicated the Si/Al ratio of MFI 
zeolite, SE indicated the solid-state ion exchange preparation method and 1073 indicated the 
calcination temperature. In a typical experiment of isomorphous substitution, a solution of 
tetraethylorthosilicate (Alfa Aesar), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 20% solution in 
water, Alfa Aesar), aluminum nitrate (Alfa Aesar) and ferric nitrate (Alfa Aesar) was prepared with 
the proportion of 300 SiO2: 6Al2O3: Fe2O3: 90 TPAOH: 12000 H2O. After vigorous stirring for 2 h, 
the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for static crystallization at 448 
K for 120 h. The resulting solid was filtrated, thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried at 353 
K overnight, calcined in flowing air at 873 K for 6 h, and activated in 10% H2O/air at 873 K for 4 h. 
The final product was labeled as Fe-MFI-24IS-873, where 24 indicated the Si/Al ratio of MFI zeolite,

IS indicated the isomorphous substitution followed by extraction preparation method and 873 
indicated the extraction temperature. 
2.2 Catalyst characterization 
The Si, Al and Fe contents in samples were analyzed by a Perkin Elmer Optima 2000 inductively 
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). 
The specific surface areas of samples were determined through low temperature N2 
adsorption/desorption isotherms collected on a Quantachrome iQ-MP gas adsorption analyzer. 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE 
powder diffractometer using Cu-K radiation (= 0.1542 nm) at a scanning rate of 4 o/min in the 
region of 2θ = 5-40o. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a Philips Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN 
electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. A few drops of alcohol suspension 
containing the sample were placed on a carbon-coated copper grid, followed by evaporation at 
ambient temperature. 
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of samples were measured on a 
Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. A self-supporting pellet 
made of sample was placed in the reaction chamber and pretreated in flowing dry air at 473 K for 1h. 
The spectra were recorded in dry air against KBr as background. 
Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of samples were recorded in air against 
BaSO4 in the region of 200-800 nm on a Varian Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. 
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out on a Quantachrome 
ChemBET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. A sample of ca. 0.1 g was pretreated in flowing 5%O2/Ar at 
Page 10 of 41

873 K for 1h, cooled to 323 K in the same atmosphere and purged with 5%H2/Ar for 30 min. 
H2-TPR was then carried out in flowing 5%H2/Ar in the temperature range of 323-873 K at a heating 
rate of 10 K/min. 
The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were carried out with a 
Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. A sample of ca. 0.1 g was pretreated in 
flowing He at 873 K for 1h, cooled to 373 K in He and saturated with 5% NH3/He. After that, the 
sample was purged with He for 30 min to eliminate the physisorbed ammonia. NH3-TPD was then 
carried out in flowing He in the temperature range of 373-873 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. 
Solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) experiments of fully 
hydrated samples were performed on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at resonance frequencies of 
104.3 and 79.5 MHz for 27Al and 29Si, respectively. The 27Al MAS-NMR spectra were recorded with 
a sample spinning rate of 8 kHz, while the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra were obtained with 4 kHz. The 
decomposition and simulation of NMR spectra were carried out using the Bruker software 
WINNMR and WINFIT. 
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra in the X-band region were recorded with a Bruker 
EMX-6/1 spectrometer at 120 K with a microwave power of 5.0 mW and a modulation frequencyof 
100 kHz. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) was used as an internal standard for the 
measurement of the magnetic field. 
FTIR spectra with NO as probe were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 128 scans 
at a resolution of 2 cm−1. A self-supporting pellet made of the catalyst sample was placed in the 
reaction chamber and pretreated in flowing He at 773 K for 1h. After cooling to room temperature in 
flowing He, the He stream was switched to 1%NO/He and a series of time-dependent FTIR spectra

were sequentially recorded. 
2.3 Catalytic evaluation 
The catalytic evaluation was performed in a fixed-bed flow micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. 
Typically, 0.2 g catalyst sample (sieve fraction of 0.17-0.25 mm) was placed in a quartz reactor (4 
mm i.d.) and pretreated in 15% N2O/He at 823 K for 1 h. After cooling to the designated temperature, 
the reactant gas mixture (7.5% C3H8, 15% N2O, balance He) was fed to the reactor at a total flow rate 
of 50 mL min−1, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15,000 mL h-1 g-1. The 
catalytic reactions were conducted isothermally at designated temperatures and the gas products were 
analyzed after 15-min reaction (quasi steady-state reaction with C balance of > 90%) by using two 
on-line gas chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a Plot Q capillary column and a FID 
detector for the analysis of organic products, the other with two packed columns (Porapak Q and 
Carbon Molecular Sieve TDX) and TCD detector for the analysis of N2O, N2, O2 and COx. The water 
was removed from the gas products before the chromatograph inlet and possible small change of the 
reaction volume was neglected in the formulas used for conversion, selectivity and yield calculations. 
The conversion, selectivity and yield are defined as follows:

3. Results 
3.1 Physico-chemical properties of Fe-MFI prepared via grafting 
The results of surface organometallic chemistry reaction between ferrocene and zeolites, and some 
physicochemical properties of the as-prepared Fe-zeolites under study are summarized in Table 1. 
Iron species can be introduced to the zeolite host through the reaction between ferrocene (kinetic 
diameter: 0.46*0.32 nm) and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=23.7, pore dimension: [100] 0.51*0.55nm ↔ [010] 
0.53*0.56nm), and an iron loading of 1.82 % is obtained in Fe-MFI-24G. The Fe/Al ratio of 0.48 
indicates that each iron atom is approximately bound to two Brønsted acid sites, in consistence with 
the EXAFS results on Fe-HY prepared via a similar grafting route [38]. After calcination, the iron 
loading in Fe-MFI-24G decreases distinctly due to the loss of iron species during the calcination 
process, and higher calcination temperature results in more severe loss of iron species. The distinct 
loss of iron species does not happen with Fe-MFI prepared by other methods, i.e. reductive solution 
ion exchange with FeCl2 and conventional solid-state ion exchange with FeCl3. Presently, we are not 
very sure about the exact reasons and more detailed investigations are required. When H-ZSM-5 
zeolites with different Si/Al ratios (12, 24 and 48) are employed as hosts for the preparation of 
iron-zeolites via grafting, Fe/Al ratios of 0.15-0.18 can be obtained in the final products. When 
zeolites with different framework structures are employed as hosts for the preparation of iron-zeolites 
via grafting, Fe/Al ratios of 0.16-0.23 are obtained, indicating that the grafting method may be 
general route to iron-zeolites. 
Fig. S1 displays the XRD patterns of Fe-zeolites employed in this study. For Fe-zeolite-xG-1073 
(left figure), diffraction lines corresponding to zeolite hosts are observed exclusively [39]. For

Fe-MFI-24G-y (right figure), high temperature calcinations at 873-1173 K do not result in visible 
changes in the diffraction lines of MFI host. It is evident that the framework structure of zeolite hosts 
can be well preserved after the introduction of iron species by grafting and subsequent calcination in 
air. The absence of diffraction lines corresponding to iron oxides excludes the formation of bulk iron 
oxides. 
The TEM images of Fe-MFI-24G samples calcined at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 1. 
For Fe-MFI-24G-873, small clusters with sizes of less than 2 nm are observed to disperse on the 
surface of MFI zeolite or inside the channels. For Fe-MFI-24G calcined at higher temperatures of 
973-1073 K, the clusters become smaller and almost invisible. Meanwhile, the lattice structure of 
MFI zeolite can be clearly observed, confirming that the framework structure of MFI is well 
preserved upon high temperature calcination. 
The hydroxyl stretching region of DRIFT spectra of H-MFI and Fe-MFI samples are shown in Fig. 
S2. A strong band at 3610 cm-1 corresponding to Brønsted acid hydroxyl groups and a weak band at 
3740 cm-1 corresponding to silanol groups are observed for the H-MFI sample [40, 41]. After the 
introduction of iron species by grafting and subsequent calcination at 873 K, the IR band 
corresponding to Brønsted acid hydroxyl groups shifts to lower wave number of 3590 cm-1 due to the 
framework distortion induced by iron species, and the intensity of the band decreases dramatically. 
Meanwhile, a new IR band at 3660 cm-1 corresponding to hydroxyls attached to extra-framework 
aluminum species and iron species [42, 43] appears. Increasing the calcination temperatures from 
873 to 1173 K leads to the partial elimination of Brønsted acid hydroxyl groups and hydroxyls 
attached to extra-framework aluminum species and iron species, as reflected by the decreases in the 
intensities of the corresponding IR bands at 3660 and 3590 cm-1.

The acidic properties of H-MFI and Fe-MFI were evaluated by NH3-TPD and the results are 
shown in Fig. S3. Two major types of ammonia desorption peaks can be observed on H-MFI: a 
low-temperature peak at 400-600 K corresponding to weak acid sites and a high-temperature peak at 
600-800 K corresponding to strong acid sites. The high-temperature peak originates from the 
desorption of NH3 strongly interacting with the Brønsted acid sites in MFI and the intensity of this 
peak can be used for the qualitative analysis of Brønsted acid sites in the specific case of MFI [44]. 
During the preparation of Fe-MFI by grafting, the ferrocene precursor reacts with the protons in 
Brønsted acid hydroxyls and therefore leads to significant decrease in the concentration of Brønsted 
acid hydroxyl groups. It is also observed that intensities of the ammonia desorption peaks, both 
high-temperature peak and low-temperature peak, gradually decrease with increasing calcination 
temperatures from 873 to 1173 K, probably due to the re-arrangement and elimination of various 
hydroxyl groups upon thermal treatments. 
Fig. S4 displays the 27Al and 29SiMAS NMR spectra of Fe-MFI-24G samples calcined at different 
temperatures. In the 27Al MAS NMR spectra, strong signals centered at 55 ppm are observed for 
Fe-MFI-24G-873 and these signals should be attributed to tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum at 
non-equivalent framework positions [45]. Besides, weak signals centered at ca. 0 ppm are observed, 
indicating the presence of octahedrally coordinated extra-framework aluminum species [46]. With 
increasing calcination temperatures, the 27Al MAS NMR signals become much broader, probably due 
to the perturbance from paramagnetic iron species with unpaired electrons [47]. Nevertheless, it can 
be observed that the percentage of extra-framework aluminum species increases distinctly with 
increasing calcination temperatures from 973 to 1173 K, indicating the framework dealumination 
upon high temperature calcinations. In 29Si MAS NMR spectra, two strong signals at -113 and -116

ppm corresponding to Si*(OSi)4 sites and one weak signal at -106 ppm corresponding to 
AlOSi*(OSi)3 sites [48, 49] are observed for Fe-MFI-24G-873. High-temperature calcinations lead 
to the decrease in the intensity of 29Si NMR signal at -106 ppm corresponding to AlOSi*(OSi)3 sites, 
due to the framework dealumination upon thermal treatment as confirmed by the 27Al MAS NMR 
results. 
3.2 Characterization of iron sites in Fe-MFI 
Fig. 2 displays the UV-Vis spectra of Fe-MFI-24G samples calcined at different temperatures. All 
Fe-MFI samples exhibit strong absorbance in 200-600 nm region, corresponding to O→Fe ligand to 
metal charge transfer transitions in various ferric ions. Typically, the absorbance occurring at 215 and 
245 nm is attributed to isolated ferric ions in tetrahedral coordination, while the absorbance at 275 
nm is attributed to isolated ferric ions in octahedral coordination [14, 28]. Generally, the absorbance 
between 300 and 400 nm is attributed to octahedral ferric ions in oligonuclear FexOy clusters, while 
the absorbance at above 400 nm is attributed to large Fe2O3 nanoparticles [50]. It has been argued 
that dinuclear ferric ions in hydrated Fe-MFI sample also showed UV absorption below 300 nm [50] 
and it should be more careful when dealing with UV-Vis spectra. Nevertheless, it can be concluded 
from UV-Vis spectra that isolated ferric ions and oligonuclear FexOy clusters are the dominant iron 
species in Fe-MFI. High temperature calcinations at 1073 and 1173 K result in the distinct decreases 
in the percentage of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. 
The H2-TPR profiles of Fe-MFI-24G samples calcined at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 
3. A mechanical mixture of 2wt.% γ-Fe2O3 with H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=24) was prepared and its H2-TPR 
profile is also shown for reference. A broad H2 consumption peak in the temperature range of 
600-950 K is observed for sample 2% Fe2O3/H-MFI and the total H/Fe ratio of 2.9 reveals that 
Page 16 of 41

14 
 
almost all the ferric ions can be reduced to metallic iron below 950 K. For the Fe-MFI-24G samples, 
broad H2 consumption peaks in the temperature range of 600-950 K are observed as well. The total 
H/Fe ratios are calculated to be 1.1-1.3, depending on the calcination temperature. The H/Fe ratio of 
1 corresponds to the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions. It has been reported that the reduction of 
ferrous ions in isolated state or oligonuclear clusters to metallic iron is accompanied by the collapse 
of zeolite framework and the peaks of H2 consumption should appear well over 1000 K [7, 44]. 
Therefore, the H/Fe ratios of close to 1 reveal that the iron species in Fe-MFI-24G mainly exist in the 
form of isolated ferric ions and oligonuclear ferric clusters. It should be noted that the H2 
consumption peak in H2-TPR profiles of Fe-MFI-24G slightly shifts to higher temperatures with 
increasing calcination temperature. 
Fig. 4 displays the EPR spectra of Fe-MFI-24G samples calcined at different temperatures. For 
Fe-MFI-24G-873, strong EPR signals at g’ = 2.0 and weak g’ = 4.3 can be observed. The g’ = 4.3 
signal should originate from the ferric ions in tetrahedral coordination while signals at g’ = 2.0 may 
originate from highly symmetric isolated ferric ions and/or small oligomers with weak dipolar 
coupling.  [31, 51]. The latter would cause the considerable line width observed in the spectra. With 
increasing calcination temperature, the intensity of g’ = 2.0 EPR signal decreases, while the intensity 
of g’ = 4.3 EPR signal increases. Obviously, the iron sites in Fe-MFI undergo transformation upon 
high temperature calcination. 
FTIR spectroscopy with NO probe is informative and sensitive technique for the characterization 
of iron sites in zeolite [52-54]. The characteristic of this technique lies in that only exposed iron sites 
can be explored, while iron sites in sub-surface position or buried inside cannot be detected. Thus, it 
can provide us with necessary information on the available or so-called working iron sites in

catalytic reactions. It should also be mentioned that the adsorption of NO on oxidized ferric ions is 
negligible at room temperature, and the nitrosyls are formed exclusively with the participation of 
ferrous ions [52]. Therefore, the Fe-MFI samples calcined in air are further treated in flowing He at 
773 K for 1h to induce the auto-reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions [44, 55]. Through this process, 
easy reducible iron species can be auto-reduced and these iron species should be most active for the 
activation of nitrous oxide [29].  
Fig. 5 displays the FTIR spectra of NO adsorption on Fe-MFI samples at room temperature. NO 
adsorption on Fe-MFI without calcination, i.e. Fe-MFI-24G, results in a broad band centered at 1850 
cm-1, which should be assigned to mono-nitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5 
[56, 57]. According to the grafting preparation method, the ferrous ions could be in the form of 
exchanged isolated ions or in oligonuclear clusters formed during the removal of cyclopentadiene 
ligands. For Fe-MFI-24G-873, NO adsorption results in the appearance of two strong bands at 1875 
and 1890 cm-1, and one weak band at 1855 cm-1. The band at 1855 cm-1 should be shifted from the 
band at 1850 cm-1, due to the change in the environment and nuclearity through calcination. The 
band at 1875 cm-1 is assigned to mono-nitrosyl on extra-framework Fe2+-O-Al species [54, 58], while 
the band at 1890 cm-1 is assigned to mono-nitrosyl on isolated ferrous ions located at the γ sites of 
ZSM-5 structure [6, 36]. It is evident that calcination in air results in the transformation of iron sites 
Fe-MFI, i.e. from isolated ions or oligonuclear clusters in the straight channels of ZSM-5 to isolated 
ions in the sinusoidal channels and extra-framework Fe-O-Al species. With increasing calcination 
temperatures from 873 to 1073 K, all the detectable ferrous iron species transform to 
extra-framework Fe-O-Al species. While for Fe-MFI-24G-1173, NO saturated adsorption results in 
the appearance of a broad IR band centered at around 1810 cm-1, corresponding to poly-nitrosyl on

isolated ferrous ions (Fe2+(NO)n, n≥2) [52-55]. Since the initial adsorption of NO on 
Fe-MFI-24G-1173 results in the appearance of IR band at 1875 cm-1, the IR bands at 1810 and 1875 
cm-1 should be originated from the same ferrous species, i.e. isolated extra-framework Fe2+-O-Al 
species. The formation of poly-nitrosyl species requires sufficient space, and therefore the Fe-O-Al 
species in Fe-MFI-24G-1173 should be located at more accessible position than that in 
Fe-MFI-24G-1073. 
3.3 Catalytic performance of iron-zeolites 
The catalytic performance of iron-zeolite samples calcined at 1073 K (quasi steady-state after 
time-on-stream of 15 min) in N2O-mediated ODHP at 748 K is shown in Fig. S5. Fe-zeolites with 
different framework structures and similar Si/Al ratios exhibit quite different catalytic behavior. 
Fe-FER-12G exhibits quite low dehydrogenation activity and COx (CO and CO2) are detected as 
exclusive products from propane-N2O reaction. In contrast, Fe-MOR-12G, Fe-BEA-12G, 
Fe-FAU-12G and Fe-MFI-12G exhibit certain dehydrogenation activity, and the desired product 
propylene can be detected together with the undesired product COx. Amongst, Fe-MFI-12G exhibits 
the highest propane conversion of ca. 38% and propylene selectivity of ca. 64%, leading to the 
propylene yield of ca. 24 %. Besides the major by-product COx, trace acrolein and some other 
oxygenates (<2 %) can be detected in the products. The Si/Al ratios of MFI zeolite hosts slightly 
influence the catalytic performance of Fe-MFI-xG samples in N2O-mediated ODHP. Typically, the 
highest propylene yield of ca. 30 %, with propane conversion of 46 % and propylene selectivity of 
ca. 65 %, is obtained with the Fe-MFI-24G catalyst. 
Fe-MFI-24G calcined at different temperatures were studied as catalysts for N2O-mediated ODHP, 
and the results are shown in Fig. 6. For all Fe-MFI-G catalysts, the propane and N2O conversions

gradually increase with increasing reaction temperature, while the propylene selectivity decreases 
with increasing reaction temperatures. The calcination temperatures show strong impact on the 
catalytic performance of Fe-MFI-G. Typically, the propane and N2O conversions decrease with 
increasing calcination temperature from 873 to 1173 K, while the propylene selectivity increases 
with increasing calcination temperature. The highest propylene yield of ca. 30 % can be obtained 
over Fe-MFI-1073 at the reaction temperature of 748 K. 
Fig. S6 displays the results of N2O decomposition over Fe-MFI-24G calcined at different 
temperatures. Significant N2O decomposition to N2 and O2 starts at ca. 648 K over all Fe-MFI-24G 
catalysts, and the N2O conversion increases with increasing reaction temperatures. The calcination 
temperatures of Fe-MFI-24G samples show distinct influence on the N2O decomposition activity. 
Typically, N2O decomposition activity over Fe-MFI-24G decreases with increasing calcination 
temperatures from 673 to 1173 K, similar to the changing trend of N2O conversion in N2O-mediated 
ODHP (Fig. 6). 
The result of propane oxidation with O2 catalyzed by Fe-MFI-24G-1073 is shown in Fig. S7. 
Propane conversion starts at ca. 573 K and then gradually increases to ca. 90 % with increasing 
reaction temperature from 573 to 773 K. The main oxidation products are CO and CO2, while only 
very low percentage of propylene (<10 %) can be detected at 698 to 773 K. Based on the results 
presented in Fig. 6 & S7, the use of N2O as an oxidant predominantly leads to the dehydrogenation 
of propane to propylene, while the use of O2 as an oxidant leads to the deep oxidation of propane to 
COx. It is thus confirmed that N2O can be used as mono-oxygen donor and the active oxygen species 
from N2O chemisorption on specific iron sites facilitate the dehydrogenation of alkanes [59]. 
The iron-zeolites suffer serious deactivation by coke in N2O-mediated ODHP and rapid decreases

in propylene yield are reported [18-20]. Therefore, the deactivation and regeneration of selected 
catalyst Fe-MFI-24G-1073 in N2O-mediated ODHP are further investigated. As shown in Fig. 7, a 
steady decrease in propane conversion and propylene yield is observed. Typically, the propylene 
yield decreases from ca. 30 % to 12 % in time-on-stream of 960 min. After regeneration in 15% 
N2O/He at 748 K for 120 min, the catalytic activity of Fe-MFI-24G-1073 in N2O-mediated ODHP 
can recover to the initial level. The regenerated catalyst exhibits similar deactivation behavior to the 
fresh catalyst. This suggests that the Fe-MFI-24G-1073 catalyst can be continuously regenerated for 
N2O-mediated ODHP, which is quite important for industrial application. 
 
4. Discussion 
4.1 Advantages of grafting preparation method to Fe-MFI 
The preparation of Fe-zeolites is a very important issue and a simple route to active Fe-zeolites is 
highly desired. However, a lack of reproducibility has been claimed for the preparation of Fe-zeolite 
due to the intrinsic complexity of iron species as well as their interaction with zeolite host [33, 60]. 
The formation of different iron species in Fe-zeolite is very sensitive to the preparation parameters 
and a slight modification on the preparation process may lead to quite different iron site constitutions 
and different catalytic activities. The grafting method employed in this study is a kind of solid-state 
ion exchange using organometallic ferrocene as iron precursor. The chemical reaction between 
ferrocene and the Brønsted acid sites in zeolite ensures the strong bonding of iron species to the 
zeolite host and the existence of cyclopentadiene ligands in ferrocene effectively prevents the 
aggregation of iron species. In a repeated preparation of Fe-MFI-24G-1073 via grafting, the obtained 
iron loading was quite similar to that obtained in the original experiment (Table 2). Furthermore, the

catalytic performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, including the maximal propylene yield, propane 
conversion and propylene selectivity, of both preparations of Fe-MFI-24G-1073 are almost identical 
(Table 2). These results clearly confirm that the grafting preparation method is feasible route to 
Fe-MFI with excellent reproducibility. 
Based on the literature reports, the steam-activated isomorphously-substituted Fe-ZSM-5 are the 
most active catalysts for the N2O-mediated ODHP [17-19]. To make a fair comparison between 
various catalysts, the catalytic performance of Fe-MFI samples prepared by different methods was 
evaluated under identical reaction conditions in the present study. As shown in Table 2, Fe-MFI 
prepared by grafting method exhibits distinctly higher activity for N2O-mediated ODHP than Fe-MFI 
samples prepared by other methods with similar Si/Al ratios. The turnover frequency for propylene 
production over Fe-MFI-24IS-873 is calculated to be 0.033 s-1, quite similar to the most recent result 
reported by Sazama et. al [61]. While a higher turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1, with both higher 
propane conversion and propylene selectivity, can be obtained with our Fe-MFI-24G-1073. 
Considering the rather low turnover frequency for propylene production over Fe-MFI-24SE-1073 
prepared by conventional solid-state ion  exchange (0.004 s-1), the use of ferrocene instead of FeCl3 
for solid-state ion exchange shows its great advantage in the preparation of Fe-MFI for 
N2O-mediated ODHP. 
4.2 Transformation of iron sites in Fe-MFI upon high-temperature calcinations 
Through the surface reaction between ferrocene and Brønsted acid sites in MFI zeolites, 
mononuclear cyclopentadiene-iron complexes should be formed and bonded to the zeolite surface, 
similar to those reported for Fe-HY [37]. During drying and calcination in the air, the 
cyclopentadiene ligands are removed and ferrous ions are oxidized to ferric ions. The strong

interaction between iron species and zeolite surface as well as the existence of cyclopentadiene 
ligands effectively prevents the aggregation of ions species and the formation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles 
is greatly avoided. As a result, isolated ferric ions and oligonuclear clusters are obtained as dominant 
extra-framework iron species in Fe-MFI-24G-673, as revealed by the characterization results from 
UV-Vis (Fig. 2) and H2-TPR (Fig. 3). 
For Fe/ZSM-5 prepared by chemical vapor deposition of FeCl3, high temperature thermal or 
hydrothermal treatment would lead to the transformation of iron species and, therefore, show great 
impacts on the catalytic activities [62, 63]. In the present study, the transformation of iron sites in 
Fe-MFI prepared by grafting upon high-temperature calcinations is clearly observed (also visualized 
by the changes of sample color from brown to light yellow, as shown in Fig. 8). The results from 
DRIFT spectra (Fig. S2), NH3-TPD profiles (Fig. S3) and NMR spectra (Fig. S4) indicate the 
dealumination of MFI zeolites during calcination at elevated temperatures. Accompanied by the 
dealumination process, the transformation of iron species take place (UV-Vis spectra in Fig. 2, 
H-TPR profiles in Fig. 3 and ESR spectra in Fig. 4) and the transformation of iron species in Fe-MFI 
accordingly results in the changes of catalytic activities in N2O-mediated ODHP (Fig. 6) and N2O 
decomposition (Fig. S6). 
The TEM image of Fe-MFI-24G-673 shows the presence of small clusters of < 2 nm on the 
surface of MFI zeolite or inside the channels (Fig. 1). These clusters could be due to Fe2O3 
nanoparticles and/or large oligonuclear FexOy species. Considering that the percentage of Fe2O3 
nanoparticles in Fe-MFI-24G-673 is estimated to be below 5 % based on the UV-Vis spectra, the 
contribution of Fe2O3 nanoparticles with very low loadings (< 5 %*1.39 % = 695 ppm) to the visible 
clusters can be neglected. The visible clusters in the TEM images gradually disappear with

increasing calcination temperatures from 673 to 1073 K (Fig. 1), due to the re-dispersion of iron 
species upon high-temperature calcinations similar to the re-dispersion of platinum species on 
different supports [64,65]. 
4.3 Active iron sites for N2O-mediated ODHP 
Based on literature reports, N2O decomposition over Fe-zeolite proceeds according to the 
following simplified mechanism (* indicates the active site) [66]: 
                   (R1) 
                     (R2) 
 (R3) 
N2O chemisorption first takes place on the active site of catalyst, followed by the liberation of 
dinitrogen and the deposition of oxygen on the active site (R1). The deposited oxygen may desorb as 
dioxygen via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism (R2) or Eley-Rideal mechanism (R3), with the 
regeneration of active site. 
As for N2O reduction by propane, the reductant propane may react with gaseous dioxygen from 
the decomposition of N2O or react with deposited oxygen on the active site. Considering that the 
reaction between propane and O2 leads to the formation of COx as main products (Fig. S7), the 
reaction between propane and deposited oxygen is the desired pathway for the production of 
propylene (R4). The further oxidation of propylene and the reaction between propane and dioxygen 
(R5) are the side reactions to be avoided. 
         (R4) 
          (R5) 
Obviously, the properties of the deposited oxygen play a key role for N2O-mediated ODHP. Two

types of oxygen species have been identified for N2O activation over Fe-zeolite: highly-active 
so-called α-O and thermal-stable mono-oxygen [16, 67]. The α-O is known to be excellent oxidant 
for oxygen addition reaction instead of hydrogen abstraction reaction [25]. In the present study, the 
reaction stoichiometry of N2O/C3H8 ≈ 1 and the high propylene selectivity of > 85% below 648 K 
(Fig. 6) indicate that the thermal-stable mono-oxygen is highly selective for dehydrogenation 
reaction. The further reaction between propylene and thermal-stable mono-oxygen, even if might 
exist, could be ignored. 
The properties of oxygen species deposited on the surface of Fe-MFI are greatly dependent on the 
specific iron sites. Since only exposed iron sites can be utilized during catalytic reaction, FTIR 
spectra of NO adsorption are employed to titrate the exposed iron sites. The results presented in Fig. 
5 reveal the transformation of exposed active iron sites in Fe-MFI upon high temperature calcination, 
i.e. from isolated ions or oligonuclear clusters in the straight channels of ZSM-5 to extra-framework 
Fe-O-Al species. Meanwhile, the catalytic performances in Fig. 6 clearly indicate the enhancement in 
the propylene selectivity in N2O-mediated propane dehydrogenation upon high temperature 
calcination. Based on the correlation between the exposed active iron sites in Fe-MFI characterized 
by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption (Fig. 5) and the dehydrogenation performance (Fig. 6), it is 
rational to say that extra-framework Fe-O-Al species be preferred active species for N2O-mediated 
propane hydrogenation. Particularly for Fe-MFI-24G-1073 and Fe-MFI-24G-1173, extra-framework 
Fe-O-Al species is detected as exclusively active iron site for N2O-mediated propane hydrogenation. 
The single constitution of iron site may greatly simplify the mechanism study not only for 
N2O-mediated propane hydrogenation, but also for other N2O-involved reactions on these model 
catalysts.

5. Conclusion 
Extra-framework iron species can be introduced to zeolites hosts via organometallic chemistry 
grafting route, i.e. the surface reaction between ferrocene and Brønsted acid sites in zeolites. After 
removing the organic ligands through calcinations, the iron-zeolites exhibit certain activities in 
N2O-mediated ODHP to propylene. The framework structures show decisive effects on the catalytic 
activity and MFI appears to most suitable zeolite host of iron species. Besides, calcination 
temperatures show distinct impacts on the catalytic activity of Fe-MFI in N2O-mediated ODHP. The 
highest initial propylene yield of ca. 30 %, with propane conversion of 46 % and propylene 
selectivity of 65 %, can be obtained on Fe-MFI-24G-1073 at a reaction temperature of 748 K (after 
time-on-stream of 15 min). In addition to the high activity of as-prepared Fe-MFI in N2O-mediated 
ODHP, the organometallic chemistry grafting route shows great advantage over other preparation 
routes due to its excellent reproducibility. 
Isolated ferric ions and oligonuclear clusters are detected as major iron species in Fe-MFI after the 
surface reaction between ferrocene and Brønsted acid sites in MFI and subsequent calcinations. 
High-temperature calcinations result in the obvious dealumination in MFI framework and severe loss 
of iron species, accompanied by the transformation of iron species. More important, exposed active 
iron sites in Fe-MFI transform from isolated ions or oligonuclear clusters to extra-framework 
Fe-O-Al species upon high-temperature calcinations. Based on the correlation between exposed 
active iron sites in Fe-MFI and the catalytic activities, extra-framework Fe-O-Al species are 
established to be preferred active species for N2O-mediated ODHP and mono-oxygen from the 
activation of N2O on extra-framework Fe-O-Al species are proposed to be key oxygen species for
