Abstract
The performance of differently prepared Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene has
been investigated at 723 K using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line GC analysis. Catalysts were prepared
by hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination and steam treatment, liquid-ion exchange, and chemical vapor deposition, and contain
molar Fe/Al ratios in the range of 0.26–1. Propylene yields in the range of 22–25% were attained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, much
higher over the iron zeolites prepared by post-synthesis methods (9–16%), with propylene selectivities around 40%. The deactivation
behaviour due to coking differs among the catalysts investigated. Calcined H-ZSM-5 with impurities of iron (Fe/Al = 0.007) leads to an initial
yield of propylene of 8%, and is increased to 16% upon steam treatment, obtaining a selectivity to propylene of 90%. The turnover frequency
for propylene production is up to three orders of magnitude higher in steamed H-ZSM-5 than in the synthesized iron zeolites. Our results
suggest that traces of well-isolated (mononuclear) Fe species released from framework positions by steaming are extremely active in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to
COx.

1. Introduction
Much research effort is currently devoted to the selective
activation and functionalization of light alkanes (methane,
ethane, propane, and butane) for obtaining petrochemicals
directly or their respective oleﬁnic feedstocks. Many studies
have explored the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane (ODHP) to propylene, a key building block in the
petrochemical industry. Relatively complex multimetallic
mixed oxides based on Vand Mo are considered as the most
efﬁcient catalysts in this reaction, with propene yields in the
range of 10–30% using O2 as the oxidant [1]. As recently
reported by three independent research groups [2–5], a
promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the
application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading
to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower
operation temperature (643–773 K) in comparison with the
mixed metal oxides (823–923 K). Nowin

in the range of 20–25% over Fe-ZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and
Fe-beta zeolites (0.7 wt.% Fe) prepared by hydrothermal
synthesis and subsequent steam treatment. Propylene yields
up to 25% were reported by Bula
´nek et al. [5] over steamed
Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites with signiﬁcantly lower iron loadings
(0.03–0.12 wt.% Fe). In the above studies, the degree of
propane conversion ranges from 20% to 65% at propylene

selectivities of 30–80%. The applied experimental condi-
tions in [2–5] markedly differ with respect to temperature,
feed composition, space velocity, and total pressure, so that a
proper comparison between the various catalysts cannot be
established. Besides, iron zeolites strongly deactivate during
ODHP with N2O due to coke formation and it is unclear
from these publications whether activities have been
reported at a similar degree of deactivation and/or the same
reaction time.
Attending to the notable performance of iron zeolites in
the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, the
inﬂuence of the preparation method of Fe-ZSM-5 should
be further analysed as a basis for a continued catalyst
development and optimization. It is well known that the
preparation procedure of iron zeolites strongly inﬂuences
the nature and distribution of iron species in the ﬁnal
material and the associated catalytic performance in various
reactions [6–10]. The present work was undertaken to
investigate the initial activity and deactivation behaviour of
several Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in OHDP with N2O, covering a
wide range of molar Fe/Al ratios (0.007–1). To this end, a
tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled
to on-line analysis of products has been applied for
simultaneous measurements of activity and coke formation.
Relevant conclusions on the impact of the preparation
method of Fe-ZSM-5 and the presence of iron impurities in
the zeolites on the catalytic performance have been derived.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
The chemical composition of the various zeolites
investigated in this study, as determined by ICP-OES, is
shown in Table 1. A detailed description of the preparation
methods and characterization of the iron forms in the
samples was given elsewhere [11]. Brieﬂy, steam-activated
iron zeolite (st-Fe-Z) was prepared by hydrothermal
synthesis followed by calcination at 823 K for 10 h and
steam treatment in 30 vol.% H2O in N2 at 873 K for 5 h. The
lie-Fe-Z sample was prepared by liquid-ion exchange of
NH4-ZSM-5 (P&Q, Si/Al = 37.5) at room temperature with
an aqueous solution of Fe(NO3)39H2O. The ion-exchanged
sample was thoroughly washed with water, dried, and ﬁnally
calcined in static air at 823 K for 5 h. Chemical vapor
deposition of FeCl3 onto H-ZSM-5 (Degussa, Si/Al = 15)
followed by hydrolysis and calcination at 773 K was applied
to obtain cvd-Fe-Z, according to the method described by
Chen and Sachtler [6]. The performance of the parent
NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite used in the preparation of lie-Fe-Z was
evaluated
after
calcination
and
steam
treatments
as
described for st-Fe-Z, yielding c-H-Z and st-H-Z, respec-
tively.
2.2. Reaction and coking studies
Reaction and coke deactivation studies were carried out
in a Rupprecht & Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse mass
analyser coupled to on-line gas chromatography. The TEOM
(tapered element oscillating microbalance) consists of a
microreactor (4 mm i.d.) with a high-resolution micro-
balance that generates real-time measurements of mass
changes during gas–solid reactions. The TEOM micro-
balance measures mass changes based on inertial forces,
presenting key advantages over conventional gravimetric
microbalances for adsorption, diffusion, and reaction studies
[4,12,13].
In the experiments, the TEOM microreactor was loaded
with 30 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 125–200 mm), ﬁrmly
packed between two plugs of quartz wool. Prior to
experiments the catalysts were pretreated in ﬂowing He at
the reaction temperature for 2 h. When stable baseline was
reached, He was replaced by the reaction mixture, and mass
changes and product gases were continuously monitored.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O was
carried out at 723 K in a mixture of 100 mbar C3H8 and
100 mbar N2O in He at a total pressure of 2 bar and a weight-
hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 400,000 ml h1 g1
cat. The
coke content (Ccoke, wt.%) was determined from the total
mass uptake measured by the TEOM during reaction,
accounting for the mass change caused by the change of gas
density in the tapered element when He was replaced by the
reaction mixture. The product gases were analysed by an on-
line micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with a TCD,
using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns. The conver-
sions of N2O and C3H8 were determined from the amounts
of N2 formed and C3H8 disappeared, respectively. Propene
yield and selectivity were calculated as Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/
C(C3H8) and S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8), respectively,
where C(C3H6) is the outlet concentration of propylene at

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characteristics of the zeolites
As shown in Table 1, the various zeolites investigated
here were obtained by application of different preparation
methods (hydrothermal synthesis, liquid-ion exchange, and
chemical vapor deposition) and treatments (calcination and
steaming) and the iron loadings cover a wide range of molar
Fe/Al ratios from 0.007 in st-H-Z to 1 in cvd-Fe-Z. The
presence of iron impurities in the commercial zeolite
(170 ppm Fe) contrasts with the 40, 80, and 300 times higher
iron contents in st-Fe-Z, lie-Fe-Z, and cvd-Fe-Z, respec-
tively. The synthesized and commercial zeolites in this study
typically consist of aggregated crystals, with particles
<1 mm.
A detailed investigation of the Fe forms of in the
synthesized iron zeolites was reported recently [11]. These
samples
are
characterized
by
a
heterogeneous
iron
constitution, where isolated iron ions and oligonuclear iron
clusters in the zeolite pores coexist with bulky iron oxide at
the external surface of the zeolite crystal. The distribution of
the various iron species strongly differs among the samples,
and large iron oxide particles prevail in the post-synthesized
zeolites (particularly in lie-Fe-Z). Characterization of traces
of iron in the commercial zeolites by application of
conventional techniques is a very challenging task. Although
the genesis of the commercial NH4-ZSM-5 sample is not
known in detail, it can be expected that most of the iron
impurities in c-H-Z occupy framework positions. Steam
treatment to yield st-H-Z induces an extensive extraction of
framework iron, generating highly dispersed mononuclear
iron sites in extralattice positions [14,15]. The very low Fe
concentration in the zeolite largely prevents clustering of
iron species [5,16].
The acidity of the various zeolites also differs. Steam
treatment of the hydrothermally synthesized and commer-
cial zeolites markedly decreases the number of Brønsted
acid sites due to the dislodgement of framework iron and
partial dealumination of the sample by hydrolysis of
Si–O(H)–M (M = Al, Fe) bonds [15]. Since sublimation
of FeCl3 onto H-ZSM-5 leads to a catalyst with a Fe/Al = 1,
Brønsted acidity should be absent in this sample. However,
formation of considerable amounts of iron oxide particles in
the sample [11] excludes that all the iron occupies ion-
exchange positions. The amount of Brønsted site in lie-Fe-Z
should be considerably higher attending to the lower Fe/Al
ratio. The inﬂuence of the iron content on the ODHP
performance of the zeolites can be properly investigated by
comparing c-H-Z and lie-Fe-Z, as well as st-H-Z and st-Fe-
Z, since the Si/Al ratio in these two sets of samples is
very similar.
3.2. Initial ODHP performance
Fig. 1 shows the N2O and C3H8 conversions, the C3H6
selectivity, and the C3H6 yield of the zeolites in ODHP with
N2O at 723 K. These data were determined after 2 min on
stream and is hereafter referred to as the initial activity. A
marked inﬂuence of the zeolite preparation and activation
approaches on the catalytic performance is clearly evidenced.
The propane conversion over the synthesized iron zeolites
ranges from 25% to 50%, with selectivities to propylene
around 40%. The N2O conversion over these samples was
almost complete. The highest propylene yield was obtained
over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 (22%), followed by the iron
zeolites prepared by liquid-ion exchange (16%) and chemical
vapor deposition (9%). The calcined commercial zeolite
induces low N2O and C3H8 conversions (20% and 10%,
respectively) at a propylene selectivity of 71%. The propylene
yield over c-H-Z was the lowest among the samples
investigated (7%), but surprisingly approaches that obtained
over the iron-rich cvd-Fe-Z. The ODHP performance of the
commercial sample drastically improves after steam treat-

ment of c-H-Z. The N2O and C3H8 conversions (35% and
20%, respectively) over st-H-Z are relatively low compared to
the synthesized iron zeolites, but a propylene selectivity of
90% isobtained. This leadsto a remarkable propyleneyieldof
17%, i.e. higher than over the iron zeolites prepared by post-
synthesis methods. The positive effect of steaming on the
catalytic performance of iron zeolites for different conver-
sions involving N2O, including direct decomposition [15],
benzene hydroxylation [14,16,17], and propane oxidation
[4,5] has been previously reported.
3.3. Time-on-stream performance
Fig. 2 shows the yield of propylene and the coke content
versus time-on-stream during the N2O-mediated ODHP, as
derived from the TEOM experiments and coupled gas
chromatographic analysis. The associated conversions of
nitrous oxide and propane are presented in Fig. 3. In general,
the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the
zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which
leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the
active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or
causing pore blockage. An excellent correlation has been
obtained between decrease of propylene yield and the
increase of coke content (Fig. 2). Accordingly, coke deposits
likely originate from condensation of propylene, the main
oleﬁn formed in all the catalysts investigated.
Apart from C3H6 other quantiﬁed reaction products
were COx (from total oxidation), as well as minor amounts
C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 (from cracking processes). The
concentration of ethylene formed was 15 times lower than
that of propylene. Previous studies over st-Fe-Z have
identiﬁed also oxygenates, including propionaldehyde and
small amounts of acrolein and acetone [3], and traces of
alcohols and aromatics were also reported by Bula
´nek et al.
[5], using conventional gas chromatography. The duration
of each analysis in these studies was at least of 15 min and
up to 100 min. The micro-GC used in this study enables
separation of propane and propylene in 2 min. For many
catalysts, the time scale for deactivation by coking is
signiﬁcantly shorter than the above analysis times, e.g.
10 min over lie-Fe-Z in Fig. 2. Therefore, fast analysis of
the reactant (propane) and desired product (propylene) is
essential to precisely follow catalyst deactivation and
compare intrinsic catalytic performances of the various
zeolites at Ccoke ! 0, at the expenses of not having a
complete analysis of reaction products.
The time and degree of deactivation in Fig. 2 depend
on the catalyst in question. Since propylene is the main
coke precursor, the amount of coke formed should be
indicative of the catalyst activity towards propylene
production, while the catalysts in which propene produc-
tion is lower should form less coke, and deactivate to a
lesser extent relatively. In good agreement, the coke
content after 400 min on stream over st-Fe-Z (21 wt.%)
was ca. two and ﬁve times higher that over lie-Fe-Z
(11 wt.%) and cvd-Fe-Z (5 wt.%), respectively. The st-Fe-

is maintained during 75 min. This is related with the less
pronounced slope of the coking proﬁle of this sample as
compared to the more rapid deactivation and steep coking
proﬁle in lie-Fe-Z. The propylene yield of st-Fe-Z after
400 min on stream (10%) is very similar to the initial
propylene yield obtained over the zeolites prepared by
post-synthesis methods, further evidencing the superior
ODHP
performance
of
st-Fe-Z.
The
relatively
fast
deactivation of lie-Fe-Z can be attributed to the presence
of a relatively high number of Brønsted acid sites in the
sample. It is well-known that coking is favored over acidic
protonic sites in the zeolites, which catalyze formation
of carbenium ions from propylene that end up in the
formation of carbonaceous deposits.
The N2O conversion over cvd-Fe-Z and lie-Fe-Z after
400 min on stream remains at relatively high values (100%
and 65%, respectively), in comparison with st-Fe-Z (25%).
In the latter, both N2O and C3H8 conversions follow the
same trend. Comparison of results in Figs. 2 and 3 enables to
state that the catalysts with high residual N2O conversions
lead to low residual propylene yields (ca. 2% in cvd-Fe-Z
and lie-Fe-Z versus 10% in st-Fe-Z). Since the residual
propane conversions were similar in the three synthesized
iron zeolites (10–15%), a high N2O conversion is associated
with a poor C3H6 selectivity, leading mainly to COx. The
propylene selectivity at 400 min was of ca. 15% in cvd-Fe-Z
and lie-Fe-Z, in contrast with values of ca. 90% in st-Fe-Z.
The samples prepared by liquid-ion exchange and chemical
vapor deposition contain high iron loadings and a marked
contribution of large iron oxide particles, where the total
combustion of reaction intermediates leading to the oleﬁn
appears to be favored.
The coking proﬁles of the calcined and steamed
commercial zeolites are very similar, leading to a ﬁnal
coke amount of ca. 5% (Fig. 2). Both zeolites present
deactivation, but considerably less pronounced compared to
equivalent zeolites containing higher iron loadings. The
propylene yield is signiﬁcantly higher in st-H-Z than in
c-H-Z, although the propane conversion over both samples
is rather similar (especially after 40 min on stream). This
indicates that steaming mainly leads to a more selective
catalyst towards propylene. A somewhat higher conversion
of the oxidant was also achieved over st-H-Z with respect to
c-H-Z.
The C3H8 and N2O conversions over st-H-Z are much
lower than over st-Fe-Z, and the same observation holds
true when comparing c-H-Z and lie-Fe-Z. These two
sets of samples contain a similar Si/Al ratio and were
treated identically (steaming for st-H-Z and st-Fe-Z and
calcinations for c-H-Z and lie-Fe-Z), and evidence the
beneﬁcial effect of iron in terms of absolute conversions
and yields. However, the residual propylene yield in both
st-H-Z and st-Fe-Z was very similar (ca. 10%), and that
of c-H-Z is even higher than in lie-Fe-Z (5% vs. 3%).
This striking result strongly suggests that an extremely
low number of iron sites is responsible of the observed
performance. Thus, iron impurities in the commercial
zeolite display an exceptionally high activity for N2O-
mediated
oxidative
dehydrogenation
of
propane
to
propylene.

3.4. Turnover frequency for propylene production
Fig. 4 shows the TOF (turnover frequency) for propylene
production in logarithmic scale vs. the molar Fe/Al ratio in
the samples. The TOF is deﬁned as the mole of propylene
per hour per mole of iron in the catalyst. Values at reaction
times of 2 and 400 min are displayed in the ﬁgure. The TOF
decreases by three orders of magnitude when the Fe/Al ratio
is increased from 0.007 in the nominal iron-free st-H-Z to 1
in cvd-Fe-Z. The decrease in TOF is steepest at molar Fe/Al
ratios <0.5. This result further emphasizes the severe Fe-
underutilization in the synthesized iron zeolites and that iron
impurities in H-ZSM-5 play a decisive role in the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane (OHDP) with N2O. Based on
Fig. 4, the activity of c-H-Z for C3H6 formation is 2–3 times
lower than over st-H-Z as a consequence of the positive
effect of steaming, expelling framework iron to active
extraframework positions. Noteworthily the calcined com-
mercial zeolite ﬁts well in the correlation of Fig. 4, yielding
one, two, and three orders of magnitude higher TOFs than
st-Fe-Z, lie-Fe-Z, and cvd-Fe-Z, respectively.
The vital role of iron impurities in the catalytic
performance of H-ZSM-5 for the oxidation of benzene to
phenol (BTOP) with N2O has been extensively examined in
the literature, originally by the group of Panov [17], and more
recently in excellent works of Kuba
´nek et al. [16] and Jia
et al. [14]. The latter authors reported a correlation between
the hydroxylation activity and concentration of iron in dif-
ferently prepared Fe-ZSM-5 with Fe/Al = 0.014–1.2, greatly
resembling that obtained here for ODHP. From this important
observation, one could expect the same dependence for other
N2O-mediated selective oxidations over iron zeolites.
The eventual universality of the correlation here and in
[14], where a strong increase of the turnover frequency for
phenol and propylene production with decreasing Fe
loading, can be associated with a model where isolated
iron species play an essential role in the performance. Steam
treatment of H-ZSM-5 containing a small Fe impurity is
known to generate highly dispersed isolated species in the
zeolite micropores [14,15]. This is a consequence of the high
dilution of iron in the matrix, which prevents occurrence of
clustering. This result has been interpreted that mononuclear
iron sites are crucial for the benzene oxidation to phenol
[14,16], being the basis for DFT calculations of the reaction
over this type of sites [18]. This reasoning can be
extrapolated to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,
as also explains the high propylene yields obtained by
Bula
´nek et al. [5] over Fe-ZSM-5 with iron concentrations of
300–1200 ppm.
Previous studies have shown the higher absolute activity
of cvd-Fe-Z in direct N2O decomposition as compared to
st-Fe-Z and lie-Fe-Z [8,9]. In this reaction, steam-activated
H-ZSM-5 showed poor activities [15]. It has been concluded
that a certain degree of iron clustering is required to obtain
highly active catalysts for N2O decomposition [15,19,20].
This differs from ODHP, further evincing the sensitivity of
the speciﬁc catalytic process and its intrinsic mechanism to
the form(s) of active iron [20]. Jia et al. [14] have also
reﬂected on this aspect, leading to similar conclusion for
other reactions: high iron loadings are required for NOx
reduction to N2 with hydrocarbons and low iron loadings
for the benzene oxidation to phenol with N2O. In fact,
comparison of the performance of st-Fe-Z and st-H-Z can be
used to illustrate that the presence of higher iron amounts in

st-Fe-Z is beneﬁcial for achieving high propane conversion
and propylene yields, but on the contrary signiﬁcantly lower
propylene selectivity is obtained. For both ODHP and BTOP,
the occurrence of iron association in the form of large
clusters should be minimized to obtain a selective catalyst
due to the total oxidation of important intermediates leading
to the desired product over iron oxide. Suppressing
clustering is a very challenging task over samples containing
iron in concentrations higher than the hundreds of ppm in
commercial specimens. From a practical perspective, the
application of st-H-Z in ODHP (and likely in BTOP) is
more conceivable than that of st-Fe-Z. This is motivated by
the higher C3H6 selectivity and better utilization of the
expensive N2O oxidant over st-H-Z. Furthermore, a major
reduction in catalyst production cost is expected by
application of a commercial sample.
The current work has not speciﬁcally touched upon the
role of acidity on the ODHP reaction, which may be
important not only for the initial performance but also to
understand
and
minimize
catalyst
deactivation.
Our
results show that deactivation is slower over the steam-
activated zeolites (Fig. 2), with a signiﬁcantly reduced
number of Brønsted sites as a consequence of the steam
treatment [21]. A high number of protonic acid sites
should catalyze coke formation, thus accelerating the
zeolite deactivation, as suggested from the results over lie-
Fe-Z. It is likely that the presence of a certain amount of
acidic groups coexisting with extraframework iron species
is beneﬁcial for the reaction. Notte
´ [22] concluded that the
presence of Brønsted acid sites is essential for benzene-to-
phenol hydroxylation together with certain iron species
(a-sites). He showed that a decrease in the number of
Brønsted sites after steaming a zeolite increased both the
concentration of the active a-sites and the phenol yield.
After reaching an optimum concentration on Brønsted
sites, further reduction of their number was accompanied
by a decrease in the zeolite activity. Further research is
required to elucidate the role of acidity in ODHP. To this
end, zeolite samples with the same amount and constitu-
tion of iron and different concentrations of Brønsted acid
sites (varying the framework Si/Al ratio) would be ideally
required. What is clear from the high ODHP activity of
the Al-free steamed Fe-silicalite [3,4] is that extraframe-
work aluminum species generated upon steaming are not
relevant in the reaction. This has also been concluded for
direct N2O decomposition [15] and benzene hydroxyla-
tion to phenol [14,16,17,22].
4. Conclusions
The method of incorporation of iron in ZSM-5 zeolites
plays an essential role on the performance for propylene
production via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(ODHP) with N2O. Activation in steam of the isomor-
phously substituted iron zeolite leads to superior propylene
yields as compared to iron zeolites prepared by post-
synthesis methods (liquid-ion exchange and chemical vapor
deposition). Iron impurities in steamed commercial H-ZSM-
5 induce relatively low conversions of propene and N2O,
but leads to a propylene selectivity of 90% and thus to very
low COx formation. A correlation between the turnover
frequency (TOF) for
propane
oxydehydrogenation
to
propylene and the Fe/Al ratio in the zeolites has been
obtained. The turnover is highest for steamed H-ZSM-5 (Fe/
Al = 0.007), decreasing by three orders of magnitude in the
catalyst prepared by chemical vapor deposition (Fe/Al = 1).
Our results indicate the extraordinary quality of iron traces
in the commercial zeolite sample for the ODHP reaction
particularly after steam treatment. The isolated nature of the
iron species in this sample can be envisaged in view of the
high dilution of iron in the zeolite matrix. This lends
credence to the model where mononuclear Fe sites are vital
for propylene production via ODHP, in good agreement
with the N2O-mediated oxidation of benzene to phenol
over iron zeolites. Association of iron species into large
clusters, typically observed in synthesized iron zeolites
enhances deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates
leading to COx.
