[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has shown significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O results in increased propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites, vanadium-based catalysts, and molybdenum-based catalysts.

The improved selectivity is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to oxidize reduced catalyst species, particularly in the case of vanadium oxide catalysts. This property allows for a more controlled oxidation process, leading to higher propylene yields and reduced overoxidation to undesired products.

Several types of catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP:

1. Iron-based materials: Fe-ZSM-5 has been found to give the highest propylene yield.
2. Vanadium-based catalysts: These show significantly improved selectivity with N2O compared to oxygen.
3. Molybdenum-based catalysts: These also demonstrate increased propylene selectivity when N2O is used.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is rapid catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation. Both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts have been reported to deactivate within several hours on stream. This issue makes N2O currently less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more practically viable, several strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved resistance to coking, possibly through the incorporation of coke-resistant materials or novel support structures.

2. Mechanistic studies: Conduct in-depth investigations into the deactivation mechanisms, particularly for molybdenum oxide catalysts, to gain a clearer understanding of the process.

3. Regeneration techniques: Explore efficient methods for in-situ catalyst regeneration to extend catalyst lifetime and maintain activity.

4. Process optimization: Investigate optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) that balance high propylene selectivity with reduced coke formation.

5. Catalyst promoters: Study the effects of various promoters that could enhance catalyst stability without compromising selectivity.

6. Novel reactor designs: Develop reactor configurations that minimize coke formation or allow for continuous catalyst regeneration.

7. Hybrid processes: Explore the potential of combining N2O-ODHP with other technologies to mitigate the drawbacks while maintaining the selectivity advantages.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, it may be possible to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop a more feasible and efficient process for propylene production.

与其他氧化剂相比，一氧化二氮（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中作为氧化剂显示出显著的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。N2O的使用导致各种催化剂的丙烯选择性提高，包括含铁沸石、钒基催化剂和钼基催化剂。

这种选择性的提高归因于N2O较弱的氧化还原催化剂物种的能力，特别是在钒氧化物催化剂的情况下。这一特性允许更受控的氧化过程，导致更高的丙烯产率和减少过度氧化为不需要的产物。

N2O-ODHP中使用了几种类型的催化剂：

1. 铁基材料：Fe-ZSM-5被发现能给出最高的丙烯产率。
2. 钒基催化剂：与氧气相比，这些催化剂在使用N2O时显示出显著提高的选择性。
3. 钼基催化剂：当使用N2O时，这些催化剂也表现出增加的丙烯选择性。

然而，N2O-ODHP的关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于积碳形成。据报道，钒基和铁基催化剂在几小时内就会失活。这个问题使得N2O目前作为氧化剂的可行性低于其他软氧化剂，如CO2。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP在实际中更加可行，可以采取以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有改进的抗积碳能力的催化剂，可能通过incorporation抗积碳材料或新型支撑结构。

2. 机理研究：对失活机理进行深入研究，特别是对钼氧化物催化剂，以更清楚地理解这个过程。

3. 再生技术：探索高效的原位催化剂再生方法，以延长催化剂寿命并保持活性。

4. 过程优化：研究平衡高丙烯选择性和减少积碳形成的最佳反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）。

5. 催化剂助剂：研究各种助剂的效果，这些助剂可以提高催化剂稳定性而不影响选择性。

6. 新型反应器设计：开发能最小化积碳形成或允许连续催化剂再生的反应器配置。

7. 混合工艺：探索将N2O-ODHP与其他技术结合的潜力，以缓解缺点同时保持选择性优势。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，可能可以克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，开发出更可行和更高效的丙烯生产工艺。
