[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen. The use of N2O results in a substantial increase in propylene selectivity for various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts.

Several catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP:

1. Iron-based materials: Fe-ZSM-5 has been found to give the highest C3H6 yield.
2. Vanadium-based catalysts: These show improved C3H6 selectivity with N2O compared to O2.
3. Molybdenum-based catalysts: These also exhibit increased C3H6 selectivity when N2O is added during C3H8 dehydrogenation.

The improved propylene selectivity with N2O is attributed to its lesser ability to oxidize reduced catalyst species, particularly in the case of vanadium oxide catalysts.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is rapid catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation. This issue makes N2O currently less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2. Both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts have been reported to deactivate within several hours on stream.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Develop more stable catalysts resistant to coke formation.
2. Investigate and understand the deactivation mechanisms in depth.
3. Explore novel catalyst compositions or structures that can maintain high selectivity while improving stability.
4. Study the effects of catalyst supports and loading to optimize performance and stability.
5. Investigate methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts efficiently.
6. Explore the use of promoters or dopants to enhance catalyst stability.
7. Develop in-situ techniques to monitor and mitigate coke formation during the reaction.
8. Optimize reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, gas composition) to balance selectivity and catalyst stability.
9. Investigate the potential of catalyst regeneration cycles to extend overall catalyst lifetime.
10. Explore the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve a balance between selectivity and stability.

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop more practical and efficient processes for propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。N2O的使用导致多种催化剂的丙烯选择性显著提高，包括含铁沸石和钒基催化剂。

N2O-ODHP中使用了几种催化剂：

1. 铁基材料：Fe-ZSM-5被发现具有最高的C3H6产率。
2. 钒基催化剂：与O2相比，这些催化剂在使用N2O时表现出更好的C3H6选择性。
3. 钼基催化剂：在C3H8脱氢过程中添加N2O时，这些催化剂也表现出更高的C3H6选择性。

N2O改善丙烯选择性的原因被归因于其较弱的氧化还原催化剂物种的能力，特别是在钒氧化物催化剂的情况下。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是催化剂快速失活，主要是由于积碳形成。这个问题使得N2O目前作为氧化剂的可行性低于其他软氧化剂，如CO2。据报道，钒基和铁基催化剂在反应几小时内就会失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 开发更稳定的、耐积碳的催化剂。
2. 深入研究和了解失活机理。
3. 探索新型催化剂组成或结构，在保持高选择性的同时提高稳定性。
4. 研究催化剂载体和负载量的影响，以优化性能和稳定性。
5. 研究高效再生失活催化剂的方法。
6. 探索使用助剂或掺杂剂来增强催化剂稳定性。
7. 开发原位技术，以监测和减少反应过程中的积碳形成。
8. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、气体组成），以平衡选择性和催化剂稳定性。
9. 研究催化剂再生循环的潜力，以延长整体催化剂寿命。
10. 探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以在选择性和稳定性之间取得平衡。

通过专注于这些领域，研究人员可能能够克服N2O-ODHP的当前限制，开发出更实用、更高效的丙烯生产工艺。
