[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen."

[8] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen. The use of N2O results in a substantial increase in propylene selectivity for various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts.

The main advantage of using N2O is its ability to maintain high propylene selectivity while reducing the formation of unwanted overoxidation products. This is attributed to N2O's lesser ability to oxidize reduced catalyst species, leading to a more controlled oxidation process.

Several catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP:

1. Iron-based materials: Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites have shown the highest C3H6 yield.
2. Vanadium-based catalysts: VOx supported on various materials (γ-Al2O3, SiO2, MCM-41) have demonstrated improved selectivity with N2O.
3. Molybdenum-based catalysts: NiMoO4 and mixed oxides have shown increased C3H6 selectivity with N2O addition.

Despite the improved selectivity, N2O-ODHP faces critical challenges:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Most N2O-ODHP catalysts deactivate quickly, primarily due to coke formation.
2. Stability issues: The rapid deactivation makes N2O currently less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation and enhanced stability under N2O-ODHP conditions.
2. Mechanistic studies: Conduct in-depth investigations into the deactivation mechanisms to better understand and mitigate the stability issues.
3. Support optimization: Explore different support materials and their impact on catalyst performance and stability.
4. Process engineering: Investigate reactor designs and operating conditions that minimize catalyst deactivation and promote regeneration.
5. Promoter addition: Study the effects of adding promoters to existing catalysts to enhance their stability and selectivity.
6. Hybrid systems: Explore the potential of combining N2O with other oxidants or using it in multi-step processes to leverage its selectivity benefits while mitigating stability issues.

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop more practical and efficient processes for propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有显著优势，尤其是与氧气相比。使用N2O可以显著提高多种催化剂的丙烯选择性，包括含铁沸石和钒基催化剂。

使用N2O的主要优势在于它能够保持高丙烯选择性，同时减少不需要的过度氧化产物的形成。这归因于N2O氧化还原态催化剂物种的能力较弱，从而导致更可控的氧化过程。

N2O-ODHP中使用了几种催化剂：

1. 铁基材料：Fe-ZSM-5沸石显示出最高的C3H6产率。
2. 钒基催化剂：负载在各种材料上的VOx（γ-Al2O3、SiO2、MCM-41）在使用N2O时表现出改善的选择性。
3. 钼基催化剂：NiMoO4和混合氧化物在添加N2O时显示出增加的C3H6选择性。

尽管选择性有所提高，N2O-ODHP仍面临关键挑战：

1. 催化剂失活：大多数N2O-ODHP催化剂快速失活，主要是由于积碳形成。
2. 稳定性问题：快速失活使N2O目前作为氧化剂的可行性低于其他软氧化剂（如CO2）。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发在N2O-ODHP条件下具有改善的抗积碳能力和增强稳定性的催化剂。
2. 机理研究：对失活机理进行深入研究，以更好地理解和缓解稳定性问题。
3. 载体优化：探索不同载体材料及其对催化剂性能和稳定性的影响。
4. 过程工程：研究能够最小化催化剂失活并促进再生的反应器设计和操作条件。
5. 助剂添加：研究向现有催化剂添加助剂以增强其稳定性和选择性的效果。
6. 混合系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用或在多步骤过程中使用的潜力，以利用其选择性优势，同时缓解稳定性问题。

通过关注这些领域，研究人员可能能够克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，并开发出更实用、更高效的丙烯生产工艺。
