4. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Nitrous Oxide
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Another milder oxidant that is favored to reduce formation of unwanted overoxidation is nitrous oxide (N2O). Using N2O as an oxidant may be an effective way to utilize N2O, which is an acidic, strong greenhouse gas. Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts. (20,177181) While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well. (179,182185) However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2. (180184,186,187) While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream. Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O.
4.1. Metal Oxide Catalysts
4.1.1. Vanadium Oxides
In general, for vanadium catalysts, using N2O instead of O2 in ODHP results in increased selectivity of C3H6. (20,177,186189) For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3. (188) Also, Dingerdissen et al. show that C3H6 selectivity of up to 90% can be obtained with a V2O5 catalyst when using N2O as an oxidant, while the highest selectivity obtained using O2 as the oxidant is 78%. (186) Furthermore, while selectivity tends to decrease as C3H8 conversion increases, this effect is much less pronounced when N2O is used as the oxidant. (179,186,189) As reported by Kondratenko et al., when O2 is used for ODHP, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 75% to 50% is observed as C3H8 conversion increases from 2% to 10% using a 2.8% VOx/SiO2 catalyst. (186) In contrast, when N2O is used, a less significant decrease in selectivity is observed, falling from 93% to 81%, for a similar change in C3H8 conversion.
Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species. It is observed in numerous reports that VOx species tend to be in a more oxidized state when exposed to O2 than N2O. (20,186,188,189) UVvis measurements of a 9.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in different gas mixtures, as shown in Figure 14, are one example that supports such a notion. (188) The intensity of the two bands at 230 and 300 nm, indicating the presence of V5+ species, decreases substantially when C3H8 oxidation is performed with N2O rather than O2. This indicates that more V5+ cations are reduced when C3H8 oxidation is performed with N2O than O2. Similarly, as shown in Table 8, XPS analysis of V2O5, VO2, and V2O3 catalysts after O2ODHP also indicates that VOx species are much more reduced in N2O than in O2. (186) Interestingly, as shown in Table 9, C3H6 selectivity tends to be higher as the VOx species are more reduced. From such observations, it is proposed that C3H6 selectivity is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity.

Regarding the vanadium oxide species that are formed in ODHP using O2 and N2O, Sauer et al. propose that the formation of peroxovanadate species can be responsible for the decreased selectivity to C3H6 when using O2. (177) In their DFT analysis, it was reported that formation of peroxovanadate species is much more favored in O2, while the formation of vanadyl oxygen species is more favored under N2O. On the basis of this observation, Sauer et al. assert that the peroxovanadate site leads to consecutive C3H6 oxidation, while such a phenomena is more limited on the vanadyl oxygen site, leading to higher selectivity of C3H6 during ODHP. (177) More detailed discussion regarding progress in theoretical studies is covered in section 6.2. In the analysis of ODHP on a VOx/MCM-41 catalyst using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Bruckner et al. state that higher activity and lower selectivity toward C3H8 with O2 than N2O are attributed to the formation of highly reactive electrophilic O species under O2, while nucleophilic, less active O2 ions serve as reactants under N2O. (20) Their results indicate that electrophilic Vn+···O· (n = 4 or 5) species form when the catalyst is pretreated with O2, likely through the dissociation of adsorbed oxygen species. However, such species are not observed after treatment with N2O, likely due to rapid formation of O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active. Combining previous DFT results with their observation from EPR, Kondratenko et al. propose that high activity and low selectivity of C3H6 in ODHP using O2 is likely due to electrophilic Vn+···O site formation, which is formed as a result of decomposition of peroxovanadate sites, OxV5+···O22, as summarized in Figure 15. For OxV4+ species, it is suggested that OxV5+···O2· forms upon the reoxidation to further react with another OxV4+ or OxV3+ to yield a Vn+···O· site. Meanwhile for ODHP using N2O, only less active O2 ions are formed through decomposition of N2O on OxV3+ sites. DFT results have showed that the reoxidation of OxV4+ species is not favored under N2O, so it is assumed only OxV3+ species can be reoxidized.
Lastly, type of support and loading of vanadium oxide have been reported as additional factors to affect catalytic activity and C3H6 selectivity. (179,189,190) Baerns et al. report that silica-supported VOx catalysts show higher C3H6 selectivity than alumina-supported catalysts, whether O2 or N2O is used as oxidant (Figure 16). It is also noted that the C3H6 selectivity increases as the loading of VOx increases, up to a certain loading on the alumina, while it barely shows any change in selectivity for the silica-supported counterpart. On the basis of such observations, it was hypothesized that C3H6 adsorption is more likely to occur on the exposed surface of the acidic γ-Al2O3 support. The adsorbed C3H6 might further transform to COx, thereby decreasing C3H6 selectivity. (190) For weakly acidic supports, like silica, adsorption of C3H6 does not occur well, so very small change in selectivity despite change in the exposed support surface area. Apart from the exposed surface area of the support, the dispersion of VOx species is another factor that has a crucial impact on the C3H6 selectivity. (179,188,189) It has been observed in multiple reports that regardless of the oxidant and support type used, above a certain VOx loading, the selectivity toward C3H6 tends to decrease. On the basis of these observations, it is reported that isolated VOx sites tend to be more selective toward C3H6, while more polymerized VOx species lead to drop in selectivity.
4.1.2. Molybdenum Oxides
Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation. (184,185,191193) For example, in their work on ODHP using a NiMoO4 catalyst, Ruiz et al. report an increase in C3H6 selectivity from 18.3% to 24.2%, along with a decrease in CO2 selectivity from 23.2% to 21.4%, occurs with a decrease in C3H8 conversion from 14.6% to 12.4% with 300 ppm of N2O in the feed gas. (184) Similar results are also evident using a mixture of NiMoO4 and α-Sb2O4 catalyst. (191) In the presence of 300 ppm of N2O, an increase in C3H6 selectivity from 34.6% to 37.5% and decrease in C3H8 conversion from 9.3% to 8.1% is observed. A decrease in CO2 selectivity from 24.2% to 22.0% is evident as well. It should be noted that 300 ppm of N2O has been co-fed with 10% O2 in all these reports.
In an effort to observe the surface species present after performing ODHP with different concentrations of N2O as a co-feed, XPS analysis has been performed on the catalysts, with the results shown in Table 10. (184) From these studies, while no Mo5+ species are present in the absence of N2O, Mo5+ species emerge after the N2O dopant is used in the ODHP reaction. On the basis of this result, it was hypothesized that the reduction of molybdenum is induced by propane due to the weaker oxidation capability of N2O. Surface sites of the NiMoO4 material are further studied by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. DRIFTS is conducted under 1% N2O, 10% N2O, and synthetic air over the NiMoO4 catalyst. As shown in Figure 17, the intensity of the band at 1000 cm1, assigned as a MoO3 vibration band ν(MoO), decreases in the order of synthetic air >10% N2O > 1% N2O. These results corroborate the prior observations from XPS.

Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen. (184,185) Furthermore, it was hypothesized that N2O limits the oxidation rate of the catalyst by adsorbing on the same vacancy that O2 would adsorb, thereby inhibiting adsorption of O2 on the surface of the catalyst. Consequently, the formation of electrophilic O or O2 species would be limited, resulting in the decrease in the secondary oxidation of C3H6 and higher C3H6 selectivity in return. The adsorbed N2O would further dissociate to O2 species (eq 4-1 and eq 4-2), which can be responsible for the improved C3H6 selectivity observed upon addition of N2O during the ODHP reaction, as O is known to lead to overoxidation products, while O2 leads to selective oxidation products. (194)

Of note, there is an optimum amount of N2O that is beneficial for elevating the C3H6 selectivity. It has been observed that, when the concentration of N2O is too high, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity is observed. On the basis of these observations, it was hypothesized that there is an optimum oxidation state for Mon+ species that allows for maximum selectivity; if the extent of reduction is too high, COx products are favored, leading to decreased C3H6 selectivity. Catalytic performances of reported metal oxide catalysts are summarized in Table 11.
