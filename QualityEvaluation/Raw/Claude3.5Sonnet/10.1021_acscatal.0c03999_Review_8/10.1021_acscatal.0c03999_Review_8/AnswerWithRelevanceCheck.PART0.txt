          [1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen."

[8] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen. This improved selectivity is observed across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites, vanadium-based catalysts, and molybdenum-based catalysts.

The main advantage of using N2O is its lesser ability to oxidize reduced catalyst species, particularly vanadium oxide (VOx) and molybdenum species. This results in a more reduced state of the catalyst surface, which is associated with higher propylene selectivity. For example, using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3 can increase propylene selectivity from 55% to 75%.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP:
1. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, which give the highest propylene yield.
2. Vanadium-based catalysts, which show significant improvements in selectivity with N2O.
3. Molybdenum-based catalysts, which also exhibit increased propylene selectivity with N2O addition.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is rapid catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation. This issue makes N2O currently less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. In-depth studies on deactivation mechanisms
2. Catalyst design for coke resistance
3. Optimizing reaction conditions
4. Exploring novel catalyst supports
5. Catalyst regeneration strategies
6. Hybrid catalysts
7. Continuous flow systems
8. Theoretical studies

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop more stable, selective, and commercially viable catalytic systems for propylene production.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比，尤其是氧气，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。这种改进的选择性在各种催化剂中都有观察到，包括含铁沸石、钒基催化剂和钼基催化剂。

使用N2O的主要优势在于它对还原态催化剂物种的氧化能力较弱，特别是对钒氧化物（VOx）和钼物种。这导致催化剂表面处于更还原的状态，与更高的丙烯选择性相关。例如，使用N2O代替O2作为0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3的氧化剂可以将丙烯选择性从55%提高到75%。

在N2O-ODHP中使用了各种催化剂：
1. 铁基材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，提供最高的丙烯产率。
2. 钒基催化剂，在使用N2O时显示出显著的选择性改善。
3. 钼基催化剂，在添加N2O时也表现出丙烯选择性的增加。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于结焦形成。这个问题使得N2O目前作为氧化剂的可行性低于其他软氧化剂，如CO2。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 深入研究失活机理
2. 设计抗结焦催化剂
3. 优化反应条件
4. 探索新型催化剂载体
5. 催化剂再生策略
6. 混合催化剂
7. 连续流系统
8. 理论研究

通过关注这些领域，研究人员可能能够克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，开发出更稳定、更具选择性和商业可行性的丙烯生产催化系统。
