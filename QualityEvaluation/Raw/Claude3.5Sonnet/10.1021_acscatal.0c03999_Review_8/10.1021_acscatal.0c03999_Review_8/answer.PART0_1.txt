[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "While an in depth study regarding the rate of deactivation or deactivation mechanism has not been reported for molybdenum oxide catalysts, both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts are reported to deactivate within several hours on stream."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Of note, there is an optimum amount of N2O that is beneficial for elevating the C3H6 selectivity. It has been observed that, when the concentration of N2O is too high, a decrease in C3H6 selectivity is observed."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen. N2O has been shown to increase propylene selectivity across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites, vanadium-based catalysts, and molybdenum-based catalysts.

The main advantage of using N2O is its lesser ability to oxidize reduced catalyst species, which leads to improved propylene selectivity. This is particularly evident in vanadium-based catalysts, where the use of N2O results in more reduced VOx species compared to when oxygen is used as the oxidant. Similarly, molybdenum catalysts show increased propylene selectivity and decreased propane conversion when N2O is added to the feed gas.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, including:
1. Iron-containing zeolites (e.g., Fe-ZSM-5)
2. Vanadium-based catalysts (e.g., VOx/γ-Al2O3, VOx/SiO2)
3. Molybdenum-based catalysts (e.g., NiMoO4, NiMoO4/α-Sb2O4)

Despite the improved propylene selectivity, N2O-ODHP faces critical challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. The main issues are:
1. Rapid deactivation of catalysts, primarily due to coke formation
2. Short on-stream lifetime, with some catalysts deactivating within several hours

These limitations currently make N2O a less feasible oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2.

To address these challenges and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Develop more coke-resistant catalysts: Focus on creating catalyst formulations that are less prone to coke formation or can better tolerate coke deposition without rapid deactivation.

2. Investigate catalyst regeneration methods: Develop efficient and cost-effective techniques to regenerate deactivated catalysts, potentially allowing for longer overall catalyst lifetimes.

3. Optimize N2O concentration: As there is an optimum amount of N2O that benefits propylene selectivity, research should focus on determining the ideal N2O concentration for different catalyst systems to maximize selectivity while minimizing deactivation.

4. Study deactivation mechanisms: Conduct in-depth studies on the deactivation mechanisms, particularly for molybdenum oxide catalysts, to better understand and mitigate the causes of rapid deactivation.

5. Explore catalyst support effects: Investigate the impact of different catalyst supports on stability and selectivity, as support materials have been shown to influence catalyst performance.

6. Develop novel catalyst designs: Explore new catalyst architectures or composite materials that can combine the selectivity benefits of N2O with improved stability.

7. Investigate process engineering solutions: Explore innovative reactor designs or process configurations that could help mitigate catalyst deactivation or allow for continuous catalyst regeneration.

By addressing these challenges through focused research and development efforts, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production, offering improved selectivity while overcoming the current limitations in catalyst stability and longevity.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。N2O已被证明可以在各种催化剂中提高丙烯选择性，包括含铁沸石、钒基催化剂和钼基催化剂。

使用N2O的主要优势在于其较弱的氧化还原催化剂物种的能力，这导致了丙烯选择性的提高。这在钒基催化剂中尤为明显，使用N2O时会产生更多还原态的VOx物种，相比之下使用氧气作为氧化剂时则不然。同样，当向进料气中添加N2O时，钼催化剂也表现出丙烯选择性增加和丙烷转化率降低的特点。

N2O-ODHP中使用了多种催化剂，包括：
1. 含铁沸石（如Fe-ZSM-5）
2. 钒基催化剂（如VOx/γ-Al2O3，VOx/SiO2）
3. 钼基催化剂（如NiMoO4，NiMoO4/α-Sb2O4）

尽管丙烯选择性得到了提高，但N2O-ODHP面临着与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。主要问题包括：
1. 催化剂快速失活，主要是由于积碳形成
2. 短的在线寿命，一些催化剂在几小时内就会失活

这些限制目前使N2O相比其他软氧化剂（如CO2）成为一种不太可行的氧化剂。

为了解决这些挑战并使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更加可行，可以采取以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 开发更耐积碳的催化剂：专注于创造不易形成积碳或能更好地耐受积碳沉积而不会快速失活的催化剂配方。

2. 研究催化剂再生方法：开发高效且经济的技术来再生失活的催化剂，可能允许更长的整体催化剂寿命。

3. 优化N2O浓度：由于存在有利于丙烯选择性的最佳N2O用量，研究应集中在确定不同催化剂系统的理想N2O浓度，以最大化选择性同时最小化失活。

4. 研究失活机理：对失活机理进行深入研究，特别是对于钼氧化物催化剂，以更好地理解和减轻快速失活的原因。

5. 探索催化剂载体效应：研究不同催化剂载体对稳定性和选择性的影响，因为载体材料已被证明会影响催化剂性能。

6. 开发新型催化剂设计：探索新的催化剂结构或复合材料，可以结合N2O的选择性优势和改进的稳定性。

7. 研究过程工程解决方案：探索创新的反应器设计或工艺配置，可以帮助减轻催化剂失活或允许连续催化剂再生。

通过针对性的研究和开发努力解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择，在提高选择性的同时克服当前催化剂稳定性和寿命的限制。
