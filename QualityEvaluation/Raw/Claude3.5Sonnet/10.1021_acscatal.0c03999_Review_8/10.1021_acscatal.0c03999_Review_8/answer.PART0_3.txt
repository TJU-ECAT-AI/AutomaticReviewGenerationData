[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "It is observed in numerous reports that VOx species tend to be in a more oxidized state when exposed to O2 than N2O."

[7] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen. This improved selectivity is observed across various catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites, vanadium-based catalysts, and molybdenum-based catalysts.

The main advantage of using N2O is its lesser ability to oxidize reduced catalyst species, particularly vanadium oxide (VOx) species. This results in a more reduced state of the catalyst surface, which is associated with higher propylene selectivity. For vanadium-based catalysts, the use of N2O instead of O2 can increase propylene selectivity from 55% to 75% or even up to 90% in some cases.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP:

1. Iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, which give the highest propylene yield.
2. Vanadium-based catalysts, which show significant improvements in selectivity with N2O.
3. Molybdenum-based catalysts, which also exhibit increased propylene selectivity with N2O addition.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is rapid catalyst deactivation, primarily due to coke formation. This issue makes N2O currently less feasible as an oxidant compared to other soft oxidants like CO2. Both vanadium- and iron-based catalysts have been reported to deactivate within several hours on stream.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. In-depth studies on deactivation mechanisms: A clear understanding of how and why catalysts deactivate is crucial for developing more stable catalysts.

2. Catalyst design for coke resistance: Developing catalysts that are less prone to coke formation or can effectively regenerate under reaction conditions.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Finding the optimal balance between N2O concentration, temperature, and other parameters to minimize deactivation while maintaining high selectivity.

4. Exploring novel catalyst supports: Investigating new support materials that can enhance catalyst stability and selectivity.

5. Catalyst regeneration strategies: Developing efficient methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts in-situ or with minimal downtime.

6. Hybrid catalysts: Combining different active components to create synergistic effects that improve both selectivity and stability.

7. Continuous flow systems: Designing reactor systems that allow for continuous catalyst regeneration or replacement.

8. Theoretical studies: Utilizing computational methods to better understand the reaction mechanisms and guide catalyst design.

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop more stable, selective, and commercially viable catalytic systems for propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。这种改进的选择性在各种催化剂中都有观察到，包括含铁沸石、钒基催化剂和钼基催化剂。

使用N2O的主要优势在于它对还原态催化剂物种的氧化能力较弱，特别是对钒氧化物（VOx）物种。这导致催化剂表面处于更还原的状态，与更高的丙烯选择性相关。对于钒基催化剂，使用N2O代替O2可以将丙烯选择性从55%提高到75%，在某些情况下甚至可以达到90%。

在N2O-ODHP中使用了各种催化剂：

1. 铁基材料，如Fe-ZSM-5，提供最高的丙烯产率。
2. 钒基催化剂，在使用N2O时显示出显著的选择性改善。
3. 钼基催化剂，在添加N2O时也表现出丙烯选择性的增加。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，主要是由于结焦形成。这个问题使得N2O目前作为氧化剂的可行性低于其他软氧化剂，如CO2。据报道，钒基和铁基催化剂都会在几小时内失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 深入研究失活机理：清楚地理解催化剂如何和为什么失活对开发更稳定的催化剂至关重要。

2. 设计抗结焦催化剂：开发不易形成焦炭或能在反应条件下有效再生的催化剂。

3. 优化反应条件：找到N2O浓度、温度和其他参数之间的最佳平衡，以最小化失活同时保持高选择性。

4. 探索新型催化剂载体：研究可以增强催化剂稳定性和选择性的新载体材料。

5. 催化剂再生策略：开发高效的原位催化剂再生方法或最小化停机时间的再生方法。

6. 混合催化剂：结合不同的活性组分，创造能够同时提高选择性和稳定性的协同效应。

7. 连续流系统：设计允许连续催化剂再生或更换的反应器系统。

8. 理论研究：利用计算方法更好地理解反应机理，指导催化剂设计。

通过关注这些领域，研究人员可能能够克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，开发出更稳定、更具选择性和商业可行性的丙烯生产催化系统。
