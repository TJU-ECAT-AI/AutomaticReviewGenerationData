<questions>

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not discuss the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document primarily focuses on the use of oxygen (O2) as the oxidant and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the catalyst. It does not provide information on N2O-ODHP, its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity, catalysts employed with N2O, or challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in this specific process.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided text, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to the question about N2O-ODHP or propose strategies to address its limitations. The document focuses on different aspects of ODHP using O2 and boron-based catalysts, including reaction mechanisms, radical chemistry, and product distributions.

给定的文献并没有讨论一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的氧化剂。该文档主要关注氧气（O2）作为氧化剂和六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂的使用。它没有提供关于N2O-ODHP、其在丙烯选择性方面的优势、与N2O一起使用的催化剂，或与这一特定过程中催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战的信息。

鉴于所提供的文本中缺乏相关信息，我无法对N2O-ODHP的问题提供有意义的回答，也无法提出解决其局限性的策略。该文档主要关注使用O2和基于硼的催化剂进行ODHP的不同方面，包括反应机理、自由基化学和产物分布。

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document primarily focuses on the use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts and supported boron oxide catalysts for ODHP using oxygen (O2) as the oxidant. It does not discuss N2O-ODHP, its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity, catalysts used specifically for N2O-ODHP, or challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability in this process.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the question about N2O-ODHP. To properly address this topic, additional research and literature focusing specifically on N2O as an oxidant in ODHP would be required.

给定的文献中不包含任何关于使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的氧化剂的信息。该文档主要关注六方氮化硼(h-BN)催化剂和负载型硼氧化物催化剂在使用氧气(O2)作为氧化剂的ODHP反应中的应用。它并未讨论N2O-ODHP、其在丙烯选择性方面的优势、专门用于N2O-ODHP的催化剂，或与此过程中催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息，我无法对N2O-ODHP的问题提供全面的回答。要正确解答这个话题，需要额外的研究和专门关注N2O作为ODHP氧化剂的文献。

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The text primarily focuses on the use of oxygen (O2) as the oxidant and discusses the reaction mechanisms and pathways over boron-based catalysts, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts. It does not mention N2O or compare different oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity.

The literature does not discuss catalyst deactivation or stability issues specifically related to N2O-ODHP. It also doesn't provide information about various catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP processes or propose strategies to address limitations of this specific process.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided text, it is not possible to accurately answer the question about N2O as an oxidant in ODHP, its advantages, challenges, or potential strategies for improvement based solely on this literature.

所给文献中没有包含任何关于使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中氧化剂的信息。文本主要集中讨论了使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂，并探讨了在硼基催化剂（特别是六方氮化硼（h-BN）和负载型氧化硼催化剂）上的反应机理和途径。文中没有提到N2O或比较不同氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面的差异。

文献没有讨论特别与N2O-ODHP相关的催化剂失活或稳定性问题。它也没有提供关于N2O-ODHP过程中使用的各种催化剂的信息，或提出解决这一特定过程限制的策略。

鉴于所提供的文本中缺乏相关信息，仅基于这篇文献无法准确回答关于N2O作为ODHP中氧化剂的问题，包括其优势、挑战或潜在的改进策略。
