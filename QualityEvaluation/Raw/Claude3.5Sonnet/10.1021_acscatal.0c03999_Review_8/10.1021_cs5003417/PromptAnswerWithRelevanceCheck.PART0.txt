If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

Unfortunately, this document does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The given literature appears to be only a title and bibliographic information for a review article on the kinetics of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over supported vanadium oxide catalysts. It does not provide any details about specific oxidants, catalysts, or challenges associated with the process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given information.

很遗憾，这份文献并未包含任何关于使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中的氧化剂的信息。给出的文献似乎只是一篇关于负载型钒氧化物催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢动力学的综述文章的标题和文献信息。它没有提供有关特定氧化剂、催化剂或与该过程相关的挑战的任何细节。因此，我无法根据所给信息回答这个问题。
