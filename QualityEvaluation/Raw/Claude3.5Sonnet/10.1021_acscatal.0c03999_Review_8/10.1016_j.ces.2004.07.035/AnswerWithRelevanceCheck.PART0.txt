          [1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites."

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Higher propylene yields: N2O-mediated ODHP using steam-activated Fe-zeolites achieves initial propene yields of up to 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts using O2.

2. Specificity as a monooxygen donor: N2O's ability to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species in Fe-zeolites allows for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

3. Significantly higher selectivity: ODHP with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%), while N2O-mediated ODHP can achieve yields above 20%.

4. Reduced over-oxidation: Adding even a small amount of O2 to the N2O reaction mixture results in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 52% to 30%, favoring COx production. This demonstrates N2O's superior selectivity.

5. Dual benefits: The reaction allows for the functionalization of propane, a cheap and abundant feedstock, while also utilizing N2O, an environmentally harmful gas.

The superior performance of N2O in ODHP is attributed to its specificity as a monooxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms in zeolites to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, leading to efficient propane dehydrogenation.

          使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂有以下几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯产率：使用蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石进行N2O介导的ODHP在773-798 K下可达到高达24%的初始丙烯产率，这与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

2. 作为单氧供体的特异性：N2O在Fe-沸石中协调活性原子氧物种的能力允许高效的丙烷脱氢。

3. 显著更高的选择性：使用O2进行ODHP导致低C3H6产率（<5%），而N2O介导的ODHP可以达到20%以上的产率。

4. 减少过度氧化：向N2O反应混合物中添加少量O2会导致C3H6选择性从52%降至30%，有利于COx生成。这证明了N2O的优越选择性。

5. 双重效益：该反应可以实现丙烷（一种廉价且丰富的原料）的官能化，同时利用N2O（一种对环境有害的气体）。

N2O在ODHP中的优异性能归因于其作为单氧供体的特异性，以及某些沸石中铁形态协调活性原子氧物种的能力，从而导致高效的丙烷脱氢。

[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

[5] "Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003), addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5."

          The main catalysts employed in N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) are iron zeolites, specifically:

1. FeZSM-5
2. Fe-silicalite
3. Fe-beta

Among these, FeZSM-5 demonstrates the best performance and stability:

1. Superior resistance to deactivation: FeZSM-5 shows the lowest rate of deactivation compared to Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta.

2. Improved performance over time: FeZSM-5 exhibits an increase in propene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 minutes of reaction.

3. Sustained high yield: FeZSM-5 maintains a high C3H6 yield for 75 minutes, while Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta become severely or completely deactivated in the same period.

The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to:

1. N2O's specificity as a monooxygen donor
2. The ability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, enabling efficient propane dehydrogenation

Additionally, research suggests that adding small amounts of O2 to the feed may help minimize or suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits on FeZSM-5, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

          在N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中使用的主要催化剂是铁沸石，具体包括：

1. FeZSM-5
2. Fe-硅酸盐
3. Fe-beta沸石

其中，FeZSM-5表现出最佳的性能和稳定性：

1. 优异的抗失活能力：与Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta相比，FeZSM-5显示出最低的失活速率。

2. 反应过程中性能提升：FeZSM-5在反应的前20分钟内丙烯产率从22%增加到25%。

3. 持续高产率：FeZSM-5在75分钟内保持高C3H6产率，而Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta在同一时期内严重或完全失活。

Fe-沸石的出色性能归因于：

1. N2O作为单氧供体的特异性
2. 沸石中某些铁形态协调活性原子氧物种的能力，实现高效的丙烷脱氢

此外，研究表明，在进料中添加少量O2可能有助于最小化或抑制FeZSM-5上碳质沉积物的形成，潜在地提高催化剂寿命。
