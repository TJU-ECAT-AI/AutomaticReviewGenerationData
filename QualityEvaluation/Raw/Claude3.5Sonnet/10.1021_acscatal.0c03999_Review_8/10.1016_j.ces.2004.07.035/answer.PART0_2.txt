[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[5] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

[6] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

[7] "Fig. 7 clearly shows that propene yields > 20% can be maintained over FeZSM-5 during 2000 min by alternation of the reaction and regeneration cycles."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages:

1. High propylene selectivity: N2O-mediated ODHP using Fe-zeolites achieves initial propene yields of up to 24%, comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as the oxidant.

2. Utilization of harmful gas: The process allows for the utilization of N2O, which is an environmentally harmful gas, while simultaneously functionalizing propane, a cheap and abundant feedstock.

3. Superior performance: Steam-activated Fe-zeolites show superior performance in N2O-mediated ODHP compared to other catalysts.

The main catalysts employed in this process are iron zeolites, specifically:
- FeZSM-5
- Fe-silicalite
- Fe-beta

Among these, FeZSM-5 demonstrates the best performance and stability.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: The major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield.

2. Varying deactivation rates: The rate of deactivation differs among the zeolites, with Fe-beta deactivating fastest, followed by Fe-silicalite, and FeZSM-5 showing the best resistance to deactivation.

3. Regeneration necessity: Although the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen, this adds complexity to the process.

Strategies to address these limitations and improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP include:

1. Catalyst optimization: Focus on developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, potentially by modifying the FeZSM-5 structure or composition.

2. Cyclic operation: Implement a cyclically-operated process with alternating reaction and regeneration cycles, as demonstrated in the study, which maintained propene yields above 20% for extended periods.

3. Multi-reactor systems: Develop systems with multiple parallel reactors to allow for continuous production while accommodating regeneration cycles.

4. Process optimization: Fine-tune reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas composition, to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene yields.

5. Novel reactor designs: Explore alternative reactor configurations, such as fluidized-bed or moving-bed reactors, which may offer improved heat management and easier catalyst regeneration.

6. Hybrid processes: Investigate the potential of combining N2O-ODHP with other technologies or feedstocks to create more efficient and economically viable processes.

Future research directions should focus on understanding the mechanisms of coke formation and catalyst deactivation at a molecular level, which could lead to the development of more stable and efficient catalysts for N2O-ODHP.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂具有以下几个优点：

1. 高丙烯选择性：使用Fe-沸石的N2O介导的ODHP可以达到高达24%的初始丙烯产率，与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂报告的最高值相当。

2. 利用有害气体：该过程可以利用环境有害气体N2O，同时功能化便宜且丰富的原料丙烷。

3. 优越性能：蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出比其他催化剂更优越的性能。

这个过程中使用的主要催化剂是铁沸石，具体包括：
- FeZSM-5

- Fe-β沸石

其中，FeZSM-5表现出最佳的性能和稳定性。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 结焦形成：Fe-沸石在N2O介导的ODHP中的主要缺点是由于结焦导致的失活，造成丙烯产率的快速下降。

2. 不同的失活速率：沸石之间的失活速率不同，Fe-β沸石失活最快，其次是Fe-硅酸盐，FeZSM-5表现出最好的抗失活能力。

3. 再生必要性：虽然原始催化活性可以通过纯氧再生恢复，但这增加了过程的复杂性。

解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP可行性的策略包括：

1. 催化剂优化：专注于开发具有更好抗结焦能力的催化剂，可能通过修改FeZSM-5的结构或组成。

2. 循环操作：实施反应和再生循环交替的循环操作过程，如研究中所示，可以长时间保持20%以上的丙烯产率。

3. 多反应器系统：开发具有多个并联反应器的系统，以实现连续生产，同时适应再生循环。

4. 过程优化：微调反应条件，如温度和气体组成，以最小化结焦形成，同时保持高丙烯产率。

5. 新型反应器设计：探索替代反应器配置，如流化床或移动床反应器，可能提供更好的热管理和更容易的催化剂再生。

6. 混合工艺：研究将N2O-ODHP与其他技术或原料结合的潜力，以创造更高效和经济可行的工艺。

未来的研究方向应该聚焦于在分子水平上理解结焦形成和催化剂失活的机理，这可能导致开发出更稳定和高效的N2O-ODHP催化剂。
