(1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[4] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

N2O shows superior performance as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like O2. The main advantages of using N2O include:

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O-mediated ODHP achieves propene yields up to 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the best results with V and Mo-based catalysts using O2.

2. Specificity as a monooxygen donor: N2O's ability to provide single oxygen atoms contributes to its efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Utilization of an environmentally harmful gas: The process helps reduce N2O emissions by using it as a reactant.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) showing the most promising results. These catalysts can efficiently coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species from N2O for propane dehydrogenation.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: The main cause of catalyst deactivation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield.

2. Frequent regeneration needs: Although the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration, this requires additional process steps and energy input.

3. Faster deactivation after regeneration: Regenerated catalysts tend to deactivate more quickly than fresh ones, indicating some irreversible changes in the catalyst structure.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop more coke-resistant Fe-zeolite catalysts or explore new catalyst formulations that maintain high activity and selectivity while minimizing coke formation.

2. Process engineering solutions: Implement cyclically-operated reactor systems, such as the demonstrated two fixed-bed reactor setup or a battery of parallel reactors, to enable continuous propylene production through alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.

3. Integration with existing processes: Explore opportunities to economically apply N2O-ODHP in industrial settings where N2O is produced as a byproduct, such as in tail-gases of nitric acid production.

4. Optimization of reaction conditions: Further investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene yield to identify optimal operating parameters.

5. In-situ regeneration methods: Develop techniques for continuous or periodic removal of coke deposits during the reaction, potentially using small amounts of oxygen or other oxidizing agents in the feed.

6. Detailed characterization studies: Conduct comprehensive analyses of fresh, spent, and regenerated catalysts to better understand the deactivation mechanism and design more stable catalysts.

7. Kinetic and mechanistic studies: Investigate the reaction pathways and kinetics of both the ODHP reaction and coke formation to guide catalyst and process improvements.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production, offering both economic and environmental benefits.

[5] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites."

[6] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. N2O-mediated ODHP using steam-activated Fe-zeolites has shown superior performance, achieving initial propene yields of up to 24% at 773-798 K. These yields are comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as the oxidant.

The specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites is highlighted by the significantly higher propylene yields compared to O2. Studies have shown that ODHP with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%), while N2O-mediated ODHP can achieve yields above 20%. This is further demonstrated by experiments where adding even a small amount of O2 to the N2O reaction mixture resulted in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 52% to 30%, favoring COx production instead.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites (such as FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) showing promising results. Among these, FeZSM-5 has demonstrated the best performance in terms of resistance to deactivation and maintaining high propene yields over time.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This causes a rapid decrease in propene yield over time. The deactivation behavior varies among different iron zeolites, with FeZSM-5 showing the best resistance to deactivation. The exact mechanisms behind the different deactivation behaviors are not yet fully understood, but it is suggested that there are active iron sites with varying sensitivities to coke deactivation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Further investigation into the nature of active sites in Fe-zeolites to understand and potentially mitigate the deactivation process.

2. Development of more coke-resistant catalysts or modifications to existing catalysts to improve their stability.

3. Optimization of reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene yields.

4. Implementation of efficient regeneration processes, such as the cyclically-operated reactor system demonstrated in this study, to maintain continuous propylene production.

5. Exploration of novel reactor designs or process configurations that could better manage heat and minimize catalyst deactivation.

6. Investigation of potential synergistic effects between N2O and other oxidants or additives that could enhance catalyst stability without compromising propylene selectivity.

7. Development of in-situ regeneration techniques that could continuously remove coke deposits during the reaction.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable and efficient process for propylene production, while simultaneously addressing the issue of N2O as an environmentally harmful gas.

一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面比其他氧化剂具有几个优势。使用蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石进行的N2O介导的ODHP表现出优异的性能，在773-798 K下达到了高达24%的初始丙烯产率。这些产率与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂报告的最高值相当。

N2O作为Fe-沸石上ODHP反应的单氧供体的特异性体现在与O2相比显著更高的丙烯产率上。研究表明，使用O2的ODHP导致低C3H6产率（<5%），而N2O介导的ODHP可以达到20%以上的产率。这一点通过向N2O反应混合物中添加少量O2导致C3H6选择性从52%降至30%，转而有利于COx生成的实验进一步得到证实。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（如FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta）显示出有前景的结果。在这些催化剂中，FeZSM-5在抗失活和长时间保持高丙烯产率方面表现最佳。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。这会导致丙烯产率随时间迅速下降。不同铁沸石的失活行为各不相同，其中FeZSM-5显示出最佳的抗失活性能。不同失活行为背后的确切机制尚未完全理解，但有迹象表明存在对积碳失活敏感性不同的活性铁位点。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几个策略和研究方向：

1. 进一步研究Fe-沸石中活性位点的性质，以理解并可能减轻失活过程。

2. 开发更耐积碳的催化剂或改进现有催化剂以提高其稳定性。

3. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）以最小化积碳形成，同时保持高丙烯产率。

4. 实施高效的再生过程，如本研究中展示的循环操作反应器系统，以维持连续的丙烯生产。

5. 探索新型反应器设计或工艺配置，以更好地管理热量并最小化催化剂失活。

6. 研究N2O与其他氧化剂或添加剂之间可能的协同效应，以提高催化剂稳定性而不影响丙烯选择性。

7. 开发原位再生技术，可以在反应过程中持续去除积碳沉积物。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP有潜力成为更加可行和高效的丙烯生产工艺，同时解决N2O作为环境有害气体的问题。
