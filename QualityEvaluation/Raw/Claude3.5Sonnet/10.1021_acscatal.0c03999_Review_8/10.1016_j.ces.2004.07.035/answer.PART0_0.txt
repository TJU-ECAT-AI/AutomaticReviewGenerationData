[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

[6] "The feasibility of a process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated in a cyclically-operated reactor with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel"

[7] "This novel catalytic process can be economically applied in tail-gases of specific chemical processes, e.g. those using HNO3 as oxidizing agent, where N2O is produced in high concentration (typically 2540 vol %)."

N2O shows superior performance as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like O2. The main advantages of using N2O include:

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O-mediated ODHP achieves propene yields up to 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the best results with V and Mo-based catalysts using O2.

2. Specificity as a monooxygen donor: N2O's ability to provide single oxygen atoms contributes to its efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Utilization of an environmentally harmful gas: The process helps reduce N2O emissions by using it as a reactant.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) showing the most promising results. These catalysts can efficiently coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species from N2O for propane dehydrogenation.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: The main cause of catalyst deactivation, leading to a rapid decrease in propene yield.

2. Frequent regeneration needs: Although the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration, this requires additional process steps and energy input.

3. Faster deactivation after regeneration: Regenerated catalysts tend to deactivate more quickly than fresh ones, indicating some irreversible changes in the catalyst structure.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop more coke-resistant Fe-zeolite catalysts or explore new catalyst formulations that maintain high activity and selectivity while minimizing coke formation.

2. Process engineering solutions: Implement cyclically-operated reactor systems, such as the demonstrated two fixed-bed reactor setup or a battery of parallel reactors, to enable continuous propylene production through alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.

3. Integration with existing processes: Explore opportunities to economically apply N2O-ODHP in industrial settings where N2O is produced as a byproduct, such as in tail-gases of nitric acid production.

4. Optimization of reaction conditions: Further investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene yield to identify optimal operating parameters.

5. In-situ regeneration methods: Develop techniques for continuous or periodic removal of coke deposits during the reaction, potentially using small amounts of oxygen or other oxidizing agents in the feed.

6. Detailed characterization studies: Conduct comprehensive analyses of fresh, spent, and regenerated catalysts to better understand the deactivation mechanism and design more stable catalysts.

7. Kinetic and mechanistic studies: Investigate the reaction pathways and kinetics of both the ODHP reaction and coke formation to guide catalyst and process improvements.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production, offering both economic and environmental benefits.

与其他氧化剂如O2相比，N2O在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中表现出优越的性能。使用N2O的主要优势包括：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：N2O介导的ODHP在773-798 K下可达到24%的丙烯产率，与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂的最佳结果相当。

2. 作为单氧供体的特异性：N2O提供单个氧原子的能力有助于其在丙烷脱氢中的高效性。

3. 利用环境有害气体：该过程通过将N2O作为反应物来帮助减少N2O排放。

N2O-ODHP中使用了各种催化剂，其中蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe-硅铝石、Fe-β沸石）显示出最promising的结果。这些催化剂可以有效地协调来自N2O的活性原子氧物种，用于丙烷脱氢。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 结焦形成：催化剂失活的主要原因，导致丙烯产率快速下降。

2. 频繁再生需求：虽然通过再生可以恢复原始催化活性，但这需要额外的工艺步骤和能量输入。

3. 再生后更快失活：再生催化剂比新鲜催化剂更快失活，表明催化剂结构发生了一些不可逆的变化。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几种策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发更耐结焦的Fe-沸石催化剂或探索新的催化剂配方，在保持高活性和选择性的同时最小化结焦形成。

2. 工艺工程解决方案：实施循环操作的反应器系统，如已证明的双固定床反应器设置或并联反应器组，通过交替反应和再生循环实现连续丙烯生产。

3. 与现有工艺集成：探索在N2O作为副产品的工业环境中经济应用N2O-ODHP的机会，例如在硝酸生产的尾气中。

4. 反应条件优化：进一步研究温度、压力和进料组成对催化剂稳定性和丙烯产率的影响，以确定最佳操作参数。

5. 原位再生方法：开发反应过程中连续或周期性去除焦炭沉积的技术，可能使用少量氧气或其他氧化剂在进料中。

6. 详细表征研究：对新鲜、失活和再生催化剂进行全面分析，以更好地理解失活机理并设计更稳定的催化剂。

7. 动力学和机理研究：调查ODHP反应和结焦形成的反应途径和动力学，以指导催化剂和工艺改进。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择，提供经济和环境双重效益。
