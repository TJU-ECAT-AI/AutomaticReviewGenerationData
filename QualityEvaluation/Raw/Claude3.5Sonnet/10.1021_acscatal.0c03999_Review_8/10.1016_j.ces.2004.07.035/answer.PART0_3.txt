[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

[6] "Fig. 7 clearly shows that propene yields > 20% can be maintained over FeZSM-5 during 2000 min by alternation of the reaction and regeneration cycles."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Superior performance: Steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as an oxidant have shown initial propene yields of up to 24% at 773-798 K, which is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts using O2.

2. Dual benefits: The reaction allows for the functionalization of propane, a cheap and abundant feedstock, while also utilizing N2O, an environmentally harmful gas.

3. Higher selectivity: When compared to using O2 as an oxidant, N2O demonstrates higher propylene selectivity. For example, adding a small amount of O2 to the reaction mixture decreased C3H6 selectivity from 52% to 30%.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites showing the most promise. The study specifically mentions FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta as catalysts used in N2O-ODHP.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: The major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is deactivation due to coke formation, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield.

2. Varying deactivation rates: The rate of deactivation differs among the zeolites studied, with the order being Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5.

3. Need for regeneration: While the original catalytic activity can be completely recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min, this necessitates a cyclic process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Focus on developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, potentially by modifying the zeolite structure or composition.

2. Process engineering: Implement cyclically-operated reactors, as demonstrated in the study, where propene yields > 20% were maintained over FeZSM-5 for 2000 minutes by alternating reaction and regeneration cycles.

3. Regeneration optimization: Investigate more efficient regeneration methods or conditions to reduce the time and energy required for catalyst reactivation.

4. In-situ regeneration: Explore the possibility of adding small amounts of oxygen or other oxidants to the reaction mixture to continuously regenerate the catalyst without significant loss in selectivity.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct further research to understand the coke formation mechanism and the differences in deactivation rates among various Fe-zeolites to guide catalyst design.

6. Reactor design: Develop novel reactor configurations that can better manage heat and facilitate easier catalyst regeneration, such as moving-bed or fluidized-bed reactors.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial-scale propylene production.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂有以下几个优势：

1. 性能优越：使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石在773-798 K下的初始丙烯收率高达24%，这与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

2. 双重效益：该反应可以实现丙烷（一种廉价且丰富的原料）的官能化，同时利用N2O（一种对环境有害的气体）。

3. 更高的选择性：与使用O2作为氧化剂相比，N2O表现出更高的丙烯选择性。例如，向反应混合物中添加少量O2会使C3H6选择性从52%降低到30%。

在这个过程中使用了多种催化剂，其中蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石表现最为突出。研究特别提到了在N2O-ODHP中使用的FeZSM-5、Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-beta催化剂。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 积碳形成：Fe-沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于积碳形成导致的失活，造成丙烯收率急剧下降。

2. 不同的失活速率：研究的沸石中失活速率存在差异，顺序为Fe-beta > Fe-硅酸盐 > FeZSM-5。

3. 需要再生：虽然通过在773 K下纯氧中再生30分钟可以完全恢复原始催化活性，但这需要一个循环过程。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：专注于开发具有更好抗积碳能力的催化剂，可能通过修改沸石结构或成分来实现。

2. 工艺工程：实施循环操作的反应器，如研究中所示，通过交替反应和再生循环，FeZSM-5的丙烯收率可以在2000分钟内保持在20%以上。

3. 再生优化：研究更高效的再生方法或条件，以减少催化剂再活化所需的时间和能量。

4. 原位再生：探索向反应混合物中添加少量氧气或其他氧化剂的可能性，以持续再生催化剂而不显著损失选择性。

5. 机理研究：进行进一步研究，了解积碳形成机理和各种Fe-沸石之间失活速率的差异，以指导催化剂设计。

6. 反应器设计：开发新型反应器配置，以更好地管理热量并便于催化剂再生，如移动床或流化床反应器。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业规模丙烯生产的更可行选择。
