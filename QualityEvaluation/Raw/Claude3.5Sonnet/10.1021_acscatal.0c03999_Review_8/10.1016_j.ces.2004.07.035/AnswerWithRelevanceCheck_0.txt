          [1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites."

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Superior performance: Steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as an oxidant have shown initial propene yields of up to 24% at 773-798 K, which is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts using O2.

2. Higher selectivity: N2O demonstrates significantly higher propylene selectivity compared to O2. Studies have shown that ODHP with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (&lt; 5%), while N2O-mediated ODHP can achieve yields above 20%.

3. Specificity as a monooxygen donor: The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

4. Reduced over-oxidation: Adding even a small amount of O2 to the N2O reaction mixture resulted in a decrease in C3H6 selectivity from 52% to 30%, favoring COx production instead. This highlights the advantage of using N2O alone as the oxidant.

5. Dual benefits: The reaction allows for the functionalization of propane, a cheap and abundant feedstock, while also utilizing N2O, an environmentally harmful gas, thus addressing two issues simultaneously.

          与其他氧化剂相比，使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有以下几个优势：

1. 性能优越：使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石在773-798 K下的初始丙烯收率高达24%，这与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

2. 更高的选择性：与O2相比，N2O表现出显著更高的丙烯选择性。研究表明，使用O2的ODHP导致低C3H6产率（&lt;5%），而N2O介导的ODHP可以达到20%以上的产率。

3. 作为单氧供体的特异性：Fe-沸石的卓越性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性，以及沸石中某些铁形式协调活性原子氧物种以高效脱氢丙烷的能力。

4. 降低过度氧化：向N2O反应混合物中添加少量O2会导致C3H6选择性从52%降至30%，转而有利于COx生成。这突出了单独使用N2O作为氧化剂的优势。

5. 双重效益：该反应可以实现丙烷（一种廉价且丰富的原料）的官能化，同时利用N2O（一种对环境有害的气体），从而同时解决两个问题。

          The main catalysts employed in N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) are iron zeolites, specifically:

1. FeZSM-5
2. Fe-silicalite
3. Fe-beta

Among these, steam-activated Fe-zeolites have shown superior performance. The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to:

1. The specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor
2. The capability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species for efficient propane dehydrogenation

FeZSM-5 has demonstrated the best performance in terms of stability and resistance to deactivation:

1. It shows remarkable resistance to deactivation, with propene yield increasing from 22% to 25% during the first 20 minutes on stream.
2. The high C3H6 yield is maintained for 75 minutes, while Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period.

The rate of deactivation among the studied zeolites decreases in the following order:
Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5

This indicates that FeZSM-5 is the most stable and resistant to deactivation among the catalysts studied.

2. 在75分钟内保持高C3H6产率，而Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-β沸石在此期间严重或完全失活。

研究的沸石中失活速率按以下顺序递减：
Fe-β沸石 > Fe-硅酸盐 > FeZSM-5

这表明在研究的催化剂中，FeZSM-5是最稳定和最耐失活的。

          [1] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[2] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[3] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."

[4] "Fig. 7 clearly shows that propene yields > 20% can be maintained over FeZSM-5 during 2000 min by alternation of the reaction and regeneration cycles."

          The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-mediated ODHP include:

1. Coke formation: The major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is deactivation due to coke formation, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield.

2. Varying deactivation rates: Different Fe-zeolites show different rates of deactivation, with the order being Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5. This suggests that the stability of the catalyst depends on the specific type of Fe-zeolite used.

3. Incomplete understanding of deactivation mechanisms: The different deactivation behavior of various iron zeolites is not satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivities to coke deactivation.

4. Need for frequent regeneration: Although the original catalytic activity can be completely recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min, this necessitates a cyclic process, which adds complexity to the overall system.

5. Potential for long-term stability issues: While propene yields > 20% can be maintained over FeZSM-5 for extended periods (up to 2000 min) by alternating reaction and regeneration cycles, the long-term stability and performance of the catalyst over multiple cycles need further investigation.

          N2O介导的ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 积碳形成：Fe-沸石在N2O-ODHP中的主要缺点是由于积碳形成导致的失活，造成丙烯产率急剧下降。

2. 不同的失活速率：不同的Fe-沸石显示出不同的失活速率，顺序为Fe-β沸石 > Fe-硅酸盐 > FeZSM-5。这表明催化剂的稳定性取决于所使用的特定类型的Fe-沸石。

3. 对失活机制的理解不完整：在目前阶段，无法令人满意地解释各种铁沸石的不同失活行为。FeZSM-5的行为表明存在对积碳失活敏感性不同的活性铁位点。

4. 需要频繁再生：虽然通过在773 K下纯氧中再生30分钟可以完全恢复原始催化活性，但这需要一个循环过程，增加了整个系统的复杂性。

5. 潜在的长期稳定性问题：虽然通过交替反应和再生循环，FeZSM-5的丙烯产率可以在长时间内（高达2000分钟）保持在20%以上，但催化剂在多个循环中的长期稳定性和性能仍需进一步研究。
