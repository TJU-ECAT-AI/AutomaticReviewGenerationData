[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[5] "Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003), addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5. Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites."

N2O shows superior performance as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like O2. The main advantages of using N2O include:

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O-mediated ODHP over Fe-zeolites achieved initial propene yields of 24%, comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts with O2.

2. Specificity as a monooxygen donor: N2O's ability to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species in Fe-zeolites allows for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

3. Lower over-oxidation: ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (<5%), while N2O allows for much higher yields.

The main catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP are Fe-zeolites, including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta. Among these, FeZSM-5 shows the best performance in terms of stability and resistance to deactivation.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: This is the major drawback, causing rapid decrease in propene yield.

2. Varying deactivation rates: Different Fe-zeolites show different rates of deactivation, with Fe-beta deactivating fastest and FeZSM-5 showing the best resistance.

3. Need for frequent regeneration: Although the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration, this requires additional process steps and energy input.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Further research into improving the stability of Fe-zeolites, particularly focusing on the factors that make FeZSM-5 more resistant to deactivation.

2. Process engineering: Developing efficient cyclic processes that integrate reaction and regeneration steps, such as the parallel fixed-bed reactor system described in the study.

3. Feed composition optimization: Investigating the optimal ratio of N2O to O2 in the feed to balance high propylene yield with reduced coke formation.

4. Novel catalyst formulations: Exploring new catalyst compositions or supports that can maintain high activity and selectivity while improving resistance to coke formation.

5. In-situ regeneration techniques: Developing methods to continuously remove coke or regenerate the catalyst during the reaction, potentially using the N2O itself as a regenerating agent.

6. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: Conducting detailed characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts to better understand the nature and location of coke formation, which could inform better catalyst design.

一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂，相比其他氧化剂如O2表现出优越的性能。使用N2O的主要优势包括：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：N2O介导的ODHP在Fe-沸石上实现了24%的初始丙烯产率，可与V和Mo基催化剂使用O2时报道的最高值相媲美。

2. 作为单氧供体的特异性：N2O在Fe-沸石中协调活性原子氧物种的能力允许高效的丙烷脱氢。

3. 较低的过度氧化：使用O2进行丙烷的ODH导致低C3H6产率(<5%)，而N2O允许获得更高的产率。

N2O-ODHP中使用的主要催化剂是Fe-沸石，包括FeZSM-5、Fe-硅铝石和Fe-β沸石。其中，FeZSM-5在稳定性和抗失活方面表现最佳。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 积碳形成：这是主要缺点，导致丙烯产率迅速下降。

2. 不同的失活速率：不同的Fe-沸石显示不同的失活速率，Fe-β沸石失活最快，而FeZSM-5显示最佳的抗失活性。

3. 需要频繁再生：虽然通过再生可以恢复原始催化活性，但这需要额外的工艺步骤和能量输入。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：进一步研究改善Fe-沸石的稳定性，特别关注使FeZSM-5更耐失活的因素。

2. 工艺工程：开发高效的循环过程，集成反应和再生步骤，如研究中描述的并联固定床反应器系统。

3. 进料组成优化：研究N2O与O2在进料中的最佳比例，以平衡高丙烯产率和减少积碳形成。

4. 新型催化剂配方：探索新的催化剂组成或载体，以保持高活性和选择性，同时提高抗积碳形成能力。

5. 原位再生技术：开发在反应过程中连续去除积碳或再生催化剂的方法，可能使用N2O本身作为再生剂。

6. 理解失活机制：对使用过和再生的催化剂进行详细表征，以更好地理解积碳形成的性质和位置，这可以为更好的催化剂设计提供信息。
