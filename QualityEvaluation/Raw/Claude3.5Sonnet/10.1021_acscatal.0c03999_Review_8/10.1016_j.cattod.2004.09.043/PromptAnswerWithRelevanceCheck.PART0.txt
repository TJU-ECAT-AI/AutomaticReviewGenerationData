[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The addition of N2O to the reaction feed leads to a substantial increase in selectivity, with improvements of up to 141% observed in some cases. This improvement in selectivity is attributed to N2O's ability to inhibit non-selective sites on the catalyst surface.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with the study focusing on NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts. These catalysts show promising results when used in conjunction with N2O as a promoter.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The study reveals that N2O alone is not sufficient for maintaining catalyst activity. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O; otherwise, the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (particularly molybdenum), leading to high carbon formation and subsequent deactivation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimizing the ratio of N2O to O2: Finding the right balance between N2O (for selectivity) and O2 (for catalyst regeneration) could maximize propylene yield while maintaining catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to reduction by N2O could help maintain activity over longer periods.

3. Periodic regeneration: Implementing a cyclic process where the catalyst is periodically exposed to higher O2 concentrations could help maintain its activity.

4. Exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts: These might offer better resistance to deactivation while maintaining the selectivity benefits of N2O.

5. In-situ characterization studies: Conducting more detailed investigations of the catalyst surface during reaction could provide insights into the mechanisms of deactivation and guide catalyst design.

6. Process engineering: Developing reactor designs that allow for better control of the oxidation state of the catalyst throughout the reaction could help maintain optimal performance.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。向反应进料中添加N2O可显著提高选择性，在某些情况下选择性提高幅度高达141%。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O抑制催化剂表面非选择性位点的能力。

该过程中使用了多种催化剂，研究主要集中在NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41介孔催化剂上。这些催化剂与N2O作为促进剂一起使用时显示出良好的效果。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性方面存在关键挑战。研究表明，单独使用N2O不足以维持催化剂活性。在存在N2O的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂；否则，催化剂会迅速失活。N2O会还原催化剂（特别是钼），导致高碳形成和随后的失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O与O2的比例：找到N2O（提高选择性）和O2（催化剂再生）之间的适当平衡，可以在保持催化剂稳定性的同时最大化丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂设计：开发对N2O还原更具抗性的催化剂，有助于长期保持活性。

3. 周期性再生：实施周期性过程，定期将催化剂暴露在较高O2浓度下，有助于维持其活性。

4. 探索双金属或多组分催化剂：这可能在保持N2O选择性优势的同时提供更好的抗失活能力。

5. 原位表征研究：对反应过程中催化剂表面进行更详细的研究，可以提供关于失活机理的见解，指导催化剂设计。

6. 过程工程：开发允许在整个反应过程中更好地控制催化剂氧化状态的反应器设计，有助于保持最佳性能。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP目前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。

[5] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon. This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Significant increase in selectivity: The addition of N2O leads to a substantial increase in propylene selectivity, with improvements of up to 141% observed.

2. Moderate yield improvement: While the conversion decreases, there is still a modest increase in propylene yield (up to 22%) when using N2O.

3. Tunable performance: The amount of N2O added can be adjusted to optimize the balance between conversion and selectivity.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including:
- NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts
- Catalysts with different numbers of NiMoO4 monolayers on MCM-41 support

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Carbon deposition: In the absence of O2, high amounts of carbon are deposited on the catalyst surface, leading to deactivation.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O. Without O2, the catalyst deactivates quickly.

3. Conversion-selectivity trade-off: While N2O improves selectivity, it also leads to a significant decrease in conversion, which may limit overall productivity.

Strategies or research directions to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation include:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while minimizing the decrease in conversion when using N2O.

2. Co-feed studies: Investigate the optimal ratio of N2O and O2 in the feed to balance selectivity, conversion, and catalyst stability.

3. Catalyst regeneration techniques: Explore methods for efficient in-situ regeneration of catalysts to prolong their lifetime and maintain activity.

4. Support material engineering: Develop novel support materials or modify existing ones to enhance catalyst stability and resistance to carbon deposition.

5. Process integration: Design reactor systems that can effectively manage the heat generated by the reaction and optimize the contact time between reactants and catalyst.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The literature shows that adding 1-5 vol% N2O to the feed led to a substantial increase in selectivity (up to 141%) and yield (up to 22%) of propylene, despite a decrease in overall propane conversion.

The catalysts employed in this process include NiMoO4-based catalysts, particularly those supported on mesoporous materials like [Si,V]-MCM-41. These mesoporous catalysts show promise for selective ODHP reactions when combined with N2O as an oxidant.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The literature indicates that N2O reduces the catalysts, particularly the molybdenum component, leading to high carbon formation. This reduction and carbon deposition can cause rapid deactivation of the catalyst if molecular oxygen is not present to regenerate the active sites.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to reduction by N2O while maintaining high selectivity to propylene. This could involve exploring new support materials or modifying the active metal components.

2. Oxidant mixture optimization: Find the optimal ratio of N2O to O2 in the feed to balance high selectivity with catalyst stability. This may involve using N2O as a promoter rather than the sole oxidant.

3. Process engineering: Implement regeneration cycles or continuous regeneration techniques to prevent catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition.

4. In-situ characterization: Conduct more detailed studies on the catalyst surface during reaction conditions to better understand the role of N2O and the mechanism of catalyst deactivation.

5. Novel reactor designs: Explore membrane reactors or other configurations that could help maintain the optimal oxidation state of the catalyst while using N2O.

6. Promoter addition: Investigate the use of additional promoters that could stabilize the catalyst in the presence of N2O while maintaining high selectivity.

By addressing these challenges through focused research efforts, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The literature shows that adding 1-5 vol% N2O to the feed substantially increases selectivity to propylene (by 105-141%) while decreasing propane conversion. This suggests N2O promotes more selective oxidation of propane to propylene.

Various catalysts have been employed for N2O-ODHP, including NiMoO4 supported on vanadium-containing MCM-41 mesoporous materials. These catalysts show promise for selective propylene production when using N2O.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP. The study found that using only N2O without O2 leads to rapid catalyst deactivation due to carbon formation. N2O reduces the catalyst (e.g. molybdenum species), which promotes coking. 

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, some potential strategies include:

1. Co-feeding small amounts of O2 with N2O to maintain catalyst oxidation state and inhibit coking.

2. Developing more coke-resistant catalyst formulations, potentially using promoters or supports that enhance oxidation resistance.

3. Optimizing N2O concentration to balance selectivity improvements with conversion losses.

4. Investigating redox cycling or regeneration procedures to periodically remove coke and re-oxidize the catalyst.

5. Exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts that can better maintain activity under N2O conditions.

6. Studying the mechanism of N2O activation on different catalysts to guide rational catalyst design.

Further research in these directions could help overcome stability issues and potentially make N2O-ODHP more viable for practical propylene production. The high selectivity achievable with N2O provides motivation to solve these challenges.
