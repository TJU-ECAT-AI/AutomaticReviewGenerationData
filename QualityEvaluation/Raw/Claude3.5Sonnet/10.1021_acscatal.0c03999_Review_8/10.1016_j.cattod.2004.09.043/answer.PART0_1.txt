[1] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[2] "When the amount of N2O is higher (5 vol.%), a weak increase in the conversion seems to occur (about 4%). This trend could indicate that a minimum in the conversion as a function of the amount of N2O might be obtained."

[3] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[4] "An interesting result was obtained with 1 (monolayer)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst in the presence of 5 vol.% N2O only (i.e. without O2). In this case, the conversion of propane was 6.8% and the yield and the selectivity in propylene were 3.2 and 47.5%, respectively."

[5] "On the other hand, in the absence of O2, the catalysts show a very high amount of carbon. This observation indicates that the use of pure N2O to perform the ODP is not advisable. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Significant increase in selectivity: The addition of N2O leads to a substantial increase in propylene selectivity, with improvements of up to 141% observed.

2. Moderate yield improvement: While the conversion decreases, there is still a modest increase in propylene yield (up to 22%) when using N2O.

3. Tunable performance: The amount of N2O added can be adjusted to optimize the balance between conversion and selectivity.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including:
- NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts
- Catalysts with different numbers of NiMoO4 monolayers on MCM-41 support

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Carbon deposition: In the absence of O2, high amounts of carbon are deposited on the catalyst surface, leading to deactivation.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O. Without O2, the catalyst deactivates quickly.

3. Conversion-selectivity trade-off: While N2O improves selectivity, it also leads to a significant decrease in conversion, which may limit overall productivity.

Strategies or research directions to address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation include:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while minimizing the decrease in conversion when using N2O.

2. Co-feed studies: Investigate the optimal ratio of N2O and O2 in the feed to balance selectivity, conversion, and catalyst stability.

3. Catalyst regeneration techniques: Explore methods for efficient in-situ regeneration of catalysts to prolong their lifetime and maintain activity.

4. Support material engineering: Develop novel support materials or modify existing ones to enhance catalyst stability and resistance to carbon deposition.

5. Process integration: Design reactor systems that can effectively manage the heat generated by the reaction and optimize the contact time between reactants and catalyst.

6. Mechanistic studies: Conduct detailed investigations into the reaction mechanism of N2O-ODHP to better understand and control the factors affecting selectivity and conversion.

7. Promoter addition: Explore the use of promoters or dopants that can enhance the stability of the catalyst in the presence of N2O while maintaining high selectivity.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, it may be possible to develop a more efficient and commercially viable N2O-ODHP process.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面显示出几个优势：

1. 选择性显著提高：添加N2O导致丙烯选择性大幅提高，观察到的改善可达141%。

2. 产率适度提高：虽然转化率下降，但使用N2O时丙烯产率仍有适度提高（最高22%）。

3. 可调性能：可以调整添加的N2O量，以优化转化率和选择性之间的平衡。

- NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41介孔催化剂
- 在MCM-41载体上具有不同NiMoO4单层数的催化剂

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 碳沉积：在没有O2的情况下，大量碳沉积在催化剂表面，导致失活。

2. 催化剂再生：在N2O存在的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂。没有O2，催化剂会快速失活。

3. 转化率-选择性权衡：虽然N2O提高了选择性，但也导致转化率显著下降，可能限制整体生产力。

解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用的策略或研究方向包括：

1. 催化剂优化：开发在使用N2O时能保持高选择性同时最小化转化率下降的催化剂。

2. 共进料研究：研究进料中N2O和O2的最佳比例，以平衡选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。

3. 催化剂再生技术：探索高效的原位催化剂再生方法，以延长其寿命并保持活性。

4. 载体材料工程：开发新型载体材料或修改现有材料，以增强催化剂稳定性和抗碳沉积能力。

5. 过程集成：设计能有效管理反应产生的热量并优化反应物与催化剂接触时间的反应器系统。

6. 机理研究：对N2O-ODHP的反应机理进行详细研究，以更好地理解和控制影响选择性和转化率的因素。

7. 助剂添加：探索使用助剂或掺杂剂，在保持高选择性的同时增强催化剂在N2O存在下的稳定性。
