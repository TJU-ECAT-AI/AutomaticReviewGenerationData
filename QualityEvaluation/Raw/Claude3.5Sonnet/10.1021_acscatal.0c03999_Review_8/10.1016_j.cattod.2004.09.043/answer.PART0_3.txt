[1] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[2] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[3] "It seems that the principal consequences of the addition of N2O can be attributed to a decrease of the number of non-selective sites present on the supported mesoporous catalysts."

[4] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The addition of N2O leads to a substantial increase in selectivity, with improvements of up to 141% observed in some cases. This enhanced selectivity is attributed to a decrease in the number of non-selective sites on the catalyst surface.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, including NiMoO4-based catalysts supported on mesoporous materials such as [Si,V]-MCM-41. These catalysts show promising results when used with N2O as an oxidant.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP. The literature indicates that N2O reduces the catalysts, particularly molybdenum, leading to high carbon formation. This reduction can cause rapid catalyst deactivation if molecular oxygen is not present to oxidize and regenerate the catalyst.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Develop more stable catalysts that resist reduction by N2O while maintaining high selectivity.

2. Investigate optimal ratios of N2O to O2 in the feed to balance high selectivity with catalyst stability.

3. Explore catalyst regeneration techniques to extend catalyst lifetime.

4. Study the mechanism of N2O interaction with different catalyst compositions to design more efficient and stable catalytic systems.

5. Investigate the use of promoters or dopants that could enhance catalyst stability in the presence of N2O.

6. Develop in-situ catalyst characterization techniques to better understand and control the catalyst state during reaction.

7. Explore novel reactor designs that could minimize carbon formation and maintain catalyst activity.

By addressing these challenges, researchers could potentially unlock the full potential of N2O-ODHP as a selective and efficient process for propylene production.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。添加N2O可以显著提高选择性，在某些情况下选择性提高可达141%。这种选择性的提高被认为是由于催化剂表面非选择性位点数量的减少。

N2O-ODHP反应中使用了多种催化剂，包括负载在[Si,V]-MCM-41等介孔材料上的NiMoO4基催化剂。这些催化剂在使用N2O作为氧化剂时表现出很有前景的结果。

然而，N2O-ODHP反应中存在与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。文献表明，N2O会还原催化剂，特别是钼，导致大量碳沉积。如果没有分子氧存在来氧化和再生催化剂，这种还原会导致催化剂快速失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 开发更稳定的催化剂，能够抵抗N2O的还原作用，同时保持高选择性。

2. 研究N2O与O2在进料中的最佳比例，以平衡高选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 探索催化剂再生技术，延长催化剂寿命。

4. 研究N2O与不同催化剂组成的相互作用机理，以设计更高效和稳定的催化体系。

5. 研究使用助剂或掺杂剂，可能增强催化剂在N2O存在下的稳定性。

6. 开发原位催化剂表征技术，以更好地理解和控制反应过程中的催化剂状态。

7. 探索新型反应器设计，可以最大限度地减少碳沉积并保持催化剂活性。

通过解决这些挑战，研究人员有可能充分发挥N2O-ODHP作为一种选择性高、效率高的丙烯生产工艺的潜力。
