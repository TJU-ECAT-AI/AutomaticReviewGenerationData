[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

[2] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[3] "When the amount of N2O is higher (5 vol.%), a weak increase in the conversion seems to occur (about 4%). This trend could indicate that a minimum in the conversion as a function of the amount of N2O might be obtained."

[4] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[5] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The literature shows that adding 1-5 vol% N2O to the feed led to a substantial increase in selectivity (up to 141%) and yield (up to 22%) of propylene, despite a decrease in overall propane conversion.

The catalysts employed in this process include NiMoO4-based catalysts, particularly those supported on mesoporous materials like [Si,V]-MCM-41. These mesoporous catalysts show promise for selective ODHP reactions when combined with N2O as an oxidant.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The literature indicates that N2O reduces the catalysts, particularly the molybdenum component, leading to high carbon formation. This reduction and carbon deposition can cause rapid deactivation of the catalyst if molecular oxygen is not present to regenerate the active sites.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to reduction by N2O while maintaining high selectivity to propylene. This could involve exploring new support materials or modifying the active metal components.

2. Oxidant mixture optimization: Find the optimal ratio of N2O to O2 in the feed to balance high selectivity with catalyst stability. This may involve using N2O as a promoter rather than the sole oxidant.

3. Process engineering: Implement regeneration cycles or continuous regeneration techniques to prevent catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition.

4. In-situ characterization: Conduct more detailed studies on the catalyst surface during reaction conditions to better understand the role of N2O and the mechanism of catalyst deactivation.

5. Novel reactor designs: Explore membrane reactors or other configurations that could help maintain the optimal oxidation state of the catalyst while using N2O.

6. Promoter addition: Investigate the use of additional promoters that could stabilize the catalyst in the presence of N2O while maintaining high selectivity.

By addressing these challenges through focused research efforts, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有显著优势。文献表明,向反应物中添加1-5体积%的N2O可使丙烯的选择性大幅提高(最高141%)和产率增加(最高22%),尽管总体丙烷转化率有所下降。

这一过程中使用的催化剂包括基于NiMoO4的催化剂,特别是负载在[Si,V]-MCM-41等介孔材料上的催化剂。当与N2O作为氧化剂结合使用时,这些介孔催化剂在选择性ODHP反应中显示出很大潜力。

然而,催化剂失活和稳定性方面存在关键挑战。文献指出,N2O会还原催化剂,特别是钼组分,导致高碳形成。如果没有分子氧来再生活性位点,这种还原和碳沉积会导致催化剂快速失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用,可以探索以下几种策略:

1. 催化剂设计:开发对N2O还原更具抗性的催化剂,同时保持对丙烯的高选择性。这可能涉及探索新的载体材料或修改活性金属组分。

2. 氧化剂混合物优化:找出反应物中N2O与O2的最佳比例,以平衡高选择性和催化剂稳定性。这可能涉及将N2O作为助剂而非唯一氧化剂使用。

3. 工艺工程:实施再生循环或连续再生技术,以防止由于碳沉积导致的催化剂失活。

4. 原位表征:在反应条件下对催化剂表面进行更详细的研究,以更好地理解N2O的作用和催化剂失活机理。

5. 新型反应器设计:探索膜反应器或其他配置,有助于在使用N2O的同时维持催化剂的最佳氧化状态。

6. 助剂添加:研究使用额外的助剂,在N2O存在的情况下稳定催化剂,同时保持高选择性。

通过针对性的研究努力解决这些挑战,N2O-ODHP有潜力成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择。
