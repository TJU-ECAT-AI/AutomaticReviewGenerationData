[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

[2] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[3] "When the amount of N2O is higher (5 vol.%), a weak increase in the conversion seems to occur (about 4%). This trend could indicate that a minimum in the conversion as a function of the amount of N2O might be obtained."

[4] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[5] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The literature shows that adding 1-5 vol% N2O to the feed substantially increases selectivity to propylene (by 105-141%) while decreasing propane conversion. This suggests N2O promotes more selective oxidation of propane to propylene.

Various catalysts have been employed for N2O-ODHP, including NiMoO4 supported on vanadium-containing MCM-41 mesoporous materials. These catalysts show promise for selective propylene production when using N2O.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP. The study found that using only N2O without O2 leads to rapid catalyst deactivation due to carbon formation. N2O reduces the catalyst (e.g. molybdenum species), which promotes coking. 

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, some potential strategies include:

1. Co-feeding small amounts of O2 with N2O to maintain catalyst oxidation state and inhibit coking.

2. Developing more coke-resistant catalyst formulations, potentially using promoters or supports that enhance oxidation resistance.

3. Optimizing N2O concentration to balance selectivity improvements with conversion losses.

4. Investigating redox cycling or regeneration procedures to periodically remove coke and re-oxidize the catalyst.

5. Exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts that can better maintain activity under N2O conditions.

6. Studying the mechanism of N2O activation on different catalysts to guide rational catalyst design.

Further research in these directions could help overcome stability issues and potentially make N2O-ODHP more viable for practical propylene production. The high selectivity achievable with N2O provides motivation to solve these challenges.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)过程中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂,与其他氧化剂相比,在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。文献表明,向进料中添加1-5体积%的N2O可以大幅提高丙烯的选择性(105-141%),同时降低丙烷转化率。这表明N2O促进了丙烷到丙烯更具选择性的氧化。

N2O-ODHP使用了各种催化剂,包括负载在含钒MCM-41介孔材料上的NiMoO4。这些催化剂在使用N2O时显示出对选择性生产丙烯的潜力。

然而,N2O-ODHP面临着与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。研究发现,仅使用N2O而不使用O2会导致催化剂因碳沉积而快速失活。N2O还原了催化剂(如钼物种),这促进了结焦。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更加可行,一些潜在的策略包括:

1. 与N2O共同通入少量O2,以维持催化剂的氧化态并抑制结焦。

2. 开发更耐焦的催化剂配方,可能使用能增强抗氧化性的助剂或载体。

3. 优化N2O浓度,以平衡选择性提高和转化率损失。

4. 研究氧化还原循环或再生程序,以定期去除焦炭并重新氧化催化剂。

5. 探索在N2O条件下能更好地保持活性的双金属或多组分催化剂。

6. 研究N2O在不同催化剂上的活化机理,以指导合理的催化剂设计。

在这些方向上的进一步研究可能有助于克服稳定性问题,并有可能使N2O-ODHP更适合实际的丙烯生产。N2O可实现的高选择性为解决这些挑战提供了动力。
