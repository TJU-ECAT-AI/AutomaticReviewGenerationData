[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

[2] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[3] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[4] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

[5] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non-selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The addition of N2O to the reaction feed leads to a substantial increase in selectivity, with improvements of up to 141% observed in some cases. This improvement in selectivity is attributed to N2O's ability to inhibit non-selective sites on the catalyst surface.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with the study focusing on NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 mesoporous catalysts. These catalysts show promising results when used in conjunction with N2O as a promoter.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The study reveals that N2O alone is not sufficient for maintaining catalyst activity. Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O; otherwise, the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (particularly molybdenum), leading to high carbon formation and subsequent deactivation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimizing the ratio of N2O to O2: Finding the right balance between N2O (for selectivity) and O2 (for catalyst regeneration) could maximize propylene yield while maintaining catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to reduction by N2O could help maintain activity over longer periods.

3. Periodic regeneration: Implementing a cyclic process where the catalyst is periodically exposed to higher O2 concentrations could help maintain its activity.

4. Exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts: These might offer better resistance to deactivation while maintaining the selectivity benefits of N2O.

5. In-situ characterization studies: Conducting more detailed investigations of the catalyst surface during reaction could provide insights into the mechanisms of deactivation and guide catalyst design.

6. Process engineering: Developing reactor designs that allow for better control of the oxidation state of the catalyst throughout the reaction could help maintain optimal performance.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。向反应进料中添加N2O可显著提高选择性，在某些情况下选择性提高幅度高达141%。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O抑制催化剂表面非选择性位点的能力。

该过程中使用了多种催化剂，研究主要集中在NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41介孔催化剂上。这些催化剂与N2O作为促进剂一起使用时显示出良好的效果。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性方面存在关键挑战。研究表明，单独使用N2O不足以维持催化剂活性。在存在N2O的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂；否则，催化剂会迅速失活。N2O会还原催化剂（特别是钼），导致高碳形成和随后的失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O与O2的比例：找到N2O（提高选择性）和O2（催化剂再生）之间的适当平衡，可以在保持催化剂稳定性的同时最大化丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂设计：开发对N2O还原更具抗性的催化剂，有助于长期保持活性。

3. 周期性再生：实施周期性过程，定期将催化剂暴露在较高O2浓度下，有助于维持其活性。

4. 探索双金属或多组分催化剂：这可能在保持N2O选择性优势的同时提供更好的抗失活能力。

5. 原位表征研究：对反应过程中催化剂表面进行更详细的研究，可以提供关于失活机理的见解，指导催化剂设计。

6. 过程工程：开发允许在整个反应过程中更好地控制催化剂氧化状态的反应器设计，有助于保持最佳性能。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP目前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
