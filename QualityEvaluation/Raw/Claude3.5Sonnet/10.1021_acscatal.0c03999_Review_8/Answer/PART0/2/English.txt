The main catalysts employed in N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) are iron zeolites, specifically:

1. FeZSM-5
2. Fe-silicalite
3. Fe-beta

Among these, FeZSM-5 demonstrates the best performance and stability:

1. Superior resistance to deactivation: FeZSM-5 shows the lowest rate of deactivation compared to Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta.

2. Improved performance over time: FeZSM-5 exhibits an increase in propene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 minutes of reaction.

3. Sustained high yield: FeZSM-5 maintains a high C3H6 yield for 75 minutes, while Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta become severely or completely deactivated in the same period.

The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to:

1. N2O's specificity as a monooxygen donor
2. The ability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species, enabling efficient propane dehydrogenation

Additionally, research suggests that adding small amounts of O2 to the feed may help minimize or suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits on FeZSM-5, potentially improving catalyst longevity.

The study primarily focused on vanadium-based catalysts, specifically V2O3, VO2, and V2O5, for the N2O-ODHP process. These catalysts showed dynamic changes in their oxidation states and surface compositions under reaction conditions.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process, it does mention reaction-induced changes in the catalysts. These changes could potentially impact long-term stability and performance of the catalysts.

To address potential limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop more stable vanadium-based catalysts or explore other metal oxide catalysts that maintain their reduced state under N2O-ODHP conditions.

2. Reaction condition optimization: Investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene yield.

3. Catalyst regeneration methods: Develop efficient techniques to regenerate the catalyst and maintain its activity over extended periods.

4. Support material research: Explore various support materials that can enhance the stability and selectivity of the active vanadium species.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth investigations into the reaction mechanism of N2O-ODHP to better understand and control the factors affecting catalyst stability and selectivity.

6. Process integration: Investigate the potential for integrating N2O-ODHP with other processes to improve overall efficiency and economic viability.

7. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended stability tests to identify and address factors contributing to catalyst deactivation over time.

8. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts: Investigate the use of mixed-metal oxide catalysts or supported vanadium catalysts to enhance stability and selectivity.

9. In-situ characterization: Develop and utilize advanced in-situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst structure and composition under reaction conditions.

10. Theoretical modeling: Use computational modeling to predict catalyst behavior and guide the design of more stable and selective catalysts for N2O-ODHP.

These research directions could help overcome the limitations of the N2O-ODHP process and potentially make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.
