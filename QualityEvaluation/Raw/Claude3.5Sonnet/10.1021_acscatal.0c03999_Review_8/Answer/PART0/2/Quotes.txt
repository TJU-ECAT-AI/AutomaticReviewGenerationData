[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[3] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[4] "FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22 to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6 yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this period on stream."

[5] "Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003), addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5."

The study primarily focused on vanadium-based catalysts (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts undergo significant restructuring under reaction conditions, with their final composition determined by the oxidizing agent used.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the study mentions reaction-induced changes in the catalysts, which could potentially impact long-term stability.

[1] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

[2] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[3] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions. By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."

[4] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
