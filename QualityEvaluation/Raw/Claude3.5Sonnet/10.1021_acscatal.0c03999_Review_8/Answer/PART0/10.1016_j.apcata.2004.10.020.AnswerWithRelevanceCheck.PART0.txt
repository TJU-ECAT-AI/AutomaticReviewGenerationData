          [1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "Propylene yields in the range of 2225% were attained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, much higher over the iron zeolites prepared by post-synthesis methods (916%), with propylene selectivities around 40%."

[3] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[4] "Our results suggest that traces of well-isolated (mononuclear) Fe species released from framework positions by steaming are extremely active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to COx."

[5] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants:

1. Lower operation temperature: N2O-ODHP can be carried out at 643-773 K, which is significantly lower than the 823-923 K required for mixed metal oxide catalysts with other oxidants.

2. Higher propylene yields: Iron zeolite catalysts with N2O can achieve propylene yields of 22-25% for steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, and 9-16% for iron zeolites prepared by post-synthesis methods.

3. Improved selectivity: Propylene selectivities around 40% are achieved with iron zeolites and N2O, with some catalysts showing even higher selectivity.

Various catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP include:
- Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5
- Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by liquid-ion exchange
- Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by chemical vapor deposition
- Commercial H-ZSM-5 with iron impurities

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability:

1. Coke formation: The main cause of catalyst deactivation, leading to a decrease in propylene yield and propane conversion over time.
2. Active site poisoning: Coke deposits make active sites inaccessible by poisoning iron species.
3. Pore blockage: Coke formation can cause pore blockage in the zeolite structure.
4. Varying deactivation rates: Different catalysts exhibit different deactivation behaviors due to coking.

Strategies to address limitations and improve N2O-ODHP feasibility:

1. Optimize catalyst preparation: Focus on developing steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, which showed superior performance and resistance to deactivation.
2. Control iron loading and distribution: Promote the formation of well-isolated, mononuclear Fe species, which are more active in propylene production.
3. Enhance coke resistance: Develop catalysts with improved resistance to coking, possibly by modifying the acidity of the zeolite support.
4. Regeneration techniques: Explore efficient methods for catalyst regeneration to remove coke deposits and restore activity.
5. Process engineering: Design reactor systems that allow for continuous regeneration or easy catalyst replacement.
6. Mechanistic studies: Conduct in-depth research on the reaction mechanism to understand the role of isolated iron species and optimize their formation.
7. Explore bimetallic catalysts: Investigate the potential of adding a second metal to iron zeolites to enhance stability and selectivity.
8. Optimize reaction conditions: Fine-tune temperature, pressure, and feed composition to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propylene yields.

By addressing these challenges and implementing these strategies, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for practical implementation in propylene production.

          使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂相比其他氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 较低的操作温度：N2O-ODHP可在643-773 K下进行，显著低于使用其他氧化剂的混合金属氧化物催化剂所需的823-923 K。

2. 更高的丙烯产率：使用N2O的铁沸石催化剂可实现22-25%的丙烯产率（蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5），而后合成制备的铁沸石可达9-16%的产率。

3. 提高选择性：使用铁沸石和N2O可以达到约40%的丙烯选择性，某些催化剂甚至表现出更高的选择性。

N2O-ODHP中使用的各种催化剂包括：
- 蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5
- 液相离子交换制备的Fe-ZSM-5
- 化学气相沉积制备的Fe-ZSM-5
- 含铁杂质的商业H-ZSM-5

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战：

1. 结焦：催化剂失活的主要原因，随时间推移会降低丙烯产率和丙烷转化率。
2. 活性位点中毒：焦炭沉积会使铁物种中毒，导致活性位点无法接触。
3. 孔道堵塞：结焦可能导致沸石结构中的孔道堵塞。
4. 不同的失活速率：不同的催化剂由于结焦表现出不同的失活行为。

解决限制并提高N2O-ODHP可行性的策略：

1. 优化催化剂制备：重点开发性能更优且抗失活能力更强的蒸汽活化Fe-ZSM-5催化剂。
2. 控制铁负载量和分布：促进分散良好的单核Fe物种的形成，这些物种在丙烯生产中更加活跃。
3. 增强抗焦性：开发具有更好抗焦性的催化剂，可能通过改变沸石载体的酸性来实现。
4. 再生技术：探索有效的催化剂再生方法，去除焦炭沉积并恢复活性。
5. 过程工程：设计允许连续再生或易于更换催化剂的反应器系统。
6. 机理研究：对反应机理进行深入研究，了解单核铁物种的作用并优化其形成。
7. 探索双金属催化剂：研究向铁沸石中添加第二种金属以提高稳定性和选择性的潜力。
8. 优化反应条件：微调温度、压力和进料组成，以最大程度地减少结焦，同时保持高丙烯产率。

通过解决这些挑战并实施这些策略，N2O-ODHP可能成为丙烯生产中更加可行的实际应用选择。
