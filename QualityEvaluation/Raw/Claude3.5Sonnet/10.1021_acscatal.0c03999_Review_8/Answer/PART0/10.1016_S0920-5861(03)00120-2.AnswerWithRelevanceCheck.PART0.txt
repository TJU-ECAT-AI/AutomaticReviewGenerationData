          [1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "When N2O is added, hydroxyls decrease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interaction of N2O with NiMoO4 modifies the nature of the sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH and promoting the formation of M=O bonds."

[3] "It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissociated oxygen species O) could also participate directly as oxidant. If this is the case, the results, in particular at high N2O concentration, must thus be regarded as due to the superposition of both above described phenomena."

[4] "In fact in absence of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appreciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%) while in presence of oxygen (5% in volume (namely the same amount of oxygen atoms)), a conversion of 10% with a yield of 2.1% and a selectivity of 20.6 is observed."

[5] "The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replacement of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed clearly in DRIFTS experiments."

          N2O shows several advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O promotes a more reduced state of catalytic sites, leading to higher selectivity for propylene. This is due to N2O inhibiting O2 adsorption, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Modification of catalyst surface: N2O interaction with catalysts like NiMoO4 modifies the surface sites, decreasing OH groups and promoting M=O bonds formation. This change in surface chemistry contributes to improved selectivity.

3. Dual role: N2O can act both as an inhibitor of non-selective oxidation and as a direct oxidant through its dissociated oxygen species (O-).

4. Higher yield and selectivity: In the absence of O2, N2O produces appreciable propene yield (2.4%) with higher selectivity (28.7%) compared to O2 (2.1% yield, 20.6% selectivity).

5. Reversible effect: The effect of N2O on catalyst performance is reversible, but not instantaneous, suggesting that maintaining N2O in the feed is necessary to preserve the selective sites created during the reaction.

The main catalysts discussed in these studies include NiMoO4 (particularly the α-phase) and MoO3/SiO2. These catalysts show good performance in N2O-ODHP reactions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Maintaining the reduced state of catalytic sites over time.
2. Preventing over-oxidation of the catalyst surface.
3. Balancing the concentration of N2O to achieve optimal selectivity without compromising conversion.
4. The reversible nature of N2O effects, which may require continuous N2O presence in the feed.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Optimize N2O concentration: Further research to determine the optimal N2O concentration for balancing selectivity and conversion.

2. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain a reduced state even in the absence of N2O, potentially improving long-term stability.

3. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Conduct more in-depth studies on the exact role of N2O and the nature of oxygen species formed during the reaction.

4. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve an optimal balance of activity and selectivity.

5. Process engineering: Develop efficient methods for N2O production and recycling to make the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

6. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended durability tests to assess catalyst performance over prolonged periods and under various conditions.

7. In-situ characterization techniques: Implement methods to monitor the oxidation state of the catalyst during the reaction to better control the process.

8. Periodic operation: Explore the benefits of alternating between N2O and O2 feeds to maintain optimal catalyst performance.

These approaches could potentially overcome the challenges associated with N2O-ODHP and make it a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

          与其他氧化剂相比，N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出几个优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面：

1. 提高选择性：N2O促进催化位点处于更还原的状态，从而提高丙烯的选择性。这是由于N2O抑制O2吸附，限制了非选择性氧物种的形成。

2. 改变催化剂表面：N2O与NiMoO4等催化剂的相互作用改变了表面位点，减少OH基团并促进M=O键的形成。这种表面化学变化有助于提高选择性。

3. 双重作用：N2O既可以作为非选择性氧化的抑制剂，又可以通过其解离的氧物种（O-）直接作为氧化剂。

4. 更高的产率和选择性：在没有O2的情况下，N2O产生可观的丙烯产率（2.4%）和更高的选择性（28.7%），相比之下O2的产率为2.1%，选择性为20.6%。

5. 可逆效应：N2O对催化剂性能的影响是可逆的，但不是瞬时的，这表明在反应过程中需要维持进料中的N2O以保持所创造的选择性位点。

这些研究中讨论的主要催化剂包括NiMoO4（特别是α相）和MoO3/SiO2。这些催化剂在N2O-ODHP反应中表现出良好的性能。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 长期维持催化位点的还原状态。
2. 防止催化剂表面过度氧化。
3. 平衡N2O浓度以实现最佳选择性而不影响转化率。
4. N2O效应的可逆性质，可能需要在进料中持续存在N2O。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以考虑以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化N2O浓度：进一步研究确定最佳N2O浓度，以平衡选择性和转化率。

2. 催化剂设计：开发即使在没有N2O存在的情况下也能保持还原状态的催化剂，可能改善长期稳定性。

3. 理解反应机理：对N2O的确切作用和反应过程中形成的氧物种性质进行更深入的研究。

4. 混合氧化剂系统：研究N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用，以达到活性和选择性的最佳平衡。

5. 工艺工程：开发高效的N2O生产和回收方法，使过程更具经济可行性和环境友好性。

6. 长期稳定性研究：进行延长的耐久性测试，评估催化剂在长期和各种条件下的性能。

7. 原位表征技术：实施在反应过程中监测催化剂氧化状态的方法，以更好地控制过程。

8. 周期性操作：探索在N2O和O2供给之间交替的好处，以保持最佳催化剂性能。

这些方法可能有助于克服N2O-ODHP相关的挑战，使其成为更具吸引力的工业应用选择。
