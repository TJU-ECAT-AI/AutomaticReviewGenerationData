          [1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

[6] "This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity"

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen. N2O allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides, despite resulting in lower propane conversion. This selectivity advantage is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen, which prevents the formation of highly reactive peroxovanadates that can lead to over-oxidation of propene.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with vanadium-based catalysts being prominently featured. The ODHP reaction occurs on vanadyl groups, involving oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. N2O is responsible for reoxidizing the reduced vanadium species.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP:

1. Reduction of vanadium species: The main cause of catalyst deactivation is the reduction of surface vanadium species, which is not efficiently counteracted by N2O due to its limited ability to reoxidize these species.

2. Temperature sensitivity: Higher reaction temperatures lead to faster catalyst deactivation.

3. Conversion decline: Propane conversion decreases with time on stream.

4. Incomplete regeneration: Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O only partly restores the activity, while full restoration requires the presence of oxygen.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved resistance to reduction or enhanced ability to be reoxidized by N2O.

2. Reaction conditions optimization: Find optimal temperature and pressure conditions that balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.

3. Regeneration protocols: Optimize regeneration procedures, possibly using a combination of N2O and oxygen to fully restore catalyst activity.

4. Support material engineering: Investigate support materials that can stabilize the active vanadium species or facilitate their reoxidation.

5. Promoter addition: Study the effect of promoters that could enhance N2O's ability to reoxidize the catalyst without compromising selectivity.

6. Reactor design: Develop reactor configurations that allow for continuous or cyclic regeneration of the catalyst without interrupting the process.

7. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth research on the reaction mechanism to better understand and control the factors affecting catalyst deactivation.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

          在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂（特别是氧气）在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势。尽管导致较低的丙烷转化率，N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性和更低的碳氧化物选择性。这种选择性优势归因于N2O相比氧气重新氧化还原态钒物种的能力较弱，从而防止形成高反应性的过氧钒酸盐，这些过氧钒酸盐可能导致丙烯的过度氧化。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中钒基催化剂最为突出。ODHP反应发生在钒酰基团上，涉及氧的移除和随后的钒还原。N2O负责重新氧化还原的钒物种。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临着与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战：

1. 钒物种的还原：催化剂失活的主要原因是表面钒物种的还原，由于N2O重新氧化这些物种的能力有限，无法有效地对抗这一问题。

2. 温度敏感性：更高的反应温度导致更快的催化剂失活。

3. 转化率下降：丙烷转化率随反应时间的延长而降低。

4. 不完全再生：通过在N2O下加热再生催化剂只能部分恢复活性，而完全恢复需要氧气的存在。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以探索以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有更强抗还原能力或enhanced被N2O重新氧化能力的催化剂。

2. 反应条件优化：找到平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性的最佳温度和压力条件。

3. 再生协议：优化再生程序，可能将N2O与氧气结合使用，以完全恢复催化剂活性。

4. 载体材料工程：研究能够稳定活性钒物种或促进其重新氧化的载体材料。

5. 助剂添加：研究可以增强N2O重新氧化催化剂能力而不影响选择性的助剂效果。

6. 反应器设计：开发允许在不中断过程的情况下连续或循环再生催化剂的反应器配置。

7. 机理研究：对反应机理进行更深入的研究，以更好地理解和控制影响催化剂失活的因素。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择。
