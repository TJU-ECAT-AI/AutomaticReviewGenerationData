          [1] "Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O. 8,18"

[5] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 2025% at 723773 K. Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites."

[6] "The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration. On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated."

[7] "This novel process presents an attractive alternative for the production of moderate (on-purpose) propylene volumes in localized sites having a low-cost source of N2O with a sufficient purity, in view of the detrimental effect of gases such as O2 or NO on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe-zeolites."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O allows for higher propene yields, with initial yields reaching up to 25% over steam-activated FeZSM-5 catalysts. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported for V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as the oxidant.

The most promising catalysts for N2O-ODHP are iron zeolites, particularly steam-activated FeZSM-5. These catalysts show remarkable performance, achieving initial propene yields in the range of 20-25% at temperatures between 723-773 K. In contrast, when O2 is used as the oxidant with FeZSM-5, the propylene yields are very low (<5%).

The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP are catalyst deactivation and stability. The main drawback is rapid deactivation due to coke formation, which leads to a decrease in propene yield over time. This is a significant hurdle for the practical implementation of the process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Cyclic regeneration process: A cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated, alternating between reaction and regeneration steps. This approach allows for the recovery of initial catalyst activity through air-regeneration.

2. Optimization of reaction conditions: Further research could focus on optimizing reaction temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene yields.

3. Catalyst modification: Developing new catalyst formulations or modifying existing ones to enhance resistance to coke formation and improve stability.

4. N2O purification: Since the presence of O2 and NO is detrimental to the process, developing efficient methods for purifying N2O from industrial waste streams could make the process more economically viable.

5. Alternative N2O sources: Investigating the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O could provide a more cost-effective and pure source of N2O.

6. Process integration: Exploring opportunities to integrate N2O-ODHP with industrial processes that produce N2O as a by-product, creating a more sustainable and economical approach to propylene production.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of catalyst deactivation and N2O availability, potentially making N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation in the production of moderate volumes of on-purpose propylene.

          一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，相比其他氧化剂显示出显著的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O可以获得更高的丙烯产率，在蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5催化剂上初始产率可达25%。这一性能与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

N2O-ODHP最有前景的催化剂是铁沸石，特别是蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5。这些催化剂显示出卓越的性能，在723-773 K的温度范围内可实现20-25%的初始丙烯产率。相比之下，当使用O2作为FeZSM-5的氧化剂时，丙烯产率非常低（<5%）。

N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是催化剂失活和稳定性。主要缺点是由于积碳形成导致的快速失活，这会导致丙烯产率随时间降低。这是该工艺实际应用的一个重大障碍。

为了解决这些局限性并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几种策略和研究方向：

1. 循环再生过程：已经证明了一种用于连续丙烯生产的循环过程，在反应和再生步骤之间交替进行。这种方法通过空气再生允许恢复催化剂的初始活性。

2. 优化反应条件：进一步研究可以集中在优化反应温度、压力和反应物比例，以最小化积碳形成，同时保持高丙烯产率。

3. 催化剂改性：开发新的催化剂配方或修改现有配方，以增强对积碳形成的抗性并提高稳定性。

4. N2O纯化：由于O2和NO的存在对该过程有害，开发从工业废气流中纯化N2O的有效方法可以使该过程在经济上更可行。

5. 替代N2O来源：研究开发用于低温NH3氧化生成N2O的廉价和选择性催化剂系统，可以提供更具成本效益和纯度的N2O来源。

6. 工艺集成：探索将N2O-ODHP与产生N2O作为副产品的工业过程集成的机会，为丙烯生产创造一种更可持续和经济的方法。

这些策略旨在解决催化剂失活和N2O可用性的主要挑战，有可能使N2O-ODHP成为一种更可行的选择，用于实际实施中等规模的定向丙烯生产。
