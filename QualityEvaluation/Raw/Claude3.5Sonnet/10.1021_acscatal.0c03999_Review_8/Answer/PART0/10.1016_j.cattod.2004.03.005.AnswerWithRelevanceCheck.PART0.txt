          [1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "N2O inhibits such oxidation, promoting the reduction to Mo5+. CO2 increases conversion and, thus, favours non selectivity; on the contrary, N2O decreases conversion and increases selectivity."

[3] "Taking these results into account, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."

[4] "These results support the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase, which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed."

[5] "We have suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts [3,4]. This would account for the decrease in propane conversion, in O2 consumption and in the yield in CO2 observed in the mixture."

[6] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces: (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%)."

[7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O promotes higher selectivity to propylene while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as reducing CO2 yield.

2. Promotion of catalyst reduction: N2O facilitates the reduction of molybdenum on the catalyst surface, particularly to Mo5+. This reduced state of the catalyst is associated with improved selectivity.

3. Oxygen adsorption inhibition: N2O appears to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst (e.g., NiMoO4), which promotes reduction and helps maintain the catalyst in a more selective state.

4. Controlled oxidation state: The addition of N2O as a gas dope in the feed allows for better control of the oxidation state of the catalyst surface atoms, which is crucial for increasing selectivity.

The catalysts employed in this process include:

1. NiMoO4: Pure nickel molybdate catalysts show improved selectivity with N2O addition.

2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4 mixture: This biphasic catalyst system demonstrates enhanced selectivity, with α-Sb2O4 controlling the number of selective sites.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Surface area loss: The specific area of NiMoO4 drops significantly after catalytic reactions, which could impact long-term stability.

2. Maintaining optimal reduction state: Ensuring the catalyst remains in the ideal reduced state (e.g., Mo5+) without over-reduction is challenging.

3. Balancing selectivity and conversion: While N2O improves selectivity, it also decreases overall conversion, which may impact process efficiency.

Strategies and research directions to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation include:

1. Catalyst design optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain their reduced state and surface area over longer periods, possibly by incorporating stabilizing elements or structures.

2. Oxidant mixture optimization: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance selectivity and conversion.

3. In-situ regeneration: Explore methods to regenerate the catalyst during operation to maintain its optimal state.

4. Support material research: Investigate alternative support materials that can enhance catalyst stability and promote the desired oxidation state.

5. Process engineering improvements: Develop reactor designs that can better control the oxidation state of the catalyst throughout the reaction.

6. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth research to fully understand the role of N2O in the reaction mechanism, which could lead to more targeted catalyst improvements.

7. Promoter investigation: Study the effects of various promoters that could work synergistically with N2O to enhance both selectivity and stability.

8. Fine-tuning N2O concentration: Optimize the amount of N2O in the feed to balance selectivity improvements with catalyst stability and overall conversion.

9. Advanced characterization techniques: Utilize operando spectroscopy and other advanced techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state during the reaction, informing further improvements.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible option for practical implementation in propylene production.

          一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有以下优势：

1. 提高选择性：N2O提高了丙烯的选择性，同时降低了丙烷和氧气的转化率，以及CO2的产率。

2. 促进催化剂还原：N2O促进催化剂表面钼的还原，特别是还原为Mo5+。这种催化剂的还原状态与提高的选择性相关。

3. 抑制氧气吸附：N2O似乎抑制了氧气在催化剂（如NiMoO4）上的吸附，这促进了还原并有助于保持催化剂处于更具选择性的状态。

4. 控制氧化态：在反应气体中添加N2O作为掺杂气体可以更好地控制催化剂表面原子的氧化态，这对提高选择性至关重要。

该过程中使用的催化剂包括：

1. NiMoO4：纯镍钼酸盐催化剂在添加N2O后显示出改善的选择性。

2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4混合物：这种双相催化剂系统表现出增强的选择性，其中α-Sb2O4控制选择性位点的数量。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 比表面积损失：NiMoO4的比表面积在催化反应后显著下降，这可能影响长期稳定性。

2. 维持最佳还原态：确保催化剂保持在理想的还原态（如Mo5+）而不过度还原是具有挑战性的。

3. 平衡选择性和转化率：虽然N2O提高了选择性，但也降低了整体转化率，这可能影响过程效率。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际应用选择，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂设计：开发能够长期保持还原态和比表面积的催化剂，可能通过引入稳定元素或结构。
