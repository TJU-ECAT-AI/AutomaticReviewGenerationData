          [1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation. In this case, development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

[6] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[7] "The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows promising performance as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), offering several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity:

1. High propylene yields: Steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as an oxidant can achieve propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2.

2. Higher space velocity: The experiments with N2O demonstrate space velocities an order of magnitude higher than typically reported, indicating superior performance of steamed iron zeolites.

3. Potential for simultaneous N2O mitigation: The process could potentially help reduce N2O emissions while producing valuable propylene.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process:

1. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites with MFI (e.g., FeZSM-5) and BEA frameworks
2. Ex-Fe-silicalite
3. Commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA zeolites containing trace amounts of iron

The catalytic activity is attributed to extraframework iron species generated during steam treatment.

Critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include:

1. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation: This is the major drawback of the process.
2. Varying deactivation behavior among catalysts: 
   - BEA framework catalysts (ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA) show rapid and complete deactivation due to large cavities with small apertures that trap coke precursors.
   - MFI framework catalysts (ex-FeZSM-5) demonstrate better resistance to deactivation, likely due to mesopores formed during steam treatment.

To address these limitations and improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP, several strategies and research directions are proposed:

1. Catalyst design optimization: 
   - Focus on developing zeolite structures with optimal pore sizes and distributions to minimize coke formation and improve stability.
   - Investigate the optimal distribution and nature of iron species in the zeolite framework.

2. Mesopore introduction: 
   - Explore methods like desilication to create mesopores in zeolites, enhancing transport properties and active site accessibility.

3. Regeneration strategies: 
   - Optimize regeneration processes to efficiently remove coke and restore catalyst activity, as high initial activity can be recovered by regenerating coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K.

4. Advanced characterization: 
   - Utilize techniques like TEOM for simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking to better understand deactivation mechanisms and guide catalyst improvement.

5. Process engineering: 
   - Explore innovative reactor designs or operating conditions to minimize coke formation and extend catalyst lifetime.

6. Bimetallic catalysts: 
   - Investigate the use of bimetallic systems to potentially improve both activity and stability.

7. Combining N2O with other oxidants: 
   - Explore the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants like O2 for potential synergistic effects.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for practical implementation in propylene production.

          一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂展现出良好的性能，在丙烯选择性方面提供了几个优势：

1. 高丙烯产率：使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石在723 K下可达到高达25%的丙烯产率，与使用O2的最先进催化剂相当。

2. 更高的空速：与N2O的实验显示出比通常报道的高一个数量级的空速，表明蒸汽活化铁沸石的性能优越。

3. 同时减少N2O排放的潜力：该过程可能有助于在生产有价值的丙烯的同时减少N2O排放。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂：

1. 具有MFI（如FeZSM-5）和BEA骨架的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石
2. Ex-Fe-硅石
3. 含微量铁的商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA沸石

催化活性归因于蒸汽处理过程中产生的骨架外铁物种。

N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战包括：

1. 由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活：这是该过程的主要缺点。
2. 不同催化剂之间的失活行为差异：
   - BEA骨架催化剂（ex-FeBEA和ex-H-BEA）由于具有小孔径的大腔体而导致积碳前体物被捕获，显示出快速且完全的失活。
   - MFI骨架催化剂（ex-FeZSM-5）表现出更好的抗失活能力，可能是由于蒸汽处理过程中形成的介孔。

为了解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的可行性，提出了几个策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计优化：
   - 专注于开发具有最佳孔径和分布的沸石结构，以最小化积碳形成并提高稳定性。
   - 研究沸石骨架中铁物种的最佳分布和性质。

2. 介孔引入：
   - 探索如脱硅等方法在沸石中创造介孔，增强传输性质和活性位点可及性。

3. 再生策略：
   - 优化再生过程，以有效去除积碳并恢复催化剂活性，因为在773 K下用氧气再生积碳的沸石可以恢复高初始活性。

4. 先进表征：
   - 利用TEOM等技术同时测量反应和积碳，以更好地理解失活机理并指导催化剂改进。

5. 工艺工程：
   - 探索创新的反应器设计或操作条件，以最小化积碳形成并延长催化剂寿命。

6. 双金属催化剂：
   - 研究双金属系统的使用，以潜在地提高活性和稳定性。

7. 将N2O与其他氧化剂结合：
   - 探索N2O与其他氧化剂（如O2）结合使用，以获得潜在的协同效应。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际应用选择。
