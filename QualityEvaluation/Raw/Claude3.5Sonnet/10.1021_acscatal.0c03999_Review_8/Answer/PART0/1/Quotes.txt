[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "When N2O is added, hydroxyls decrease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interaction of N2O with NiMoO4 modifies the nature of the sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH and promoting the formation of M=O bonds."

[3] "It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissociated oxygen species O) could also participate directly as oxidant. If this is the case, the results, in particular at high N2O concentration, must thus be regarded as due to the superposition of both above described phenomena."

[4] "In fact in absence of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appreciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%) while in presence of oxygen (5% in volume (namely the same amount of oxygen atoms)), a conversion of 10% with a yield of 2.1% and a selectivity of 20.6 is observed."

[5] "The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replacement of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed clearly in DRIFTS experiments."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites."

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%. These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2 as the oxidant"

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propylene yield"

[4] "Deactivation of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species."

[5] "Our results demonstrate for the first time that the regeneration of iron-containing zeolites in N2O-mediated selective oxidations is not fully reversible."

[6] "Appropriate strategies for catalyst regeneration should be designed to avoid modification of the iron speciation on coke removal leading to diminished ODHP performance."

[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "Propylene yields in the range of 2225% were attained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, much higher over the iron zeolites prepared by post-synthesis methods (916%), with propylene selectivities around 40%."

[3] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[4] "Our results suggest that traces of well-isolated (mononuclear) Fe species released from framework positions by steaming are extremely active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to COx."

[5] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."

"On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."

          "N2O, (15) and CO2 (16) have been tested respectively. CO2 with ceria-based catalyst increased the ethylene selectivity in the ethane ODH reaction to about 60% but a much higher reaction temperature was required because of the low activity of CO2. (16) On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."

"It is known that the interaction of N2O with ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely active surface oxygen species discovered by Ref. [1] which was called α-oxygen [2]."

"The α-oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethylene with 96–98% selectivity; it reacts with methane at ambient temperatures to give methanol or converts benzene to phenol at moderate temperatures."

"Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85–95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen."

[8] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

[2] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[3] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[4] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

[5] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non-selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

"C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

"Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

"The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

"Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation"

"High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to 5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is due to lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3."

[1] "Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O. 8,18"

[5] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 2025% at 723773 K. Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites."

[6] "The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration. On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated."

[7] "This novel process presents an attractive alternative for the production of moderate (on-purpose) propylene volumes in localized sites having a low-cost source of N2O with a sufficient purity, in view of the detrimental effect of gases such as O2 or NO on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe-zeolites."

[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "It has been shown that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen [5,10]. The explanation proposed to explain these results is based on the fact that N2O is dissociated into N2 and atomic oxygen, being responsible of the higher selectivity [5,7,11]."

[4] "Comparing Tests T 5% O2 and T 0% O2 + 10% N2O (namely, both tests containing the same oxygen in the feed), it is concluded that in presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7% compared with 20.6%, respectively)."

[5] "When the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower."

[6] "However, the situation is more complex. Under a high N2O concentration, the catalyst is deeply reduced and a big amount of carbonaceous products is simultaneously formed. On the other hand, too reduced catalysts are less active for propane transformation."

[7] "These observations show that, the good performance observed in the formation of propylene from propane with pure N2O is probably not stable on time and that the catalysts would be further deactivated with time on stream."

[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]."

[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."

[3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[4] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."

[6] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[3] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.6–9.5% wt.%)."

[4] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide."

[5] "Therefore, the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant."

[6] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[4] "From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities."

[5] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2."

[6] "Highly dispersed VOx species, which can be classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, are present in materials with a vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% under conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and are independent of the preparation method."

[7] "For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxidation over a combustion reaction."

[1] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7)."

[2] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

[3] "The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

[4] "It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[5] "For all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds. When the oxygen partial pressure decreases from 20 to 10 kPa, the initial propene selectivity increases and is close to that with 40 kPa of N2O."

[6] "However, the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation is not influenced by the oxygen partial pressures. Consecutive propene oxidation is significantly lower when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[7] "It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."

[8] "Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O."

[1] "Superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48"

[2] "N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This property of N2O is very essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx (mainly to CO)."

[3] "Propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion. This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[6] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment. As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

[7] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

[8] "It is concluded that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples. This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."

[9] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[10] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too. The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found: VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 > VOx(2.8)/SiO2 > VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 > VOx(2.7)/MCM-41"

[1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "N2O inhibits such oxidation, promoting the reduction to Mo5+. CO2 increases conversion and, thus, favours non selectivity; on the contrary, N2O decreases conversion and increases selectivity."

[3] "Taking these results into account, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."

[4] "These results support the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase, which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed."

[5] "We have suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts [3,4]. This would account for the decrease in propane conversion, in O2 consumption and in the yield in CO2 observed in the mixture."

[6] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces: (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%)."

[7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."

[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation. In this case, development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

[6] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[7] "The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

[6] "This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity"

[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "When N2O is added, hydroxyls decrease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interaction of N2O with NiMoO4 modifies the nature of the sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH and promoting the formation of M=O bonds."

[3] "It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissociated oxygen species O) could also participate directly as oxidant. If this is the case, the results, in particular at high N2O concentration, must thus be regarded as due to the superposition of both above described phenomena."

[4] "In fact in absence of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appreciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%) while in presence of oxygen (5% in volume (namely the same amount of oxygen atoms)), a conversion of 10% with a yield of 2.1% and a selectivity of 20.6 is observed."

[5] "The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replacement of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed clearly in DRIFTS experiments."

[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

[1] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[2] "This reaction leads to the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[3] "The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6 yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the specificity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reaction over Fe-zeolites."

[5] "We have investigated the effect of adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mixture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at 723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production)."

[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%. These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2 as the oxidant"

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propylene yield"

[4] "Deactivation of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species."

[5] "Our results demonstrate for the first time that the regeneration of iron-containing zeolites in N2O-mediated selective oxidations is not fully reversible."

[6] "Appropriate strategies for catalyst regeneration should be designed to avoid modification of the iron speciation on coke removal leading to diminished ODHP performance."

[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "Propylene yields in the range of 2225% were attained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, much higher over the iron zeolites prepared by post-synthesis methods (916%), with propylene selectivities around 40%."

[3] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[4] "Our results suggest that traces of well-isolated (mononuclear) Fe species released from framework positions by steaming are extremely active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to COx."

[5] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."

"On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."

          "N2O, (15) and CO2 (16) have been tested respectively. CO2 with ceria-based catalyst increased the ethylene selectivity in the ethane ODH reaction to about 60% but a much higher reaction temperature was required because of the low activity of CO2. (16) On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%)."

"It is known that the interaction of N2O with ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely active surface oxygen species discovered by Ref. [1] which was called α-oxygen [2]."

"The α-oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethylene with 96–98% selectivity; it reacts with methane at ambient temperatures to give methanol or converts benzene to phenol at moderate temperatures."

"Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85–95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst."

[1] "Using N2O as an oxidant instead of oxygen results in a significant increase in propylene selectivity for many different catalysts, including iron-containing zeolites and vanadium-based catalysts."

[2] "While iron-based materials, such as Fe-ZSM-5, are found to be the catalysts that give the highest C3H6 yield for ODHP using N2O, other catalysts, including redox metal catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum, have been studied as well."

[3] "However, despite the improved propylene selectivity, most of N2OODHP catalysts reported to date deactivate quickly, mainly because of coke formation, making N2O a currently less feasible oxidant than other soft oxidants, such as CO2."

[4] "For example, Baerns et al. show that a significant increase in C3H6 selectivity from 55% to 75% can be obtained by using N2O instead of O2 as an oxidant for 0.5% VOx/γ-Al2O3."

[5] "Such improved C3H6 selectivity using N2O is attributed to the lesser ability of N2O to oxidize reduced VOx species."

[6] "Molybdenum catalysts also show decreased C3H8 conversion and increased C3H6 selectivity upon addition of N2O during C3H8 dehydrogenation."

[7] "Combining the observations made from XPS and DRIFTS, Ruiz et al. assert that while both oxygen and N2O are able to interact with the surface hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, N2O stabilizes molybdenum in a more reduced state on nickel molybdate compared to molecular oxygen."

[8] "Therefore, improvement in catalyst stability and clear understanding of deactivation mechanisms remain challenges that need further study in the dehydrogenation of propane using N2O."

[1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

[2] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[3] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[4] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

[5] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non-selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

"C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

"Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

"The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

"Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation"

"High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to 5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is due to lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3."

[1] "Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O. 8,18"

[5] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 2025% at 723773 K. Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites."

[6] "The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration. On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated."

[7] "This novel process presents an attractive alternative for the production of moderate (on-purpose) propylene volumes in localized sites having a low-cost source of N2O with a sufficient purity, in view of the detrimental effect of gases such as O2 or NO on the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe-zeolites."

[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "It has been shown that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen [5,10]. The explanation proposed to explain these results is based on the fact that N2O is dissociated into N2 and atomic oxygen, being responsible of the higher selectivity [5,7,11]."

[4] "Comparing Tests T 5% O2 and T 0% O2 + 10% N2O (namely, both tests containing the same oxygen in the feed), it is concluded that in presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7% compared with 20.6%, respectively)."

[5] "When the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower."

[6] "However, the situation is more complex. Under a high N2O concentration, the catalyst is deeply reduced and a big amount of carbonaceous products is simultaneously formed. On the other hand, too reduced catalysts are less active for propane transformation."

[7] "These observations show that, the good performance observed in the formation of propylene from propane with pure N2O is probably not stable on time and that the catalysts would be further deactivated with time on stream."

[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]."

[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."

[3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[4] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."

[6] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[3] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.6–9.5% wt.%)."

[4] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide."

[5] "Therefore, the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant."

[6] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[4] "From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities."

[5] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2."

[6] "Highly dispersed VOx species, which can be classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, are present in materials with a vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% under conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and are independent of the preparation method."

[7] "For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxidation over a combustion reaction."

[1] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7)."

[2] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

[3] "The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

[4] "It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[5] "For all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds. When the oxygen partial pressure decreases from 20 to 10 kPa, the initial propene selectivity increases and is close to that with 40 kPa of N2O."

[6] "However, the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation is not influenced by the oxygen partial pressures. Consecutive propene oxidation is significantly lower when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[7] "It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."

[8] "Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O."

[1] "Superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48"

[2] "N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This property of N2O is very essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx (mainly to CO)."

[3] "Propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion. This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[6] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment. As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

[7] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

[8] "It is concluded that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples. This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."

[9] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[10] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too. The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found: VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 > VOx(2.8)/SiO2 > VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 > VOx(2.7)/MCM-41"

[1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "N2O inhibits such oxidation, promoting the reduction to Mo5+. CO2 increases conversion and, thus, favours non selectivity; on the contrary, N2O decreases conversion and increases selectivity."

[3] "Taking these results into account, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."

[4] "These results support the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase, which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed."

[5] "We have suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts [3,4]. This would account for the decrease in propane conversion, in O2 consumption and in the yield in CO2 observed in the mixture."

[6] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces: (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%)."

[7] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."

[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation. In this case, development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

[6] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[7] "The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

[6] "This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity"
