          [1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "It has been shown that N2O is more selective than molecular oxygen [5,10]. The explanation proposed to explain these results is based on the fact that N2O is dissociated into N2 and atomic oxygen, being responsible of the higher selectivity [5,7,11]."

[4] "Comparing Tests T 5% O2 and T 0% O2 + 10% N2O (namely, both tests containing the same oxygen in the feed), it is concluded that in presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7% compared with 20.6%, respectively)."

[5] "When the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower."

[6] "However, the situation is more complex. Under a high N2O concentration, the catalyst is deeply reduced and a big amount of carbonaceous products is simultaneously formed. On the other hand, too reduced catalysts are less active for propane transformation."

[7] "These observations show that, the good performance observed in the formation of propylene from propane with pure N2O is probably not stable on time and that the catalysts would be further deactivated with time on stream."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly molecular oxygen:

1. Improved selectivity: N2O demonstrates higher selectivity for propylene production compared to molecular oxygen. This is attributed to N2O's dissociation into N2 and atomic oxygen, which is believed to be responsible for the increased selectivity.

2. Enhanced yield: At low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O increases the yield of propylene while decreasing propane conversion.

3. Reduced CO2 formation: When using N2O as an oxidant, especially at higher concentrations (10%), the yield and selectivity towards CO2 are significantly lower compared to using molecular oxygen.

4. Modulation of catalyst oxidation state: N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface, which can lead to improved catalyst performance at lower concentrations.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate (NiMoO4). The research shows that the performance of this catalyst can be modulated by adjusting the N2O concentration in the feed.

However, there are critical challenges associated with using N2O in ODHP:

1. Catalyst deactivation: At higher N2O concentrations, the catalyst becomes deeply reduced, leading to the formation of carbonaceous products and potential deactivation over time.

2. Stability issues: The good performance observed with pure N2O is likely not stable over extended periods, as the catalyst may continue to deactivate with time on stream.

3. Complex reaction dynamics: The optimal N2O concentration is crucial, as too little may not provide sufficient benefits, while too much can lead to over-reduction of the catalyst and decreased activity for propane transformation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to deep reduction and carbonaceous product formation while maintaining high selectivity for propylene.

2. Optimized N2O concentrations: Further research to determine the optimal N2O concentration that balances improved selectivity with catalyst stability.

3. Mixed oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants (e.g., O2 or CO2) to achieve a balance between selectivity and catalyst stability.

4. In-situ catalyst regeneration: Develop methods for periodic or continuous regeneration of the catalyst to maintain its activity and selectivity over extended periods.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth research on the reaction mechanisms and catalyst surface interactions to better understand and control the reduction processes induced by N2O.

6. Novel reactor designs: Explore reactor configurations that could help maintain optimal catalyst oxidation states and mitigate deactivation issues.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the potential of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP could be more fully realized, potentially leading to more efficient and selective propylene production processes.

          与其他氧化剂相比，一氧化二氮（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中作为氧化剂显示出几个优势，特别是与分子氧相比：

1. 提高选择性：与分子氧相比，N2O对丙烯生产表现出更高的选择性。这归因于N2O分解成N2和原子氧，被认为是提高选择性的原因。

2. 提高产率：在低浓度（300 ppm）下，N2O增加了丙烯的产率，同时降低了丙烷的转化率。

3. 减少CO2生成：使用N2O作为氧化剂时，特别是在较高浓度（10%）下，CO2的产率和选择性显著低于使用分子氧时。

4. 调节催化剂氧化态：N2O诱导催化剂表面Mo的还原，在较低浓度下可以导致催化剂性能的改善。

本研究讨论的主要催化剂是钼酸镍（NiMoO4）。研究表明，通过调整进料中N2O的浓度，可以调节该催化剂的性能。

然而，在ODHP中使用N2O存在一些关键挑战：

1. 催化剂失活：在较高的N2O浓度下，催化剂会深度还原，导致碳质产物的形成和潜在的随时间失活。

2. 稳定性问题：纯N2O条件下观察到的良好性能可能在长期内不稳定，因为催化剂可能随着反应时间的推移继续失活。

3. 复杂的反应动力学：最佳N2O浓度至关重要，因为浓度过低可能不会提供足够的益处，而浓度过高可能导致催化剂过度还原和丙烷转化活性降低。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发对深度还原和碳质产物形成更具抗性的催化剂，同时保持对丙烯的高选择性。

2. 优化N2O浓度：进一步研究确定最佳N2O浓度，平衡提高的选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 混合氧化剂系统：研究N2O与其他氧化剂（如O2或CO2）组合使用，以在选择性和催化剂稳定性之间取得平衡。

4. 原位催化剂再生：开发周期性或连续再生催化剂的方法，以长期保持其活性和选择性。

5. 机理研究：对反应机理和催化剂表面相互作用进行更深入的研究，以更好地理解和控制N2O诱导的还原过程。

6. 新型反应器设计：探索能够帮助维持最佳催化剂氧化态并减缓失活问题的反应器配置。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O作为ODHP氧化剂的潜力可能得到更充分的实现，有望带来更高效和选择性的丙烯生产工艺。
