          [1] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7)."

[2] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

[3] "The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

[4] "It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[5] "For all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds. When the oxygen partial pressure decreases from 20 to 10 kPa, the initial propene selectivity increases and is close to that with 40 kPa of N2O."

[6] "However, the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation is not influenced by the oxygen partial pressures. Consecutive propene oxidation is significantly lower when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[7] "It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."

[8] "Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O leads to improved initial propylene selectivity compared to O2. This is attributed to the reduced direct propane oxidation to CO and CO2, as well as decreased consecutive propylene oxidation to COx.

2. Lower oxidation state of vanadium: N2O results in a lower average oxidation state of bulk and near-surface vanadium after the ODP reaction, ranging between +3.9 and +4.4. This reduced state of vanadium is associated with higher propylene selectivity.

3. Different oxygen species: The nature of oxygen species originating from N2O differs from those from O2, potentially playing a role in reducing consecutive propylene oxidation and direct propane oxidation.

4. Lower re-oxidation ability: N2O has a lower ability to re-oxidize reduced vanadium oxide species compared to O2, which contributes to maintaining the catalyst in a more reduced state.

5. Improved performance of vanadium oxide catalysts: Some vanadium oxide catalysts that perform poorly with O2 become selective when using N2O as the oxidant.

6. Partial pressure effects: When using O2, decreasing the oxygen partial pressure from 20 to 10 kPa increases the initial propene selectivity, approaching that achieved with 40 kPa of N2O.

The study primarily focused on individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) as catalysts for the N2O-ODHP process. These catalysts showed improved performance with N2O compared to O2, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity and reduced consecutive oxidation.

          在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比氧气（O2）在丙烯选择性方面具有以下几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：与O2相比，N2O可以提高初始丙烯选择性。这是由于直接丙烷氧化生成CO和CO2的反应减少，以及连续丙烯氧化生成COx的反应也减少。

2. 钒的氧化态较低：使用N2O后，ODP反应后体相和近表面钒的平均氧化态降低到+3.9至+4.4之间。钒的这种还原态与更高的丙烯选择性相关。

3. 不同的氧物种：源自N2O的氧物种的性质与O2不同，可能在减少连续丙烯氧化和直接丙烷氧化方面起作用。

4. 较低的再氧化能力：与O2相比，N2O重新氧化还原态钒氧化物物种的能力较低，这有助于保持催化剂处于更还原的状态。

5. 改善钒氧化物催化剂的性能：某些在O2中表现不佳的钒氧化物催化剂在使用N2O作为氧化剂时变得具有选择性。

6. 分压效应：使用O2时，将氧分压从20 kPa降低到10 kPa会提高初始丙烯选择性，接近于使用40 kPa N2O时的效果。

该研究主要关注了单一钒氧化物（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）作为N2O-ODHP过程的催化剂。这些催化剂在使用N2O时比使用O2时表现更好，特别是在丙烯选择性和减少连续氧化方面。

          The study primarily focused on vanadium-based catalysts (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts undergo significant restructuring under reaction conditions, with their final composition determined by the oxidizing agent used.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the study mentions reaction-induced changes in the catalysts, which could potentially impact long-term stability.

          The study primarily focused on vanadium-based catalysts, specifically V2O3, VO2, and V2O5, for the N2O-ODHP process. These catalysts showed dynamic changes in their oxidation states and surface compositions under reaction conditions.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process, it does mention reaction-induced changes in the catalysts. These changes could potentially impact long-term stability and performance of the catalysts.

To address potential limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop more stable vanadium-based catalysts or explore other metal oxide catalysts that maintain their reduced state under N2O-ODHP conditions.

2. Reaction condition optimization: Investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene yield.

3. Catalyst regeneration methods: Develop efficient techniques to regenerate the catalyst and maintain its activity over extended periods.

4. Support material research: Explore various support materials that can enhance the stability and selectivity of the active vanadium species.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth investigations into the reaction mechanism of N2O-ODHP to better understand and control the factors affecting catalyst stability and selectivity.

6. Process integration: Investigate the potential for integrating N2O-ODHP with other processes to improve overall efficiency and economic viability.

7. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended stability tests to identify and address factors contributing to catalyst deactivation over time.

8. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts: Investigate the use of mixed-metal oxide catalysts or supported vanadium catalysts to enhance stability and selectivity.

9. In-situ characterization: Develop and utilize advanced in-situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst structure and composition under reaction conditions.

10. Theoretical modeling: Use computational modeling to predict catalyst behavior and guide the design of more stable and selective catalysts for N2O-ODHP.

These research directions could help overcome the limitations of the N2O-ODHP process and potentially make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.
