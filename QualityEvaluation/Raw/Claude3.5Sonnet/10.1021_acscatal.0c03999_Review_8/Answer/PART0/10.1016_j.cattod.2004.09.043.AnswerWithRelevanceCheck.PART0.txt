          [1] "Results obtained by adding gaseous promoters (CO2, N2O and H2) into the reaction feed are presented for two different reactions: (i) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), and (ii) catalytic combustion of methane (CCM)."

[2] "From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively), and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%, respectively)."

[3] "The important improvement in the selectivity due to the addition of N2O opens wide perspectives for the application of selective mesoporous catalysts."

[4] "Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O, otherwise the catalyst deactivates quickly. N2O reduces the catalysts (molybdenum), explaining the high carbon formation."

[5] "These results strongly suggest that: (i) a potential role of N2O in the presence of NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst is to inhibit the non-selective sites, (ii) the formation of propylene by using pure N2O is very low, and (iii) it is the presence of both O2 and N2O (as promoter) that can fully explain the better selectivity of the catalysts in ODP, due to the modulation of their adequate oxidation state during the reaction."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. The addition of N2O (1-5 vol%) leads to a substantial increase in selectivity (up to 141%) and yield (up to 22%) of propylene, despite a decrease in overall propane conversion. This improvement in selectivity is attributed to N2O's ability to inhibit non-selective sites on the catalyst surface.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with a focus on NiMoO4-based catalysts supported on mesoporous materials like [Si,V]-MCM-41. These catalysts show promising results when used in conjunction with N2O as a promoter.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability:
1. Carbon deposition: N2O reduces the catalysts (particularly molybdenum), leading to high carbon formation and subsequent deactivation.
2. Catalyst regeneration: Molecular oxygen is necessary to oxidize and regenerate the catalysts in the presence of N2O. Without O2, the catalyst deactivates quickly.
3. Conversion-selectivity trade-off: While N2O improves selectivity, it also leads to a significant decrease in conversion, which may limit overall productivity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimizing the ratio of N2O to O2: Finding the right balance between N2O (for selectivity) and O2 (for catalyst regeneration) could maximize propylene yield while maintaining catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to reduction by N2O could help maintain activity over longer periods.

3. Periodic regeneration: Implementing a cyclic process where the catalyst is periodically exposed to higher O2 concentrations could help maintain its activity.

4. Exploring bimetallic or multi-component catalysts: These might offer better resistance to deactivation while maintaining the selectivity benefits of N2O.

5. In-situ characterization studies: Conducting more detailed investigations of the catalyst surface during reaction could provide insights into the mechanisms of deactivation and guide catalyst design.

6. Process engineering: Developing reactor designs that allow for better control of the oxidation state of the catalyst throughout the reaction could help maintain optimal performance.

By addressing these challenges through focused research efforts, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

          在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。添加N2O（1-5体积%）可以显著提高丙烯的选择性（高达141%）和产率（高达22%），尽管总体丙烷转化率有所下降。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O抑制催化剂表面非选择性位点的能力。

这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，主要集中在负载在[Si,V]-MCM-41等介孔材料上的NiMoO4基催化剂。这些催化剂与N2O作为促进剂一起使用时显示出良好的效果。

然而，与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：
1. 碳沉积：N2O还原催化剂（特别是钼），导致高碳形成和随后的失活。
2. 催化剂再生：在N2O存在的情况下，需要分子氧来氧化和再生催化剂。没有O2，催化剂会快速失活。
3. 转化率-选择性权衡：虽然N2O提高了选择性，但也导致转化率显著下降，可能限制整体生产力。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O与O2的比例：找到N2O（提高选择性）和O2（催化剂再生）之间的适当平衡，可以在保持催化剂稳定性的同时最大化丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂设计：开发对N2O还原更具抗性的催化剂，有助于长期保持活性。

3. 周期性再生：实施周期性过程，定期将催化剂暴露在较高O2浓度下，有助于维持其活性。

4. 探索双金属或多组分催化剂：这可能在保持N2O选择性优势的同时提供更好的抗失活能力。

5. 原位表征研究：对反应过程中催化剂表面进行更详细的研究，可以提供关于失活机理的见解，指导催化剂设计。

6. 过程工程：开发允许在整个反应过程中更好地控制催化剂氧化状态的反应器设计，有助于保持最佳性能。

通过针对性的研究努力解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP有潜力成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择。
