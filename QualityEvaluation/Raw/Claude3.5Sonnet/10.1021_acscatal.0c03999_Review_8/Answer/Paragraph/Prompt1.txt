Increased selectivity: N2O promotes a more reduced state of catalytic sites, leading to higher selectivity for propylene. This is due to N2O inhibiting O2 adsorption, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.\n\n2. Modification of catalyst surface: N2O interaction with catalysts like NiMoO4 modifies the surface sites, decreasing OH groups and promoting M=O bonds formation. This change in surface chemistry contributes to improved selectivity.\n\n3. Dual role: N2O can act both as an inhibitor of non-selective oxidation and as a direct oxidant through its dissociated oxygen species (O-).\n\n4.

Maintaining the reduced state of catalytic sites over time.\n2. Preventing over-oxidation of the catalyst surface.\n3. Balancing the concentration of N2O to achieve optimal selectivity without compromising conversion.\n4. The reversible nature of N2O effects, which may require continuous N2O presence in the feed.\n\nTo address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:\n\n1. Optimize N2O concentration: Further research to determine the optimal N2O concentration for balancing selectivity and conversion.\n\n2. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain a reduced state even in the absence of N2O, potentially improving long-term stability.\n\n3.
