The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance propylene selectivity. N2O offers a milder oxidation environment compared to traditional oxygen-based processes, which can lead to improved product yields and reduced undesirable side reactions. However, the implementation of N2O in ODHP faces several challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and deactivation. The strong oxidizing nature of N2O can cause rapid degradation of catalytic materials, leading to decreased performance over time. Additionally, the formation of coke deposits on catalyst surfaces remains a persistent issue, further compromising long-term efficiency. To overcome these limitations and make N2O-based ODHP commercially viable, advanced research is needed to develop more robust and resistant catalysts, optimize reaction conditions, and explore novel reactor designs. Such efforts could potentially unlock the full potential of this promising approach, paving the way for more efficient and selective propylene production in the future.
