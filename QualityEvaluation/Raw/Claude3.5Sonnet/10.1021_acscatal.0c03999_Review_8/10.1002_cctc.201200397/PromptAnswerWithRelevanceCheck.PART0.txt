<questions>

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on the use of CO2 as an oxidant and discusses the promotional effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica. It does not mention N2O or compare different oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given information.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on using CO2 as an oxidant and discusses the use of Ni-promoted CrOx catalysts supported on SBA-15. It does not mention N2O or compare different oxidants in terms of propylene selectivity. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of N2O-ODHP based on this text.

To properly answer this question, additional research would be needed on N2O as an oxidant in ODHP, including its effects on propylene selectivity, catalysts used, challenges with deactivation and stability, and potential strategies for improvement. This information is not available in the given literature.

给定的文献中没有任何关于使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的氧化剂的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂，并探讨了在SBA-15上负载的镍促进的氧化铬催化剂的使用。文中没有提到N2O或比较不同氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面的差异。因此，我无法基于这篇文献对N2O-ODHP进行分析。

要正确回答这个问题，需要对N2O作为ODHP反应中的氧化剂进行额外的研究，包括其对丙烯选择性的影响、使用的催化剂、失活和稳定性方面的挑战，以及可能的改进策略。这些信息在给定的文献中是不可用的。

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on the use of CO2 as an oxidant and discusses the promotional effect of Ni on a CrOx catalyst supported on silica for this reaction. There is no mention of N2O, its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity, or catalysts specifically used with N2O as an oxidant. The literature also does not discuss challenges or strategies related to N2O-ODHP.

As the question cannot be answered based on the provided document, I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP or propose strategies to address its limitations. To answer this question accurately, additional literature specifically focused on N2O-ODHP would be required.

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的氧化剂的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂,以及镍对负载在二氧化硅上的铬氧化物催化剂在该反应中的促进作用。文中没有提到N2O、其在丙烯选择性方面的优势,或专门用于N2O作为氧化剂的催化剂。文献也没有讨论与N2O-ODHP相关的挑战或策略。

由于无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题,我无法对N2O作为ODHP中的氧化剂进行全面分析,也无法提出解决其局限性的策略。要准确回答这个问题,需要额外专门针对N2O-ODHP的文献。
