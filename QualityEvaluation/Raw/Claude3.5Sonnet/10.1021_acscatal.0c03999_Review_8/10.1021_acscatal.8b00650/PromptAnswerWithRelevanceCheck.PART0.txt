If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document appears to be about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using HCl and CeO2-based catalysts. It does not mention N2O, propylene selectivity comparisons, or challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given literature.

给定的文献中没有关于使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用的信息。该文档似乎是关于使用HCl和基于CeO2的催化剂进行丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。它没有提到N2O、丙烯选择性比较，或与N2O-ODHP中催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。因此，我无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document appears to be about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of HCl, catalyzed by CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals. It does not discuss N2O as an oxidant, propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, various catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP, or challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in this specific process. As such, I cannot provide an analysis of N2O-ODHP or propose strategies to address its limitations based on the given information.
