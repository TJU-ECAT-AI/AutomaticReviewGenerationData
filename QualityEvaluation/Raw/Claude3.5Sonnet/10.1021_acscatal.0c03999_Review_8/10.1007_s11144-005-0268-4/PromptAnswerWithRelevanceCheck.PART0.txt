The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation over chromium-based catalysts. It does not discuss N2O or compare different oxidants for this process.

Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot analyze the use of N2O in ODHP, discuss its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity, describe various catalysts employed, or address challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability specifically for N2O-ODHP. Similarly, I cannot propose research strategies or directions to address limitations of N2O-ODHP based on this document.

The question cannot be adequately answered using the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献中没有任何关于使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)氧化剂的信息。该文档主要关注使用二氧化碳(CO2)作为氧化剂在铬基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论N2O或比较该过程的不同氧化剂。

由于提供的文本中没有相关信息，我无法分析N2O在ODHP中的使用，讨论其在丙烯选择性方面的优势，描述所使用的各种催化剂，或特别针对N2O-ODHP解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。同样，我也无法根据这份文件提出研究策略或方向来解决N2O-ODHP的局限性。

使用给定文献中提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation over modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts. It does not mention N2O or discuss its advantages, challenges, or potential strategies for improvement in ODHP processes. Therefore, the question cannot be directly answered based on the provided literature.

However, we can extend the answer based on the general principles discussed in the document regarding oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. Choice of oxidant: Similar to how CO2 was used to enhance propane conversion and maintain catalyst activity, N2O could potentially offer advantages in terms of oxygen supply and selectivity control in ODHP.

2. Catalyst development: The study focused on Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline earth metals. For N2O-ODHP, research could explore similar catalyst modifications to optimize performance.

3. Selectivity improvement: The addition of promoters like potassium improved propylene selectivity in the CO2 system. Similar strategies could be investigated for N2O-ODHP to enhance selectivity.

4. Catalyst stability: The study showed that CO2 helped inhibit coke formation. Research on N2O-ODHP could focus on understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation mechanisms.

5. Reaction conditions optimization: The study examined effects of temperature and oxidant/propane ratio. Similar parametric studies would be crucial for N2O-ODHP process development.

6. Mechanistic understanding: The document discussed the role of different chromium species in the reaction. For N2O-ODHP, elucidating the reaction mechanism and active sites would be essential for catalyst design.

To address limitations and improve feasibility of N2O-ODHP, research directions could include:
1. Developing novel catalyst formulations with high activity and selectivity for N2O activation
2. Investigating the impact of support materials on catalyst performance and stability
3. Exploring the use of promoters to enhance selectivity and inhibit side reactions
4. Studying the reaction kinetics and mechanism to optimize process conditions
5. Addressing any safety and environmental concerns associated with N2O use in industrial processes

所提供的科学文献中没有关于使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂的信息。该文档主要讨论了在改性Cr/SiO2催化剂上使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。文中未提及N2O，也没有讨论其在ODHP过程中的优势、挑战或潜在的改进策略。因此，无法根据所提供的文献直接回答这个问题。

然而，我们可以根据文档中讨论的丙烷氧化脱氢的一般原理来扩展回答：

1. 氧化剂的选择：类似于CO2被用来提高丙烷转化率并维持催化剂活性，N2O可能在氧气供应和选择性控制方面提供优势。

2. 催化剂开发：该研究重点关注了经碱金属和碱土金属改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂。对于N2O-ODHP，研究可以探索类似的催化剂改性以优化性能。

3. 选择性改进：在CO2体系中，添加如钾等促进剂提高了丙烯选择性。可以为N2O-ODHP研究类似的策略以提高选择性。

4. 催化剂稳定性：研究表明CO2有助于抑制积碳。N2O-ODHP的研究可以集中在理解和缓解催化剂失活机制上。

5. 反应条件优化：该研究考察了温度和氧化剂/丙烷比例的影响。类似的参数研究对N2O-ODHP过程开发至关重要。

6. 机理理解：文档讨论了不同铬物种在反应中的作用。对于N2O-ODHP，阐明反应机理和活性位点对催化剂设计至关重要。

为了解决N2O-ODHP的局限性并提高其可行性，研究方向可能包括：
1. 开发具有高活性和选择性的新型催化剂配方，以激活N2O
2. 研究载体材料对催化剂性能和稳定性的影响
3. 探索使用促进剂来提高选择性并抑制副反应
4. 研究反应动力学和机理，以优化工艺条件
5. 解决与N2O在工业过程中使用相关的任何安全和环境问题

The literature provided does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The study focuses on using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation over modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of N2O as an oxidant for ODHP based on this specific literature.

However, I can provide some general information about the use of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation based on the given text:

1. CO2 was found to promote catalytic activity and maintain catalyst stability by:
   a) Increasing equilibrium conversion by diluting propane
   b) Inhibiting coke formation
   c) Enhancing propane conversion by reducing H2 concentration through the reversed water-gas shift reaction

2. The presence of CO2 improved both propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to using N2 as a diluent.

3. Various catalysts were studied, with Cr/SiO2 modified by alkali and alkaline earth metals showing promising results.

4. Potassium (K) was found to be an effective promoter, with optimal loading around 0.2-0.4% in 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

5. The addition of K decreased the redox potential and surface acidity of the catalysts, leading to decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

To improve this process, future research could focus on:
1. Optimizing catalyst composition and preparation methods
2. Investigating the long-term stability of the catalysts
3. Studying the reaction mechanism to better understand the role of CO2
4. Exploring other promoters or support materials to enhance catalyst performance

所提供的文献中没有关于使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂的信息。该研究主要关注使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为改性Cr/SiO2催化剂上丙烷脱氢的氧化剂。因此，我无法基于这篇特定文献对N2O作为ODHP氧化剂进行分析。

然而，根据给定的文本，我可以提供一些关于CO2在丙烷脱氢中使用的一般信息：

1. 发现CO2可以促进催化活性并维持催化剂稳定性，通过：
   a) 通过稀释丙烷来增加平衡转化率
   b) 抑制积碳形成
   c) 通过逆水气变换反应降低H2浓度来增强丙烷转化

2. 与使用N2作为稀释剂相比，CO2的存在既提高了丙烷转化率，又提高了丙烯选择性。

3. 研究了各种催化剂，其中由碱金属和碱土金属改性的Cr/SiO2显示出promising结果。

4. 钾（K）被发现是一种有效的促进剂，在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中的最佳负载量约为0.2-0.4%。

5. 添加K降低了催化剂的氧化还原电位和表面酸性，导致丙烷转化率降低但丙烯选择性提高。

为了改进这个过程，未来的研究可以集中在：
1. 优化催化剂组成和制备方法
2. 研究催化剂的长期稳定性
3. 研究反应机理，以更好地理解CO2的作用
4. 探索其他促进剂或载体材料以增强催化剂性能
