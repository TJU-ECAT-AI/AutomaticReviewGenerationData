[1] "Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O. 8,18"

[5] "The fact that the initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 were very similar over the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 indicates that the number of active sites in the beginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not reduced in the regenerated samples. However, the different dynamics of deactivation may be related to a fraction of the active species, which is more susceptible toward deactivation or simply not participating in the reaction due to a reduced accessibility."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O allows for the simultaneous functionalization of propane and utilization of an environmentally harmful gas.

Iron zeolites, especially steam-activated FeZSM-5, have demonstrated remarkable performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propene yields up to 25%. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported for V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as an oxidant. The superiority of N2O over O2 is further emphasized by the fact that ODHP with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) compared to N2O.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which leads to a rapid decrease in propene yield. This deactivation issue is a major drawback for iron zeolites in this process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst modification: Develop methods to enhance the stability of iron species in the zeolite channels, reducing their susceptibility to deactivation or inaccessibility.

2. Regeneration optimization: Improve regeneration techniques to maintain the remarkable stability of fresh FeZSM-5 in regenerated samples, potentially extending the duration of the reaction step in cyclic processes.

3. Coke formation mitigation: Investigate ways to minimize coke formation or develop in-situ coke removal techniques during the reaction.

4. Process engineering: Further optimize cyclic reactor designs and operation parameters to balance reaction and regeneration steps effectively.

5. N2O purification: Develop efficient methods for purifying N2O from tail-gases of chemical production plants, addressing the negative impact of contaminants like O2 and NO on the ODHP process.

6. Alternative N2O sources: Explore the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O, providing a low-cost and reasonably pure N2O source.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a practical and efficient process for propylene production could be significantly improved.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出显著的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O可以同时实现丙烷的官能化和利用一种环境有害气体。

铁沸石，尤其是蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5，在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出卓越的性能，初始丙烯产率高达25%。这一性能可与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂报告的最高值相媲美。N2O相对于O2的优势进一步体现在FeZSM-5上使用O2进行ODHP时丙烯产率很低（<5%）。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，这导致丙烯产率快速下降。这个失活问题是铁沸石在这个过程中的主要缺点。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具实际应用可行性，可以提出以下几个策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂改性：开发方法以提高沸石通道中铁物种的稳定性，减少它们对失活或不可接近性的敏感性。

2. 再生优化：改进再生技术，以在再生样品中保持新鲜FeZSM-5的卓越稳定性，可能延长循环过程中反应步骤的持续时间。

3. 焦炭形成缓解：研究最小化焦炭形成的方法，或开发反应过程中的原位焦炭去除技术。

4. 过程工程：进一步优化循环反应器设计和操作参数，有效平衡反应和再生步骤。

5. N2O纯化：开发从化学生产厂尾气中纯化N2O的有效方法，解决O2和NO等污染物对ODHP过程的负面影响。

6. 替代N2O来源：探索开发廉价和选择性催化系统，用于低温NH3氧化制备N2O，提供低成本且纯度较高的N2O来源。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP作为实际和高效的丙烯生产过程的潜力可能会大大提高。
