[1] "Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7"

[4] "Previous studies have concluded that the ODH of propane with O2 over FeZSM-5 leads to very low C3H6 yields (<5%) as compared to N2O. 8,18"

[5] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 2025% at 723773 K. Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites."

[6] "The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration. On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). The use of N2O leads to much higher propylene yields and selectivity, especially when used with iron zeolite catalysts.

The most promising catalyst for N2O-ODHP is steam-activated FeZSM-5, which can achieve initial propene yields up to 25%. This performance is comparable to the best results obtained with vanadium and molybdenum-based catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. In contrast, when O2 is used as the oxidant with FeZSM-5, the propylene yields are very low (<5%).

However, the major challenge in N2O-ODHP is rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This leads to a significant decrease in propylene yield over time. The presence of even small amounts of O2 in the reaction mixture is detrimental to propylene selectivity, emphasizing the crucial role of N2O as the oxidant.

To address the deactivation issue, a cyclic process has been demonstrated. This process involves alternating between reaction and regeneration steps, where the catalyst's initial activity is recovered through air-regeneration. This approach allows for continuous propylene production while managing catalyst deactivation.

To further improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical implementation, research could focus on:

1. Developing more coke-resistant catalysts or modifying existing catalysts to slow down deactivation.
2. Optimizing the cyclic process to maximize propylene yield and minimize downtime during regeneration.
3. Investigating methods to purify N2O from industrial waste streams, as the presence of other gases like O2 or NO can negatively impact the process.
4. Exploring catalyst modifications that maintain the high initial activity of fresh FeZSM-5 even after multiple regeneration cycles.
5. Researching more efficient and cost-effective ways to produce or source N2O, as the availability of low-cost, pure N2O is crucial for the economic viability of this process.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more attractive and feasible option for on-purpose propylene production, especially in locations with access to low-cost N2O sources.

与其他氧化剂相比，一氧化二氮（N2O）在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出显著的优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。使用N2O可以获得更高的丙烯产率和选择性，尤其是在与铁沸石催化剂一起使用时。

N2O-ODHP最有前景的催化剂是蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5，其初始丙烯产率可达25%。这一性能与使用O2作为氧化剂的钒和钼基催化剂的最佳结果相当。相比之下，当使用O2作为FeZSM-5的氧化剂时，丙烯产率非常低（<5%）。

然而，N2O-ODHP的主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活。这导致丙烯产率随时间显著下降。反应混合物中即使存在少量的O2也会对丙烯选择性产生不利影响，这强调了N2O作为氧化剂的关键作用。

为了解决失活问题，已经展示了一个循环过程。该过程涉及反应和再生步骤的交替，其中催化剂的初始活性通过空气再生来恢复。这种方法允许持续生产丙烯，同时管理催化剂失活。

为了进一步提高N2O-ODHP在实际应用中的可行性，研究可以集中在以下几个方面：

1. 开发更耐焦炭的催化剂或修改现有催化剂以减缓失活。
2. 优化循环过程，以最大化丙烯产率并最小化再生过程中的停机时间。
3. 研究从工业废气流中净化N2O的方法，因为O2或NO等其他气体的存在可能会对过程产生负面影响。
4. 探索催化剂改性，以在多次再生循环后仍保持新鲜FeZSM-5的高初始活性。
5. 研究更高效和更具成本效益的N2O生产或来源方法，因为低成本、纯净N2O的可用性对于该过程的经济可行性至关重要。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为一个更具吸引力和可行性的定向丙烯生产选择，特别是在可以获得低成本N2O来源的地方。
