Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O allows for higher propylene yields, with studies reporting yields up to 25% over iron zeolites, specifically steam-activated FeZSM-5. This performance is comparable to the best results achieved with vanadium and molybdenum-based catalysts using oxygen as the oxidant.

The superiority of N2O as an oxidant is further emphasized by the fact that when oxygen is used instead of N2O in ODHP over FeZSM-5, the propylene yields are drastically lower (less than 5%). This demonstrates the unique ability of N2O to promote selective oxidation of propane to propylene.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, with iron zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, showing the most promising results. These catalysts combine the benefits of zeolite structures with the catalytic properties of iron species, resulting in high propylene yields.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield over time, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration. The study demonstrates that while regeneration can restore the initial catalyst activity, the regenerated catalyst tends to deactivate faster than the fresh catalyst.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Further research into modifying the FeZSM-5 catalyst or developing new catalyst formulations that are more resistant to coking could improve long-term stability.

2. Process engineering: The study presents a cyclic process using multiple fixed-bed reactors in parallel, allowing for continuous propylene production by alternating between reaction and regeneration cycles. Further optimization of this process could enhance overall efficiency.

3. N2O sourcing and purification: Developing cost-effective methods to source and purify N2O, particularly from industrial waste streams, could make the process more economically viable.

4. In-situ regeneration: Investigating methods for continuous or periodic in-situ catalyst regeneration during the reaction could help maintain catalyst activity without the need for separate regeneration cycles.

5. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: More detailed studies on the nature of coke formation and its impact on active sites could lead to better strategies for preventing or mitigating deactivation.

6. Exploring synergistic effects: While the study showed that adding small amounts of oxygen was detrimental to the process, further research into potential synergistic effects with other gases or additives might yield improvements in catalyst stability or selectivity.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production, especially in scenarios where low-cost, purified N2O is available.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂相比其他氧化剂显示出显著的优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O可以获得更高的丙烯产率，研究报告显示在铁沸石上的产率可达25%，特别是在蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5上。这一性能与使用氧气作为氧化剂的钒和钼基催化剂的最佳结果相当。

N2O作为氧化剂的优越性进一步体现在，当在FeZSM-5上使用氧气代替N2O进行ODHP时，丙烯产率大幅降低（低于5%）。这表明N2O具有独特的能力，可以促进丙烷选择性氧化为丙烯。

N2O-ODHP中使用了各种催化剂，其中铁沸石，特别是FeZSM-5，显示出最有前景的结果。这些催化剂结合了沸石结构的优势和铁物种的催化特性，从而获得高丙烯产率。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。这导致丙烯产率随时间快速下降，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。研究表明，虽然再生可以恢复催化剂的初始活性，但再生后的催化剂比新鲜催化剂失活得更快。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：进一步研究改进FeZSM-5催化剂或开发新的催化剂配方，以提高其抗积碳能力，从而改善长期稳定性。

2. 工艺工程：研究提出了一种使用多个并联固定床反应器的循环过程，通过反应和再生循环交替来实现连续丙烯生产。进一步优化这一过程可以提高整体效率。

3. N2O来源和纯化：开发从工业废气流中获取和纯化N2O的经济有效方法，可以使该过程在经济上更具可行性。

4. 原位再生：研究在反应过程中连续或周期性进行原位催化剂再生的方法，可以帮助维持催化剂活性，而无需单独的再生循环。

5. 理解失活机制：对积碳形成的性质及其对活性位点影响的更详细研究，可以带来更好的防止或减缓失活的策略。

6. 探索协同效应：虽然研究表明添加少量氧气对该过程有害，但进一步研究与其他气体或添加剂的潜在协同效应可能会改善催化剂稳定性或选择性。

通过解决这些挑战并推进这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择，特别是在可获得低成本、纯化N2O的情况下。

3. Coke formation mitigation: Investigate ways to minimize coke formation or develop in-situ coke removal techniques during the reaction.

4. Process engineering: Further optimize cyclic reactor designs and operation parameters to balance reaction and regeneration steps effectively.

5. N2O purification: Develop efficient methods for purifying N2O from tail-gases of chemical production plants, addressing the negative impact of contaminants like O2 and NO on the ODHP process.

6. Alternative N2O sources: Explore the development of cheap and selective catalyst systems for low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O, providing a low-cost and reasonably pure N2O source.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a practical and efficient process for propylene production could be significantly improved.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). The use of N2O leads to much higher propylene yields and selectivity, especially when used with iron zeolite catalysts.

The most promising catalyst for N2O-ODHP is steam-activated FeZSM-5, which can achieve initial propene yields up to 25%. This performance is comparable to the best results obtained with vanadium and molybdenum-based catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. In contrast, when O2 is used as the oxidant with FeZSM-5, the propylene yields are very low (<5%).

However, the major challenge in N2O-ODHP is rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This leads to a significant decrease in propylene yield over time. The presence of even small amounts of O2 in the reaction mixture is detrimental to propylene selectivity, emphasizing the crucial role of N2O as the oxidant.

To address the deactivation issue, a cyclic process has been demonstrated. This process involves alternating between reaction and regeneration steps, where the catalyst's initial activity is recovered through air-regeneration. This approach allows for continuous propylene production while managing catalyst deactivation.

To further improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical implementation, research could focus on:

1. Developing more coke-resistant catalysts or modifying existing catalysts to slow down deactivation.
2. Optimizing the cyclic process to maximize propylene yield and minimize downtime during regeneration.
3. Investigating methods to purify N2O from industrial waste streams, as the presence of other gases like O2 or NO can negatively impact the process.
4. Exploring catalyst modifications that maintain the high initial activity of fresh FeZSM-5 even after multiple regeneration cycles.
5. Researching more efficient and cost-effective ways to produce or source N2O, as the availability of low-cost, pure N2O is crucial for the economic viability of this process.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more attractive and feasible option for on-purpose propylene production, especially in locations with access to low-cost N2O sources.

然而，N2O-ODHP的主要挑战是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失活。这导致丙烯产率随时间显著下降。反应混合物中即使存在少量的O2也会对丙烯选择性产生不利影响，这强调了N2O作为氧化剂的关键作用。

为了解决失活问题，已经展示了一个循环过程。该过程涉及反应和再生步骤的交替，其中催化剂的初始活性通过空气再生来恢复。这种方法允许持续生产丙烯，同时管理催化剂失活。

为了进一步提高N2O-ODHP在实际应用中的可行性，研究可以集中在以下几个方面：

1. 开发更耐焦炭的催化剂或修改现有催化剂以减缓失活。
2. 优化循环过程，以最大化丙烯产率并最小化再生过程中的停机时间。
3. 研究从工业废气流中净化N2O的方法，因为O2或NO等其他气体的存在可能会对过程产生负面影响。
4. 探索催化剂改性，以在多次再生循环后仍保持新鲜FeZSM-5的高初始活性。
5. 研究更高效和更具成本效益的N2O生产或来源方法，因为低成本、纯净N2O的可用性对于该过程的经济可行性至关重要。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为一个更具吸引力和可行性的定向丙烯生产选择，特别是在可以获得低成本N2O来源的地方。
