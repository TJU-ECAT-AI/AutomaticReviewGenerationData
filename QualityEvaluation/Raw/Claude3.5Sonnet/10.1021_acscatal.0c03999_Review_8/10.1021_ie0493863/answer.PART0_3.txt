[1] "Recent studies have reported the remarkable performance of iron zeolites for the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation according to eq 1. 6-9 This reaction leads to the simultaneous functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environmentally harmful gas."

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated FeZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%.6,7 These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propene yield.7"

[4] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5 is a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of 2025% at 723773 K. Small amounts of O2 in the C3H8+N2O mixture are detrimental for achieving a high propene selectivity, further indicating the vital role of N2O as the oxidant in ODHP over iron zeolites."

[5] "The catalyst presents a strong deactivation due to coke formation; its initial activity is recovered by air-regeneration. On this basis, a cyclic process for continuous propylene production has been demonstrated."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows significant advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O allows for the simultaneous functionalization of propane and utilization of an environmentally harmful gas.

Iron zeolites, especially steam-activated FeZSM-5, have demonstrated remarkable performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propene yields up to 25%. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported for V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as an oxidant.

The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include catalyst deactivation and stability. The major drawback is rapid deactivation due to coke formation, leading to a decrease in propene yield. However, the initial activity can be recovered through air-regeneration.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Develop catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation.
2. Optimize regeneration processes to extend catalyst lifetime and maintain high activity.
3. Investigate the use of promoters or modifiers to enhance catalyst stability.
4. Design more efficient reactor systems, such as the demonstrated cyclic process for continuous propylene production.
5. Explore methods to purify N2O from industrial waste streams for cost-effective implementation.
6. Study the synergistic effects of N2O with other oxidants to potentially mitigate deactivation issues.
7. Investigate the nature and distribution of active iron species to better understand and control catalyst performance.

These approaches could potentially overcome the current limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial application.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比具有显著优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O可以同时实现丙烷的功能化和利用环境有害气体。

铁沸石，特别是蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5，在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出卓越的性能，初始丙烯产率可达25%。这一性能与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战包括催化剂失活和稳定性。主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活，导致丙烯产率下降。然而，初始活性可以通过空气再生来恢复。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 开发具有更高抗焦炭形成能力的催化剂。
2. 优化再生过程，延长催化剂寿命并保持高活性。
3. 研究使用助剂或改性剂来提高催化剂稳定性。
4. 设计更高效的反应器系统，如已证实的用于连续丙烯生产的循环过程。
5. 探索从工业废气流中纯化N2O的方法，以实现经济高效的应用。
6. 研究N2O与其他氧化剂的协同作用，以可能缓解失活问题。
7. 研究活性铁物种的性质和分布，以更好地理解和控制催化剂性能。

这些方法可能有助于克服当前的限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业应用选择。
