[1] "Some studies have also been performed on the effect of H2S or other sulfur species on the ODH reactions of light alkanes. (13, 14) Initial works by Tischler and Wing (17) and Porchey and Royer (18) have demonstrated the merits of adding H2S to an uncatalyzed system for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%). (15)"

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about using N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, based on the limited information available:

1. N2O shows some promise as an oxidant for ODHP, with the ability to enhance propylene selectivity. A N2O/O2 oxidant mixture was reported to increase propylene selectivity by 25% compared to other oxidants when using vanadia catalysts.

2. The main challenge identified is that the increased selectivity with N2O is only achieved at low propane conversion rates (1-10%). This suggests that while N2O can improve selectivity, it may come at the cost of reduced overall conversion.

3. The literature does not provide information on catalyst deactivation, stability issues, or strategies to address limitations of N2O-ODHP.

4. To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, research could focus on:
   - Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity at higher conversion rates
   - Investigating optimal N2O/O2 ratios to balance selectivity and conversion
   - Exploring ways to stabilize catalysts under N2O oxidation conditions
   - Studying the reaction mechanisms to better understand how N2O enhances selectivity

5. The literature mentions other alternative oxidants like H2S, which have shown promise in uncatalyzed systems. Comparative studies between N2O and these alternatives could provide valuable insights for improving ODHP processes.

Overall, while N2O shows potential for improving propylene selectivity in ODHP, more research is needed to address the conversion limitations and develop practical implementations of this approach.

根据文献提供的有限信息，我们可以得出以下结论：

1. N2O作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂显示出一些潜力，能够提高丙烯的选择性。有报道称，在使用钒基催化剂时，N2O/O2氧化剂混合物与其他氧化剂相比，可以将丙烯选择性提高25%。

2. 主要挑战是，使用N2O提高的选择性仅在低丙烷转化率（1-10%）下实现。这表明虽然N2O可以提高选择性，但可能会以降低整体转化率为代价。

3. 文献中没有提供关于催化剂失活、稳定性问题或解决N2O-ODHP局限性的策略的信息。

4. 为了使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究可以集中在以下几个方面：
   - 开发在更高转化率下保持高选择性的催化剂
   - 研究优化N2O/O2比例，以平衡选择性和转化率
   - 探索在N2O氧化条件下稳定催化剂的方法
   - 研究反应机理，以更好地理解N2O如何提高选择性

5. 文献中提到了其他替代氧化剂，如H2S，在无催化剂系统中显示出潜力。比较N2O与这些替代品的研究可能为改进ODHP工艺提供有价值的见解。

总的来说，虽然N2O在提高ODHP中丙烯选择性方面显示出潜力，但还需要更多研究来解决转化率限制并开发这种方法的实际应用。
