Vanadium-containing mesoporous molecular sieves synthesized
by both template-ion exchange (TIE) and direct hydrothermal
(DHT) methods have been studied for partial oxidation of lower
alkanes. UVvis and in situ laser Raman spectroscopic studies sug-
gest that the former synthetic method can provide tetrahedrally
coordinated vanadium species mainly dispersed on the wall sur-
face of MCM-41, while the latter method leads to vanadium sites
mainly incorporated into the framework of MCM-41. H2-TPR mea-
surements show that the vanadium species in the TIE samples can
be reduced at lower temperatures than those in the DHT samples.
NH3-TPD investigations suggest that weak acid sites mainly exist
over MCM-41 along with a small amount of medium ones. The in-
troduction of vanadium by the TIE method increased the amount of
weak acid sites, while both weak and medium acid sites of MCM-41
are decreased with introducing vanadium up to a certain content
by the DHT method. In the oxidations of ethane and propane, the
alkane conversions increase remarkably with increasing vanadium
content, and moderate selectivities to ethylene and propylene are
obtained over the TIE catalysts. The same catalysts, however, are
not selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane. On the
otherhand,propyleneandisobuteneareobtainedwithhighselectiv-
ity over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1 wt%
in the oxidations of propane and isobutane, respectively. Acrolein
and methacrolein can also be formed respectively with considerable
selectivity over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content. It
is likely that the medium acid sites that remained in these samples
play roles in the formation of oxygenates through the adsorption of
alkenes or allylic intermediates.

INTRODUCTION
MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, has at-
tracted much attention as catalyst support since it pos-
sesses well-ordered channels with controllable uniform
pore size of 210 nm as well as large surface area. The
active component introduced to the channel of MCM-
41 could thus be tailored in the nano-order space. More-
over, many heteroatoms could also be incorporated into

the wall of MCM-41 to substitute Si4+ like the situation in
many zeolites, though the framework of MCM-41 is amor-
phous (13). Thus, the isolated active centers as can be
seen in metal-substituted aluminosilicate or aluminophos-
phate molecular sieves can also be generated in the case of
MCM-41.
We focus our studies on vanadium-containing MCM-
41 because the isolated vanadium site over many sup-
ported vanadia catalysts has been suggested to account for
the selective oxidation of hydrocarbon (4). Furthermore,
vanadium-substituted zeolites such as Vsilicalite (5) and
VAPO-5 (6, 7) have shown good performance in the ox-
idative dehydrogenation of propane. Many publications
have contributed to the syntheses and characterizations
of VMCM-41 in recent years (810), but the studies on
its catalytic properties are still scarce and the reports are
mainly limited to liquid-phase oxidation using H2O2 or tert-
butyl hydroperoxide (1113). Only the partial oxidation of
methanol (14) and that of methane (15) have been reported
so far for gas-phase oxidation using oxygen.
Regarding the synthesis of VMCM-41, the direct hy-
drothermal (DHT) method in which a vanadium source
such as VO(C2O4) or VO(SO4) is added directly to synthe-
sis gel containing a silicon source and an organic template
prior to hydrothermal synthesis has mainly been reported
so far (814). Conventional impregnation has also been
used to prepare vanadium-containing MCM-41 (15, 16).
However, this method cannot ensure the introduction of
vanadium into the mesopore of MCM-41. Moreover, some
contraction of channels seems to occur by the impregna-
tion method. The introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by
a grafting method using an organic vanadium compound
has been reported (17, 18). Recently, we found that vana-
diumcouldbeintroducedintothechannelofMCM-41with-
out collapse of the mesoporous structure by a template-ion
exchange (TIE) method, viz., by exchanging VO2+ ions
in the aqueous solution with the template cations com-
prised in the as-synthesized (uncalcined) MCM-41 (19).
This paper is to investigate and compare the catalytic
properties of the VMCM-41 prepared by the TIE and
DHT methods in partial oxidation or oxidative dehydro-
genation of lower alkanes including ethane, propane, and
isobutane.

VMCM-41 FOR LOWER ALKANE OXIDATION
309
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation
MCM-41 was prepared by a modified procedure of Beck
and co-workers (20). The solution of hexadecyltrimethyl-
ammonium bromide (C16H33(CH3)3NBr) (26.4 g in 110 g of
H2O) was added to the solution of sodium silicate (55 wt%
SiO2, 15.4 g in 80 g of H2O). The pH of the mixture was
adjusted to 11.0 by 4 N HCl. The resulting gel was allowed
to stir for 1 h before being transferred to a Teflon bottle and
placed in a stainless-steel autoclave. The hydrothermal syn-
thesis was carried out at 120C for 96 h. The resultant solid
was recovered by filtration, washed thoroughly with deion-
ized water (20 L) to remove Na+ and the excess template,
and subsequently dried at 40C in vacuum for 24 h.
For the TIE synthesis of VMCM-41, 2 g of the as-
synthesized MCM-41 containing ca. 50 wt% template was
added to a solution of vanadyl oxalate (a certain amount
of VOC2O4 in 40 g of H2O), stirred vigorously at ambient
temperature for 1 h, and then kept at 80C for 20 h. The
exchanged resultant was filtered, washed thoroughly with
deionized water, and then dried at 40C in vacuum for 24 h.
The as-synthesized VMCM-41 (TIE) was finally calcined
by heating from ambient temperature to 550C at a rate
of 1C/min and kept at 550C for 6 h in a flow of dry air
(1 L/min). If the calcined MCM-41without template was
used in the same experiment to replace the as-synthesized
MCM-41, less than 10% of the vanadium in the solution
remained in MCM-41 after filtration, washing, drying, and
calcination. On the other hand, ca. 6080% of the vanadium
was introduced to MCM-41 using the uncalcined MCM-41
(19). These observations support the occurrence of ion
exchange
between
the
template
cations
in
the
as-
synthesized MCM-41 and the VO2+ ions in the solution.
For the direct hydrothermal synthesis of VMCM-41, the
solution of vanadyl oxalate (a certain amount of VOC2O4
in 40 g of H2O) was added to the mixture of sodium silicate
and C16H33(CH3)3NBr solutions before pH adjustment as
described in the synthesis of MCM-41. After hydrothermal
synthesis at 120C for 96 h, the product was filtered, washed
thoroughly with deionized water, dried at 40C in vacuum
for 24 h, and finally calcined with the same procedure as
described for TIE synthesis.
Characterization
XRD was performed using a Rigaku RINT2500VHF
diffractometer with Cu KÎ± radiation (45 kV, 450 mA). Small
divergent and scattering slits (0.05 mm and 1/6 degrees,
respectively) were selected to avoid the high background
at low diffraction angle.
The N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K was measured
using Belsorp 18SP equipment (volumetric). The pore size
distribution was determined using the BJH method.
The diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra were recorded on
a PerkinElmer UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer (Lambda 900).
The powdery sample was loaded in a quartz cell, and the
spectra were collected in 230700 nm with a reference of
BaSO4.
In situ laser Raman spectroscopic studies were carried
out using a JASCO NR-1800 (OL) spectrometer to obtain
information about the coordination of vanadium under the
conditions close to those used for reactions. The sample
wafer was placed in a high-temperature in situ Raman cell
made of quartz. The spectra were recorded in O2 flow at
different temperatures.
H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was per-
formed using a flow system equipped with a thermal con-
ductivity detector. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of sam-
ple was first pretreated in a U-type quartz reactor with a
gas flow containing N2 (20 ml/min) and O2 (10 ml/min) at
550C for 1 h and then purged with pure N2 (30 ml/min). Af-
ter cooling to 30C, H2N2 (5% H2) gas mixture was intro-
duced into the reactor and the temperature was increased
to 900C at a rate of 10C/min.
NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) mea-
surements were carried out on BEL JAPAN TPD-1-AT
equipment. After pretreated in a gas flow of He (20 ml/min)
and O2 (10 ml/min) at 550C, the sample was degassed in
vacuum. The adsorption of NH3 was carried out at 120C
and at a pressure of 2.67 kPa for 1 h, and then the NH3
that remained in the gas phase was purged by He. TPD was
performed in He flow by raising the temperature to 600C
at a rate of 10C/min. The desorbed NH3 was detected by
a mass spectrometer.
Catalytic Reaction
The partial oxidation reactions were carried out using a
conventional fixed-bed flow reactor: 0.2 g of catalyst, which
had been pelletized and sieved to 250417 m, was loaded
into a U-type reactor made of quartz tube and treated in
a gas flow containing N2 (10 ml/min) and O2 (3 ml/min) at
550C for 1 h before reaction. The reaction was started by
introducing a gas mixture of N2 (10 ml/min), O2 (3 ml/min),
alkane (6 ml/min), and He (31 ml/min) to the reactor. N2
was used as the internal standard for calculating the con-
versions of O2 and alkane, while He was used for dilution
to control the partial pressures of reactants. The products
were analyzed by on-line gas chromatographs. The alkane
conversion was also calculated from the concentrations of
products and the remained alkanes, and carbon balance was
evaluated. Generally, carbon balance was better than 95%.
Blank runs were also carried out with an empty reactor
under above reaction conditions. For C2H6 oxidation, no
reaction occurred at 550C and the conversion of C2H6
was 1.2% at 600C. In the cases of oxidation of C3H8
and i-C4H10, the conversions of C3H8 and i-C4H10 were

not detectable at 550 and 500C, respectively. Catalytic
reactions were thus carried out using the conditions under
which the gas-phase reactions could be neglected.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Properties of Catalysts
Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of the samples prepared by
both TIE and DHT methods with different Si/V ratios. The
Si/V ratio shown here was determined from ICP measure-
ments. For TIE samples (Fig. 1A), four diffraction peaks
ascribed to (100), (110), (200), and (210) of MCM-41 were
all observed, and the peak intensity was almost kept with
increasing vanadium content to a Si/V ratio of 23, indicating
no de-organization at long range of the mesoporous struc-
ture of MCM-41 during TIE synthesis. For DHT samples
(Fig. 1B), the peak of (210) at 2Î¸ of ca. 6was not clearly ob-
served. This phenomenon was also observed previously and
was suggested to relate to the incorporation of vanadium to
the wall of MCM-41 (9). Concerning the shift of peak po-
sition after introducing vanadium, Sayari and co-workers
(8) reported a slight shift of (100) to lower diffraction

angle, in other words, a slight increase in d spacing. How-
ever, the results from the groups of Kevan and co-workers
(9) and Haller and co-workers (10) showed an obvious de-
crease in d spacing after introducing vanadium to MCM-
41. Here, no definite tendency in peak shift was observed
with increasing vanadium content. As vanadium content in-
creased up to a Si/V ratio of 23 [Fig. 1B (g)], only the peak of
(100) was detectable, indicating the decrease in structural
regularity.
The BET surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter
as functions of vanadium content are shown in Fig. 2. The
increase in vanadium content slightly decreased the surface
area but did not significantly alter the pore volume and
pore diameter of TIE sample. However, the surface area
and the pore volume of DHT sample dropped remarkably
as vanadium content increased up to 3.6 wt% (Si/V = 23).
The shrinkage of pore diameter was also observed at the
same time. These observations agreed well with the XRD
results shown in Fig. 1B, which indicated a de-organization
at long range as vanadium content increased to a Si/V ratio
of 23. Thus, the amount of vanadium introduced to MCM-
41 by the DHT method without destroying its mesoporous
structure was less than that by the TIE method.

(b)(d), and 3B, (a)(c)], both TIE and DHT methods ex-
hibited UVvis absorption bands at ca. 275 and 340 nm,
both of which could be assigned to the low-energy charge-
transfer transitions between tetrahedral oxygen ligands and
the V5+ center. A weak band near 600 nm, which arose
from the dd transition of VO2+ cation, was also observed
for the samples with high vanadium content. These re-
sults suggest that some tetrahedrally coordinated vanadium
species already exist in the as-synthesized samples. Since
the sensitivity of the band at 600 nm of VO2+ is much lower
than that of the band at 275 or 340 nm (21), a large part
of VO2+ may still exist though they could not be observed
with UVvis spectroscopy.
After calcination at 550C, the absorption bands at 275
and 340 nm overlapped and the spectra became broad, par-
ticularly for the TIE samples as shown in the figure. The
samples with low vanadium content showed the main peak
at 275 nm, and the component at 340 nm increased with
increasing vanadium content. The component at 340 nm
became dominant for the TIE samples as the vanadium
content exceeded 1.8 wt% (Si/V = 47), while that at 275 nm
was still the main component for the DHT sample even
with vanadium content of 3.6 wt% (Si/V = 23). Combin-
ing the results of ESR and 51V NMR, Kevan and co-
workers (9) suggested that the UV band at 275 nm ob-
served for the calcined VMCM-41 corresponded to the
vanadium incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41
while that at 340 nm corresponded to the vanadium on its
wall. Thus, the results obtained here suggest that the vana-
dium species mainly exist on the wall surface in the TIE
samples, while a large part of them are incorporated inside
the framework of MCM-41 in the DHT samples. Further-
more, the contribution of the square pyramidal (415 nm)
and octahedral (450 nm) type vanadium species became
considerable in the TIE samples with high vanadium con-
tent. Such species were probably formed due to the hy-
dration of the surface tetrahedral vanadium under ambient
conditions (9).
In our preceding paper (19), we reported that the ter-
minal V=O bond of monomer VO4 tetrahedron dispersed
on MCM-41 was observed by laser Raman spectroscopy
(Raman shift at ca. 1035 cm1) for the TIE samples,
while such terminal V=O was almost not detectable for
the DHT samples. However, because those measurements
were carried out under ambient conditions, a large part
of the vanadium may be hydrated as indicated by the re-
sults of UVvis experiments. We thus carried out in situ
Raman measurements in O2 flow at different temperatures.
Figure 4 shows the spectra of TIE (Si/V = 47) and DHT
(Si/V = 40) samples with a similar vanadium content. In the
case of TIE sample (Fig. 4A), the peak at 1030 cm1 was
clearly observed, even at 23C, and the intensity of this peak
increased remarkably with temperature, indicating the in-
crease in the concentration of terminal V=O. Probably, the
removal of H2O or OH, which was coordinated to vana-
dium under ambient conditions, formed mainly monomer
VO4 tetrahedron with terminal V=O in the presence of O2
at high temperature. A weak peak at ca. 970 cm1, which
could be assigned to SiOSi stretching vibration (22), also
appeared as the temperature rose. The peak ascribed to V
OV stretching was observed at ca. 920 cm1, but it was
very weak, even at high temperature, suggesting that the
oligomeric VOx cluster was only minor, even at reaction
temperature over the TIE sample. For the DHT sample
(Fig. 4B), the peak at 1030 cm1 could almost not be ob-
served at room temperature, but it appeared and gradually
increased as the temperature was raised. This observation
indicates that the terminal V=O also exists on the surface
of the DHT sample under temperatures close to those used
for reactions in the presence of O2. However, the inten-
sity of this peak was much lower (ca. 1/6 at 400C and
1/4 at 480C) as compared with that for the TIE sample,
suggesting a lower concentration of the terminal V=O on
the surface of the DHT sample. This may be an indication

that a large part of vanadium was incorporated into the
framework. The fact that the peak at 920 cm1 belonging
to VOV has not been observed for this sample suggests
that vanadium is highly isolated.
Figure5showsH2-TPRprofiles.BothTIEandDHTsam-
ples showed a single reduction peak, which was completely
different from those for V2O5. For TIE samples, the peak
temperature changed from 518 to 525C with increasing
vanadium content from 1.0 wt% (Si/V = 83) to 3.6 wt%
(Si/V = 23). The reduction peaks were at 548 and 579C for
the DHT samples with similar vanadium contents to the
TIE samples. Therefore, the vanadium species in TIE sam-
ples could be reduced more easily as compared with that in
DHT samples. Wachs and co-workers (22) have reported
that the reduction peak for surface vanadium oxide species
highly dispersed on a silica support (V content, 1 wt%) ap-
pears at ca. 525C and that for vanadium in V-substituted
silicalite (V content, 1.5 wt%) is at ca. 550C. These two
peak temperatures are almost the same as those observed
here for the TIE and DHT samples (Fig. 5), respectively.
This suggests that the coordination environments of vana-
dium species in TIE and DHT samples resemble those
in silica-supported highly dispersed vanadium oxide and
V-substituted silicalite, respectively. Such a result is con-
sistent with the conclusion from UVvis and laser Raman
spectroscopic measurements described above.
The acidic properties of VMCM-41 prepared by TIE
and DHT methods were investigated by NH3-TPD and
the results were shown in Fig. 6. MCM-41, without vana-
dium, showed a main peak at 502 K and a broad shoulder
at 710730 K, suggesting that weak acid sites were dom-
inant on MCM-41, but some with medium strength also
existed. Recently, FSM-16, another type of pure siliceous
mesoporous material, has been found to possess acid sites
(H0 = ca. 3.0 to 5.6) stronger than amorphous silica
(H0 = ca. +3.0 to +4.8), and the nature of such acid sites
is suggested to be perturbed silanol groups (23, 24). Al-
though we still do not know the natures of the acid sites
in pure siliceous MCM-41 at this moment, we speculate
that the acid sites with medium strength might also arise
from the silanol groups on defective sites. Figure 6A showed
that the peak intensity for weak acid sites was remarkably
increased with introducing vanadium by the TIE method,
and the peak position slightly shifted to lower temperature
at the same time. The peak at 710730 K ascribed to the
acid sites with medium strength, however, vanished simul-
taneously, probably due to the covering of such acid sites by
vanadium species. On the other hand, these medium acid
sites remained after introducing a small amount of vana-
dium by the DHT method, but both the medium and the
weak acid sites became attenuated as the vanadium con-
tent increased above 0.7 wt% (Si/V = 120) and the shift
of peak position to lower temperature was also observed
at the same time. Lim and Haller (14) have observed the
increase in the amount of weak Lewis acid by increasing

vanadium content in VMCM-41 and ascribed such weak
Lewis acid sites to isolated vanadium sites tetrahedrally co-
ordinated with oxygen. As described above, in our case,
the tetrahedral vanadium species were mainly dispersed on
the wall surface of MCM-41 in the TIE samples. Thus, the
increase in weak acid sites with increasing vanadium con-
tent in TIE samples could probably be due to the increase
in the concentration of surface-isolated tetrahedral vana-
dium species. On the other hand, in the case of DHT sam-
ples, a large part of vanadium atoms were incorporated into
the framework, and the surface concentration of vanadium
was limited. Moreover, the surface area was also decreased
to some extent by increasing vanadium to a high con-
tent. These probably led to the slight decrease in the weak
acid sites with increasing vanadium content as shown in
Fig. 6B.
Catalytic Oxidation of Ethane
Figure 7 compares the results obtained from the oxida-
tion of C2H6 using TIE and DHT samples at 550C. For
TIE samples (Fig. 7A), C2H6 conversion increased almost
linearly with increasing vanadium content up to 3.6 wt%
(Si/V = 23), and a further increase in vanadium content did
not remarkably affect C2H6 conversion. C2H4 selectivity
slightly decreased with introducing vanadium to MCM-41
but did not change with vanadium content. In other words,
the increase in vanadium content increased C2H6 conver-
sion but did not significantly enhance the consecutive oxi-
dation of C2H4 to CO and CO2.
For the oxidation of C2H6 over DHT samples, as shown
in Fig. 7B, the incorporation of vanadium also enhanced the
reaction, but the increase in C2H6 conversion was deceler-
ated as vanadium content exceeded 0.7 wt% (Si/V = 120).
Furthermore, C2H6 conversion dropped as vanadium con-
tent increased from 2 to 3.6 wt%. C2H4 selectivity showed
a tendency to decrease with increasing vanadium con-
tent. Thus, the DHT sample with high vanadium con-
tent is not selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
C2H6.
Figure 8 shows the change of catalytic performance with
reaction temperature over the TIE and DHT samples with
the same vanadium content of 3.6 wt% (Si/V = 23). The
TIE sample gave higher C2H6 conversion than the DHT
sample in the whole temperature region investigated. The
activation energies calculated for the TIE and DHT sam-
ples were 120 and 95 kJ mol1, respectively. C2H4 selectivity
decreased with increasing temperature over the TIE sam-
ple probably due to the consecutive oxidation. The increase

in C2H4 selectivity with increasing temperature at 550C,
however, was observed over the DHT sample. Probably, the
contribution of gas-phase radical reactions, which may pro-
duce C2H4, cannot be neglected at such a high temperature.
Catalytic Oxidation of Propane
Figure 9 shows the results of C3H8 oxidation over TIE
and DHT samples with different vanadium content. The
oxidation of C3H8 over pure siliceous MCM-41 produced
mainly CO2 along with a small amount of acrolein at
500C.C3H8 conversionincreasedremarkablywithincreas-
ing vanadium content over TIE samples (Fig. 9A). C3H6
selectivity also increased with increasing vanadium content
up to 1.8 wt% (Si/V = 47) and did not significantly change
with a further increase in vanadium content. In the case of
DHT samples (Fig. 9B), the introduction of vanadium also
enhanced the reaction, but C3H8 conversion showed a ten-
dency to decrease as vanadium content exceeded 1.0 wt%
(Si/V = 87). C3H6 selectivity increased sharply with increas-
ing vanadium content up to 1.0 wt% and then was held at
a high level of ca. 70%. Not only C3H6 but acrolein was
also formed over DHT samples. The selectivity to acrolein
was the highest over the sample with vanadium content of
0.40.7 wt% (Si/V = 210120) at 500C. Further increasing
in vanadium content decreased its selectivity.
To compare the selectivity to C3H6 and acrolein over TIE
and DHT samples at a similar C3H8 conversion level, the
catalytic results over DHT samples at 550C were shown
in Fig. 9C. At such a temperature, C3H8 conversion in-
creased to >15% with increasing vanadium content up to
0.7 wt% (Si/V = 120), and simultaneously, C3H6 selectivity
increased near 60%. As compared with the results for TIE
samples (Fig. 9A), it is apparent that higher C3H6 selecti-
vity could be achieved over DHT samples at a similar C3H8
conversion level. Furthermore, acrolein with a selectivity
of ca. 20% and yield of ca. 3% was obtained over the DHT
sample with a vanadium content of 0.7 wt% (Si/V = 120),
while acrolein was nearly not formed over TIE samples. It
should be mentioned that C3H6 yield over the DHT sam-
ples with vanadium content 1 wt% was comparable to the
best one achieved over Vsilicalite and VAPO-5 zeolites
(57). However, the formation of a considerable amount
of acrolein has never been reported over V-containing zeo-
litesorsilica-supportedvanadiacatalysts.Thus,VMCM-41
synthesized by the DHT method is unique for the partial
oxidation of C3H8 to acrolein.

were investigated over the catalyst (V content 0.7 wt%,
Si/V = 120) with the highest acrolein selectivity. Figure 10
shows the influence of reaction temperature on C3H8
conversion and product selectivities. C3H8 conversion in-
creased with reaction temperature and the activation en-
ergy for C3H8 conversion was calculated to be 67 kJ mol1.
The increase in temperature increased the selectivity to
acroleinanddecreasedthattoCO2.C3H6 selectivityslightly
decreased by increasing the temperature to 500C. CO be-
gan to be formed at >425C.
Figure 11 shows the effect of partial pressure of O2 on
catalytic performances at 520C and constant C3H8 pres-
sure of 12.2 kPa. C3H8 conversion increased with increasing
O2 pressure, and the calculation from a plot of the logarithm
of r(C3H8) versus the logarithm of P(O2) indicated that the
reaction order for O2 was 0.60  0.05. At low O2 pressure,
C3H6 and acrolein were dominant products. The sum of the
selectivities to C3H6 and acrolein reached 95 and 87% with
C3H8 conversion of 3.0 and 4.4% at O2 pressures of 1.0 and
2.0 kPa, respectively. To our knowledge, these results are
outstanding among all the reported catalysts for partial oxi-
dation of C3H8. C3H6 selectivity decreased first sharply in
a low O2 pressure range and then gradually with increas-
ing O2 pressure. Acrolein selectivity increased as the O2
pressure increased from 1.0 to 2.0 kPa, but decreased with
a further increase in O2 pressure.
As shown in Fig. 12, at a constant O2 partial pressure, the
increase in C3H8 pressure did not significantly change C3H8
conversion, and the C3H8 conversion rate increased almost
linearly with C3H8 pressure except for the point of 30 kPa
at which the O2 conversion exceeded 50% (Fig. 12A).
This observation suggests a first-order dependence of C3H8
conversion rate on the partial pressure of C3H8. At low
C3H8 pressure, CO2 was mainly formed along with a small
amount of acrolein (Fig. 12B). The increase in C3H8 pres-
sure decreased the selectivity to CO2 and increased those
to acrolein and C3H6.
The results described above suggest that acrolein is pro-
duced through the oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate
adsorbed on a catalyst surface since the increase in O2 pres-
sure increased the selectivity to acrolein but decreased that
to C3H6 at very low O2 pressure (Fig. 11B). At low tem-
peratures, CO2 was formed as a main product (Fig. 10B)
probably due to further oxidation of acrolein to CO2 on a
catalyst surface. The increase in temperature may enhance
the desorption of acrolein or C3H6 and thus increase the
selectivity to acrolein (Fig. 10B). Since CO began to appear
at high temperatures (Fig. 10B) or high C3H8 conversion

Catalytic Oxidation of Isobutane
Figure 13 compares the catalytic performances of TIE
and DHT samples in the oxidation of i-C4H10 at 500C.
MCM-41 without vanadium gave i-C4H10 conversion of
5.5%. For TIE samples, i-C4H10 conversion increased with
increasing vanadium content and was saturated as vana-
dium content exceeded 2 wt% due to the complete con-
sumption of O2. The main products were CO and CO2, and
the selectivity to partial oxidation products, i.e., i-C4H8 and
methacrolein, was lower than 15%. Over DHT samples,
i-C4H10 conversion increased more remarkably with in-
creasing vanadium content up to 2 wt%, although a further
increase in vanadium content decreased the conversion.
Moreover, i-C4H8 was formed with selectivity of ca. 50%
over the DHT samples as the vanadium content exceeded
1wt%,whichwasmuchhigherthanthoseovertheTIEsam-
ples. Interestingly, similar to C3H8 oxidation, methacrolein,
the product of allylic oxidation, was also formed with mod-
erate selectivity (ca. 20%) over DHT samples with lower
vanadium content.
Comparison of the Reactions over TIE and DHT Catalysts
(a) TIE catalysts.
The tendencies of the change of alkane
conversion versus vanadium content over these samples
are very similar (Figs. 7A, 9A, and 13A); the conver-
sions are all increased with vanadium content and satu-
rated due to the consumption of O2 at high vanadium
content. Further comparisons with the DHT catalysts tend
tosuggestthattheTIEcatalystsshowhigheractivity(higher
alkane conversion or O2 conversion) under the same reac-
tion conditions. This is probably also related to the redox
properties of vanadium species in these two kinds of cata-
lysts. As described in Fig. 5, the vanadium species in TIE
catalysts could be reduced more easily.
In the cases of C2H6 and C3H8 oxidation, moderate se-
lectivities to their alkenes, viz., approximately 50 and 40%
to C2H4 and C3H6, respectively, were obtained over the
TIE samples as vanadium content exceeded 1 wt%, and
these selectivities were almost held with a further increase
in vanadium content. This must be caused by the high dis-
persion of vanadium species on the wall of MCM-41 in these
samples, which has been indicated by the results of diffuse
reflectance UVvis (Fig. 3), laser Raman (Fig. 4), and H2-
TPR (Fig. 5) studies. However, it should be noted that these
TIE samples showed very low selectivity in the oxidative
dehydrogenation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8. This must be due to
FIG. 13.

the higher reactivity of i-C4H10 as compared with that of
C2H6 and C3H8. It is likely that not only consecutive ox-
idation of i-C4H8 but also the direct oxidation of i-C4H10
to CO and CO2 occurs over the TIE catalysts since high
selectivity cannot be obtained over these catalysts, even at
very low i-C4H10 conversion. Thus, weaker or more isolated
catalytic sites, as in the case of DHT catalysts, are needed
to achieve higher selectivity to i-C4H8.
(b) DHT catalysts.
The variations of alkane conversion
as a function of vanadium content over these samples also
resembled each other in essence (Figs. 7B, 9B, and 13B).
The decrease in conversion was observed in all cases as the
vanadium content exceeded a certain amount. The drop in
specific surface area (Fig. 2) and the decrease in the regu-
larity of mesoporous structure with vanadium content ex-
ceeding 2 wt% (Figs. 1 and 2) may be two of the reasons.
Furthermore, since a large part of vanadium atoms were in-
corporated inside the framework of MCM-41 in DHT sam-
ples as indicated by UVvis, laser Raman, and TPR studies,
it can be speculated that only those that remained on the
surface or accessible to reactants can work as active sites in
the reaction. This may be the other reason why the conver-
sions of C2H6 and C3H8 did not increase remarkably with
increasing vanadium content, as in the case of TIE catalysts.
It should be stressed that the DHT samples showed very
different catalytic properties toward C2H6 and C3H8 or i-
C4H10. As shown in Fig. 7B, the DHT samples with high
vanadium content are not appropriate for oxidative dehy-
drogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, but they are selective for
the formations of C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the oxidations of
C3H8 and i-C4H10 (Figs. 9B, 9C, and 13B). Although we
cannot provide an unambiguous explanation at this mo-
ment, it seems that this may arise from the difference in the
oxidation of C2H6 and that of C3H8 or i-C4H10. Generally,
the activation of C2H6 requires more active catalytic species
than that for C3H8 or i-C4H10. Thus, only the isolation of
vanadium sites from each other may not be necessary to
obtain high C2H4 selectivity. L
opez Nieto and co-workers
(25) reported that the selectivity to C2H4 was also related
to the presence of acid sites for the oxidation of C2H6 over
MgVAPO-5. The lower acidity of the DHT catalysts with
high vanadium content (Fig. 6B) may be related to their
lower C2H4 selectivity.
For the oxidation of C3H8 or i-C4H10, higher selectivity
to C3H6 or i-C4H8 was obtained over the DHT samples,
probably due to the higher isolation of vanadium sites in
these samples. In the case of C3H8 oxidation, C3H6 selec-
tivity of 60% could be obtained at C3H8 conversion of 16%
over the DHT catalyst with a Si/V ratio of 40 at 550C. At
532C, a V-containing zeolite, Vsilicalite-1 (VS-1), gave
C3H8 conversion of ca. 22% and C3H6 selectivity of ca.
45% (5). Thus, the best yield of C3H6 over the VMCM 41
was comparable to that obtained over the VS-1. However,
the rate of C3H6 formation was ca. 8 mmol g1 h1 over
the VMCM-41, which was higher than that over the VS-1
(ca. 1 mmol g1 h1).
Besides alkenes, the products of allylic oxidation, i.e.,
acrolein and methacrolein, were also formed respectively
with considerable selectivity over the DHT samples with
low vanadium content. It should be noted that oxygenate
was not formed in the oxidation of C2H6. This could be
explained by assuming that the oxygenate formed in the
oxidation of C3H8 and of i-C4H10 results from the allylic
oxidation of the alkenes or allylic intermediates since no
such allylic oxidation can occur in the case of C2H4. The re-
sults obtained by changing reaction conditions in C3H8 ox-
idation (Figs. 1012) also support that acrolein is produced
from the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate
on a catalyst surface.
On the other hand, it should be mentioned that the for-
mation of acrolein was not observed over V-substituted ze-
olites such as VS-1, although they were also effective in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6. Thus, the fea-
tures of MCM-41, such as pore structure or specific acidic
properties, may have relations with the reaction. The acid
sites with medium strength which remained over the DHT
samples with low vanadium content (Fig. 6B) and the spe-
cific pore structure of these samples might contribute to the
adsorption of C3H6 or i-C4H8 intermediate and thus the for-
mation of acrolein or methacrolein. The disappearance of
such acid sites with further increasing vanadium content
decreased the selectivity to acrolein and increased that to
C3H6.
CONCLUSIONS
The vanadium species introduced by the template-ion-
exchange method were mainly dispersed on the wall of
MCM-41 in the state of monomeric tetrahedral coordina-
tion, while the direct hydrothermal method led to vanadium
sites mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM-
41. During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conver-
sion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vana-
dium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities
to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, re-
spectively) were almost held simultaneously. TIE catalysts,
however, were not selective for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to
i-C4H8. The conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10 also in-
creased with introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by the
DHT method, but the decrease in conversion was observed
as the vanadium content became high. The DHT catalysts
showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation
of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and
i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C,
respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and
i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content ex-
ceeding 1.0 wt%. Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and
methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts

with lower vanadium content in the same reactions. The
highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity
approaching 20%. At low O2 pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa),
the sum of the selectivities to C3H6 and acrolein could reach
95 and 87% with C3H8 conversions of 3.0 and 4.4%, re-
spectively. Acrolein is probably formed by the allylic ox-
idation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the acid sites
with medium strength in the catalyst are suggested to play
roles in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate and
thus contribute to the formation of acrolein.
