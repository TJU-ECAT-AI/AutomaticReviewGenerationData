[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state."

[5] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[6] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

The use of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows potential advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly at low concentrations. When used as a gas dope in small amounts (300 ppm), N2O improves the yield and selectivity to propylene while decreasing propane conversion. This is attributed to N2O inducing a reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface, which leads to catalytic sites working in a more reduced state.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate. The mechanism by which N2O improves selectivity involves inhibiting O2 adsorption on the catalyst surface, slowing down the reoxidation rate. This results in the catalyst operating in a more reduced state, which is beneficial for propylene selectivity.

However, critical challenges emerge with higher concentrations of N2O (1-10% volume). At these levels, propylene selectivity decreases, and the catalyst becomes more deeply reduced, leading to the formation of carbonaceous products. This suggests that catalyst deactivation and stability are significant issues when using higher concentrations of N2O.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimizing N2O concentration: Finding the optimal concentration of N2O that balances improved selectivity with minimal catalyst deactivation.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to deep reduction and carbon deposition when exposed to higher concentrations of N2O.

3. Co-feed strategies: Investigating the use of N2O in combination with O2 or other oxidants to maintain catalyst stability while benefiting from N2O's selectivity-enhancing effects.

4. Regeneration techniques: Developing efficient methods to regenerate catalysts that have been deactivated by carbonaceous deposits.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conducting in-depth research to better understand the interaction between N2O and the catalyst surface, which could lead to more targeted catalyst improvements.

6. Reactor design: Exploring reactor configurations that optimize the contact between N2O, the catalyst, and the reactants while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial applications.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)过程中使用N2O作为氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面显示出潜在优势，特别是在低浓度下。当作为气体掺杂剂使用少量(300 ppm)时，N2O可以提高丙烯的产率和选择性，同时降低丙烷的转化率。这是由于N2O诱导催化剂表面的Mo还原，使催化活性位点在更还原的状态下工作。

本研究讨论的主要催化剂是镍钼酸盐。N2O提高选择性的机制涉及抑制O2在催化剂表面的吸附，从而减缓催化剂的再氧化速率。这导致催化剂在更还原的状态下运行，有利于丙烯的选择性。

然而，在较高浓度的N2O(1-10%体积)下出现了关键挑战。在这些水平下，丙烯选择性下降，催化剂被更深度还原，导致碳质产物的形成。这表明在使用较高浓度的N2O时，催化剂失活和稳定性是重要问题。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O浓度：找到平衡提高选择性和最小化催化剂失活的最佳N2O浓度。

2. 催化剂设计：开发在暴露于较高浓度N2O时更能抵抗深度还原和碳沉积的催化剂。

3. 共进料策略：研究N2O与O2或其他氧化剂的组合使用，以维持催化剂稳定性，同时受益于N2O的选择性增强效果。

4. 再生技术：开发有效方法来再生被碳质沉积物失活的催化剂。

5. 机理研究：进行深入研究，以更好地理解N2O和催化剂表面之间的相互作用，这可能导致更有针对性的催化剂改进。

6. 反应器设计：探索优化N2O、催化剂和反应物之间接触的反应器配置，同时最小化不必要的副反应。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP目前的限制，使其成为工业应用的更可行选择。
