[1] "The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances. At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[2] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[3] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

The use of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows some advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly at low concentrations. When used in small amounts (around 300 ppm), N2O improves the yield and selectivity of propylene while decreasing propane conversion. This is attributed to N2O's ability to induce the reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface, which inhibits O2 adsorption and slows down catalyst reoxidation.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate (NiMoO4). The research shows that N2O allows the catalytic sites to work in a more reduced state, which is beneficial for selectivity at low N2O concentrations.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. At higher N2O concentrations (1-10% by volume), the selectivity to propylene decreases, and the catalyst becomes more deeply reduced. This leads to the formation of carbonaceous products, which can cause catalyst deactivation over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimize N2O concentration: Find the optimal N2O concentration that balances improved selectivity with minimal catalyst reduction and carbon formation.

2. Develop more stable catalysts: Research into catalyst formulations that are more resistant to deep reduction and carbon formation in the presence of N2O.

3. Explore co-feed strategies: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with O2 or other oxidants to maintain catalyst stability while benefiting from N2O's selectivity-enhancing properties.

4. Study reaction kinetics: Conduct detailed kinetic studies to better understand the interplay between N2O, O2, and the catalyst surface to optimize reaction conditions.

5. Investigate regeneration methods: Develop efficient catalyst regeneration techniques to remove carbonaceous deposits and restore catalyst activity.

6. Explore pulsed reaction systems: Consider pulsed reaction systems that alternate between N2O and O2 feeds to balance selectivity improvement with catalyst stability.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)过程中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面显示出一些优势，特别是在低浓度下。当使用少量(约300 ppm)时，N2O提高了丙烯的产率和选择性，同时降低了丙烷的转化率。这归因于N2O能够诱导催化剂表面Mo的还原，从而抑制O2的吸附并减缓催化剂的再氧化速率。

本研究中讨论的主要催化剂是钼酸镍(NiMoO4)。研究表明，N2O允许催化活性位在更还原的状态下工作，这在低N2O浓度下有利于选择性。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性方面存在关键挑战。在较高的N2O浓度(1-10%体积)下，丙烯的选择性下降，催化剂变得更深度还原。这导致碳质产物的形成，随时间推移可能造成催化剂失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O浓度：找到平衡提高选择性与最小化催化剂还原和碳形成的最佳N2O浓度。

2. 开发更稳定的催化剂：研究在N2O存在下更耐深度还原和碳形成的催化剂配方。

3. 探索共进料策略：研究N2O与O2或其他氧化剂的组合使用，以维持催化剂稳定性，同时受益于N2O的选择性增强特性。

4. 研究反应动力学：进行详细的动力学研究，以更好地理解N2O、O2和催化剂表面之间的相互作用，优化反应条件。

5. 研究再生方法：开发有效的催化剂再生技术，以去除碳质沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

6. 探索脉冲反应系统：考虑在N2O和O2进料之间交替的脉冲反应系统，以平衡选择性改进和催化剂稳定性。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择。
