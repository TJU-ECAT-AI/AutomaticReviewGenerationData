[1] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved. Decreases in the oxygen consumption, in the yield and in the selectivity in CO2 were also observed."

[3] "Comparing Tests T 5% O2 and T 0% O2 + 10% N2O (namely, both tests containing the same oxygen in the feed), it is concluded that in presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7% compared with 20.6%, respectively)."

[4] "When the amount of N2O is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very similar to those observed without N2O and the yield and selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly lower."

[5] "However, the situation is more complex. Under a high N2O concentration, the catalyst is deeply reduced and a big amount of carbonaceous products is simultaneously formed. On the other hand, too reduced catalysts are less active for propane transformation."

[6] "These observations show that, the good performance observed in the formation of propylene from propane with pure N2O is probably not stable on time and that the catalysts would be further deactivated with time on stream."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly molecular oxygen. N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface, which inhibits O2 adsorption and slows down catalyst reoxidation. This leads to improved propylene selectivity and yield, especially at low N2O concentrations.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate (NiMoO4). When using pure N2O instead of O2, the catalyst shows higher selectivity towards propylene formation (28.7% vs 20.6%) at similar conversion rates. Additionally, N2O-ODHP results in lower CO2 formation, indicating better selectivity towards the desired product.

However, critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are evident. At higher N2O concentrations, the catalyst becomes deeply reduced, leading to the formation of carbonaceous products. This reduction can cause the catalyst to become less active for propane transformation over time. The good performance observed with pure N2O is likely not stable over extended periods, and catalyst deactivation is expected with prolonged use.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimizing N2O concentration: Finding the optimal N2O concentration that balances improved selectivity with minimal catalyst reduction and deactivation.

2. Developing more stable catalysts: Research into catalyst formulations that are more resistant to deep reduction and carbonaceous product formation under N2O-rich conditions.

3. Periodic regeneration: Implementing cyclic processes that allow for catalyst regeneration to remove carbonaceous deposits and restore activity.

4. Mixed oxidant approach: Exploring the use of N2O in combination with O2 or CO2 to balance the oxidation state of the catalyst and maintain stability.

5. Surface modification: Investigating surface treatments or promoters that can enhance the catalyst's resistance to deep reduction while maintaining selectivity benefits.

6. In-situ characterization: Developing techniques for real-time monitoring of catalyst oxidation state to better understand and control the process dynamics.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial application.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)过程中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面显示出几个优势，特别是与分子氧相比。N2O诱导催化剂表面的Mo还原，抑制O2吸附并减缓催化剂再氧化速率。这导致丙烯选择性和产率提高，尤其是在低N2O浓度下。

本研究讨论的主要催化剂是钼酸镍(NiMoO4)。与O2相比，使用纯N2O时，催化剂在相似的转化率下显示出更高的丙烯形成选择性(28.7%对20.6%)。此外，N2O-ODHP产生较少的CO2，表明对目标产物的选择性更好。

然而，与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战是显而易见的。在较高的N2O浓度下，催化剂变得深度还原，导致碳质产物的形成。这种还原可能导致催化剂随时间推移对丙烷转化的活性降低。纯N2O观察到的良好性能可能在长时间内不稳定，预计长期使用会导致催化剂失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O浓度：找到平衡改善选择性和最小化催化剂还原和失活的最佳N2O浓度。

2. 开发更稳定的催化剂：研究在富N2O条件下更能抵抗深度还原和碳质产物形成的催化剂配方。

3. 周期性再生：实施允许催化剂再生以去除碳质沉积物并恢复活性的循环过程。

4. 混合氧化剂方法：探索将N2O与O2或CO2组合使用，以平衡催化剂的氧化状态并保持稳定性。

5. 表面改性：研究可以增强催化剂抗深度还原能力同时保持选择性优势的表面处理或促进剂。

6. 原位表征：开发实时监测催化剂氧化状态的技术，以更好地理解和控制过程动力学。

这些研究方向可能克服当前的限制，使N2O-ODHP成为工业应用的更可行选择。
