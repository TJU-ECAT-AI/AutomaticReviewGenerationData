[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state."

[5] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[6] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[7] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. At low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O improves propylene yield and selectivity while decreasing propane conversion.

2. N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface, which leads to catalytic sites working in a more reduced state. This reduction is believed to occur through the inhibition of O2 adsorption, slowing down the catalyst reoxidation rate.

3. The reduced state of the catalyst promoted by N2O is associated with improved selectivity.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate. The research focuses on how N2O affects the oxidation state and performance of this catalyst.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. At higher N2O concentrations (1-10%), the selectivity to propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products are formed on the deeply reduced catalyst surface.

2. The formation of carbonaceous products can lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

3. While propylene can be produced from propane in the presence of pure N2O, this process is likely unstable and requires the presence of molecular oxygen for durability.

Strategies or research directions to address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation include:

1. Optimizing the N2O concentration to balance the beneficial effects of catalyst reduction with the negative impacts of excessive reduction and carbon formation.

2. Investigating the synergistic effects of combining N2O with other oxidants or promoters (e.g., CO2) to fine-tune the catalyst's oxidation state and performance.

3. Developing more stable catalysts that can maintain their selectivity and activity under N2O-rich conditions without rapid deactivation.

4. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration methods for catalysts used in N2O-ODHP to address the issue of carbonaceous product formation.

5. Exploring the potential of using N2O in combination with molecular oxygen to create a more stable and selective ODHP process.

6. Investigating the mechanisms of N2O interaction with different catalyst compositions to design more efficient and stable catalytic systems for ODHP.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 在低浓度（300 ppm）下，N2O可提高丙烯产率和选择性，同时降低丙烷转化率。

2. N2O诱导催化剂表面Mo的还原，使催化活性位在更还原的状态下工作。这种还原被认为是通过抑制O2的吸附实现的，从而减缓了催化剂的再氧化速率。

3. N2O促进的催化剂还原状态与提高的选择性相关。

本研究主要讨论的催化剂是钼酸镍。研究重点是N2O如何影响该催化剂的氧化状态和性能。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 在较高的N2O浓度（1-10%）下，丙烯的选择性下降，深度还原的催化剂表面形成碳质产物。

2. 碳质产物的形成可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

3. 虽然在纯N2O存在下可以从丙烷生产丙烯，但这个过程可能不稳定，需要分子氧的存在才能持久。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具实际应用可行性，可采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化N2O浓度，平衡催化剂还原的有利效果与过度还原和碳形成的负面影响。

2. 研究N2O与其他氧化剂或助剂（如CO2）的协同效应，以精细调节催化剂的氧化状态和性能。

3. 开发更稳定的催化剂，在富N2O条件下保持其选择性和活性，而不会快速失活。

4. 研究N2O-ODHP中使用的催化剂的长期稳定性和再生方法，以解决碳质产物形成的问题。

5. 探索将N2O与分子氧结合使用的潜力，以创造更稳定和选择性的ODHP过程。

6. 研究N2O与不同催化剂组成的相互作用机理，以设计更高效、更稳定的ODHP催化系统。
