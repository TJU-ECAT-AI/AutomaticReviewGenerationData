[1] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7)."

[2] "As shown in Table 3 the relative concentration of V5+ decreases from 100 to 66%, while that of V4+ and V3+ increases from 0 to 26% and from 0 to 8%, respectively, when the ODP reaction is performed with a partial oxygen pressure of 10 kPa instead of 20 kPa."

[3] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

[4] "The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

[5] "It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

The use of N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly O2:

1. Improved propylene selectivity: N2O leads to higher initial propylene selectivity and reduces direct propane oxidation to CO and CO2, as well as consecutive propylene oxidation to COx.

2. Lower oxidation state of vanadium: N2O results in a lower average oxidation state of bulk and near-surface vanadium (+3.9 to +4.4) compared to O2, which maintains vanadium in a higher oxidation state (+5).

3. Different oxygen species: The nature of oxygen species originating from N2O differs from those from O2, potentially playing a role in reducing consecutive propylene oxidation and direct propane oxidation.

The study primarily focused on vanadium-based catalysts (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts undergo significant restructuring under reaction conditions, with their final composition determined by the oxidizing agent used.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the study mentions reaction-induced changes in the catalysts, which could potentially impact long-term stability.

To address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, future research directions could include:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain a stable, partially reduced state under reaction conditions to optimize propylene selectivity.

2. Investigating the nature of oxygen species formed from N2O and their role in the reaction mechanism to further improve selectivity.

3. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions and developing strategies to mitigate deactivation.

4. Exploring mixed-metal oxide catalysts or supported vanadium catalysts that may offer improved performance and stability in N2O-ODHP.

5. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to maximize propylene yield while maintaining catalyst stability.

6. Investigating the economic and environmental aspects of using N2O as an oxidant on an industrial scale, including N2O production and handling.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）中使用N2O作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与O2相比：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：N2O导致更高的初始丙烯选择性，并减少直接丙烷氧化生成CO和CO2，以及连续丙烯氧化生成COx。

2. 钒的较低氧化态：与O2相比，N2O导致体相和近表面钒的平均氧化态较低（+3.9至+4.4），而O2使钒保持在较高的氧化态（+5）。

3. 不同的氧物种：源自N2O的氧物种的性质与O2不同，可能在减少连续丙烯氧化和直接丙烷氧化方面起作用。

该研究主要集中在N2O-ODHP的钒基催化剂（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）上。这些催化剂在反应条件下经历显著的重构，其最终组成由所使用的氧化剂决定。

给定的文献中没有明确讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，研究提到了催化剂在反应条件下的变化，这可能会影响长期稳定性。

为了解决限制并使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更可行，未来的研究方向可能包括：

1. 开发在反应条件下保持稳定、部分还原状态的催化剂，以优化丙烯选择性。

2. 研究由N2O形成的氧物种的性质及其在反应机理中的作用，以进一步提高选择性。

3. 研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性，并开发减缓失活的策略。

4. 探索在N2O-ODHP中可能提供更好性能和稳定性的混合金属氧化物催化剂或负载型钒催化剂。

5. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）以最大化丙烯产率，同时保持催化剂稳定性。

6. 研究在工业规模上使用N2O作为氧化剂的经济和环境方面，包括N2O的生产和处理。
