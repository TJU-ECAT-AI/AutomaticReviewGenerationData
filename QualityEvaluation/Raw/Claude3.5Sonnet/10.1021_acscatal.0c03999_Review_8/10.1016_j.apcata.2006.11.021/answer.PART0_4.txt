[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODP), vanadium- and molybdenum-based oxide catalysts belong to the best-performing catalytic materials using O2 as oxidizing agent. Unfortunately, the present-day catalytic materials suffer from low propene selectivities at high degrees of propane conversion due to higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

[2] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over VOx/g-Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] catalytic materials it was demonstrated that propene selectivity could be increased when O2 was replaced by N2O. The most significant improvements in propene selectivity (up to three times) were achieved for the sample possessing bulk like V2O5 species."

[3] "It was suggested that the improved ODP performance with N2O was due to the lower ability of N2O for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species, i.e. the degree of catalyst reduction in the presence of N2O is higher than in the presence of O2."

[4] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7). At this stage it is important to stress that the amount of oxygen atoms in the C3H8O2 and C3H8N2O feed mixtures was the same (see Section 2.2). Taking into account this experimental condition, the lower oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium in the presence of N2O as compared to O2 is related to the lower oxidizing ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxides (Eq. (3))."

[5] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O. The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased propylene selectivity: Studies have shown that replacing O2 with N2O can significantly increase propylene selectivity, with improvements of up to three times observed in some cases.

2. Reduced consecutive oxidation: N2O reduces both direct propane oxidation to CO and CO2 and consecutive propylene oxidation to COx, leading to higher overall propylene yields.

3. Lower oxidizing ability: N2O has a lower ability to re-oxidize reduced catalyst species compared to O2, resulting in a higher degree of catalyst reduction. This higher reduction state of the catalyst is associated with improved propylene selectivity.

4. Maintaining lower oxidation states: The use of N2O helps maintain lower oxidation states of vanadium in the catalyst (between +3.9 and +4.4), which is beneficial for propylene selectivity.

Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, including:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts: VOx/γ-Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41
2. Bulk vanadium oxides: V2O3, VO2, and V2O5

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP are not explicitly mentioned in the given literature. However, based on the information provided, some potential challenges and strategies to address them can be inferred:

1. Catalyst reduction: While a higher degree of catalyst reduction is beneficial for selectivity, it may lead to catalyst deactivation over time. Research could focus on developing catalysts that maintain an optimal reduction state without compromising long-term stability.

2. Optimizing N2O decomposition: Since N2O decomposition is crucial for generating active oxygen species, research could aim to enhance the catalyst's ability to decompose N2O efficiently while maintaining selectivity.

3. Tuning catalyst composition: Further studies on the effect of different vanadium oxidation states and their stability under reaction conditions could lead to the development of more stable and selective catalysts.

4. Investigating support materials: Research into novel support materials that can stabilize the active vanadium species in their optimal oxidation state could improve catalyst longevity and performance.

5. Process optimization: Developing strategies to control the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to maintain the optimal catalyst state and prevent deactivation could enhance the practicality of N2O-ODHP.

6. Regeneration techniques: Exploring efficient methods to regenerate partially deactivated catalysts without compromising their selectivity could extend catalyst lifetime and improve process economics.

By addressing these challenges and focusing on the proposed research directions, N2O-ODHP could become a more feasible option for practical implementation in propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气(O2)相比：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：研究表明，用N2O替代O2可以显著提高丙烯选择性，在某些情况下观察到的改进可达三倍。

2. 减少连续氧化：N2O减少了丙烷直接氧化成CO和CO2以及丙烯连续氧化成COx的反应，从而导致更高的总体丙烯产率。

3. 较低的氧化能力：与O2相比，N2O重新氧化还原催化剂物种的能力较低，导致催化剂还原程度更高。催化剂的这种较高还原状态与改善的丙烯选择性有关。

4. 维持较低的氧化状态：使用N2O有助于维持催化剂中钒的较低氧化状态（介于+3.9和+4.4之间），这对丙烯选择性有利。

在N2O-ODHP过程中使用了各种催化剂，包括：

1. 钒基催化剂：VOx/γ-Al2O3和VOx/MCM-41
2. 块状钒氧化物：V2O3、VO2和V2O5

给定的文献中没有明确提到N2O-ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，根据所提供的信息，可以推断出一些潜在的挑战和解决策略：

1. 催化剂还原：虽然更高程度的催化剂还原有利于选择性，但随着时间的推移可能导致催化剂失活。研究可以集中在开发能够保持最佳还原状态而不影响长期稳定性的催化剂上。

2. 优化N2O分解：由于N2O分解对于产生活性氧物种至关重要，研究可以旨在提高催化剂高效分解N2O的能力，同时保持选择性。

3. 调整催化剂组成：进一步研究不同钒氧化状态及其在反应条件下的稳定性，可能导致开发出更稳定和选择性的催化剂。

4. 研究载体材料：研究新型载体材料，能够将活性钒物种稳定在其最佳氧化状态，可以提高催化剂的寿命和性能。

5. 工艺优化：开发控制反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）的策略，以维持最佳催化剂状态并防止失活，可以提高N2O-ODHP的实用性。

6. 再生技术：探索有效的方法来再生部分失活的催化剂，而不影响其选择性，可以延长催化剂寿命并改善工艺经济性。

通过解决这些挑战并专注于提出的研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际实施选择。
