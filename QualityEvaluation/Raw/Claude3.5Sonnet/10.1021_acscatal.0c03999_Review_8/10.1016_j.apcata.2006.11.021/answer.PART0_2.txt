[1] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7)."

[2] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

[3] "The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

[4] "It is suggested that the difference in the oxidation state of vanadium with O2 and N2O is related to the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species as compared to O2."

[5] "Moreover, individual vanadium oxides poorly performing with O2 become selective in the ODP reaction using N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O leads to improved initial propylene selectivity compared to O2. This is attributed to the reduced direct propane oxidation to CO and CO2, as well as decreased consecutive propylene oxidation to COx.

2. Lower oxidation state of vanadium: N2O results in a lower average oxidation state of bulk and near-surface vanadium after the ODP reaction, ranging between +3.9 and +4.4. This reduced state of vanadium is associated with higher propylene selectivity.

3. Improved performance of vanadium oxide catalysts: Some vanadium oxide catalysts that perform poorly with O2 become selective when using N2O as the oxidant.

4. Milder oxidizing ability: N2O has a lower ability to reoxidize reduced vanadium oxide species compared to O2, which contributes to maintaining the catalyst in a more reduced state.

The study primarily focused on individual vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) as catalysts for the N2O-ODHP process. These catalysts showed improved performance with N2O compared to O2.

However, the literature does not explicitly discuss critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. To address potential limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop more stable vanadium-based catalysts or explore other metal oxide catalysts that maintain their reduced state under N2O-ODHP conditions.

2. Reaction condition optimization: Investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene yield.

3. Catalyst regeneration methods: Develop efficient techniques to regenerate the catalyst and maintain its activity over extended periods.

4. Support material research: Explore various support materials that can enhance the stability and selectivity of the active vanadium species.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth investigations into the reaction mechanism of N2O-ODHP to better understand and control the factors affecting catalyst stability and selectivity.

6. Process integration: Investigate the potential for integrating N2O-ODHP with other processes to improve overall efficiency and economic viability.

7. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended stability tests to identify and address factors contributing to catalyst deactivation over time.

These research directions could help overcome the limitations of the N2O-ODHP process and potentially make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有以下几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：与O2相比，N2O可以提高初始丙烯选择性。这是由于直接丙烷氧化生成CO和CO2的反应减少，以及连续丙烯氧化生成COx的反应也减少。

2. 钒的氧化态较低：使用N2O后，ODP反应后体相和近表面钒的平均氧化态降低到+3.9至+4.4之间。钒的这种还原态与更高的丙烯选择性相关。

3. 改善钒氧化物催化剂的性能：某些在O2中表现不佳的钒氧化物催化剂在使用N2O作为氧化剂时变得具有选择性。

4. 较温和的氧化能力：与O2相比，N2O重新氧化还原态钒氧化物物种的能力较低，这有助于保持催化剂处于更还原的状态。

该研究主要关注了单一钒氧化物（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）作为N2O-ODHP过程的催化剂。这些催化剂在使用N2O时比使用O2时表现更好。

然而，文献并未明确讨论N2O-ODHP过程中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。为了解决潜在的限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发更稳定的钒基催化剂或探索在N2O-ODHP条件下能保持还原态的其他金属氧化物催化剂。

2. 反应条件优化：研究温度、压力和进料组成对催化剂稳定性和丙烯产率的影响。

3. 催化剂再生方法：开发有效的技术来再生催化剂并在长期使用中保持其活性。

4. 载体材料研究：探索各种可以提高活性钒物种稳定性和选择性的载体材料。

5. 机理研究：对N2O-ODHP的反应机理进行更深入的研究，以更好地理解和控制影响催化剂稳定性和选择性的因素。

6. 过程集成：研究将N2O-ODHP与其他过程集成的潜力，以提高整体效率和经济可行性。

7. 长期稳定性研究：进行长期稳定性测试，以识别和解决导致催化剂随时间失活的因素。

这些研究方向可以帮助克服N2O-ODHP过程的局限性，并有可能使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
