[1] "Upon replacing of O2 by N2O, the average oxidation state of bulk and near surface vanadium after the ODP reaction decreases to between +3.9 and +4.4 (Fig. 7)."

[2] "As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

[3] "The corresponding improved initial C3H6 selectivity can be related to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites; the higher the degree, the higher the selectivity."

[4] "It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."

[5] "For all the studied vanadium oxides using C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 and C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 reaction feeds. When the oxygen partial pressure decreases from 20 to 10 kPa, the initial propene selectivity increases and is close to that with 40 kPa of N2O."

[6] "However, the catalyst ability for consecutive propene oxidation is not influenced by the oxygen partial pressures. Consecutive propene oxidation is significantly lower when O2 is replaced by N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O leads to improved initial propylene selectivity compared to O2. This is attributed to the lower oxidation state of vanadium catalysts when using N2O.

2. Reduced direct propane combustion: The use of N2O drastically reduces direct propane oxidation to CO and CO2, which are undesirable side products.

3. Decreased consecutive propylene oxidation: N2O significantly lowers the consecutive oxidation of propylene to COx, preserving more of the desired product.

4. Lower oxidation state of catalysts: N2O maintains vanadium catalysts in a more reduced state compared to O2, which correlates with higher propylene selectivity.

5. Different oxygen species: The nature of oxygen species derived from N2O differs from those from O2, potentially contributing to improved selectivity.

The study primarily focused on vanadium-based catalysts (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts showed dynamic changes in their oxidation states and surface compositions under reaction conditions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the study emphasized the importance of understanding reaction-induced changes in catalyst composition and structure.

To address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that maintain a stable, partially reduced state under reaction conditions to maximize propylene selectivity.

2. Reaction engineering: Optimize reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to balance catalyst activity and selectivity.

3. In-depth mechanistic studies: Further investigate the nature of oxygen species derived from N2O and their role in selective oxidation.

4. Catalyst stability studies: Conduct long-term stability tests to identify and address deactivation mechanisms specific to N2O-ODHP.

5. Process integration: Explore ways to efficiently produce or recycle N2O for the process, addressing potential cost and environmental concerns.

6. Mixed oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to optimize performance and economics.

These research directions could potentially overcome current limitations and enhance the practical viability of N2O-ODHP for industrial applications.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面提供了几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：与O2相比，N2O能够提高初始丙烯选择性。这归因于使用N2O时钒催化剂的氧化态较低。

2. 减少直接丙烷燃烧：使用N2O大大减少了丙烷直接氧化成CO和CO2的不良副产物。

3. 降低连续丙烯氧化：N2O显著降低了丙烯连续氧化成COx的程度，保留了更多的目标产物。

4. 催化剂氧化态较低：与O2相比，N2O使钒催化剂保持在更还原的状态，这与更高的丙烯选择性相关。

5. 不同的氧物种：从N2O衍生的氧物种的性质与O2不同，可能有助于提高选择性。

该研究主要关注了N2O-ODHP中的钒基催化剂（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）。这些催化剂在反应条件下表现出动态的氧化态和表面成分变化。

提供的文献中并未直接讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，该研究强调了理解反应引起的催化剂成分和结构变化的重要性。

为了解决限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发在反应条件下能保持稳定、部分还原状态的催化剂，以最大化丙烯选择性。

2. 反应工程：优化反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）以平衡催化剂活性和选择性。

3. 深入的机理研究：进一步研究从N2O衍生的氧物种的性质及其在选择性氧化中的作用。

4. 催化剂稳定性研究：进行长期稳定性测试，以识别和解决N2O-ODHP特有的失活机制。

5. 过程集成：探索高效生产或回收N2O的方法，解决潜在的成本和环境问题。

6. 混合氧化剂系统：研究N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用，以优化性能和经济性。

这些研究方向可能有助于克服当前的限制，提高N2O-ODHP在工业应用中的实际可行性。
