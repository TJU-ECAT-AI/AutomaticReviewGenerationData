Abstract
We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. The addition of N2O modifies the catalytic performances. At
low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity
to propylene is improved. Decreases in the oxygen consumption, in the yield and in the selectivity in CO2 were also observed.
N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption
of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst.
In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state. At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the
selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more
deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed. These observations are interpreted as being due to the inhibition effect
evoked at low concentration but additionally to a direct reduction of the catalytic surface brought about by N2O. Propylene is
produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably
needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably. This work shows that adjusting the concentration of
promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the
catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances.

of gas dopes into the feed in industrial applications
takes an increasing importance, principally because
gas dopes could improve activity and selectivity
and inhibit non desirable reactions and deactivation.
However, scarce information is available from the lit-
erature on the exact role that dopes could play during
the catalytic reaction. Fundamentals studies are thus
of high priority in this field. A better understanding
of the mechanistic processes in presence of dopes is
necessary to understand the real state of the catalysts
during the catalytic reaction, to control the oxidation

state of the catalysts during reaction and to improve
selectivity of the reaction [13].
Many alternative processes could be expected to ex-
plain the modification in the catalytic activity due to
the addition of dopes, however, there is currently a
lack of experimental confirmation of these processes.
Gas dopes could be adsorbed on the surface of the
catalysts. The possibilities that co-adsorbate species
could modify the intrinsic activity/selectivity of the
surface and the pathways of transformation or could
play directly a role as co-catalysts have been discussed
based on indirect experimental evidences. It is claimed
that a correct understanding of the modification of
the surface reactivity and selectivity of mixed oxides
due to co-adsorbate species is a necessary approach
for a better knowledge of the surface catalytic phe-
nomena [1]. We have shown that a higher selectivity
could be obtained on oxides by controlling the oxi-
dation state of the superficial atoms via an adequate
oxygen/hydrocarbon molar ratio or the surface recon-
struction of selective sites to more selective phases. In
these processes the presence of mobile surface chem-
ical species plays a decisive role [4].
Our objective is to present direct experimental re-
sults which could be useful to progress in the knowl-
edge of the role of dopes during the catalytic reaction.
Our investigation is based on the well-established fact
that the dynamic processes occurring at the surface of
oxide catalysts during oxidation reactions can modify
strongly the surface properties of the catalysts. The
understanding of the role of dopes on the activity and
selectivity of an oxidation process thus requires the
knowledge of the effects induced by all the factors
which could influence the architecture of the active
sites and the dynamic phenomena occurring at the sur-
face of the catalyst during the reaction. This has been
demonstrated in a previous paper [3] in the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane (ODP). In this paper, it
was shown that the oxidation state of molybdenum
in NiMoO4 catalysts can be tuned by adding small
amounts of CO2 in the reaction feed. It was suggested
that the mechanism by which CO2 promotes such
an oxidation is via the formation of oxygen species
at the surface (O(a)). This species would form by
the dissociative chemisorption of CO2 at the surface
of NiMoO4. Catalysts used in the presence of CO2
would thus work in a higher oxidation state, which
accounts for their improved activity and resistance
against deactivation. The stronger oxidant character
of O(a) is also consistent with the lower selectivity
of the process (as O(a) probably succeeds to oxidise
selective products) and with a lower O2 consumption
(as part of the oxygen atoms comes from CO2 and not
only from O2 anymore). Our results showed for the
first time that, in the ODP, the oxidation state of the
catalysts can be tuned by adding small amounts of gas
dopes in the reaction feed. Another important conclu-
sion of these results is the discovery that, contrary to
what is believed, and in spite of the low temperature
of the oxidation reactions performed in such a work,
CO2 is not inert in the ODP reaction. CO2 is not only
a non-selective product but it also catalyses, via O(a),
the non-selectivity of the catalyst. One important con-
clusion of this work was that it is absolutely necessary
that the role of CO2 be taken into account when inter-
preting data from reactions in which CO2 is formed.
The aim of the present contribution is to present
new results on the role of gas dopes in the control of
the real state of the catalysts during ODP reaction. It
concerns the effects brought about by the introduction
of some amounts of N2O as gas dopes in the feed dur-
ing the reaction. In our knowledge, investigations us-
ing N2O as gas dope in the oxidation of hydrocarbons,
has apparently never been presented previously in the
literature. However, N2O has been used as pure oxi-
dant: for example in the oxidative coupling of methane
to ethane [5] or formaldehyde [6], in the transforma-
tion of benzene to phenol [7] or in the oxidation of
ethylene to epoxides [8], in the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane [9]. It has been shown that N2O
is more selective than molecular oxygen [5,10]. The
explanation proposed to explain these results is based
on the fact that N2O is dissociated into N2 and atomic
oxygen, being responsible of the higher selectivity
[5,7,11].
We focus on the role played by N2O as a dope on the
control of the active sites of NiMoO4 in the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane (ODP). As N2O gener-
ates one of the two reagents and could be potentially
active itself in selective ODP, the strategy followed in
this work is first to realise the ODP in presence and
absence of a small amount of N2O and to characterise
the catalysts before and after reaction in order to cor-
relate the catalytic activity with any change occurring
on the catalyst during the reaction and to determine
the role of the addition of N2O in such changes.

Experiments were first done with an addition of
300 ppm of N2O. A second series of experiments con-
sidered the effect of increasing the amount of N2O
to 1, 5 and 10%. The objective is performing these
experiments was principally to extend and to comple-
ment the explanation of the effects observed by the
addition of small amounts of N2O and to check ex-
perimentally the possibility that N2O could perform
the selective ODP of propane. Apparently, there is no
experimental information about that in the literature.
These last experiments have not been performed in
the view to optimise the oxidative dehydrogenation
process by controlling the amount of N2O. One addi-
tional test was performed, in the absence of oxygen
but in presence of an equivalent amount of pure N2O.
This experiment was performed in order to evaluate
the oxidant character of N2O and to get information
on the mechanisms induced on the catalyst surface
by the presence of N2O. Another specific experiment
was performed using in situ DRIFT spectroscopy,
in order to understand the role played by N2O in the
modifications of the surface sites of the catalysts, and
XPS analysis in order to analyse any modification of
the oxidation state and/or of the atomic composition
of the surface of the catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Nickel molybdate was prepared from an aqueous so-
lution of ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·
7H2O (Aldrich, >99%), 0.0571 M and nickel nitrate
(Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) (Aldrich, >99%) 0.4 M. A 1000 ml
volume of a 0.4 M nickel nitrate solution was placed
in a 2000 ml reaction vessel. The reaction mixture
was heated to 333 K. 1000 ml of the 0.0571 M ammo-
nium heptamolybdate solution were added dropwise
to the nickel nitrate solution under vigorous stirring.
The temperature was kept constant at 333 K. The
pH was kept constant at a value of 6 by the addi-
tion of an ammonium hydroxide solution. After 4 h
of reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered and the
precipitate was dried in air at 383 K for 24 h, then it
was calcined at 773 K for 4 h under a flow of oxygen
of 50 ml/min. Two different batches were prepared,
Batch A and B.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
Catalytic tests were performed in a conventional
fixed-bed reactor system at atmospheric pressure. The
reactor was made of a Pyrex U-tube of 8 mm internal
diameter into which the catalysts was packed. The
total feed of the reactant mixture was 30 ml/min. The
amount of catalysts used in the tests was 250 mg
(diameter of the pellets
=
200315 m) in all
cases. The catalytic bed was deposited between two
10 cm high bed of small glass spheres (diameter =
0.490.72 mm). As described in the following, three
different tests were realised.
2.2.1. Test of reference
Denoted as Test TR: it has been performed in the
absence of gas dope, the concentrations of O2 (In-
dugas, 99.995%) and propane (Indugas, 99.5%) in the
feed were both 10% in volume. The balance was he-
lium (Indugas, 99.995%). Reaction temperatures were
673, 723 and 753 K.
2.2.2. Test in presence of gas dope
Denoted as Test TXN2O, in which X represents the
% of N2O introduced in the feed: the conditions of
reaction for these tests were identical to those of the
tests in the absence of dope (Test TR), but 300 ppm,
1, 5 or 10% in volume, respectively, of N2O (Indugas,
99.5%) were added to the reaction feed. In order to
maintain the same space velocity, the total gas flow
was kept constant in all the tests by balancing the flow
of He introduced as carrier gas into the reactor. A
test with 300 ppm of N2O was performed with a fresh
catalyst. Tests with 1, 5 and 10% were performed with
a fresh charge in a single experiment starting the test
with 1% of N2O, increasing the composition of N2O to
5% after 2 h and finally after another 2 h increasing the
composition of N2O to 10%. Reaction temperatures
were 673, 723 and 753 K.
2.2.3. Comparative oxidation test
These tests were always realised, with the same
amount of propane, (i) in presence of 5% of O2 (noted
as Test T 5% O2), (ii) in absence of O2 but with 10%
of N2O (namely, the same amount of oxygen atoms
corresponding to 5% of O2). This test is denoted as
Test T 0% O2 + 10% N2O. Reaction temperature was
723 K.

2.2.4. Homogeneous gas phase conversion of
propane
Blank runs with glass beads as diluents (without
catalyst) were carried out at three different tempera-
tures (673, 723 and 753 K) under exactly the same ex-
perimental conditions. No conversion of propane was
observed, indicating the absence of homogeneous re-
action for propene production under the experimen-
tal conditions used. The homogeneous conversion of
propane starts at higher temperature (>800 K).
2.2.4.1. Analysis of reactants and products.
It was
performed by gas chromatography during the whole
duration of the catalytic tests. The reactor outlet was
analysed in two columns using helium as carrier
gas, namely, a Hayesep Q column 6 in. × 1/8 cm
(100120 m) and a molecular sieve 6 in. × 1/8 cm
(0.5 nm). The Hayesep column was used for the
quantification of propane, propylene and CO2. No
CO formation was observed. Water was detected on
the Hayesep column but was not quantified. Analyses
were performed every 20 min during about 2 h. Activ-
ity was stable during all the duration of analysis. No
indication of deactivation as a function of time was
observed. In spite that the variations in the conversion
and yields are not so high, the results were reproduced
several times under identical experimental conditions
using catalysts from the same batch.
The measured performances were accurate within a
range of about 1% (in relative) for the conversions of
propane and oxygen and within a range of about 4%
(in relative) for the yields in propylene and N2O. The
range of accuracy on the selectivity was thus about
10% (in relative). Reproducibility of an identical ex-
periment using catalysts from different batches was
not systematically checked at the quantitative level,
however it was ascertained at the qualitative level.
Therefore, the quantitative comparisons of perfor-
mances reported hereafter only concern experiments
carried out with catalysts coming from identical
batches.
2.2.4.2. Characterisation
techniques.
Catalysts
were characterised before and after the tests by spe-
cific area measurements (SBET), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), ammonia temperature programmed desorp-
tion (NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and confocal laser Raman microscopy (Raman).
Particular experiments were performed with diffuse
reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
(DRIFTS).
BET surface area, were measured using a Mi-
cromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument by adsorption of
nitrogen (Indugas, 99.995%) at 77 K on 200 mg of
samples previously degassed at 453 K for 2 h under a
controlled flow of 30% N2, 70% He.
XRD was performed on a Siemens D5000 diffrac-
tometer using the K radiation of Cu (λ = 1.5418 Å).
The 2θ range between 5 and 80was scanned at a rate
of 0.2min1. Identification of the phases was carried
out by using JCPDS database [18].
Raman measurements were performed with a
Labram spectrometer (Dilor) interfaced with an
Olympus optical microscope. The excitation radiation
was a HeNe laser (632.8 nm) operated at a power
of 10 mW. The 100× objective of the microscope
was used so that a spot of about 1 m2 at the surface
of the sample was measured at once. Spectra were
obtained by averaging three scans of the Raman shift
range between 1100 and 100 cm1 recorded in 10 s
with a spectral resolution of 7 cm1. The identity
of the spectra obtained at different positions of each
sample was systematically verified.
XPS was performed with a SSI X-probe (SSX-100/
206) spectrometer from Surface Science Instrument
(Fisons) working with a monochromatic Al K ra-
diation (10 kV, 22 mA). Charge neutralisation was
achieved by using an electron flood gun adjusted at
8 eV and placing a nickel grid 3.0 mm above the sam-
ple. Pass energy for the analyser was 50 eV and the
spot size was 1000 m in diameter, corresponding to
a FWHM (full width at half maximum) of 1.1 eV for
the Au 3d5/2 band of a gold standard. For these mea-
surements, Ni 2p, Mo 3d, O 1s and C 1s bands were
recorded. The binding energies were calibrated by
fixing the C(C, H) contribution of the C 1s adventi-
tious carbon at 284.8 eV. Peaks were considered to be
combinations of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions
in a 85:15 ratio working with a Shirley baseline. For
the quantification of the elements, Wagner sensibility
factors were used. Decomposition of the Mo 3d dou-
blets to Mon+ species was done by fixing an energy
gap of 3.15 eV, and an area ratio of 2:3 between the
Mo 3d3/2 and the Mo 3d5/2 bands. Solutions of the
decomposition were afterwards validated by check-
ing that the binding energies for the different Mon+

235
eventually found fitted with those commonly accepted
and that an energy gap of about 1.2 eV existed between
corresponding bands of two successive Mon+ species.
DRIFTS spectra were obtained by using a con-
trolled temperature and environment reflectance cell
(Spectra-Tech 0030-102) with ZnSe windows and
coupled to a Brucker EQUINOX55 infrared spec-
trometer equipped with an air cooled MIR source
with KBr optics and a MCT detector. The sample
was placed inside the chamber without packing or
dilution. A flow of 36.4 ml/min of He was introduced
in the DRIFTS cell during 1 h and the spectra of
the original sample collected. Then the sample was
heated in situ to 728 K under helium, maintained
1 h at such a temperature and then 1% of N2O, 10%
of N2O and then synthetic air (20% O2 and 80%
N2) was adsorbed successively. All the experiments
were carried out at 36.4 ml/min of total flow of reac-
tants. Spectra were obtained by co-adding 200 scans
at 4 cm1 of resolution, and they are presented in
absorbance mode without any manipulation.
NH3-TPD was performed to determine the num-
ber and the strength of the acid sites. The samples
were first degassed for 1 h at 743 K under helium.
Thereafter, NH3 (anhydrous, Indugas) was adsorbed
on the samples at 423 K as 10 pulses of 380 l. The
desorption profile was recorded by GCMS while
heating the sample at a rate of 10 K/min up to 743 K
and then stabilising it at this temperature for 30 min.
The quantity of NH3 adsorbed and that desorbed were

3. Results
3.1. Catalytic activity measurement
3.1.1. Test in presence and absence of N2O (Tests
TR and TXN2O)
Results at the three studied temperatures show the
same tendency. Table 1 presents the results obtained
with batch A in absence of N2O and in presence of
300 ppm of N2O after 1 h of reaction at 723 K. A small
peak, probably corresponding to a little amount of an-
other product (not identified with success, but which
is not CO) was observed in all cases in the chro-
matogram. Comparing both tests we can observe that
the addition of 300 ppm of N2O in the feed induces
a modification in the catalytic performances: (i) a de-
crease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) an
increase in the yield in propylene (+11%), (iii) an in-
crease in the selectivity of propylene (+32%), (iv) a
decrease in the conversion of oxygen (19%), (v) a
decrease in the yield (21%) and a weak decrease in
the selectivity in CO2 (8%). Table 2 presents the re-
sults of another test obtained with batch B: when the
amount of N2O is increased from 1 to 10% in vol-
ume. Comparing with the Test TR, it is observed that
the addition of 1% of N2O in the feed leads to the
236
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
following results: (i) the conversion of propane re-
mains nearly unchanged (+5%), (ii) a decrease in the
yield in propylene (32%), (iii) a decrease in the se-
lectivity of propylene (36%), (iv) a decrease in the
yield (26%) and in the selectivity in CO2 (30%), (vi)
the conversion of oxygen remains unchanged (2%).
When the amount of N2O increases to 5 and 10% of
N2O and comparing with the results obtained with 1%
of N2O, the following results are observed: (i) the con-
version of propane remains unchanged, (ii) the yield
and the selectivity in propylene increase in all cases,
(iii) the conversion in oxygen decreases significantly
and (iv) the yield and the selectivity in CO2 also de-
crease significantly. Comparing the results obtained
with 10% with those obtained in the TR test, it is ob-
served that: (i) the conversion is unchanged (<1%),
(ii) the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease
(16 and 29% respectively), (iii) the conversion in
oxygen decreases (29%) and the yield and the selec-
tivity in CO2 decrease (35 and 35%, respectively).
Comparing results presented in Tables 1 and 2, a
clear trend is observed. Taking into account the preci-
sion in the measurement, the introduction of N2O in
the feed produces a change in the yield and the se-
lectivity in propylene, in the consumption of oxygen
and in the yield and selectivity in CO2, which effects
depend on the composition of N2O in the feed.
The sum of selectivity of propylene and CO2 is less
than 50% for catalysts from batch A and about 80%
for catalysts from batch B. The values of selectivity
in propylene are in the average of values observed
in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane on oxide catalysts with this degree of con-
version and have been considered acceptable for the
present study. On the other hand, the oxygen balance
considering the formation of these two products is less
than 50 and 30% for catalysts from batches A and B,
respectively. Both results suggest that some propane
is probably converted to an oxygenated product. The
fact that in presence of a high amount of N2O, both
the selectivities in propylene and in CO2 decrease,
supports the formation of such oxygenated products.
The decrease in CO2 formation, the biggest consumer
of oxygen, confirms this fact. One possibility is the
formation of CO. We have not observed CO formation
during analysis. This is logical, because under our
experimental conditions we have verified experimen-
tally that CO is easily oxidised to CO2 on NiMoO4
catalysts. Acrolein is the most probable oxygenated
product formed. Effectively in the chromatogram the
small peak corresponds exactly to the expected po-
sition for it. However, the area of the peak was not
reproducible enough and very difficult to quantify.
We recall that our experiments have been performed
under low conversion of propane, making the analysis
of products more difficult. Other alternatives are that
an alcohol, an acid, an aldehyde, etc. is formed. As
the principal aim of our investigation was to study
the changes in the catalytic performances due to the
introduction of N2O during the catalytic reaction, we
have not insisted further in their identification nor in
the effect of N2O on their formation nor in the mod-
ification of the synthesis of the catalysts preparation
to get some correlation with such a product.
A difference in the catalytic activity was observed
for Test TR with batches A or B. At present we have
not investigated the reasons of this difference. This
could be attributed to some local differences between
the catalysts of the two used batches, occurring prob-
ably during the preparation or calcinations steps, not
detected by the techniques used to characterise the
catalysts. Some divergences in the preparation of
catalysts, although following an identical protocol
of preparation, is usual with oxide catalysts. In fact
minor differences in the control of pH, temperatures,
rate of addition of reactants, etc, could explain such
divergences in the case of NiMoO4 preparation cat-
alysts. Obviously the reasons of these differences
could be further explored but, presently, such a study
is outside of the principal scope of our work. As for
both catalysts the effects due to the addition of N2O
in the feed are clearly demonstrated, we have not
insisted in further investigating the reasons of such a
difference. Actually, what it is important to underline
in the present work, is that by the only fact of adding
N2O, changes in the catalytic performances occurred
in both catalysts obtained from batches A and B.
In the following, we will focus in these changes as
indicated in Tables 1 and 2.
3.1.2. Comparative oxidation test
The results of Test 5% O2 and Test 0% O2 + 10%
N2O are presented in Table 3. Comparing both tests it
is observed that the reaction in presence of N2O shows
a lower conversion of propane (15%) but a higher
yield (+15%) and selectivity (+39%) in propylene. A

weak change in the yield and in the selectivity in CO2
was observed (10 and +9%, respectively). Clearly,
in presence of pure N2O, propylene is produced from
propane.
3.1.3. Characterisation
The fresh nickel molybdate sample has a specific
area value of 58 m2/g. After the catalytic reactions
with 10% of oxygen in the feed (Tests TR, T0.3N2O
and TXN2O), the specific area of nickel molybdate
drops very similarly for all the tests realised to about
38 m2/g.
Fresh nickel molybdate samples, from batches A
and B, show the peaks characteristic of -NiMoO4.
Fig. 1. Confocal Raman spectra of (A) fresh nickel molybdate catalyst and (B) of the catalyst recovered after a test in the presence of
300 ppm of N2O.
The spectrum corresponds to the file 31-0902 of
JCPDS except two peaks at 2θ = 26.649 and 27.307
corresponding to -NiMoO4 (file JCPDS no. 45-0142)
[1214] as discussed elsewhere [3]. After catalytic
test, independently of the fact that the reaction is
performed in presence or in absence of N2O, XRD
patterns spectra are similar to the fresh catalyst. This
is also observed when the catalytic test is performed
without molecular oxygen in presence of only 10%
N2O. The peaks corresponding to -NiMoO4 disap-
pear after the catalytic tests.
Fig. 1 (trace A) shows a typical Raman spectrum
found for the fresh catalyst. The Raman spectrum for
the fresh NiMoO4 corresponds to a collection of peaks
238
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
indicating the simultaneous presence of -NiMoO4
phases,  (peaks at 363 and 908 cm1) or  (peaks at
258, 386, 705, 908 and 956 cm1), and of -NiMoO4
(peaks at 340, 818 and the shoulder at 887 cm1).
The shoulder appearing for Raman shifts between 930
and 940 cm1 is a combination of peaks generated by
 and -NiMoO4. Additional peaks appearing below
400 cm1 have not been attributed since no unambigu-
ous references in the literature are available. No other
peaks were detected. In particular, no peak that could
indicate the presence of MoO3 (precisely no peaks
of MoO3 that appear at Raman shifts not overlapping
with peaks of Ni molybdates, e.g. at 995 cm1) was
detected. The spectrum obtained for the catalysts af-
ter reaction in presence of N2O is shown in Fig. 1
(trace B). This spectrum is identical to those obtained
with the catalysts tested in the absence of N2O. The
peaks generated by the  phases are still there with-
out any significant loss of intensity compared with the
spectrum of the fresh catalyst. However, all the peaks
exclusively generated by -NiMoO4 (340, 818 and
887 cm1) either completely disappeared or suffered
dramatic loss of intensity for the catalysts recovered
after tests, independently of the presence or absence
of N2O in the feed.
Table 4 shows the main results obtained by XPS.
The binding energies correspond to carbon, oxygen,
molybdenum and nickel. They are identical for the
fresh NiMoO4 and the samples recovered after the dif-
ferent catalytic tests. A difference is observed studying
the surface concentrations. The principal observations
that can be made are: (i) the Ni/Mo XPS atomic ra-
tio for the fresh catalyst is higher than the theoretical
atomic ratio (1:1): Ni enriches the surface. This XPS

atomic ratio remains unchanged after Test TR and de-
creases after Test TXN2O, (ii) A reduction of the cat-
alysts is observed in presence of N2O. The quantity of
Mo6+ decreases and that of Mo5+ increases when the
concentration of N2O in the gas feed is higher After
test with 300 ppm of N2O, Mo5+ is observed (2.3% of
the total Mo). After test in presence of 1, 5 and 10%
of N2O, the amount in Mo6+ decreases (by 34.1%)
and Mo5+ is observed (4.8% of the total Mo) (iii) af-
ter Test TR and test with 300 ppm of N2O, the C/Mo
XPS and the O/Mo XPS atomic ratios remain nearly
unchanged. On the contrary, after Test TXN2O (1, 5
and 10% of N2O) the C/Mo and the O/Mo XPS atomic
ratios and the amount of carbon drastically increase.
The reduction of molybdenum atoms seems induced
by the presence of N2O during the catalytic test, even
if the concentration is low. The magnitude of the re-
duction of molybdenum is proportional to the amount
of N2O.
Fig. 2 shows the DRIFTS spectra of the nickel
molybdate sample obtained at room temperature at
728 K under helium. For a better observation of the
changes induced in the spectra by the heating treat-
ment, the difference spectra is also included. In the
1100500 cm1 region, at room temperature, the spec-
trum of nickel molybdate presents bands at 1000, 976,
940, 885, 823, 810 and 760 cm1. In spite of the dif-
ficulty in the assignment of the vibration bands of
the molybdenum oxide and molybdates [1619] be-
cause of the influence of the longitudinaltransverse
splitting effects in IR bands, these bands can be as-
cribed to MoO3 (1000, 976, 885, 823 and 810 cm1)
and molybdenum hydrate (760 and 955 cm1). In fact,
they match with the ones described previously [18] for

mechanically activated MoO3. No bands that could be
ascribed to molybdates or nickel compounds are de-
tected, suggesting that the nickel phase is covered by
MoO3. In the OH stretching region, the room tem-
perature spectrum is dominated by a broad absorption
centred at about 3400 cm1 assigned to OH groups
and adsorbed water molecules bonded by H bonds.
Heating the sample at 728 K induces a decrease
in intensity and a shift to lower wavenumbers of the
MoO3 vibration bands (for instance, the fundamental
ν(Mo=O) shifts from 1000 to 997 cm1), the disap-
pearance of the bands due to molybdenum hydrate and
the clarification of the OH structure of the solid. All
these facts are related with the water desorption and
thermal dehydration of the solid. On the other hand,
the large number of different hydroxyls groups (up
to 7) compared to that described in the literature for
MoO3 and NiMoO4 agrees with the higher specific
surface area of our nickel molybdate sample (58 m2/g
faced to 30 m2/g) [15,17] and suggests the existence
of a great variety of co-ordination environments for
such groups.
The difference in situ DRIFTS spectra obtained
during the N2O adsorption experiment are shown in
Fig. 3. The introduction of 1% N2O in the DRIFTS cell
240
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
(Fig. 3, trace A) induces an increase in the intensity of
the bands of the molybdenum-oxygen vibrations in the
1100500 cm1 region. Simultaneously, a decrease in
the intensity of the bands due to stretching and bend-
ing modes of hydroxyls groups and those of combi-
nation are produced. However, no bands assigned to
adsorbed N2O species are detected, and only gaseous
N2O bands are visible [19]. A similar behaviour is
observed when increasing the concentration of N2O
in the gas phase to 10% (Fig. 3, trace B). From here,
it is clear that gaseous N2O is able to interact with
the surface OH groups of nickel molybdate, inducing
changes in the metaloxygen structure.
When N2O is removed from the gas phase, these
changes in the DRIFTS spectra reverse pointing out
the reversible character of the changes induced by
the N2O adsorption. However, it is important to note
that this is not a completely reversible process, since
the band intensities of the initial spectra are not fully
recovered. The introduction of synthetic air in the
DRIFTS chamber has a similar effect on the spectra
to the one described for N2O in Fig. 3. Only differ-
ences in the intensity of the bands are observed. In
Fig. 4, the differences in DRIFTS spectra of the nickel
molybdate under synthetic air, 10% N2O, 1% N2O

and helium flow against the initial spectrum under
helium at 828 K, are reproduced. Three observations
and/or conclusions must be extracted from this figure:
(1) N2O and air exert a similar effect on the DRIFTS
spectra, increasing the intensity of the MoO vibra-
tions bands; (2) such an effect is not fully reversible,
as can be deduced from the remaining positive inten-
sity of the MoO bands after removing N2O of the
chamber (trace D) and (3) the intensity of the bands
due to MoO vibrations of the solid increases in the
sequence:
Helium < 1% N2O < 10 %N2O < synthetic air.
From these results it could be concluded that, N2O pro-
motes less amounts of metaloxygen structure, namely
that N2O stabilises a more reduced oxidation state
of molybdenum on nickel molybdate than molecular
oxygen.
Results from TPD-NH3
on nickel molybdate
showed that desorption profiles (Fig. 5) are essentially
similar for fresh and used samples, in presence or
absence of N2O. For all samples the desorption starts
around 483 K, then suddenly accelerates to reach an
identical maximum between 543 and 563 K, before
slowly vanishing linearly until about 783 K. A weak

difference is observed from 680 to 775 K. This varia-
tion in the curve is not due to a larger amount of am-
monia desorbed since the quantity of ammonia trapped
by the boric acid during the desorption is similar for
the fresh and used TR, T0.3N2O and TXN2O catalysts
(2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 mol NH3/m2, respectively).
4. Discussion
Clearly the fact of adding some amounts of N2O in
the feed produces important changes in the catalytic
performances. Data from the characterisation of the
catalysts exclude the possibility that the observed ef-
fects due to the presence of N2O could be explained
by: (i) a change in the surface area, as in presence and
in absence of N2O the changes in the BET surface
area are exactly the same, (ii) the formation of a new
compound: in spite that the -NiMoO4 phase almost
completely disappears during the catalytic test, the
evolution of the phases observed by XRD are the same,
independently of the presence or absence of N2O. We
notice that in any case the formation of a carbonate,
nitrate phase or other mixed oxide was never observed,
(iii) a change in the acidity: it could be expected that
the presence of N2O, either by its dissociation or by its
adsorption, could modify the number or the nature of
the acid sites on the surface of nickel molybdate cata-
lyst. The results on TPD of ammonia are very conclu-
sive: the TPD profiles and the acidity values obtained
by NH3 desorption are identical in all cases. Clearly,
under the sensibility of the TPD technique, the acid-
ity of the catalysts is not modified by the presence
of N2O.
In the following, an attempt of an explanation of the
role played by N2O in the ODP experiments is given.
5. The architecture of the nickel molybdate
catalysts
The fresh nickel molybdate sample has a XRD
pattern possessing all the peaks characteristic of
-NiMoO4. Only two peaks can be attributed to the
presence of -NiMoO4. The presence of -NiMoO4 is
additionally suggested by data from XPS (the excess
of superficial Ni with respect to the stoichiometry) and
Raman spectroscopy. On the other hand, the DRIFT
experiments showed, unequivocally, the presence of
pure MoO3 only. No bands attributed to molybdates or
242
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
other Ni compounds were observed by this technique.
The difference in the species (MoO3 or Ni molyb-
dates) discovered at the surface of the fresh sample by
DRIFT and Raman can be explained by the difference
of surface sensitivity of the two techniques, DRIFT
often being considered as more surface sensitive than
confocal Raman spectroscopy. Thus, the most plau-
sible architecture to be proposed for the fresh nickel
molybdate sample consists in a mixture of -NiMoO4
phase, as the main component, of -NiMoO4 phase
as a minor component, both supporting on their sur-
face, small amounts of MoO3 crystallites. In presence
or absence of N2O, the -NiMoO4 phase completely
disappears after the catalytic tests. This behaviour is
supported by the disappearance of both the XRD and
Raman peaks typical of the  phase. It thus turns
out without ambiguity that -NiMoO4 is not stable
during the catalytic tests, regardless of the presence
or absence of N2O. The stability of this phase as a
function of the temperature of reaction and the condi-
tions of reaction was discussed in detail in a previous
work [3]. At present what is important to underline
is that, independently of the presence or absence of
N2O, the evolution of the catalyst is exactly the same.
The XRD patterns of the nickel molybdate catalyst
after the Test TR, and in presence of N2O (300 ppm,
1, 5 and 10%) are identical.
6. Modification of the surface atomic
concentration during the catalytic reaction
The possibility of a modification in the surface com-
position of the catalyst due to a metal migration during
the reaction was studied by XPS and seems to be ex-
cluded. The decrease in the Ni/Mo XPS atomic ratio
could be explained by the increase in the carbon con-
tent due to a carbonaceous product. In presence of a
high amount of N2O, the carbon content increases by
about 50% after reaction (Table 4). A carbonaceous
product seems to be formed on Mo and preferentially
on Ni atoms, decreasing the molybdenum and Ni con-
centration on the surface as is clearly indicated by XPS
analysis. The increases of C/Mo and O/Mo and the
decrease of Ni/Mo XPS atomic ratios are consistent
with this picture. What is important to underline here
is that it should not be necessary to call to some metal
atom migration occurring on the surface due to the
presence of N2O to explain the observed results. On
the other hand, it would be very speculative to admit
that such migration could occur by the only presence
of N2O in the feed.
7. Dynamic processes involved under reaction
conditions
7.1. The reducing role of N2O
Taking into account the above discussion, the more
likely explanation of the observed results is that the
N2O introduced in the feed is able to modify the
chemical state of the active sites on NiMoO4 by
some dynamic processes induced under the reaction
conditions.
XPS gives the argument for a plausible explana-
tion. In the presence of N2O, molybdenum works in a
more reduced state (Table 4). Mo5+ is observed only
in the presence of N2O. The presence of 300 ppm of
N2O in the feed, already promotes the reduction of
molybdenum. In fact, under these conditions, about
2% of the molybdenum in surface is present as Mo5+
after catalytic reaction. On the contrary, in absence of
N2O, no reduced molybdenum was observed. DRIFT
experiments support this result. The high amount of
hydroxyls groups present in fresh samples, decreases
due to the loss of the dehydration water when the
sample is heated. Simultaneously during heating, the
amount of Mo=O bonds grows (Fig. 2). When N2O
is added, hydroxyls decrease further and the bonds
corresponding to M=O increase further. This effect
is more marked when the amount of N2O introduced
is higher (Figs. 34). This indicates, unequivocally,
that N2O interacts with nickel molybdate catalysts
and that such an interaction modifies the nature of the
sites on the surface of the catalysts (decreasing the
OH and HOH groups and promoting the formation of
M=O bonds). When O2 is introduced, after evacuation
of N2O, the amount of M=O bonds formed increases
further (Fig. 5). This indicates that the number of
M=O bonds in presence of molecular oxygen is higher
compared with those observed in presence of N2O. In
other words, the surface of the catalysts is in a higher
oxidation state in presence of O2. Contrary, when
N2O is added, the oxidation of the surface is limited,
it is less oxidised. These results suggest that, during
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
243
the reaction in presence of N2O, the catalyst is not
able to get the full oxidation state like in the absence
of N2O (Test TR). The conclusion is that N2O inhibits
the oxidation of the catalyst promoting its reduction.
At this stage, a plausible hypothesis could be that
the mechanism by which N2O limits the oxidation rate
of the catalysts is realised by inhibiting the adsorp-
tion of O2 on the surface of the catalysts. N2O could
be adsorbed in the same vacancies where O2 usually
is. The inhibition in the adsorption of O2 can have, at
least, two consequences: (i) to limit the amount of O2
species produced by the dissociation of O2, decreasing
the oxidation rate of the catalysts. It is well known that
the reduced catalyst after the formation of the propy-
lene are oxidised by this nucleophilic species, (ii) to
limit (or inhibit) the formation of more electrophilic
oxygen species (as O, O2), formed also from the
dissociation of molecular oxygen. It is well known
that these species could promote the non selective at-
tack of the hydrocarbons. Then, the inhibition in the
formation of such species also lead to an increase in
the selectivity.
7.2. Role of N2O on the selectivity
In presence of a small amount of N2O, the catalyst
is more selective than in its absence. This is clearly
established when comparing the results obtained in
Test T0.3N2O with those obtained in Test TR. Adding
300 ppm of N2O, the conversion of propane and of
oxygen decrease (15 and 19%, respectively), the
yield in propylene is a little higher (+11%) and the se-
lectivity in propylene increases significantly (+32%).
In addition, the yield and the selectivity in CO2 de-
crease (20.5 and 8%, respectively). This result
could be well explained admitting that some non se-
lective sites have been inhibited by the addition of
N2O. Simultaneously, molybdenum has been reduced
during reaction.
The above results indicate that, when molybdenum
is reduced, the selectivity is improved, and that the
modulation of the oxidation state of molybdenum
could be realised adding N2O during the catalytic re-
action. Catalysts containing less oxidised sites work
more selectively than fully oxidised catalysts. The
role that the reduced sites play in the selectivity of
catalysts in oxidation reactions and the control of
this reduced sites during the catalytic reaction by the
operational conditions has been discussed extensively
previously [4]. The present result strongly supports
these observations and underlines the role that the
dynamics of these processes plays in the modulation
of selectivity of the catalysts.
Interesting is the fact that, the amount of carbona-
ceous products formed on the surface of the catalysts
using 300 ppm is about the same as that observed in
absence of N2O. This indicates that the presence of
small amount of N2O does not promote the formation
of sites where these carbonaceous products could be
formed. As it will be seen later, this is not the case
when the amount of N2O is higher.
7.3. Reversibility of the sites created by N2O
Another important aspect that deserves attention is
the fact that the catalytic performances observed in
presence of N2O remains when the amount of N2O is
stopped. The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but
the reversibility is not instantaneous after the change of
N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been clearly observed
in DRIFT experiments. The bands associated to Mo=O
remain (many hours) after the N2O has been removed.
This indicates that the nature of the selective sites
created by N2O is not modified spontaneously when
the N2O is not present anymore in the feed. Namely,
in spite of the absence of N2O, the sites remain in
their oxidation state following the classical cycle of
oxidationreduction. However, some time (probably
hours) is needed to equilibrate the catalysts under the
new reaction conditions. This result explains why it is
necessary to keep some amounts of N2O in the feed to
maintain the selective sites created by the introduction
of N2O.
7.4. Influence of the amount of N2O in the feed
When the amount of N2O increases to 1%, a de-
crease in the yield and in the selectivity in propylene, a
lower O2 consumption and a significantly lower yield
and selectivity in CO2 is observed. After the test in
presence of high amount of N2O, catalysts show a sig-
nificant formation of carbonaceous products (increase
by about 40%). XPS shows that under these condi-
tions, the Mo5+ concentration is higher. This indicates
that a higher amount of N2O promotes the formation
of sites (reduced sites) where carbonaceous products
244
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
could be formed. This is a new and important result
because it is normally accepted that N2O is a good
oxidant for hydrocarbons. On the contrary, our exper-
iments show that N2O is a powerful reducing agent
of the catalyst. This is supported by previous experi-
ments studying the treatment of molybdenum subox-
ide with only N2O (without O2), as is reported in de-
tail elsewhere [20]. A Mo suboxide sample (mixture of
Mo8O23, as the main constituent, with a small amount
of Mo9O26 and traces of Mo4O11) was prepared by
the solid-state reaction under reduced pressure of an
intimate mixture of MoO3 and MoO2 at 1023 K for
96 h. The oxidation state of molybdenum was care-
fully studied by XPS. Surprisingly, at 673 K, under a
flow containing 5% of N2O, a further reduction of the
suboxide was observed. The amount of reduced Mo
species detected by XPS at the surface of the sample
increased by about 50% after such a treatment. This is
a new and unexpected result. To account for this deep
reduction effects brought about by high concentrations
of N2O, one can evoke the inhibition effect mentioned
for the slight reduction of the catalysts as detected
when a low concentration of N2O was concerned. This
hypothesis remains valid here. However, the experi-
ment with the Mo suboxide suggests that a direct re-
duction of the catalyst is induced by the action of N2O
at its surface. The detailed mechanism of such a direct
reduction is discussed elsewhere [20] but can be sum-
marised by the following reaction: N2O + Ocatalysts =
N2 + O2 + Ocatalyst (where Ocatalyst represents an oxy-
gen vacancy at the surface of the catalyst).
Deeply reduced sites lead to formation of more car-
bonaceous products explaining the above results. It is
clear that N2O promotes the reduction of the sites, but
certainly there is an optimum in the amount of N2O
which is beneficial. If the reduction is not very high
(300 ppm), selectivity is promoted, but if reduction is
too high (corresponding to high concentrations of N2O
of 1, 5 and 10%), the carbonaceous product formation
is favoured and selectivity drops.
Moreover, the fact that the conversion of propane,
the yield and the selectivity in propylene increase
when the amount of N2O increases further, suggest
that under high concentrations of N2O, another phe-
nomenon is involved: N2O could be able to induce the
catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with
some selectivity. This interpretation is confirmed by
the results obtained in presence of N2O (without O2)
on fully oxidised (fresh) catalysts. Comparing Tests T
5% O2 and T 0% O2 + 10% N2O (namely, both tests
containing the same oxygen in the feed), it is con-
cluded that in presence of pure N2O, the catalyst is
able to oxidise the propane in propylene with a higher
selectivity (for similar conversion, selectivity of 28.7%
compared with 20.6%, respectively). The formation
of CO2 is also lower (yields of 2.1% compared to
1.9%). This is also a new result. There is no reference
in the literature showing that N2O could perform the
ODH of propane on nickel molybdate (and apparently
on other) oxide catalysts. When the amount of N2O
is higher (10%), the yield in propylene is very simi-
lar to those observed without N2O and the yield and
selectivity in CO2 (4.4 and 34.7%) are significantly
lower. This indicates that when the amount of N2O
in the feed is high, N2O could induce the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (Table 2)
and this could be made with an acceptable selectivity.
However, the situation is more complex. Under a high
N2O concentration, the catalyst is deeply reduced
and a big amount of carbonaceous products is simul-
taneously formed. On the other hand, too reduced
catalysts are less active for propane transformation.
These observations show that, the good performance
observed in the formation of propylene from propane
with pure N2O is probably not stable on time and that
the catalysts would be further deactivated with time
on stream.
7.5. Correlation with CO2 as dope
The presents results can be put in correlation with
the results presented in previous papers [3,21,22]. In
these papers it was concluded that the principal role of
CO2 is to dissociate itself so providing monoatomic
oxygen species and thus increasing the oxidation
state of Mo sites at the surface of catalysts identical
to those used in this work. This indicates that CO2
and N2O succeed to modify the chemical state of the
active sites of nickel molybdate under the conditions
of reaction. However, their role seems to produce a
contradictory effect: CO2 oxidises and N2O reduces
the catalytic sites.
At this state we could make some speculations
which could be useful for further applications of the
concepts expressed in these works. It is clear that
when adjusting the amounts of CO2 and N2O, the
F. Dury et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 247 (2003) 231246
245
optimal oxidation state of the atoms in surface could
be modulated in order to improve performances. The
optimal oxidation state will depend on the hydrocar-
bon to be oxidised and on the experimental reaction
conditions. Our results give the tool to adjust such an
oxidation state in order to improve selectivity and the
arguments to explain the mechanisms of the involved
processes.
The most common case comes from processes using
very active and non selective catalysts. Modulating the
amount of N2O, it should be possible to inhibit the
origin of the non selectivity (limiting adsorption of
oxygen, the formation of active oxygen species, etc.).
The present work gives detailed arguments to ex-
plain the beneficial role of the addition of N2O as
dope in the feed. It could be argued that the effects
arisen by the addition of N2O are not extremely high
and could make the relevance of the observed effects
relative. However, experiments performing ODP with
other catalysts (mixtures of NiMoO4 and -Sb2O4,
CeO2, mixture of NiMoO4 and CeO2 (4, 22)) show
the same tendencies as discussed above or even more
marked, confirming the present results. Obviously, fur-
ther works have to be realised for a comprehensive
understanding of the mechanisms by which dopes act
during the reaction. We hope, with this work, to con-

8. Conclusions
The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane
and molecular oxygen could have important implica-
tions in the catalytic performances of the oxidative
dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel
molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the
oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduc-
tion. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O
in the feed. Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher
is the degree of reduction of catalysts. The mecha-
nism of such a reduction switches from an inhibition
of the oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations
to a combination of this inhibition effect with a di-
rect reduction of the surface of the catalyst by N2O
at high concentrations. Some ppm of N2O only lead
to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about
a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of
the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of
the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption.
When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of
the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion
of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene
decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity
to CO2 decrease further. At high concentration of N2O
propylene is produced from propane. But this proba-
bly happens only under transitory conditions as N2O
needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce
propylene.

<questions>


Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
