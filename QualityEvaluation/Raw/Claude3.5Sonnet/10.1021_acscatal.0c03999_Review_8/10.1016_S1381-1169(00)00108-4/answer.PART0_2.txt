[1] "It is known that the interaction of N2O with ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely active surface oxygen species discovered by Ref. [1] which was called a-oxygen [2]."

[2] "The a-oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethylene with 96-98% selectivity; it reacts with methane at ambient temperatures to give methanol or converts benzene to phenol at moderate temperatures."

[3] "Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85-95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about N2O as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, based on the available information:

N2O shows high selectivity for propylene formation from propane, with 85-95% selectivity at conversions up to 10%. This high selectivity is comparable to its performance with other hydrocarbons like ethane to ethylene (96-98% selectivity) and benzene to phenol.

The study uses HZSM-5 zeolite as a catalyst for the N2O-based oxidation reactions. The interaction of N2O with ZSM-5 produces a highly active surface oxygen species called α-oxygen.

A critical challenge mentioned is rapid catalyst deactivation, which leads to decreased activity over time while selectivity remains constant.

To address the limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, potential research directions could include:

1. Developing more stable catalysts that resist deactivation.
2. Investigating the mechanisms of catalyst deactivation to find ways to mitigate it.
3. Exploring modifications to the HZSM-5 catalyst or entirely new catalyst formulations to improve activity and stability.
4. Studying the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to optimize the balance between selectivity, conversion, and catalyst stability.

However, it's important to note that the literature provided does not offer detailed information on these aspects, and further research would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)氧化剂的问题。但是，根据可用信息：

N2O显示出对丙烯形成的高选择性，在转化率达10%时，丙烷到丙烯的选择性为85-95%。这种高选择性与其在其他碳氢化合物如乙烷到乙烯(96-98%选择性)和苯到苯酚的反应中的表现相当。

该研究使用HZSM-5沸石作为N2O基氧化反应的催化剂。N2O与ZSM-5的相互作用产生了一种被称为α-氧的高活性表面氧物种。

提到的一个关键挑战是催化剂的快速失活，这导致活性随时间降低，而选择性保持不变。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，潜在的研究方向可能包括：

1. 开发更稳定的催化剂，抵抗失活。
2. 研究催化剂失活的机制，以找到缓解方法。
3. 探索HZSM-5催化剂的改进或全新的催化剂配方，以提高活性和稳定性。
4. 研究反应条件(温度、压力、进料组成)，以优化选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性之间的平衡。

然而，重要的是要注意，所提供的文献并未对这些方面提供详细信息，需要进一步的研究才能全面回答这个问题。
