[1] "It is known that the interaction of N2O with ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely active surface oxygen species discovered by Ref. [1] which was called α-oxygen [2]."

[2] "The α-oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethylene with 96–98% selectivity; it reacts with methane at ambient temperatures to give methanol or converts benzene to phenol at moderate temperatures."

[3] "Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85–95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst."

The literature provides limited information specifically about nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it does mention some relevant points about N2O's use with ZSM-5 catalysts for hydrocarbon conversion:

1. N2O interacts with ZSM-5 zeolites to produce a highly active surface oxygen species called α-oxygen.

2. This α-oxygen shows high selectivity (85-95%) for propylene formation from propane, as well as for ethylene from ethane and phenol from benzene.

3. The selectivity remains constant over time, but catalyst activity decreases rapidly due to deactivation.

The main challenge identified is catalyst deactivation, which leads to a rapid decrease in activity. To address this limitation and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, research could focus on:

1. Developing more stable catalysts that resist deactivation.
2. Understanding the mechanism of catalyst deactivation to devise strategies for preventing or mitigating it.
3. Exploring catalyst regeneration techniques to extend catalyst lifetime.
4. Investigating the use of promoters or modifiers to enhance catalyst stability.
5. Optimizing reaction conditions to balance high selectivity with improved catalyst longevity.

While the document doesn't provide comprehensive information on N2O-ODHP, it suggests that the high selectivity achieved with N2O as an oxidant makes it a promising avenue for further research and development in propylene production.

该文献对于一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的应用提供了有限的信息。然而，它确实提到了一些关于N2O与ZSM-5催化剂用于碳氢化合物转化的相关点：

1. N2O与ZSM-5沸石相互作用，产生一种被称为α-氧的高活性表面氧物种。

2. 这种α-氧在丙烷生成丙烯、乙烷生成乙烯以及苯生成苯酚的过程中表现出高选择性（85-95%）。

3. 选择性随时间保持恒定，但由于催化剂失活，活性迅速下降。

文献中确定的主要挑战是催化剂失活，导致活性迅速下降。为了解决这一限制并使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究可以集中在以下方面：

1. 开发更稳定的、能够抵抗失活的催化剂。
2. 了解催化剂失活机理，以制定防止或减轻失活的策略。
3. 探索催化剂再生技术，以延长催化剂寿命。
4. 研究使用助剂或改性剂来提高催化剂稳定性。
5. 优化反应条件，以平衡高选择性和改善的催化剂寿命。

虽然文档没有提供关于N2O-ODHP的全面信息，但它表明使用N2O作为氧化剂所达到的高选择性使其成为丙烯生产进一步研究和开发的一个有前景的方向。
