[1] "It is known that the interaction of N2O with ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely active surface oxygen species discovered by Ref. [1] which was called α-oxygen [2]."

[2] "The α-oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethylene with 96–98% selectivity; it reacts with methane at ambient temperatures to give methanol or converts benzene to phenol at moderate temperatures."

[3] "Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85–95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst."

The literature provided does not directly address the use of N2O in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in the detail requested by the question. However, it does offer some relevant insights:

1. N2O interacts with ZSM-5 zeolites to produce a highly active oxygen species called α-oxygen.

2. This α-oxygen shows high selectivity (96-98%) in converting ethane to ethylene.

3. For propane specifically, the selectivity to propylene is reported to be 85-95% at up to 10% conversion.

4. The catalyst (ZSM-5) experiences rapid deactivation, which is a critical challenge.

The literature does not provide information on other oxidants for comparison, nor does it discuss various catalysts beyond ZSM-5. It also doesn't propose strategies to address catalyst deactivation.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, research could focus on:
1. Developing more stable catalysts that resist deactivation
2. Investigating methods to regenerate the catalyst in-situ
3. Optimizing reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity
4. Exploring catalyst modifications to enhance N2O activation and propylene selectivity

These suggestions are extrapolated from the general challenges mentioned in the text and common approaches in catalysis research, as the document does not provide specific strategies for improvement.

提供的文献并未详细讨论氧化亚氮(N2O)在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的应用，但提供了一些相关见解：

1. N2O与ZSM-5沸石相互作用，产生一种被称为α-氧的高活性氧物种。

2. 这种α-氧在将乙烷转化为乙烯时表现出高选择性(96-98%)。

3. 对于丙烷，在转化率达到10%时，生成丙烯的选择性为85-95%。

4. 催化剂(ZSM-5)经历快速失活，这是一个关键挑战。

文献没有提供其他氧化剂的比较信息，也没有讨论除ZSM-5以外的各种催化剂。它也没有提出解决催化剂失活的策略。

为了使N2O-ODHP更加可行，研究可以集中在：
1. 开发更稳定的、抗失活的催化剂
2. 研究原位再生催化剂的方法
3. 优化反应条件以平衡转化率和选择性
4. 探索催化剂改性以增强N2O活化和丙烯选择性

这些建议是根据文本中提到的一般挑战和催化研究中常见的方法推断出来的，因为文档没有提供具体的改进策略。
