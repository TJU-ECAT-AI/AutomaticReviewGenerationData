Abstract 
The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 over 
CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with a Cr content not exceeding the monolayer was 
investigated. The oxidative role of CO2 in this reaction was discussed on the basis 
of in situ DRS experiments in the 400-850 nm range. Fast reduction of the 
catalyst under propane/CO2 stream was observed by in situ diffuse reflectance 
spectroscopy (DRS) at 873 K.

polymerization of ethylene, oxidation of organic compounds, dehydro-
cyclization of paraffines and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia 
in the presence of excess oxygen [1-5].  
  Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are 
also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-
14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a 
heating medium but also as an oxidant. 
  Studies on dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 have revealed that the 
effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the 
yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials 
(silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) [6,9,12-14]. Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 
supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the 
dehydrogenation reaction [6,13]. Moreover, few studies have reported that over 
the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, 
measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert 
gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing 
Cr content [6,8]. 
  The above observations led us to the conclusion that it is worthwhile to 
extend the studies giving more attention to catalysts with low chromium 
loading. In the present paper we report the results of the dehydrogenation of 
propane in the presence of CO2 over a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with a Cr content 
below the monolayer capacity of silica. The low loading and good dispersion of 
chromium was obtained through the use of the equilibrium adsorption method 
in the catalyst preparation. The oxidative role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation 
process is discussed on the basis of in situ DRS experiments. 
 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
 
  The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the equilibrium adsorption method. 
The standard preparation procedure was as follows: 1.5 g of silica (POCH, 
Poland 334 m2/g) and 150 mL of 0.05 M chromium(III) nitrate (POCH, Poland) 
were placed in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a stirring bar. Enough NH3aq 
was added to the flask to adjust the initial pH to 4.5. The solution was stirred 
for 24 h at room temperature. After that time the precipitate was filtered off, 
washed with distilled water, dried at room temperature and calcined at 923 K 
for 3 h in air. 
  The total amount of Cr ions supported on SiO2 was determined with a 
Perkin Elmer PLASMA 40 ICP emission spectrometer. A VG Scientific ESCA-
3 spectrometer equipped with an AlKα1.2 X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operated at 
12 kV and 20 mA was used for the XPS analyses. EPR spectrum was measured 
on a Bruker ELEXSYS-500 spectrometer at room temperature using a 
microwave frequency of 9.53 GHz and microwave power of 0.01 W. The

63 
 
specific surface area (BET method), the pore size distribution and pore volume 
(BJH method) were calculated from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm at 
77 K. 
  The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence and absence of 
CO2 was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a flow-type stainless steel 
reactor. The feed was a mixture of 12.5 vol.% of propane and 87.5 vol.% of 
carbon dioxide (or helium). The total flow rate was 30 mL/min. Before the test, 
the catalyst sample (500 mg) was first preheated at 873 K in a stream of helium 
(0.5 h, 30 mL/min) and then the reaction was started between 673 and 873 K. 
The analysis of reactants and products was carried out on-line by using two gas 
chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a column packed with 
Porapak Q, and a flame ionization detector (for hydrocarbons C1-C3 analyses). 
The second chromatograph was equipped with a column packed with Carboxen 
1000, and a thermal conductivity detector (for CO, H2 and CO2 analyses). 
  The in situ diffuse reflectance mode was used to trace the change in the 
valence state of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane 
in the presence of CO2, and an oxidative regeneration of the catalyst at 873 K.  
In situ diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained with a StellarNet EPP 2000 
spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reflection attachment and a deuterium-
halogen light source. Prior to the measurements, the catalyst sample (500 mg) 
was preheated in a dry helium flow at 873 K for 0.5 h. The reaction was started 
at 873 K. The dehydrogenation conditions (feed composition and total flow 
rate) were the same as for the catalytic tests.

  The total amount of chromium deposited on the surface of SiO2 is below 
monolayer capacity, which for this system corresponds to 0.6 Cr atoms/nm2 
[15]. The XPS analysis reveals two peaks in the Cr 2p region.  The first peak, at 
the BE value of 577.5 eV, was assigned to Cr3+, and the second, at the BE value 
of 579.8 eV, to Cr6+ [16]. Moreover, the EPR measurement showed a γ-signal 
originating from isolated Cr5+ species [17]. The XPS and EPR results are in 
agreement with the general observation that even if Cr3+ salts are used as 
precursors, after calcination in air the chromium on oxide support is stabilized 
in higher valence states (Cr5+, Cr6+). 
  It has been proposed that the Cr6+/5+ species dispersed on the surface of the 
oxide support are the precursors for the mononuclear surface Cr3+ species with 
two coordinatively unsaturated vacancies. Such Cr3+ species have been assigned 
as the active sites for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [18].

Catalytic and in-situ DRS studies 
 
  Table 2 summarizes the dehydrogenation results obtained in the presence 
and absence of CO2 over the CrOx/SiO2 in the temperature range between 673 
and 873 K. In that temperature range, a promoting role of CO2 on the 
conversion of propane and the yield of propene is found. The selectivity to 
propene both in the presence and absence of CO2 gradually decreases with 
MICHORCZYK, OGONOWSKI: PROPENE 
65 
 
increasing reaction temperature. In addition to propene, light hydrocarbons 
(methane, ethane and ethane) are formed. However, even at 873 K the total sum 
of the selectivities to these by-products is below 9 %.   
  In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in 
the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed. The molar ratio of H2/CO 
drops with increase of the reaction temperature, indicating that CO2 is activated 
at higher temperatures.  
  The effect of contact time (W/F) on the dehydrogenation of propane in the 
presence and absence of CO2 is shown in Fig. 1.

flow rate = 30 mL/min, catalyst weight = 100-1000 mg, measured after 0.2 h on 
stream 
 
 
Both in the presence and absence of CO2, , the yield of propene increases with 
increasing W/F. However, in the presence of CO2, the yield of propene rises 
more steeply than in the inert gas atmosphere. In consequence, the promoting 
effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of propene yield in CO2 to that in He 
atmosphere (YCO2/YHe), increases with increasing W/F (Fig. 1). Propene 
selectivity for the process in He atmosphere was constant, whereas in the 
presence of CO2 slightly dropped at longer W/F. 
  In order to obtain information about the oxidation states of chromium during 
the reaction, in situ DRS experiment was done (Fig. 2). The spectra of the 
catalyst were collected during the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence 
66 
MICHORCZYK, OGONOWSKI: PROPENE 
 
of CO2 at 873 K.  The first scan was done for the fresh CrOx/SiO2 catalyst after 
30 min degassing in He. When the propane/CO2 mixture was introduced, a 
broad absorption band was observed after 1 min on stream with an absorption 
maximum at around 650 nm. This band is assigned to the d-d transition of Cr3+ 
ions [19, 20] and it is suggested that the Cr6+ ions present in the fresh 
CrOx/SiO2 catalyst are reduced during the first minute on stream. With 
increasing time on stream the background absorption increased. This 
unfavorable effect is caused by coke formation (darkening of the catalyst).

stream. Reaction conditions: 873 K, C3H8/CO2 = 1/7 (molar ratio), total flow rate 
= 30 mL/min, catalyst weight = 500 mg  
 
 
  Next, the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was monitored during regeneration 
(Fig. 3). The sample was regenerated first with pulses of carbon dioxide 
(spectra B-D) and then with oxygen (spectra E-H) at 873 K.  The spectra of the 
catalyst treated with CO2 were similar to the spectrum for the reduced catalyst 
(spectrum A). Even after the injection of a 100 times higher amount of CO2 
than that calculated according to the formal reaction: Cr2O3 + 3CO2 = 2CrO3 + 
3CO, the absorbance of the band at 650 nm remains the same (spectrum D). In 
contrast, a drastic decrease in the absorbance at 650 nm is observed after 
treatment of the catalyst with pulses of oxygen (spectra E-H). Each of the 
spectrum was recorded after injection of stoichiometric amount of oxygen 
MICHORCZYK, OGONOWSKI: PROPENE 
67 
 
(calculated according to the reaction: Cr2O3 + 1.5O2 = 2CrO3). After injection 
of the first pulse of oxygen (spectrum E) the band at 650 nm disappeared.  
Injection of three consecutive pulses of oxygen did not change the shape of the 
spectra.

(B-D) and air (E-H). Reaction conditions: temperature 873 K, He carrier gas flow 
rate 30 mL/min 
 
  The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 
catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of 
reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen. Such results suggest 
that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions 
are reoxidized by carbon dioxide to Cr6+ ions, is not the effective way of 
propene formation. 
  As we found previously [21], the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is active both in the 
dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions. This bi-
functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst may be responsible for higher 
propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2. Recently, Ohishi 
et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS 
reaction can proceed via a redox cycle.

According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of 
propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized 
by CO2 (2). 
  On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is 
promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to 
form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ 
species can continue. At higher Cr contents the reduction produces Cr2O3, and 
then it stops, due to the high stability of this oxide [17]. Such redox behaviour 
of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts may explain the previous 
observations [6,8], which reveal that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield 
of propene decreases with increasing Cr content.
