Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document appears to be a title and author list for a research article on supported boron oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not provide any details about the process, oxidants used, or challenges faced. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide an accurate analysis of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP, discuss its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity, describe various catalysts employed, or address challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, I cannot propose strategies or research directions to address limitations or improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP based on the limited information provided.

所提供的文献中没有包含任何关于一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂的信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于负载型氧化硼催化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢的研究文章的标题和作者列表，但没有提供有关该过程、使用的氧化剂或面临的挑战的任何详细信息。由于缺乏相关文本信息，我无法准确分析N2O作为ODHP中的氧化剂，讨论其在丙烯选择性方面的优势，描述所使用的各种催化剂，或解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。此外，基于所提供的有限信息，我也无法提出解决限制或提高N2O-ODHP可行性的策略或研究方向。
