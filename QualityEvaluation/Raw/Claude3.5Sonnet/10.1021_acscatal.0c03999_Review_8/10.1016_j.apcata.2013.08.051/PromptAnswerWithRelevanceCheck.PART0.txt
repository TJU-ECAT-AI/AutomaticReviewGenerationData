Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to answer the question about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The title of the manuscript mentions the use of nitrous oxide over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, but the abstract or full text is not provided. Without more detailed information from the paper, it is not possible to discuss the advantages of N2O in terms of propylene selectivity, compare it to other oxidants, analyze various catalysts employed, or address challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, there is not enough context to propose strategies or research directions to address limitations or improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP for practical implementation.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来回答关于一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用的问题。文稿标题提到了在Fe-ZSM-5催化剂上使用一氧化二氮进行丙烷氧化脱氢，但没有提供摘要或全文。没有更详细的论文信息，无法讨论N2O在丙烯选择性方面的优势，将其与其他氧化剂进行比较，分析所使用的各种催化剂，或解决与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。此外，也没有足够的背景来提出策略或研究方向以解决限制或提高N2O-ODHP实际应用的可行性。
