[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

[6] "This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%. This is consistent with IR spectra (Fig. 3), pointing to a removal of organic species as a result of evacuation at 673 K."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages, primarily in terms of propylene selectivity. While N2O results in lower propane conversion compared to other oxidants, it allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with vanadium-based catalysts being a focus of this study. The ODHP reaction occurs on vanadyl groups, involving oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. The oxidant (N2O in this case) is responsible for vanadium reoxidation.

A critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation and stability. The study shows that propane conversion decreases with time on stream, with higher reaction temperatures leading to faster deactivation. The main cause of deactivation appears to be the reduction of surface vanadium species, rather than carbon deposition. This is attributed to the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to reduction or can be more easily reoxidized by N2O.

2. Process optimization: Find optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, contact time) that balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.

3. Regeneration methods: Improve catalyst regeneration techniques, possibly using a combination of N2O and oxygen to fully restore activity.

4. Support material research: Investigate different support materials that may enhance the stability of vanadium species or improve N2O activation.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth research on the reaction mechanism to better understand and control the factors affecting catalyst deactivation.

6. Promoter addition: Explore the use of promoters that could enhance the ability of N2O to reoxidize vanadium species.

7. Reactor design: Develop reactor designs that allow for continuous catalyst regeneration or more efficient heat management to minimize deactivation.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial application.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂有几个优点，主要体现在丙烯选择性方面。虽然与其他氧化剂相比，N2O导致较低的丙烷转化率，但它可以实现更高的丙烯选择性和更低的碳氧化物选择性。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，本研究重点关注了钒基催化剂。ODHP反应发生在钒氧基团上，涉及氧的移除和随后的钒还原。氧化剂(在这种情况下是N2O)负责钒的再氧化。

N2O-ODHP面临的一个关键挑战是催化剂的失活和稳定性。研究表明，丙烷转化率随着反应时间的延长而降低，更高的反应温度导致更快的失活。失活的主要原因似乎是表面钒物种的还原，而不是碳沉积。这归因于N2O再氧化还原态钒物种的能力有限。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发更耐还原或更易被N2O再氧化的催化剂。

2. 工艺优化：找到平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性的最佳反应条件（温度、压力、接触时间）。

3. 再生方法：改进催化剂再生技术，可能使用N2O和氧气的组合来完全恢复活性。

4. 载体材料研究：研究可能增强钒物种稳定性或改善N2O活化的不同载体材料。

5. 机理研究：对反应机理进行更深入的研究，以更好地理解和控制影响催化剂失活的因素。

6. 添加助剂：探索使用可以增强N2O再氧化钒物种能力的助剂。

7. 反应器设计：开发允许连续催化剂再生或更有效热管理的反应器设计，以最小化失活。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP目前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
