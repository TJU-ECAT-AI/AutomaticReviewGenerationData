[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

[6] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity"

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. N2O allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides compared to other oxidants, despite resulting in lower propane conversion.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with vanadium-based catalysts being a prominent choice. The ODHP reaction occurs on vanadyl groups, involving oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. N2O is responsible for reoxidizing the reduced vanadium species.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP. The main issue is the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, which leads to catalyst deactivation over time. This deactivation is more pronounced at higher reaction temperatures.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved resistance to reduction or enhanced ability to be reoxidized by N2O.

2. Reaction conditions optimization: Find optimal temperature and pressure conditions that balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.

3. Regeneration methods: Explore more efficient regeneration techniques, possibly combining N2O with small amounts of oxygen to fully restore catalyst activity.

4. Support material engineering: Investigate support materials that can stabilize the active vanadium species and promote easier reoxidation.

5. Promoter addition: Study the effect of promoters that could enhance N2O's ability to reoxidize the catalyst without compromising selectivity.

6. Reactor design: Develop reactor configurations that allow for continuous catalyst regeneration or minimize the extent of deactivation.

7. Alternative oxidants: Explore the use of N2O in combination with other mild oxidants to balance reactivity and selectivity.

By focusing research efforts on these directions, it may be possible to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop a more practical and efficient process for propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂有几个优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。尽管导致较低的丙烷转化率，N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性和更低的碳氧化物选择性。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中钒基催化剂是一个突出的选择。ODHP反应发生在钒酰基团上，涉及氧气移除和随后的钒还原。N2O负责重新氧化还原的钒物种。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临着与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。主要问题是N2O重新氧化还原钒物种的能力有限，导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。这种失活在较高的反应温度下更为明显。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以探索以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有improved抗还原能力或enhanced被N2O重新氧化能力的催化剂。

2. 反应条件优化：找到平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性的最佳温度和压力条件。

3. 再生方法：探索更有效的再生技术，可能将N2O与少量氧气结合使用，以完全恢复催化剂活性。

4. 载体材料工程：研究能够稳定活性钒物种并促进更容易重新氧化的载体材料。

5. 助剂添加：研究可以增强N2O重新氧化催化剂能力而不影响选择性的助剂效果。

6. 反应器设计：开发允许连续催化剂再生或最小化失活程度的反应器配置。

7. 替代氧化剂：探索将N2O与其他温和氧化剂结合使用，以平衡反应性和选择性。

通过集中研究努力在这些方向上，可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，并开发出更实用、更高效的丙烯生产工艺。
