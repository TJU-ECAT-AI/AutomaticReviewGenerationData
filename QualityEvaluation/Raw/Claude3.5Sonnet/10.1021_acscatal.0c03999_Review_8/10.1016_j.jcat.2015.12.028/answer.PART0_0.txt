[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

[6] "This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity"

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides, although it results in lower propane conversion. This is due to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species, which occurs without forming highly reactive peroxovanadates that can lead to over-oxidation.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with vanadium-based catalysts being prominent. The study focuses on vanadium catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (SBA-3), with vanadyl groups playing a crucial role in the ODHP reaction.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. The main issue is the reduction of vanadium species during the reaction, which leads to decreased activity over time. This deactivation is more pronounced at higher temperatures. Carbonaceous deposits play a minor role in deactivation, as evidenced by the very small amount of carbon found in the spent catalyst.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Developing catalysts with improved resistance to reduction or enhanced ability to be reoxidized by N2O.
2. Investigating catalyst supports or promoters that can stabilize vanadium in its active state.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions, such as temperature and contact time, to balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.
4. Exploring in-situ regeneration methods, possibly combining N2O with small amounts of oxygen to maintain catalyst activity.
5. Investigating novel catalyst designs, such as core-shell structures or bimetallic systems, to enhance stability and selectivity.
6. Studying the mechanism of vanadium reduction and reoxidation in more detail to guide catalyst design.
7. Exploring the use of continuous regeneration systems or moving bed reactors to maintain catalyst activity.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有几个优势。N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性和更低的碳氧化物选择性，尽管它导致较低的丙烷转化率。这是由于N2O重新氧化还原态钒物种的能力较低，且不会形成高反应活性的过氧钒酸盐，从而避免过度氧化。

这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中钒基催化剂最为突出。该研究主要关注负载在介孔二氧化硅（SBA-3）上的钒催化剂，其中钒酰基团在ODHP反应中起着关键作用。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性方面存在重大挑战。主要问题是反应过程中钒物种的还原，导致活性随时间降低。这种失活在较高温度下更为显著。碳质沉积物在失活中起的作用较小，这从spent催化剂中发现的极少量碳可以得到证实。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以探索以下几种策略：

1. 开发具有更强抗还原能力或更容易被N2O重新氧化的催化剂。
2. 研究可以稳定钒活性状态的催化剂载体或促进剂。
3. 优化反应条件，如温度和接触时间，以平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性。
4. 探索原位再生方法，可能将N2O与少量氧气结合使用，以维持催化剂活性。
5. 研究新型催化剂设计，如核壳结构或双金属系统，以提高稳定性和选择性。
6. 更详细地研究钒的还原和再氧化机理，以指导催化剂设计。
7. 探索使用连续再生系统或移动床反应器以维持催化剂活性。

这些研究方向有可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择。
