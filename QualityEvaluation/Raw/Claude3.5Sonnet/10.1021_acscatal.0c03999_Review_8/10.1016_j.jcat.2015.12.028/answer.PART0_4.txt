[1] "The application of N2O as an oxidant for propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion, allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides [15]."

[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates [16]."

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "To estimate the possible role of the carbonaceous deposit in catalyst deactivation, an analysis of carbon present in the spent catalyst was conducted. This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%."

[6] "Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible for catalyst deactivation."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalyst by heating under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxidation in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity (Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials)."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides, despite resulting in lower propane conversion. This is due to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen, which prevents the formation of highly reactive peroxovanadates that can lead to over-oxidation of propene.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with vanadium-based catalysts being particularly prominent. The study focuses on vanadium catalysts supported on mesoporous silica SBA-3, with vanadium loadings ranging from 1 to 7 wt%.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include:

1. Reduction of vanadium species: The main cause of catalyst deactivation is the reduction of vanadium species, which occurs as part of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism during the ODH reaction.

2. Temperature sensitivity: Higher reaction temperatures lead to faster catalyst deactivation.

3. Limited reoxidation by N2O: The ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species is less than that of oxygen, which contributes to the gradual deactivation of the catalyst.

4. Carbonaceous deposits: Although the formation of carbonaceous deposits has a minimal impact on catalyst deactivation in this study, it may still play a role in long-term stability.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved stability and resistance to reduction, possibly by incorporating promoters or modifying the support material.

2. Optimized reaction conditions: Find the optimal balance between temperature, contact time, and N2O concentration to maximize propene yield while minimizing catalyst deactivation.

3. Regeneration methods: Improve catalyst regeneration techniques, possibly by using a combination of N2O and oxygen treatments at different temperatures.

4. Alternative oxidants: Explore the use of mixed oxidants (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance selectivity and catalyst stability.

5. In-situ catalyst characterization: Employ advanced spectroscopic techniques to better understand the catalyst deactivation mechanism and develop targeted solutions.

6. Reactor design: Investigate novel reactor configurations that could enhance catalyst stability and facilitate continuous regeneration.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a more selective and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional propane dehydrogenation processes could be realized.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势。N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性和更低的碳氧化物选择性，尽管导致丙烷转化率降低。这是因为N2O重新氧化还原钒物种的能力比氧气低，从而防止了形成高反应性的过氧钒酸盐，这些过氧钒酸盐可能导致丙烯过度氧化。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中以钒基催化剂最为突出。该研究主要关注负载在介孔二氧化硅SBA-3上的钒催化剂，钒负载量从1到7重量百分比不等。

N2O-ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 钒物种的还原：催化剂失活的主要原因是钒物种的还原，这是ODH反应过程中Mars-van Krevelen机制的一部分。

2. 温度敏感性：更高的反应温度导致催化剂更快失活。

3. N2O的有限重氧化能力：N2O重新氧化还原钒物种的能力比氧气低，这导致催化剂逐渐失活。

4. 碳质沉积物：尽管在本研究中碳质沉积物的形成对催化剂失活的影响很小，但它可能仍然影响长期稳定性。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有improved稳定性和抗还原性的催化剂，可能通过添加助剂或改性支撑材料。

2. 优化反应条件：找到温度、接触时间和N2O浓度之间的最佳平衡，以最大化丙烯产率同时最小化催化剂失活。

3. 再生方法：改进催化剂再生技术，可能通过在不同温度下使用N2O和氧气的组合处理。

4. 替代氧化剂：探索混合氧化剂（如N2O + O2）的使用，以平衡选择性和催化剂稳定性。

5. 原位催化剂表征：采用先进的光谱技术更好地理解催化剂失活机制，并开发有针对性的解决方案。

6. 反应器设计：研究新型反应器配置，可能增强催化剂稳定性并促进连续再生。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP作为传统丙烷脱氢过程的一种更具选择性和环境友好的替代方案的潜力可能会实现。
