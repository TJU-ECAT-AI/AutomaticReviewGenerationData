[2] "According to the quoted authors [15], propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants (O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation."

[3] "Reoxidation of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the temporary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subsequent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation of peroxovanadates"

[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[5] "Considering the limited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species, one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. N2O allows for higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon oxides, despite resulting in lower propane conversion. This selectivity advantage is attributed to the lower ability of N2O to reoxidize reduced vanadium species compared to oxygen, which prevents the formation of highly reactive peroxovanadates that can lead to over-oxidation of propene.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, with vanadium-based catalysts being prominently featured in this study. The catalysts typically contain vanadyl groups where the propane-to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs, involving oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction.

However, the process faces critical challenges related to catalyst deactivation and stability. The main issue is the reduction of surface vanadium species, which is not efficiently counteracted by N2O due to its limited ability to reoxidize these species. This leads to a decrease in propane conversion over time, with higher reaction temperatures accelerating the deactivation process.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to reduction or can maintain activity even in a partially reduced state.

2. Oxidant mixture: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance selectivity and catalyst stability.

3. Regeneration protocols: Optimize regeneration procedures, possibly using oxygen or other stronger oxidants periodically to fully restore catalyst activity.

4. Temperature management: Explore lower temperature operation or improved heat management to slow down the deactivation process.

5. Continuous regeneration: Design reactor systems that allow for continuous or cyclic regeneration of the catalyst without interrupting the process.

6. Support material optimization: Investigate support materials that can enhance the stability of active vanadium species or facilitate their reoxidation.

7. Promoter addition: Explore the use of promoters that can enhance N2O activation or improve the stability of active sites.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial application.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比具有几个优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。尽管导致较低的丙烷转化率，但N2O允许更高的丙烯选择性和更低的碳氧化物选择性。这种选择性优势归因于N2O相比氧气重新氧化还原态钒物种的能力较弱，从而防止形成高反应性的过氧钒酸盐，这些过氧钒酸盐可能导致丙烯的过度氧化。

在N2O-ODHP中使用了各种催化剂，本研究中以钒基催化剂为主。这些催化剂通常含有钒酰基团，丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应在这些基团上进行，涉及氧的移除和随后的钒还原。

然而，该过程面临着与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。主要问题是表面钒物种的还原，由于N2O重新氧化这些物种的能力有限，无法有效地对抗这一问题。这导致丙烷转化率随时间降低，而更高的反应温度会加速失活过程。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以探索几种策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发更耐还原或在部分还原状态下仍能保持活性的催化剂。

2. 氧化剂混合：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以平衡选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 再生协议：优化再生程序，可能定期使用氧气或其他更强的氧化剂来完全恢复催化剂活性。

4. 温度管理：探索低温操作或改进热管理，以减缓失活过程。

5. 连续再生：设计允许在不中断过程的情况下连续或循环再生催化剂的反应器系统。

6. 载体材料优化：研究可以增强活性钒物种稳定性或促进其重新氧化的载体材料。

7. 添加助剂：探索使用可以增强N2O活化或改善活性位点稳定性的助剂。

这些研究方向可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
