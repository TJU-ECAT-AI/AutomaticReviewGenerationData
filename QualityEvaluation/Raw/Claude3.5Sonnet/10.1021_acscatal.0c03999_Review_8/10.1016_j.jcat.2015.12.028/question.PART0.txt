Propane-to-propene oxide oxidation was carried out at 673 and 703 K and for different contact times on
vanadium catalyst supported on mesoporous silica of SBA-3 structure in the presence of N2O as an oxi-
dant. For comparison, direct propene epoxidation was also investigated. Vanadium catalysts for propane
oxidation undergo deactivation with time on stream. It was noted that the higher the reaction tempera-
ture the faster the deactivation. The very small amount of coke deposit in the spent catalyst would indi-
cate that the vanadium reduction is responsible for catalyst deactivation. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to
study the adsorbed surface species involved in the selective propane oxidation. Considering the alteration
of selectivity toward oxygen-bearing products with propane/propene conversion influenced by reaction
temperature and contact time, some tentative reaction paths for the selective oxidation of propane have
been proposed.

1. Introduction
Propene oxide (PO), one of the most important intermediates, is
mainly produced by the multistep chlorohydrin method, which
results in a large amount of useless chloride-containing waste, or
by the organic hydroperoxide process. Recently, a new clean tech-
nology, based on the application of hydrogen peroxide as an oxi-
dant, has been developed, with the first installation in Antwerp
[1]. Nevertheless, considering the cost of highly concentrated
hydrogen peroxide and also some risk of uncontrolled H2O2
decomposition, the search for a new and more effective technology
for PO production still continues. Direct oxidation of propene to
propene oxide was performed on various catalysts with oxygen
[24], an oxygenhydrogen mixture [5,6], and nitrous oxide [7
9] as oxidants. Depending on the applied catalyst as well as the
oxidant used, propene conversion and selectivity to PO differed
significantly. When iron-modified silica was applied, a decrease
in propene conversion with time on stream was observed [7],
while selectivity to PO remained stable. Reoxidation of the catalyst
restored the initial activity. According to Nijhuis and Weckhuysen
[10], the introduction of water vapor on goldtitania catalyst
applied for propene-to-PO oxidation in the presence of hydrogen
and oxygen reduced the catalyst deactivation, even though some-
what lower conversion was noted.
Propene applied as a starting material for PO production is usu-
ally manufactured by steam cracking or fluid cracking of higher
hydrocarbons. Both processes are energy-intensive, as they are
performed at high temperature (usually at about 1000 K). Propene
may also be obtained by oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of pro-
pane under much milder conditions on iron [11]- or vanadium
[12]-containing catalysts with oxygen [1214] or nitrous oxide
[11,13,14] as oxidants. The application of N2O as an oxidant for
propane ODH, despite resulting in lower propane conversion,
allows higher propene selectivity and lower selectivity to carbon
oxides [15]. According to the quoted authors [15], propane-
to-propene oxydehydrogenation occurs on vanadyl groups with
oxygen removal and subsequent vanadium reduction. Oxidants
(O2 or N2O) are responsible for vanadium reoxidation. Reoxidation
of vanadium species by oxygen is very fast and results in the tem-
porary formation of peroxovanadates, highly reactive to subse-
quent propene oxidation. The ability of N2O to reoxidize the
reduced vanadium species is less and occurs without the formation
of peroxovanadates [16].
As both iron and vanadium catalysts on different silica supports
in the presence of N2O and under similar conditions (reaction tem-
perature in the range of 573723 K), showed activity both for pro-
pane ODH [11,14] and propene-to-PO oxidation [7,8,17], it seemed
reasonable to perform the direct processing of propane to propene

oxide. Bravo-Surez et al. [18] indicated that a combination of two
catalysts, Au/TiO2 and Au/TS-1, may catalyze the direct synthesis of
propene oxide from propane with a H2 and O2 mixture as an oxi-
dant at a relatively low temperature, 443 K. On the other hand,
Song et al. [19] have found that propene oxide is formed only from
propene, not from propane, when silica-supported molybdenum
oxide is used with oxygen as an oxidant.
In the present study we have used vanadium catalysts at differ-
ent vanadium concentrations (17 wt.%) supported on mesoporous
silica support (SBA-3) as catalysts for direct oxidation of propane to
propene oxide using N2O as an oxidant. It has been shown that
depending on vanadium loading, various VOx species (monomers,
dimers, polymers, and bulk V2O5 crystals) are formed on the sur-
face of catalysts. According to our earlier results [16], the presence
of monomeric VOx species formed up to monolayer coverage favors
the propene epoxidation reaction. Kondratenko et al. [14,20] have
also indicated that up to monolayer coverage with VOx species
(noted for about 5 wt.% of vanadium on MCM-41), an increase in
the rate of propene formation in ODH was observed. Considering
the above, we applied vanadium catalysts comprising 17 wt.% of
vanadium with a density in the range of 0.081.13 V/nm2 (near-
monolayer coverage) as catalysts for direct oxidation of propane
to propene oxide. The possible paths for the transformation of pro-
pane to propene and to related oxygen-containing products were
also estimated on the basis of catalytic results and FT-IR spectra
of adsorbed hydrocarbons (propane, propene), the mixture of
reagents (propane/propene with N2O), and propene oxide.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
SBA-3 was used as a supporting material for vanadium oxide
species. The mesoporous material was prepared by hydrothermal
synthesis according to a procedure described elsewhere [21]. The
synthesis was performed under acidic conditions. The initial mole
ratio of the reaction mixture was as follows: 0.11 TEOS:0.025
CTAB:1.94 HCl:9.17 H2O. The SBA-3 support was prepared using
the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB,
P98%, Aldrich) as the template, and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS,
P99%, Aldrich) as the silica source. TEOS (23 cm3) and 34 cm3 of
hydrochloric acid (38%, POCH) were dissolved in 165 cm3 of deion-
ized water followed by addition of 8.3 g of CTAB. The mixture was
stirred at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution.
After this, an additional 36 cm3 of hydrochloric acid was added,
which resulted in the precipitation of a white gel. The mixture
was stirred for up to 1 h at room temperature. The gel was crystal-
lized at room temperature for 8 days. The product was then
washed with deionized water, filtered, and dried at 373 K. Finally,
the sample was calcined in air under static conditions at 823 K for
8 h (with a heating rate of 1 K/min). The modification of the SBA-3
matrix
with
vanadium
ions
was
performed
by
the
wet-
impregnation method using an aqueous solution of VOSO4 (97%,
Aldrich) with the amount required for 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.% of V. A
quantity of 10 g of SBA-3 support was impregnated with a 0.1 M
aqueous solution of VOSO4 by the incipient wetness method (time
of impregnation 46 h), using the volume of the solution required
for the intended vanadium concentration. The obtained samples
were dried at 373 K and calcined at 823 K in air under static condi-
tions for 1 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The correctness of the mesostructure of the as-synthesized and
the vanadium-modified SBA-3 samples was checked by powder X-
ray diffraction (XRD), which was performed on a Bruker AXS D8
Advance diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (k = 0.154 nm). The
BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area and the average pore
diameter were estimated from N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms
collected at 77 K on a Quantachrome Nova 1000e sorptometer.
Typically, about 0.2 g of sample was used for the measurement
and the sample was degassed at 575 K prior to nitrogen adsorption
at 77 K. The content of vanadium introduced into SBA-3 was esti-
mated from ICP (inductively coupled plasma) measurements per-
formed on a Varian ICP-OES VISTA-MPX spectrometer.
Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UVvis regions of dehydrated
samples (calcined at 673 K) were recorded in the reflectance func-
tion mode (F(R)) in the range 800200 nm on a Varian Cary 100
spectrophotometer. The spectra were recorded at room tempera-
ture (RT) using BaSO4 as a reference material.
H2 TPR profiles were obtained by heating the catalysts from 300
to 1000 K at a rate of 10 K/min. under H2/Ar flow (70 cm3/min)
using a homemade apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. A
quartz microreactor was charged with 0.03 g of catalyst (sieve frac-
tion 0.30.5 mm).
The decomposition of propan-2-ol to propene was studied at
493 and 523 K by the pulse method using helium as a carrier
gas. A quantity of 0.2 g of the sample and 0.5 ll of propan-2-ol
were applied and the total flow rate of helium amounted to
30 cm3/min. Analysis of products was performed by gas chro-
matography with FID detection.
2.3. FTIR spectroscopy
IR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Vector 22 Spectropho-
tometer using a homemade quartz infrared cell with CaF2 windows
connected to a vacuum dosing system. This cell was designed and
built at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan
 . The catalyst
powder was pressed into a self-supporting disc of around 20 mg/
cm2 and activated at 673 K under vacuum (<104 Torr) for 2 h
before adsorption experiments. Adsorption of propane, propene,
propene oxide, or reagent mixture (propane/propene and N2O)
was performed at room temperature (RT) for 30 min followed by
subsequent heating to different temperatures: 373, 473, 573,
673, and 703 K (spectra were recorded after 30 min contact of
the gas phase with the catalyst surface at selected temperatures
and cooling of the sample to RT). Typical gas-phase partial pres-
sures were 20 Torr of propane, 20 Torr of propene, 20 Torr of
N2O, and 2 Torr of propene oxide. After exposure of the catalyst
surface to the substrates, products, or reagent mixture, it was evac-
uated at room temperature for 1 h and subsequently at 673 K for
1 h. All spectra were collected at room temperature with a resolu-
tion of 4 cm1 by accumulating 75 scans. In the paper the differen-
tial spectra are presented (after subtraction of the activated
catalyst spectrum).
2.4. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests for propane and propene oxidation were per-
formed in the presence of N2O as an oxidant in a continuous-
flow reactor at two different temperatures: 673 and 703 K. The
experiments were carried out under atmospheric pressure using
different contact times: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s. Propane or pro-
pene and N2O (propane: 99.5 vol.% and propene: 99.5 vol.% from
Linde and N2O: 99.995 vol.% from Messer) were diluted with
helium (P99.9999 vol.%, Linde) and the flow rates of propane/pro-
pene:nitrous oxide:helium were 1:15:x cm3/min, where x = 100,
41, 24, 12.5, and 8 cm3/min, related to different contact times.
The total flow rate of the gases was equal to 116, 57, 40, 28.5,
and 24 cm3/min, respectively. The composition of the reaction inlet
flow was controlled by mass flow controllers (MFC Brooks). In the
24

oxidation reaction 0.5 g of catalyst (sieve fraction 0.30.5 mm) was
loaded into a fixed-bed glass reactor (10 mm i.d.). Catalyst bed
temperature was controlled by a thermocouple. Prior to the mea-
surements, the catalyst was heated in the helium flow (12.5 cm3/
min) at 673 K for 30 min. The effluent from the reactor was ana-
lyzed

Conversion and selectivity values were determined on the basis
of the moles of propane/propene feed and products, considering
the number of carbon atoms in each molecule. The catalytic activ-
ities were calculated as

where Z = propene oxide, propionaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, COx

The coke content on the studied catalysts (after 1 h on stream)
was determined on the basis of elemental analysis (carbon and
hydrogen) using a vario EL III element analyzer. The results of
the elemental analysis of the coke accumulated during 1 h of the
reaction were used to estimate the amount of propane/propene
converted to carbonaceous deposit (coke), which was indispens-
able for performing carbon balance. The carbon balance was
100  1% for propane oxidation, while for propene oxidation it
was kept within 98%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The correctness of the mesostructure of as-synthesized and
vanadium-modified SBA-3 was confirmed by XRD results displayed
in Fig. 1. Incorporation of different amounts of vanadium (1, 3, 5,
and 7 wt.%) resulted in some modification of XRD diffraction pat-
terns; nevertheless, the hexagonally ordered structure of the meso-
porous supports was still preserved. The surface area of SBA-3 was
1641 m2/g and it decreased remarkably after the incorporation of
vanadium (Table 1). UVvis and H2 TPR measurements revealed
that below the monolayer coverage, well-dispersed vanadium spe-
cies are present in xV/SBA-3 catalysts (Figs. 1S and 2S, Supplemen-
tary Materials). A characterization of the studied catalysts has
already been reported in our earlier paper [17].
3.2. FT-IR results on adsorption of reagents and propene oxide
3.2.1. FT-IR results on adsorption of propane and propene
The interaction of propane and propene with the surface of 5V/
SBA-3 was studied using FT-IR spectroscopy. Adsorption of the
reagent molecule was performed in the temperature range from
RT to 673 K. The spectra obtained after adsorption of propane
and propene recorded without gas phase (after the subtraction of
the IR spectrum of the fresh sample) are presented in Fig. 2AD,
respectively. The spectra were recorded after hydrocarbon interac-
tion at different temperatures (RT, 473 K, and 673 K). Propane
adsorption results in the formation of CAH bands in the stretching
vibration region (two significant bands at 2964 and 2875 cm1,
accompanied by three shoulders at 2985, 2940, and 2903 cm1)
(Fig.
2A)
and
in
the
bending
vibration
range
(1467
and
1377 cm1) (Fig. 2B). The intensity of the bands in the range
28003000 cm1 was hardly affected by the temperature. Starting
from 473 K, the weak band at 1620 cm1 appears and significantly
increases along with the temperature rise. This band can be attrib-
uted to monodentate carbonate. A similar observation has been
made by Mul et al. [22] after a longer exposure of the surface of
catalysts to contact with propene. The increase in the intensity of
this band, along with the temperature increase, suggests a stronger
interaction of adsorbed propane with oxygen surface species at
higher temperatures. The presence of monodentate carbonate sug-
gests the interaction of adsorbed propane with oxygen from the
catalyst surface.
Propene adsorption results in the formation of bands located at
3080, 2980, 2950, and 2925 cm1, accompanied by shoulders at
2894 and 2859 cm1. Similarly, as after propane adsorption, those
bands are not affected by the temperature. In the bending vibration
range two intense bands appeared at 1640 and 1457 cm1, with a
low intense band at 1437 cm1. The band at 1640 cm1 is due to
C@C stretching vibration and is shifted to lower frequencies com-
pared with the gas phase (1653 cm1), which suggests a significant
interaction with the catalyst surface [23]. Heating up to 673 K
resulted in the transformation of propene on the catalyst surface.
At 673 K, additional broad bands appeared with maxima at 1605
and 1680 cm1. The band at 1680 cm1 can be ascribed to the
C@O stretching vibration of an adsorbed carbonyl compound,
whereas the broad band at about 1600 cm1 may be attributed
to as(COOH) carboxylate species and is possibly a product of fur-
ther oxidation.
On the basis of these observations, it is clear that propane and
propene in the absence of an oxidant result in the formation of dif-
ferent adsorbed species upon contact with a catalyst surface. Pro-
pane is relatively weakly adsorbed on the surface of 5V/SBA-3
and does not undergo transformation even at 673 K, whereas the
contact of propene with a catalyst surface at higher temperatures
results in the formation of carbonyls and carboxylates. Similar
observations were made by Finocchio et al. [23,24] for a MgCr2O4
catalyst.
3.2.2. FT-IR results on adsorption of reagent mixture (propane/propene
and N2O)
In order to investigate the species formed during the oxidation
reaction, the catalyst surface was exposed to contact with
reagents: propane/propene and N2O at different temperatures

the contact of 5V/SBA-3 with the mixture of propane and N2O
are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra recorded after 30 min contact of
the propane/N2O mixture with the catalyst surface in the temper-
ature range from RT to 673 K are similar to the spectra of adsorbed

propane (shown in Fig. 2A and B). Adsorption of propane and N2O
mixture up to 673 K results only in very weak bands corresponding
to some traces of oxygenates (propionaldehyde, acetone, and acro-
lein, characterized by the presence of carbonyl groups). Only an
increase of the interaction temperature to 703 K resulted in the
formation of an intense carbonyl band at 1680 cm1 with a shoul-
der at 1720 cm1. These bands indicate the formation of aldehydes
and ketones during the oxidation reaction. According to Mul et al.
[25] and Finocchio et al. [23], the band at ca. 1680 cm1 can be
assigned to the carbonyl group of acrolein, whereas the band at
ca. 1720 cm1 may indicate the presence of acetone and/or propi-
onaldehyde. These results are consistent with the catalytic data
indicating the formation of propionaldehyde, acrolein, and acetone
in a propane oxidation reaction that was performed in a flow reac-
tor (results presented in Fig. 6 in Section 3.3). The intensity of the
band at 1620 cm1, which indicates the presence of monodentate
carbonate, significantly increases after reagent adsorption at
703 K. This may result from the overlapping of this band with
the band of the water molecule formed as a result of the oxidation
reaction. Bands characteristic of adsorbed propene oxide were not
registered as a result of the contact of propane/N2O mixture with
the catalyst surface. This is probably due to the long contact time
of the reaction mixture with the catalyst surface, which results in
the transformation of PO to other oxygenates.
The IR spectrum recorded in the range of the CAH stretching
vibration indicates strong bands typical of adsorbed propane (at
2930, 2960, and 2980 cm1), which practically do not change with
the temperature. Bands that fall in the range 30002800 cm1 are
easily removable after evacuation at RT.
The IR spectra after propene and N2O adsorption on 5V/SBA-3
are presented in Fig. 4. Similarly, as in the case of propane and
N2O adsorption, the spectra recorded up to 573 K resemble the
spectra of adsorbed propene (Fig. 2C and D). However, at 673 K,
distinct bands characteristic of carbonyls (1710 and 1690 cm1)
appeared. Additionally, broad bands at approximately 1550 and
1450 cm1 were registered. These bands can be attributed to car-
boxylates formed as a product of the further oxidation of carbonyl
compounds. Carboxylate species are very stable and were not
removed even after evacuation at 673 K. According to Mul et al.
[22,25], these species are transformed to carbonaceous ones and
are responsible for catalyst deactivation. At 673 K a broad band
with a maximum located at 1620 cm1 appeared. This band may
indicate the presence of monodentate carbonate; however, it
may overlap with the band of water formed as a result of the oxi-
dation reaction.
On the basis of the presented results, one may conclude that V/
SBA-3 catalysts after the exposure to propene and N2O reaction
mixture are more susceptible to carbonaceous deposit formation,
resulting in catalyst deactivation, when compared to propane/
N2O mixture.
3.2.3. FT-IR results on adsorption of propene oxide
Propene oxide was adsorbed on the 5V/SBA-3 surface in order
to investigate the interaction of PO with the surface species along
with increasing temperature. The spectra presented in Fig. 5 were
collected after PO adsorption at different temperatures (RT, 373,
473, 573, and 673 K) followed by evacuation at RT and 673 K.
The interaction of PO with the surface species of the 5V/SBA-3
catalyst recorded in the range of OH vibrations showed a negative
band located at 3744 cm1 (Fig. 3S, Supplementary Materials) indi-
cating a strong interaction of PO with the silanol SiAOH groups of
the applied catalyst. This band is very little affected either by the
temperature of PO adsorption or by evacuation, which could sug-
gest the occurrence of a chemical transformation of PO with the
formation of chemical species strongly interacting with the OH
groups. According to Mul et al. [25], the irreversibly adsorbed spe-
cies are most probably formed upon the opening of the epoxide
ring after its contact with acidic OH groups.
The CAH stretching region of adsorbed PO is presented in
Fig. 5A. After PO adsorption, bands appear at ca. 3060, 3002,
2980, 2936, and 2875 cm1. The strong bands located in the vicin-
ity of 3060 cm1 and 3002 cm1 and recorded in the temperature
range from RT up to 573 K were attributed by Mul et al. [25] to a
CAH bond in CH2 and CH groups in propene oxide. Along with an
increase in the temperature of PO adsorption, significant changes
in this region of the spectrum are observed. The intensity of the
bands at 3060 cm1 (related to the CH2 stretching vibration of
the methylene group) and 3002 cm1 (related to the methyl CAH
stretching vibration of PO) decreases, and at a temperature of
573 K these bands almost disappear. Simultaneously, the intensity

of the band at approximately 2875 cm1 increases. These changes
indicate a transformation of propene oxide, along with the temper-
ature of interaction, with the formation of new compounds
strongly adsorbed on 5V/SBA-3 surface.
Similar changes in the IR spectrum are also observed in the
range of CAH bending vibrations (Fig. 5B). The bands at 1492,
1448, and 1410 cm1 (CH2 and CH3 bending and deformation
mode) almost disappear after interaction with the catalysts at
573 K. At the same time, a new band at 1730 cm1 had already
appeared at 573 K. Together with the increase in the PO adsorption
temperature, this band broadens toward lower wavenumbers, with
maxima located at 1730, 1710, 1690, and 1640 cm1. The bands,
assigned to C@O stretching vibration, indicate that a significant
amount of adsorbed PO was converted to an oxidized carbonyl sur-
face species. According to Mul et al. [25] and Finocchio et al.
[23,24], the band at 1730 cm1 can be assigned to adsorbed propa-
nal, the band at 1710 cm1 to acetone, and the band at 1690 cm1
indicates the presence of acrolein. The band at about 1640 cm1,
which is already registered at RT and whose intensity increases
with increasing temperature, can be assigned to the C@C and
CAO stretching of allyl alkoxide species [23]. Starting from 673 K,

bands are still present, which points to a strong interaction of
the related compounds with the catalyst surface. They markedly
decrease only after evacuation at 673 K and they can be assigned
to the formate and acetate species formed upon further carbonyl
transformation.
3.3. Propane oxidation
Catalysts applied for propane oxidation were selected on the
basis of our earlier experiments [17,26] and also through reference
to the literature [27]. In our earlier studies [17], vanadium catalysts
supported on different silica mesoporous matrices (SBA-3, SBA-15,
and MCM-41) were used in propene epoxidation. From among
vanadium-modified mesoporous silicas, the SBA-3 matrix (with
diameter about 2 nm) showed the highest activity for the studied
reaction. This high activity was attributed to relatively narrow
pores allowing intimate contact of reagents with active centers
[28]. Taking this into consideration, the catalysts applied for
propane-to-propene oxide oxidation were supported on SBA-3
support.
The initial experiments for propane oxidation were performed
at 673 and 703 K for a contact time equal to 2.1 s on samples of
1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.% of vanadium supported on mesoporous silica.
The best catalytic performance (expressed in STY of POTable 1)
was observed for the sample containing 5 wt.% vanadium. Taking
this into account, a vanadium catalyst composed of approximately
5 wt.% of vanadium supported on mesoporous silica SBA-3 was
used in further studies as a potential catalyst for the direct oxida-
tion of propane to propene oxide. Propane oxidation performed
under an excess of N2O (propane:N2O = 1:15the reagent ratio
usually applied for propene to PO oxidation [7,29]), when com-
pared to the reagent ratio usually applied for the ODH reaction
(N2O:propane = 1:1 [14] or 1.5:1 [26,30]) resulted not only in pro-
pene and COx formation, but also in a significant amount of
oxygen-bearing compounds: propene oxide (PO), propionaldehyde
(PA), acetone (ACT), and acrolein (ACR) (Fig. 6). The formation of
small amounts of oxygenates in the propane ODH reaction per-
formed with N2O [30,31] and especially with oxygen as oxidants
[32], and also with a hydrogenoxygen mixture [33], has been
reported previously in the literature.
The activity of vanadium catalysts for propane oxidation was
measured at 673 and 703 K (Fig. 6A and B) for a reaction time up
to 2 h and at different contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s)
(Fig. 7). Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and
it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster
the deactivation. When the reaction proceeded at 673 K (contact
time 2.1 s), about 50% of the initial propane conversion was still
observed after 120 min. on stream (Fig. 6A), while at 703 K, the
propane conversion decreased dramatically and after the same
time on stream only 10% of the initial value was found (Fig. 6B).
Simultaneously with propane conversion decrease, selectivity to
propene and COx (CO, CO2) diminishes. Interestingly enough, selec-
tivity toward COx was low throughout the whole range of applied
temperatures. This may be explained on the basis of an earlier sug-
gestion indicating that both direct oxidation of propane to COx and
consecutive propene oxidation to COx are strongly inhibited when
N2O is applied as an oxidant [15]. This results from the lower abil-
ity of N2O (when compared to oxygen) to reoxidize reduced vana-
dium species, which brings about a lowering in the concentration
of oxidized vanadyl species required both for propane oxidation
and for COx formation.
A lowering of propane conversion with time on stream may
result either from carbonaceous deposit or from the reduction of

vanadium species only slowly reoxidised by N2O oxidant. It has
been shown [14,27,34] that propane oxidative dehydrogenation
occurs according to the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism with oxy-
gen removal from VOx species and simultaneous vanadium reduc-
tion. Rozanska et al. [16,35] indicated that propane oxidation on
vanadium surface species can occur by employing one vanadium
species or two neighboring vanadium species, which results in
V5+ reduction to V3+ or to V4+ ions, respectively. According to Kon-
dratenko et al. [34], the ODH process performed in the presence of
N2O on a catalyst composed of fully oxidized V2O5 brings about a
considerable reduction of the surface vanadium species, with V5+
presence at only ca. 18% after 1 h on stream. Considering the lim-
ited ability of N2O to reoxidize the reduced vanadium species,
one may suppose that reduction of surface vanadium species could
be responsible for the observed catalyst deactivation. However, the
role of the carbonaceous deposit cannot be excluded. To estimate
the possible role of the carbonaceous deposit in catalyst deactiva-
tion, an analysis of carbon present in the spent catalyst was con-
ducted. This analysis revealed a very small amount of carbon in
the spent catalyst, evaluated at 0.03%. This is consistent with IR
spectra (Fig. 3), pointing to a removal of organic species as a result
of evacuation at 673 K. Accordingly, it seems that carbonaceous
deposit formation may influence catalyst deactivation only slightly
and that the reduction of vanadium species is mainly responsible
for catalyst deactivation. Regeneration of the catalyst by heating
under N2O at 753 K partly restores the activity, and only reoxida-
tion in the presence of oxygen restores the initial activity
(Fig. 4S, Supplementary Materials).
To discuss the probable reaction paths of hydrocarbon oxida-
tion, both propane and propene oxidation were conducted at dif-
ferent contact times (1, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.5 s). When propane
oxidation was performed at 673 K and for a contact time of less
than 2 s, only traces of products were recorded. This observation
is consistent with the IR spectra of a propane and N2O mixture con-
tacted with the catalyst surface at 673 K (Fig. 3), indicating only
traces of oxidation products. Therefore, the effect of contact time
on propane oxidation was estimated for the reaction temperature
equal to 703 K. Contact time influences both propane conversion
and selectivity to respective products. Prolongation of contact time
results in an increase in propane conversion as well as in the selec-
tivity to COx (Fig. 7). Selectivity toward propene slightly dimin-
ishes, while selectivity to oxygen-bearing compounds decreases
more markedly. Accordingly, the dependence of selectivity to pro-
pene and COx on propane conversion (Fig. 5S, Supplementary
Materials) allows conclusions to be drawn as regards the paths of
COx and propene formation. Extrapolation of selectivity to COx to
zero propane conversion achieves a near-zero value, which indi-
cates that COx arises not only from propane but also from consec-
utive propene oxidation.
Propene formed from propane ODH undergoes further transfor-
mation to oxygen-bearing products and its conversion increases
with time on stream (Fig. 8). This may be explained by considering
the lessening (with time on stream) amount of propene formed
from propane in the ODH reaction. Selectivity to oxygenates plot-
ted vs. propene conversion (Fig. 6S, Supplementary Materials)
increases slightly with increasing conversion, although the extrap-
olation of the selectivity of particular oxygenates to zero propene
conversion indicates that oxygenates (PO, PA, ACR, and ACT) are
primary products of propene formed from propane ODH. On the
basis of the aforementioned facts, one may conclude that propane
oxidation can result in propene and COx only, as indicated in
Scheme 1 (COx was considered as the final product that can be
formed from each reagent as a result of total oxidation).
3.4. Propene oxidation
To establish whether propane and propene oxidation result in
the formation of the same oxygen-bearing products, propene oxi-
dation was performed under the same conditions. The measure-
ments show that initial propane conversion is considerably
higher when compared to propene oxidation (Figs. 6 and 9). This
is consistent with the findings of Rozanska et al. [16] indicating
that the propane oxidation rate is 48 times higher on vanadyl spe-
cies than the propene oxidation rate under the same conditions. As

mentioned above, the propane-to-propene transformation during
the ODH reaction proceeds according to the Marsvan Krevelen
oxidation mechanism, with oxygen removal from the catalyst
and, as a consequence, with vanadium ion reduction. On the other
hand, according to Duma and Hnicke [7], propene oxidation
occurs through the interaction with weakly electrophilic oxygen
generated by nitrous oxide adsorption on positively charged
cations without following vanadium reduction. Even though the
formation of electrophilic oxygen species as a result of the interac-
tion of cationic surface sites and adsorbed N2O was not decisively
proved, the adsorption of N2O on different cationic sites through
nitrogen was indicated by FT-IR spectra [36]. This adsorption
results in the formation of oxygen species of different charge,
which may stimulate mild oxidation. Hence, propene formed from
propane ODH may be mildly oxidized to propene oxide. However,
besides propene oxide, propionaldehyde and acetone have also
been indicated as products arising from propene interaction with
mildly electrophilic oxygen [7]. During propene oxidation, conver-
sion decreases slowly with time on stream, while selectivity to
oxygen-bearing compounds remains stable (Fig. 9). The isomeriza-
tion of PO toward propionaldehyde and acetone, in the presence of
acid sites, can also occur [37,38].
When the reaction was performed at 673 K, selectivity to pro-
pene oxide was ca. 20% and very near to selectivity to acetone,
while selectivity to propionaldehyde was clearly higher (Fig. 9A).
Propene conversion decreased slowly with time on stream, while
selectivity toward particular products did not change. An increase

in reaction temperature resulted in an increase in propene conver-
sion and also in a slight increase in selectivity to ACT and PA.
Simultaneously, selectivity to PO diminished (Fig. 9B).
Prolongation of contact time resulted in a propene conversion
increase with a small increase in total oxidation and a distinct
decrease in selectivity to acrolein (Fig. 10). The dependence of
selectivity to particular products on propene conversion presented
in Fig. 7S (Supplementary Materials) offers some insight into the
probable reaction paths. On the basis of the plots presented in
Fig. 7S, one may conclude that selectivity to propene oxide (PO)
and acetone (ACT) hardly changes with propene conversion, and
after extrapolation of propene conversion to zero the selectivities
are 0.17 and 0.27, respectively. This allows us to conclude that both
PO and ACT are primary products of propene oxidation. Selectivity
to propionaldehyde (PA) slightly increases with propene conver-
sion increase. Extrapolation of selectivity to PA to zero propene
conversion results in a very low value (about 0.05), strongly sug-
gesting that PA is formed not only directly from propene but also
from PO isomerization. The presence of weak acid centers on vana-
dium catalysts supported on silica has been revealed through their
activity for propan-2-ol dehydration (Fig. 8S, Supplementary Mate-
rials). The above conclusions made it possible to indicate in
Scheme 1 both the possible paths of propene oxidation directly
to PO, PA, and ACT and the further transformations of the primary
products (PO isomerization to PA and possible total oxidation).
Selectivity to COx is generally low and barely changes with pro-
pene conversion, so direct propene oxidation appears to be the
main source of COx, while consecutive oxidation of oxygenates
seems negligible.
The contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation products
decreases with prolongation of contact time. Acrolein and the
other allylic compounds are formed according to the Marsvan
Krevelen mechanism with hydrogen abstraction [39], and these
compounds can easily undergo further transformations. On the
basis of IR spectra recorded for a propene and N2O mixture con-
tacted with the 5V/SBA-3 catalyst surface, bands characteristic of
carboxylate species formation (at about 1690 and 1550 cm1) have
already appeared at 573 K. These bands became stronger at 673 K
and were not removed after evacuation at RT, and even evacuation
at 673 K failed to remove them completely. This may indicate a
transformation of the compounds of allylic nature toward carbona-
ceous deposits, which may be responsible for catalyst deactivation.
The decrease in the contribution of acrolein to propene oxidation
products with a prolongation of contact time supports this expla-
nation (Fig. 10). A longer contact time results in an elongated time
of interaction of formed acrolein with the surface centers, which
results in carbonaceous deposit formation. This may explain the
lower selectivity to acrolein. Formation of significant amounts of
carbonaceous deposit was confirmed by elemental analysis indi-
cating 1.8% of carbon in the catalyst after 1 h on stream.
4. Conclusions
This paper demonstrates propane oxidation to propene oxide on
vanadium-modified SBA-3 mesoporous silica, in the presence of
N2O as an oxidant. It was suggested that propene oxide formation
occurs from propene formed by a propane ODH reaction and not
directly from propane. Similarly, as in direct propene epoxidation,
apart from propene oxide, other oxygen- bearing products (propi-
onaldehyde, acetone, acrolein), as well as COx, were detected. On
the basis of catalytic measurements and in situ FTIR study, the
reaction paths of selective propane oxidation have been proposed.
It was found that propene oxide, acrolein, and acetone are mostly
primary products of propene oxidation, while propionaldehyde can
also originate from PO isomerization. These results are consistent
with the FTIR spectra of adsorbed PO, indicating the isomerization
of propene oxide to oxygenates, especially at higher temperature.
It was also found that the rapid deactivation of the 5V/SBA-3 cata-
lyst in propane oxidation is more due to the reduction of vanadium
than to carbonaceous deposits.
