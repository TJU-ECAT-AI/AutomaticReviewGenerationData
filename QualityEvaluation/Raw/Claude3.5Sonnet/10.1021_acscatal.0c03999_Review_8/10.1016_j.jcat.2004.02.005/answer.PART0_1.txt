[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation. In this case, development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows promise as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. The study demonstrates that steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA structures, are efficient catalysts for this process, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. These yields are comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2 as an oxidant, but with significantly higher space velocities, indicating superior performance of N2O-ODHP over Fe-zeolites.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Different zeolite structures show varying degrees of deactivation:

1. BEA framework catalysts (ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA) experience rapid and complete deactivation due to their large cavities with small apertures, which trap coke precursors and block active sites.

2. MFI framework catalysts (ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite) show better resistance to deactivation, with ex-FeZSM-5 performing particularly well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies can be proposed:

1. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions that high initial activity can be recovered by regenerating coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K. Optimizing this regeneration process could help maintain catalyst performance over longer periods.

2. Mesopore development: Creating mesopores in zeolites, such as through desilication in alkaline medium, could improve transport properties and active site accessibility. This approach has shown promise in ex-FeZSM-5, where mesopores formed by dealumination during steam treatment contribute to reduced pore blocking and slower deactivation.

3. Zeolite structure optimization: Further research into zeolite structures that balance high activity with resistance to deactivation could lead to more stable catalysts. The study shows that MFI frameworks perform better than BEA in this regard, suggesting that focusing on similar structures might be beneficial.

4. Iron species distribution: Investigating the optimal distribution and nature of iron species in the zeolite framework could lead to catalysts with improved activity and stability.

5. Process optimization: Exploring different reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, might help minimize coke formation while maintaining high propylene yields.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable and sustainable process for propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出了良好的前景，因为它能够实现高丙烯选择性。研究表明，蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石，特别是MFI和BEA结构，是这一过程的高效催化剂，在723 K下可实现高达25%的丙烯收率。这些收率与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进催化剂相当，但空速显著更高，表明N2O-ODHP在Fe-沸石上的性能优越。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活。不同的沸石结构显示出不同程度的失活：

1. BEA框架催化剂（ex-FeBEA和ex-H-BEA）由于其具有小孔径的大腔体结构，会迅速完全失活，这些结构会捕获积碳前体并阻塞活性位点。

2. MFI框架催化剂（ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite）表现出更好的抗失活能力，其中ex-FeZSM-5的表现尤为出色。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂再生：研究提到，在773 K下用氧气再生积碳的沸石可以恢复高初始活性。优化这个再生过程可以帮助维持催化剂长期性能。

2. 介孔发展：通过碱性介质脱硅等方法在沸石中创建介孔，可以改善传输性能和活性位点可及性。这种方法在ex-FeZSM-5中表现出潜力，其中蒸汽处理过程中由脱铝形成的介孔有助于减少孔道阻塞和减缓失活。

3. 沸石结构优化：进一步研究能够平衡高活性和抗失活能力的沸石结构可能会导致更稳定的催化剂。研究表明，MFI框架在这方面的表现优于BEA，这意味着关注类似结构可能会有益。

4. 铁物种分布：研究沸石框架中铁物种的最佳分布和性质可能会导致活性和稳定性更好的催化剂。

5. 工艺优化：探索不同的反应条件，如温度、压力和反应物比例，可能有助于在保持高丙烯收率的同时最小化积碳形成。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能会成为一个更可行和可持续的丙烯生产过程。
