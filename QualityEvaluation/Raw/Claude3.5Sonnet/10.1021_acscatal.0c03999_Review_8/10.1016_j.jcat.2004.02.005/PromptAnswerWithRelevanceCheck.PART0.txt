The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O-mediated ODHP using steam-activated Fe-zeolites can achieve propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, which is comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. Moreover, the space velocity in N2O-ODHP experiments is an order of magnitude higher than typically applied in literature, indicating the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) showing efficient catalytic performance. Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide. The nature of the zeolite host affects the catalyst's performance, with FeZSM-5 showing remarkable resistance against deactivation compared to FeBEA.

The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP are primarily related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Coke formation is a major drawback, causing physical blocking of the active reaction sites inside the zeolitic pore system and resulting in decreased propylene yield. The deactivation behavior strongly differs among catalysts, with some showing rapid and complete deactivation (e.g., FeBEA) while others demonstrate more resistance (e.g., FeZSM-5).

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Further research into the nature and distribution of extraframework iron species could lead to more stable and active catalysts.

2. Zeolite structure modification: Developing zeolites with improved pore structures and transport properties, such as introducing mesopores, could enhance catalyst stability and reduce coking.

3. Regeneration techniques: Improving and optimizing regeneration methods, such as the observed recovery of activity after regeneration in oxygen at 773 K, could extend catalyst lifetime.

4. Advanced characterization: Utilizing techniques like TEOM for simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking can provide valuable insights for catalyst design and process optimization.

5. Exploration of other zeolite hosts: Investigating zeolites with different topologies and pore architectures may lead to catalysts with improved performance and stability.

6. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: Deeper investigation into the relationship between N2O decomposition activity and resistance to coke deactivation could inform catalyst development.

7. Process engineering: Developing innovative reactor designs or process configurations that minimize coking or allow for continuous catalyst regeneration could improve the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a practical and efficient process for propylene production could be significantly enhanced.

一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势。使用蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石作为催化剂的N2O介导ODHP在723 K下可以达到25%的丙烯产率，这与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进催化剂相当。此外，N2O-ODHP实验中的空速比文献中通常应用的高出一个数量级，表明蒸汽活化的铁沸石具有显著的性能。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石(MFI和BEA)显示出高效的催化性能。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的骨架外铁物种负责一氧化二氮与丙烷的氧化脱氢。沸石宿主的性质影响催化剂的性能，FeZSM-5与FeBEA相比表现出显著的抗失活能力。

N2O-ODHP面临的主要挑战与催化剂失活和稳定性有关。焦炭形成是一个主要缺点，导致沸石孔系统内活性反应位点的物理阻塞，从而降低丙烯产率。不同催化剂的失活行为差异很大，有些催化剂（如FeBEA）表现出快速和完全失活，而其他催化剂（如FeZSM-5）则表现出更强的抗性。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：进一步研究骨架外铁物种的性质和分布，可能会导致更稳定和活性的催化剂。

2. 沸石结构改性：开发具有改进孔结构和传输性能的沸石，如引入介孔，可以提高催化剂稳定性并减少焦炭形成。

3. 再生技术：改进和优化再生方法，如观察到在773 K下氧气再生后活性恢复，可以延长催化剂寿命。

4. 先进表征：利用TEOM等技术同时测量反应和焦炭形成，可为催化剂设计和过程优化提供宝贵见解。

5. 探索其他沸石宿主：研究具有不同拓扑结构和孔道结构的沸石可能会导致性能和稳定性更好的催化剂。

6. 理解失活机理：深入研究N2O分解活性与抗焦炭失活之间的关系，可以为催化剂开发提供信息。

7. 过程工程：开发创新的反应器设计或过程配置，以最小化焦炭形成或允许连续催化剂再生，可以提高N2O-ODHP的整体可行性。

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows promise as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve high propylene selectivity. The study demonstrates that steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA structures, are efficient catalysts for this process, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. These yields are comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2 as an oxidant, but with significantly higher space velocities, indicating superior performance of N2O-ODHP over Fe-zeolites.

However, the critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Different zeolite structures show varying degrees of deactivation:

1. BEA framework catalysts (ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA) experience rapid and complete deactivation due to their large cavities with small apertures, which trap coke precursors and block active sites.

2. MFI framework catalysts (ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite) show better resistance to deactivation, with ex-FeZSM-5 performing particularly well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies can be proposed:

1. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions that high initial activity can be recovered by regenerating coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K. Optimizing this regeneration process could help maintain catalyst performance over longer periods.

2. Mesopore development: Creating mesopores in zeolites, such as through desilication in alkaline medium, could improve transport properties and active site accessibility. This approach has shown promise in ex-FeZSM-5, where mesopores formed by dealumination during steam treatment contribute to reduced pore blocking and slower deactivation.

3. Zeolite structure optimization: Further research into zeolite structures that balance high activity with resistance to deactivation could lead to more stable catalysts. The study shows that MFI frameworks perform better than BEA in this regard, suggesting that focusing on similar structures might be beneficial.

4. Iron species distribution: Investigating the optimal distribution and nature of iron species in the zeolite framework could lead to catalysts with improved activity and stability.

5. Process optimization: Exploring different reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios, might help minimize coke formation while maintaining high propylene yields.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable and sustainable process for propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出了良好的前景，因为它能够实现高丙烯选择性。研究表明，蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石，特别是MFI和BEA结构，是这一过程的高效催化剂，在723 K下可实现高达25%的丙烯收率。这些收率与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进催化剂相当，但空速显著更高，表明N2O-ODHP在Fe-沸石上的性能优越。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活。不同的沸石结构显示出不同程度的失活：

1. BEA框架催化剂（ex-FeBEA和ex-H-BEA）由于其具有小孔径的大腔体结构，会迅速完全失活，这些结构会捕获积碳前体并阻塞活性位点。

2. MFI框架催化剂（ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite）表现出更好的抗失活能力，其中ex-FeZSM-5的表现尤为出色。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂再生：研究提到，在773 K下用氧气再生积碳的沸石可以恢复高初始活性。优化这个再生过程可以帮助维持催化剂长期性能。

2. 介孔发展：通过碱性介质脱硅等方法在沸石中创建介孔，可以改善传输性能和活性位点可及性。这种方法在ex-FeZSM-5中表现出潜力，其中蒸汽处理过程中由脱铝形成的介孔有助于减少孔道阻塞和减缓失活。

3. 沸石结构优化：进一步研究能够平衡高活性和抗失活能力的沸石结构可能会导致更稳定的催化剂。研究表明，MFI框架在这方面的表现优于BEA，这意味着关注类似结构可能会有益。

4. 铁物种分布：研究沸石框架中铁物种的最佳分布和性质可能会导致活性和稳定性更好的催化剂。

5. 工艺优化：探索不同的反应条件，如温度、压力和反应物比例，可能有助于在保持高丙烯收率的同时最小化积碳形成。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能会成为一个更可行和可持续的丙烯生产过程。

N2O shows promising performance as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), offering high propylene selectivity comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA structures, demonstrate excellent catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K with significantly higher space velocities than typically reported.

The main advantages of using N2O in ODHP include:
1. High propylene yields and selectivity
2. Ability to operate at higher space velocities
3. Potential for simultaneous valorization of propane and mitigation of N2O as a greenhouse gas

However, the critical challenge in N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Different catalysts exhibit varying degrees of deactivation:

1. Fe-BEA zeolites show rapid and complete deactivation due to large cavities that trap coke precursors.
2. Fe-ZSM-5 (MFI structure) demonstrates better resistance to deactivation, likely due to its channel structure and absence of large cages.
3. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 shows the best performance against deactivation, possibly due to the presence of mesopores that improve transport properties and reduce pore blocking.

To address these limitations and improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP, several strategies can be proposed:

1. Catalyst design: Focus on developing zeolite structures with optimal pore sizes and distributions to minimize coke formation and improve stability.
2. Mesopore introduction: Explore methods like desilication to create mesopores in zeolites, enhancing transport properties and active site accessibility.
3. Bimetallic catalysts: Investigate the use of bimetallic systems to potentially improve both activity and stability.
4. Regeneration strategies: Optimize regeneration processes to efficiently remove coke and restore catalyst activity.
5. Reaction engineering: Explore innovative reactor designs or operating conditions to minimize coke formation and extend catalyst lifetime.
6. In-situ characterization: Utilize advanced characterization techniques to better understand the deactivation mechanism and guide catalyst improvement.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for practical implementation in propylene production.
