[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "As concluded above, the initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is similar, but the deactivation behavior strongly differs."

[5] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."

[6] "Development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows promise as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve high propylene yields. The study demonstrates that steam-activated Fe-zeolites can achieve propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K using N2O as an oxidant, which is comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2. Moreover, the space velocity in these experiments is an order of magnitude higher than typically reported, indicating superior performance of steamed iron zeolites in N2O-ODHP.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, primarily focusing on steam-activated Fe-zeolites with different structures such as MFI (FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite) and BEA (FeBEA). The study also compares these synthesized catalysts with commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA zeolites containing trace amounts of iron.

The critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. While the initial performance of different steam-activated iron zeolites is similar, their deactivation behavior varies significantly. The rapid deactivation observed in FeBEA is attributed to its framework structure, which contains large cavities with small apertures that can trap coke precursors and block access to active sites.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies can be proposed:

1. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions that high initial activity can be recovered by regenerating coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K. Developing efficient regeneration protocols could extend catalyst lifetime.

2. Optimizing zeolite structure: The MFI framework shows better resistance to deactivation compared to BEA. Further research into zeolite structures that minimize coke trapping while maintaining high activity could lead to more stable catalysts.

3. Mesopore development: Creating mesopores in the zeolites, for example through desilication in alkaline medium, could improve transport properties and active site accessibility, potentially reducing coke formation and improving catalyst stability.

4. Tuning extraframework iron species: The study suggests that the nature and distribution of extraframework iron species influence deactivation behavior. Further research into optimizing these species could lead to more stable catalysts.

5. Exploring other zeolite types: While the study focused on MFI and BEA structures, investigating other zeolite types might reveal frameworks with better stability and performance in N2O-ODHP.

6. Combining N2O with other oxidants: Exploring the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants like O2 might lead to synergistic effects that improve catalyst stability or performance.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for practical implementation in propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂显示出前景，因为它能够实现高丙烯产率。研究表明，使用N2O作为氧化剂，蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石在723 K下可以达到高达25%的丙烯产率，这与使用O2的最先进催化剂相当。此外，这些实验中的空速比通常报道的高一个数量级，表明蒸汽处理的铁沸石在N2O-ODHP中表现优异。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，主要集中在具有不同结构的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石上，如MFI（FeZSM-5和Fe-硅石）和BEA（FeBEA）。该研究还将这些合成的催化剂与含有微量铁的商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA沸石进行了比较。

N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战是由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活。虽然不同蒸汽活化铁沸石的初始性能相似，但它们的失活行为差异显著。在FeBEA中观察到的快速失活被归因于其框架结构，其中包含具有小孔径的大腔体，可以捕获积碳前体并阻塞活性位点。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几种策略：

1. 催化剂再生：研究提到，通过在773 K下用氧气再生积碳的沸石可以恢复高初始活性。开发高效的再生方案可以延长催化剂寿命。

2. 优化沸石结构：MFI框架相比BEA表现出更好的抗失活能力。进一步研究能够最小化积碳捕获同时保持高活性的沸石结构可能会带来更稳定的催化剂。

3. 介孔开发：通过碱性介质脱硅等方法在沸石中创建介孔，可以改善传输性能和活性位点可及性，可能减少积碳形成并提高催化剂稳定性。

4. 调节骨架外铁物种：研究表明，骨架外铁物种的性质和分布影响失活行为。进一步研究优化这些物种可能会带来更稳定的催化剂。

5. 探索其他沸石类型：虽然研究集中在MFI和BEA结构上，但研究其他沸石类型可能会发现在N2O-ODHP中具有更好稳定性和性能的框架。

6. 将N2O与其他氧化剂结合：探索N2O与其他氧化剂（如O2）结合使用可能会产生协同效应，提高催化剂稳定性或性能。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能会成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际应用选择。
