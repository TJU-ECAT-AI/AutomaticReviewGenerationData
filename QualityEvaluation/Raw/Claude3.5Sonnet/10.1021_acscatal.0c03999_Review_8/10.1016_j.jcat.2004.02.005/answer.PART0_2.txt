[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels. Apparently, these trap cavities cause the entire blocking of the access to the active sites, leading to complete catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite [13,14]. The more open structure of FeZSM-5 may reduce pore blocking by coke and also to improve transport of reactants and products, slowing down deactivation."

N2O shows promising performance as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), offering high propylene selectivity comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly MFI and BEA structures, demonstrate excellent catalytic activity, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K with significantly higher space velocities than typically reported.

The main advantages of using N2O in ODHP include:
1. High propylene yields and selectivity
2. Ability to operate at higher space velocities
3. Potential for simultaneous valorization of propane and mitigation of N2O as a greenhouse gas

However, the critical challenge in N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Different catalysts exhibit varying degrees of deactivation:

1. Fe-BEA zeolites show rapid and complete deactivation due to large cavities that trap coke precursors.
2. Fe-ZSM-5 (MFI structure) demonstrates better resistance to deactivation, likely due to its channel structure and absence of large cages.
3. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 shows the best performance against deactivation, possibly due to the presence of mesopores that improve transport properties and reduce pore blocking.

To address these limitations and improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP, several strategies can be proposed:

1. Catalyst design: Focus on developing zeolite structures with optimal pore sizes and distributions to minimize coke formation and improve stability.
2. Mesopore introduction: Explore methods like desilication to create mesopores in zeolites, enhancing transport properties and active site accessibility.
3. Bimetallic catalysts: Investigate the use of bimetallic systems to potentially improve both activity and stability.
4. Regeneration strategies: Optimize regeneration processes to efficiently remove coke and restore catalyst activity.
5. Reaction engineering: Explore innovative reactor designs or operating conditions to minimize coke formation and extend catalyst lifetime.
6. In-situ characterization: Utilize advanced characterization techniques to better understand the deactivation mechanism and guide catalyst improvement.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for practical implementation in propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂显示出promising的性能，提供了与使用O2的最先进催化剂相当的高丙烯选择性。蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石，特别是MFI和BEA结构，表现出优异的催化活性，在723 K下丙烯产率高达25%，且空速显著高于通常报道的水平。

使用N2O进行ODHP的主要优势包括：
1. 高丙烯产率和选择性
2. 能够在更高的空速下操作
3. 潜在地同时实现丙烷的增值利用和N2O作为温室气体的减排

然而，N2O-ODHP的关键挑战是由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。不同的催化剂表现出不同程度的失活：

1. Fe-BEA沸石由于存在大孔穴而导致积碳前体物被捕获，显示出快速且完全的失活。
2. Fe-ZSM-5（MFI结构）对失活表现出更好的抗性，可能是由于其通道结构和缺乏大孔穴。
3. 蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5表现出最佳的抗失活性能，可能是由于介孔的存在改善了传输性质并减少了孔道堵塞。

为解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的可行性，可以提出以下几个策略：

1. 催化剂设计：专注于开发具有最佳孔径和分布的沸石结构，以最小化积碳形成并提高稳定性。
2. 介孔引入：探索如脱硅等方法在沸石中创造介孔，增强传输性质和活性位点可及性。
3. 双金属催化剂：研究双金属系统的使用，以潜在地提高活性和稳定性。
4. 再生策略：优化再生过程，以有效去除积碳并恢复催化剂活性。
5. 反应工程：探索创新的反应器设计或操作条件，以最小化积碳形成并延长催化剂寿命。
6. 原位表征：利用先进的表征技术更好地理解失活机理，指导催化剂改进。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际应用选择。
