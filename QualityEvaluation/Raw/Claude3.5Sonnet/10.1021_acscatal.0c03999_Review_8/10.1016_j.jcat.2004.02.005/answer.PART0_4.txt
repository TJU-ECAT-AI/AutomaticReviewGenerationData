[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K"

[4] "The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

[5] "Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[6] "The rapid deactivation observed in ex-FeBEA and ex-H-BEA can be connected to the presence of large cavities with relatively small apertures in the BEA framework, especially at the intersection of the channels."

[7] "Development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium, can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows promise as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its ability to achieve high propylene yields. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as an oxidant can achieve propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, which is comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2 as an oxidant.

The main catalysts employed in this process are steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly those with MFI and BEA frameworks. These catalysts contain extraframework iron species generated during steam treatment, which are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with N2O.

The critical challenge associated with N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This deactivation process varies depending on the zeolite structure, with BEA frameworks showing rapid deactivation due to their large cavities with small apertures, while MFI frameworks demonstrate slower deactivation rates.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies can be proposed:

1. Catalyst regeneration: The high initial activity can be recovered by regenerating coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K.

2. Improved monitoring: Utilizing techniques like TEOM for simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking to better understand and control the deactivation process.

3. Zeolite structure modification: Developing mesopores in the zeolites, for example by desilication in alkaline medium, to improve transport properties and active site accessibility.

4. Optimizing iron species distribution: Further research into the nature and distribution of extraframework iron species to enhance catalytic performance and stability.

5. Exploring new zeolite frameworks: Investigating other zeolite structures that may offer a balance between high activity and resistance to deactivation.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial application.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂显示出良好的前景，因为它能够实现高丙烯产率。使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石在723 K下可以达到高达25%的丙烯产率，这与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进催化剂相当。

这个过程中使用的主要催化剂是蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石，特别是具有MFI和BEA骨架的沸石。这些催化剂含有在蒸汽处理过程中生成的骨架外铁物种，这些物种负责N2O与丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。

N2O-ODHP面临的主要挑战是由于积碳导致的催化剂失活。这种失活过程因沸石结构而异，BEA骨架由于其具有小孔径的大腔体而表现出快速失活，而MFI骨架则表现出较慢的失活速率。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂再生：通过在773 K下用氧气再生积碳的沸石可以恢复其高初始活性。

2. 改进监测：利用TEOM等技术同时测量反应和积碳，以更好地理解和控制失活过程。

3. 沸石结构改性：通过碱性介质脱硅等方法在沸石中发展介孔，以改善传输性能和活性位点可及性。

4. 优化铁物种分布：进一步研究骨架外铁物种的性质和分布，以提高催化性能和稳定性。

5. 探索新的沸石骨架：研究其他可能在高活性和抗失活性之间取得平衡的沸石结构。

这些研究方向有可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
