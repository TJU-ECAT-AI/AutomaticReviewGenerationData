[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants. N2O-mediated ODHP using steam-activated Fe-zeolites can achieve propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, which is comparable to state-of-the-art catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. Moreover, the space velocity in N2O-ODHP experiments is an order of magnitude higher than typically applied in literature, indicating the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, with steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) showing efficient catalytic performance. Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide. The nature of the zeolite host affects the catalyst's performance, with FeZSM-5 showing remarkable resistance against deactivation compared to FeBEA.

The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP are primarily related to catalyst deactivation and stability. Coke formation is a major drawback, causing physical blocking of the active reaction sites inside the zeolitic pore system and resulting in decreased propylene yield. The deactivation behavior strongly differs among catalysts, with some showing rapid and complete deactivation (e.g., FeBEA) while others demonstrate more resistance (e.g., FeZSM-5).

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Further research into the nature and distribution of extraframework iron species could lead to more stable and active catalysts.

2. Zeolite structure modification: Developing zeolites with improved pore structures and transport properties, such as introducing mesopores, could enhance catalyst stability and reduce coking.

3. Regeneration techniques: Improving and optimizing regeneration methods, such as the observed recovery of activity after regeneration in oxygen at 773 K, could extend catalyst lifetime.

4. Advanced characterization: Utilizing techniques like TEOM for simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking can provide valuable insights for catalyst design and process optimization.

5. Exploration of other zeolite hosts: Investigating zeolites with different topologies and pore architectures may lead to catalysts with improved performance and stability.

6. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: Deeper investigation into the relationship between N2O decomposition activity and resistance to coke deactivation could inform catalyst development.

7. Process engineering: Developing innovative reactor designs or process configurations that minimize coking or allow for continuous catalyst regeneration could improve the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the potential of N2O-ODHP as a practical and efficient process for propylene production could be significantly enhanced.

一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势。使用蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石作为催化剂的N2O介导ODHP在723 K下可以达到25%的丙烯产率，这与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进催化剂相当。此外，N2O-ODHP实验中的空速比文献中通常应用的高出一个数量级，表明蒸汽活化的铁沸石具有显著的性能。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石(MFI和BEA)显示出高效的催化性能。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的骨架外铁物种负责一氧化二氮与丙烷的氧化脱氢。沸石宿主的性质影响催化剂的性能，FeZSM-5与FeBEA相比表现出显著的抗失活能力。

N2O-ODHP面临的主要挑战与催化剂失活和稳定性有关。焦炭形成是一个主要缺点，导致沸石孔系统内活性反应位点的物理阻塞，从而降低丙烯产率。不同催化剂的失活行为差异很大，有些催化剂（如FeBEA）表现出快速和完全失活，而其他催化剂（如FeZSM-5）则表现出更强的抗性。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：进一步研究骨架外铁物种的性质和分布，可能会导致更稳定和活性的催化剂。

2. 沸石结构改性：开发具有改进孔结构和传输性能的沸石，如引入介孔，可以提高催化剂稳定性并减少焦炭形成。

3. 再生技术：改进和优化再生方法，如观察到在773 K下氧气再生后活性恢复，可以延长催化剂寿命。

4. 先进表征：利用TEOM等技术同时测量反应和焦炭形成，可为催化剂设计和过程优化提供宝贵见解。

5. 探索其他沸石宿主：研究具有不同拓扑结构和孔道结构的沸石可能会导致性能和稳定性更好的催化剂。

6. 理解失活机理：深入研究N2O分解活性与抗焦炭失活之间的关系，可以为催化剂开发提供信息。

7. 过程工程：开发创新的反应器设计或过程配置，以最小化焦炭形成或允许连续催化剂再生，可以提高N2O-ODHP的整体可行性。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP作为丙烯生产的实用高效过程的潜力可能会显著提高。
