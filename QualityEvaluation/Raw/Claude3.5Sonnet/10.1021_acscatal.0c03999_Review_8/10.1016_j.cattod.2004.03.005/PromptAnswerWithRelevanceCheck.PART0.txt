[1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "Taking these results into account, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."

[3] "These results support the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase, which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O increases the selectivity to propylene while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as the yield of CO2. This suggests that N2O promotes the formation of the desired product (propylene) while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

2. Promotion of catalyst reduction: N2O facilitates the reduction of molybdenum on the catalyst surface. This reduced state of the catalyst is associated with higher selectivity for propylene formation.

3. Inhibition of oxygen adsorption: N2O is thought to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface (e.g., NiMoO4), which promotes a more reduced state of the catalyst and contributes to improved selectivity.

4. Tunable oxidation state: The addition of N2O as a gas dope in the feed allows for adjusting the oxidation state of the catalyst surface atoms, which is crucial for optimizing selectivity.

Various catalysts employed in this process include:

1. NiMoO4: Used as a base catalyst for ODHP.
2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4 mixture: The addition of α-Sb2O4 to NiMoO4 helps control selectivity by inhibiting non-selective sites.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability:

1. Surface area reduction: The specific surface area of NiMoO4 decreases significantly after catalytic reactions, which may lead to reduced catalyst activity over time.

2. Oxidation state control: Maintaining the optimal reduced state of the catalyst surface during prolonged operation may be challenging.

3. Potential carbon deposition: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, carbon deposition is a common issue in ODHP processes and could lead to catalyst deactivation.

Strategies or research directions to address these limitations:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved stability and resistance to surface area reduction, possibly through the use of support materials or promoters that maintain high dispersion of active sites.

2. In-situ regeneration: Investigate methods for periodic regeneration of the catalyst to restore its optimal oxidation state and remove any deposited carbon.

3. Optimize N2O concentration: Conduct further studies to determine the optimal N2O concentration in the feed gas to balance selectivity improvement with catalyst stability.

4. Explore synergistic effects: Investigate the combined use of N2O with other gas dopes or catalyst additives to enhance both selectivity and stability.

5. Advanced characterization techniques: Utilize in-situ or operando spectroscopic methods to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state during the reaction.

6. Kinetic and mechanistic studies: Conduct detailed kinetic and mechanistic investigations to elucidate the exact role of N2O in the reaction and its interaction with the catalyst surface.

7. Process engineering: Explore reactor designs or operating conditions that can help maintain the optimal catalyst state while using N2O as an oxidant.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible option for practical implementation in the production of propylene.

2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4混合物：这些复杂的双相催化剂即使在没有N2O的情况下也表现出增强的选择性，但添加N2O后会进一步改善。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 表面积减少：无论是否存在N2O，NiMoO4催化剂的比表面积在反应后都会显著降低。

2. 维持最佳氧化态：平衡N2O促进的还原与催化剂再氧化的需求对长期稳定性和活性至关重要。

3. 潜在的不良副产物形成：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但含氧产物或积碳的形成可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具实际应用可行性，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂设计：开发能在N2O存在的反应条件下保持表面积和最佳氧化态的催化剂。

2. 精细调节N2O浓度：研究反应物料中的最佳N2O浓度，以平衡选择性改善和催化剂稳定性。

3. 探索替代载体材料：研究不同载体材料的效果，以增强活性相的稳定性，同时保持N2O添加的优势。

4. 原位再生技术：开发周期性催化剂再生方法，无需停止反应器运行。

5. 机理研究：对N2O促进选择性和催化剂还原的确切机理进行详细研究，以指导更好的催化剂设计。

6. 与其他促进剂组合：探索将N2O与其他气相或固态促进剂结合使用的协同效应，以进一步提高性能和稳定性。

7. 工艺工程改进：研究能够减轻催化剂失活的反应器设计和操作条件，同时最大化N2O作为氧化剂的优势。
