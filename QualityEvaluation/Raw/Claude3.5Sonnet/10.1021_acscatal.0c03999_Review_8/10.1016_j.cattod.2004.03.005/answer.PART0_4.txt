[1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "N2O inhibits such oxidation, promoting the reduction to Mo5+. CO2 increases conversion and, thus, favours non selectivity; on the contrary, N2O decreases conversion and increases selectivity."

[3] "Taking these results into account, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."

[4] "These results support the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase, which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O increases the selectivity to propylene while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as the yield of CO2.

2. Promotion of catalyst reduction: N2O facilitates the reduction of molybdenum on the catalyst surface, promoting the formation of Mo5+ species. This reduced state of the catalyst is associated with higher selectivity.

3. Inhibition of over-oxidation: N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface, which helps prevent over-oxidation of propane and propylene, leading to improved selectivity.

4. Tuning of catalyst oxidation state: The addition of N2O as a gas dope in the feed allows for precise control of the catalyst's oxidation state, which is crucial for optimizing selectivity.

The catalysts employed in this process include:

1. NiMoO4: Pure nickel molybdate catalysts show improved selectivity when N2O is added to the feed.

2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4 mixtures: These complex biphasic catalysts demonstrate enhanced selectivity even without N2O, but further improvements are observed with N2O addition.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Surface area reduction: The specific surface area of NiMoO4 catalysts decreases significantly after reaction, regardless of N2O presence.

2. Maintaining optimal oxidation state: Balancing the reduction promoted by N2O with the need for catalyst reoxidation is crucial for long-term stability and activity.

3. Potential formation of undesired byproducts: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, the formation of oxygenated products or coke could lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain their surface area and optimal oxidation state under reaction conditions with N2O.

2. Fine-tuning N2O concentration: Investigate the optimal N2O concentration in the feed to balance selectivity improvements with catalyst stability.

3. Exploration of alternative support materials: Study the effects of different support materials that could enhance the stability of the active phase while maintaining the benefits of N2O addition.

4. In-situ regeneration techniques: Develop methods for periodic catalyst regeneration without requiring reactor shutdown.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct detailed investigations into the exact mechanism by which N2O promotes selectivity and catalyst reduction to inform better catalyst design.

6. Combination with other promoters: Explore the synergistic effects of combining N2O with other gas-phase or solid-state promoters to further enhance performance and stability.

7. Process engineering improvements: Investigate reactor designs and operating conditions that could mitigate catalyst deactivation while maximizing the benefits of N2O as an oxidant.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 提高选择性：N2O增加了丙烯的选择性，同时降低了丙烷和氧气的转化率以及二氧化碳的产率。

2. 促进催化剂还原：N2O促进催化剂表面钼的还原，有利于Mo5+物种的形成。这种催化剂的还原状态与更高的选择性相关。

3. 抑制过度氧化：N2O抑制氧气在催化剂表面的吸附，有助于防止丙烷和丙烯的过度氧化，从而提高选择性。

4. 调节催化剂氧化态：将N2O作为气体掺杂剂添加到反应物料中，可以精确控制催化剂的氧化态，这对优化选择性至关重要。

该过程中使用的催化剂包括：

1. NiMoO4：纯镍钼酸盐催化剂在添加N2O后显示出改善的选择性。

2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4混合物：这些复杂的双相催化剂即使在没有N2O的情况下也表现出增强的选择性，但添加N2O后会进一步改善。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 表面积减少：无论是否存在N2O，NiMoO4催化剂的比表面积在反应后都会显著降低。

2. 维持最佳氧化态：平衡N2O促进的还原与催化剂再氧化的需求对长期稳定性和活性至关重要。

3. 潜在的不良副产物形成：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但含氧产物或积碳的形成可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具实际应用可行性，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂设计：开发能在N2O存在的反应条件下保持表面积和最佳氧化态的催化剂。

2. 精细调节N2O浓度：研究反应物料中的最佳N2O浓度，以平衡选择性改善和催化剂稳定性。

3. 探索替代载体材料：研究不同载体材料的效果，以增强活性相的稳定性，同时保持N2O添加的优势。
