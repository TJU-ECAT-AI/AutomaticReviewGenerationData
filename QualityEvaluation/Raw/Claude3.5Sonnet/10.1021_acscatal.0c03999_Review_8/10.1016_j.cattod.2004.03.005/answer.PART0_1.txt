[1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "N2O inhibits such oxidation, promoting the reduction to Mo5+. CO2 increases conversion and, thus, favours non selectivity; on the contrary, N2O decreases conversion and increases selectivity."

[3] "When compared with the mixture of NiMoO4 + -Sb2O4 tested in the absence of dope, addition of 300 ppm N2O in the feed induces: (i) a weak decrease in the conversion of propane (13%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of CO2 (22%) and (iii) a decrease in the conversion of oxygen (21%)."

[4] "Under N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."

[5] "We have suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the oxidation rate of the catalysts [3,4]. This would account for the decrease in propane conversion, in O2 consumption and in the yield in CO2 observed in the mixture."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O promotes higher selectivity to propylene while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as reducing CO2 yield.

2. Promotion of catalyst reduction: N2O facilitates the reduction of molybdenum in catalysts like NiMoO4, leading to a more selective catalytic surface.

3. Inhibition of over-oxidation: By inhibiting O2 adsorption, N2O limits the oxidation rate of catalysts, which helps prevent the complete oxidation of propane to CO2.

The catalysts employed in this process include:

1. NiMoO4
2. Mixture of NiMoO4 and α-Sb2O4

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability:

1. Surface area reduction: The specific area of NiMoO4 drops significantly after catalytic reactions, which may impact long-term stability.

2. Oxidation state control: Maintaining the optimal oxidation state of molybdenum (slightly reduced) is crucial for selectivity but may be challenging over extended periods.

Strategies to address limitations and improve feasibility:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain their reduced state and surface area over longer periods, possibly by incorporating stabilizing elements or structures.

2. Optimizing N2O concentration: Fine-tune the amount of N2O in the feed to balance selectivity and conversion.

3. Mixed oxidant approach: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to optimize both selectivity and conversion.

4. Process engineering: Develop reactor designs that allow for controlled introduction of N2O at different stages of the reaction to maintain optimal catalyst oxidation states.

5. In-situ regeneration: Explore methods to regenerate the catalyst without removing it from the reactor, potentially using periodic pulses of different gas compositions.

6. Advanced characterization: Utilize operando spectroscopy techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state during the reaction, informing further improvements.

These strategies could potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation by addressing the key challenges of catalyst stability and optimizing the balance between selectivity and conversion.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 提高选择性：N2O提高了丙烯的选择性，同时降低了丙烷和氧气的转化率，并减少了CO2的产率。

2. 促进催化剂还原：N2O促进了NiMoO4等催化剂中钼的还原，形成更具选择性的催化表面。

3. 抑制过度氧化：通过抑制O2的吸附，N2O限制了催化剂的氧化速率，有助于防止丙烷完全氧化成CO2。

这一过程中使用的催化剂包括：

1. NiMoO4
2. NiMoO4和α-Sb2O4的混合物

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战：

1. 表面积减少：NiMoO4的比表面积在催化反应后显著下降，可能影响长期稳定性。

2. 氧化态控制：保持钼的最佳氧化态（略微还原）对选择性至关重要，但在长期运行中可能具有挑战性。

解决限制和提高可行性的策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发能够长期保持还原状态和表面积的催化剂，可能通过引入稳定元素或结构。

2. 优化N2O浓度：精细调节进料中N2O的量，以平衡选择性和转化率。

3. 混合氧化剂方法：研究N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用，以优化选择性和转化率。

4. 工艺工程：开发允许在反应不同阶段控制引入N2O的反应器设计，以维持最佳催化剂氧化态。

5. 原位再生：探索无需从反应器中移除催化剂的再生方法，可能使用不同气体组成的周期性脉冲。

6. 先进表征：利用原位光谱技术更好地理解反应过程中催化剂结构和氧化态的动态变化，为进一步改进提供信息。

这些策略可能通过解决催化剂稳定性的关键挑战并优化选择性和转化率之间的平衡，使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际应用选择。
