[1] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."

[2] "Taking these results into account, it could be suggested that the role of N2O could be the same. N2O also facilitates the reduction of the surface of the molybdenum. But the mechanism by which the reduction of the catalysts is adjusted seems to be different. It could be suggested that N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen on NiMoO4, so promoting reduction."

[3] "These results support the fact that a more reduced oxidation state of atoms at the surface of the catalysts could increase selectivity and that this state could be obtained by adding an oxide phase, which produces spillover oxygen or by adding N2O as gas dope in the feed."

[4] "The adjustment of the concentrations of N2O and CO2 thus clearly appears as a promising tool to modify the number of selective sites, to improve selectivity of partial oxidation products and to improve combustion of methane."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O increases the selectivity to propylene while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, as well as the yield of CO2. This suggests that N2O promotes the formation of the desired product (propylene) while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

2. Promotion of catalyst reduction: N2O facilitates the reduction of molybdenum on the catalyst surface. This reduced state of the catalyst is associated with higher selectivity for propylene formation.

3. Inhibition of oxygen adsorption: N2O is thought to inhibit the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface (e.g., NiMoO4), which promotes a more reduced state of the catalyst and contributes to improved selectivity.

4. Tunable oxidation state: The addition of N2O as a gas dope in the feed allows for adjusting the oxidation state of the catalyst surface atoms, which is crucial for optimizing selectivity.

Various catalysts employed in this process include:

1. NiMoO4: Used as a base catalyst for ODHP.
2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4 mixture: The addition of α-Sb2O4 to NiMoO4 helps control selectivity by inhibiting non-selective sites.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability:

1. Surface area reduction: The specific surface area of NiMoO4 decreases significantly after catalytic reactions, which may lead to reduced catalyst activity over time.

2. Oxidation state control: Maintaining the optimal reduced state of the catalyst surface during prolonged operation may be challenging.

3. Potential carbon deposition: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, carbon deposition is a common issue in ODHP processes and could lead to catalyst deactivation.

Strategies or research directions to address these limitations:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved stability and resistance to surface area reduction, possibly through the use of support materials or promoters that maintain high dispersion of active sites.

2. In-situ regeneration: Investigate methods for periodic regeneration of the catalyst to restore its optimal oxidation state and remove any deposited carbon.

3. Optimize N2O concentration: Conduct further studies to determine the optimal N2O concentration in the feed gas to balance selectivity improvement with catalyst stability.

4. Explore synergistic effects: Investigate the combined use of N2O with other gas dopes or catalyst additives to enhance both selectivity and stability.

5. Advanced characterization techniques: Utilize in-situ or operando spectroscopic methods to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation state during the reaction.

6. Kinetic and mechanistic studies: Conduct detailed kinetic and mechanistic investigations to elucidate the exact role of N2O in the reaction and its interaction with the catalyst surface.

7. Process engineering: Explore reactor designs or operating conditions that can help maintain the optimal catalyst state while using N2O as an oxidant.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible option for practical implementation in the production of propylene.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的使用在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有几个优势：

1. 提高选择性：N2O增加了丙烯的选择性，同时降低了丙烷和氧气的转化率以及CO2的产率。这表明N2O促进了目标产物（丙烯）的形成，同时最大限度地减少了不需要的副反应。

2. 促进催化剂还原：N2O促进催化剂表面钼的还原。催化剂的这种还原状态与丙烯形成的更高选择性相关。

3. 抑制氧气吸附：N2O被认为抑制了氧气在催化剂表面（如NiMoO4）的吸附，这促进了催化剂更还原的状态，有助于提高选择性。

4. 可调节的氧化状态：在进料中添加N2O作为气体掺杂剂，可以调节催化剂表面原子的氧化状态，这对于优化选择性至关重要。

这个过程中使用的各种催化剂包括：

1. NiMoO4：用作ODHP的基础催化剂。
2. NiMoO4 + α-Sb2O4混合物：向NiMoO4中添加α-Sb2O4有助于通过抑制非选择性位点来控制选择性。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战：

1. 表面积减少：NiMoO4的比表面积在催化反应后显著降低，这可能导致催化剂活性随时间减弱。

2. 氧化状态控制：在长时间运行过程中维持催化剂表面的最佳还原状态可能具有挑战性。

3. 潜在的碳沉积：虽然在给定的文献中没有明确提及，但碳沉积是ODHP过程中的一个常见问题，可能导致催化剂失活。

解决这些限制的策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有改进稳定性和抗表面积减少能力的催化剂，可能通过使用保持活性位点高度分散的支撑材料或促进剂。

2. 原位再生：研究催化剂周期性再生的方法，以恢复其最佳氧化状态并去除沉积的碳。

3. 优化N2O浓度：进行进一步研究，确定进料气体中的最佳N2O浓度，以平衡选择性改进和催化剂稳定性。

4. 探索协同效应：研究N2O与其他气体掺杂剂或催化剂添加剂的组合使用，以同时提高选择性和稳定性。

5. 先进表征技术：利用原位或操作中光谱方法，更好地了解反应过程中催化剂结构和氧化状态的动态变化。

6. 动力学和机理研究：进行详细的动力学和机理研究，阐明N2O在反应中的确切作用及其与催化剂表面的相互作用。

7. 过程工程：探索能够在使用N2O作为氧化剂的同时维持最佳催化剂状态的反应器设计或操作条件。

通过解决这些挑战并推进这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能会成为一个更加可行的丙烯生产实际应用选择。
