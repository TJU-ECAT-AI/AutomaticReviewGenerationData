<questions>

Analyze the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), discussing its advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, the various catalysts employed in this process, and the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability. Additionally, propose strategies or research directions that could address these limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation.

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document focuses on propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as an oxidant and discusses Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts. It does not mention N2O or compare different oxidants for ODHP. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given text.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The document primarily focuses on the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in propane ODH and discusses iron-doped cerium oxide catalysts. It does not mention N2O or compare different oxidants for this process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given text.

To properly address this question, additional literature specifically focused on N2O as an oxidant in ODHP would be required. This would include studies comparing N2O to other oxidants like O2 or CO2, details on catalysts used with N2O, and information on catalyst deactivation and stability issues specific to N2O-ODHP systems.

给定的文献中没有提供任何关于使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中的氧化剂的信息。该文档主要关注二氧化碳(CO2)作为丙烷ODH中的氧化剂的使用,并讨论了掺铁的氧化铈催化剂。它没有提到N2O或比较该过程中的不同氧化剂。因此,我无法根据给定的文本回答这个问题。

要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门针对N2O作为ODHP氧化剂的文献。这应包括将N2O与其他氧化剂(如O2或CO2)进行比较的研究,使用N2O的催化剂的详细信息,以及特定于N2O-ODHP系统的催化剂失活和稳定性问题的信息。
